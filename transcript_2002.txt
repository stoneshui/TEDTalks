It's a great honor to be here with you.,The good news is,I'm very aware of my responsibilities to get you out of here,because I'm the only thing standing between you and the bar.,(Laughter),And the good news is I don't have a prepared speech,,but I have a box of slides.,I have some pictures that represent my life and what I do for a living.,I've learned through experience,that people remember pictures long after they've forgotten words,,and so I hope you'll remember some of the pictures,I'm going to share with you for just a few minutes. 
 The whole story really starts,with me as a high school kid in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,,in a tough neighborhood that everybody gave up on for dead.,And on a Wednesday afternoon,,I was walking down the corridor of my high school,kind of minding my own business. And there was this artist teaching,,who made a great big old ceramic vessel,,and I happened to be looking in the door of the art room --,and if you've ever seen clay done, it's magic --,and I'd never seen anything like that before in my life.,So, I walked in the art room and I said, "What is that?",And he said, "Ceramics. And who are you?",And I said, "I'm Bill Strickland. I want you to teach me that.",And he said, "Well, get your homeroom teacher to sign a piece of paper,that says you can come here, and I'll teach it to you.",And so for the remaining two years of my high school,,I cut all my classes.,(Laughter),But I had the presence of mind,to give the teachers' classes that I cut the pottery that I made,,(Laughter),and they gave me passing grades.,And that's how I got out of high school. 
 And Mr. Ross said,,"You're too smart to die and I don't want it on my conscience,,so I'm leaving this school and I'm taking you with me.",And he drove me out to the University of Pittsburgh,where I filled out a college application and got in on probation.,Well, I'm now a trustee of the university,,and at my installation ceremony I said,,"I'm the guy who came from the neighborhood,who got into the place on probation.,Don't give up on the poor kids, because you never know,what's going to happen to those children in life." 
 What I'm going to show you for a couple of minutes,is a facility that I built in the toughest neighborhood in Pittsburgh,with the highest crime rate.,One is called Bidwell Training Center; it is a vocational school,for ex-steel workers and single parents and welfare mothers.,You remember we used to make steel in Pittsburgh?,Well, we don't make any steel anymore,,and the people who used to make the steel,are having a very tough time of it.,And I rebuild them and give them new life. 
 Manchester Craftsmen's Guild is named after my neighborhood.,I was adopted,by the Bishop of the Episcopal Diocese during the riots,,and he donated a row house. And in that row house,I started Manchester Craftsmen's Guild,,and I learned very quickly that wherever there are Episcopalians,,there's money in very close proximity.,(Laughter),And the Bishop adopted me as his kid.,And last year I spoke at his memorial service,and wished him well in this life.,I went out and hired a student of Frank Lloyd Wright, the architect,,and I asked him to build me a world class center,in the worst neighborhood in Pittsburgh.,And my building was a scale model for the Pittsburgh airport.,And when you come to Pittsburgh -- and you're all invited --,you'll be flying into the blown-up version of my building.,That's the building.,Built in a tough neighborhood where people have been given up for dead. 
 My view is that if you want to involve yourself,in the life of people who have been given up on,,you have to look like the solution and not the problem.,As you can see, it has a fountain in the courtyard.,And the reason it has a fountain in the courtyard is I wanted one,and I had the checkbook, so I bought one and put it there.,(Laughter),And now that I'm giving speeches at conferences like TED,,I got put on the board of the Carnegie Museum.,At a reception in their courtyard, I noticed that they had a fountain,because they think that the people who go to the museum deserve a fountain.,Well, I think that welfare mothers and at-risk kids,and ex-steel workers deserve a fountain in their life.,And so the first thing that you see in my center in the springtime,is water that greets you -- water is life and water of human possibility --,and it sets an attitude and expectation,about how you feel about people before you ever give them a speech.,So, from that fountain I built this building. 
 As you can see, it has world class art, and it's all my taste,because I raised all the money.,(Laughter),I said to my boy, "When you raise the money,,we'll put your taste on the wall.",That we have quilts and clay and calligraphy,and everywhere your eye turns,,there's something beautiful looking back at you,,that's deliberate.,That's intentional.,In my view, it is this kind of world,that can redeem the soul of poor people. 
 We also created a boardroom,,and I hired a Japanese cabinetmaker from Kyoto, Japan,,and commissioned him to do 60 pieces of furniture for our building.,We have since spun him off into his own business.,He's making a ton of money doing custom furniture for rich people.,And I got 60 pieces out of it for my school,because I felt that welfare moms and ex-steel workers,and single parents deserved to come to a school,where there was handcrafted furniture that greeted them every day.,Because it sets a tone and an attitude about how you feel about people,long before you give them the speech. 
 We even have flowers in the hallway, and they're not plastic.,Those are real and they're in my building every day.,And now that I've given lots of speeches,,we had a bunch of high school principals come and see me,,and they said, "Mr. Strickland,,what an extraordinary story and what a great school.,And we were particularly touched by the flowers,and we were curious as to how the flowers got there.",I said, "Well, I got in my car and I went out to the greenhouse,and I bought them and I brought them back and I put them there.",You don't need a task force or a study group to buy flowers for your kids.,What you need to know is that the children,and the adults deserve flowers in their life.,The cost is incidental but the gesture is huge.,And so in my building, which is full of sunlight and full of flowers,,we believe in hope and human possibilities.,That happens to be at Christmas time. 
 And so the next thing you'll see is a million dollar kitchen,that was built by the Heinz company -- you've heard of them?,They did all right in the ketchup business.,And I happen to know that company pretty well,because John Heinz, who was our U.S. senator --,who was tragically killed in a plane accident --,he had heard about my desire to build a new building,,because I had a cardboard box and I put it in a garbage bag,and I walking all over Pittsburgh trying to raise money for this site.,And he called me into his office --,which is the equivalent of going to see the Wizard of Oz,(Laughter) --,and John Heinz had 600 million dollars, and at the time I had about 60 cents.,And he said, "But we've heard about you.,We've heard about your work with the kids and the ex-steel workers,,and we're inclined to want to support your desire to build a new building.,And you could do us a great service,if you would add a culinary program to your program.",Because back then, we were building a trades program.,He said, "That way we could fulfill our affirmative action goals,for the Heinz company.",I said, "Senator, I'm reluctant to go into a field,that I don't know much about, but I promise you,that if you'll support my school, I'll get it built,and in a couple of years, I'll come back,and weigh out that program that you desire.",And Senator Heinz sat very quietly and he said,,"Well, what would your reaction be,if I said I'd give you a million dollars?",I said, "Senator, it appears that we're going into the food training business.",(Laughter),And John Heinz did give me a million bucks.,And most importantly,,he loaned me the head of research for the Heinz company.,And we kind of borrowed the curriculum from the Culinary Institute of America,,which in their mind is kind of the Harvard of cooking schools,,and we created a gourmet cooks program for welfare mothers,in this million dollar kitchen in the middle of the inner city.,And we've never looked back. 
 I would like to show you now some of the food,that these welfare mothers do in this million dollar kitchen.,That happens to be our cafeteria line.,That's puff pastry day. Why?,Because the students made puff pastry,and that's what the school ate every day.,But the concept was that I wanted to take the stigma out of food.,That good food's not for rich people --,good food's for everybody on the planet,,and there's no excuse why we all can't be eating it.,So at my school, we subsidize a gourmet lunch program,for welfare mothers in the middle of the inner city,because we've discovered that it's good for their stomachs,,but it's better for their heads.,Because I wanted to let them know every day of their life,that they have value at this place I call my center. 
 We have students who sit together, black kids and white kids,,and what we've discovered is you can solve the race problem,by creating a world class environment,,because people will have a tendency to show you world class behavior,if you treat them in that way.,These are examples of the food that welfare mothers are doing,after six months in the training program.,No sophistication, no class, no dignity, no history.,What we've discovered is the only thing wrong with poor people,is they don't have any money, which happens to be a curable condition.,It's all in the way that you think about people,that often determines their behavior.,That was done by a student after seven months in the program,,done by a very brilliant young woman,who was taught by our pastry chef.,I've actually eaten seven of those baskets and they're very good.,(Laughter),They have no calories.,That's our dining room.,It looks like your average high school cafeteria,in your average town in America.,But this is my view of how students ought to be treated,,particularly once they have been pushed aside. 
 We train pharmaceutical technicians for the pharmacy industry,,we train medical technicians for the medical industry,,and we train chemical technicians for companies,like Bayer and Calgon Carbon and Fisher Scientific and Exxon.,And I will guarantee you that if you come to my center in Pittsburgh --,and you're all invited --,you'll see welfare mothers doing analytical chemistry,with logarithmic calculators,10 months from enrolling in the program.,There is absolutely no reason why poor people,can't learn world class technology.,What we've discovered is you have to give them flowers,and sunlight and food and expectations and Herbie's music,,and you can cure a spiritual cancer every time. 
 We train corporate travel agents for the travel industry.,We even teach people how to read.,The kid with the red stripe was in the program two years ago --,he's now an instructor.,And I have children with high school diplomas that they can't read.,And so you must ask yourself the question:,how is it possible in the 21st century,that we graduate children from schools,who can't read the diplomas that they have in their hands?,The reason is that the system gets reimbursed,for the kids they spit out the other end, not the children who read.,I can take these children and in 20 weeks,,demonstrated aptitude; I can get them high school equivalent.,No big deal.,That's our library with more handcrafted furniture.,And this is the arts program I started in 1968. 
 Remember I'm the black kid from the '60s who got his life saved with ceramics.,Well, I went out and decided to reproduce my experience,with other kids in the neighborhood,,the theory being if you get kids flowers and you give them food,and you give them sunshine and enthusiasm,,you can bring them right back to life.,I have 400 kids from the Pittsburgh public school system,that come to me every day of the week for arts education.,And these are children who are flunking out of public school.,And last year I put 88 percent of those kids in college,and I've averaged over 80 percent for 15 years.,We've made a fascinating discovery:,there's nothing wrong with the kids,that affection and sunshine and food and enthusiasm,and Herbie's music can't cure.,For that I won a big old plaque -- Man of the Year in Education.,I beat out all the Ph.D.'s,because I figured that if you treat children like human beings,,it increases the likelihood they're going to behave that way.,And why we can't institute that policy,in every school and in every city and every town,remains a mystery to me. 
 Let me show you what these people do.,We have ceramics and photography and computer imaging.,And these are all kids with no artistic ability, no talent,,no imagination. And we bring in the world's greatest artists --,Gordon Parks has been there, Chester Higgins has been there --,and what we've learned,is that the children will become like the people who teach them.,In fact, I brought in a mosaic artist from the Vatican,,an African-American woman,who had studied the old Vatican mosaic techniques,,and let me show you what they did with the work.,These were children who the whole world had given up on,,who were flunking out of public school,,and that's what they're capable of doing,with affection and sunlight and food and good music and confidence. 
 We teach photography.,And these are examples of some of the kids' work.,That boy won a four-year scholarship,on the strength of that photograph.,This is our gallery.,We have a world class gallery,because we believe that poor kids need a world class gallery,,so I designed this thing.,We have smoked salmon at the art openings,,we have a formal printed invitation,,and I even have figured out a way to get their parents to come.,I couldn't buy a parent 15 years ago,so I hired a guy who got off on the Jesus big time.,He was dragging guys out of bars,and saving those lives for the Lord.,And I said, "Bill, I want to hire you, man.,You have to tone down the Jesus stuff a little bit,,but keep the enthusiasm.,(Laughter) (Applause),I can't get these parents to come to the school.",He said, "I'll get them to come to the school.",So, he jumped in the van, he went to Miss Jones' house and said,,"Miss Jones, I knew you wanted to come to your kid's art opening,but you probably didn't have a ride.,So, I came to give you a ride.",And he got 10 parents and then 20 parents.,At the last show that we did, 200 parents showed up,and we didn't pick up one parent.,Because now it's become socially not acceptable not to show up,to support your children at the Manchester Craftsmen's Guild,because people think you're bad parents.,And there is no statistical difference,between the white parents and the black parents.,Mothers will go where their children are being celebrated,,every time, every town, every city.,I wanted you to see this gallery because it's as good as it gets.,And by the time I cut these kids loose from high school,,they've got four shows on their resume,before they apply to college because it's all up here. 
 You have to change the way that people see themselves,before you can change their behavior.,And it's worked out pretty good up to this day.,I even stuck another room on the building, which I'd like to show you.,This is brand new.,We just got this slide done in time for the TED Conference.,I gave this little slide show at a place called the Silicon Valley,and I did all right.,And the woman came out of the audience,,she said, "That was a great story,and I was very impressed with your presentation.,My only criticism is your computers are getting a little bit old.",And I said, "Well, what do you do for a living?",She said, "Well, I work for a company called Hewlett-Packard.",And I said, "You're in the computer business, is that right?",She said, "Yes, sir.",And I said, "Well, there's an easy solution to that problem.",Well, I'm very pleased to announce to you that HP,and a furniture company called Steelcase,have adopted us as a demonstration model for all of their technology,and all their furniture for the United States of America.,And that's the room,that's initiating the relationship.,We got it just done in time to show you,,so it's kind of the world debut of our digital imaging center.,(Applause),(Music) 
 I only have a couple more slides,,and this is where the story gets kind of interesting.,So, I just want you to listen up for a couple more minutes,and you'll understand why he's there and I'm here.,In 1986, I had the presence of mind to stick a music hall,on the north end of the building while I was building it.,And a guy named Dizzy Gillespie showed up to play there,because he knew this man over here, Marty Ashby.,And I stood on that stage with Dizzy Gillespie on sound check,on a Wednesday afternoon, and I said,,"Dizzy, why would you come to a black-run center,in the middle of an industrial park with a high crime rate,that doesn't even have a reputation in music?",He said, "Because I heard you built the center,and I didn't believe that you did it, and I wanted to see for myself.,And now that I have, I want to give you a gift.",I said, "You're the gift.",He said, "No, sir. You're the gift.,And I'm going to allow you to record the concert,and I'm going to give you the music,,and if you ever choose to sell it, you must sign an agreement,that says the money will come back and support the school.",And I recorded Dizzy. And he died a year later,,but not before telling a fellow named McCoy Tyner what we were doing.,And he showed up and said,,"Dizzy talking about you all over the country, man,,and I want to help you.",And then a guy named Wynton Marsalis showed up.,Then a bass player named Ray Brown,,and a fellow named Stanley Turrentine,,and a piano player named Herbie Hancock,,and a band called the Count Basie Orchestra,,and a fellow named Tito Puente,,and a guy named Gary Burton, and Shirley Horn, and Betty Carter,,and Dakota Staton and Nancy Wilson,all have come to this center in the middle of an industrial park,to sold out audiences in the middle of the inner city.,And I'm very pleased to tell you that, with their permission,,I have now accumulated 600 recordings,of the greatest artists in the world,,including Joe Williams, who died,,but not before his last recording was done at my school.,And Joe Williams came up to me and he put his hand on my shoulder,and he said, "God's picked you, man, to do this work.,And I want my music to be with you.",And that worked out all right. 
 When the Basie band came, the band got so excited about the school,they voted to give me the rights to the music.,And I recorded it and we won something called a Grammy.,And like a fool, I didn't go to the ceremony,because I didn't think we were going to win.,Well, we did win,,and our name was literally in lights over Madison Square Garden.,Then the U.N. Jazz Orchestra dropped by and we recorded them,and got nominated for a second Grammy back to back.,So, we've become one of the hot, young jazz recording studios,in the United States of America,(Laughter),in the middle of the inner city with a high crime rate. 
 That's the place all filled up with Republicans.,(Laughter),(Applause),If you'd have dropped a bomb on that room,,you'd have wiped out all the money in Pennsylvania,because it was all sitting there.,Including my mother and father, who lived long enough,to see their kid build that building.,And there's Dizzy, just like I told you. He was there.,And he was there, Tito Puente.,And Pat Metheny and Jim Hall were there,and they recorded with us.,And that was our first recording studio, which was the broom closet.,We put the mops in the hallway and re-engineered the thing,and that's where we recorded the first Grammy. 
 And this is our new facility, which is all video technology.,And that is a room that was built for a woman named Nancy Wilson,,who recorded that album at our school last Christmas.,And any of you who happened to have been watching Oprah Winfrey,on Christmas Day, he was there and Nancy was there,singing excerpts from this album,,the rights to which she donated to our school.,And I can now tell you with absolute certainty,that an appearance on Oprah Winfrey will sell 10,000 CDs.,(Laughter),We are currently number four on the Billboard Charts,,right behind Tony Bennett.,And I think we're going to be fine. 
 This was burned out during the riots -- this is next to my building --,and so I had another cardboard box built,and I walked back out in the streets again.,And that's the building, and that's the model,,and on the right's a high-tech greenhouse,and in the middle's the medical technology building.,And I'm very pleased to tell you that the building's done.,It's also full of anchor tenants at 20 dollars a foot --,triple that in the middle of the inner city.,And there's the fountain.,(Laughter),Every building has a fountain.,And the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center are anchor tenants,and they took half the building,,and we now train medical technicians through all their system.,And Mellon Bank's a tenant.,And I love them because they pay the rent on time.,(Laughter),And as a result of the association,,I'm now a director of the Mellon Financial Corporation,that bought Dreyfus. 
 And this is in the process of being built as we speak.,Multiply that picture times four and you will see the greenhouse,that's going to open in October this year,because we're going to grow those flowers,in the middle of the inner city.,And we're going to have high school kids,growing Phalaenopsis orchids in the middle of the inner city.,And we have a handshake with one of the large retail grocers,to sell our orchids in all 240 stores in six states.,And our partners are Zuma Canyon Orchids of Malibu, California,,who are Hispanic.,So, the Hispanics and the black folks have formed a partnership,to grow high technology orchids in the middle of the inner city.,And I told my United States senator,that there was a very high probability,that if he could find some funding for this,,we would become a left-hand column in the Wall Street Journal,,to which he readily agreed.,And we got the funding and we open in the fall.,And you ought to come and see it -- it's going to be a hell of a story. 
 And this is what I want to do when I grow up.,(Laughter),The brown building is the one you guys have been looking at,and I'll tell you where I made my big mistake.,I had a chance to buy this whole industrial park --,which is less than 1,000 feet from the riverfront --,for four million dollars and I didn't do it.,And I built the first building, and guess what happened?,I appreciated the real estate values beyond everybody's expectations,and the owners of the park turned me down for eight million dollars last year,,and said, "Mr. Strickland,,you ought to get the Civic Leader of the Year Award,because you've appreciated our property values,beyond our wildest expectations.,Thank you very much for that.",The moral of the story is you must be prepared to act on your dreams,,just in case they do come true. 
 And finally, there's this picture.,This is in a place called San Francisco.,And the reason this picture's in here is,I did this slide show a couple years ago at a big economics summit,,and there was a fellow in the audience who came up to me.,He said, "Man, that's a great story.,I want one of those.",I said, "Well, I'm very flattered. What do you do for a living?",He says, "I run the city of San Francisco.,My name's Willie Brown.",And so I kind of accepted the flattery and the praise,and put it out of my mind.,And that weekend, I was going back home,and Herbie Hancock was playing our center that night --,first time I'd met him.,And he walked in and he says, "What is this?",And I said, "Herbie, this is my concept of a training center,for poor people.",And he said, "As God as my witness,,I've had a center like this in my mind for 25 years and you've built it.,And now I really want to build one.",I said, "Well, where would you build this thing?",He said, "San Francisco.",I said, "Any chance you know Willie Brown?",(Laughter),As a matter of fact he did know Willie Brown,,and Willie Brown and Herbie and I had dinner four years ago,,and we started drawing out that center on the tablecloth.,And Willie Brown said, "As sure as I'm the mayor of San Francisco,,I'm going to build this thing,as a legacy to the poor people of this city.",And he got me five acres of land on San Francisco Bay,and we got an architect and we got a general contractor,and we got Herbie on the board,,and our friends from HP, and our friends from Steelcase,,and our friends from Cisco, and our friends from Wells Fargo,and Genentech. 
 And along the way, I met this real short guy,at my slide show in the Silicon Valley.,He came up to me afterwards,,he said, "Man, that's a fabulous story.,I want to help you.",And I said, "Well, thank you very much for that.,What do you do for a living?",He said, "Well, I built a company called eBay.",I said, "Well, that's very nice.,Thanks very much, and give me your card and sometime we'll talk.",I didn't know eBay from that jar of water sitting on that piano,,but I had the presence of mind to go back,and talk to one of the techie kids at my center.,I said, "Hey man, what is eBay?",He said, "Well, that's the electronic commerce network.",I said, "Well, I met the guy who built the thing,and he left me his card.",So, I called him up on the phone and I said, "Mr. Skoll,,I've come to have a much deeper appreciation of who you are,(Laughter),and I'd like to become your friend.",(Laughter),And Jeff and I did become friends,,and he's organized a team of people,and we're going to build this center. 
 And I went down into the neighborhood called Bayview-Hunters Point,,and I said, "The mayor sent me down here to work with you,and I want to build a center with you,,but I'm not going to build you anything if you don't want it.,And all I've got is a box of slides.",And so I stood up in front of 200 very angry, very disappointed people,on a summer night, and the air conditioner had broken,and it was 100 degrees outside,,and I started showing these pictures.,And after about 10 pictures they all settled down.,And I ran the story and I said, "What do you think?",And in the back of the room, a woman stood up and she said,,"In 35 years of living in this God forsaken place,,you're the only person that's come down here and treated us with dignity.,I'm going with you, man.",And she turned that audience around on a pin.,And I promised these people that I was going to build this thing,,and we're going to build it all right.,And I think we can get in the ground this year,as the first replication of the center in Pittsburgh. 
 But I met a guy named Quincy Jones along the way,and I showed him the box of slides.,And Quincy said, "I want to help you, man.,Let's do one in L.A.",And so he's assembled a group of people.,And I've fallen in love with him,,as I have with Herbie and with his music.,And Quincy said, "Where did the idea for centers like this come from?",And I said, "It came from your music, man.,Because Mr. Ross used to bring in your albums,when I was 16 years old in the pottery class,,when the world was all dark,,and your music got me to the sunlight.",And I said, "If I can follow that music,,I'll get out into the sunlight and I'll be OK.,And if that's not true, how did I get here?" 
 I want you all to know,that I think the world is a place that's worth living.,I believe in you.,I believe in your hopes and your dreams,,I believe in your intelligence,and I believe in your enthusiasm.,And I'm tired of living like this,,going into town after town with people standing around on corners,with holes where eyes used to be, their spirits damaged.,We won't make it as a country unless we can turn this thing around.,In Pennsylvania it costs 60,000 dollars to keep people in jail,,most of whom look like me.,It's 40,000 dollars to build the University of Pittsburgh Medical School.,It's 20,000 dollars cheaper to build a medical school than to keep people in jail.,Do the math -- it will never work.,I am banking on you,and I'm banking on guys like Herbie and Quincy and Hackett and Richard,and very decent people who still believe in something.,And I want to do this in my lifetime, in every city and in every town.,And I don't think I'm crazy.,I think we can get home on this thing,and I think we can build these all over the country,for less money than we're spending on prisons.,And I believe we can turn this whole story around,to one of celebration and one of hope.,In my business it's very difficult work.,You're always fighting upstream like a salmon --,never enough money, too much need --,and so there is a tendency,to have an occupational depression that accompanies my work.,And so I've figured out, over time, the solution to the depression:,you make a friend in every town and you'll never be lonely.,And my hope is that I've made a few here tonight.,And thanks for listening to what I had to say.,(Applause)This is your conference,,and I think you have a right to know a little bit right now, in this transition period,,about this guy who's going to be looking after it for you for a bit.,So, I'm just going to grab a chair here. 
 Two years ago at TED, I think --,I've come to this conclusion --,I think I may have been suffering from a strange delusion.,I think that I may have believed unconsciously,,then, that I was kind of a business hero.,I had this company that I'd spent 15 years building. It's called Future;,it was a magazine publishing company.,It had recently gone public,and the market said that it was apparently worth two billion dollars,,a number I didn't really understand.,A magazine I'd recently launched called Business 2.0,was fatter than a telephone directory,,busy pumping hot air into the bubble.,(Laughter),And I was the 40 percent owner of a dotcom,that was about to go public and no doubt be worth billions more.,And all this had come from nothing.,Fifteen years earlier, I was a science journalist who people just laughed at,when I said, "I really would like to start my own computer magazine.",And 15 years later, there are 100 of them,and 2,000 people on staff and it was just such heady times.,The date was February 2000.,I thought the little graph of my business life,that kind of looked a bit like Moore's Law --,ever upward and to the right -- it was going to go on forever.,I mean, it had to. Right? I was in for quite a surprise. 
 The dotcom, ironically called Snowball,,was the very last consumer web company to go public,the next month before NASDAQ exploded, and I entered 18 months of business hell.,I watched everything that I'd built crumbling,,and it looked like all this stuff was going to die,and 15 years work would have come for nothing.,And it was gut wrenching.,It took eight years of blood, sweat and tears to reach 350 employees,,something which I was very proud of in the business.,February 2001 -- in one day we laid off 350 people,,and before the bloodshed was finished, 1,000 people had lost their jobs,from my companies. I felt sick.,I watched my own net worth falling,by about a million dollars a day, every day, for 18 months.,And worse than that, far worse than that,,my sense of self-worth was kind of evaporating.,I was going around with this big sign on my forehead: "LOSER.",(Laughter),And I think what disgusts me more than anything, looking back,,is how the hell did I let my personal happiness,get so tied up with this business thing? 
 Well, in the end, we were able to save Future and Snowball,,but I was, at that point, ready to move on.,And to cut a long story short, here's where I came to.,And the reason I'm telling this story is that I believe, from many conversations,,that a lot of people in this room have been through a similar kind of rollercoaster --,emotional rollercoaster -- in the last couple years.,This has been a big, big transition time,,and I believe that this conference can play a big part for all of us,in taking us forward to the next stage to whatever's next.,The theme next year is re-birth. 
 It was at the same TED two years ago,when Richard and I reached an agreement on the future of TED.,And at about the same time, and I think partly because of that,,I started doing something that I'd forgotten about in my business focus:,I started to read again.,And I discovered that while I'd been busy playing business games,,there'd been this incredible revolution in so many areas of interest:,cosmology to psychology to evolutionary psychology to anthropology,to ... all this stuff had changed.,And the way in which you could think about us as a species,and us as a planet had just changed so much, and it was incredibly exciting.,And what was really most exciting --,and I think Richard Wurman discovered this at least 20 years before I did --,was that all this stuff is connected.,It's connected; it all hooks into each other. 
 We talk about this a lot,,and I thought about trying to give an example of this. So, just one example:,Madame de Gaulle, the wife of the French president,,was famously asked once, "What do you most desire?",And she answered, "A penis.",And when you think about it, it's very true:,what we all most desire is a penis --,or "happiness" as we say in English.,(Laughter),And something ... good luck with that one in the Japanese translation room.,(Laughter),(Applause) 
 But something as basic as happiness,,which 20 years ago would have been just something for discussion,in the church or mosque or synagogue,,today it turns out that there's dozens of TED-like questions,that you can ask about it, which are really interesting.,You can ask about what causes it biochemically:,neuroscience, serotonin, all that stuff.,You can ask what are the psychological causes of it:,nature? Nurture? Current circumstance?,Turns out that the research done on that is absolutely mind-blowing.,You can view it as a computing problem, an artificial intelligence problem:,do you need to incorporate,some sort of analog of happiness into a computer brain to make it work properly?,You can view it in sort of geopolitical terms,and say, why is it that a billion people on this planet,are so desperately needy that they have no possibility of happiness,,and whereas almost all the rest of them,,regardless of how much money they have -- whether it's two dollars a day or whatever --,are almost equally happy on average?,Or you can view it as an evolutionary psychology kind of thing:,did our genes invent this as a kind of trick,to get us to behave in certain ways? The ant's brain, parasitized,,to make us behave in certain ways so that our genes would propagate?,Are we the victims of a mass delusion?,And so on, and so on. 
 To understand even something as important to us as happiness,,you kind of have to branch off in all these different directions,,and there's nowhere that I've discovered -- other than TED --,where you can ask that many questions in that many different directions.,And so, it's the profound thing that Richard talks about:,to understand anything, you just need to understand the little bits;,a little bit about everything that surrounds it.,And so, gradually over these three days,,you start off kind of trying to figure out,,"Why am I listening to all this irrelevant stuff?",And at the end of the four days,,your brain is humming and you feel energized, alive and excited,,and it's because all these different bits have been put together.,It's the total brain experience, we're going to ...,it's the mental equivalent of the full body massage.,(Laughter),Every mental organ addressed. It really is. 
 Enough of the theory, Chris. Tell us what you're actually going to do, all right?,So, I will. Here's the vision for TED. 
 Number one: do nothing. This thing ain't broke, so I ain't gonna fix it.,Jeff Bezos kindly remarked to me,,"Chris, TED is a really great conference.,You're going to have to fuck up really badly to make it bad.",(Laughter),So, I gave myself the job title of TED Custodian for a reason,,and I will promise you right here and now,that the core values that make TED special are not going to be interfered with.,Truth, curiosity, diversity, no selling, no corporate bullshit,,no bandwagoning, no platforms.,Just the pursuit of interest, wherever it lies,,across all the disciplines that are represented here.,That's not going to be changed at all. 
 Number two: I am going to put together,an incredible line up of speakers for next year.,The time scale on which TED operates is just fantastic,after coming out of a magazine business with monthly deadlines.,There's a year to do this, and already --,I hope to show you a bit later --,there's 25 or so terrific speakers signed up for next year.,And I'm getting fantastic help from the community;,this is just such a great community. And combined, our contacts,reach pretty much everyone who's interesting in the country, if not the planet.,It's true. 
 Number three: I do want to, if I can, find a way,of extending the TED experience throughout the year a little bit.,And one key way that we're going to do this is to introduce this book club.,Books kind of saved me in the last couple years,,and that's a gift that I would like to pass on.,So, when you sign up for TED2003, every six weeks you'll get a care package,with a book or two and a reason why they're linked to TED.,They may well be by a TED speaker,,and so we can get the conversation going during the year,and come back next year having had the same intellectual, emotional journey.,I think it will be great. 
 And then, fourthly: I want to mention the Sapling Foundation,,which is the new owner of TED.,What Sapling's ownership means is that all of the proceeds of TED,will go towards the causes that Sapling stands for.,And more important, I think, the ideas that are exhibited and realized here,are ideas that the foundation can use, because there's fantastic synergy.,Already, just in the last few days,,we've had so many people talking about stuff that they care about,,that they're passionate about, that can make a difference in the world,,and the idea of getting this group of people together --,some of the causes that we believe in,,the money that this conference can raise and the ideas --,I really believe that that combination will, over time, make a difference.,I'm incredibly excited about that.,In fact, I don't think, overall, that I've been as excited by anything ever in my life.,I'm in this for the long run,,and I would be greatly honored and excited,if you'll come on this journey with me.What I want to talk about is, as background,,is the idea that cars are art.,This is actually quite meaningful to me,,because car designers tend to be a little bit low on the totem pole --,we don't do coffee table books with just one lamp inside of it --,and cars are thought so much as a product,that it's a little bit difficult to get into the aesthetic side,under the same sort of terminology that one would discuss art.,And so cars, as art, brings it into an emotional plane -- if you accept that --,that you have to deal with on the same level you would with art with a capital A. 
 Now at this point you're going to see a picture of Michelangelo.,This is completely different than automobiles.,Automobiles are self-moving things, right? Elevators are automobiles.,And they're not very emotional; they solve a purpose;,and certainly automobiles have been around for 100 years,and have made our lives functionally a lot better in many ways;,they've also been a real pain in the ass,,because automobiles are really the thing we have to solve.,We have to solve the pollution, we have to solve the congestion --,but that's not what interests me in this speech. 
 What interests me in this speech is cars. Automobiles may be what you use,,but cars are what we are, in many ways.,And as long as we can solve the problems of automobiles,,and I believe we can, with fuel cells or hydrogen, like BMW is really hip on,,and lots of other things, then I think we can look past that,and try and understand why this hook is in many of us --,of this car-y-ness -- and what that means, what we can learn from it.,That's what I want to get to. Cars are not a suit of clothes;,cars are an avatar. Cars are an expansion of yourself:,they take your thoughts, your ideas, your emotions, and they multiply it --,your anger, whatever. It's an avatar.,It's a super-waldo that you happen to be inside of, and if you feel sexy,,the car is sexy. And if you're full of road rage,,you've got a "Chevy: Like a Rock," right? 
 Cars are a sculpture -- did you know this?,That every car you see out there is sculpted by hand.,Many people think, "Well, it's computers,,and it's done by machines and stuff like that.",Well, they reproduce it, but the originals are all done by hand.,It's done by men and women who believe a lot in their craft.,And they put that same kind of tension into the sculpting of a car,that you do in a great sculpture that you would go and look at in a museum.,That tension between the need to express, the need to discover,,then you put something new into it,,and at the same time you have bounds of craftsmanship.,Rules that say, this is how you handle surfaces;,this is what control is all about; this is how you show you're a master of your craft.,And that tension, that discovery, that push for something new --,and at the same time, that sense of obligation,to the regards of craftsmanship --,that's as strong in cars as it is in anything.,We work in clay, which hasn't changed much,since Michelangelo started screwing around with it,,and there's a very interesting analogy to that too.,Real quickly -- Michelangelo once said he's there to "discover the figure within," OK?,There we go, the automobile.,That was 100 years right there -- did you catch that?,Between that one there, and that one there, it changed a lot didn't it?,OK, it's not marketing; there's a very interesting car concept here,,but the marketing part is not what I want to talk about here.,I want to talk about this.,Why it means you have to wash a car, what is it, that sensuality,you have to touch about it? That's the sculpture that goes into it. That sensuality.,And it's done by men and women working just like this, making cars. 
 Now this little quote about sculpture from Henry Moore,,I believe that that "pressure within" that Moore's talking about --,at least when it comes to cars --,comes right back to this idea of the mean.,It's that will to live, that need to survive, to express itself,,that comes in a car, and takes over people like me.,And we tell other people, "Do this, do this, do this," until this thing comes alive.,We are completely infected. And beauty can be the result,of this infectiousness; it's quite wonderful.,This sculpture is, of course, at the heart of all of it,,and it's really what puts the craftsmanship into our cars.,And it's not a whole lot different, really, when they're working like this,,or when somebody works like this.,It's that same kind of commitment, that same kind of beauty. 
 Now, now I get to the point. I want to talk about cars as art.,Art, in the Platonic sense, is truth; it's beauty, and love.,Now this is really where designers in car business diverge from the engineers.,We don't really have a problem talking about love.,We don't have a problem talking about truth or beauty in that sense.,That's what we're searching for --,when we're working our craft, we are really trying to find that truth out there.,We're not trying to find vanity and beauty.,We're trying to find the beauty in the truth.,However, engineers tend to look at things a little bit more Newtonian,,instead of this quantum approach.,We're dealing with irrationalisms,,and we're dealing with paradoxes that we admit exist,,and the engineers tend to look things a little bit more like,two and two is four, and if you get 4.0 it's better, and 4.000 is even better.,And that sometimes leads to bit of a divergence,in why we're doing what we're doing.,We've pretty much accepted the fact, though,,that we are the women in the organization at BMW --,BMW is a very manly type business, -- men, men, men; it's engineers.,And we're kind of the female side to that. That's OK,,that's cool. You go off and be manly. We're going to be a little bit more female.,Because what we're interested in is finding form that's more than just a function. 
 We're interested in finding beauty that's more than just an aesthetic;,it's really a truth.,And I think this idea of soul, as being at the heart of great cars,,is very applicable. You all know it. You know a car when you've seen it,,with soul. You know how strong this is.,Well, this experience of love, and the experience of design, to me,,are interchangeable. And now I'm coming to my story. 
 I discovered something about love and design through a project called Deep Blue.,And first of all, you have to go with me for a second, and say,,you know, you could take the word "love" out of a lot of things in our society,,put the word "design" in, and it still works,,like this quote here, you know. It kind of works, you know?,You can understand that. It works in truisms.,"All is fair in design and war.",Certainly we live in a competitive society.,I think this one here, there's a pop song,that really describes Philippe Starck for me, you know, this is like,you know, this is like puppy love, you know, this is cool right?,Toothbrush, cool.,It really only gets serious when you look at something like this. OK? 
 (Laughter) 
 This is one substitution that I believe,all of us, in design management, are guilty of.,And this idea that there is more to love,,more to design, when it gets down to your neighbor, your other,,it can be physical like this, and maybe in the future it will be.,But right now it's in dealing with our own people,,our own teams who are doing the creating. So, to my story.,The idea of people-work is what we work with here,,and I have to make a bond with my designers when we're creating BMWs.,We have to have a shared intimacy, a shared vision --,that means we have to work as one family;,we have to understand ourselves that way.,There's good times; there's interesting times;,and there's some stress times too.,You want to do cars, you've got to go outside.,You've got to do cars in the rain; you've got to do cars in the snow.,That's, by the way, is a presentation we made to our board of directors.,We haul their butts out in the snow, too. You want to know cars outside?,Well, you've got to stand outside to do this.,And because these are artists, they have very artistic temperaments.,All right? Now one thing about art is, art is discovery,,and art is discovering yourself through your art. Right?,And one thing about cars is we're all a little bit like Pygmalion,,we are completely in love with our own creations.,This is one of my favorite paintings, it really describes our relationship with cars.,This is sick beyond belief. 
 (Laughter) 
 But because of this, the intimacy with which we work together as a team,takes on a new dimension, a new meaning.,We have a shared center; we have a shared focus --,that car stays at the middle of all our relationships.,And it's my job, in the competitive process, to narrow this down.,I heard today about Joseph's death genes,that have to go in and kill cell reproduction.,You know, that's what I have to do sometimes.,We start out with 10 cars; we narrow it down to five cars,,down to three cars, down to two cars, down to one car,,and I'm in the middle of that killing, basically.,Someone's love, someone's baby.,This is very difficult, and you have to have a bond with your team,that permits you to do this, because their life is wrapped up in that too.,They've got that gene infected in them as well,,and they want that to live, more than anything else. 
 Well, this project, Deep Blue, put me in contact with my team,in a way that I never expected, and I want to pass it on to you,,because I want you to reflect on this, perhaps in your own relationships.,We wanted to a do a car which was a complete leap of faith for BMW.,We wanted to do a team which was so removed from the way we'd done it,,that I only had a phone number that connected me to them.,So, what we did was: instead of having a staff of artists that are just your wrist,,we decided to free up a team of creative designers and engineers,to find out what's the successor to the SUV phenomenon in America.,This is 1996 we did this project. And so we sent them off with this team name,,Deep Blue. Now many people know Deep Blue from IBM --,we actually stole it from them because we figured,if anybody read our faxes they'd think we're talking about computers.,It turned out it was quite clever because Deep Blue,,in a company like BMW, has a hook -- "Deep Blue," wow, cool name.,So people get wrapped up in it. And we took a team of designers,,and we sent them off to America. And we gave them a budget,,what we thought was a set of deliverables,,a timetable, and nothing else.,Like I said, I just had a phone number that connected me to them. 
 And a group of engineers worked in Germany,,and the idea was they would work separately,on this problem of what's the successor to the SUV.,They would come together, compare notes. Then they would work apart,,come together, and they would produce together,a monumental set of diverse opinions that didn't pollute each other's ideas --,but at the same time came together and resolved the problems.,Hopefully, really understand the customer at its heart,,where the customer is, live with them in America. So -- sent the team off,,and actually something different happened. They went other places. 
 (Laughter) 
 They disappeared, quite honestly, and all I got was postcards.,Now, I got some postcards of these guys in Las Vegas,,and I got some postcards of these guys in the Grand Canyon,,and I got these postcards of Niagara Falls,,and pretty soon they're in New York, and I don't know where else.,And I'm telling myself, "This is going to be a great car,,they're doing research that I've never even thought about before.",Right? And they decided that instead of, like, having a studio,,and six or seven apartments,,it was cheaper to rent Elizabeth Taylor's ex-house in Malibu.,And -- at least they told me it was her house,,I guess it was at one time, she had a party there or something.,But anyway, this was the house, and they all lived there.,Now this is 24/7 living, half-a-dozen people who'd left their --,some had left their wives behind and families behind,,and they literally lived in this house,for the entire six months the project was in America,,but the first three months were the most intensive.,And one of the young women in the project,,she was a fantastic lady, she actually built her room in the bathroom.,The bathroom was so big, she built the bed over the bathtub --,it's quite fascinating. 
 On the other hand, I didn't know anything about this. OK?,Nothing. This is all going on, and all I'm getting is postcards,of these guys in Las Vegas, or whatever,,saying, "Don't worry Chris, this is really going to be good." OK?,So my concept of what a design studio was probably --,I wasn't up to speed on where these guys were. 
 However, the engineers back in Munich,had taken on this kind of Newtonian solution,,and they were trying to find how many cup holders,can dance on the head of a pin, and, you know,,these really serious questions that are confronting the modern consumer.,And one was hoping that these two teams would get together,,and this collusion of incredible creativity,,under these incredible surroundings,,and these incredibly stressed-out engineers,,would create some incredible solutions.,Well, what I didn't know was, and what we found out was --,these guys, they can't even like talk to each other under those conditions.,You get a divergence of Newtonian and quantum thinking at that point,,you have a split in your dialog that is so deep, and so far,,that they cannot bring this together at all. 
 And so we had our first meeting, after three months, in Tiburon,,which is just up the road from here -- you know Tiburon?,And the idea was after the first three months of this independent research,they would present it all to Dr. Goschel --,who is now my boss, and at that time he was co-mentor on the project --,and they would present their results.,We would see where we were going,,we would see the first indication of what could be,the successive phenomenon to the SUV in America.,And so I had these ideas in my head, that this is going to be great.,I mean, I'm going to see so much work, it's so intense --,I know probably Las Vegas meant a lot about it,,and I'm not really sure where the Grand Canyon came in either --,but somehow all this is going to come together,,and I'm going to see some really great product.,So we went to Tiburon, after three months,,and the team had gotten together the week before,,many days ahead of time.,The engineers flew over, and designers got together with them,,and they put their presentation together. 
 Well, it turns out that the engineers hadn't done anything.,And they hadn't done anything because --,kind of, like in car business, engineers are there to solve problems,,and we were asking them to create a problem.,And the engineers were waiting for the designers to say,,"This is the problem that we've created, now help us solve it.",And they couldn't talk about it. So what happened was,,the engineers showed up with nothing.,And the engineers told the designers,,"If you go in with all your stuff, we'll walk out,,we'll walk right out of the project." 
 So I didn't know any of this,,and we got a presentation that had an agenda, looked like this.,There was a whole lot of dialog.,We spent four hours being told all about vocabulary,that needs to be built between engineers and designers.,And here I'm expecting at any moment, "OK, they're going to turn the page,,and I'm going to see the cars, I'm going to see the sketches,,I'm going to see maybe some idea of where it's going.",Dialog kept on going, with mental maps of words, and pretty soon,it was becoming obvious that instead of being dazzled with brilliance,,I was seriously being baffled with bullshit.,And if you can imagine what this is like,,to have these months of postcard indication of how great this team is working,,and they're out there spending all this money, and they're learning,,and they're doing all this stuff.,I went fucking ballistic, right? I went nuts.,You can probably remember Tiburon, it used to look like this. 
 After four hours of this, I stood up, and I took this team apart.,I screamed at them, I yelled at them, "What the hell are you doing?,You're letting me down, you're my designers,,you're supposed to be the creative ones,,what the hell is going on around here?",It was probably one of my better tirades, I have some good ones,,but this was probably one of my better ones. And I went into these people;,how could they take BMW's money,,how could they have a holiday for three months and produce nothing, nothing?,Because of course they didn't tell us that they had three station wagons,full of drawings, model concepts, pictures -- everything I wanted,,they'd locked up in the cars, because they had shown solidarity with the engineers --,and they'd decided not to show me anything,,in order to give the chance for problem solving a chance to start,,because they hadn't realized, of course,,that they couldn't do problem creating.,So we went to lunch -- 
 (Laughter) 
 And I've got to tell you, this was one seriously quiet lunch.,The engineers all sat at one end of the table,,the designers and I sat at the other end of the table, really quiet.,And I was just fucking furious, furious. OK?,Probably because they had all the fun and I didn't, you know.,That's what you get furious about right?,And somebody asked me about Catherine, my wife, you know,,did she fly out with me or something?,I said, "No," and it triggered a set of thoughts about my wife.,And I recalled that when Catherine and I were married,,the priest gave a very nice sermon, and he said something very important.,He said, "Love is not selfish," he said,,"Love does not mean counting how many times I say, 'I love you.',It doesn't mean you had sex this many times this month,,and it's two times less than last month,,so that means you don't love me as much.,Love is not selfish." And I thought about this, and I thought,,"You know, I'm not showing love here. I'm seriously not showing love.,I'm in the air, I'm in the air without trust.,This cannot be. This cannot be that I'm expecting a certain number of sketches,,and to me that's my quantification method for qualifying a team.,This cannot be." 
 So I told them this story. I said, "Guys, I'm thinking about something here,,this isn't right. I can't have a relationship with you guys,based on a premise that is a quantifiable one.,Based on a dictate premise that says, 'I'm a boss, you do what I say, without trust.'",I said "This can't be.",Actually, we all broke down into tears, to be quite honest about it,,because they still could not tell me how much frustration they had built up,inside of them, not being able to show me what I wanted,,and merely having to ask me to trust them that it would come.,And I think we felt much closer that day,,we cut a lot of strings that didn't need to be there,,and we forged the concept for what real team and creativity is all about.,We put the car back at the center of our thoughts, and we put love,,I think, truly back into the center of the process. 
 By the way, that team went on to create six different concepts,for the next model of what would be the proposal,for the next generation after SUVs in America.,One of those was the idea of a crossover coupes --,you see it downstairs, the X Coupe -- they had a lot of fun with that.,It was the rendition of our motorcycle,,the GS, as Carl Magnusson says, "brute-iful,",as the idea of what could be a motorcycle, if you add two more wheels.,And so, in conclusion, my lesson that I wanted to pass on to you,,was this one here. I'm also going to steal a little quote out of "Little Prince.",There's a lot to be said about trust and love,,if you know that those two words are synonymous for design.,I had a very, very meaningful relationship with my team that day,,and it's stayed that way ever since.,And I hope that you too find that there's more to design,,and more towards the art of the design, than doing it yourself.,It's true that the trust and the love, that makes it worthwhile. 
 Thanks so much. 
 (Applause)I was asked by Wilsonart International,,a plastic laminate company, which is,the largest plastic laminate company in the world --,they asked me to design,a trade show booth,for exhibition at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair,in New York, in 2000. 
 So looking at their three main markets,for their product which were basically,transportation design,,interiors and furniture,,we came up with the solution of taking,an old Airstream trailer and gutting it,,and trying to portray laminate,,and a trailer, in kind of a,fresh, new contemporary look.,When this trailer showed up at my shop,in Berkeley, I'd actually never stepped foot in,an Airstream trailer, or any other trailer.,So I can be somebody that can look at this,in a totally fresh perspective and see if I can,optimize it in its most idealistic fashion.,I decided I had to do some research,and really figure out what had gone wrong,somewhere along the history of Airstream.,What I discovered in these interiors is that,there was a disconnect between the exterior shell,and the interior architecture of the pieces.,In that the shell was originally conceived,as a lightweight, modern, futuristic,,high-tech pod for hurtling down the freeway, and,the interiors were completely out of sync with that.,In fact it appeared like they,referenced a mountain cabin. 
 That seemed really like a crisis to me,,that they had never been able to,develop a vocabulary,about escape, and about travel, and modernity,in this trailer that was consistent with the shell.,We really needed to do some archeology,in the trailer itself to figure out what's authentic,in an Airstream trailer,,and what feels like it has true purpose and utility.,We stripped out all the vinyl,and zolatone paint that was covering up,this just fantastic aluminum shell.,We took off all the visible hardware and trim,that was kind of doing the country cabin thing.,I literally drew on the walls of the trailer,,mocked it up in cardboard,,we'd come in and cut, decide things were wrong,,pull it out, put it back in. 
 The main goal was to smooth out the interior,,and begin to speak about motion,,and mobility, and independence.,The biggest difficulty on one of these trailers,is that when you're designing there's actually no,logical place to stop and start materials,because of the continuous form of the trailer.,There's no such things as two walls and a ceiling,coming together, where you can change materials and shapes.,So that became a challenge.,Compounding that,,the material of choice, laminate,,that I was trying to highlight,,only bends in two dimensions.,It's a compound curve interior.,What I had to devise was,a way of fooling the eye,into believing that all these panels,are curved with the shell. 
 What I came up with was,a series of second skins,that basically float over the aluminum shell.,And what I was trying to do there was,direct your eye in the space,,so that you would perceive the geometry in a different way,,and that the casework wouldn't break up the space.,They also gave us a way to run power,and rewire the trailer without tearing out the skin,,so they function as an electrical chase.,That's the trailer, pretty much finished. 
 That trailer led to another commission,,to participate in whats called Tokyo Designers Block.,Its a week of furniture design events in Tokyo, in October.,Teruo Kurosaki, who owns a furniture company called Idee,,he asked me to ship him two trailers to Tokyo.,He said one he would like to,make a real trailer, functioning, and we would sell that one.,Trailer number two, you have a blank slate, you can to anything you want. 
 We came up with a fantasy scenario,of a DJ traveling around the States,,that would collect records and go on tours.,This trailer housed two turntables,,mixer, wet bar, fridge, integrated sound system.,It's got a huge couch, fits quite a few people,,and basically we'd had a great time with this.,And so in this trailer I took it upon myself to think about travel,,and escape, in an idiosyncratic sense.,A lot of these ideas migrated into,the production trailers for Airstream. 
 This brings us up to the time that I started consulting to Airstream.,They came to me and said,,"Well, what can we do to freshen this thing up?,And do you think kids, you know, skateboarders, surfers,,rock climbers, would use these things?",And I said, "Well, not in that interior.",(Laughter),Anyway, I went out to Airstream,about six times during the process of building this prototype,,and it's called the Bambi prototype.,I thought, "Finally, oh yeah great,,big company, I'm gonna work with somebody with money,for tooling and molding.",And I walked in their prototype facility, and,it's exactly like my shop, only bigger --,same tools, same things.,So the problem became -- and they set this dilemma to me --,that you have to design the interior using only our existing technology,,and there's no money for tooling or molding.,The trailers themselves are actually hand-built.,All the casework is hand-scribed in, uniquely,,so you can't just cut 100 parts for 100 trailers,,you have to cut them big, and every single one is hand-fit.,They didn't want to go to a componentized system.,And there it is, that's the Bambi 16.,(Applause)How many Creationists do we have in the room?,Probably none. I think we're all Darwinians.,And yet many Darwinians are anxious, a little uneasy --,would like to see some limits on just how far the Darwinism goes.,It's all right.,You know spiderwebs? Sure, they are products of evolution.,The World Wide Web? Not so sure.,Beaver dams, yes. Hoover Dam, no.,What do they think it is that prevents the products of human ingenuity,from being themselves, fruits of the tree of life,,and hence, in some sense, obeying evolutionary rules?,And yet people are interestingly resistant,to the idea of applying evolutionary thinking to thinking -- to our thinking. 
 And so I'm going to talk a little bit about that,,keeping in mind that we have a lot on the program here.,So you're out in the woods, or you're out in the pasture,,and you see this ant crawling up this blade of grass.,It climbs up to the top, and it falls,,and it climbs, and it falls, and it climbs --,trying to stay at the very top of the blade of grass.,What is this ant doing? What is this in aid of?,What goals is this ant trying to achieve by climbing this blade of grass?,What's in it for the ant?,And the answer is: nothing. There's nothing in it for the ant.,Well then, why is it doing this?,Is it just a fluke?,Yeah, it's just a fluke. It's a lancet fluke.,It's a little brain worm.,It's a parasitic brain worm that has to get into the stomach of a sheep or a cow,in order to continue its life cycle.,Salmon swim upstream to get to their spawning grounds,,and lancet flukes commandeer a passing ant,,crawl into its brain, and drive it up a blade of grass like an all-terrain vehicle.,So there's nothing in it for the ant.,The ant's brain has been hijacked by a parasite that infects the brain,,inducing suicidal behavior.,Pretty scary. 
 Well, does anything like that happen with human beings?,This is all on behalf of a cause other than one's own genetic fitness, of course.,Well, it may already have occurred to you,that Islam means "surrender," or "submission of self-interest to the will of Allah.",Well, it's ideas -- not worms -- that hijack our brains.,Now, am I saying that a sizable minority of the world's population,has had their brain hijacked by parasitic ideas?,No, it's worse than that.,Most people have.,(Laughter),There are a lot of ideas to die for.,Freedom, if you're from New Hampshire.,(Laughter),Justice. Truth. Communism.,Many people have laid down their lives for communism,,and many have laid down their lives for capitalism.,And many for Catholicism. And many for Islam.,These are just a few of the ideas that are to die for.,They're infectious. 
 Yesterday, Amory Lovins spoke about "infectious repititis.",It was a term of abuse, in effect.,This is unthinking engineering.,Well, most of the cultural spread that goes on,is not brilliant, new, out-of-the-box thinking.,It's "infectious repetitis,",and we might as well try to have a theory of what's going on when that happens,so that we can understand the conditions of infection.,Hosts work hard to spread these ideas to others.,I myself am a philosopher, and one of our occupational hazards,is that people ask us what the meaning of life is.,And you have to have a bumper sticker,,you know. You have to have a statement.,So, this is mine. 
 The secret of happiness is: Find something more important than you are,and dedicate your life to it.,Most of us -- now that the "Me Decade" is well in the past --,now we actually do this.,One set of ideas or another,have simply replaced our biological imperatives in our own lives.,This is what our summum bonum is.,It's not maximizing the number of grandchildren we have.,Now, this is a profound biological effect.,It's the subordination of genetic interest to other interests.,And no other species does anything at all like it. 
 Well, how are we going to think about this?,It is, on the one hand, a biological effect, and a very large one.,Unmistakable.,Now, what theories do we want to use to look at this?,Well, many theories. But how could something tie them together?,The idea of replicating ideas;,ideas that replicate by passing from brain to brain.,Richard Dawkins, whom you'll be hearing later in the day, invented the term "memes,",and put forward the first really clear and vivid version of this idea,in his book "The Selfish Gene.",Now here am I talking about his idea.,Well, you see, it's not his. Yes -- he started it.,But it's everybody's idea now.,And he's not responsible for what I say about memes.,I'm responsible for what I say about memes. 
 Actually, I think we're all responsible,for not just the intended effects of our ideas,,but for their likely misuses.,So it is important, I think, to Richard, and to me,,that these ideas not be abused and misused.,They're very easy to misuse. That's why they're dangerous.,And it's just about a full-time job,trying to prevent people who are scared of these ideas,from caricaturing them and then running off to one dire purpose or another.,So we have to keep plugging away,,trying to correct the misapprehensions,so that only the benign and useful variants of our ideas continue to spread.,But it is a problem.,We don't have much time, and I'm going to go over just a little bit of this and cut out,,because there's a lot of other things that are going to be said. 
 So let me just point out: memes are like viruses.,That's what Richard said, back in '93.,And you might think, "Well, how can that be?,I mean, a virus is -- you know, it's stuff! What's a meme made of?",Yesterday, Negroponte was talking about viral telecommunications,but -- what's a virus?,A virus is a string of nucleic acid with attitude.,(Laughter),That is, there is something about it,that tends to make it replicate better than the competition does.,And that's what a meme is. It's an information packet with attitude.,What's a meme made of? What are bits made of, Mom?,Not silicon.,They're made of information, and can be carried in any physical medium.,What's a word made of?,Sometimes when people say, "Do memes exist?",I say, "Well, do words exist? Are they in your ontology?",If they are, words are memes that can be pronounced. 
 Then there's all the other memes that can't be pronounced.,There are different species of memes.,Remember the Shakers? Gift to be simple?,Simple, beautiful furniture?,And, of course, they're basically extinct now.,And one of the reasons is that among the creed of Shaker-dom,is that one should be celibate.,Not just the priests. Everybody.,Well, it's not so surprising that they've gone extinct. (Laughter),But in fact that's not why they went extinct.,They survived as long as they did,at a time when the social safety nets weren't there.,And there were lots of widows and orphans,,people like that, who needed a foster home.,And so they had a ready supply of converts.,And they could keep it going.,And, in principle, it could've gone on forever,,with perfect celibacy on the part of the hosts.,The idea being passed on through proselytizing,,instead of through the gene line. 
 So the ideas can live on in spite of the fact,that they're not being passed on genetically.,A meme can flourish in spite of having a negative impact on genetic fitness.,After all, the meme for Shaker-dom was essentially a sterilizing parasite.,There are other parasites that do this -- which render the host sterile.,It's part of their plan.,They don't have to have minds to have a plan. 
 I'm just going to draw your attention to just one,of the many implications of the memetic perspective, which I recommend.,I've not time to go into more of it.,In Jared Diamond's wonderful book, "Guns, Germs and Steel,",he talks about how it was germs, more than guns and steel,,that conquered the new hemisphere -- the Western hemisphere --,that conquered the rest of the world.,When European explorers and travelers spread out,,they brought with them the germs,that they had become essentially immune to,,that they had learned how to tolerate over,hundreds and hundreds of years, thousands of years,,of living with domesticated animals who were the sources of those pathogens.,And they just wiped out -- these pathogens just wiped out the native people,,who had no immunity to them at all. 
 And we're doing it again.,We're doing it this time with toxic ideas.,Yesterday, a number of people -- Nicholas Negroponte and others --,spoke about all the wonderful things,that are happening when our ideas get spread out,,thanks to all the new technology all over the world.,And I agree. It is largely wonderful. Largely wonderful.,But among all those ideas that inevitably flow out into the whole world,thanks to our technology, are a lot of toxic ideas.,Now, this has been realized for some time.,Sayyid Qutb is one of the founding fathers of fanatical Islam,,one of the ideologues that inspired Osama bin Laden.,"One has only to glance at its press films, fashion shows, beauty contests,,ballrooms, wine bars and broadcasting stations." Memes. 
 These memes are spreading around the world,and they are wiping out whole cultures.,They are wiping out languages.,They are wiping out traditions and practices.,And it's not our fault, anymore than it's our fault when our germs lay waste,to people that haven't developed the immunity.,We have an immunity to all of the junk that lies around the edges of our culture.,We're a free society, so we let pornography and all these things -- we shrug them off.,They're like a mild cold.,They're not a big deal for us.,But we should recognize that for many people in the world,,they are a big deal.,And we should be very alert to this.,As we spread our education and our technology,,one of the things that we are doing is we're the vectors of memes,that are correctly viewed by the hosts of many other memes,as a dire threat to their favorite memes --,the memes that they are prepared to die for. 
 Well now, how are we going to tell the good memes from the bad memes?,That is not the job of the science of memetics.,Memetics is morally neutral. And so it should be.,This is not the place for hate and anger.,If you've had a friend who's died of AIDS, then you hate HIV.,But the way to deal with that is to do science,,and understand how it spreads and why in a morally neutral perspective. 
 Get the facts.,Work out the implications.,There's plenty of room for moral passion once we've got the facts,and can figure out the best thing to do.,And, as with germs, the trick is not to try to annihilate them.,You will never annihilate the germs.,What you can do, however, is foster public health measures and the like,that will encourage the evolution of avirulence.,That will encourage the spread of relatively benign mutations,of the most toxic varieties.,That's all the time I have,,so thank you very much for your attention.There's a lot of exciting things happening in the design world,and at IDEO this past year,,and I'm pleased to get a chance to share some of those with you. 
 I didn't attend the first TED back in 1984,but I've been to a lot of them since that time.,I thought it [would] kind of be interesting to think back to that time,when Richard got the whole thing started. Thank you very much, Richard;,it's been a big, enjoyable part of my life, coming here. 
 And so thinking back, I was thinking,those of us in Silicon Valley were really focused on products or objects --,certainly technological objects.,And so it was great fun in those days, and some of those of you,who are in the audience were my clients.,We'd come in with some prototype underneath a black cloth,and we'd put it on the conference table,,and we'd pull off the black cloth and everybody would "ooh" and "ah.",That was a really good time. 
 And so we'll continue to focus on products, as we always have.,And if you were here last year,,I probably wrestled you to the floor and tried to show you my new EyeModule 2,,which was a camera that plugged into the Handspring.,And I took a lot of pictures last year;,very few people knew what I was up to, but I took a lot of pictures.,This year -- maybe you could show the slides --,this year we're carrying this Treo, which we had a lot to do with,and helped Handspring design it.,Also, though we designed it a few years ago --,it's just become ubiquitous in the last year or so --,this Heartstream defibrillator which is saving lives.,Maybe you've seen them in the airports? They seem to be everywhere now.,Lots of lives are being saved by those.,And, we're just about to announce the Zinio Reader product,that I believe will make magazines even more enjoyable to read.,So, we really will continue to focus on products. 
 But something's happened in the last 18 years since Richard started TED,,and that's that people like us --,I know people in other places have caught onto this for a long time,,but for us, we've really just started ... we've kind of,climbed Maslow's hierarchy a little bit --,and so we're now focused more and more on human-centered design,,human-centeredness in an approach to design.,That really involves designing behaviors and personality into products.,And I think you're starting to see that,,and it's making our job even more enjoyable. 
 Interestingly enough, we used to primarily build 3-D models --,you know, you've seen some today -- and 3-D renderings.,Then we'd go and we'd show those as communicating our ideas.,But firms like ours are having to move to a point where,we get those objects that we're designing and get them in motion,,showing how they'll be used.,And so in order to do that we've been forming,internal video-production groups,in order to make these kind of experience prototypes,that show just what we mean about the man-machine relationship.,And it's a much better way to see.,It's kind of like architects who show people in their houses,,as opposed to them being empty. 
 So I thought that I would show you a few videos,to show off this new, broader definition,of design in products and services and environments.,I have a few of them -- they're no more than a minute,or a minute-and-a-half apiece --,but I thought you might be interested in seeing some of our,work over the last year, and how it responds in video. 
 So, Prada New York: we were asked by Rem Koolhaas,and OMA to help us conceive the technology,that's in their retail store in New York.,He wanted a new kind of store -- a new one --,a store that had a cultural role as well as a retail one.,And that meant actually designing custom technology,as opposed to just buying things off the shelf and putting them to use. 
 So, there're lots of things. Everything has RF tags:,there's RF tags on the user, on the cards,,there's the staff devices that are all around the store.,You pick them up, and once you see something that you're interested in,,the staff person can scan them in,and then they can be shown on any screen throughout the store.,You can look at color, and sizes, and how it appeared on the runway, or whatever.,And so then the object -- the merchandise that you're interested in --,can be scanned. It's taken into the dressing room,,and in the dressing room there are scanners,so that we know exactly what clothing you have in the dressing room.,We can put that up on a touch screen,and you can play with that, and get more information,about the clothing that you're interested in as you're trying it on.,It's been used a lot of places, but I particularly like the use here,of liquid crystal displays in the changing room. 
 The last time I went to see this store,,there was a huge buzz about people standing outside and wondering,,"Am I going to actually get to see the people changing clothes here?",But if you push the button, of course, the whole wall goes dark.,So you can try to get approval, or not, for whatever you're wearing.,And then one of my favorite features of the technology,is the magic mirror, where you put on the clothes.,There's a big display in the mirror, and you can turn around --,but there's a three second delay.,So you can see what you look like from the back or all the way around, as you look.,(Applause) 
 About a year and a half ago we were asked to design,an installation in the museum --,this is a new wing of the Science Museum in London,,and it's primarily about digital and biomedical issues.,And a group at Itch, which is now part of IDEO,,designed this interactive wall that's about four stories tall.,I don't know if anybody's seen this --,it's pretty spectacular in the room. 
 Anyway, it's based on the London subway system.,And so you can see that,the goal is to bring some of the feedback,that the people who had gone to the museum were giving,,and get it up on the wall so everybody could see. Just for everybody to see.,So you enter your information. Then, like the London tube system,,the little trains go around with what you're thinking about.,And then when you get to a station, it's expanded so that you can actually read it. 
 Then when you exit the IMAX theatre on the fourth floor --,mostly teenagers coming out of there --,there's this big open space that has these tables in it,that have interactive games which are quite fun,,also designed by Durrell [Bishop] and Andrew [Hirniak] of Itch.,And the topics include things that the museum is about:,male fertility, choosing the sex of your baby,or what a driverless car might be like.,There's lots of room, so people can come up,and understand what it is before they get involved. 
 And also, it's not shown in the video, but these are very beautiful.,They go to the top of the wall and when they reach all the way to the top,,after they've bounced around, they disperse into bits,and go off into the atmosphere. 
 The next video is not done by us.,This is CBS Sunday Morning that aired about two weeks ago.,Scott Adams ran into us,and asked us if we wouldn't help to design,the ultimate cubicle for Dilbert,,which sounded like a fun thing and so we couldn't pass it up.,He's always been interested in technology in the future. 
 (Video: Scott Adams: I realized that at some point I might be,the world's expert on what's wrong with cubicles.,So we thought, well, wouldn't it be fun to get together,with some of the smartest design guys in the world,and try to figure out if we could make the cubicle better? 
 Narrator: Though they work in a wide-open office space,spectacularly set under San Francisco's Oakland Bay Bridge,,the team built their own little cubicles,to fully experience the problems. 
 Woman: A one-way mirror. I can look out; you can look at yourself. 
 Narrator: They took pictures. 
 Woman: You feel so trapped, when someone kind of leans over,and you're sort of held captive there for a minute. 
 SA: So far it's chaos, but a lot of people are doing stuff, so that's good.,We'll see what happens. 
 Narrator: The first group builds a cubicle in which the walls are screens,for the computer and for family photos.,In the second group's scenario, the walls are alive,and actually give Dilbert a group hug.,(Laughter),Behind the humor is the idea of making the cubicle more human.) 
 David Kelley: So here's the final thing, complete with orange lighting,that follows the sun across -- that follows the tracks of the sun -- across the sky.,So you feel that in your cubicle.,And my favorite feature, which is a flower in a vase,that wilts when you leave in disappointment,,and then when you come back, it comes up to greet you, happy to see you. 
 (SA: The storage is built right into the wall.) 
 DK: You know, it has homey touches like a built-in fish tank in the walls,,or something to be aggressive with to release tension. 
 (SA: Customizable for the boss of your choice.) 
 DK: And of course: a hammock for your afternoon nap,that stretches across your cubicle. 
 (SA: Life would be sweet in a cubicle like this.) 
 DK: This next project, we were asked to design a pavilion to celebrate,the recycling of the water on the Millennium Dome in London.,The dome has an incredible amount of water that washes off of it,,as well as wastewater.,So this building actually celebrates the water,as it comes out of the recycling plant and goes into the reed bed,so that it can be filtered for the final time. 
 The pavilion's design goal was to be kind of quiet and peaceful.,In contrast to if you went inside the dome, where it's,kind of wild and crazy and everybody's,learning all kinds of things, or fooling around, or whatever they're doing.,But it was intended to be quite quiet.,And then you would wander around and gather information,,in a straightforward fashion, about the recycling process,and what's being done, and how they're going to reuse the water,once it comes through the plant.,And then, if you saw,,the panels actually rotate. So you can get the information,on the front side, but as they rotate, you can see the actual,recycling plant behind, with all the machines as they actually process the water.,You can see: there's the plant.,These are all very low-budget videos, like quick prototypes. 
 And we're announcing a new product here tonight,,which is the first time this has ever been shown in public.,It's called Spyfish, and it's a company called H2Eye,,started by Nigel Jagger in London.,And it's a company that's trying to bring the experience -- many people have boats,,or enjoy being on boats, but a very small percentage of people,actually have the capability or the interest in going under the water,and actually seeing what's there,,and enjoying what scuba divers do.,This product, it has two cameras.,You throw it over the side of your boat,and you basically scuba dive without getting wet. 
 For us -- there's the object -- for us, it was two projects. One, to design the interface,so that the interface doesn't get in your way.,You could have that kind of immersive experience of being underwater --,of feeling like you're underwater -- seeing what's going on.,And the other one was to design the object,and make sure that it was a consumer product and not a research tool.,And so we spent a lot of time -- this has been going on for about,seven or eight years, this project --,and [we're] just ready to start building them. 
 (Narrator: The Spyfish is a revolutionary subaquatic video camera.,It can dive to 500 feet, to where sunlight does not penetrate,,and is equipped with powerful lights.,It becomes your eyes and ears as you venture into the deep.,The battery-powered Spyfish sends the live video-feed through a slender cable.) 
 DK: This slender cable was a huge technological advancement,and it allowed the whole thing to be the size that it is. 
 (Narrator: And this central box connects the whole system together.,Maneuvering the Spyfish is simple with the wireless remote control.,You watch the video with superimposed graphics,that indicate your depth and compass heading.,The fluid graphics and ambient sounds combine,to help you completely lose yourself underwater.),(Applause) 
 DK: And the last thing I'll talk about is ApproTEC,,which is a project that I'm very excited about.,ApproTEC is a company started by Dr. Martin Fisher,,who's a good friend of mine. He's a Ph.D. from Stanford.,He found himself in Kenya on a Fulbright,and he had a very interesting insight, which is that,he said, "There must be entrepreneurs in Kenya;,there must be entrepreneurs everywhere.",And he noticed that for weddings and funerals there,they could find enough money to put something together.,So he decided to start manufacturing products in Kenya,with Kenyan manufacturers -- designed by people like us, but taken there.,And to this date -- he's been gone for only a few years --,he's started 19,000 companies.,He's made 30,000 new jobs.,And just the sales of the products -- this is a non-profit --,the sales of these products is now .6\% of the GDP of Kenya.,This is one guy doing this. This is a pretty spectacular thing. 
 So we're in the process of helping them design,deep-well, low-cost manual pumps,in order for these people who have a quarter acre of land,to be able to grow crops in the off-season.,What they do now is: they can grow crops in the rainy season,but they can't grow them in the off-season.,And so by doing that, the woman that you saw in the first thing --,she's a school teacher -- always wanted to send her kids to college,and she's going to be able to do it because of these things.,So with seed-squeezers, and pumps, and hay-balers and,very straightforward things that we're designing --,my students are doing this as class projects,and IDEO has donated their time to do this kind of work --,it's really amazing to see his success, Martin's. 
 We also were thinking about the experience of Richard,,and so --,(Laughter),-- we designed this hat, because I knew I'd be the last one in the day,and I needed to deal with him. So I just have one more thing to say.,(Laughter),Can you read it?,(Laughter),Well, it's always kind of funny when he comes up and hovers.,You know, you don't want to be rude to him and you don't want to feel guilty,,and so I thought this would do it, where I just sit here.,(Laughter),(Applause) 
 So we saw a lot of interesting things being designed today in this session,,and from all the different presenters.,And in my own practice, from product to ApproTEC,,it's really exciting that we're taking a more human-centered approach to design,,that we're including behaviors and personalities in the things we do,,and I think this is great.,Designers are more trusted and more integrated,into the business strategy of companies,,and I have to say, for one, I feel very lucky at the progress that design,has made since the first TED. Thanks a lot.I draw to better understand things.,Sometimes I make a lot of drawings,and I still don't understand what it is I'm drawing.,Those of you who are comfortable with digital stuff,and even smug about that relationship might be amused to know,that the guy who is best known for "The Way Things Work,",while preparing for part of a panel for called Understanding,,spent two days trying to get his laptop to communicate with his new CD burner.,Who knew about extension managers?,I've always managed my own extensions,so it never even occurred to me to read the instructions,,but I did finally figure it out. I had to figure it out,,because along with the invitation,came the frightening reminder that there would be no projector,,so bringing those carousels would no longer be necessary,but some alternate form of communication would. 
 Now, I could talk about something that I'm known for,,something that would be particularly appropriate,for many of the more technically minded people here,,or I could talk about something I really care about.,I decided to go with the latter.,I'm going to talk about Rome.,Now, why would I care about Rome, particularly?,Well, I went to Rhode Island School of Design,in the second half of the '60s to study architecture.,I was lucky enough to spend my last year, my fifth year,,in Rome as a student. It changed my life.,Not the least reason was the fact that I had spent those first four years living at home,,driving into RISD everyday, driving back.,I missed the '60s. I read about them; (Laughter),I understand they were pretty interesting. I missed them,,but I did spend that extraordinary year in Rome,,and it's a place that is never far from my mind.,So, whenever given an opportunity,,I try to do something in it or with it or for it. 
 I also make drawings to help people understand things.,Things that I want them to believe I understand.,And that's what I do as an illustrator,,that's my job.,So, I'm going to show you some pictures of Rome.,I've made a lot of drawings of Rome over the years.,These are just drawings of Rome. I get back as often as possible --,I need to.,All different materials, all different styles, all different times,,drawings from sketchbooks looking at the details of Rome.,Part of the reason I'm showing you these,is that it sort of helps illustrate this process I go through,of trying to figure out what it is I feel about Rome and why I feel it. 
 These are sketches of some of the little details.,Rome is a city full of surprises.,I mean, we're talking about unusual perspectives,,we're talking about narrow little winding streets,that suddenly open into vast, sun-drenched piazzas --,never, though, piazzas that are not humanly scaled.,Part of the reason for that is the fact that they grew up organically.,That amazing juxtaposition of old and new,,the bits of light that come down between the buildings,that sort of create a map that's traveling above your head of,usually blue -- especially in the summer --,compared to the map that you would normally expect to see,of conventional streets. 
 And I began to think about how I could communicate this in book form.,How could I share my sense of Rome,,my understanding of Rome?,And I'm going to show you a bunch of dead ends, basically.,The primary reason for all these dead ends is when,if you're not quite sure where you're going, you're certainly not going to get there,with any kind of efficiency. 
 Here's a little map. And I thought of maps at the beginning;,maybe I should just try and do a little atlas,of my favorite streets and connections in Rome.,And here's a line of text that actually evolves,from the exhaust of a scooter zipping across the page.,Here that same line of text wraps around a fountain,in an illustration that can be turned upside down and read both ways.,Maybe that line of text could be a story,to help give some human aspect to this.,Maybe I should get away from this map completely,,and really be honest about wanting to show you my favorite bits and pieces of Rome,and simply kick a soccer ball in the air --,which happens in so many of the squares in the city --,and let it bounce off of things. And I'll simply explain,what each of those things is that the soccer ball hits.,That seemed like a sort of a cheap shot.,But even though I just started this presentation,,this is not the first thing that I tried to do,and I was getting sort of desperate. 
 Eventually, I realized that I had really no content that I could count on,,so I decided to move towards packaging. (Laughter),I mean, it seems to work for a lot of things.,So I thought a little box set of four small books might do the trick.,But one of the ideas that emerged,from some of those sketches was the notion of traveling through Rome,in different vehicles at different speeds in order,to show the different aspects of Rome.,Sort of an overview of Rome and the plan that you might see from a dirigible.,Quick snapshots of things you might see,from a speeding motor scooter, and very slow,walking through Rome, you might be able to study in more detail,some of the wonderful surfaces and whatnot that you come across. 
 Anyways, I went back to the dirigible notion.,Went to Alberto Santos-Dumont.,Found one of his dirigibles that had enough dimensions,so I could actually use it as a scale,that I would then juxtapose with some of the things in Rome.,This thing would be flying over or past,or be parked in front of, but it would be like having a ruler --,sort of travel through the pages without being a ruler.,Not that you know how long number 11 actually is,,but you would be able to compare number 11 against the Pantheon,with number 11 against the Baths of Caracalla,,and so on and so forth. If you were interested. 
 This is Beatrix. She has a dog named Ajax,,she has purchased a dirigible -- a small dirigible --,she's assembling the structure,,Ajax is sniffing for holes in the balloon before they set off.,She launches this thing above the Spanish Steps,and sets off for an aerial tour of the city.,Over the Spanish Steps we go.,A nice way to show that river, that stream sort of pouring down the hill.,Unfortunately, just across the road from it,or quite close by is the Column of Marcus Aurelius,,and the diameter of the dirigible makes an impression,,as you can see, as she starts trying to read the story that spirals around,the Column of Marcus Aurelius -- gets a little too close, nudges it.,This gives me a chance to suggest to you the structure,of the Column of Marcus Aurelius,,which is really no more than a pile of quarters,high -- thick quarters. Over the Piazza of Saint Ignacio,,completely ruining the symmetry, but that aside,a spectacular place to visit.,A spectacular framework, inside of which you see, usually,,extraordinary blue sky.,Over the Pantheon and the 26-foot diameter Oculus.,She parks her dirigible, lowers the anchor rope,and climbs down for a closer look inside.,The text here is right side and upside down so that you are forced,to turn the book around, and you can see it from ground point of view,and from her point of view -- looking in the hole,,getting a different kind of perspective,,moving you around the space. Particularly appropriate in a building,that can contain perfectly a sphere,dimensions of the diameter being the same,as the distance from the center of the floor to the center of the Oculus. 
 Unfortunately for her, the anchor line gets tangled,around the feet of some Boy Scouts who are visiting the Pantheon,,and they are immediately yanked out,and given an extraordinary but terrifying tour,of some of the domes of Rome, which would,,from their point of view, naturally be hanging upside down.,They bail out as soon as they get to the top of Saint Ivo,,that little spiral structure you see there.,She continues on her way over Piazza Navona.,Notices a lot of activity at the Tre Scalini restaurant,,is reminded that it is lunchtime and she's hungry.,They keep on motoring towards the Campo de' Fiori,,which they soon reach. Ajax the dog is put in a basket,and lowered with a list of food into the marketplace,,which flourishes there until about one in the afternoon,,and then is completely removed,and doesn't appear again until six or seven the following morning.,Anyway, the pooch gets back to the dirigible with the stuff.,Unfortunately, when she goes to unwrap the prosciutto,,Ajax makes a lunge for it.,She's managed to save the prosciutto,,but in the process she loses the tablecloth,,which you can see flying away in the upper left-hand corner.,They continue without their tablecloth,,looking for a place to land this thing so that they can actually have lunch.,They eventually discover a huge wall,that's filled with small holes, ideal for docking a dirigible,because you've got a place to tie up.,Turns out to be the exterior wall --,that part of it that remains -- of the Coliseum,,so they park themselves there and have a terrific lunch,and have a spectacular view. 
 At the end of lunch, they untie the anchor, they set off,through the Baths of Caracalla and over the walls of the city,and then an abandoned gatehouse,and decide to take one more look at the Pyramid of Cestius,,which has this lightning rod on top.,Unfortunately, that's a problem: they get a little too close,,and when you're in a dirigible,you have to be very careful about spikes.,So that sort of brings her little story to a conclusion.,Marcello, on the other hand, is sort of a lazy guy,,but he's not due at work until about noon.,So, the alarm goes off and it's five to 12 or so.,He gets up, leaps onto his scooter, races through the city,past the church of Santa Maria della Pace,,down the alleys, through the streets,that tourists may be wandering through,,disturbing the quiet backstreet life of Rome at every turn.,That speed with which he is moving, I hope I have suggested in this little image,,which, again, can be turned around and read from both sides,because there's text on the bottom and text on the top,,one of which is upside down in this image. 
 So, he keeps on moving, approaching an unsuspecting waiter,who is trying to deliver two plates of linguine,in a delicate white wine clam sauce,to diners who are sitting at a table just outside of a restaurant in the street.,Waiter catches on, but it's too late.,And Marcello keeps moving in his scooter.,Everything he sees from this point on is slightly affected by the linguine,,but keeps on moving because this guy's got a job to do.,Removes some scaffolding. One of the reasons,Rome remains the extraordinary place it is that,because of scaffolding and the determination,to maintain the fabric, it is a city that continues,to grow and adapt to the needs of the particular time,in which it finds itself, or we find it.,Right through the Piazza della Rotonda,,in front of the Pantheon -- again wreaking havoc -- and finally getting to work.,Marcello, as it turns out,,is the driver of the number 64 bus,,and if you've been on the number 64 bus, you know,that it's driven with the same kind of exuberance,as Marcello demonstrated on his scooter. 
 And finally Carletto. You see his apartment in the upper left-hand corner.,He's looking at his table;,he's planning to propose this evening to his girlfriend of 40 years, (Laughter),and he wants it to be perfect.,He's got candles out, he's got flowers in the middle,and he's trying to figure out where to put the plates and the glasses.,But he's not happy; something's wrong.,The phone rings anyway, he's called to the palazzo.,He saunters -- he saunters at a good clip,,but as compared to all the traveling we've just seen, he's sauntering.,Everybody knows Carletto, because he's in entertainment,,actually; he's in television.,He's actually in television repair, which is why people know him.,So they all have his number.,He arrives at the palazzo, arrives at the big front door.,Enters the courtyard and talks to the custodian,,who tells him that there's been a disaster in the palazzo;,nobody's TVs are working,and there's a big soccer game coming up,,and the crowd is getting a little restless and a little nervous. 
 He goes down to the basement and starts to check the wiring,,and then gradually works his way up to the top of the building,,apartment by apartment, checking every television,,checking every connection,,hoping to find out what this problem is.,He works his way up, finally, the grand staircase,and then a smaller staircase until he reaches the attic.,He opens the window of the attic, of course, and there's a tablecloth,wrapped around the building's television antenna.,He removes it, the problems are solved,,everybody in the palazzo is happy.,And of course, he also solves his own problem.,All he has to do now, with a perfect table,,is wait for her to arrive. 
 That was the first attempt, but it didn't seem substantial enough,to convey whatever it was I wanted to convey about Rome.,So I thought, well, I'll just do piazzas,,and I'll get inside and underneath,and I'll show these things growing,and show why they're shaped the way they are and so on.,And then I thought, that's too complicated. No,,I'll just take my favorite bits and pieces,and I'll put them inside the Pantheon but keep the scale,,so you can see the top of Sant'Ivo and the Pyramid of Cestius,and the Tempietto of Bramante all side by side in this amazing space.,Now that's one drawing,,so I thought maybe it's time for Piranesi to meet Escher. (Laughter) 
 You see that I'm beginning to really lose control here,and also hope.,There's a very thin blue line of exhaust,that sort of runs through this thing that would be kind of the trail that holds it all together.,Then I thought, "Wait a minute, what am I doing?",A book is not only a neat way of collecting and storing information,,it's a series of layers.,I mean, you always peel one layer off another;,we think of them as pages, doing it a certain way.,But think of them as layers. I mean, Rome is a place of layers --,horizontal layers, vertical layers --,and I thought, well just peeling off a page would allow me to --,if I got you thinking about it the right way --,would allow me to sort of show you the depth of layers.,The stucco on the walls of most of the buildings in Rome,covers the scars; the scars of centuries of change,as these structures have been adapted,rather than being torn down.,If I do a foldout page on the left-hand side,and let you just unfold it, you see behind it what I mean by scar tissue.,You can see that in 1635,,it became essential to make smaller windows,because the bad guys were coming or whatever.,Adaptations all get buried under the stucco.,I could peel out a page of this palazzo to show you what's going on inside of it.,But more importantly, I could also show you,what it looks like at the corner of one of those magnificent buildings,with all the massive stone blocks,,or the fake stone blocks done with brick and stucco,,which is more often the case. 
 So it becomes slightly three-dimensional.,I could take you down one of those narrow little streets,into one of those surprising piazzas by using a double gate fold --,double foldout page -- which, if you were like me,reading a pop-up book as a child, you hopefully stick your head into.,You wrap the pages around your head,and are in that piazza for that brief period of time.,And I've really not done anything much more complicated,than make foldout pages.,But then I thought, maybe I could be simpler here.,Let's look at the Pantheon and the Piazza della Rotonda in front of it.,Here's a book completely wide open.,OK, if I don't open the book the whole way,,if I just open it 90 degrees, we're looking down the front of the Pantheon,,and we're looking sort of at the top, more or less down on the square.,And if I turn the book the other way,,we're looking across the square at the front of the Pantheon.,No foldouts, no tricks --,just a book that isn't open the whole way.,That seemed promising. I thought, maybe I'll do it inside,and I can even combine the foldouts with the only partially opened book.,So we get inside the Pantheon,and it grows and so on and so forth.,And I thought, maybe I'm on the right track,,but it sort of lost its human quality. 
 So I went back to the notion of story,,which is always a good thing to have if you're trying to get people,to pay attention to a book and pick up information along the way.,"Pigeon's Progress" struck me as a catchy title.,If it was a homing pigeon,,it would be called "Homer's Odyssey.",But it was the journey of the ... (Laughter),I mean, if a title works, use it. But it would be a journey that went through Rome,and showed all the things that I like about Rome.,It's a pigeon sitting on top of a church.,Goes off during the day and does normal pigeon stuff. Comes back,,the whole place is covered with scaffolding and green netting,and there's no way this pigeon can get home.,So it's a homeless pigeon now,and it's going to have to find another place to live,,and that allows me to go through my catalog of favorite things,,and we start with the tall ones and so on.,Maybe it has to go back and live with family members;,that's not always a good thing,,but it does sort of bring pigeons together again.,And I thought, that's sort of interesting,,but maybe there's a person who should be involved in this in some way. 
 So I kind of came up with this old guy,who spends his life looking after sick pigeons.,He'll go anywhere to get them -- dangerous places and whatnot --,and they become really friends with this guy,,and learn to do tricks for him and entertain him at lunchtime and stuff like that.,There's a real bond that develops,between this old man and these pigeons.,But unfortunately he gets sick. He gets really sick at the end of the story.,He's taught them to spell his name, which is Aldo.,They show up one day after three or four days of not seeing him --,he lives in this little garret --,and they spell his name and fly around.,And he finally gets enough strength together,to climb up the ladder onto the roof,,and all the pigeons, a la Red Balloon, are there waiting for him,and they carry him off over the walls of the city.,And I forgot to mention this:,whenever he lost a pigeon, he would take that pigeon,out beyond the walls of the city.,In the old Roman custom, the dead,were never buried within the walls.,And I thought that's a really cheery story.,(Laughter). That's really going to go a long way. 
 So anyway, I went through ... And again, if packaging doesn't work,and if the stories aren't going anywhere,,I just come up with titles,and hope that a title will sort of kick me off in the right direction.,And sometimes it does focus me enough,and I'll even do a title page.,So, these are all title pages that eventually led me,to the solution I settled on, which is the story of a young woman,who sends a message on a homing pigeon --,she lives outside the walls of the city of Rome -- to someone in the city.,And the pigeon is flying down above the Appian Way here.,You can see the tombs and pines and so on and so forth along the way.,If you see the red line,,you are seeing the trail of the pigeon;,if you don't see the red line, you are the pigeon.,And it becomes necessary and possible, at this point,,to try to convey what that sense would be like,of flying over the city without actually moving.,Past the Pyramid of Cestius --,these will seem very familiar to you, even if you haven't been to Rome recently --,past the gatehouse.,This is something that's a little bit unusual.,This pigeon does something that most homing pigeons do not do:,it takes the scenic route, (Laughter) which was a device,that I felt was necessary to actually extend this book,beyond about four pages. 
 So, we circle around the Coliseum, past the Church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin,and the Temple of Hercules towards the river.,We almost collide with the cornice of the Palazzo Farnese --,designed by Michelangelo,,built of stone taken from the Coliseum -- narrow escape.,We swoop down over the Campo de' Fiori.,This is one of those things I show to my students,because it's a complete bastardization --,a denial of any rules of perspective.,The only rule of perspective that I think matters is,if it looks believable, you've succeeded.,But you try and figure out where the vanishing points meet here;,a couple are on Mars and,a couple of others in Cremona.,But into the piazza in front of Santa Maria della Pace,,where invariably a soccer game is going on,,and we're hit by a soccer ball.,Now this is a terrible illustration of being hit by a soccer ball.,I have all the pieces:,there's Santa Maria della Pace, there's a soccer ball,,there's a little bit of a bird's wing -- nothing's happening,,so I had to rethink it.,And if you do want to see Santa Maria della Pace,,these books are really flexible, incredibly interactive --,just turn it around and look at it the other way. 
 Through the alley, we can see the impact is captured in the red line.,And then bird manages to pull itself together past this medieval tower --,one of the few remaining medieval towers --,towards the church of Sant'Agnese,and around the dome looking down into Piazza Navona --,which we've already mentioned and seen and flown over a couple of times;,there's the Bernini statue of the Four Rivers --,and then past the wonderful Borromini Sant'Ivo,,stopping just long enough on the 26-foot diameter Oculus,of the Pantheon to catch our breath.,And then we can swoop inside and around; and because we're flying,,we don't really have to worry about gravity at this particular moment in time,,so this drawing can be oriented in any way on the page. 
 We get a little exuberant as we pass Gesu;,it's not surprising to sort of mimic the architecture in this way.,Past the wonderful wall filled with the juxtaposition that I was talking about;,beautiful carvings set into the walls above the neon "Ristorante" sign, and so on.,And eventually, we arrive at the courtyard of the palazzo,,which is our destination.,Straight up through the courtyard,into a little window into the attic,,where somebody is working at the drawing board.,He removes the message from the leg of the bird; this is what it says.,As we look at the drawing board,,we see what he's working on is, in fact,,a map of the journey that the pigeon has just taken,,and the red line extends through all the sights.,And if you want the information, so that we complete this cycle of understanding,,all you have to do is read these paragraphs.,Thank you very much.Kurt Andersen: Like many architects, David is a hog for the limelight,but is sufficiently reticent -- or at least pretends to be --,that he asked me to question him rather than speaking.,In fact what we're going to talk about,,I think, is in fact a subject that is probably better served,by a conversation than an address.,And I guess we have a bit of news clip to precede. 
 Dan Rather: Since the September 11th attack on the World Trade Center,,many people have flocked to downtown New York to see,and pay respects at what amounts to the 16-acre burial ground.,Now, as CBS's Jim Axelrod reports, they're putting the finishing touches,on a new way for people to visit and view the scene. 
 Jim Axelrod: Forget the Empire State Building or the Statue of Liberty.,There's a new place in New York,where the crowds are thickest -- Ground Zero. 
 Tourist: I've taken my step-daughter here from Indianapolis.,This was -- out of all the tourist sites in New York City --,this was her number-one pick. 
 JA: Thousands now line up on lower Broadway. 
 Tourist: I've been wanting to come down here since this happened. 
 JA: Even on the coldest winter days.,To honor and remember. 
 Tourist: It's reality, it's us. It happened here.,This is ours. 
 JA: So many, in fact, that seeing has become,a bit of a problem. 
 Tourist: I think that people are very frustrated,that they're not able to get closer to see what's going on. 
 JA: But that is about to change.,In record time,,a team of architects and construction workers,designed and built a viewing platform to ease the frustration,and bring people closer. 
 Man: They'll get an incredible panorama,and understand, I think more completely,,the sheer totality of the destruction of the place. 
 JA: If you think about it, Ground Zero is unlike,most any other tourist site in America.,Unlike the Grand Canyon or the Washington Monument,,people come here to see what's no longer there. 
 David Rockwell: The first experience people will have here,when they see this is not as a construction site,but as this incredibly moving burial ground. 
 JA: The walls are bare by design, so people can fill them,with their own memorials the way they already have,along the current perimeter. 
 Tourist: From our hearts, it affected us just as much. 
 JA: The ramps are made of simple material --,the kind of plywood you see at construction sites --,which is really the whole point.,In the face of America's worst destruction,people are building again.,Jim Axelrod, CBS News, New York. 
 KA: This is not an obvious subject to be in the sensuality segment,,but certainly David you are known as -- I know, a phrase you hate --,an entertainment architect.,Your work is highly sensual, even hedonistic. 
 DR: I like that word. 
 KA: It's about pleasure -- casinos and hotels and restaurants.,How did the shock that all of us -- and especially all of us in New York --,felt on the 11th of September transmute,into your desire to do this thing? 
 DR: Well the truth of the matter is, post-September 11th,,I felt myself in the role originally --,first of all as someone who lives in Tribeca,and whose neighborhood was devastated,,and as someone who works less than a mile from there --,that I was in the role of forcing 100 people who work with me,in my firm, to continue to have the same level of enthusiasm,about creating the places we had been creating.,In fact we're finishing a book which is called "Pleasure,",which is about sensual pleasure in spaces. 
 But I've got to tell you -- it became impossible to do that.,We were really paralyzed.,And I found myself the Friday after September 11th --,two days afterwards --,literally unable to motivate anyone to do anything.,We gave the office a few days off. 
 And in discussing this with other architects,,we had seen people saying in the press,that they should rebuild the towers as they were --,they should rebuild them 50 stories taller.,And I thought it was astonishing to speculate,,as if this were a competition,,on something that was such a fresh wound.,And I had a series of discussions --,first with Rick Scofidio and Liz Diller, who collaborated with us on this,,and several other people --,and really felt like we had to find relevance in doing something.,And that as people who create places, the ultimate way to help,wasn't to pontificate or to make up scenarios,,but to help right now.,So we tried to come up with a way,,as a group, to have a kind of design SWAT team.,And that was the mission that we came up with. 
 KA: Were you conscious of suddenly --,as a designer whose work is all about fulfilling wants --,suddenly fulfilling needs? 
 DR: Well what I was aware of was,,there was this overwhelming need to act now.,And we were asked to participate in a few projects before this.,There was a school, PS 234, that had been evacuated down at Ground Zero.,They moved to an abandoned school.,We took about 20 or 30 architects and designers and artists,,and over four days -- it was like this urban barn-raising --,to renovate it, and everyone wanted to help.,It was just extraordinary.,Tom Otterness contributed, Maira Kalman contributed,and it became this cathartic experience for us. 
 KA: And that was done, effectively,,by October 8 or something? 
 DR: Yeah. 
 KA: Obviously, what you faced in trying to do something,as substantial as this project -- and this is only one of four,that you've designed to surround the site --,you must have run up against the incredibly byzantine,,entrenched bureaucracy and powers that be,in New York real estate and New York politics. 
 DR: Well, it's a funny thing.,We finished PS 234, and had dinner with a small group.,I was actually asked to be a committee chair on an AIA committee to rebuild.,And I sat in on several meetings.,And there were the most circuitous grand plans,that had to do with long-term infrastructure and rebuilding the entire city.,And the fact is that there were immediate wounds and needs that needed to be filled,,and there was talk about inclusion and wanting it to be an inclusive process.,And it wasn't an inclusive group.,So we said, what is -- 
 KA: It was not an inclusive group? 
 DR: It was not an inclusive group.,It was predominantly a white, rich, corporate group,that was not representative of the city. 
 KA: Shocking. 
 DR: Yeah, surprising.,So Rick and Liz and Kevin and I came up with the idea.,The city actually approached us.,We first approached the city about Pier 94.,We saw how PS 234 worked.,The families -- the victims of the families --,were going to this pier that was incredibly dehumanizing. 
 KA: On the Hudson River? 
 DR: Yeah. And the city actually -- through Tim Zagat initially,,and then through Christyne Nicholas, then we got to Giuliani --,said, "You know we don't want to do anything with Pier 94 right now,,but we have an observation platform for the families down at Ground Zero,that we'd like to be a more dignified experience for the families,,and a way to protect it from the weather." 
 So I went down there with Rick and Liz and Kevin,,and I've got to say, it was the most moving experience of my life.,It was devastating to see the simple plywood platform with a rail around it,,where the families of the victims had left notes to them.,And there was no mediation between us and the experience.,There was no filter. 
 And I remembered on September 11th, on 14th Street,,the roof of our building -- we can see the World Trade Towers prominently --,and I saw the first building collapse from a conference room,on the eighth floor on a TV that we had set up.,And then everyone was up on the roof, so I ran up there.,And it was amazing how much harder it was,to believe in real life than it was on TV.,There was something about the comfort of the filter,and how much information was between us and the experience.,So seeing this in a very simple,,dignified way was a very powerful experience. 
 So we went back to the city and said,we're not particularly interested in the upgrade of this as a VIP platform,,but we've spent some time down there.,At the same time the city had this need.,They were looking for a solution,to deal with 30 or 40 thousand people a day,who were going down there, that had nowhere to go.,And there was no way to deal with the traffic around the site.,So dealing with it is just an immediate master plan.,There was a way -- there had to be a way --,to get people to move around the site. 
 KA: But then you've got to figure out a way --,we will skip over the insanely tedious process of getting permits,and getting everybody on board -- but simply funding this thing.,It looks like a fairly simple thing,,but this was a half a million dollar project? 
 DR: Well, we knew that if it wasn't privately funded,,it wasn't going to happen.,And we also, frankly, knew that if it didn't happen,by the end of the Giuliani administration,,then everyone who we were dealing with at the DOT,and the Police Department and all of the --,we were meeting with 20 or 30 people with the city at a time,,and it was set up by the Office of Emergency Management.,This incredible act on their part, because they really wanted this,,and they sensed that this needed to happen. 
 KA: And there was therefore this ticking clock,,because Giuliani was obviously out three months after that. 
 DR: Yeah. So the first thing we had to do was find a way to get this --,we had to work with the families of the victims,,through the city, to make sure that they knew this was happening.,Because this didn't want to be a surprise.,And we also had to be as under the radar screen as we could be in New York,,because the key was not raising a lot of objection,and sort of working as quietly as possible. 
 We came up with the idea of setting up a foundation,,mainly because when we found a contractor who would build this,,he would not agree to do this, even if we would pay him the money.,There needed to be a foundation in place.,So we came up with a foundation, and actually what happened was,one major developer in New York -- 
 KA: Who shall remain nameless, I guess? 
 DR: Yeah. His initials are JS, and he owns Rockefeller Center,,if that helps anyone -- volunteered to help.,And we met with him.,The prices from the contractors were between five to 700,000 dollars.,And Atlantic-Heydt, who's the largest scaffolding contractor in the country,,volunteered to do it at cost.,So this developer said, "You know what, we'll underwrite the entire expense.",And we said, "That's incredible!" 
 And I think this was the 21st,,and we knew this had to be built and up by the 28th.,And we had to start construction the next day.,We had a meeting that evening with his contractor of choice,,and the contractor showed up with the drawings of the platform,about half the size that we had drawn it. 
 KA: Sort of like the Spinal Tap scene where you get,the tiny little Stonehenge, I guess?,(Laughter) 
 DR: In fact, it was as if this was going to be window-washing scaffolding.,There was no sense of the fact that this is next to Saint Paul --,that this is really a place that needs to be kind of dignified,,and a place to reflect and remember.,And I've got to say that we spent a lot of time,in putting this together, watching the crowds that gathered at Saint Paul --,which is just to the right -- and moving around the site.,And I live down there, so we spent a lot of time looking at the need. 
 And I think people were amazed at two things --,I think they were amazed at the destruction,,but I think there was a sense of disbelief,about the heroics of New Yorkers that I found very moving.,Just the sort of everyday heroics of New Yorkers. 
 So we were in this meeting and the contractor literally said,,"I'm going to lock the door, because this developer,will not agree to have you leave till you've signed off on this.",And we said, "Well, this is half the size,,it doesn't have any of the design features,that have been agreed upon by everyone -- everyone in the city.,We'd have to go back to the beginning to do this.",And I convinced him that we should leave the room,with the agreement to build it as designed. 
 The next day I got an email from the developer,saying that he was withdrawing all funding.,So we didn't know what to do,,but we decided to cast a very wide net.,We emailed out letters to as many people as we could --,several people in the audience here -- who were very helpful. 
 KA: There was no thought of abandoning ship at that point? 
 DR: No. In fact I told the contractor to go ahead.,He had already ordered materials based on my go-ahead.,We knew that one way or another this was going to happen.,And we just felt it had to happen. 
 KA: You were funding it yourself and with contributions and this foundation.,Richard, I think very correctly,,made the point at the beginning --,before all the chair designers came out --,about the history of chair designers imposing aesthetic solutions,on this kind of universal, banal, common problem of sitting.,It seems to me with this,,that it was the opposite of that.,This was an unprecedented, singular design problem. 
 DR: Well here's the issue:,we knew that this was not in the sense of --,we think about the site, and think about the need for a memorial.,It was important that this not be categorized as a memorial.,That this was a place for people to reflect, to remember --,a kind of quiet place. 
 So it led us to using design solutions,that created as few filters between the viewer --,as we said about the families' platform -- and the experience as possible.,It's all incredibly humble material.,It's scaffolding and plywood.,And it allows -- by sort of the procession of the movement,,up by Saint Paul's and down the other side --,it gives you about 300 feet to go up 13 feet from the ground,to where you get the 360 degree view. 
 But the design was driven by a need to be quick, cheap, safe, respectful, flexible.,One of the other things is this is designed to be moveable.,Because when we looked at the four platforms around the site,,one of which is an upgrade of the families' platform,,we knew that these had to be moveable,to respond to changing conditions,,and the changing definition of what Ground Zero is. 
 KA: Your work -- I mean, we've talked about this before --,a lot of your work, I think, is informed by your belief in, or your focus on,the temporariness of all things and the evanescence of things,,and a kind of "Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die,",sort of sense of existence.,This is clearly not a work for the ages.,You know, a couple of years this thing isn't going to be here.,Did that require, as an architect,,a new way of thinking about what you were doing?,To think of it as this purely temporary installation? 
 DR: No, I don't think so.,I think this is, obviously, substantially different,from anything we'd ever thought about doing before, just by the nature of it.,Where it overlaps with thoughts about our work in general is,,number one -- the notion of collaboration as a sort of way to get things done.,And Kevin Kennon, Rick Scofidio, Liz Diller,and all the people within the city --,Norman Lear, who I spoke to four hours before our deadline for funding,,offered to give us a bridge loan to help us get through it.,So the notion of collaboration --,I think this reinforces how important that is. 
 And in terms of the temporary nature of it,,our goal was not to create something,that would be there longer than it needed to be.,I think what we were most interested in was promoting a kind of dialogue,that we felt may not have been happening enough in this city,,about what's really happening there. 
 And a day or two before it opened was Giuliani's farewell address,,where he proposed the idea of all of Ground Zero being a memorial.,Which was very controversial, but it resonated with a lot of people.,And I think regardless of what the position is about how,this sacred piece of land is to be used,,having it come out of actually seeing it in a real encounter,,I think makes it a more powerful dialogue.,And that's what we were interested in.,So that, very much, is in the realm of things,I've been interested in before. 
 KA: It seems to me, among other things, a lovely piece of civic infrastructure.,It enables that conversation to get serious.,And six months after the fact --,and only a few months away from the site being cleaned --,we are very quickly, now, getting to the point,where those conversations about what should go there are getting serious.,Do you have -- having been as physically involved in the site,as you have been doing this project -- have any ideas about,what should or shouldn't be done? 
 DR: Well, I think one thing that shouldn't be done is evaluate --,I think right now the discussion is a very closed discussion on the master plan.,The Protetch Gallery recently had a show on ideas for buildings,,which had some sort of inventive ideas of buildings. 
 KA: But it had some really terrible ideas. 
 DR: And it also felt a little bit like a kind of competition of ideas,,where I think the focus of ideas should be on master planning and uses.,And I think there should be a broader -- which there's starting to be --,the dialogue is really opening up to,,what does this site really want to be?,And I truly believe until the issue of memorial is sorted out,,that it's going to be very hard to have an intelligent discussion.,There's a few discussions right now that I think are very positive,,about depressing the West Side Highway and connecting this over,,so that there's one uninterrupted piece of land. 
 KA: Well, I think that's interesting.,And it gets to another issue that was probably inappropriate,to discuss six months ago, but perhaps isn't now,,which is, not many of us love the World Trade Center as a piece of architecture,,as what it had done to this city and that huge plaza.,Is this an opportunity, is the silver lining --,a silver lining, here -- to rebuild,some more traditional city grid, or not? 
 DR: I think there's a real opportunity to engage,in a discussion of why we live in cities.,And why do we live in places where such dissimilar people,collide up against us each day?,I don't think it has much to do with 50 or 60 or 70 or 80 thousand new office spaces,,regardless of what the number is.,So yeah, I think there is a chance to re-look at how we think about cities. 
 And in fact, there's a proposal on the table now for building number seven. 
 KA: Which was the building just north of the Towers? 
 DR: Right, which the towers fell into.,And the reason that's been held up is essentially by community outrage,that they're not re-opening the street,to connect that back to the rest of the city.,I think a public dialogue -- I think, you know,,I'd like to see an international competition,,and a call for ideas for uses. 
 KA: Whether it's arts, whether it's housing,,whether it's what amount of shopping? 
 DR: Right. And we're looking for other things.,This small foundation we put together is looking for other ways to help.,Including taking a small piece adjacent to the site,and inviting 10 architects who currently don't have a voice,in New York to do artist housing.,And find other ways to encourage the discussion,to be against sort of monolithic, single solutions,,and more about a multiplicity of things. 
 KA: Before we end, I know you have a piece of digital video,of the experience of being on this platform? 
 DR: John Kamen -- who's here, actually -- put together,a two and a half minute piece that shows the platform in use.,So I thought that would be good to end with. 
 DR: We're looking from Fulton Street, west.,One of the tricky issues we had with the Giuliani administration,was I had forgotten how anti-graffiti he was.,And essentially our structure was designed to be written on. 
 KA: As you say, it's not a memorial.,But were you conscious of memorials? The Vietnam Memorial?,Those kinds of forms? 
 DR: We certainly did as much research as we could,,and we were conscious of other memorials.,And also the complexity and length of time they really take to do.,It's 350 people on the committee for Oklahoma City,,which is why we thought of this as a sort of ad-hoc, spontaneous solution,that expanded on Union Square,and the places that were ad-hoc memorials in the city already. 
 The scaffolding you can see built up over the street is de-mountable. 
 What's interesting now is the nature of the site has totally changed,,so that what you're aware of,is not just the destruction of the buildings in Ground Zero,,but all of the buildings around it --,and the scars on the building around it, which are enormous.,This shows Saint Paul's on the left. 
 KA: I just want to thank you on behalf of New Yorkers,for making this happen and getting this done.,But the kind of virtually instantaneous nature of its erection,,and its being there,,almost before you could believe,that a response of this magnitude could be accomplished,,is part of its extraordinary --,I don't know if beauty is the word --,but presence. 
 DR: It was an honor to do.,And we were thrilled to be able to show it here.As you pointed out, every time you come here, you learn something.,This morning, the world's experts,from I guess three or four different companies on building seats,,I think concluded that ultimately, the solution is, people shouldn't sit down.,I could have told them that.,(Laughter),Yesterday, the automotive guys gave us some new insights.,They pointed out that, I believe it was between 30 and 50 years from today,,they will be steering cars by wire,,without all that mechanical stuff.,(Laughter),That's reassuring.,(Applause),They then pointed out that there'd be, sort of, the other controls by wire,,to get rid of all that mechanical stuff.,That's pretty good, but why not get rid of the wires?,Then you don't need anything to control the car, except thinking about it.,I would love to talk about the technology,,and sometime, in what's past the 15 minutes,,I'll be happy to talk to all the techno-geeks around here,about what's in here.,But if I had one thing to say about this, before we get to first,,it would be that from the time we started building this,,the big idea wasn't the technology.,It really was a big idea in technology when we started applying it,in the iBOT for the disabled community.,The big idea here is, I think, a new piece of a solution,to a fairly big problem in transportation.,And maybe to put that in perspective: there's so much data on this,,I'll be happy to give it to you in different forms.,You never know what strikes the fancy of whom,,but everybody is perfectly willing to believe the car changed the world.,And Henry Ford, just about 100 years ago, started cranking out Model Ts.,What I don't think most people think about,is the context of how technology is applied.,For instance, in that time, 91 percent of America,lived either on farms or in small towns.,So, the car --,the horseless carriage that replaced the horse and carriage -- was a big deal;,it went twice as fast as a horse and carriage.,It was half as long.,And it was an environmental improvement, because, for instance,,in 1903 they outlawed horses and buggies in downtown Manhattan,,because you can imagine what the roads look like,when you have a million horses,,and a million of them urinating and doing other things,,and the typhoid and other problems created were almost unimaginable.,So the car was the clean environmental alternative to a horse and buggy.,It also was a way for people to get from their farm to a farm,,or their farm to a town, or from a town to a city.,It all made sense, with 91 percent of the people living there.,By the 1950s, we started connecting all the towns together,with what a lot of people claim is the eighth wonder of the world, the highway system.,And it is certainly a wonder.,And by the way, as I take shots at old technologies,,I want to assure everybody, and particularly the automotive industry --,who's been very supportive of us --,that I don't think this in any way competes with airplanes, or cars.,But think about where the world is today.,50 percent of the global population now lives in cities.,That's 3.2 billion people.,We've solved all the transportation problems,that have changed the world to get it to where we are today.,500 years ago, sailing ships started getting reliable enough;,we found a new continent.,150 years ago, locomotives got efficient enough, steam power,,that we turned the continent into a country.,Over the last hundred years, we started building cars,,and then over the 50 years we've connected every city to every other city,in an extraordinarily efficient way,,and we have a very high standard of living as a consequence of that.,But during that entire process, more and more people have been born,,and more and more people are moving to cities.,China alone is going to move four to six hundred million people,into cities in the next decade and a half.,And so, nobody, I think, would argue that airplanes, in the last 50 years,,have turned the continent and the country now into a neighborhood.,And if you just look at how technology has been applied,,we've solved all the long-range, high-speed, high-volume,,large-weight problems of moving things around.,Nobody would want to give them up.,And I certainly wouldn't want to give up my airplane,,or my helicopter, or my Humvee, or my Porsche.,I love them all. I don't keep any of them in my living room.,The fact is, the last mile is the problem,,and half the world now lives in dense cities.,And people spend, depending on who they are,,between 90 and 95 percent of their energy getting around on foot.,I think there's -- I don't know what data would impress you,,but how about, 43 percent of the refined fuel produced in the world,is consumed by cars in metropolitan areas in the United States.,Three million people die every year in cities due to bad air,,and almost all particulate pollution on this planet,is produced by transportation devices, particularly sitting in cities.,And again, I say that not to attack any industry,,I think -- I really do -- I love my airplane,,and cars on highways moving 60 miles an hour,are extraordinarily efficient,,both from an engineering point of view,,an energy consumption point of view, and a utility point of view.,And we all love our cars, and I do.,The problem is, you get into the city and you want to go four blocks,,it's neither fun nor efficient nor productive.,It's not sustainable.,If -- in China, in the year 1998, 417 million people used bicycles;,1.7 million people used cars.,If five percent of that population became, quote, middle class,,and wanted to go the way we've gone in the last hundred years,at the same time that 50 percent of their population are moving into cities,of the size and density of Manhattan, every six weeks --,it isn't sustainable environmentally;,it isn't sustainable economically -- there just ain't enough oil --,and it's not sustainable politically.,I mean, what are we fighting over right now?,We can make it complicated, but what's the world fighting over right now?,So it seemed to me that somebody had to work on that last mile,,and it was dumb luck. We were working on iBOTs,,but once we made this, we instantly decided,it could be a great alternative to jet skis. You don't need the water.,Or snowmobiles. You don't need the snow.,Or skiing. It's just fun, and people love to move around doing fun things.,And every one of those industries, by the way --,just golf carts alone is a multi-billion-dollar industry.,But rather than go license this off, which is what we normally do,,it seemed to me that if we put all our effort not into the technology,,but into an understanding of a world that's solved all its other problems,,but has somehow come to accept that cities -- which,,right back from ancient Greece on, were meant to walk around,,cities that were architected and built for people --,now have a footprint that,,while we've solved every other transportation problem --,and it's like Moore's law.,I mean, look at the time it took to cross a continent in a Conestoga wagon,,then on a railroad, then an airplane.,Every other form of transportation's been improved.,In 5,000 years, we've gone backwards in getting around cities.,They've gotten bigger; they're spread out.,The most expensive real estate on this planet in every city --,Wilshire Boulevard, or Fifth Avenue, or Tokyo, or Paris --,the most expensive real estate is their downtowns.,65 percent of the landmass of our cities are parked cars.,The 20 largest cities in the world.,So you wonder, what if cities could give to their pedestrians,what we take for granted as we now go between cities?,What if you could make them fun, attractive, clean,,environmentally friendly?,What if it would make it a little bit more palatable,to have access via this, as that last link to mass transit,,to get out to your cars so we can all live in the suburbs,and use our cars the way we want,,and then have our cities energized again?,We thought it would be really neat to do that,,and one of the problems we really were worried about,is: how do we get legal on the sidewalk?,Because technically I've got motors; I've got wheels -- I'm a motor vehicle.,I don't look like a motor vehicle.,I have the same footprint as a pedestrian;,I have the same unique capability,to deal with other pedestrians in a crowded space.,I took this down to Ground Zero,,and knocked my way through crowds for an hour.,I'm a pedestrian. But the law typically lags technology by a generation or two,,and if we get told we don't belong on the sidewalk, we have two choices.,We're a recreational vehicle that doesn't really matter,,and I don't spend my time doing that kind of stuff.,Or maybe we should be out in the street,in front of a Greyhound bus or a vehicle.,We've been so concerned about that,,we went to the Postmaster General of the United States,,as the first person we ever showed on the outside,,and said, "Put your people on it. Everybody trusts their postman.,And they belong on the sidewalks, and they'll use it seriously.",He agreed. We went to a number of police departments,that want their police officers back in the neighborhood,on the beat, carrying 70 pounds of stuff. They love it.,And I can't believe a policeman is going to give themselves a ticket.,(Laughter),So we've been working really, really hard,,but we knew that the technology would not be as hard to develop,as an attitude about what's important, and how to apply the technology.,We went out and we found some visionary people,with enough money to let us design and build these things,,and in hopefully enough time to get them accepted.,So, I'm happy, really, I am happy to talk about this technology as much as you want.,And yes, it's really fun, and yes, you should all go out and try it.,But if I could ask you to do one thing,,it's not to think about it as a piece of technology,,but just imagine that, although we all understand somehow,that it's reasonable that we use our 4,000-pound machine,,which can go 60 miles an hour,,that can bring you everywhere you want to go,,and somehow it's also what we used for the last mile,,and it's broken, and it doesn't work.,One of the more exciting things that occurred to us,about why it might get accepted, happened out here in California.,A few weeks ago, after we launched it,,we were here with a news crew on Venice Beach, zipping up and back,,and he's marveling at the technology,,and meanwhile bicycles are zipping by,,and skateboarders are zipping by,,and a little old lady -- I mean, if you looked in the dictionary,,a little old lady -- came by me --,and now that I'm on this, I'm the height of a normal adult now --,and she just stops, and the camera is there, and she looks up at me,and says, "Can I try that?",And what was I -- you know, how are you going to say anything?,And so I said, "Sure.",So I get off, and she gets on, and with a little bit of the usual, ah,,then she turns around, and she goes about 20 feet,,and she turns back around, and she's all smiles.,And she comes back to me and she stops, and she says,,"Finally, they made something for us.",And the camera is looking down at her.,I'm thinking, "Wow, that was great --,(Laughter),-- please lady, don't say another word.",(Laughter),And the camera is down at her,,and this guy has to put the microphone in her face,,said, "What do you mean by that?",And I figured, "It's all over now,",and she looks up and she says, "Well,",she's still watching these guys go; she says, "I can't ride a bike," no,,she says, "I can't use a skateboard, and I've never used roller blades,",she knew them by name;,she says, "And it's been 50 years since I rode a bicycle.",Then she looks up, she's looking up, and she says,,"And I'm 81 years old, and I don't drive a car anymore.,I still have to get to the store, and I can't carry a lot of things.",And it suddenly occurred to me, that among my many fears,,were not just that the bureaucracy and the regulators,and the legislators might not get it --,it was that, fundamentally, you believe there's pressure among the people,not to invade the most precious little bit of space left,,the sidewalks in these cities.,When you look at the 36 inches of legal requirement for sidewalk,,then the eight foot for the parked car, then the three lanes,,and then the other eight feet -- it's --,that little piece is all that's there.,But she looks up and says this,,and it occurs to me, well, kids aren't going to mind these things,,and they don't vote, and business people and then young adults,aren't going to mind these things -- they're pretty cool --,so I guess subliminally I was worried,that it's the older population that's going to worry.,So, having seen this, and having worried about it for eight years,,the first thing I do is pick up my phone and ask our marketing and regulatory guys,,call AARP, get an appointment right away.,We've got to show them this thing.,And they took it to Washington; they showed them;,and they're going to be involved now,,watching how these things get absorbed in a number of cities,,like Atlanta, where we're doing trials to see if it really can, in fact,,help re-energize their downtown.,(Applause),The bottom line is, whether you believe the United Nations,,or any of the other think tanks --,in the next 20 years, all human population growth on this planet,will be in cities.,In Asia alone, it will be over a billion people.,They learned to start with cell phones.,They didn't have to take the 100-year trip we took.,They start at the top of the technology food chain.,We've got to start building cities and human environments,where a 150-pound person can go a couple of miles,in a dense, rich, green-space environment,,without being in a 4,000-pound machine to do it.,Cars were not meant for parallel parking;,they're wonderful machines to go between cities, but just think about it:,we've solved all the long-range, high-speed problems.,The Greeks went from the theater of Dionysus to the Parthenon in their sandals.,You do it in your sneakers.,Not much has changed.,If this thing goes only three times as fast as walking -- three times --,a 30-minute walk becomes 10 minutes.,Your choice, when living in a city, if it's now 10 minutes --,because at 30 minutes you want an alternative, whether it's a bus, a train --,we've got to build an infrastructure -- a light rail --,or you're going to keep parking those cars.,But if you could put a pin in most cities,,and imagine how far you could, if you had the time, walk in one half-hour, it's the city.,If you could make it fun, and make it eight or 10 minutes,,you can't find your car, un-park your car, move your car,,re-park your car and go somewhere;,you can't get to a cab or a subway.,We could change the way people allocate their resources,,the way this planet uses its energy,,make it more fun.,And we're hoping to some extent history will say we were right.,That's Segway. This is a Stirling cycle engine;,this had been confused by a lot of things we're doing.,This little beast, right now, is producing a few hundred watts of electricity.,Yes, it could be attached to this,,and yes, on a kilogram of propane,,you could drive from New York to Boston if you so choose.,Perhaps more interesting about this little engine is it'll burn any fuel,,because some of you might be skeptical,about the capability of this to have an impact,,where most of the world you can't simply plug into your 120-volt outlet.,We've been working on this,,actually, as an alternative energy source,,starting way back with Johnson & Johnson, to run an iBOT,,because the best batteries you could get --,10 watt-hours per kilogram in lead,,20 watt-hours per kilogram nickel-cadmium,,40 watt-hours per kilogram in nickel-metal hydride,,60 watt-hours per kilogram in lithium,,8,750 watt-hours of energy in every kilogram of propane or gasoline --,which is why nobody drives electric cars.,But, in any event, if you can burn it with the same efficiency --,because it's external combustion -- as your kitchen stove,,if you can burn any fuel, it turns out to be pretty neat.,It makes just enough electricity to, for instance, do this,,which at night is enough electricity, in the rest of the world,,as Mr. Holly -- Dr. Holly -- pointed out,,can run computers and a light bulb.,But more interestingly, the thermodynamics of this say,,you're never going to get more than 20 percent efficiency.,It doesn't matter much -- it says if you get 200 watts of electricity,,you'll get 700 or 800 watts of heat.,If you wanted to boil water and re-condense it at a rate of 10 gallons an hour,,it takes about 25, a little over 25.3 kilowatt --,25,000 watts of continuous power -- to do it.,That's so much energy, you couldn't afford to desalinate,or clean water in this country that way.,Certainly, in the rest of the world, your choice is to devastate the place,,turning everything that will burn into heat, or drink the water that's available.,The number one cause of death on this planet among humans is bad water.,Depending on whose numbers you believe,,it's between 60 and 85,000 people per day.,We don't need sophisticated heart transplants around the world.,We need water.,And women shouldn't have to spend four hours a day looking for it,,or watching their kids die.,We figured out how to put a vapor-compression distiller on this thing,,with a counter-flow heat exchanger to take the waste heat,,then using a little bit of the electricity control that process,,and for 450 watts, which is a little more than half of its waste heat,,it will make 10 gallons an hour of distilled water,from anything that comes into it to cool it.,So if we put this box on here in a few years,,could we have a solution to transportation, electricity,,and communication, and maybe drinkable water,in a sustainable package that weighs 60 pounds?,I don't know, but we'll try it.,I better shut up.,(Applause)I am going to talk about myself,,which I rarely do, because I --,well for one thing, I prefer to talk about things I know nothing about.,And secondly, I'm a recovering narcissist.,(Laughter),I didn't know I was a narcissist actually.,I thought narcissism meant you loved yourself.,And then someone told me there is a flip side to it.,So it's actually drearier than self-love;,it's unrequited self-love.,(Laughter),I don't feel I can afford a relapse. 
 But I want to, though, explain,how I came to design my own particular brand of comedy,because I've been through so many different forms of it.,I started with improvisation,,in a particular form of improvisation called theater games,,which had one rule,,which I always thought was a great rule for an ethic for a society.,And the rule was, you couldn't deny the other person's reality,,you could only build on it. 
 And of course we live in a society that's all about,contradicting other peoples' reality.,It's all about contradiction,,which I think is why I'm so sensitive to contradiction in general.,I see it everywhere.,Like polls. You know, it's always curious to me,that in public opinion polls,the percentage of Americans who don't know the answer to any given question,is always two percent.,75 percent of Americans,think Alaska is part of Canada.,But only two percent don't know the effect,that the debacle in Argentina will have on the IMF's monetary policy --,(Laughter),seems a contradiction.,Or this ad that I read in the New York Times:,"Wearing a fine watch speaks loudly of your rank in society.,Buying it from us screams good taste.",(Laughter),Or this that I found in a magazine called California Lawyer,,in an article that is surely meant for the lawyers at Enron.,"Surviving the Slammer: Do's and Don'ts.",(Laughter),"Don't use big words.",(Laughter),"Learn the lingua franca.",(Laughter),Yeah. "Lingua this, Frankie." 
 (Laughter) 
 And I suppose it's a contradiction that I,talk about science when I don't know math.,You know, because -- and by the way to I was so grateful to Dean Kamen,for pointing out that one of the reasons,,that there are cultural reasons,that women and minorities don't enter the fields of science and technology --,because for instance, the reason I don't do math is,,I was taught to do math and read at the same time.,So you're six years old, you're reading Snow White and the Seven Dwarves,,and it becomes rapidly obvious,that there are only two kinds of men in the world:,dwarves and Prince Charmings.,And the odds are seven to one against your finding the prince.,(Laughter),That's why little girls don't do math. It's too depressing. 
 (Laughter) 
 Of course, by talking about science,I also may, as I did the other night,,incur the violent wrath of some scientists,who were very upset with me.,I used the word postmodern as if it were OK.,And they got very upset.,One of them, to his credit, I think really just wanted to engage me,in a serious argument.,But I don't engage in serious arguments.,I don't approve of them,because arguments, of course, are all about contradiction,,and they're shaped by the values that I have questions with. 
 I have questions with the values of Newtonian science,,like rationality. You're supposed to be rational in an argument.,Well rationality is constructed,by what Christie Hefner was talking about today,,that mind-body split, you know?,The head is good, body bad.,Head is ego, body id.,When we say "I," -- as when Rene Descartes said,,"I think therefore I am," --,we mean the head.,And as David Lee Roth sang in "Just a Gigolo,","I ain't got no body.",That's how you get rationality.,And that's why so much of humor,is the body asserting itself against the head.,That's why you have toilet humor and sexual humor.,That's why you have the Raspyni Brothers,whacking Richard in the genital area.,And we're laughing doubly then,because he's the body, but it's also -- 
 Voice offstage: Richard. 
 Emily Levine: Richard. What did I say?,(Laughter),Richard. Yes but it's also the head,,the head of the conference. 
 That's the other way that humor --,like Art Buchwald takes shots at the heads of state.,It doesn't make quite as much money as body humor I'm sure --,(Laughter),but nevertheless, what makes us treasure you and adore you. 
 There's also a contradiction in rationality in this country though,,which is, as much as we revere the head,,we are very anti-intellectual.,I know this because I read in the New York Times,,the Ayn Rand foundation took out a full-page ad,after September 11,,in which they said, "The problem is not Iraq or Iran,,the problem in this country, facing this country,is the university professors and their spawn.",(Laughter),So I went back and re-read "The Fountainhead.",(Laughter),I don't know how many of you have read it.,And I'm not an expert on sadomasochism.,(Laughter),But let me just read you a couple of random passages from page 217. 
 "The act of a master,taking painful contemptuous possession of her,,was the kind of rapture she wanted.,When they lay together in bed it was,,as it had to be, as the nature of the act demanded,,an act of violence.,It was an act of clenched teeth and hatred. It was the unendurable.,Not a caress, but a wave of pain.,The agony as an act of passion." 
 So you can imagine my surprise,on reading in The New Yorker,that Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve,,claims Ayn Rand as his intellectual mentor.,(Laughter),It's like finding out your nanny is a dominatrix.,(Laughter),Bad enough we had to see J. Edgar Hoover in a dress.,Now we have to picture Alan Greenspan,in a black leather corset, with a butt tattoo that says,,"Whip inflation now." 
 (Laughter) 
 And Ayn Rand of course, Ayn Rand,is famous for a philosophy called Objectivism,,which reflects another value of Newtonian physics,,which is objectivity.,Objectivity basically is constructed,in that same S&M way.,It's the subject subjugating the object.,That's how you assert yourself.,You make yourself the active voice.,And the object is the passive no-voice. 
 I was so fascinated by that Oxygen commercial.,I don't know if you know this but --,maybe it's different now, or maybe you were making a statement --,but in many hospital nurseries across the country,,until very recently anyway, according to a book by Jessica Benjamin,,the signs over the little boys cribs read,,"I'm a boy,",and the signs over the little girls cribs read,,"It's a girl." Yeah.,So the passivity was culturally,projected onto the little girls. 
 And this still goes on as I think I told you last year.,There's a poll that proves --,there was a poll that was given by Time magazine,,in which only men were asked, "Have you ever had sex,with a woman you actively disliked?",And well, yeah.,Well, 58 percent said yes,,which I think is overinflated though,because so many men if you just say,,"Have you ever had sex ... " "Yes!",They don't even wait for the rest of it.,(Laughter),And of course two percent did not know whether they'd had --,(Laughter),That's the first callback,,of my attempted quadruple. 
 (Laughter) 
 So this subject-object thing,,is part of something I'm very interested in,because this is why, frankly, I believe in political correctness.,I do. I think it can go too far.,I think Ringling Brothers may have gone too far,with an ad they took out in the New York Times Magazine.,"We have a lifelong emotional and financial,commitment to our Asian Elephant partners.",(Laughter),Maybe too far. But you know --,I don't think that,a person of color making fun of white people,is the same thing as a white person making fun of people of color.,Or women making fun of men is the same as men making fun of women.,Or poor people making fun of rich people, the same as rich people. 
 I think you can make fun of the have but not the have-nots,,which is why you don't see me making fun of,Kenneth Lay and his charming wife.,(Laughter),What's funny about being down to four houses?,(Laughter),And I really learned this lesson,during the sex scandals of the Clinton administration or,,Or as I call them, the good ol' days.,(Laughter),When people I knew, you know, people who considered themselves liberal,,and everything else,,were making fun of Jennifer Flowers and Paula Jones.,Basically, they were making fun of them for being,trailer trash or white trash.,It seems, I suppose, a harmless prejudice,and that you're not really hurting anybody.,Until you read, as I did, an ad in the Los Angeles Times.,"For sale: White trash compactor.",(Laughter) 
 So this whole subject-object thing,has relevance to humor in this way.,I read a book by a woman named Amy Richlin,,who is the chair of the Classics department at USC.,And the book is called "The Garden of Priapus.",And she says that Roman humor,mirrors the construction of Roman society.,So that Roman society was very top/bottom,,as ours is to some degree.,And so was humor.,There always had to be the butt of a joke.,So it was always the satirist,,like Juvenal or Martial,,represented the audience,,and he was going to make fun of the outsider,,the person who didn't share that subject status. 
 And in stand-up of course,,the stand-up comedian is supposed to dominate the audience.,A lot of heckling is the tension,of trying to make sure that the,comedian is going to be able to dominate,,and overcome the heckler.,And I got good at that when I was in stand up.,But I always hated it because they were,dictating the terms of the interaction,,in the same way that engaging in a serious argument,determines the content, to some degree,,of what you're talking about.,And I was looking for a form,that didn't have that.,And so I wanted something that was more interactive.,I know that word is so debased now,by the use of it by Internet marketers. 
 I really miss the old telemarketers now, I'll tell you that.,(Laughter),I do, because at least there you stood a chance. You know?,I used to actually hang up on them.,But then I read in "Dear Abby" that that was rude.,So the next time that one called,I let him get halfway through his spiel and then I said,,"You sound sexy.",(Laughter),He hung up on me! 
 (Laughter) 
 But the interactivity allows the audience,to shape what you're going to do as much as,you shape their experience of the world.,And that's really what I'm looking for.,And I was sort of, as I was starting to analyze,what exactly it is that I do,,I read a book called "Trickster Makes This World," by Lewis Hyde.,And it was like being psychoanalyzed.,I mean he had laid it all out.,And then coming to this conference,,I realized that most everybody here,shared those same qualities,because really what trickster is,is an agent of change.,Trickster is a change agent.,And the qualities that I'm about to describe,are the qualities that make it possible,to make change happen.,And one of these is boundary crossing.,I think this is what so, in fact, infuriated the scientists.,But I like to cross boundaries.,I like to, as I said, talk about things I know nothing about. 
 (Phone Ringing) 
 I hope that's my agent,,because you aren't paying me anything. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I think it's good to talk about things I know nothing about,because I bring a fresh viewpoint to it, you know?,I'm able to see the contradiction,that you may not be able to see.,Like for instance a mime once --,or a meme as he called himself.,He was a very selfish meme.,And he said that I had to show more respect,because it took up to 18 years,to learn how to do mime properly.,And I said, "Well, that's how you know only stupid people go into it.",(Laughter),It only takes two years to learn how to talk. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 And you know people, this is the problem with,quote, objectivity, unquote.,When you're only surrounded by people,who speak the same vocabulary as you,,or share the same set of assumptions as you,,you start to think that that's reality.,Like economists, you know, their definition of rational,,that we all act out of our own economic self-interest.,Well, look at Michael Hawley,,or look at Dean Kamen,,or look at my grandmother. 
 My grandmother always acted in other people's interests,,whether they wanted her to or not.,(Laughter),If they had had an Olympics in martyrdom,,my grandmother would have lost on purpose.,(Laughter),"No, you take the prize.,You're young. I'm old. Who's going to see it?,Where am I going? I'm going to die soon." 
 (Laughter) 
 So that's one -- this boundary crossing,,this go-between which --,Fritz Lanting, is that his name,,actually said that he was a go-between.,That's an actual quality of the trickster.,And another is, non-oppositional strategies.,And this is instead of contradiction.,Where you deny the other person's reality,,you have paradox,where you allow more than one reality to coexist, 
 I think there's another philosophical construction.,I'm not sure what it's called.,But my example of it is a sign that I saw in a jewelry store.,It said, "Ears pierced while you wait.",(Laughter),There the alternative just boggles the imagination.,(Laughter),"Oh no. Thanks though, I'll leave them here. Thanks very much.,I have some errands to run. So I'll be back to pick them up,around five, if that's OK with you.,Huh? Huh? What? Can't hear you." 
 (Laughter) 
 And another attribute of the trickster,is smart luck.,That accidents, that Louis Kahn, who talked about accidents,,this is another quality of the trickster.,The trickster has a mind that is prepared for the unprepared.,That, and I will say this to the scientists,,that the trickster has the ability to hold,his ideas lightly,so that he can let room in for new ideas,or to see the contradictions or the hidden problems,with his ideas.,I had no joke for that.,I just wanted to put the scientists in their place.,(Laughter) 
 But here's how I think I like to make change,,and that is in making connections.,This is what I tend to see,almost more than contradictions.,Like the, what do you call those toes of the gecko?,You know, the toes of the gecko,,curling and uncurling like the fingers of Michael Moschen.,I love connections. 
 Like I'll read that one of the two attributes,of matter in the Newtonian universe --,there are two attributes of matter in the Newtonian universe --,one is space occupancy. Matter takes up space.,I guess the more you matter the more space you take up,,which explains the whole SUV phenomenon.,(Laughter),And the other one though is impenetrability. 
 Well, in ancient Rome, impenetrability,was the criterion of masculinity.,Masculinity depended on you,being the active penetrator.,And then, in economics, there's an active producer,and a passive consumer,,which explains why business always has to,penetrate new markets.,Well yeah, I mean why we forced China,to open her markets.,And didn't that feel good?,(Laughter),And now we're being penetrated.,You know the biotech companies are actually going inside us,and planting their little flags on our genes.,You know we're being penetrated.,And I suspect, by someone who actively dislikes us.,(Laughter),That's the second of the quadruple.,Yes of course you got that. Thank you very much.,I still have a way to go. 
 (Laughter) 
 And what I hope to do, when I make these connections,,is short circuit people's thinking.,You know, make you not follow your usual,train of association,,but make you rewire.,It literally -- when people say about the shock of recognition,,it's literally re-cognition, rewiring how you think --,I had a joke to go with this and I forgot it.,I'm so sorry. I'm getting like,the woman in that joke about -- 
 have you heard this joke about the woman driving with her mother?,And the mother is elderly.,And the mother goes right through a red light.,And the daughter doesn't want to say anything.,She doesn't want to be like, "You're too old to drive.",And the mother goes through a second red light.,And the daughter says, as tactfully as possible,,"Mom, are you aware that you just went through two red lights?",And the mother says, "Oh! Am I driving?" 
 (Laughter) 
 And that's the shock of recognition,at the shock of recognition.,That completes the quadruple. 
 (Laughter) 
 I just want to say two more things.,One is, another characteristic of trickster,is that the trickster has to,walk this fine line.,He has to have poise.,And you know the biggest hurdle for me,,in doing what I do,,is constructing my performance,so that it's prepared and unprepared.,Finding the balance between those things,is always dangerous,because you might tip off too much in the direction of unprepared.,But being too prepared doesn't leave room,for the accidents to happen. 
 I was thinking about what Moshe Safdie,said yesterday about beauty,because in his book, Hyde says that,sometimes trickster can tip over into beauty.,But to do that you have to,lose all the other qualities,because once you're into beauty,you're into a finished thing.,You're into something that,occupies space and inhabits time.,It's an actual thing.,And it is always extraordinary to see a thing of beauty.,But if you don't do that,,if you allow for the accident to keep on happening,,you have the possibility of getting on a wavelength.,I like to think of what I do as a probability wave.,When you go into beauty the probability wave,collapses into one possibility.,And I like to explore all the possibilities,in the hope that you'll be on the wavelength of your audience. 
 And the one final quality I want to say about trickster is,that he doesn't have a home.,He's always on the road.,I want to say to you Richard, in closing,,that in TED you've created a home.,And thank you for inviting me into it.,Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I'm a historian.,Steve told us about the futurenof little technology;,I'm going to show you somenof the past of big technology.,This was a project to build a 4,000-tonnnuclear bomb-propelled spaceship,and go to Saturn and Jupiter.,This took place in my childhood, 1957-65.,It was deeply classified.,I'm going to show you some stuffnthat not only has not been declassified,,but has now been reclassified. 
 (Laughter) 
 If all goes well, next year I'll be back,,and I'll have a lot more to show you,nand if all doesn't go well,,I'll be in jail, like Wen Ho Lee. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, this ship was basicallynthe size of the Marriott Hotel,,a little taller and a little bigger.,And one of the peoplenwho worked on it at the beginning,was my father, Freeman,nthere in the middle.,That's me and my sister, Esther,nwho's a frequent TEDster.,I didn't like nuclearnbomb-propelled spaceships.,I mean, I thought it was a great idea,nbut I started building kayaks.,So we had a few kayaks.,Just so you knownthat I am not Dr. Strangelove. 
 But all the time I was out therendoing these strange kayak voyages,in odd, beautiful parts of this planet,,I always thought in the backnof my mind about Project Orion,,and how my father and his friendsnwere going to build these big ships.,They were actually going to go --,Ted Taylor, who led the project,nwas going to take his children.,My father was not goingnto take his children,,that was one of the reasons we sortnof had a falling out for a few years. 
 (Laughter) 
 The project began in '57nat General Atomics there,,that's right on the coast at La Jolla.,Look at that central buildingnright in the middle of the picture.,That's the 130-foot diameter library.,That is exactly the sizenof the base of the spaceship.,So put that librarynat the bottom of that ship --,that's how big the thing was going to be.,It would take two or three thousand bombs.,The people who worked on itnwere a lot of the Los Alamos people,who had done the hydrogen bomb work.,It was the first project funded by ARPA.,That's the contract where ARPAngave the first million dollars,to get this thing started.,"Spaceship project officially begun.nJob waiting for you. Dyson.",That's July '58.,Two days later, the space traveler'snmanifesto explaining why --,just like we heard yesterday --nwhy we need to go into space:,"... trips to satellitesnof the outer planets.,August 20, 1958." 
 These are the statistics of what would benthe good places to go and stop.,Some of the sizes of the ships,,ranging all the way upnto ship mass of 8 million tons.,So that was the outer extreme.,Here was version two: 2,000 bombs.,These are five-kiloton yield bombs,nabout the size of small Volkswagens;,it would take 800 to get into orbit.,Here we see a 10,000-ton shipnwill deliver 1,300 tons,to Saturn and back --nessentially, a five-year trip.,Possible departure dates:nOctober 1960 to February 1967.,These are trajectories going to Mars.,All this was done by hand,nwith slide rules.,The little Orion ship,,and what it would takento do what Orion does with chemicals:,you have a ship the sizenof the Empire State Building. 
 NASA had no interest;nthey tried to kill the project.,The people who supported itnwere the Air Force,,which meant that it was all secret.,And that's why when you get somethingndeclassified, that's what it looks like.,Military weapon versionsnthat carried hydrogen bombs,that could destroy half the planet.,There's another version there that sendsnretaliatory strikes at the Soviet Union.,This is the really secret stuff:,how to get directed energy explosions.,So you're sending the energynof a nuclear explosion --,not like just a stick of dynamite,nbut you're directing it at the ship.,And this is still a very active subject.,It's quite dangerous,,but I believe it's better to havendangerous things in the open,than think you're goingnto keep them secret. 
 This is what happenednat 600 microseconds.,The Air Force startednto build smaller models,and actually started doing this.,The guys in La Jolla said,n"We've got to get started now.",They built a high-explosivenpropelled model.,These are stills fromnfilm footage that was saved,by someone who was supposednto destroy it but didn't,,and kept it in their basementnfor the last 40 years.,So, these are three-pound charges of C4;,that's about 10 timesnwhat the guy had in his shoes. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is Ed Day putting --,So each of these coffee cansnhas three pounds of C4 in it.,They're building a system that ejectsnthese at quarter-second intervals.,That's my dad in the sport coat there,nholding the briefcase.,So, they had a lot of fun doing this.,But no children were allowed;,my dad could tell me he was buildingna spaceship and going to go to Saturn,,but he could not saynanything more about it. 
 So all my life I have wantednto find this stuff out,,and spent the last four yearsntracking these old guys down.,These are stills from the video.,Jeff Bezos kindly, yesterday,nsaid he'll put this video up,on the Amazon site --nsome little clip of it. 
 (Applause) 
 So, thanks to him.,They got quite seriousnabout the engineering of this.,The size of that mass, for us,,is really large technology in a waynwe're never going to go back to.,If you saw the 1959 --,this is what it would feelnlike in the passenger compartment;,that's acceleration profile. 
 (Laughter) 
 And pulse-system yield:nwe're looking at 20-kiloton yield,for an effective thrustnof 10 million newtons.,Well, here we have a little problem,nthe radiation doses at the crew station:,700 rads per shot. 
 (Laughter) 
 Fission yields during development:,they were hoping to getnclean bombs; they didn't.,Eyeburn: this is what happensnto the people in Miami who are looking up. 
 (Laughter) 
 Personnel compartment noise: that'snnot too bad; it's very low frequencies,,it's basically like these sub-woofers.,And now we have ground-hazard assessmentsnwhen you have a blow-up on the pad.,Finally, at the very end in 1964,nNASA steps in and says,,"OK, we'll support a feasibility studynfor a small version,that could be launched with Saturn Vsnin sections and pieced together." 
 So this is what NASA did,,getting an eight-man versionnthat would go to Mars.,They liked it because the guys couldnkind of live there and be like,,"It's like living in a submarine.",This is crew compartment.,It switches, so what'snupside down is right side up,when you go to artificial gravity mode.,The scientists were stillngoing to go along;,they would take seven astronautsnand seven scientists.,This is a 20-man versionnfor going to Jupiter:,bunks, storm cellars, exercise room.,You know, it was goingnto be a nice, long trip. 
 The Air Force version:nhere we have a military version.,This is the kind of stuffnthat's not been declassified,,just that people managed to sneaknhome and after, you know,,on their deathbed,nbasically, gave me that.,The sort of artist conceptions.,These are basicallynPowerPoint presentations,given to the Air Force 40 years ago.,Look at the little guys therenoutside the vehicle.,And one part of NASA was interested in it,,but the headquarters in NASA,nthey killed the project.,So finally, at the end,,we can see the thing followednits sort of design path right up to 1965,,and then all those paths came to a halt. 
 Results: none.,This project is hereby terminated.,So that's the end. 
 All I can say in closing is:,we heard yesterday that one of the 10nbad things that could happen to us,is an asteroid with our name on it.,And one of the bad thingsnthat could happen to NASA,is if that asteroid shows upnwith our name on it nine months out,,and everybody says,,"Well, what are we going to do?",And Orion is really onenof the only, if not the only,,off-the-shelf technologiesnthat could do something. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I'm going to tell younthe good news and the bad news.,The good news is that NASA has a small,nsecret contingency-plan division,that is looking at this, tryingnto keep knowledge of Orion preserved,in the event of such a misfortune.,Maybe keep a few littlenbombs of plutonium on the side.,That's the good news.,The bad news is, when I gotnin contact with these people,to try and get some documentsnfrom them, they went crazy,because I had all this stuffnthat they don't have,,and NASA purchased 1,759 pagesnof this stuff from me.,So that's the state we're at;nit's not very good. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause)I'll just start talkingnabout the 17th century.,I hope nobody finds that offensive.,I -- you know, when I --nafter I had invented PCR,,I kind of needed a change.,And I moved down to La Jollanand learned how to surf.,And I started living down therenon the beach for a long time.,And when surfers are out waiting,for waves,,you probably wonder, if you've nevernbeen out there, what are they doing?,You know, sometimes there's a 10-,n15-minute break out there,when you're waiting for a wave to come in.,They usually talk about the 17th century.,You know, they get a realnbad rap in the world.,People think they're sort of lowbrows.,One day, somebody suggestednI read this book.,It was called --,it was called "The Air Pump,",or something like "ThenLeviathan and The Air Pump.",It was a real weird booknabout the 17th century.,And I realized, the roots,of the way I sort of thought,was just the only naturalnway to think about things.,That -- you know, I was bornnthinking about things that way,,and I had alwaysnbeen like a little scientist guy.,And when I went to find out something,,I used scientific methods.nI wasn't real surprised,,you know, when they first told me how --,how you were supposed to do science,,because I'd already been doing itnfor fun and whatever.,But it didn't -- it never occurred to me,that it had to be invented,and that it had been invented,only 350 years ago.,You know, it was --,like it happened in England,nand Germany, and Italy,sort of all at the same time.,And the story of that,,I thought, was really fascinating.,So I'm going to talkna little bit about that,,and what exactly is itnthat scientists are supposed to do.,And it's, it's a kind of --,You know, Charles I got beheaded,somewhere early in the 17th century.,And the English set up Cromwell,and a whole bunchnof Republicans or whatever,,and not the kind of Republicans we had.,They changed the government,nand it didn't work.,And,Charles II, the son,,was finally put backnon the throne of England.,He was really nervous,nbecause his dad had been,,you know, beheaded for beingnthe King of England,And he was nervous about the fact,that conversations that got going,in, like, bars and stuff,would turn to --,this is kind of -- it's hard to believe,,but people in the 17th century in England,were starting to talk about, you know,,philosophy and stuff in bars.,They didn't have TV screens,,and they didn't havenany football games to watch.,And they would get really pissy,,and all of a sudden people would spillnout into the street and fight,about issues like whether or not,it was okay if Robert Boyle,made a device called the vacuum pump.,Now, Boyle was a friend of Charles II.,He was a Christian guynduring the weekends,,but during the week he was a scientist.,(Laughter),Which was -- back then it was,sort of, you know, well, you know --,if you made this thing --nhe made this little device,,like kind of like a bicycle pump,in reverse that could sucknall the air out of --,you know what a bell jar is?nOne of these things,,you pick it up, put itndown, and it's got a seal,,and you can see inside of it,,so you can see what's goingnon inside this thing.,But what he was trying to donwas to pump all the air out of there,,and see what would happen inside there.,I mean, the first -- I thinknone of the first experiments he did,was he put a bird in there.,And people in the 17th century,,they didn't really understandnthe same way we do,about you know, this stuff is,a bunch of different kinds of molecules,,and we breathe itnin for a purpose and all that.,I mean, fish don't know much about water,,and people didn't know much about air.,But both started exploring it.,One thing, he put a bird in there,nand he pumped all the air out,,and the bird died. So he said, hmm...,He said -- he callednwhat he'd done as making --,they didn't call itna vacuum pump at the time.,Now you call it a vacuumnpump; he called it a vacuum.,Right? And immediately,,he got into trouble with the local clergy,who said, you can't make a vacuum.,Ah, uh --,(Laughter),Aristotle said that nature abhors one.,I think it was a poorntranslation, probably,,but people reliednon authorities like that.,And you know, Boyle says, well, shit.,I make them all the time.,I mean, whatevernthat is that kills the bird --,and I'm calling it a vacuum.,And the religious people said that,if God wanted you to make --,I mean, God is everywhere,,that was one of their rules,nis God is everywhere.,And a vacuum --nthere's nothing in a vacuum,,so you've -- God couldn't be in there.,So therefore the church said that youncan't make a vacuum, you know.,And Boyle said, bullshit.,I mean, you want to call it Godless,,you know, you call it Godless.,But that's not my job. I'm not into that.,I do that on the weekend. And like --,what I'm trying to donis figure out what happens,when you suck everythingnout of a compartment.,And he did all thesencute little experiments.,Like he did one with --nhe had a little wheel,,like a fan, that was,sort of loosely attached,nso it could spin by itself.,He had another fan opposed to it,that he had like a --,I mean, the way I would have donenthis would be, like, a rubber band,,and, you know, around a tinkerntoy kind of fan.,I know exactly how he didnit; I've seen the drawings.,It's two fans, one which he couldnturn from outside,after he got the vacuum established,,and he discovered that if he pullednall the air out of it,,the one fan would no longernturn the other one, right?,Something was missing, you know.nI mean, these are --,it's kind of weird to think that someonenhad to do an experiment to show that,,but that was what was goingnon at the time.,And like, there was big arguments about it,in the -- you know, the gin housesnand in the coffee shops and stuff.,And Charles,started not liking that.,Charles II was kind of saying, younknow, you should keep that --,let's make a place wherenyou can do this stuff,where people don't get so -- you know,,we don't want the -- we don't want to getnthe people mad at me again. And so --,because when they startedntalking about religion,and science and stuff like that,,that's when it had sort of gottennhis father in trouble.,And so,,Charles said, I'm goingnto put up the money,give you guys a building,,come here and you cannmeet in the building,,but just don't talknabout religion in there.,And that was fine with Boyle.,He said, OK, we're goingnto start having these meetings.,And anybody who wants to do science is --,this is about the time that IsaacnNewton was starting to whip out,a lot of really interesting things.,And there was all kind of peoplenthat would come to the Royal Society,,they called it. You had to bendressed up pretty well.,It wasn't like a TED conference.,That was the only criteria,nwas that you be --,you looked like a gentleman,nand they'd let anybody could come.,You didn't have to be a member then.,And so, they would comenin and you would do --,Anybody that was goingnto show an experiment,,which was kind of a new word at the time,,demonstrate some principle,,they had to do it on stage,nwhere everybody could see it.,So they were --,the really important part of this was,,you were not supposed to talk,about final causes, for instance.,And God was out of the picture.,The actual nature of realitynwas not at issue.,You're not supposed to talknabout the absolute nature of anything.,You were not supposednto talk about anything,that you couldn't demonstrate.,So if somebody could see it, you couldnsay, here's how the machine works,,here's what we do, and thennhere's what happens.,And seeing what happens, it was OK,to generalize,,and say, I'm sure that thisnwill happen anytime,we make one of these things.,And so you can start making up some rules.,You say, anytime you have a vacuum state,,you will discover that one wheelnwill not turn another one,,if the only connection between them,is whatever was there before the vacuum.nThat kind of thing.,Candles can't burn in a vacuum,,therefore, probablynsparklers wouldn't either.,It's not clear; actually sparklers will,,but they didn't know that.,They didn't have sparklers. But, they --,(Laughter),-- you can make up rules,nbut they have to relate,only to the thingsnthat you've been able to demonstrate.,And most the demonstrationsnhad to do with visuals.,Like if you do an experiment on stage,,and nobody can see it, they can just hear it,nthey would probably think you were freaky.,I mean, reality is what you can see.,That wasn't an explicitnrule in the meeting,,but I'm sure that was part of it,nyou know. If people hear voices,,and they can't see and associatenit with somebody,,that person's probably not there.,But the general ideanthat you could only --,you could only really talknabout things in that place,that had some kind of experimental basis.,It didn't matter what Thomas Hobbes,,who was a local philosopher,,said about it, you know,,because you weren't goingnto be talking final causes.,What's happening here,,in the middle of the 17th century,,was that what became my field --,science, experimental science --,was pulling itself away,,and it was in a physical way, because we'rengoing to do it in this room over here,,but it was also what -- itnwas an amazing thing that happened.,Science had been all interlocked,with theology, and philosophy,,and -- and -- and mathematics,,which is really not science.,But experimental science hadnbeen tied up with all those things.,And the mathematics part,and the experimental science part,was pulling away from philosophy.,And -- things --,we never looked back.,It's been so cool since then.,I mean, it just -- it just -- untangledna thing that was really impeding,technology from being developed.,And, I mean, everybody in this room --,now, this is 350 short years ago.,Remember, that's a short time.,It was 300,000, probably, years ago,that most of us, the ancestorsnof most of us in this room,came up out of Africanand turned to the left.,You know, the ones that turnednto the right, there are some of those,in the Japanese translation.,But that happened very -- a long time ago,compared to,350 short years ago.,But in that 350 years,,the place has just undergonena lot of changes.,In fact, everybody in this room probably,,especially if you picked up your bag --,some of you, I know, didn'tnpick up your bags --,but if you picked up your bag,neverybody in this room,has got in their pocket,nor back in their room,,something,that 350 years ago,,kings would have gone to war to have.,I mean, if you can think how important --,If you have a GPS systemnand there are no satellites,,it's not going to be much use.nBut, like --,but, you know, if somebodynhad a GPS system,in the 17th century,some king would havengotten together an army,and gone to get it, you know.nIf that person --,Audience: For the teddy bear?nThe teddy bear?,Kary Mullis: They might have donenit for the teddy bear, yeah.,But -- all of us own stuff.,I mean, individuals own things,that kings would havendefinitely gone to war to get.,And this is just 350 years.,Not a whole lot of peoplendoing this stuff.,You know, the important people --,you can almost read about their lives,,about all the really importantnpeople that made advances, you know.,And, I mean --,this kind of stuff, younknow, all this stuff,came from that separation,of this little sort of thing that we do --,now I, when I was a boy,was born sort of with this idea,that if you want to know something --,you know, maybe it's because my oldnman was gone a lot,,and my mother didn'tnreally know much science,,but I thought if you wantnto know something about stuff,,you do it -- you makenan experiment, you know.,You get -- you get, like --,I just had a natural feeling for science,and setting up experiments. I thoughtnthat was the way everybody had always thought.,I thought that anybodynwith any brains will do it that way.,It isn't true. I mean,nthere's a lot of people --,You know, I was one of thosenscientists that was --,got into trouble the other night at dinner,because of the post-modernism thing.,And I didn't mean, you known-- where is that lady?,Audience: Here.,(Laughter),KM: I mean, I didn't reallynthink of that as an argument,so much as just a lively discussion.,I didn't take it personally, but --,I just -- I had -- I naively had thought,,until this surfing experiencenstarted me into the 17th century,,I'd thought that's justnthe way people thought,,and everybody did,nand they recognized reality,by what they could seenor touch or feel or hear.,At any rate, when I was a boy,,I, like, for instance, I had this --,I got this little booknfrom Fort Sill, Oklahoma --,This is about the timenthat George Dyson's dad,was starting to blow nuclear --,thinking about blowingnup nuclear rockets and stuff.,I was thinking about makingnmy own little rockets.,And I knew that frogs -- little frogs --,had aspirations of space travel,,just like people. And I --,(Laughter),I was looking for a --,a propulsion system,that would like, make a rocket, like,,maybe about four feet highngo up a couple of miles.,And, I mean, that was my sort of goal.,I wanted it to go out of sight and thennI wanted this little parachute,to come back with the frog in it.,And -- I -- I --,I got this book from Fort Sill, Oklahoma,,where there's a missile base.,They send it out for amateur rocketeers,,and,it said in there,do not ever heat a mixturenof potassium perchlorate and sugar.,(Laughter),You know,,that's what you call a lead.,(Laughter),You sort of -- now you say,nwell, let's see if I can,get hold of some potassium chloratenand sugar, perchlorate and sugar,,and heat it; it would be interesting to seenwhat it is they don't want me to do,,and what it is going to --nand how is it going to work.,And we didn't have --,like, my mother,presided over the back yard,from an upstairs window,,where she would be ironingnor something like that.,And she was usually justnsort of keeping an eye on,,and if there was any puffsnof smoke out there,,she'd lean out and admonish us all,not to blow our eyes out. That was her --,You know, that was kind of the worstnthing that could happen to us.,That's why I thought, as longnas I don't blow my eyes out...,I may not care about the fact,that it's prohibitednfrom heating this solution.,I'm going to do itncarefully, but I'll do it.,It's like anything else that's prohibited:,you do it behind the garage.,(Laughter),So, I went to the drug store,and I tried to buynsome potassium perchlorate,and it wasn't unreasonable then for a kid,to walk into a drug storenand buy chemicals.,Nowadays, it's no ma'am,,check your shoes. And like --,(Laughter),But then it wasn't -- they didn'tnhave any, but the guy had --,I said, what kind of saltsnof potassium do you have? You know.,And he had potassium nitrate.,And I said, that might donthe same thing, whatever it is.,I'm sure it's got to do with rocketsnor it wouldn't be in that manual.,And so I -- I did some experiments.,You know, I startednoff with little tiny amounts,of potassium nitrate and sugar,,which was readily available,,and I mixed it in different proportions,,and I tried to light it on fire.,Just to see what would happen,nif you mixed it together.,And it -- they burned.,It burned kind of slow,nbut it made a nice smell,,compared to other rocketnfuels I had tried,,that all had sulfur in them.,And, it smelt like burnt candy.,And then I tried the meltingnbusiness, and I melted it.,And then it melted into a little sortnof syrupy liquid, brown.,And then it cooledndown to a brick-hard substance,,that when you lit that,,it went off like a bat.,I mean, the little bowl of that stuffnthat had cooled down --,you'd light it, and it would justnstart dancing around the yard.,And I said, there,is a way to get a frognup to where he wants to go.,(Laughter),So I started developing --,you know, George's dad had a lot of help.nI just had my brother.,But I -- it took menabout -- it took me about,,I'd say, six months,to finally figurenout all the little things.,There's a lot of little things involved,in making a rocket that itnwill actually work,,even after you have the fuel.,But you do it, by -- what I just--,you know, you do experiments,,and you write down things sometimes,,you make observations, you know.,And then you slowly build up a theory,of how this stuff works.,And it was --nI was following all the rules.,I didn't know what the rules were,,I'm a natural born scientist, I guess,,or some kind of a throwbacknto the 17th century, whatever.,But at any rate, we finally did,have a device that would reproduceably,put a frog out of sight,and get him back alive.,And we had not --,I mean, we weren't frightened by it.,We should have been,nbecause it made a lot of smoke,and it made a lot of noise,,and it was powerful, you know.,And once in a while, they would blow up.,But I wasn't worried, by the way,,about, you know,,the explosion causingnthe destruction of the planet.,I hadn't heard about the 10 ways,that we should be afraid of the --,By the way,,I could have thought,,I'd better not do this because,they say not to, you know.,And I'd better get permissionnfrom the government.,If I'd have waited around for that,,I would have never -- the frognwould have died, you know.,At any rate, I bring itnup because it's a good story,,and he said, tell personal things,nyou know, and that's a personal --,I was going to tell you about the firstnnight that I met my wife,,but that would be toonpersonal, wouldn't it.,So, so I've got somethingnelse that's not personal.,But that... processnis what I think of as science,,see, where you start with some idea,,and then instead of, like, looking up,,every authority that you've ever heard of,I -- sometimes you do that,,if you're going to write a paper later,,you want to figurenout who else has worked on it.,But in the actual process,nyou get an idea --,like, when I got the idea one night,that I could amplify DNAnwith two oligonucleotides,,and I could make lots of copiesnof some little piece of DNA,,you know, the thinking for that,was about 20 minutesnwhile I was driving my car,,and then instead of going -- I wentnback and I did talk to people about it,,but if I'd listened to what I heardnfrom all my friends who were molecular biologists --,I would have abandoned it.,You know, if I had gone backnlooking for an authority figure,who could tell me if it would work or not,,he would have said, no, it probably won't.,Because the results of itnwere so spectacular,that if it worked it was going to changeneverybody's goddamn way of doing molecular biology.,Nobody wants a chemist to come in,and poke around in their stuffnlike that and change things.,But if you go to authority,nand you always don't --,you don't always getnthe right answer, see.,But I knew, you'd go into the lab,and you'd try to make it work yourself.nAnd then you're the authority,,and you can say, I know it works,,because right there in that tube,is where it happened,,and here, on this gel,nthere's a little band there,that I know that's DNA,nand that's the DNA I wanted to amplify,,so there! So it does work.,You know, that's how you do science.,And then you say, well,nwhat can make it work better?,And then you figure out betternand better ways to do it.,But you always work from, from like, facts,that you have made available to you,by doing experiments: thingsnthat you could do on a stage.,And no tricky shit behind the thing.nI mean, it's all --,you've got to be very honest,with what you're doing if itnreally is going to work.,I mean, you can't make up results,,and then do another experimentnbased on that one.,So you have to be honest.,And I'm basically honest.,I have a fairly bad memory, and dishonestynwould always get me in trouble,,if I, like -- so I've justnsort of been naturally honest,and naturally inquisitive,,and that sort of leadsnto that kind of science.,Now, let's see...,I've got another five minutes, right?,OK. All scientists aren't like that.,You know -- and there is a lot --,(Laughter),There is a lot -- a lotnhas been going on since,Isaac Newton and all that stuff happened.,One of the things that happenednright around World War II,in that same time period before,,and as sure as hell afterwards,,government got -- realizednthat scientists aren't strange dudes,that, you know, hide in ivory towers,and do ridiculous things with test tube.,Scientists, you know, made World War II,as we know it quite possible.,They made faster things.,They made bigger gunsnto shoot them down with.,You know, they made drugsnto give the pilots,if they were broken up in the process.,They made all kinds of --nand then finally one giant bomb,to end the whole thing, right?,And everybody stepped backna little and said, you know,,we ought to invest in this shit,,because whoever has gotnthe most of these people,working in the places is goingnto have a dominant position,,at least in the military, and probablynin all kind of economic ways.,And they got involvednin it, and the scientific,and industrial establishment was born,,and out of that came a lot of scientists,who were in there for the money, you know,,because it was suddenly available.,And they weren't the curious little boys,that liked to put frogs up in the air.,They were the same people that laternwent in to medical school, you know,,because there was money in it, you know. I mean,nlater, then they all got into business --,I mean, there are waves of --ngoing into your high school,,person saying, you want to be rich, you know,nbe a scientist. You know, not anymore.,You want to be rich, you be a businessman.,But a lot of people got in it for the moneynand the power and the travel.,That's back when travel was easy.,And those people don't think --,they don't --,they don't always tellnyou the truth, you know.,There is nothingnin their contract, in fact,,that makes it to their advantage always,,to tell you the truth.,And the people I'm talkingnabout are people that like --,they say that they'rena member of the committee,called, say, the Inter-GovernmentalnPanel on Climate Change.,And they -- and they have these bignmeetings where they try to figure out,how we're going to -- how we'rengoing to continually prove,that the planet is getting warmer,,when that's actually contrarynto most people's sensations.,I mean, if you actually measure,the temperature over a period --,I mean, the temperaturenhas been measured now,pretty carefully for about 50, 60 years --,longer than that it's been measured,,but in really nice, precise ways,,and records have been keptnfor 50 or 60 years,,and in fact, the temperaturenhadn't really gone up.,It's like, the average temperature,has gone up a tiny little bit,,because the nighttime temperatures,at the weather stations havencome up just a little bit.,But there's a good explanation for that.,And it's that the weather stationsnare all built outside of town,,where the airport was, and now,the town's moved out there,nthere's concrete all around,and they call it the skyline effect.,And most responsible people,that measure temperatures realize,you have to shieldnyour measuring device from that.,And even then, you know,,because the buildings getnwarm in the daytime,,and they keep it a little warmer at night.,So the temperature hasnbeen, sort of, inching up.,It should have been. But not a lot.nNot like, you know --,the first guy -- the firstnguy that got the idea,that we're going to fry ourselves here,,actually, he didn't think of it that way.,His name was Sven Arrhenius.nHe was Swedish, and he said,,if you double the CO2nlevel in the atmosphere,,which he thought mightn-- this is in 1900 --,the temperature ought to gonup about 5.5 degrees, he calculated.,He was thinking of the earthnas, kind of like,,you know, like a completelyninsulated thing,with no stuff in it, really,,just energy coming down, energy leaving.,And so he came up with this theory,,and he said, this will be cool,,because it'll be a longerngrowing season in Sweden,,you know, and the surfers liked it,,the surfers thought, that's a cool idea,,because it's pretty coldnin the ocean sometimes, and --,but a lot of other people later on,started thinking itnwould be bad, you know.,But nobody actuallyndemonstrated it, right?,I mean, the temperature as measured --,and you can find thisnon our wonderful Internet,,you just go and looknfor all NASAs records,,and all the Weather Bureau's records,,and you'll look at it yourself,nand you'll see, the temperature has just --,the nighttime temperature measurednon the surface of the planet,has gone up a tiny little bit.,So if you just average that and the daytimentemperature, it looks like it went up,about .7 degrees in this century.,But in fact, it was just coming up --,it was the nighttime; the daytimentemperatures didn't go up.,So -- and Arrhenius' theory --,and all the global warmers think --,they would say, yeah, it shouldngo up in the daytime, too,,if it's the greenhouse effect.,Now, people like thingsnthat have, like, names like that,,that they can envision it, right?nI mean --,but people don't like thingsnlike this, so -- most -- I mean,,you don't get all excited about things,like the actual evidence, you know,,which would be evidence for strengthening,of the tropical circulation in the 1990s.,It's a paper that came out in February,,and most of you probablynhadn't heard about it.,"Evidence for Large Decadal Variability,in the Tropical MeannRadiative Energy Budget.",Excuse me. Those papersnwere published by NASA,,and some scientistsnat Columbia, and Viliki,and a whole bunch of people, Princeton.,And those two papers camenout in Science Magazine,,February the first,,and these -- the conclusionnin both of these papers,,and in also the Science editor's, like,,descriptions of thesenpapers, for, you know,,for the quickie,,is that our theories about global warming,are completely wrong. I mean,,what these guys were doing,,and this is what -- the NASA peoplenhave been saying this for a long time.,They say, if you measure the temperaturenof the atmosphere, it isn't going up --,it's not going up at all. We've doingnit very carefully now for 20 years,,from satellites, and it isn't going up.,And in this paper, they shownsomething much more striking,,and that was that they didnwhat they call a radiation --,and I'm not going to go into the detailsnof it, actually it's quite complicated,,but it isn't as complicatednas they might make you think it is,by the words they use in those papers.nIf you really get down to it, they say,,the sun puts out a certainnamount of energy --,we know how much that is --,it falls on the earth, the earthngives back a certain amount.,When it gets warm it generates --,it makes redder energy --nI mean, like infra-red,,like something that's warmngives off infra-red.,The whole businessnof the global warming --,trash, really,,is that -- if the -- if there's toonmuch CO2 in the atmosphere,,the heat that's trying to escape,won't be able to get out. Butnthe heat coming from the sun,,which is mostly down in the --nit's like 350 nanometers,,which is where it's centered --nthat goes right through CO2.,So you still get heated,nbut you don't dissipate any.,Well, these guys measurednall of those things.,I mean, you can talk about that stuff,,and you can write these large reports,nand you can get government money to do it,,but these -- they actually measured it,,and it turnsnout that in the last 10 years --,that's why they say "decadal" there --,that the energy -- that the level,of what they call "imbalance",has been way the hellnover what was expected.,Like, the amount of imbalance --,meaning, heat's comingnin and it's not going out,that you would getnfrom having double the CO2,,which we're not anywherennear that, by the way.,But if we did, in 2025 or something,,have double the CO2 as we had in 1900,,they say it would benincrease the energy budget,by about -- in other words,,one watt per square centimeter more,would be coming in than going out.,So the planet should get warmer.,Well, they found out in thisnstudy -- these two studies,by two different teams --,that five and a half watts,per square meter,had been coming in from 1998, 1999,,and the place didn't get warmer.,So the theory's kaput -- it's nothing.,These papers should have been called,,"The End to the GlobalnWarming Fiasco," you know.,They're concerned,,and you can tell they have verynguarded conclusions in these papers,,because they're talkingnabout big laboratories,that are funded by lots of money,and by scared people.,You know, if they said, you know what?,There isn't a problemnwith global warming any longer,,so we can -- you know, they're funding.,And if you start a grant requestnwith something like that,,and say, global warmingnobviously hadn't happened...,if they -- if they -- if they actuallyn-- if they actually said that,,I'm getting out.,(Laughter),I'll stand up too, and --,(Laughter),(Applause),They have to say that.,They had to be very cautious.,But what I'm saying is,nyou can be delighted,,because the editornof Science, who is no dummy,,and both of these fairly professional --,really professional teams, havenreally come to the same conclusion,and in the bottom lines in their papers,they have to say, what this meansnis, that what we've been thinking,,was the global circulationnmodel that we predict,that the earth is going to get overheated,that it's all wrong.nIt's wrong by a large factor.,It's not by a small one. They just --,they just misinterpretednthe fact that the earth --,there's obviously some mechanisms going on,that nobody knew about,,because the heat's comingnin and it isn't getting warmer.,So the planet is a prettynamazing thing, you know,,it's big and horrible --nand big and wonderful,,and it does all kinds of thingsnwe don't know anything about.,So I mean, the reason I putnthose things all together,,OK, here's the way you'rensupposed to do science --,some science is done for othernreasons, and just curiosity.,And there's a lot of thingsnlike global warming,,and ozone hole and you know,,a whole bunch of scientific public issues,,that if you're interested in them,,then you have to get down the details,nand read the papers called,,"Large Decadal Variability in the...",You have to figurenout what all those words mean.,And if you just listen to the guys,who are hyping those issues,nand making a lot of money out of it,,you'll be misinformed, and you'll benworrying about the wrong things.,Remember the 10 things that are goingnto get you. The -- one of them --,(Laughter),And the asteroids is the one I reallynagree with there.,I mean, you've got to watch out for asteroids.nOK, thank you for having me here.,(Applause)[SHIT] 
 This is arguably the back endnof the design of animals. 
 (Laughter) 
 But the reasonnI put this up here is because,when I was in Africa last year,nmy wife and I were driving around,,we had this wonderful guide,,who showed us somethingnthat surprised both of us,,and it was very revealingnin terms of the fascination,that comes with the design of animals.,It turns out that in about the 1880s,nthe missionaries came to Africa,to spread the word of Christianity,,to teach English to the natives.,And they brought blackboards and chalk.,And I'd like you to imaginenthat that's a blackboard,,and I just used some chalk on there.,And they broughtnquite a bit of this stuff.,But over the years,nthe blackboards were fine,,but they ran out of chalk.,And this is a real crisis for them. 
 And that's where the hyena comes in.,The hyena is probablynthe most perfectly designed,scavenging animal in the world.,It strip-mines carcasses,nand it has amazing teeth,,because it enables the hyenanto essentially eat bones.,Now, the end product of that actionnis up on the board here.,What the missionaries would do is,nthey'd walk around,and they'd pick up hyena shit.,And the incredible thingnabout hyena shit is, it makes great chalk. 
 (Laughter) 
 That's not what I'm here to talk about,,but it is a fascinating aspectnof animal design.,What I'm here to talk about is the camel.,When I started talking to Richard,about what I was going to speak about,,I had recently come back from Jordan,,where I had an amazingnexperience with a camel. 
 (Laughter) 
 And we were in the desert. 
 Richard Wurman: That's the end!nKeith Bellows: Yeah, yeah. 
 We were in the desert,nin Wadi Rum, in a small Jeep.,There were four of us,ntwo Bedouin drivers.,You can just imagine,nthis expanse is an ocean of sand,,105 degrees, one water bottle.,And we were driving in what they told usnwas their very, very best Jeep.,Didn't look like it to me.,And as we started to gonthrough the desert,,the Jeep broke down.,The guys got out, they put the hood up,,they started workingnunder the hood, got it going again.,About a hundred yards, it broke down.,This went on about 6-7 times,nwe were getting more and more alarmed,,we were also getting deepernand deeper into the desert. 
 And eventually,nour worst nightmare happened:,they flooded the engine.,And they said, "Ah, no problem!nWe just get out and walk.",And we said, "We get out and walk?",One water bottle, remember,nguys, four people.,And they said, "Yeah, yeah, we'll walk.nWe'll find some camels.",We got out and walked, and sure enough,,about half a mile, we camenover the crest of this hill,,and there was a huge gatheringnof Bedouin with their camels.,The guy went up and started dickering,,and 10 dollars later, we had four camels.,They went down like elevators;nwe got on them.,They went back up, and the Bedouin,neach Bedouin, four of them,,got behind each of the camelsnwith a little whip.,And they started slashing awaynat the back of the camels,,and they started galloping.,And if you've ever been on a camel,nit is a very, very uncomfortable ride.,There's also one other aspectnabout these camels.,About every 10 steps, they lean back,and try to take a chunk out of your leg. 
 (Laughter) 
 So we kept on going,,and this camel kept on tryingnto take a chunk out of my leg.,And eventually, three miles later,nwe arrived at our destination,,where a Jeep was supposed to meet us.,And the camels come downnagain like elevators,,we sort of clumsily get off,,and they, obviously, try to takenanother chunk out of my leg.,And I've developedna very wonderful relationship,with this creature by this point,,and I've realizednthat this is a mean son of a bitch.,And much meaner, by the way,nthan the Bedouin who greeted me,and tried to sell menone of his 26 daughters,to take back to the States. 
 So as we talked, Richard and I,,I said, "You know, maybenI should bring a camel.,It's the best designednanimal in the world.",He went, "Nah. I don't thinknwe want to be bringing a camel.",And you should be really gladnwe decided not to bring the camel.,So I did the next best thing.,I went to the Washington Zoo.,Richard said, "I want you to get upnclose and personal with this camel.,I want you to inspect its mouth,nlook at its teeth.,Go underneath it.nGo above it. Go around it.,Pull its tail up; take a look in there.,I want you to get as closento that camel as you possibly can." 
 So, I got a National Geographic film crew.,We went down there,nand I took one look at this camel.,It is a 2,000 pound creaturenwho is in rut. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, if you've ever seenna 2,000 pound camel in rut,,it is a scary, scary thing to behold.,And if Richard thought I was gettingnin the ring with that camel,,someone was smoking Bedouin high grade. 
 (Laughter) 
 So we got as close to it as possible,,and I'm going to share this.,Chris, if you want to roll this film.,Then I'm going to show you,a little bit morenabout the design of camels. 
 Do you want to roll the film? 
 (Adventure music) 
 (Video) Hello. This is Keith Bellows,with the TED National GeographicnCamel Investigation Unit.,I'm here to looknat the ultimate desert machine. 
 (Music continues) 
 Keith Bellows: And you'll notenI started chewing gum,because I was around this camel all day. 
 (Video) That's it, OK. No!,See, now he's gettingna little overexcited.,So we'll need to be very carefulnaround him. Don't let him get you.,Now, you can see copious amountsnof saliva in there.,I always called myselfnthe unstable stable boy.,Their nose, you can seenhis nose is flared right now.,When they're in rut,nthey're similar to seals,in the way, like, a seal hasnto open its nose to breathe.,And they're similar.nThey have to consciously open their nose. 
 KB: Ears? 
 SK: They are small.nBut they have excellent hearing.,But not big; for instance,nin zebras, they have a huge ear,that's very mobile, so they cannactually turn them both around.,And they use them in the same waynwe use our binocular vision.,They use that to pinpoint sound.,The desert's extremely windynas well as being very cold.,So not only do they haventhe very long eyelashes,,but there's the secondary --,I guess you'd call itnthe [unclear] or whatever.,It's this hair that's above the eyes,nand below it, it's longer. 
 Most people thinknthat the humps store water.,They don't. They store fat.,Now, I'm not a chemist,nbut basically what happens,is the fat is oxidized by their breathing.,And that will turn itninto actually usable water.,Like a lot of predators,nthey walk on their toes.,But there's a big fat padnin there that squishes out.,They're like sun shoes,nbut, you know, with sand.,Hooves? They don't haventraditional hooves,,but they do have one, like, big nail. 
 (Audience laughter) 
 You can't really see too clear.nThe fur's kind of grown over.,But they use their tails a lot,nespecially in rut.,He will urinate and spin his tailnto spread the urine around,and make him more attractive.,I don't know why that would be,nbut it works for them.,So, what the hell. 
 (Audience laughter) 
 Now, they will also defecatenin certain areas.,Generally, they poopnwherever they want to,,but during their rut,nthey will defecate in perimeter areas.,I don't know if you've read or heardnabout the sub-sonic sounds from elephants,,you know what I mean, like, "Br-r-r!",These big, big rumbling sounds.nHe will do the same thing.,You can actually see,nright here, it will vibrate.,We weigh our animals.,Unfortunately,nhe's a very aggressive animal,,so he's actually destroyednsome of the scales.,We had these big things that I weighnthe bison on, for instance.,I'm guessing thatnhe's at least 1,600 pounds.,But I would put him closer to 2,000.,He's basically a walking mulch pile.,We're kind of like buds,nbut I'm also a male as well. 
 KB: He sees you as competition?nSenior Keeper: Yeah, exactly.,And it makes him very dangerousnat this time of year.,Don't even think about it.nDon't think about it! 
 But now, we're going to meet. Out!,Out! Out!,No.,Out! 
 (Music) 
 (Applause) 
 KB: What I didn't show you was,nyou got that swinging thing going?,Well, and you're gladnI didn't show you this.,One of the other thingsnabout the camel's beautiful design,is that its penis points backwards.,That way the camel can dipnits tail in the stream,,and just whackernthe entire area around him.,And that's hownhe really marks his territory.,Now, what you also didn't see was that --,and you may have noticednin the pen beside him,and, by the way, the camel's name is Suki.,In the pen beside him is Jasmine.,Jasmine has been his mate for some time.,But on this particular occasion,nit was very, very clear,that as horny as Suki was,nJasmine was having none of it.,And so we started thinking.,Well, if poor old Sukinis in search of a mate,,what would Suki do to findnthe perfect mate? 
 I'm going to show you another film.,But before I do, I just want to mention,that this animal truly is a sortnof the SUV of the sand,,the ship of the desert.,It's so vital to the inhabitantsnof the areas,in which the camel is found,nlargely Mongolia and Sahara,,that there are 160 wordsnin Arabic to describe the camel.,And if this is a creaturenthat was designed by committee,,it's certainly beennlike no committee I've ever been on.,So here's what Suki would donin search of a mate.,Can you roll it, please? 
 Camel seeking camel,Lusty beast desiresnattractive and sincere mate.,I'm seven feet, 2,000 lbs.,nwith brown hair and eyes, long legs --,and I'm very well ... hung.,I'm TED Camel.,The perfect desert machine.,I'm smartly designed.,Eyelashes that keep out sand,and a third eyelash that worksnlike a windshield wiper.,A distinguished nose --,with nostrils linednto filter out sand and dust,and a groove that catches moisture.,Amazingly full lips --,that allow me to eat practicallynanything that grows.,Callouses on my kneesnthat let me kneel comfortably.,Leathery chest pads that beat the heat.,Short fur that keeps my skin cool.,Long legs that allow heat to escape.,And my hump?,Ogden Nash once wrote:,"The camel has a single hump;nthe dromedary two,,or else the other way around.nI'm never sure. Are you?",Here's a hint:,Bactarian.,Dromedary.,My hump contains up to 80 lbs. of fat,nbut doesn't store H2O.,I'm built to last.,I'm the go-to animalnwhen the oasis is dry.,I usually won't sweatnuntil my body reaches 105 ºF,,enough to fry an egg.,I'm able to lose 40\%nof my weight without dying.,(Most animals wouldnif they lost half that much.),I'll drink 5 to 7 gallonsnof water a day.,But go without for more than a month.,I'm powerful.,Able to pack up to 400 lbs. of cargo.,Outrun a horse --,And cover 26 miles on a good day.,Camelot.,Jackie O. once saidnthat traveling by camel,made riding an elephant seemnlike taking a jet plane.,Yet my large, soft feetnallow me to navigate sand.,(Is that why the Bedouinnclaim I can dance?),I'm a good provider, too.,Bedouins call the camel the Gift of God.,No surprise.,Tents and rugs are made of my hair.,My dried bones are prizednas a sort of ivory.,My dung is burned as fuel.nMy milk is used for cheese.,"Camels are like angels,"na Bedouin once said. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. I just want to leave younwith one last thought,,which is probably the most importantnthing to take away.,Humans, the animal, are pretty luckyncreatures because, by and large,,we really don't havento adapt to our environment;,we adapt our environment to us.,And we've seen that repeatedlynthrough this conference,,not just this year, but in past years.,But this creature that you've just seen,ultimately adapts,nand keeps adapting and adapting.,I think when you looknat the animal kingdom,,that is one of the most remarkable things.,It doesn't have an environmentnthat adapts to it;,it has to adapt to the environment. 
 Ricky, thank you very much for having me. 
 RW: That's terrific. Thank you.What I want to do today is to spend,some time talking about some stuff that's,sort of giving me a little bit of,existential angst, for lack of a better word,,over the past couple of years, and,basically, these three quotes,tell what's going on.,"When God made the color purple,,God was just showing off," Alice Walker,wrote in "The Color Purple," and,Zora Neale Hurston wrote in,"Dust Tracks On A Road,","Research is a formalized curiosity.,It's poking and prying with a purpose.",And then finally,,when I think about the near future,,you know, we have this attitude, well,,whatever happens, happens. Right?,So that goes along with the Chesire Cat,saying, "If you don't care much,where you want to get to,,it doesn't much matter which way you go.",But I think it does matter,which way we go, and what road we take,,because when I think about design in the,near future, what I think are the most,important issues, what's really,crucial and vital is that we need,to revitalize the arts and sciences,right now in 2002.,(Applause),If we describe the near future,as 10, 20, 15 years from now,,that means that what we do today,is going to be critically important,,because in the year 2015,,and the year 2020, 2025, the world,our society is going to be building on,,the basic knowledge and abstract ideas,,the discoveries that we came up with today,,just as all these wonderful things we're,hearing about here at the TED conference,that we take for granted in the world,right now, were really knowledge,and ideas that came up,in the '50s, the '60s, and the '70s.,That's the substrate that we're exploiting,today, whether it's the internet,,genetic engineering, laser scanners,,guided missiles, fiber optics, high-definition,television, sensing, remote-sensing,from space and the wonderful,remote-sensing photos that we see in,3D weaving, TV programs like Tracker,,and Enterprise, CD rewrite drives,,flatscreen, Alvin Ailey's Suite Otis,,or Sarah Jones' "Your Revolution Will Not,Be Between These Thighs," which,by the way was banned by the FCC,,or ska, all of these things,without question, almost without exception,,are really based on ideas,and abstract and creativity,from years before,,so we have to ask ourselves,,what are we contributing to that legacy,right now? And when I think about it,,I'm really worried. To be quite frank,,I'm concerned. I'm skeptical,that we're doing very much of anything.,We're, in a sense, failing to act,in the future. We're purposefully,,consciously being laggards.,We're lagging behind.,Frantz Fanon, who was a psychiatrist,from Martinique, said, "Each generation,must, out of relative obscurity,,discover its mission, and fulfill or betray it.",What is our mission? What do we have,to do? I think our mission is,to reconcile, to reintegrate,science and the arts, because right now,there's a schism that exists,in popular culture. You know,,people have this idea that science,and the arts are really separate.,We think of them as separate,and different things, and this idea was,probably introduced centuries ago,,but it's really becoming critical now,,because we're making decisions about our,society every day that,,if we keep thinking that the arts,are separate from the sciences,,and we keep thinking it's cute to say,,"I don't understand anything about this one,,I don't understand anything about the other,one," then we're going to have problems.,Now I know no one here at TED,thinks this. All of us, we already know,that they're very connected, but I'm going,to let you know that some folks,in the outside world, believe it or not,,they think it's neat when they say,,"You know, scientists and science is not,creative. Maybe scientists are ingenious,,but they're not creative.,And then we have this tendency, the career,counselors and various people say things,like, "Artists are not analytical.,They're ingenious, perhaps,,but not analytical," and,when these concepts underly our teaching,and what we think about the world,,then we have a problem, because we,stymie support for everything.,By accepting this dichotomy,,whether it's tongue-in-cheek, when,we attempt to accommodate it in our world,,and we try to build our foundation,for the world, we're messing up the future,,because, who wants to be uncreative?,Who wants to be illogical?,Talent would run from either of these fields,if you said you had to choose either.,Then they're going to go to something,where they think, "Well, I can be creative,and logical at the same time.",Now I grew up in the '60s and I'll admit it,,actually, my childhood spanned the '60s,,and I was a wannabe hippie and I always,resented the fact that I wasn't really,old enough to be a hippie.,And I know there are people here, the,younger generation who want to be hippies,,but people talk about the '60s all the time,,and they talk about the anarchy,that was there, but when I think about,the '60s, what I took away from it was,that there was hope for the future.,We thought everyone could participate.,There were wonderful, incredible ideas,that were always percolating,,and so much of what's cool or hot today,is really based on some of those concepts,,whether it's, you know, people trying to,use the prime directive from Star Trek,being involved in things, or again that,three-dimensional weaving and,fax machines that I read about in my,weekly readers that the technology,and engineering was just getting started.,But the '60s left me with a problem.,You see, I always assumed I would go,into space, because I followed all of this,,but I also loved the arts and sciences.,You see, when I was growing up as,a little girl and as a teenager,,I loved designing and making dogs' clothes,and wanting to be a fashion designer.,I took art and ceramics. I loved dance.,Lola Falana. Alvin Ailey. Jerome Robbins.,And I also avidly followed the Gemini,and the Apollo programs.,I had science projects and tons of astronomy,books. I took calculus and philosophy.,I wondered about the infinity,and the Big Bang theory.,And when I was at Stanford,,I found myself, my senior year,,chemical engineering major, half the folks,thought I was a political science and,performing arts major, which was sort of,true because I was Black Student Union President,and I did major in some other things,,and I found myself the last quarter juggling,chemical engineering separation processes,,logic classes, nuclear magnetic resonance,spectroscopy, and also producing,and choreographing a dance production,,and I had to do the lighting and the,design work, and I was trying to figure out,,do I go to New York City,to try to become a professional dancer,,or do I go to medical school?,Now, my mother helped me figure,that one out. (Laughter),But when I went into space,,when I went into space I carried a number,of things up with me. I carried a poster,by Alvin Ailey, which you can figure out,now, I love the dance company.,An Alvin Ailey poster of Judith Jamison,performing the dance "Cry," dedicated to all,black women everywhere. A Bundu statue,,which was from the Women's Society,in Sierra Leone, and a certificate for the,Chicago Public School students to work to,improve their science and math,,and folks asked me,,"Why did you take up what you took up?",And I had to say,,"Because it represents human creativity,,the creativity that allowed us, that we were,required to have to conceive and build,and launch the space shuttle, springs from,the same source as the imagination and,analysis it took to carve a Bundu statue,,or the ingenuity it took to design,,choreograph, and stage "Cry.",Each one of them are different,manifestations, incarnations, of creativity,,avatars of human creativity,,and that's what we have to reconcile,in our minds, how these things fit together.,The difference between arts and sciences,is not analytical versus intuitive, right?,E=MC squared required,an intuitive leap, and then you had,to do the analysis afterwards.,Einstein said, in fact, "The most beautiful,thing we can experience is the mysterious.,It is the source of all true art and science.",Dance requires us to express and want,to express the jubilation in life, but then you,have to figure out, exactly,what movement do I do to make sure,that it comes across correctly?,The difference between arts and sciences,is also not constructive versus,deconstructive, right? A lot of people,think of the sciences as deconstructive.,You have to pull things apart.,And yeah, sub-atomic physics,is deconstructive. You literally try to,tear atoms apart to understand,what's inside of them. But sculpture, from,what I understand from great sculptors,,is deconstructive, because you see a piece,and you remove what doesn't,need to be there.,Biotechnology is constructive.,Orchestral arranging is constructive.,So in fact we use constructive and,deconstructive techniques in everything.,The difference between science,and the arts is not that they,are different sides of the same coin, even,,or even different parts,of the same continuum, but rather,they're manifestations of the same thing.,Different quantum states of an atom?,Or maybe if I want to be more 21st century,I could say that they are different harmonic,resonances of a superstring.,But we'll leave that alone. (Laughter),They spring from the same source.,The arts and sciences are avatars of,human creativity. It's our attempt,as humans to build an understanding,of the universe, the world around us.,It's our attempt to influence things,,the universe internal to ourselves,and external to us.,The sciences, to me, are manifestations,of our attempt to express,or share our understanding,,our experience, to influence the universe,external to ourselves.,It doesn't rely on us as individuals.,It's the universe, as experienced,by everyone, and the arts manifest,our desire, our attempt to share,or influence others through experiences,that are peculiar to us as individuals.,Let me say it again another way:,science provides an understanding,of a universal experience, and,arts provides a universal understanding,of a personal experience.,That's what we have to think about,,that they're all part of us, they're,all part of a continuum.,It's not just the tools, it's not just,the sciences, you know, the mathematics,and the numerical stuff and the statistics,,because we heard, very much on this,stage, people talked about music,being mathematical. Right? Arts don't just,use clay, aren't the only ones that use clay,,light and sound and movement.,They use analysis as well.,So people might say, well,,I still like that intuitive versus analytical,thing, because everybody wants to do the,right brain, left brain thing, right?,We've all been accused of being,right-brained or left-brained at some point,in time, depending on who,we disagreed with. (Laughter),You know, people say intuitive, you know,that's like you're in touch with nature,,in touch with yourself and relationships.,Analytical: you put your mind to work, and,I'm going to tell you a little secret. You all,know this though, but sometimes people,use this analysis idea, that things are,outside of ourselves, to be, say, that this,is what we're going to elevate,as the true, most important sciences, right?,And then you have artists, and you all,know this is true as well,,artists will say things about scientists,because they say they're too concrete,,they're disconnected with the world.,But, we've even had that here on stage,,so don't act like you don't know,what I'm talking about. (Laughter),We had folks talking about the Flat Earth,Society and flower arrangers, so there's,this whole dichotomy that we continue,to carry along, even when we know better.,And folks say we need to choose either or.,But it would really be foolish to choose,either one, right?,Intuitive versus analytical?,That's a foolish choice. It's foolish,,just like trying to choose between,being realistic or idealistic.,You need both in life. Why do people,do this? I'm just gonna quote,a molecular biologist, Sydney Brenner,,who's 70 years old so he can say this. He said,,"It's always important to distinguish,between chastity and impotence.",Now... (Laughter),I want to share with you,a little equation, okay?,How do understanding science,and the arts fit into our lives,and what's going on and the things,that we're talking about here,at the design conference, and this is,a little thing I came up with, understanding,and our resources and our will,cause us to have outcomes.,Our understanding is our science, our arts,,our religion, how we see the universe,around us, our resources, our money,,our labor, our minerals, those things,that are out there in the world we have,to work with.,But more importantly, there's our will.,This is our vision, our aspirations,of the future, our hopes, our dreams,,our struggles and our fears.,Our successes and our failures influence,what we do with all of those, and to me,,design and engineering, craftsmanship and,skilled labor, are all the things that work on,this to have our outcome,,which is our human quality of life.,Where do we want the world to be?,And guess what?,Regardless of how we look at this, whether,we look at arts and sciences are separate,or different, they're both being influenced,now and they're both having problems.,I did a project called S.E.E.ing the Future:,Science, Engineering and Education, and,it was looking at how to shed light on,most effective use of government funding.,We got a bunch of scientists in all stages,of their careers. They came to Dartmouth,College, where I was teaching, and they,talked about with theologians and financiers,,what are some of the issues of public,funding for science and engineering,research? What's most important about it?,There are some ideas that emerged that,I think have really powerful parallels,to the arts. The first thing they said was that,the circumstances that we find ourselves in,today in the sciences and engineering that,made us world leaders is very different,than the '40s, the '50s, and the '60s,and the '70s when we emerged,as world leaders, because we're no longer,in competition with fascism, with,Soviet-style communism, and by the way,that competition wasn't just military,,it included social competition,and political competition as well,,that allowed us to look at space,as one of those platforms to prove,that our social system was better.,Another thing they talked about was the,infrastructure that supports the sciences,is becoming obsolete. We look at,universities and colleges, small, mid-sized,community colleges across the country,,their laboratories are becoming obsolete,,and this is where we train most of our,science workers and our researchers,,and our teachers, by the way,,and then that there's a media that doesn't,support the dissemination of any more than,the most mundane and inane of information.,There's pseudo-science, crop circles,,alien autopsy, haunted houses,,or disasters. And that's what we see.,And this isn't really the information,you need to operate in everyday life,and figure out how to participate in this,democracy and determine what's going on.,They also said that there's a change,in the corporate mentality. Whereas,government money had always been there,for basic science and engineering research,,we also counted on some companies to do,some basic research, but what's happened,now is companies put more energy into,short-term product development,than they do in basic engineering,and science research.,And education is not keeping up.,In K through 12, people are taking out,wet labs. They think if we put a computer,in the room it's going to take the place,of actually, we're mixing the acids,,we're growing the potatoes.,And government funding is decreasing,in spending and then they're saying,,let's have corporations take over,,and that's not true. Government funding,should at least do things like recognize,cost-benefits of basic science and,engineering research. We have to know,that we have a responsibility,as global citizens in this world.,We have to look at the education,of humans. We need to build our resources,today to make sure that they're trained so,that they understand the importance of,these things, and we have to support,the vitality of science, and that doesn't,mean that everything has to have one thing,that's going to go on, or we know,exactly what's going to be the outcome of it,,but that we support the vitality and the,intellectual curiosity that goes along,,and if you think about those parallels,to the arts, the competition,with the Bolshoi Ballet spurred,the Joffrey and the New York City Ballet,to become better.,Infrastructure museums, theaters,,movie houses across the country,are disappearing. We have more,television stations with less to watch,,we have more money spent on,rewrites to get old television programs,in the movies.,We have corporate funding now that,,when it goes to some company, when it,goes to support the arts, it almost requires,that the product be part of the picture,that the artist draws, and we have,stadiums that are named over and over,again by corporations.,In Houston, we're trying to figure out,what to do with that Enron Stadium thing.,(Laughter) And fine arts and education,in the schools is disappearing, and we have,a government that seems like it's gutting,the NEA and other programs,,so we have to really stop and think,,what are we trying to do,with the sciences and the arts?,There's a need to revitalize them.,We have to pay attention to it. I just want,to tell you really quickly what I'm doing.,(Applause),I want to tell you what I've been doing,a little bit since... I feel this need,to sort of integrate some of the ideas,that I've had and run across over time.,One of the things that I found out,is that there's a need to repair,the dichotomy between the mind and body,as well. My mother always told me,,you have to be observant, know what's,going on in your mind and your body,,and as a dancer I had this tremendous,faith in my ability to know my body,,just as I knew how to sense colors.,Then I went to medical school, and I was,supposed to just go on,what the machine said about bodies.,You know, you would ask patients,questions and some people would tell you,,"Don't, don't, don't listen to what,the patients said." We know that patients,know and understand their bodies better,,but these days we're trying to divorce them,from that idea. We have to reconcile the,patient's knowledge of their body,with physician's measurements.,We had someone talk about,measuring emotions and getting machines,to figure out what, to keep us,from acting crazy. Right?,No, we shouldn't measure,,we shouldn't use machines,to measure road rage and then do,something to keep us from engaging in it.,Maybe we can have machines help us,to recognize that we have road rage and,then we need to know how to control that,without the machines. We even need to be,able to recognize that without the machines.,What I'm very concerned about,is how do we bolster our self-awareness,as humans, as biological organisms?,Michael Moschen spoke of having to teach,and learn how to feel with my eyes,,to see with my hands.,We have all kinds of possibilities to use,our senses by, and that's,what we have to do.,That's what I want to do, is to try to use,bioinstrumentation, those kind of things,to help our senses in what we do,,and that's the work I've been doing now as,a company called BioSentient Corporation.,I figured I'd have to do that ad, because,I'm an entrepreneur, because entrepreneur,says that that's somebody who does what,they want to do because they're not broke,enough that they have to get a real job.,(Laughter) But that's the work I'm doing,with BioSentient Corporation trying to figure,out how do we integrate these things?,Let me finish by saying that,my personal design issue for the future,is really about integrating, to think about,that intuitive and that analytical.,The arts and sciences are not separate.,High school physics lesson before you,leave. High school physics teacher used to,hold up a ball. She would say this ball,has potential energy, but nothing,will happen to it, it can't do any work,until I drop it and it changes states.,I like to think of ideas as potential energy.,They're really wonderful, but nothing,will happen until we risk,putting them into action.,This conference is filled,with wonderful ideas.,We're going to share lots of things,with people, but nothing's going to happen,until we risk putting those ideas into action.,We need to revitalize the arts and sciences,of today, we need to take responsibility,for the future. We can't hide behind saying,it's just for company profits,,or it's just a business, or I'm an artist,or an academician.,Here's how you judge what you're doing.,I talked about that balance between,intuitive, analytical.,Fran Lebowitz, my favorite cynic,,she said the three questions,of greatest concern, now I'm going to,add on to design, is,,"Is it attractive?",That's the intuitive.,"Is it amusing?" The analytical.,"And does it know its place?",The balance. Thank you very much.,(Applause)♫ Like the heather ♫

 (Applause)One thing I wanted to say about film making is -- about this film --,in thinking about some of the wonderful talks we've heard here,,Michael Moschen, and some of the talks about music,,this idea that there is a narrative line,,and that music exists in time.,A film also exists in time; it's an experience,that you should go through emotionally.,And in making this film I felt that so many of the documentaries I've seen,were all about learning something,,or knowledge, or driven by talking heads, and driven by ideas.,And I wanted this film to be driven by emotions,,and really to follow my journey.,So instead of doing the talking head thing, instead it's composed of scenes,,and we meet people along the way.,We only meet them once.,They don't come back several times, so it really chronicles a journey.,It's something like life, that once you get in it,you can't get out. 
 There are two clips I want to show you,,the first one is a kind of hodgepodge,,its just three little moments, four little moments,with three of the people who are here tonight.,It's not the way they occur in the film,,because they are part of much larger scenes.,They play off each other in a wonderful way.,And that ends with a little clip of my father, of Lou,,talking about something that is very dear to him,,which is the accidents of life.,I think he felt that the greatest things in life were accidental,,and perhaps not planned at all.,And those three clips will be followed by a scene of,perhaps what, to me, is really his greatest building,which is a building in Dhaka, Bangladesh.,He built the capital over there.,And I think you'll enjoy this building, it's never been seen --,it's been still photographed, but never photographed by a film crew.,We were the first film crew in there. 
 So you'll see images of this remarkable building.,A couple of things to keep in mind when you see it,,it was built entirely by hand,,I think they got a crane the last year.,It was built entirely by hand off bamboo scaffolding,,people carrying these baskets of concrete on their heads,,dumping them in the forms.,It is the capital of the country,,and it took 23 years to build,,which is something they seem to be very proud of over there.,It took as long as the Taj Mahal.,Unfortunately it took so long that Lou never saw it finished.,He died in 1974.,The building was finished in 1983.,So it continued on for many years,after he died.,Think about that when you see that building,,that sometimes the things we strive for so hard in life we never get to see finished. 
 And that really struck me about my father,,in the sense that he had such belief,that somehow, doing these things,giving in the way that he gave, that something good would come out of it,,even in the middle of a war, there was a war with Pakistan at one point,,and the construction stopped totally and he kept working,,because he felt, "Well when the war is done,they'll need this building.",So, those are the two clips I'm going to show.,Roll that tape.,(Applause) 
 Richard Saul Wurman: I remember hearing him talk at Penn.,And I came home and I said to my father and mother,,"I just met this man: doesn't have much work,,and he's sort of ugly, funny voice,,and he's a teacher at school.,I know you've never heard of him, but just mark this day,that someday you will hear of him,,because he's really an amazing man." 
 Frank Gehry: I heard he had some kind of a fling with Ingrid Bergman. Is that true? 
 Nathaniel Kahn: If he did he was a very lucky man. 
 (Laughter) 
 NK: Did you hear that, really? 
 FG: Yeah, when he was in Rome. 
 Moshe Safdie: He was a real nomad.,And you know, when I knew him when I was in the office,,he would come in from a trip, and he would be in the office,for two or three days intensely, and he would pack up and go.,You know he'd be in the office till three in the morning working with us,and there was this kind of sense of the nomad in him.,I mean as tragic as his death was in a railway station,,it was so consistent with his life, you know?,I mean I often think I'm going to die in a plane,,or I'm going to die in an airport,,or die jogging without an identification on me.,I don't know why I sort of carry that,from that memory of the way he died.,But he was a sort of a nomad at heart. 
 Louis Kahn: How accidental our existences are really,and how full of influence by circumstance. 
 Man: We are the morning workers who come, all the time, here,and enjoy the walking, city's beauty and the atmosphere,and this is the nicest place of Bangladesh.,We are proud of it. 
 NK: You're proud of it? 
 Man: Yes, it is the national image of Bangladesh. 
 NK: Do you know anything about the architect? 
 Man: Architect? I've heard about him; he's a top-ranking architect. 
 NK: Well actually I'm here because I'm the architect's son,,he was my father. 
 Man: Oh! Dad is Louis Farrakhan? 
 NK: Yeah. No not Louis Farrakhan, Louis Kahn. 
 Man: Louis Kahn, yes! 
 (Laughter) 
 Man: Your father, is he alive? 
 NK: No, he's been dead for 25 years. 
 Man: Very pleased to welcome you back. 
 NK: Thank you. 
 NK: He never saw it finished, Pop.,No, he never saw this. 
 Shamsul Wares: It was almost impossible, building for a country like ours.,In 30, 50 years back, it was nothing, only paddy fields,,and since we invited him here,,he felt that he has got a responsibility.,He wanted to be a Moses here, he gave us democracy.,He is not a political man,,but in this guise he has given us,the institution for democracy, from where we can rise.,In that way it is so relevant.,He didn't care for how much money this country has,,or whether he would be able to ever finish this building,,but somehow he has been able to do it, build it, here.,And this is the largest project he has got in here, the poorest country in the world. 
 NK: It cost him his life. 
 SW: Yeah, he paid. He paid his life for this,,and that is why he is great and we'll remember him.,But he was also human.,Now his failure to satisfy the family life,,is an inevitable association of great people.,But I think his son will understand this,,and will have no sense of grudge,,or sense of being neglected, I think.,He cared in a very different manner,,but it takes a lot of time to understand that.,In social aspect of his life,he was just like a child, he was not at all matured.,He could not say no to anything,,and that is why, that he cannot say no to things,,we got this building today.,You see, only that way you can be able to understand him.,There is no other shortcut,,no other way to really understand him.,But I think he has given us this building,and we feel all the time for him,,that's why, he has given love for us.,He could not probably give the right kind of love for you,,but for us, he has given the people the right kind of love,,that is important.,You have to understand that.,He had an enormous amount of love,,he loved everybody.,To love everybody, he sometimes did not see,the very closest ones,,and that is inevitable for men of his stature. 
 (Applause)When I was five years old,I fell in love with airplanes.,Now I'm talking about the '30s.,In the '30s an airplane had two wings,and a round motor,,and was always flown,by a guy who looked like Cary Grant.,He had high leather boots,,jodhpurs, an old leather jacket,,a wonderful helmet,and those marvelous goggles --,and, inevitably, a white scarf,,to flow in the wind.,He'd always walk up to his airplane,in a kind of saunter,,devil-may-care saunter,,flick the cigarette away,,grab the girl waiting here, give her a kiss.,(Laughter),And then mount his airplane,,maybe for the last time.,Of course I always wondered what would happen,if he'd kissed the airplane first.,(Laughter) 
 But this was real romance to me.,Everything about flying in those years,,which was -- you have to stop and think for a moment --,was probably the most advanced,technological thing going on at the time.,So as a youngster,,I tried to get close to this,by drawing airplanes,,constantly drawing airplanes.,It's the way I got,a part of this romance.,And of course, in a way, when I say romance,,I mean in part,the aesthetics of that whole situation.,I think the word is the holistic experience,revolving around a product.,The product was that airplane.,But it built a romance.,Even the parts of the airplane,had French names.,Ze fuselage, ze empanage, ze nessal.,You know, from a romance language.,So that it was something that just got into your spirit.,It did mine. 
 And I decided I had to get closer than,just drawing fantasy airplanes.,I wanted to build airplanes.,So I built model airplanes.,And I found that in doing the model airplanes,the appearance drawings were not enough.,You couldn't transfer those,to the model itself.,If you wanted it to fly,you had to learn the discipline,of flying.,You had to learn about aeronautics.,You had to learn what made an airplane,stay in the air.,And of course, as a model in those years, you couldn't control it.,So it had to be self-righting,,and stay up without crashing.,So I had to give up,the approach of drawing,the fantasy shapes,and convert it to technical drawings --,the shape of the wing, the shape of the fuselage and so on --,and build an airplane over these drawings,that I knew followed some of the principles,of flying.,And in so doing, I could produce,a model that would fly, stay in the air.,And it had, once it was in the air,,some of this romance that I was in love with. 
 Well the act of drawing airplanes,led me to,,when I had the opportunity to choose,a course in school,,led me to sign up for aeronautical engineering.,And when I was sitting in classes --,in which no one asked me to draw an airplane --,to my surprise.,I had to learn mathematics and mechanics,and all this sort of thing.,I'd wile away my time drawing airplanes,in the class.,One day a young man looked over my shoulder,,he said, "You draw very well.,You should be in the art department.",And I said, "Why?",And he said, "Well for one thing, there are more girls there.",(Laughter) 
 So my romance was temporarily shifted.,(Laughter),And I went into art,because they appreciated drawing.,Studied painting; didn't do very well at that.,Went through design,,some architecture.,Eventually hired myself out as a designer.,And for the following 25 years,,living in Italy,,living in America,,I doled out a piece of this romance,to anybody who'd pay for it --,this sense, this aesthetic feeling,,for the experience revolving around,a designed object.,And it exists.,Any of you who rode the automobiles --,was it yesterday? --,at the track, you know the romance,revolving around those high performance cars. 
 Well in 25 years,I was mostly putting out,pieces of this romance,and not getting a lot back in,because design on call,doesn't always connect you with a circumstance,in which you can produce things of this nature.,So after 25 years I began to feel,as though I was running dry.,And I quit.,And I started up a very small operation --,went from 40 people,to one,,in an effort to rediscover my innocence.,I wanted to get back,where the romance was. 
 And I couldn't choose airplanes,because they had gotten sort of unromantic,at that point,,even though I'd done a lot of airplane work,,on the interiors.,So I chose furniture.,And I chose chairs specifically,because I knew something about them.,I'd designed a lot of chairs, over the years,for tractors and trucks,and submarines --,all kinds of things.,But not office chairs.,So I started doing that.,And I found that there were ways,to duplicate the same approach,that I used to use on the airplane.,Only this time,,instead of the product being shaped by the wind,,it was shaped by the human body.,So the discipline was --,as in the airplane you learn a lot about,how to deal with the air,,for a chair,you have to learn a lot about how to deal,with the body,,and what the body needs, wants,,indicates it needs.,And that's the way, ultimately,after some ups and downs,,I ended up designing the chair I'm going to show you. 
 I should say one more thing. When I was doing those,model airplanes,,I did everything.,I conceived the kind of airplane.,I basically engineered it.,I built it.,And I flew it.,And that's the way I work now.,When I started this chair,it was not a preconceived notion.,Design nowadays, if you mean it,,you don't start with styling sketches.,I started with a lot of loose ideas,,roughly eight or nine years ago.,And the loose ideas had something,to do with what I knew happened with,people in the office,,at the work place -- people who worked,,and used task seating,,a great many of them sitting in front of a computer,all day long.,And I felt,,the one thing they don't need,,is a chair that interferes,with their main reason for sitting there. 
 So I took the approach,that the chair should do as much for them,as humanly possible,or as mechanistically possible,so that they didn't have to fuss with it.,So my idea was that,,instead of sitting down and reaching,for a lot of controls,,that you would sit on the chair,,and it would automatically balance your weight,against the force required,to recline.,Now that may not mean a lot to some of you.,But you know most good chairs do recline,because it's beneficial to open up this joint,between your legs and your upper body,for better breathing,and better flow.,So that if you sit down,on my chair,,whether you're five feet tall,or six foot six,,it always deals with your weight,and transfers the amount of force required,to recline,in a way that you don't have to look,for something to adjust. 
 I'll tell you right up front,,this is a trade off.,There are drawbacks to this.,One is: you can't,accommodate everybody.,There are some very light people,,some extremely heavy people,,maybe people with a lot of bulk up top.,They begin to fall off the end of your chart.,But the compromise, I felt,,was in my favor,because most people don't adjust their chairs.,They will sit in them forever.,I had somebody on the bus out to the racetrack,tell me about his sister calling him.,He said she had one of the new, better chairs.,She said, "Oh I love it.",She said, "But it's too high.",(Laughter),So he said, "Well I'll come over and look at it.",He came over and looked at it.,He reached down. He pulled a lever. And the chair sank down.,She said, "Oh it's wonderful. How did you do that?",And he showed her the lever.,Well, that's typical,of a lot of us working in chairs.,And why should you,get a 20-page manual,about how to run a chair?,(Laughter),I had one for a wristwatch once. 20 pages. 
 Anyway, I felt that it was important,that you didn't have to make an adjustment,in order to get this kind of action.,The other thing I felt was that armrests,had never really been properly approached,from the standpoint of how much,of an aid they could be,to your work life.,But I felt it was too much to ask,to have to adjust each individual armrest,in order to get it where you wanted.,So I spent a long time.,I said I worked eight or nine years on it.,And each of these things went along,sort of in parallel,but incrementally were a problem of their own.,I worked a long time on figuring out,how to move the arms over a much greater arc --,that is up and down --,and make them a lot easier,,so that you didn't have to use a button.,And so after many trials, many failures,,we came up with a very simple arrangement,in which we could just move,one arm or the other.,And they go up easily.,And stop where you want.,You can put them down, essentially out of the way.,No arms at all.,Or you can pull them up where you want them.,And this was another thing that I felt,,while not nearly as romantic,as Cary Grant,,nevertheless begins to,grab a little bit of aesthetic,operation, aesthetic performance,into a product. 
 The next area that was of interest to me,was the fact that reclining,was a very important factor.,And the more you can recline,,in a way, the better it is.,The more the angle between here and here opens up --,and nowadays, with a screen in front of you,,you don't want to have your eye drop too far in the recline,,so we keep it at more or less the same level --,but you transfer weight,off your tailbones.,Would everybody put their hand under their bottom,and feel their tailbone?,(Laughter),You feel that bone under there?,(Laughter),Just your own.,(Laughter),There's two of them, one on either side.,All the weight of your upper torso --,your arms, your head --,goes right down through your back,,your spine, into those bones when you sit.,And that's a lot of load.,Just relieving your arms with armrests,takes 20 percent of that load off.,Now that, if your spine is not held in a good position,,will help bend your spine the wrong way, and so on.,So to unload,that great weight --,if that indeed exists --,you can recline.,When you recline you take away a lot of that load,off your bottom end, and transfer it to your back.,At the same time, as I say, you open up this joint.,And breathability is good. 
 But to do that, if you have any,amount of recline,,it gets to the point where you need a headrest,because nearly always,,automatically hold your head,in a vertical position, see?,As I recline, my head says more or less vertical.,Well if you're reclined a great deal,,you have to use muscle force,to hold your head there.,So that's where a headrest comes in.,Now headrest is a challenge,because you want it to adjust,enough so that it'll fit,,you know, a tall guy and a short girl.,So here we are.,I've got five inches of adjustment here,in order to get the headrest in the right place.,But then I knew from experience,and looking around in offices,where there were chairs with headrests,that nobody would ever bother,to reach back and turn a knob,and adjust the headrest to put it in position.,And you need it in a different position,when you're upright, then when you're reclined.,So I knew that had to be solved, and had to be automatic.,So if you watch this chair,as I recline, the headrest comes up,to meet my neck.,Ideally you want to put the head support,in the cranial area, right there.,So that part of it took a long time,to work out. 
 And there is a variety of other things: the shape of the cushions,,the gel we put.,We stole the idea from bicycle seats,,and put gel in the cushions,and in the armrests,to absorb point load --,distributes the loading so you don't get hard spots.,You cant hit your elbow,on bottom.,And I did want to demonstrate,the fact that the chair can accommodate people.,While you're sitting in it you can adjust it,down for the five-footer,,or you can adjust it,for the six-foot-six guy --,all within the scope of a few simple adjustments.,(Applause)(Music) 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. Ooh, I'm like, "Phew, phew, calm down. Get back into my body now." (Laughter) 
 Usually when I play out, the first thing that happens is,people scream out, "What's she doing?!",I'll play at these rock shows, be on stage,standing completely still, and they're like,,"What's she doing?! What's she doing?!",And then I'll kind of be like -- (Vvvwow!) -- and then they're like, "Whoa!",(Laughter) 
 I'm sure you're trying to figure out,,"Well, how does this thing work?",Well, what I'm doing is,controlling the pitch with my left hand.,See, the closer I get to this antenna, the higher the note gets --,(Portamento) --,and you can get it really low.,And with this hand I'm controlling the volume,,so the further away my right hand gets, the louder it gets.,(Tones),So basically, with both of your hands,you're controlling pitch and volume and kind of,trying to create the illusion that you're doing separate notes,,when really it's continuously going ...,(Flourish ... Beep),(Laughter) 
 Sometimes I startle myself: I'll forget that I have it on,,and I'll lean over to pick up something,,and then it goes like -- (Blip) -- "Oh!",And it's like a funny sound effect that follows you around,if you don't turn the thing off.,(Laughter) 
 Maybe we'll go into the next tune,,because I totally lost where this is going.,We're going to do a song by David Mash called "Listen: the Words Are Gone,",and maybe I'll have words come back into me afterwards if I can relax. 
 (Music) 
 (Applause) 
 So, I'm trying to think of some of the questions,that are commonly asked; there are so many.,And ... Well, I guess I could tell you,a little of the history of the theremin.,It was invented around the 1920s, and the inventor, Léon Theremin,-- he also was a musician besides an inventor --,he came up with the idea for making the theremin,,I think, when he was working on some shortwave radios.,And there'd be that sound in the signal -- it's like (Screeching) --,and he thought, "Oh, what if I could control that sound,and turn it into an instrument, because there are pitches in it.",And so somehow through developing that,,he eventually came to make the theremin the way it is now. 
 And a lot of times, even kids nowadays,,they'll make reference to a theremin by going, "Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo,",because in the '50s it was used in the sci-fi horror movies,,that sound that's like ... (Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo),(Laughter),It's kind of a funny, goofy sound to do. 
 And sometimes if I have too much coffee,,then my vibrato gets out of hand.,You're really sensitive to your body and its functions,when you're behind this thing.,You have to stay so still if you want to have the most control.,It reminds me of the balancing act earlier on -- what Michael was doing --,because you're fighting so hard to keep the balance,with what you're playing with and stay in tune, and at the same time,you don't want to focus so much on being in tune all the time;,you want to be feeling the music. 
 And then also, you're trying to stay very, very, very still,because little movements with other parts of your body,will affect the pitch, or sometimes if you're holding a low note -- (Tone rising out of key) --,and breathing will make it ... 
 (Laughter) 
 If I pass out on the next song ...,(Laughter) 
 I think of it almost like,like a yoga instrument because it makes you so aware,of every little crazy thing your body is doing,,or just aware of what you don't want it to be doing,while you're playing; you don't want to have any sudden movements.,And if I go to a club and play a gig, people are like,,"Here, have some drinks on us!",And it's like, "Well, I'm about to go on soon;,I don't want to be like -- (Teetering tones) -- you know?" 
 It really does reflect the mood that you're in also,,if you're ...,it's similar to being a vocalist, except,instead of it coming out of your throat,,you're controlling it just in the air,and you don't really have a point of reference;,you're always relying on your ears and adjusting constantly.,You just have to always adjust to what's happening,and realize you'll have bummer notes come here and there,and listen to it, adjust it, and just move on,,or else you'll get too tied up and go crazy. Like me. 
 I think we will play another tune now.,I'm going to do "Lush Life." It's one of my favorite tunes to play. 
 (Music) 
 (Applause)That splendid music, the coming-in music,,"The Elephant March" from "Aida,"nis the music I've chosen for my funeral. 
 (Laughter) 
 And you can see why. It's triumphal.,I won't feel anything, but if I could,,I would feel triumphalnat having lived at all,,and at having livednon this splendid planet,,and having been givennthe opportunity to understand,something about why I was herenin the first place, before not being here. 
 Can you understandnmy quaint English accent? 
 (Laughter) 
 Like everybody else, I was entrancednyesterday by the animal session.,Robert Full and Frans Lanting and others;,the beauty of the things that they showed.,The only slight jarring note was whennJeffrey Katzenberg said of the mustang,,"the most splendid creaturesnthat God put on this earth.",Now of course, we knownthat he didn't really mean that,,but in this country at the moment,nyou can't be too careful. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm a biologist, and the central theoremnof our subject: the theory of design,,Darwin's theory of evolutionnby natural selection.,In professional circles everywhere,nit's of course universally accepted.,In non-professional circlesnoutside America, it's largely ignored.,But in non-professionalncircles within America,,it arouses so much hostility -- 
 (Laughter) 
 it's fair to say that American biologistsnare in a state of war.,The war is so worrying at present,,with court cases comingnup in one state after another,,that I felt I had to saynsomething about it. 
 If you want to know what I havento say about Darwinism itself,,I'm afraid you're goingnto have to look at my books,,which you won't findnin the bookstore outside. 
 (Laughter) 
 Contemporary court cases,often concern an allegedlynnew version of creationism,,called "Intelligent Design," or ID.,Don't be fooled.nThere's nothing new about ID.,It's just creationism under another name,,rechristened --nI choose the word advisedly -- 
 (Laughter) 
 for tactical, political reasons. 
 The arguments of so-called ID theorists,are the same old argumentsnthat had been refuted again and again,,since Darwin down to the present day.,There is an effective evolution lobby,coordinating the fightnon behalf of science,,and I try to do all I can to help them,,but they get quite upsetnwhen people like me dare to mention,that we happen to be atheistsnas well as evolutionists.,They see us as rocking the boat,nand you can understand why.,Creationists, lacking any coherentnscientific argument for their case,,fall back on the popularnphobia against atheism:,Teach your childrennevolution in biology class,,and they'll soon move on to drugs,ngrand larceny and sexual "pre-version." 
 (Laughter) 
 In fact, of course, educatedntheologians from the Pope down,are firm in their support of evolution.,This book, "FindingnDarwin's God," by Kenneth Miller,,is one of the most effective attacksnon Intelligent Design that I know,and it's all the more effective becausenit's written by a devout Christian.,People like Kenneth Miller could be calledna "godsend" to the evolution lobby, 
 (Laughter) 
 because they expose the lienthat evolutionism is, as a matter of fact,,tantamount to atheism.,People like me, on the othernhand, rock the boat. 
 But here, I want to say somethingnnice about creationists.,It's not a thing I often do,nso listen carefully. 
 (Laughter) 
 I think they're right about one thing.,I think they're right that evolution,is fundamentally hostile to religion. 
 I've already said that many individualnevolutionists, like the Pope,,are also religious, but I thinknthey're deluding themselves.,I believe a truenunderstanding of Darwinism,is deeply corrosive to religious faith.,Now, it may sound as thoughnI'm about to preach atheism,,and I want to reassure younthat that's not what I'm going to do.,In an audiencenas sophisticated as this one,,that would be preaching to the choir. 
 No, what I want to urge upon you -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Instead, what I want to urgenupon you is militant atheism. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 But that's putting it too negatively.,If I was a person who were interestednin preserving religious faith,,I would be very afraid of the positivenpower of evolutionary science,,and indeed science generally,nbut evolution in particular,,to inspire and enthrall,nprecisely because it is atheistic. 
 Now, the difficult problemnfor any theory of biological design,is to explain the massive statisticalnimprobability of living things.,Statistical improbabilitynin the direction of good design --,"complexity" is another word for this.,The standard creationist argument --,there is only one;nthey're all reduced to this one --,takes off fromna statistical improbability.,Living creatures are too complexnto have come about by chance;,therefore, they must have had a designer.,This argument of course,nshoots itself in the foot.,Any designer capable of designingnsomething really complex,has to be even more complex himself,,and that's before we even startnon the other things he's expected to do,,like forgive sins, blessnmarriages, listen to prayers --,favor our side in a war -- 
 (Laughter) 
 disapprove of our sex lives, and so on. 
 (Laughter) 
 Complexity is the problemnthat any theory of biology has to solve,,and you can't solve it by postulatingnan agent that is even more complex,,thereby simply compounding the problem.,Darwinian natural selectionnis so stunningly elegant,because it solves the problemnof explaining complexity,in terms of nothing but simplicity.,Essentially, it does itnby providing a smooth ramp,of gradual, step-by-step increment.,But here, I only want to make the point,that the elegance of Darwinismnis corrosive to religion,,precisely because it is so elegant,nso parsimonious, so powerful,,so economically powerful.,It has the sinewy economynof a beautiful suspension bridge. 
 The God theory is not just a bad theory.,It turns out to be -- in principle --,incapable of doing the job required of it. 
 So, returning to tacticsnand the evolution lobby,,I want to argue that rocking the boat,may be just the right thing to do.,My approach to attacking creationism is --,unlike the evolution lobby --,my approach to attacking creationismnis to attack religion as a whole.,And at this point I neednto acknowledge the remarkable taboo,against speaking ill of religion,,and I'm going to do so in the wordsnof the late Douglas Adams,,a dear friend who,nif he never came to TED,,certainly should have been invited. 
 (Richard Saul Wurman: He was.) 
 Richard Dawkins: He was. Good.nI thought he must have been. 
 He begins this speech,nwhich was tape recorded in Cambridge,shortly before he died --,he begins by explaining how sciencenworks through the testing of hypotheses,that are framed to be vulnerablento disproof, and then he goes on. 
 I quote, "Religion doesn'tnseem to work like that.,It has certain ideas at the heart of it,nwhich we call 'sacred' or 'holy.',What it means is:nhere is an idea or a notion,that you're not allowednto say anything bad about.,You're just not. Why not?nBecause you're not." 
 (Laughter) 
 "Why should it benthat it's perfectly legitimate,to support the Republicans or Democrats,,this model of economics versus that,,Macintosh instead of Windows,,but to have an opinionnabout how the universe began,,about who created the universe --,no, that's holy.,So, we're used to notnchallenging religious ideas,,and it's very interesting how muchnof a furor Richard creates,when he does it." -- 
 He meant me, not that one. 
 "Everybody gets absolutelynfrantic about it,,because you're not allowednto say these things.,Yet when you look at it rationally,,there's no reason why those ideas,shouldn't be as opennto debate as any other,,except that we've agreednsomehow between us,that they shouldn't be." 
 And that's the endnof the quote from Douglas. 
 In my view, not only is sciencencorrosive to religion;,religion is corrosive to science.,It teaches peoplento be satisfied with trivial,,supernatural non-explanations,,and blinds them to the wonderful,nreal explanations,that we have within our grasp.,It teaches them to acceptnauthority, revelation and faith,,instead of always insisting on evidence. 
 There's Douglas Adams, magnificent picturenfrom his book, "Last Chance to See.",Now, there's a typical scientific journal,,The Quarterly Review of Biology.,And I'm going to putntogether, as guest editor,,a special issue on the question,n"Did an asteroid kill the dinosaurs?",And the first papernis a standard scientific paper,,presenting evidence,,"Iridium layer at the K-T boundary,,and potassium argon datedncrater in Yucatan,,indicate that an asteroidnkilled the dinosaurs.",Perfectly ordinary scientific paper.,Now, the next one.,"The President of the Royal Society,has been vouchsafedna strong inner conviction,that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs." 
 (Laughter) 
 "It has been privatelynrevealed to Professor Huxtane 
 that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs." 
 (Laughter) 
 "Professor Hordley was brought up,to have total and unquestioning faith" -- 
 (Laughter) -- 
 "that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs.","Professor Hawkins hasnpromulgated an official dogma,binding on all loyal Hawkinsians,that an asteroid killed the dinosaurs." 
 (Laughter) 
 That's inconceivable, of course. 
 But suppose -- 
 [Supporters of the Asteroid Theoryncannot be patriotic citizens] 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 In 1987, a reporter asked George Bush, Sr.,whether he recognizednthe equal citizenship and patriotism,of Americans who are atheists.,Mr. Bush's reply has become infamous.,"No, I don't know that atheistsnshould be considered citizens,,nor should they be considered patriots.,This is one nation under God." 
 Bush's bigotrynwas not an isolated mistake,,blurted out in the heatnof the moment and later retracted.,He stood by it in the face of repeatedncalls for clarification or withdrawal.,He really meant it.,More to the point, he knewnit posed no threat to his election --,quite the contrary.,Democrats as well as Republicansnparade their religiousness,if they want to get elected.,Both parties invoken"one nation under God.",What would Thomas Jefferson have said? 
 [In every country and in every age,nthe priest has been hostile to liberty] 
 Incidentally, I'm not usuallynvery proud of being British,,but you can't help making the comparison. 
 (Applause) 
 In practice, what is an atheist?,An atheist is just somebodynwho feels about Yahweh,the way any decent Christian feelsnabout Thor or Baal or the golden calf.,As has been said before, we arenall atheists about most of the gods,that humanity has ever believed in.,Some of us just go one god further. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 And however we define atheism,nit's surely the kind of academic belief,that a person is entitlednto hold without being vilified,as an unpatriotic,nunelectable non-citizen.,Nevertheless, it's an undeniable factnthat to own up to being an atheist,is tantamount to introducing yourselfnas Mr. Hitler or Miss Beelzebub.,And that all stemsnfrom the perception of atheists,as some kind of weird, way-out minority. 
 Natalie Angier wrote a rathernsad piece in the New Yorker,,saying how lonely she felt as an atheist.,She clearly feelsnin a beleaguered minority.,But actually, how do American atheistsnstack up numerically?,The latest survey makesnsurprisingly encouraging reading.,Christianity, of course, takes a massivenlion's share of the population,,with nearly 160 million.,But what would you thinknwas the second largest group,,convincingly outnumbering Jewsnwith 2.8 million, Muslims at 1.1 million,,Hindus, Buddhists and all othernreligions put together?,The second largest group,nwith nearly 30 million,,is the one describednas non-religious or secular. 
 You can't help wonderingnwhy vote-seeking politicians,are so proverbially overawed by the powernof, for example, the Jewish lobby --,the state of Israel seems to owe its verynexistence to the American Jewish vote --,while at the same time,,consigning the non-religiousnto political oblivion.,This secular non-religious vote,nif properly mobilized,,is nine times as numerousnas the Jewish vote.,Why does this far morensubstantial minority,not make a move to exercisenits political muscle? 
 Well, so much for quantity.nHow about quality?,Is there any correlation,npositive or negative,,between intelligencenand tendency to be religious? 
 [Them folks misunderestimated me] 
 (Laughter) 
 The survey that I quoted,nwhich is the ARIS survey,,didn't break down its datanby socio-economic class or education,,IQ or anything else.,But a recent article by Paul G. Bellnin the Mensa magazine,provides some straws in the wind.,Mensa, as you know,nis an international organization,for people with very high IQ.,And from a meta-analysisnof the literature,,Bell concludes that, I quote --n"Of 43 studies carried out since 1927,on the relationshipnbetween religious belief,,and one's intelligencenor educational level,,all but four found an inverse connection.,That is, the higher one's intelligencenor educational level,,the less one is likely to be religious.",Well, I haven't seennthe original 42 studies,,and I can't comment on that meta-analysis,,but I would like to see morenstudies done along those lines.,And I know that there are --nif I could put a little plug here --,there are people in this audience,easily capable of financing a massivenresearch survey to settle the question,,and I put the suggestion up,nfor what it's worth. 
 But let me know show you some data,that have been properlynpublished and analyzed,,on one special group --nnamely, top scientists.,In 1998, Larson and Withamnpolled the cream of American scientists,,those who'd been honored by electionnto the National Academy of Sciences,,and among this select group,,belief in a personal God droppednto a shattering seven percent.,About 20 percent are agnostic;nthe rest could fairly be called atheists.,Similar figures obtainednfor belief in personal immortality.,Among biological scientists,nthe figure is even lower:,5.5 percent, only, believe in God.,Physical scientists, it's 7.5 percent.,I've not seen correspondingnfigures for elite scholars,in other fields,nsuch as history or philosophy,,but I'd be surprisednif they were different. 
 So, we've reached a trulynremarkable situation,,a grotesque mismatchnbetween the American intelligentsia,and the American electorate.,A philosophical opinionnabout the nature of the universe,,which is held by the vast majoritynof top American scientists,and probably the majoritynof the intelligentsia generally,,is so abhorrent to the American electorate,that no candidate for popular electionndare affirm it in public.,If I'm right, this means that high office,in the greatest country in the world,is barred to the very peoplenbest qualified to hold it --,the intelligentsia --,unless they are preparednto lie about their beliefs.,To put it bluntly:nAmerican political opportunities,are heavily loaded against those,who are simultaneouslynintelligent and honest. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 I'm not a citizen of this country,nso I hope it won't be thought unbecoming,if I suggest that somethingnneeds to be done. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I've already hintednwhat that something is.,From what I've seen of TED, I think thisnmay be the ideal place to launch it.,Again, I fear it will cost money.,We need a consciousness-raising,,coming-out campaign for American atheists. 
 (Laughter) 
 This could be similar to the campaignnorganized by homosexuals,a few years ago,,although heaven forbidnthat we should stoop to public outing,of people against their will.,In most cases, people who out themselves,will help to destroy the myth thatnthere is something wrong with atheists. 
 On the contrary,,they'll demonstrate that atheistsnare often the kinds of people,who could serve as decentnrole models for your children,,the kinds of people an advertising agentncould use to recommend a product,,the kinds of peoplenwho are sitting in this room.,There should be a snowball effect,na positive feedback,,such that the more namesnwe have, the more we get.,There could be non-linearities,nthreshold effects.,When a critical mass has been obtained,,there's an abruptnacceleration in recruitment.,And again, it will need money. 
 I suspect that the word "atheist" itself,contains or remains a stumbling block,far out of proportionnto what it actually means,,and a stumbling block to people,who otherwise might benhappy to out themselves.,So, what other words mightnbe used to smooth the path,,oil the wheels, sugar the pill?,Darwin himself preferred "agnostic" --,and not only out of loyaltynto his friend Huxley,,who coined the term. 
 Darwin said, "I have never been an atheist,in the same sense of denyingnthe existence of a God.,I think that generally an 'agnostic',would be the most correctndescription of my state of mind." 
 He even became uncharacteristicallyntetchy with Edward Aveling.,Aveling was a militant atheist,who failed to persuade Darwin,to accept the dedicationnof his book on atheism --,incidentally, giving risento a fascinating myth,that Karl Marx tried to dedicaten"Das Kapital" to Darwin,,which he didn't, it wasnactually Edward Aveling.,What happened was that Aveling'snmistress was Marx's daughter,,and when both Darwin and Marx were dead,,Marx's papers became muddlednup with Aveling's papers,,and a letter from Darwin saying,n"My dear sir, thank you very much,but I don't want younto dedicate your book to me,",was mistakenly supposednto be addressed to Marx,,and that gave rise to this wholenmyth, which you've probably heard.,It's a sort of urban myth, that Marxntried to dedicate "Kapital" to Darwin. 
 Anyway, it was Aveling, and whennthey met, Darwin challenged Aveling.,"Why do you call yourselves atheists?","'Agnostic, '" retorted Aveling, "wasnsimply 'atheist' writ respectable,,and 'atheist' was simplyn'agnostic' writ aggressive.",Darwin complained, "But whynshould you be so aggressive?",Darwin thought that atheism might benwell and good for the intelligentsia,,but that ordinary people werennot, quote, "ripe for it.",Which is, of course, our old friend,nthe "don't rock the boat" argument.,It's not recorded whether Aveling toldnDarwin to come down off his high horse. 
 (Laughter) 
 But in any case,nthat was more than 100 years ago.,You'd think we might havengrown up since then.,Now, a friend, an intelligent lapsed Jew,,who, incidentally, observes the Sabbathnfor reasons of cultural solidarity,,describes himselfnas a "tooth-fairy agnostic.",He won't call himself an atheist,because it's, in principle,nimpossible to prove a negative,,but "agnostic" on its own mightnsuggest that God's existence,was therefore on equal termsnof likelihood as his non-existence. 
 So, my friend is strictlynagnostic about the tooth fairy,,but it isn't very likely, is it?,Like God.,Hence the phrase, "tooth-fairy agnostic.",Bertrand Russell made the same point,using a hypothetical teapotnin orbit about Mars.,You would strictly have to be agnostic,about whether there is a teapotnin orbit about Mars,,but that doesn't mean you treatnthe likelihood of its existence,as on all fours with its non-existence. 
 The list of things which we strictlynhave to be agnostic about,doesn't stop at tooth fairiesnand teapots; it's infinite.,If you want to believenone particular one of them --,unicorns or tooth fairiesnor teapots or Yahweh --,the onus is on you to say why.,The onus is not on the restnof us to say why not.,We, who are atheists,,are also a-fairyists and a-teapotists. 
 (Laughter) 
 But we don't bother to say so.,And this is why my friendnuses "tooth-fairy agnostic",as a label for what most peoplenwould call atheist.,Nonetheless, if we want to attractndeep-down atheists to come out publicly,,we're going to have findnsomething better to stick on our banner,than "tooth-fairy" or "teapot agnostic." 
 So, how about "humanist"?,This has the advantage of a worldwidennetwork of well-organized associations,and journals and things already in place.,My problem with it is onlynits apparent anthropocentrism.,One of the thingsnwe've learned from Darwin,is that the human species is only one,among millions of cousins,nsome close, some distant. 
 And there are other possibilities,nlike "naturalist,",but that also has problems of confusion,,because Darwin would haventhought naturalist --,"Naturalist" means, of course,nas opposed to "supernaturalist" --,and it is used sometimes --,Darwin would have been confusednby the other sense of "naturalist,",which he was, of course,,and I suppose there might be othersnwho would confuse it with "nudism". 
 (Laughter) 
 Such people might be thosenbelonging to the British lynch mob,,which last year attacked a pediatriciannin mistake for a pedophile. 
 (Laughter) 
 I think the best of the availablenalternatives for "atheist",is simply "non-theist.",It lacks the strong connotationnthat there's definitely no God,,and it could therefore easily be embracednby teapot or tooth-fairy agnostics.,It's completely compatiblenwith the God of the physicists.,When atheists like Stephen Hawkingnand Albert Einstein use the word "God,",they use it of coursenas a metaphorical shorthand,for that deep, mysterious part of physicsnwhich we don't yet understand.,"Non-theist" will do for all that,nyet unlike "atheist,",it doesn't have the samenphobic, hysterical responses.,But I think, actually, the alternative,is to grasp the nettlenof the word "atheism" itself,,precisely because it is a taboo word,,carrying frissons of hysterical phobia.,Critical mass may be hardernto achieve with the word "atheist",than with the word "non-theist,",or some other non-confrontational word.,But if we did achieve itnwith that dread word "atheist" itself,,the political impactnwould be even greater. 
 Now, I said that if I were religious,nI'd be very afraid of evolution --,I'd go further: I would fear sciencenin general, if properly understood.,And this is becausenthe scientific worldview,is so much more exciting, more poetic,,more filled with sheer wonder,than anything in the poverty-strickennarsenals of the religious imagination.,As Carl Sagan, another recentlyndead hero, put it,,"How is it that hardly any majornreligion has looked at science,and concluded, 'Thisnis better than we thought!,The universe is much biggernthan our prophet said,,grander, more subtle, more elegant'?,Instead they say, 'No, no, no!,My god is a little god,nand I want him to stay that way.',A religion, old or new,,that stressed the magnificencenof the universe,as revealed by modern science,,might be able to draw forthnreserves of reverence and awe,hardly tapped by the conventional faiths." 
 Now, this is an elite audience,,and I would therefore expectnabout 10 percent of you to be religious.,Many of you probably subscribento our polite cultural belief,that we should respect religion.,But I also suspectnthat a fair number of those,secretly despise religion as much as I do. 
 (Laughter) 
 If you're one of them, and of coursenmany of you may not be,,but if you are one of them,,I'm asking you to stop being polite,,come out, and say so.,And if you happen to be rich,,give some thought to waysnin which you might make a difference.,The religious lobby in this country,is massively financed by foundations --nto say nothing of all the tax benefits --,by foundations, such as the TempletonnFoundation and the Discovery Institute.,We need an anti-Templeton to step forward.,If my books sold as wellnas Stephen Hawking's books,,instead of only as well asnRichard Dawkins' books, I'd do it myself. 
 People are always going on about,n"How did September the 11th change you?" 
 Well, here's how it changed me. 
 Let's all stop being so damned respectful. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Welcome. If I could have the first slide, please?,Contrary to calculations made by some engineers, bees can fly,,dolphins can swim, and geckos can even climb,up the smoothest surfaces. Now, what I want to do, in the short time I have,,is to try to allow each of you to experience,the thrill of revealing nature's design.,I get to do this all the time, and it's just incredible.,I want to try to share just a little bit of that with you in this presentation.,The challenge of looking at nature's designs --,and I'll tell you the way that we perceive it, and the way we've used it.,The challenge, of course, is to answer this question:,what permits this extraordinary performance of animals,that allows them basically to go anywhere?,And if we could figure that out, how can we implement those designs? 
 Well, many biologists will tell engineers, and others,,organisms have millions of years to get it right;,they're spectacular; they can do everything wonderfully well.,So, the answer is bio-mimicry: just copy nature directly.,We know from working on animals that the truth is,that's exactly what you don't want to do -- because evolution works,on the just-good-enough principle, not on a perfecting principle.,And the constraints in building any organism, when you look at it,,are really severe. Natural technologies have incredible constraints.,Think about it. If you were an engineer and I told you,that you had to build an automobile, but it had to start off to be this big,,then it had to grow to be full size and had to work every step along the way.,Or think about the fact that if you build an automobile, I'll tell you that you also -- inside it --,have to put a factory that allows you to make another automobile. 
 (Laughter) 
 And you can absolutely never, absolutely never, because of history,and the inherited plan, start with a clean slate.,So, organisms have this important history.,Really evolution works more like a tinkerer than an engineer.,And this is really important when you begin to look at animals.,Instead, we believe you need to be inspired by biology.,You need to discover the general principles of nature,,and then use these analogies when they're advantageous.,This is a real challenge to do this, because animals,,when you start to really look inside them -- how they work --,appear hopelessly complex. There's no detailed history,of the design plans, you can't go look it up anywhere.,They have way too many motions for their joints, too many muscles.,Even the simplest animal we think of, something like an insect,,and they have more neurons and connections than you can imagine. 
 How can you make sense of this? Well, we believed --,and we hypothesized -- that one way animals could work simply,,is if the control of their movements,tended to be built into their bodies themselves.,What we discovered was that two-, four-, six- and eight-legged animals,all produce the same forces on the ground when they move.,They all work like this kangaroo, they bounce.,And they can be modeled by a spring-mass system that we call the spring mass system,because we're biomechanists. It's actually a pogo stick.,They all produce the pattern of a pogo stick. How is that true?,Well, a human, one of your legs works like two legs of a trotting dog,,or works like three legs, together as one, of a trotting insect,,or four legs as one of a trotting crab.,And then they alternate in their propulsion,,but the patterns are all the same. Almost every organism we've looked at this way,-- you'll see next week, I'll give you a hint,,there'll be an article coming out that says that really big things,like T. rex probably couldn't do this, but you'll see that next week. 
 Now, what's interesting is the animals, then -- we said -- bounce along,the vertical plane this way, and in our collaborations with Pixar,,in "A Bug's Life," we discussed the,bipedal nature of the characters of the ants.,And we told them, of course, they move in another plane as well.,And they asked us this question. They say, "Why model,just in the sagittal plane or the vertical plane,,when you're telling us these animals are moving,in the horizontal plane?" This is a good question.,Nobody in biology ever modeled it this way.,We took their advice and we modeled the animals moving,in the horizontal plane as well. We took their three legs,,we collapsed them down as one.,We got some of the best mathematicians in the world,from Princeton to work on this problem.,And we were able to create a model,where animals are not only bouncing up and down,,but they're also bouncing side to side at the same time.,And many organisms fit this kind of pattern.,Now, why is this important to have this model?,Because it's very interesting. When you take this model,and you perturb it, you give it a push,,as it bumps into something, it self-stabilizes, with no brain,or no reflexes, just by the structure alone.,It's a beautiful model. Let's look at the mathematics. 
 (Laughter) 
 That's enough! 
 (Laughter) 
 The animals, when you look at them running,,appear to be self-stabilizing like this,,using basically springy legs. That is, the legs can do,computations on their own; the control algorithms, in a sense,,are embedded in the form of the animal itself.,Why haven't we been more inspired by nature and these kinds of discoveries?,Well, I would argue that human technologies are really different from,natural technologies, at least they have been so far.,Think about the typical kind of robot that you see.,Human technologies have tended to be large, flat,,with right angles, stiff, made of metal. They have rolling devices,and axles. There are very few motors, very few sensors.,Whereas nature tends to be small, and curved,,and it bends and twists, and has legs instead, and appendages,,and has many muscles and many, many sensors.,So it's a very different design. However, what's changing,,what's really exciting -- and I'll show you some of that next --,is that as human technology takes on more of the characteristics,of nature, then nature really can become a much more useful teacher. 
 And here's one example that's really exciting.,This is a collaboration we have with Stanford.,And they developed this new technique, called Shape Deposition Manufacturing.,It's a technique where they can mix materials together and mold any shape,that they like, and put in the material properties.,They can embed sensors and actuators right in the form itself.,For example, here's a leg: the clear part is stiff,,the white part is compliant, and you don't need any axles there or anything.,It just bends by itself beautifully.,So, you can put those properties in. It inspired them to show off,this design by producing a little robot they named Sprawl.,Our work has also inspired another robot, a biologically inspired bouncing robot,,from the University of Michigan and McGill,named RHex, for robot hexapod, and this one's autonomous.,Let's go to the video, and let me show you some of these animals moving,and then some of the simple robots,that have been inspired by our discoveries.,Here's what some of you did this morning, although you did it outside,,not on a treadmill.,Here's what we do. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is a death's head cockroach. This is an American cockroach,you think you don't have in your kitchen.,This is an eight-legged scorpion, six-legged ant, forty-four-legged centipede.,Now, I said all these animals are sort of working like pogo sticks --,they're bouncing along as they move. And you can see that,in this ghost crab, from the beaches of Panama and North Carolina.,It goes up to four meters per second when it runs.,It actually leaps into the air, and has aerial phases,when it does it, like a horse, and you'll see it's bouncing here.,What we discovered is whether you look at the leg of a human,like Richard, or a cockroach, or a crab, or a kangaroo,,the relative leg stiffness of that spring is the same for everything we've seen so far.,Now, what good are springy legs then? What can they do?,Well, we wanted to see if they allowed the animals,to have greater stability and maneuverability.,So, we built a terrain that had obstacles three times the hip height,of the animals that we're looking at.,And we were certain they couldn't do this. And here's what they did.,The animal ran over it and it didn't even slow down!,It didn't decrease its preferred speed at all.,We couldn't believe that it could do this. It said to us,that if you could build a robot with very simple, springy legs,,you could make it as maneuverable as any that's ever been built. 
 Here's the first example of that. This is the Stanford,Shape Deposition Manufactured robot, named Sprawl.,It has six legs -- there are the tuned, springy legs.,It moves in a gait that an insect uses, and here it is,going on the treadmill. Now, what's important about this robot,,compared to other robots, is that it can't see anything,,it can't feel anything, it doesn't have a brain, yet it can maneuver,over these obstacles without any difficulty whatsoever.,It's this technique of building the properties into the form.,This is a graduate student. This is what he's doing to his thesis project --,very robust, if a graduate student,does that to his thesis project. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is from McGill and University of Michigan. This is the RHex,,making its first outing in a demo. 
 (Laughter) 
 Same principle: it only has six moving parts,,six motors, but it has springy, tuned legs. It moves in the gait of the insect.,It has the middle leg moving in synchrony with the front,,and the hind leg on the other side. Sort of an alternating tripod,,and they can negotiate obstacles just like the animal. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Voice: Oh my God.) 
 (Applause) 
 Robert Full: It'll go on different surfaces -- here's sand --,although we haven't perfected the feet yet, but I'll talk about that later.,Here's RHex entering the woods. 
 (Laughter) 
 Again, this robot can't see anything, it can't feel anything,,it has no brain. It's just working with a tuned mechanical system,,with very simple parts, but inspired from the fundamental dynamics of the animal.,(Voice: Ah, I love him, Bob.) RF: Here's it going down a pathway.,I presented this to the jet propulsion lab at NASA, and they said,that they had no ability to go down craters to look for ice,,and life, ultimately, on Mars. And he said --,especially with legged-robots, because they're way too complicated.,Nothing can do that. And I talk next. I showed them this video,with the simple design of RHex here. And just to convince them,we should go to Mars in 2011, I tinted the video orange,just to give them the sense of being on Mars. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Another reason why animals have extraordinary performance,,and can go anywhere, is because they have an effective interaction,with the environment. The animal I'm going to show you,,that we studied to look at this, is the gecko.,We have one here and notice its position. It's holding on.,Now I'm going to challenge you. I'm going show you a video.,One of the animals is going to be running on the level,,and the other one's going to be running up a wall. Which one's which?,They're going at a meter a second. How many think the one on the left,is running up the wall? 
 (Applause) 
 Okay. The point is it's really hard to tell, isn't it? It's incredible,,we looked at students do this and they couldn't tell.,They can run up a wall at a meter a second, 15 steps per second,,and they look like they're running on the level. How do they do this?,It's just phenomenal. The one on the right was going up the hill.,How do they do this? They have bizarre toes. They have toes,that uncurl like party favors when you blow them out,,and then peel off the surface, like tape.,Like if we had a piece of tape now, we'd peel it this way.,They do this with their toes. It's bizarre! This peeling inspired,iRobot -- that we work with -- to build Mecho-Geckos.,Here's a legged version and a tractor version, or a bulldozer version.,Let's see some of the geckos move with some video,,and then I'll show you a little bit of a clip of the robots.,Here's the gecko running up a vertical surface. There it goes,,in real time. There it goes again. Obviously, we have to slow this down a little bit. 
 You can't use regular cameras.,You have to take 1,000 pictures per second to see this.,And here's some video at 1,000 frames per second.,Now, I want you to look at the animal's back.,Do you see how much it's bending like that? We can't figure that out --,that's an unsolved mystery. We don't know how it works.,If you have a son or a daughter that wants to come to Berkeley,,come to my lab and we'll figure this out. Okay, send them to Berkeley,because that's the next thing I want to do. Here's the gecko mill. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's a see-through treadmill with a see-through treadmill belt,,so we can watch the animal's feet, and videotape them,through the treadmill belt, to see how they move.,Here's the animal that we have here, running on a vertical surface.,Pick a foot and try to watch a toe, and see if you can see what the animal's doing.,See it uncurl and then peel these toes.,It can do this in 14 milliseconds. It's unbelievable.,Here are the robots that they inspire, the Mecho-Geckos from iRobot.,First we'll see the animals toes peeling -- look at that.,And here's the peeling action of the Mecho-Gecko.,It uses a pressure-sensitive adhesive to do it.,Peeling in the animal. Peeling in the Mecho-Gecko --,that allows them climb autonomously. Can go on the flat surface,,transition to a wall, and then go onto a ceiling.,There's the bulldozer version. Now, it doesn't use pressure-sensitive glue.,The animal does not use that.,But that's what we're limited to, at the moment. 
 What does the animal do? The animal has weird toes.,And if you look at the toes, they have these little leaves there,,and if you blow them up and zoom in, you'll see,that's there's little striations in these leaves.,And if you zoom in 270 times, you'll see it looks like a rug.,And if you blow that up, and zoom in 900 times,,you see there are hairs there, tiny hairs. And if you look carefully,,those tiny hairs have striations. And if you zoom in on those 30,000 times,,you'll see each hair has split ends.,And if you blow those up, they have these little structures on the end.,The smallest branch of the hairs looks like spatulae,,and an animal like that has one billion of these nano-size split ends,,to get very close to the surface. In fact, there's the diameter of your hair --,a gecko has two million of these, and each hair has 100 to 1,000 split ends.,Think of the contact of that that's possible. 
 We were fortunate to work with another group,at Stanford that built us a special manned sensor,,that we were able to measure the force of an individual hair.,Here's an individual hair with a little split end there.,When we measured the forces, they were enormous.,They were so large that a patch of hairs about this size --,the gecko's foot could support the weight of a small child,,about 40 pounds, easily. Now, how do they do it?,We've recently discovered this. Do they do it by friction?,No, force is too low. Do they do it by electrostatics?,No, you can change the charge -- they still hold on.,Do they do it by interlocking? That's kind of a like a Velcro-like thing.,No, you can put them on molecular smooth surfaces -- they don't do it.,How about suction? They stick on in a vacuum.,How about wet adhesion? Or capillary adhesion?,They don't have any glue, and they even stick under water just fine.,If you put their foot under water, they grab on.,How do they do it then? Believe it or not, they grab on,by intermolecular forces, by Van der Waals forces. 
 You know, you probably had this a long time ago in chemistry,,where you had these two atoms, they're close together,,and the electrons are moving around. That tiny force is sufficient,to allow them to do that because it's added up so many times,with these small structures.,What we're doing is, we're taking that inspiration of the hairs,,and with another colleague at Berkeley, we're manufacturing them.,And just recently we've made a breakthrough, where we now believe,we're going to be able to create the first synthetic, self-cleaning,,dry adhesive. Many companies are interested in this. 
 (Laughter) 
 We also presented to Nike even. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 We'll see where this goes. We were so excited about this,that we realized that that small-size scale --,and where everything gets sticky, and gravity doesn't matter anymore --,we needed to look at ants and their feet, because,one of my other colleagues at Berkeley has built a six-millimeter silicone,robot with legs. But it gets stuck. It doesn't move very well.,But the ants do, and we'll figure out why, so that ultimately,we'll make this move. And imagine: you're going to be able,to have swarms of these six-millimeter robots available to run around.,Where's this going? I think you can see it already. 
 Clearly, the Internet is already having eyes and ears,,you have web cams and so forth. But it's going to also have legs and hands.,You're going to be able to do programmable,work through these kinds of robots, so that you can run,,fly and swim anywhere. We saw David Kelly is at the beginning of that with his fish.,So, in conclusion, I think the message is clear.,If you need a message, if nature's not enough, if you care about,search and rescue, or mine clearance, or medicine,,or the various things we're working on, we must preserve,nature's designs, otherwise these secrets will be lost forever.,Thank you. 
 (Applause)The advances that have taken place in astronomy,,cosmology and biology, in the last 10 years,,are really extraordinary --,to the point where we know more about our universe and how it works,than many of you might imagine.,But there was something else that I've noticed,as those changes were taking place, as people were starting to find out that,hmm ... yeah, there really is a black hole at the center of every galaxy.,The science writers and editors -- I shouldn't say science writers,,I should say people who write about science --,and editors would sit down over a couple of beers,,after a hard day of work, and start talking about,some of these incredible perceptions about how the universe works. 
 And they would inevitably end up in what I thought was a very bizarre place,,which is ways the world could end very suddenly.,And that's what I want to talk about today. (Laughter),Ah, you laugh, you fools. (Laughter) 
 (Voice: Can we finish up a little early?) 
 (Laughter) Yeah, we need the time!,Stephen Petranek: At first, it all seemed a little fantastical to me, but after challenging a lot of these ideas,,I began to take a lot of them seriously. And then September 11 happened,,and I thought, ah, God,,I can't go to the TED conference and talk about how the world is going to end.,Nobody wants to hear that. Not after this!,And that got me into a discussion with some other people, other scientists,,about maybe some other subjects, and one of the guys I talked to,,who was a neuroscientist, said,,"You know, I think there are a lot of solutions to the problems you brought up,",and reminds me of Michael's talk yesterday,and his mother saying you can't have a solution if you don't have a problem.,So, we went out looking for solutions to ways that the world might end tomorrow,,and lo and behold, we found them.,Which leads me to a videotape of a President Bush,press conference from a couple of weeks ago.,Can we run that, Andrew? 
 President George W. Bush: Whatever it costs to defend our security,,and whatever it costs to defend our freedom, we must pay it. 
 SP: I agree with the president.,He wants two trillion dollars to protect us from terrorists next year,,a two-trillion-dollar federal budget, which will land us back into deficit spending real fast.,But terrorists aren't the only threat we face.,There are really serious calamities staring us in the eye,that we're in the same kind of denial about,that we were about terrorism, and what could've happened on September 11. 
 I would propose, therefore, that if we took 10 billion dollars,from that 2.13 trillion dollar budget --,which is two one hundredths of that budget --,and we doled out a billion dollars to each one of these problems,I'm going to talk to you about, the vast majority could be solved,,and the rest we could deal with. So, I hope you find this both fascinating --,I'm fascinated by this kind of stuff, I gotta admit --,to me these are Richard's cockroaches. 
 But I also hope, because I think the people in this room can literally change the world,,I hope you take some of this stuff away with you,,and when you have an opportunity to be influential,,that you try to get some heavy-duty money spent on some of these ideas. 
 So let's start. Number 10: we lose the will to survive.,We live in an incredible age of modern medicine.,We are all much healthier than we were 20 years ago.,People around the world are getting better medicine --,but mentally, we're falling apart.,The World Health Organization now estimates,that one out of five people on the planet is clinically depressed.,And the World Health Organization also says that depression is the,biggest epidemic that humankind has ever faced. 
 Soon, genetic breakthroughs and even better medicine,are going to allow us to think of 100 as a normal lifespan.,A female child born tomorrow, on average -- median -- will live to age 83.,Our life longevity is going up almost a year for every year that passes.,Now the problem with all of this, getting older,,is that people over 65 are the most likely people to commit suicide. 
 So, what are the solutions?,We don't really have mental health insurance in this country,,and it's -- (Applause) -- it's really a crime.,Something like 98 percent of all people with depression,,and I mean really severe depression,-- I have a friend with stunningly severe depression,-- this is a curable disease, with present medicine and present technology.,But it is often a combination of talk therapy and pills.,Pills alone don't do it, especially in clinically depressed people.,You ought to be able to go to a psychiatrist or a psychologist,,and put down your 10-dollar copay, and get treated,,just like you do when you got a cut on your arm. It's ridiculous. 
 Secondly, drug companies are not going to develop really sophisticated,psychoactive drugs. We know that most mental illnesses have a biological,component that can be dealt with.,And we know just an amazing amount more about the brain now than we,did 10 years ago. We need a pump-push from the federal government,,through NIH and National Science -- NSF --,and places like that to start helping the drug companies,develop some advanced psychoactive drugs. 
 Moving on. Number nine -- don't laugh -- aliens invade Earth.,Ten years ago, you couldn't have found an astronomer --,well, very few astronomers -- in the world who would've told you that,there are any planets anywhere outside our solar system.,1995, we found three. The count now is up to 80 --,we're finding about two or three a month.,All of the ones we've found, by the way, are in this little, teeny, tiny corner where we live,,in the Milky Way. There must be millions of planets in the Milky Way,,and as Carl Sagan insisted for many years,,and was laughed at for it, there must be billions and billions in the universe.,In a few years, NASA is going to launch four or five telescopes out to Jupiter,,where there's less dust, and start looking for Earth-like planets,,which we cannot see with present technology, nor detect.,It's becoming obvious that the chance that life does not exist elsewhere in the universe,,and probably fairly close to us, is a fairly remote idea.,And the chance that some of it isn't more intelligent than ours is also a remote idea. 
 Remember, we've only been an advanced civilization --,an industrial civilization, if you would -- for 200 years.,Although every time I go to Pompeii, I'm amazed that they had,the equivalent of a McDonald's on every street corner, too.,So, I don't know how much civilization really has progressed since AD 79,,but there's a great likelihood. I really believe this,,and I don't believe in aliens, and I don't believe there are any aliens on the Earth,or anything like that. But there's a likelihood that we will confront a,civilization that is more intelligent than our own. 
 Now, what will happen? What if they come to, you know,,suck up our oceans for the hydrogen?,And swat us away like flies, the way we swat away flies when we go into,the rainforest and start logging it.,We can look at our own history. The late physicist Gerard O'Neill said,,"Advanced Western civilization has had a destructive effect,on all primitive civilizations it has come in contact with,,even in those cases where every attempt was made,to protect and guard the primitive civilization.",If the aliens come visiting, we're the primitive civilization. 
 So, what are the solutions to this? (Laughter),Thank God you can all read!,It may seem ridiculous, but we have a really lousy history of anticipating things like this,and actually being prepared for them.,How much energy and money does it take to actually have a plan,to negotiate with an advanced species? 
 Secondly -- and you're going to hear more from me about this --,we have to become an outward-looking, space-faring nation.,We have got to develop the,idea that the Earth doesn't last forever,,our sun doesn't last forever.,If we want humanity to last forever, we have to colonize the Milky Way.,And that is not something that is beyond comprehension at this point.,(Applause),It'll also help us a lot, if we meet an advanced civilization along the way,,if we're trying to be an advanced civilization. Number eight -- 
 (Voice: Steve, that's what I'm doing after TED.) (Laughter) (Applause) 
 SP: You've got it! You've got the job. 
 Number eight: the ecosystem collapses.,Last July, in Science, the journal Science,,19 oceanographers published a very, very unusual article.,It wasn't really a research report; it was a screed.,They said, we've been looking at the oceans for a long time now,,and we want to tell you they're not in trouble, they're near collapse.,Many other ecosystems on Earth are in real, real danger.,We're living in a time of mass extinctions that exceeds the fossil record,by a factor of 10,000.,We have lost 25 percent of the unique species in Hawaii in the last 20 years.,California is expected to lose 25 percent of its species in the next 40 years.,Somewhere in the Amazon forest is the marginal tree.,You cut down that tree, the rain forest collapses as an ecosystem.,There's really a tree like that out there. That's really what it comes to.,And when that ecosystem collapses, it could take a major ecosystem with it,,like our atmosphere. So, what do we do about this? What are the solutions? 
 There is some modeling of ecosystems going on now.,The problem with ecosystems is that we understand them so poorly,,that we don't know they're really in trouble until it's almost too late.,We need to know earlier that they're getting in trouble,,and we need to be able to pump possible solutions into models.,And with the kind of computing power we have now,,there is, as I say, some of this going on, but it needs money.,National Science Foundation needs to say -- you know,,almost all the money that's spent on science in this country,comes from the federal government, one way or another.,And they get to prioritize, you know?,There are people at the National Science Foundation,who get to say, this is the most important thing.,This is one of the things they ought to be thinking more about. 
 Secondly, we need to create huge biodiversity reserves on the planet,,and start moving them around.,There's been an experiment for the last four or five years on the Georges Bank,,or the Grand Banks off of Newfoundland. It's a no-take fishing zone.,They can't fish there for a radius of 200 miles.,And an amazing thing has happened: almost all the fish have come back,,and they're reproducing like crazy. We're going to have to start doing this,around the globe. We're going to have to have no-take zones.,We're going to have to say, no more logging in the Amazon for 20 years.,Let it recover, before we start logging again.,(Applause) 
 Number seven: particle accelerator mishap.,You all remember Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber?,One of the things he raved about was that a particle accelerator experiment,could go haywire and set off a chain reaction that would destroy the world.,A lot of very sober-minded physicists, believe it or not,,have had exactly the same thought.,This spring -- there's a collider at Brookhaven, on Long Island --,this spring, it's going to have an experiment in which it creates black holes.,They are expecting to create little, tiny black holes.,They expect them to evaporate. (Laughter),I hope they're right. (Laughter) 
 Other collider experiments -- there's one that's going to take place next summer,at CERN -- have the possibility of creating something called strangelets,,which are kind of like antimatter. Whenever they hit other matter, they destroy it,and obliterate it. Most physicists say that the accelerators we have now,are not really powerful enough to create black holes and strangelets,that we need to worry about, and they're probably right.,But, all around the world, in Japan, in Canada,,there's talk about this, of reviving this in the United States.,We shut one down that was going to be big.,But there's talk of building very big accelerators.,What can we do about this? What are the solutions? 
 We've got the fox watching the henhouse here.,We need to -- we need the advice of particle physicists to talk about particle physics,and what should be done in particle physics,,but we need some outside thinking and watchdogging,of what's going on with these experiments. 
 Secondly, we have a natural laboratory surrounding the Earth.,We have an electromagnetic field around the Earth,,and it's constantly bombarded by high-energy particles, like protons.,And in my opinion, we don't spend enough time,looking at that natural laboratory and figuring out first what's safe to do on Earth. 
 Number six: biotech disaster.,It's one of my favorite ones, because we've done several stories on Bt corn.,Bt corn is a corn that creates its own pesticide to kill a corn borer.,You may of heard of it -- heard it called StarLink,,especially when all those taco shells were taken out of the supermarkets,about a year and a half ago.,This stuff was supposed to only be feed for animals in the United States,,and it got into the human food supply, and somebody should've figured out,that it would get in the human food supply very easily.,But the thing that's alarming is a couple of months ago, in Mexico,,where Bt corn and all genetically altered corn is totally illegal,,they found Bt corn genes in wild corn plants.,Now, corn originated, we think, in Mexico.,This is the genetic biodiversity storehouse of corn.,This brings back a skepticism that has gone away recently,,that superweeds and superpests could spread around the world,,from biotechnology, that literally could destroy the world's food supply,in very short order. 
 So, what do we do about that?,We treat biotechnology with the same scrutiny we apply to nuclear power plants.,It's that simple. This is an amazingly unregulated field.,When the StarLink disaster happened, there was a battle between the,EPA and the FDA over who really had authority, and over what parts of this,,and they didn't get it straightened out for months. That's kind of crazy. 
 Number five, one of my favorites: reversal of the Earth's magnetic field.,Believe it or not, this happens every few hundred thousand years,,and has happened many times in our history.,North Pole goes to the South, South Pole goes to the North, and vice versa.,But what happens, as this occurs,,is that we lose our magnetic field around the Earth over the period of about 100 years,,and that means that all these cosmic rays and particles,that are to come streaming at us from the sun,,that this field protects us from, are -- well, basically, we're gonna fry. (Laughter) 
 (Voice: Steve, I have some additional hats downstairs.) 
 SP: So, what can we do about this? Oh, by the way, we're overdue.,It's been 780,000 years since this happened.,So, it should have happened about 480,000 years ago.,Oh, and here's one other thing.,Scientists think now our magnetic field may be diminished by about five percent.,So, maybe we're in the throes of it.,One of the problems of trying to figure out how healthy the Earth is,,is that we have -- you know, we don't have good weather data from 60 years ago,,much less data on things like the ozone layer. 
 So, there's a fairly simple solution to this.,There's going to be a lot of cheap rocketry that's going to come online,in about six or seven years,that gets us into the low atmosphere very cheaply.,You know, we can make ozone from car tailpipes.,It's not hard: it's just three oxygen atoms.,If you brought the entire ozone layer down to the surface of the Earth,,it would be the thickness of two pennies, at 14 pounds per square inch.,You don't need that much up there.,We need to learn how to repair and replenish the Earth's ozone layer.,(Applause) 
 Number four: giant solar flares.,Solar flares are enormous magnetic outbursts from the Sun,that bombard the Earth with high-speed subatomic particles.,So far, our atmosphere has done, and our magnetic field has done,pretty well protecting us from this.,Occasionally, we get a flare from the Sun that causes havoc,with communications and so forth, and electricity.,But the alarming thing is that astronomers recently have been studying,stars that are similar to our Sun,,and they've found that a number of them, when they're about the age of our Sun,,brighten by a factor of as much as 20. Doesn't last for very long.,And they think these are super-flares, millions of times more powerful,than any flares we've had from our Sun so far. 
 Obviously, we don't want one of those. (Laughter),There's a flip side to it. In studying stars,like our Sun, we've found that they go through periods of diminishment,,when their total amount of energy that's expelled from them,goes down by maybe one percent.,One percent doesn't sound like a lot, but it would cause one hell of an ice age here.,So, what can we do about this? 
 (Laughter) Start terraforming Mars. This is one of my favorite subjects.,I wrote a story about this in Life magazine in 1993.,This is rocket science, but it's not hard rocket science.,Everything that we need to make an atmosphere on Mars,,and to make a livable planet on Mars, is probably there.,And you just, literally, have to send little nuclear factories up there,that gobble up the iron oxide on the surface of Mars and spit out the oxygen.,The problem is it takes 300 years to terraform Mars, minimum.,Really more like 500 years to do it right.,There's no reason why we shouldn't start now. (Laughter) 
 Number three -- isn't this stuff cool? (Laughter),A new global epidemic. People have been at war with germs,ever since there have been people,,and from time to time, the germs sure get the upper hand.,In 1918, we had a flu epidemic in the United States that killed 20 million people.,That was back when the population was around 100 million people.,The bubonic plague in Europe, in the Middle Ages,,killed one out of four Europeans.,AIDS is coming back. Ebola seems to be rearing its head,with much too much frequency,,and old diseases like cholera are becoming resistant to antibiotics.,We've all learned what -- the kind of panic that can occur,when an old disease rears its head, like anthrax. 
 The worst possibility is that a very simple germ, like staph,,for which we have one antibiotic that still works, mutates.,And we know staph can do amazing things.,A staph cell can be next to a muscle cell in your body and borrow genes from it,when antibiotics come, and change and mutate.,The danger is that some germ like staph will be --,will mutate into something that's really virulent, very contagious,,and will sweep through populations before we can do anything about it.,That's happened before. About 12,000 years ago,,there was a massive wave of mammal extinctions in the Americas,,and that is thought to have been a virulent disease.,So, what can we do about it? 
 It is nuts. We give antibiotics -- (Applause) --,every cow, every lamb, every chicken, they get antibiotics every day, all.,You know, you go to a restaurant, you eat fish, I got news for you,,it's all farmed. You know, you gotta ask when you go to a restaurant if it's a wild fish,,cause they're not going to tell you. We're giving away the code.,This is like being at war and giving somebody your secret code.,We're telling the germs out there how to fight us.,We gotta fix that. We gotta outlaw that right away. 
 Secondly, our public health system, as we saw with anthrax, is a real disaster.,We have a real, major outbreak of disease in the United States,,we are not prepared to cope with it.,Now, there is money in the federal budget, next year,,to build up the public health service.,But I don't think to any extent that it really needs to be done. 
 Number two -- my favorite -- we meet a rogue black hole.,You know, 10 years ago, or 15 years ago, really,,you walk into an astronomy convention, and you say,,"You know, there's probably a black hole at the center of every galaxy,",and they're going to hoot you off the stage.,And now, if you went into one of those conventions and you said,,"Well, I don't think black holes are out there," they'd hoot you off the stage.,Our comprehension of the way the universe works is really --,has just gained unbelievably in recent years. 
 We think that there are about 10 million dead stars in the Milky Way alone, our galaxy.,And these stars have compressed down to maybe something like 12, 15 miles wide,,and they are black holes. And they are gobbling up everything around them,,including light, which is why we can't see them.,Most of them should be in orbit around something.,But galaxies are very violent places, and things can be spun out of orbit.,And also, space is incredibly vast.,So even if you flung a million of these things out of orbit,,the chances that one would actually hit us is fairly remote.,But it only has to get close, about a billion miles away, one of these things.,About a billion miles away, here's what happens to Earth's orbit:,it becomes elliptical instead of circular.,And for three months out of the year,,the surface temperatures go up to 150 to 180.,For three months out of the year, they go to 50 below zero.,That won't work too well. What can we do about this?,And this is my scariest. (Laughter),I don't have a good answer for this one.,Again, we gotta think about being a colonizing race. 
 And finally, number one: biggest danger to life as we know it, I think,,a really big asteroid heads for Earth.,The important thing to remember here -- this is not a question of if,,this is a question of when, and how big.,In 1908, just a 200-foot piece of a comet,exploded over Siberia and flattened forests for maybe 100 miles.,It had the effect of about 1,000 Hiroshima bombs.,Astronomers estimate that little asteroids like that come about every hundred years.,In 1989, a large asteroid passed 400,000 miles away from Earth. 
 Nothing to worry about, right?,It passed directly through Earth's orbit. We were in that that spot six hours earlier.,A small asteroid, say a half mile wide, would touch off firestorms,followed by severe global cooling from the debris kicked up --,Carl Sagan's nuclear winter thing.,An asteroid five miles wide causes major extinctions.,We think the one that got the dinosaurs was about five miles wide.,Where are they? There's something called the Kuiper belt,,which -- some people think Pluto's not a planet,,that's where Pluto is, it's in the Kuiper belt.,There's also something a little farther out, called the Oort cloud.,There are about 100,000 balls of ice and rock -- comets, really --,out there, that are 50 miles in diameter or more,,and they regularly take a little spin,,in towards the Sun and pass reasonably close to us.,Of more concern, I think, is the asteroids that exist between Mars and Jupiter.,The folks at the Sloan Digital Sky Survey told us last fall --,they're making the first map of the universe, three-dimensional map of the universe --,that there are probably 700,000 asteroids between Mars and Jupiter,that are a half a mile big or bigger.,So you say, yeah, well, what are really the chances of this happening?,Andrew, can you put that chart up? 
 This is a chart that Dr. Clark Chapman at the Southwest Research Institute,presented to Congress a few years ago.,You'll notice that the chance of an asteroid-slash-comet impact killing you,is about one in 20,000, according to the work they've done.,Now look at the one right below that.,Passenger aircraft crash, one in 20,000.,We spend an awful lot of money trying to be sure that we don't die in airplane accidents,,and we're not spending hardly anything on this. And yet, this is completely preventable.,We finally have, just in the last year, the technology to stop this cold.,Could we have the solutions? 
 NASA's spending three million dollars a year, three million bucks --,that is like pocket change -- to search for asteroids.,Because we can actually figure out every asteroid that's out there,,and if it might hit Earth, and when it might hit Earth.,And they're trying to do that.,But it's going to take them 10 years, at spending three million dollars a year,,and even then, they claim they'll only have about 80 percent of them catalogued.,Comets are a tougher act.,We don't really have the technology to predict comet trajectories,,or when one with our name on it might arrive.,But we would have lots of time, if we see it coming.,We really need a dedicated observatory.,You'll notice that a lot of comets are named after people you never heard of,,amateur astronomers? That's because nobody's looking for them, except amateurs.,We need a dedicated observatory that looks for comets. 
 Part two of the solutions: we need to figure out how to blow up an asteroid,,or alter its trajectory. Now, a year ago, we did an amazing thing.,We sent a probe out to this asteroid belt,,called NEAR, Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous.,And these guys orbited a 30 -- or no, about a 22-mile long asteroid called Eros.,And then, of course, you know, they pulled one of those sneaky NASA things,,where they had extra batteries and extra gas aboard and everything,,and then, at the last minute, they landed.,When the mission was over, they actually landed on the thing.,We have landed a rocket ship on an asteroid. It's not a big deal.,Now, the trouble with just sending a bomb out for this thing,is that you don't have anything to push against in space, because there's no air.,A nuclear explosion is just as hot,,but we don't really have anything big enough to melt a 22-mile long asteroid,,or vaporize it, would be more like it. 
 But we can learn to land on these asteroids that have our name on them,and put something like a small ion propulsion motor on it,,which would gently, slowly, after a period of time, push it into a different trajectory,,which, if we've done our math right, would keep it from hitting Earth.,This is just a matter of finding 'em, going there, and doing something about it.,I know your head is spinning from all this stuff.,Yikes! So many big threats! 
 The thing, I think, to remember, is September 11.,We don't want to get caught flat-footed again.,We know about this stuff.,Science has the power to predict the future in many cases now.,Knowledge is power.,The worst thing we can do is say, jeez, I got enough to worry about,without worrying about an asteroid. (Laughter),That's a mistake that could literally cost us our future.,Thank you.Dan Holzman: Please throw out the beanbag chairs. Here we go. 
 Barry Friedman: There are all kinds of high-tech chairs here today,,but this is really, I think, when it reached its peak,as far as ergonomics, comfort, design, flexibility ... 
 DH: Now obviously, this is not something we do on our regular show;,it's something we just kind of learned for this,,so we're going to try. But can we have some inspirational music for the beanbag chairs? 
 BF: Nice show, Daniel, nice show. You are the man!,Nice show. Man, that was good!,DH: Thank you.,BF: You know, sometimes when people do those, they go all the way down.,You actually just did that. (Laughter),That's the kind of extra effort that's gotten us where we are today ... 
 DH: All right, let's show them something special. 
 BF: ... without a MacArthur grant.,Yeah, look at this. You know, all kinds of different ...,TED is about invention, let's be honest. Right? DH: Yeah, it is. 
 BF: Last night, Michael Moschen showed some juggling props,he has invented and working on.,Right now, Dan's going to show something he actually invented. 
 DH: A type of juggling I actually invented,,right after I saw another juggler do it. 
 BF: Shut up. (Laughter) 
 DH: And this is a small excerpt from a longer piece. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Folks, this is shaker cup juggling. It's not a showstopper,but it certainly slows it down. 
 BF: Oh yeah, it does. (Drum roll),BF: Oh, Daniel. 
 (Applause) 
 DH: One more? (Drum roll),Perfect. (Drum roll),Perfect. (Drum roll),BF: OK. DH: Oh! All right. 
 (Applause) 
 I'm now pushing my luck: I'm skipping right to six cups.,In order to do six cups, I must have perfect control,over three with my right hand. (Drum roll) 
 BF: Also three with his left. 
 DH: Perfect. 
 (Laughter) 
 And now, all six cups. Should I do it on the first try,or should I miss once on purpose? (Laughter) 
 BF: First try? Once on purpose? 
 (Audience: Once on purpose!) 
 DH: How about if I try first and then decide? 
 BF: Good idea. (Laughter) Let's leave that. We'll leave that door open. 
 (Laughter) (Applause) 
 DH: He's looking at me. 
 BF: That's all right, he does that. All right. 
 DH: Oh! It's time for Richard's help. (Laughter),Oh, good. All right. 
 BF: You know, over the years, every year at the conference,,it's kind of become a tradition for us to do something dangerous,with Richard. And we've always done something with the bullwhips,in our act. It's funny, for years I did it with Daniel holding balloons.,And then we thought, "How stupid." 
 DH: Excuse me, could we work on the design of the microphone? 
 BF: I think that's the next session. 
 DH: Next session? 
 BF: Yeah. And so we've actually found a way to incorporate Richard in this.,He actually assumes more of the danger in this. 
 DH: Please stand up, Richard. (Whip cracks) 
 Oh, sorry. (Laughter) 
 DH: Now Richard, please ... (Whip cracks) 
 BF: OK, sorry. 
 DH: Jesus Christ. Richard, please stand in front of me. 
 Richard Wurman: Can I say something?,BF: Sure. 
 RW: In all past years I've rehearsed with them,,the things that have happened to me --,I have no idea what's going to happen and that's the truth. 
 DH: All right, please stand here in front ...,God, I hate that. Put your hands out like this, please. 
 (Laughter) 
 BF: No, come stay up with him.,Dan used to actually hold them but now he's got you for protection.,It's kind of neat. OK. 
 (Laughter) 
 DH: Wow, you've been working out. 
 BF: No, shut up! 
 (Laughter) 
 Having a little bit of Richard time. That's nice, that's good.,OK, here we go.,Have him hold your wrist so I can ... 
 DH: Please hold my wrist, will you. BF: Yeah, hold this a minute. 
 There you go. 
 (Laughter),OK. 
 OK, hold on. 
 RW: Hmmm. 
 (Laughter) 
 DH: First one. 
 BF: All those mid-year phone calls are coming back to me now, Richard. 
 (Laughter) 
 DH: So Richard, what were we on the list? Like 1,020? 
 (Laughter) 
 What happened there? 
 BF: I think we were just outside. 
 DH: I don't get it. (Applause) 
 (Laughter) 
 DH: Sorry. BF: Having some bad flashbacks. 
 RW: Do you want me to hold you or not? DH: Don't hold me that hard. 
 BF: Here we go, I'm taking it. (Balloon pops) (Applause) 
 DH: One more, one more. 
 BF: We've got one more we're going to do. 
 RW: Do I get to hold them? 
 BF: You don't want to hold these, trust me. 
 DH: Could you spread your legs a little bit? 
 (Laughter) 
 BF: Gloria, you want to do it? It's very cool. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 (Laughter) 
 One more try. Man, I don't want to get too close. 
 (Laughter) 
 Could you just push that? 
 (Applause) 
 DH: Wow! Boy! 
 BF: That's cool. I always wanted to try that. 
 (Laughter) 
 DH: Let's jump this way, though.,Now, we risked Richard's life, it's only fair we risk our own lives.,So to do that, I will juggle these three razor-sharp sickles.,And if that wasn't enough, and judging by your response, it's not ... 
 (Laughter) 
 DH: Wow! BF: Hoping for a little more build. 
 DH: True. Barry ... 
 BF: I'm going to run up behind him. 
 DH: Leap over my shoulder. 
 BF: Up and over his shoulders. 
 DH: Grab the blades in mid-air, land right there in a pool of blood ... 
 (Laughter) 
 Still juggling. (Laughter),Impossible, you say? 
 BF: Incredible, you say? 
 DH: Why bother, you say? 
 BF: Here we go. 
 DH: Just do it juggler boys, you say? 
 BF: This guy, this guy invented air.,DH: I think so, that's right.,Even the pencil. 
 BF: He invented the pencil. 
 DH: All right, we'll do this trick, but please remember,it took us over 10 years to perfect. 
 BF: Ten years to perfect, which you're about to see. 
 DH: It's not that difficult, we just don't like to practice that much. 
 BF: No, it's a hassle. Traveling too much.,Actually, we will take a second to prove --,this could be fake -- that the blades are indeed razor-sharp. 
 DH: Will someone please throw a small farm animal,up onto the stage? 
 (Laughter) 
 Or a virgin for a sacrifice? 
 BF: Anything? 
 DH: Where's Gloria? (Laughter) 
 BF: No, she's got ... farm animal. 
 DH: Do you have a small farm animal?,Just trying to play the odds. All right, here we go. 
 BF: Over the top, over the top. 
 DH: How you feeling, Barry? You feeling all right? 
 BF: Yeah, it's all right. 
 DH: Do you feel everything's OK? The atmosphere, the ... 
 BF: Yeah, a little sketchy. 
 DH: Everything up here's OK? 
 BF: Yeah. 
 DH: Then here we go. 
 BF: This one's a little ... Who's doing the lights? Could you,point that a little more directly,into my eyeballs? Is that possible? (Laughter) I can still see a little. 
 DH: And turn up the intensity; we're still pink in the middle.,We went too far. (Laughter) 
 BF: Yeah, it's too far. It's too much of a visual.,The design of the body is a whole different thing. 
 DH: Ready, Barry? BF: Over the top. 
 DH: May we have our jumping music please? (Silence),May we have it a bit louder? 
 (Laughter) 
 BF: They're a good crew! Whoa! 
 DH: Whoa, sorry. All right. 
 BF: We're going on. 
 DH: All right, we'll try again. 
 BF: All right? Oh my gosh. Oh. 
 DH: All right, here we go. Sorry about that. 
 BF: I thought I had the hard part. OK. 
 DH: Whenever you're ready. 
 BF: There we go! 
 (Applause) 
 All right, get up! Come on and dance! DH: Dance, come on. BF: Come on and dance!,Somebody dance! Come on! 
 (Applause) 
 Wow, wow, OK, stop.,Weird, no one dances. We're two guys doing this. (Laughter),I think that's uncomfortable for everyone. 
 DH: The French judge ... 
 BF: One more quick thing. 
 DH: The French judge gives it a 5.2. 
 (Laughter) 
 BF: Well, you know ... 
 DH: There you go ... BF: Oh, yeah. Another one coming in. 
 DH: Tell them about our bio and stuff. 
 BF: Yeah. In our bio, some of you may have read,that we've won two world juggling championships.,And believe it or not, you don't win juggling champions,for doing things with bullwhips or shaker cups.,We're going to show you right now,an excerpt from a routine that we used,to wipe out the other juggling team competition. 
 DH: That's right. 
 BF: Good. 
 DH: I know what you're thinking: other juggling teams must really suck. 
 (Laughter) 
 BF: Juggling's got a bad rap. 
 DH: But wait, Barry, there's still one more club lying there by my foot.,And look, it has a twin! 
 BF: Shut up. (Laughter) 
 DH: There's still one more by my foot.,What do you want me to do with it? 
 BF: Richard you tell him, it's your last year. (Laughter) 
 DH: That's a pretty good setup, Richard. 
 BF: Yeah, it's a good setup. That's a big setup. 
 DH: You can't get any better than that. All right. What I will do: I will use my panther-like reflexes. 
 BF: Nice. 
 DH: I got that --,to reach down and grab that club in my grip of steel. 
 BF: Nice. 
 DH: I touched it, Barry. That should be enough. 
 BF: It's progress, that's the thing. 
 (Laughter) 
 DH: How about that? I'll do it again.,Oh wait, it's on your side, Barry.,And it's awfully windy over there. 
 BF: It is, it's weird. You wouldn't think,it would affect half the stage, but it is. It's weird.,Watch this: what I'm going to do is slide the seventh one onto my foot. 
 DH: Wow! What a great trick, Barry!,Oh, look how it lies there.,Oh, Barry, is there nothing you can't do? 
 (Laughter) 
 You are my hero. You're my Jim Shea, Jr.,Too much Olympics. 
 BF: From my foot, I'll attempt to kick the seventh club. Here we go. 
 DH: Where, Barry? Where? Tell us, Barry.,[Unclear] eagerly awaits your next syllable. What will it be?,What gem of knowledge?,What pearl of wisdom?,Do you want to buy a vowel, Barry?,Is that your final answer? 
 BF: All right! You have to turn off the TV from time to time. 
 DH: I do, I do.,BF: From my foot, the kick up in the seven.,DH: We will juggle seven. 
 BF: From six to seven. DH: That's a world's record. BF: Really? DH: For us. 
 BF: Yes. 
 DH: Whenever you're ready there, big guy.,Put your tongue away, Barry. 
 BF: Oh, oh, whoa. 
 (Applause) 
 DH: Please, please stay seated. Stay seated. Thank you.,Because now, to make this twice as difficult,,we'll juggle the seven clubs back ... 
 BF: Seven-club juggling. 
 DH: ... to back. 
 BF: Thank you, that's it. 
 BF: Thank you guys! 
 DH: Thank you very much!I'm going to read a few strips.,These are, most of these are,from a monthly page I do,in and architecture and design magazine,called Metropolis. 
 And the first story is called,"The Faulty Switch." 
 Another beautifully designed new building,ruined by the sound of a common wall light switch.,It's fine during the day,when the main rooms are flooded with sunlight.,But at dusk,everything changes. 
 The architect spent hundreds of hours,designing the burnished brass switchplates,for his new office tower.,And then left it to a contractor,to install these 79-cent switches behind them. 
 We know instinctively where to reach,when we enter a dark room.,We automatically throw the little nub of plastic upward.,But the sound we are greeted with,,as the room is bathed in the simulated glow,of late-afternoon light,,recalls to mind,a dirty men's room,in the rear of a Greek coffee shop.,(Laughter) 
 This sound colors our first impression of any room;,it can't be helped.,But where does this sound,,commonly described as a click, come from?,Is it simply the byproduct of a,crude mechanical action?,Or is it an imitation,of one half the set of sounds we make,to express disappointment?,The often dental consonant,of no Indo-European language. 
 Or is it the amplified sound,of a synapse firing,in the brain of a cockroach?,In the 1950s they tried their best,to muffle this sound,with mercury switches,and silent knob controls. 
 But today these improvements,seem somehow inauthentic.,The click is the modern,triumphal clarion,proceeding us through life,,announcing our entry into every lightless room. 
 The sound made flicking a wall switch off,is of a completely different nature.,It has a deep melancholy ring.,Children don't like it.,It's why they leave lights on around the house. (Laughter),Adults find it comforting. 
 But wouldn't it be an easy matter,to wire a wall switch,so that it triggers the muted horn of a steam ship?,Or the recorded crowing of a rooster?,Or the distant peel of thunder? 
 Thomas Edison went through,thousands of unlikely substances,before he came upon the right one,for the filament of his electric light bulb.,Why have we settled so quickly,for the sound of its switch?,That's the end of that.,(Applause) 
 The next story is called,"In Praise of the Taxpayer." 
 That so many of the city's most venerable taxpayers,have survived yet another commercial building boom,,is cause for celebration. 
 These one or two story structures,,designed to yield only enough income,to cover the taxes on the land,on which they stand,,were not meant to be permanent buildings.,Yet for one reason or another,they have confounded the efforts of developers,to be combined into lots,suitable for high-rise construction. 
 Although they make no claim to architectural beauty,,they are, in their perfect temporariness,,a delightful alternative,to the large-scale structures,that might someday take their place.,The most perfect examples,occupy corner lots.,They offer a pleasant respite,from the high-density development around them.,A break of light and air,,an architectural biding of time. 
 So buried in signage,are these structures,,that it often takes a moment,to distinguish the modern,specially constructed taxpayer,from its neighbor:,the small commercial building,from an earlier century,,whose upper floors have been sealed,,and whose groundfloor space,now functions as a taxpayer.,The few surfaces not covered by signs,are often clad in a distinctive, dark,green-gray, striated aluminum siding.,Take-out sandwich shops,,film processing drop-offs,,peep-shows and necktie stores. 
 Now these provisional structures have,,in some cases,,remained standing,for the better part of a human lifetime.,The temporary building,is a triumph of modern industrial organization,,a healthy sublimation,of the urge to build,,and proof that not every,architectural idea,need be set in stone.,That's the end.,(Laughter) 
 And the next story is called, "On the Human Lap.",For the ancient Egyptians,the lap was a platform,upon which to place,the earthly possessions of the dead --,30 cubits from foot to knee. 
 It was not until the 14th century,that an Italian painter,recognized the lap,as a Grecian temple,,upholstered in flesh and cloth.,Over the next 200 years,we see the infant Christ,go from a sitting to a standing position,on the Virgin's lap,,and then back again.,Every child recapitulates this ascension,,straddling one or both legs,,sitting sideways,,or leaning against the body. 
 From there, to the modern ventriloquist's dummy,,is but a brief moment in history.,You were late for school again this morning.,The ventriloquist must first make us believe,that a small boy is sitting on his lap.,The illusion of speech follows incidentally.,What have you got to say for yourself, Jimmy? 
 As adults we admire the lap,from a nostalgic distance.,We have fading memories,of that provisional temple,,erected each time an adult sat down.,On a crowded bus there was always a lap to sit on.,It is children and teenage girls,who are most keenly aware,of its architectural beauty.,They understand the structural integrity,of a deep avuncular lap,,as compared to the shaky arrangement,of a neurotic niece in high heels. 
 The relationship between the lap and its owner,is direct and intimate.,I envision a 36-story,,450-unit residential high-rise --,a reason to consider the mental health,of any architect before granting,an important commission.,The bathrooms and kitchens will,,of course, have no windows.,The lap of luxury,is an architectural construct of childhood,,which we seek, in vain,,as adults, to employ.,That's the end.,(Laughter) 
 The next story is called "The Haverpiece Collection",A nondescript warehouse,,visible for a moment,from the northbound lanes of the Prykushko Expressway,,serves as the temporary resting place,for the Haverpiece collection,of European dried fruit. 
 The profound convolutions,on the surface of a dried cherry.,The foreboding sheen of an extra-large date. 
 Do you remember wandering as a child,through those dark wooden,storefront galleries?,Where everything was displayed,in poorly labeled roach-proof bins. 
 Pears dried in the form,of genital organs.,Apricot halves,like the ears of cherubim. 
 In 1962 the unsold stock,was purchased by Maurice Haverpiece,,a wealthy prune juice bottler,,and consolidated to form the core collection.,As an art form it lies somewhere between,still-life painting and plumbing. 
 Upon his death in 1967,,a quarter of the items were sold off for compote,to a high-class hotel restaurant.,(Laughter),Unsuspecting guests were served,stewed turn-of-the-century,Turkish figs for breakfast.,(Laughter) 
 The rest of the collection remains here,,stored in plain brown paper bags,until funds can be raised,to build a permanent museum,and study center. 
 A shoe made of apricot leather,for the daughter of a czar. 
 That's the end. Thank you.,(Applause)Frank Gehry: I listened to this scientist this morning.,Dr. Mullis was talking about his experiments,,and I realized that I almost became a scientist.,When I was 14 my parents bought me a chemistry set,and I decided to make water.,(Laughter),So, I made a hydrogen generator and I made an oxygen generator,,and I had the two pipes leading into a beaker,and I threw a match in.,(Laughter),And the glass -- luckily I turned around --,I had it all in my back,and I was about 15 feet away.,The wall was covered with ...,I had an explosion. 
 Richard Saul Wurman: Really? 
 FG: People on the street came and knocked on the door,to see if I was okay.,RSW: ... huh. (Laughter) 
 I'd like to start,this session again.,The gentleman to my left is the very famous, perhaps overly famous,,Frank Gehry.,(Laughter),(Applause),And Frank, you've come to a place in your life, which is astonishing.,I mean it is astonishing for an artist, for an architect,,to become actually an icon and a legend in their own time.,I mean you have become, whether you can giggle at it,because it's a funny ... you know, it's a strange thought,,but your building is an icon --,you can draw a little picture of that building, it can be used in ads --,and you've had not rock star status, but celebrity status,in doing what you wanted to do for most of your life.,And I know the road was extremely difficult.,And it didn't seem, at least, that your sell outs,,whatever they were, were very big.,You kept moving ahead in a life where you're dependent,on working for somebody.,But that's an interesting thing for a creative person.,A lot of us work for people;,we're in the hands of other people.,And that's one of the great dilemmas -- we're in a creativity session --,it's one of the great dilemmas in creativity:,how to do work that's big enough and not sell out.,And you've achieved that,and that makes your win doubly big, triply big.,It's not quite a question but you can comment on it.,It's a big issue. 
 FG: Well, I've always just ...,I've never really gone out looking for work.,I always waited for it to sort of hit me on the head.,And when I started out,,I thought that architecture was a service business,and that you had to please the clients and stuff.,And I realized when I'd come into the meetings,with these corrugated metal and chain link stuff,,and people would just look at me,like I'd just landed from Mars.,But I couldn't do anything else.,That was my response to the people in the time.,And actually, it was responding to clients that I had,who didn't have very much money, so they couldn't afford very much.,I think it was circumstantial. 
 Until I got to my house, where the client was my wife.,We bought this tiny little bungalow in Santa Monica,and for like 50 grand I built a house around it.,And a few people got excited about it.,I was visiting with an artist, Michael Heizer,,out in the desert near Las Vegas somewhere.,He's building this huge concrete place.,And it was late in the evening. We'd had a lot to drink.,We were standing out in the desert all alone and,,thinking about my house, he said,,"Did it ever occur to you if you built stuff more permanent,,somewhere in 2000 years somebody's going to like it?",(Laughter),So, I thought, "Yeah, that's probably a good idea.",Luckily I started to get some clients that had a little more money,,so the stuff was a little more permanent.,But I just found out the world ain't going to last that long,,this guy was telling us the other day.,So where do we go now?,Back to -- everything's so temporary. 
 I don't see it the way you characterized it.,For me, every day is a new thing.,I approach each project with a new insecurity,,almost like the first project I ever did,,and I get the sweats,,I go in and start working, I'm not sure where I'm going --,if I knew where I was going, I wouldn't do it.,When I can predict or plan it, I don't do it.,I discard it.,So I approach it with the same trepidation.,Obviously, over time I have a lot more confidence,that it's going to be OK.,I do run a kind of a business --,I've got 120 people,and you've got to pay them,,so there's a lot of responsibility involved --,but the actual work on the project is with,,I think, a healthy insecurity. 
 And like the playwright said the other day -- I could relate to him:,you're not sure.,When Bilbao was finished and I looked at it,,I saw all the mistakes, I saw ...,They weren't mistakes;,I saw everything that I would have changed,and I was embarrassed by it.,I felt an embarrassment -- "How could I have done that?,How could I have made shapes like that or done stuff like that?",It's taken several years to now look at it detached and say --,as you walk around the corner and a piece of it works with the road,and the street, and it appears to have a relationship --,that I started to like it. 
 RSW: What's the status of the New York project? 
 FG: I don't really know.,Tom Krens came to me with Bilbao and explained it all to me,,and I thought he was nuts.,I didn't think he knew what he was doing,,and he pulled it off.,So, I think he's Icarus and Phoenix all in one guy.,(Laughter),He gets up there and then he ... comes back up.,They're still talking about it.,September 11 generated some interest,in moving it over to Ground Zero,,and I'm totally against that.,I just feel uncomfortable talking about or building anything on Ground Zero,I think for a long time. 
 RSW: The picture on the screen,,is that Disney? 
 FG: Yeah. 
 RSW: How much further along is it than that,,and when will that be finished? 
 FG: That will be finished in 2003 -- September, October --,and I'm hoping Kyu, and Herbie, and Yo-Yo and all those guys,come play with us at that place.,Luckily, today most of the people I'm working with are people I really like.,Richard Koshalek is probably one of the main reasons,that Disney Hall came to me.,He's been a cheerleader for quite a long time.,There aren't many people around that are really involved,with architecture as clients.,If you think about the world,,and even just in this audience,,most of us are involved with buildings.,Nothing that you would call architecture, right?,And so to find one, a guy like that,,you hang on to him.,He's become the head of Art Center,,and there's a building by Craig Ellwood there.,I knew Craig and respected him.,They want to add to it,and it's hard to add to a building like that --,it's a beautiful, minimalist, black steel building --,and Richard wants to add a library and more student stuff,and it's a lot of acreage.,I convinced him to let me bring in another architect,from Portugal: Alvaro Siza. 
 RSW: Why did you want that? 
 FG: I knew you'd ask that question. 
 It was intuitive.,(Laughter) 
 Alvaro Siza grew up and lived in Portugal,and is probably considered the Portuguese main guy in architecture.,I visited with him a few years ago,and he showed me his early work,,and his early work had a resemblance to my early work.,When I came out of college,,I started to try to do things contextually in Southern California,,and you got into the logic of Spanish colonial tile roofs,and things like that.,I tried to understand that language as a beginning,,as a place to jump off,,and there was so much of it being done by spec builders,and it was trivialized so much that it wasn't ...,I just stopped.,I mean, Charlie Moore did a bunch of it,,but it didn't feel good to me.,Siza, on the other hand, continued in Portugal,where the real stuff was,and evolved a modern language that relates to that historic language.,And I always felt that he should come to Southern California,and do a building.,I tried to get him a couple of jobs and they didn't pan out.,I like the idea of collaboration with people like that,because it pushes you.,I've done it with Claes Oldenburg and with Richard Serra,,who doesn't think architecture is art.,Did you see that thing?,RSW: No. What did he say? 
 FG: He calls architecture "plumbing.",(Laughter) 
 FG: Anyway, the Siza thing.,It's a richer experience.,It must be like that for Kyu doing things with musicians --,it's similar to that I would imagine --,where you ... huh? 
 Audience: Liquid architecture. 
 FG: Liquid architecture.,(Laughter),Where you ... It's like jazz: you improvise, you work together,,you play off each other, you make something,,they make something.,And I think,for me, it's a way of trying to understand the city,and what might happen in the city. 
 RSW: Is it going to be near the current campus?,Or is it going to be down near ... 
 FG: No, it's near the current campus.,Anyway, he's that kind of patron.,It's not his money, of course.,(Laughter) 
 RSW: What's his schedule on that? 
 FG: I don't know.,What's the schedule, Richard?,Richard Koshalek: [Unclear] starts from 2004. 
 FG: 2004.,You can come to the opening. I'll invite you.,No, but the issue of city building in democracy is interesting,because it creates chaos, right?,Everybody doing their thing makes a very chaotic environment,,and if you can figure out how to work off each other --,if you can get a bunch of people,who respect each other's work and play off each other,,you might be able to create models for,how to build sections of the city without resorting to the one architect.,Like the Rockefeller Center model,,which is kind of from another era. 
 RSW: I found the most remarkable thing.,My preconception of Bilbao was this wonderful building,,you go inside and there'd be extraordinary spaces.,I'd seen drawings you had presented here at TED.,The surprise of Bilbao was in its context to the city.,That was the surprise of going across the river,,of going on the highway around it,,of walking down the street and finding it.,That was the real surprise of Bilbao. 
 FG: But you know, Richard,,most architects when they present their work --,most of the people we know,,you get up and you talk about your work,,and it's almost like you tell everybody you're a good guy,by saying, "Look, I'm worried about the context,,I'm worried about the city,,I'm worried about my client,,I worry about budget, that I'm on time.",Blah, blah, blah and all that stuff.,And it's like cleansing yourself so that you can ...,by saying all that, it means your work is good somehow.,And I think everybody --,I mean that should be a matter of fact, like gravity.,You're not going to defy gravity.,You've got to work with the building department.,If you don't meet the budgets, you're not going to get much work.,If it leaks --,Bilbao did not leak.,I was so proud.,(Laughter),The MIT project -- they were interviewing me for MIT,and they sent their facilities people to Bilbao.,I met them in Bilbao.,They came for three days. 
 RSW: This is the computer building? 
 FG: Yeah, the computer building.,They were there three days and it rained every day,and they kept walking around --,I noticed they were looking under things,and looking for things,,and they wanted to know where the buckets were hidden, you know?,People put buckets out ...,I was clean. There wasn't a bloody leak in the place,,it was just fantastic.,But you've got to --,yeah, well up until then every building leaked, so this ...,(Laughter) 
 RSW: Frank had a sort of ... 
 FG: Ask Miriam! 
 RW: ... sort of had a fame. His fame was built on that in L.A. for a while.,(Laughter) 
 FG: You've all heard the Frank Lloyd Wright story,,when the woman called and said,,"Mr. Wright, I'm sitting on the couch,and the water's pouring in on my head.",And he said, "Madam, move your chair.",(Laughter),So, some years later I was doing a building,,a little house on the beach for Norton Simon,,and his secretary, who was kind of a hell on wheels type lady,,called me and said,,"Mr. Simon's sitting at his desk,and the water's coming in on his head.",And I told her the Frank Lloyd Wright story. 
 RSW: Didn't get a laugh. 
 FG: No. Not now either.,(Laughter) 
 But my point is that ... and I call it the "then what?",OK, you solved all the problems,,you did all the stuff, you made nice,,you loved your clients,,you loved the city,,you're a good guy, you're a good person ...,and then what?,What do you bring to it?,And I think that's what I've always been interested in,,is that -- which is a personal kind of expression.,Bilbao, I think, shows that you can have,that kind of personal expression,and still touch all the bases that are necessary,of fitting into the city.,That's what reminded me of it.,And I think that's the issue, you know;,it's the "then what" that most clients who hire architects --,most clients aren't hiring architects for that.,They're hiring them to get it done, get it on budget,,be polite,,and they're missing out on the real value of an architect. 
 RSW: At a certain point a number of years ago, people --,when Michael Graves was a fashion, before teapots ... 
 FG: I did a teapot and nobody bought it.,(Laughter) 
 RSW: Did it leak? 
 FG: No.,(Laughter) 
 RSW: ... people wanted a Michael Graves building.,Is that a curse, that people want a Bilbao building? 
 FG: Yeah.,Since Bilbao opened, which is now four, five years,,both Krens and I have been called,with at least 100 opportunities --,China, Brazil, other parts of Spain --,to come in and do the Bilbao effect.,And I've met with some of these people.,Usually I say no right away,,but some of them come with pedigree,and they sound well-intentioned,and they get you for at least one or two meetings.,In one case, I flew all the way to Malaga with a team,because the thing was signed with seals and various,very official seals from the city,,and that they wanted me to come and do a building in their port.,I asked them what kind of building it was.,"When you get here we'll explain it." Blah, blah, blah.,So four of us went.,And they took us -- they put us up in a great hotel,and we were looking over the bay,,and then they took us in a boat out in the water,and showed us all these sights in the harbor.,Each one was more beautiful than the other.,And then we were going to have lunch with the mayor,and we were going to have dinner with,the most important people in Malaga.,Just before going to lunch with the mayor,,we went to the harbor commissioner.,It was a table as long as this carpet,and the harbor commissioner was here,,and I was here, and my guys.,We sat down, and we had a drink of water,and everybody was quiet.,And the guy looked at me and said,,"Now what can I do for you, Mr. Gehry?",(Laughter) 
 RSW: Oh, my God.,FG: So, I got up.,I said to my team,,"Let's get out of here.",We stood up, we walked out.,They followed -- the guy that dragged us there followed us and he said,,"You mean you're not going to have lunch with the mayor?",I said, "Nope.","You're not going to have dinner at all?",They just brought us there to hustle this group,,you know, to create a project.,And we get a lot of that.,Luckily, I'm old enough that,I can complain I can't travel.,(Laughter),I don't have my own plane yet. 
 RSW: Well, I'm going to wind this up and wind up the meeting,because it's been very long.,But let me just say a couple words. 
 FG: Can I say something?,Are you going to talk about me or you?,(Laughter),(Applause) 
 RSW: Once a shit, always a shit! 
 FG: Because I want to get a standing ovation like everybody, so ... 
 RSW: You're going to get one! You're going to get one!,(Laughter) 
 I'm going to make it for you! 
 FG: No, no. Wait a minute!,(Applause)Good morning everyone. First of all, it's been fantastic,being here over these past few days.,And secondly, I feel it's a great honor to kind of wind up,this extraordinary gathering of people,,these amazing talks that we've had.,I feel that I've fitted in, in many ways,,to some of the things that I've heard.,I came directly here,from the deep, deep tropical rainforest in Ecuador,,where I was out -- you could only get there by a plane --,with indigenous people with paint on their faces,and parrot feathers on their headdresses,,where these people are fighting to try and keep the oil companies,,and keep the roads, out of their forests.,They're fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest,in a world that's clean, a world that isn't contaminated,,a world that isn't polluted.,And what was so amazing to me, and what fits right in,with what we're all talking about here at TED,,is that there, right in the middle of this rainforest,,was some solar panels -- the first in that part of Ecuador --,and that was mainly to bring water up by pump,so that the women wouldn't have to go down.,The water was cleaned, but because they got a lot of batteries,,they were able to store a lot of electricity.,So every house -- and there were, I think, eight houses,in this little community -- could have light,for, I think it was about half an hour each evening.,And there is the Chief, in all his regal finery, with a laptop computer.,(Laughter),And this man, he has been outside, but he's gone back,,and he was saying, "You know, we have suddenly jumped into,a whole new era, and we didn't even know about the white man,50 years ago, and now here we are with laptop computers,,and there are some things we want to learn from the modern world.,We want to know about health care.,We want to know about what other people do -- we're interested in it.,And we want to learn other languages.,We want to know English and French and perhaps Chinese,,and we're good at languages.",So there he is with his little laptop computer,,but fighting against the might of the pressures --,because of the debt, the foreign debt of Ecuador --,fighting the pressure of World Bank, IMF, and of course,the people who want to exploit the forests and take out the oil.,And so, coming directly from there to here.,But, of course, my real field of expertise,lies in an even different kind of civilization --,I can't really call it a civilization.,A different way of life, a different being.,We've talked earlier -- this wonderful talk by Wade Davis,about the different cultures of the humans around the world --,but the world is not composed only of human beings;,there are also other animal beings.,And I propose to bring into this TED conference,,as I always do around the world, the voice of the animal kingdom.,Too often we just see a few slides, or a bit of film,,but these beings have voices that mean something.,And so, I want to give you a greeting,,as from a chimpanzee in the forests of Tanzania --,Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!,(Applause),I've been studying chimpanzees in Tanzania since 1960.,During that time, there have been modern technologies,that have really transformed the way,that field biologists do their work.,For example, for the first time, a few years ago,,by simply collecting little fecal samples,we were able to have them analyzed -- to have DNA profiling done --,so for the first time, we actually know which male chimps,are the fathers of each individual infant.,Because the chimps have a very promiscuous mating society.,So this opens up a whole new avenue of research.,And we use GSI -- geographic whatever it is, GSI --,to determine the range of the chimps.,And we're using -- you can see that I'm not really into this kind of stuff --,but we're using satellite imagery,to look at the deforestation in the area.,And of course, there's developments in infrared,,so you can watch animals at night,,and equipment for recording by video,,and tape recording is getting lighter and better.,So in many, many ways, we can do things today,that we couldn't do when I began in 1960.,Especially when chimpanzees, and other animals,with large brains, are studied in captivity,,modern technology is helping us to search,for the upper levels of cognition in some of these non-human animals.,So that we know today, they're capable of performances,that would have been thought absolutely impossible,by science when I began.,I think the chimpanzee in captivity who is the most skilled,in intellectual performance is one called Ai in Japan --,her name means love --,and she has a wonderfully sensitive partner working with her.,She loves her computer --,she'll leave her big group, and her running water,,and her trees and everything.,And she'll come in to sit at this computer --,it's like a video game for a kid; she's hooked.,She's 28, by the way, and she does things with her computer screen,and a touch pad that she can do faster than most humans.,She does very complex tasks, and I haven't got time to go into them,,but the amazing thing about this female is,she doesn't like making mistakes.,If she has a bad run, and her score isn't good,,she'll come and reach up and tap on the glass --,because she can't see the experimenter --,which is asking to have another go.,And her concentration -- she's already concentrated hard,for 20 minutes or so, and now she wants to do it all over again,,just for the satisfaction of having done it better.,And the food is not important -- she does get a tiny reward,,like one raisin for a correct response --,but she will do it for nothing, if you tell her beforehand.,So here we are, a chimpanzee using a computer.,Chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans also learn human sign language.,But the point is that when I was first in Gombe in 1960 --,I remember so well, so vividly, as though it was yesterday --,the first time, when I was going through the vegetation,,the chimpanzees were still running away from me, for the most part,,although some were a little bit acclimatized --,and I saw this dark shape, hunched over a termite mound,,and I peered with my binoculars.,It was, fortunately, one adult male whom I'd named David Greybeard --,and by the way, science at that time was telling me that I shouldn't name the chimps;,they should all have numbers; that was more scientific.,Anyway, David Greybeard -- and I saw that,he was picking little pieces of grass and using them,to fish termites from their underground nest.,And not only that -- he would sometimes pick a leafy twig,and strip the leaves --,modifying an object to make it suitable for a specific purpose --,the beginning of tool-making.,The reason this was so exciting and such a breakthrough,is at that time, it was thought that humans,,and only humans, used and made tools.,When I was at school, we were defined as man, the toolmaker.,So that when Louis Leakey, my mentor, heard this news,,he said, "Ah, we must now redefine 'man,' redefine 'tool,',or accept chimpanzees as humans.",(Laughter),We now know that at Gombe alone, there are nine different ways,in which chimpanzees use different objects for different purposes.,Moreover, we know that in different parts of Africa,,wherever chimps have been studied,,there are completely different tool-using behaviors.,And because it seems that these patterns are passed,from one generation to the next, through observation,,imitation and practice -- that is a definition of human culture.,What we find is that over these 40-odd years,that I and others have been studying chimpanzees,and the other great apes, and, as I say, other mammals,with complex brains and social systems,,we have found that after all, there isn't a sharp line,dividing humans from the rest of the animal kingdom.,It's a very wuzzy line.,It's getting wuzzier all the time as we find animals doing things,that we, in our arrogance, used to think was just human.,The chimps -- there's no time to discuss their fascinating lives --,but they have this long childhood, five years,of suckling and sleeping with the mother,,and then another three, four or five years,of emotional dependence on her, even when the next child is born.,The importance of learning in that time, when behavior is flexible --,and there's an awful lot to learn in chimpanzee society.,The long-term affectionate supportive bonds,that develop throughout this long childhood with the mother,,with the brothers and sisters,,and which can last through a lifetime,,which may be up to 60 years.,They can actually live longer than 60 in captivity,,so we've only done 40 years in the wild so far.,And we find chimps are capable of true compassion and altruism.,We find in their non-verbal communication -- this is very rich --,they have a lot of sounds, which they use in different circumstances,,but they also use touch, posture, gesture,,and what do they do?,They kiss; they embrace; they hold hands.,They pat one another on the back; they swagger; they shake their fist --,the kind of things that we do,,and they do them in the same kind of context.,They have very sophisticated cooperation.,Sometimes they hunt -- not that often,,but when they hunt, they show sophisticated cooperation,,and they share the prey.,We find that they show emotions, similar to -- maybe sometimes the same --,as those that we describe in ourselves as happiness, sadness, fear, despair.,They know mental as well as physical suffering.,And I don't have time to go into the information,that will prove some of these things to you,,save to say that there are very bright students, in the best universities,,studying emotions in animals, studying personalities in animals.,We know that chimpanzees and some other creatures,can recognize themselves in mirrors -- "self" as opposed to "other.",They have a sense of humor, and these are the kind of things,which traditionally have been thought of as human prerogatives.,But this teaches us a new respect -- and it's a new respect,not only for the chimpanzees, I suggest,,but some of the other amazing animals with whom we share this planet.,Once we're prepared to admit that after all,,we're not the only beings with personalities, minds,and above all feelings, and then we start to think,about ways we use and abuse,so many other sentient, sapient creatures on this planet,,it really gives cause for deep shame, at least for me.,So, the sad thing is that these chimpanzees --,who've perhaps taught us, more than any other creature, a little humility --,are in the wild, disappearing very fast.,They're disappearing for the reasons,that all of you in this room know only too well.,The deforestation, the growth of human populations, needing more land.,They're disappearing because some timber companies,go in with clear-cutting.,They're disappearing in the heart of their range in Africa,because the big multinational logging companies have come in and made roads --,as they want to do in Ecuador,and other parts where the forests remain untouched --,to take out oil or timber.,And this has led in Congo basin, and other parts of the world,,to what is known as the bush-meat trade.,This means that although for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years,,people have lived in those forests, or whatever habitat it is,,in harmony with their world, just killing the animals they need,for themselves and their families --,now, suddenly, because of the roads,,the hunters can go in from the towns.,They shoot everything, every single thing that moves,that's bigger than a small rat; they sun-dry it or smoke it.,And now they've got transport; they take it on the logging trucks,or the mining trucks into the towns where they sell it.,And people will pay more for bush-meat, as it's called,,than for domestic meat -- it's culturally preferred.,And it's not sustainable, and the huge logging camps in the forest,are now demanding meat, so the Pygmy hunters in the Congo basin,who've lived there with their wonderful way of living,for so many hundreds of years are now corrupted.,They're given weapons; they shoot for the logging camps; they get money.,Their culture is being destroyed,,along with the animals upon whom they depend.,So, when the logging camp moves, there's nothing left.,We talked already about the loss of human cultural diversity,,and I've seen it happening with my own eyes.,And the grim picture in Africa -- I love Africa,,and what do we see in Africa?,We see deforestation;,we see the desert spreading; we see massive hunger;,we see disease and we see population growth in areas,where there are more people living on a certain piece of land,than the land can possibly support,,and they're too poor to buy food from elsewhere.,Were the people that we heard about yesterday,,on the Easter Island, who cut down their last tree -- were they stupid?,Didn't they know what was happening?,Of course, but if you've seen the crippling poverty,in some of these parts of the world,it isn't a question of "Let's leave the tree for tomorrow.","How am I going to feed my family today?,Maybe I can get just a few dollars from this last tree,which will keep us going a little bit longer,,and then we'll pray that something will happen,to save us from the inevitable end.",So, this is a pretty grim picture.,The one thing we have, which makes us so different,from chimpanzees or other living creatures,,is this sophisticated spoken language --,a language with which we can tell children,about things that aren't here.,We can talk about the distant past, plan for the distant future,,discuss ideas with each other,,so that the ideas can grow from the accumulated wisdom of a group.,We can do it by talking to each other;,we can do it through video; we can do it through the written word.,And we are abusing this great power we have to be wise stewards,,and we're destroying the world.,In the developed world, in a way, it's worse,,because we have so much access to knowledge,of the stupidity of what we're doing.,Do you know, we're bringing little babies,into a world where, in many places, the water is poisoning them?,And the air is harming them, and the food that's grown,from the contaminated land is poisoning them.,And that's not just in the far-away developing world; that's everywhere.,Do you know we all have about 50 chemicals,in our bodies we didn't have about 50 years ago?,And so many of these diseases, like asthma,and certain kinds of cancers, are on the increase,around places where our filthy toxic waste is dumped.,We're harming ourselves around the world,,as well as harming the animals, as well as harming nature herself --,Mother Nature, that brought us into being;,Mother Nature, where I believe we need to spend time,,where there's trees and flowers and birds,for our good psychological development.,And yet, there are hundreds and hundreds of children,in the developed world who never see nature,,because they're growing up in concrete,and all they know is virtual reality,,with no opportunity to go and lie in the sun,,or in the forest, with the dappled sun-specks,coming down from the canopy above.,As I was traveling around the world, you know,,I had to leave the forest -- that's where I love to be.,I had to leave these fascinating chimpanzees,for my students and field staff to continue studying,because, finding they dwindled from about two million,100 years ago to about 150,000 now,,I knew I had to leave the forest to do what I could,to raise awareness around the world.,And the more I talked about the chimpanzees' plight,,the more I realized the fact that everything's interconnected,,and the problems of the developing world,so often stem from the greed of the developed world,,and everything was joining together, and making -- not sense,,hope lies in sense, you said -- it's making a nonsense.,How can we do it?,Somebody said that yesterday.,And as I was traveling around, I kept meeting young people who'd lost hope.,They were feeling despair,,they were feeling, "Well, it doesn't matter what we do;,eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die.,Everything is hopeless -- we're always being told so by the media.",And then I met some who were angry,,and anger that can turn to violence,,and we're all familiar with that.,And I have three little grandchildren,,and when some of these students would say to me,at high school or university, they'd say, "We're angry,",or "We're filled with despair, because we feel,you've compromised our future, and there's nothing we can do about it.",And I looked in the eyes of my little grandchildren,,and think how much we've harmed this planet since I was their age.,I feel this deep shame, and that's why in 1991 in Tanzania,,I started a program that's called Roots and Shoots.,There's little brochures all around outside,,and if any of you have anything to do with children and care about their future,,I beg that you pick up that brochure.,And Roots and Shoots is a program for hope.,Roots make a firm foundation.,Shoots seem tiny,,but to reach the sun they can break through brick walls.,See the brick walls as all the problems,that we've inflicted on this planet.,Then, you see, it is a message of hope.,Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world,can break through, and can make this a better world.,And the most important message of Roots and Shoots,is that every single individual makes a difference.,Every individual has a role to play.,Every one of us impacts the world around us everyday,,and you scientists know that you can't actually --,even if you stay in bed all day, you're breathing oxygen,and giving out CO2, and probably going to the loo,,and things like that --,you're making a difference in the world.,So, the Roots and Shoots program,involves youth in three kinds of projects.,And these are projects to make the world around them a better place.,One project to show care and concern for your own human community.,One for animals, including domestic animals -- and I have to say,,I learned everything I know about animal behavior,even before I got to Gombe and the chimps from my dog, Rusty,,who was my childhood companion.,And the third kind of project: something for the local environment.,So what the kids do depends first of all, how old are they --,and we go now from pre-school right through university.,It's going to depend whether they're inner-city or rural.,It's going to depend if they're wealthy or impoverished.,It's going to depend which part, say, of America they're in.,We're in every state now, and the problems in Florida,are different from the problems in New York.,It's going to depend on which country they're in --,and we're already in 60-plus countries, with about 5,000 active groups --,and there are groups all over the place that I keep hearing about,that I've never even heard of, because the kids are taking the program,and spreading it themselves.,Why?,Because they're buying into it,,and they're the ones who get to decide what they're going to do.,It isn't something that their parents tell them,,or their teachers tell them.,That's effective, but if they decide themselves,,"We want to clean this river,and put the fish back that used to be there.,We want to clear away the toxic soil,from this area and have an organic garden.,We want to go and spend time with the old people,and hear their stories and record their oral histories.,We want to go and work in a dog shelter.,We want to learn about animals. We want ... ",You know, it goes on and on, and this is very hopeful for me.,As I travel around the world 300 days a year,,everywhere there's a group of Roots and Shoots of different ages.,Everywhere there are children with shining eyes saying,,"Look at the difference we've made.",And now comes the technology into it,,because with this new way of communicating electronically,these kids can communicate with each other around the world.,And if anyone is interested to help us, we've got so many ideas,but we need help -- we need help to create the right kind of system,that will help these young people to communicate their excitement.,But also -- and this is so important -- to communicate their despair,,to say, "We've tried this and it doesn't work, and what shall we do?",And then, lo and behold, there's another group answering these kids,who may be in America, or maybe this is a group in Israel,,saying, "Yeah, you did it a little bit wrong. This is how you should do it.",The philosophy is very simple.,We do not believe in violence.,No violence, no bombs, no guns.,That's not the way to solve problems.,Violence leads to violence, at least in my view.,So how do we solve?,The tools for solving the problems are knowledge and understanding.,Know the facts, but see how they fit in the big picture.,Hard work and persistence --don't give up --,and love and compassion leading to respect for all life.,How many more minutes? Two, one?,Chris Anderson: One -- one to two.,Jane Goodall: Two, two, I'm going to take two.,(Laughter),Are you going to come and drag me off?,(Laughter),Anyway -- so basically, Roots and Shoots,is beginning to change young people's lives.,It's what I'm devoting most of my energy to.,And I believe that a group like this can have a very major impact,,not just because you can share technology with us,,but because so many of you have children.,And if you take this program out, and give it to your children,,they have such a good opportunity to go out and do good,,because they've got parents like you.,And it's been so clear how much you all care,about trying to make this world a better place.,It's very encouraging.,But the kids do ask me --,and this won't take more than two minutes, I promise --,the kids say, "Dr. Jane, do you really have hope for the future?,You travel, you see all these horrible things happening.",Firstly, the human brain -- I don't need to say anything about that.,Now that we know what the problems are around the world,,human brains like yours are rising to solve those problems.,And we've talked a lot about that.,Secondly, the resilience of nature.,We can destroy a river,,and we can bring it back to life.,We can see a whole area desolated,,and it can be brought back to bloom again, with time or a little help.,And thirdly, the last speaker talked about -- or the speaker before last,,talked about the indomitable human spirit.,We are surrounded by the most amazing people,who do things that seem to be absolutely impossible.,Nelson Mandela -- I take a little piece of limestone,from Robben Island Prison, where he labored for 27 years,,and came out with so little bitterness, he could lead his people,from the horror of apartheid without a bloodbath.,Even after the 11th of September -- and I was in New York,and I felt the fear -- nevertheless, there was so much human courage,,so much love and so much compassion.,And then as I went around the country after that and felt the fear --,the fear that was leading to people feeling,they couldn't worry about the environment any more,,in case they seemed not to be patriotic --,and I was trying to encourage them,,somebody came up with a little quotation from Mahatma Gandhi,,"If you look back through human history,,you see that every evil regime has been overcome by good.",And just after that a woman brought me this little bell,,and I want to end on this note.,She said, "If you're talking about hope and peace, ring this.,This bell is made from metal from a defused landmine,,from the killing fields of Pol Pot --,one of the most evil regimes in human history --,where people are now beginning to put their lives back together,after the regime has crumbled.,So, yes, there is hope, and where is the hope?,Is it out there with the politicians?,It's in our hands.,It's in your hands and my hands,and those of our children.,It's really up to us.,We're the ones who can make a difference.,If we lead lives where we consciously leave,the lightest possible ecological footprints,,if we buy the things that are ethical for us to buy,and don't buy the things that are not,,we can change the world overnight.,Thank you.I started juggling a long time ago,,but long before that, I was a golfer, and that's what I was, a golfer.,And as a golfer and as a kid,,one of the things that really sort of seeped into my pores,,that I sort of lived my whole life, is process.,And it's the process of learning things.,One of the great things was that my father was an avid golfer, but he was lefty.,And he had a real passion for golf,,and he also created this whole mythology,about Ben Hogan and various things.,Well, I learned a lot about interesting things,that I knew nothing about at the time, but grew to know stuff about.,And that was the mythology of skill. 
 So, one of the things that I love to do is to explore skill.,And since Richard put me on this whole thing with music --,I'm supposed to actually be doing a project with Tod Machover,with the MIT Media Lab -- it relates a lot to music.,But Tod couldn't come and the project is sort of somewhere,,I'm not sure whether it's happening the way we thought, or not.,But I'm going to explore skill, and juggling,,and basically visual music, I guess.,OK, you can start the music, thanks. 
 (Music) 
 (Applause) 
 Thanks. Thank you. Now, juggling can be a lot of fun;,play with skill and play with space, play with rhythm.,And you can turn the mike on now. I'm going to do a couple of pieces.,I do a big piece in a triangle,and these are three sections from it.,Part of the challenge was to try to understand rhythm and space,using not just my hands -- because a lot of juggling is hand-oriented --,but using the rhythm of my body and feet,,and controlling the balls with my feet. 
 (Applause) 
 Thanks. Now, this next section was an attempt to explore space.,You see, I think Richard said something about people that are against something.,Well, a lot of people think jugglers defy gravity or do stuff.,Well, I kind of, from my childhood and golf and all that,,it's a process of joining with forces.,And so what I'd like to do is try to figure out,how to join with the space through the technique.,So juggling gravity -- up, down.,If you figure out what up and down really are,,it's a complex physical set of skills,to be able to throw a ball down and up and everything,,but then you add in sideways. 
 (Applause) 
 Now, I look at it somewhat as a way -- when you learn juggling,what you learn is how to feel with your eyes, and see with your hands,because you're not looking at your hands,,you're looking at where the balls are or you're looking at the audience.,So this next part is really a way of understanding space and rhythm,,with the obvious reference to the feet,,but it's also time -- where the feet were, where the balls were. 
 (Applause) 
 Thanks. So, visual music: rhythm and complexity.,I'm going to build towards complexity now.,Juggling three balls is simple and normal. 
 (Laughter) 
 Excuse me. 
 (Laughter) 
 We're jugglers, OK. And remember, you're transposing,,you're getting into a subculture here. 
 (Laughter) 
 And juggling -- the balls cross and all that.,OK, if you keep them in their assigned paths you get parallel lines,of different heights, but then hopefully even rhythm.,And you can change the rhythm -- good, Michael.,You can change the rhythm, if you get out of the lights.,OK? Change the rhythm, so it's even.,Or you can go back and change the height. Now, skill.,But you're boxed in, if you can only do it up and down that way.,So, you've got to go after the space down there.,OK, then you've got to combine them,,because then you have the whole spatial palette in front of you.,And then you get crazy. 
 (Applause) 
 Now, I'm actually going to ask you to try something,,so you've got to pay attention. Complexity:,if you spend enough time doing something, time slows down,or your skill increases, so your perceptions change.,It's learning skills -- like being in a high-speed car crash.,Things slow down as you learn, as you learn, as you learn.,You may not be able to affect it, it almost drifts on you. It goes.,But that's the closest approximation I can have to it. 
 So, complexity. Now, how many here are jugglers?,OK, so most of you are going to have a similar reaction to this.,OK? And whoever laughed there --,you understood it completely, right? 
 (Laughter) 
 No, it looks like a mess. It looks like a mess with a guy there,,who's got his hands around that mess, OK.,Well, that's what juggling is about, right?,It's being able to do something that other people can't do or can't understand.,All right. So, that's one way of doing it, which is five balls down.,OK? Another way is the outside.,And you could play with the rhythm.,Same pattern.,Make it faster and smaller.,Make it wider.,Make it narrower.,Bring it back up.,OK. It's done. Thanks. 
 (Applause) 
 Now, what I wanted to get to is that you're all very bright, very tactile.,I have no idea how computer-oriented or three-dimensionally-oriented you are,,but let's try something.,OK, so since you all don't understand what the five-ball pattern is,,I'm going to give you a little clue.,Enough of a clue? So, you get the pattern, right? OK. 
 (Laughter) 
 You're not getting off that easy. All right?,Now, do me a favor: follow the ball that I ask you to follow.,Green.,Yellow.,Pink.,White.,OK, you can do that? Yeah? OK. 
 Now, let's actually learn something.,Actually, let me put you in that area of learning, which is very insecure.,You want to do it? Yeah? OK.,Hands out in front of you. Palms up, together.,What you're going to learn is this. 
 (Laughter) 
 OK? So what I want you to do is just listen to me and do it.,Index finger, middle finger, ring, little.,Little, ring, middle, index. And then open.,Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.,A little bit faster.,Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.,Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. 
 (Laughter) 
 All right. A lot of different learning processes going on in here. 
 (Laughter) 
 One learning process that I see is this -- 
 (Laughter) 
 OK. Another learning process that I see is this -- 
 (Laughter) 
 OK. So, everybody take a deep breath in, breath out. OK.,Now, one more time, and --,finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. Open.,Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. OK.,Shake your hands out. 
 Now, I assume a lot of you spend a lot of time at a computer.,OK? So, what you're doing is, you're going la, la, la,,and you're getting this. OK?,So that's exactly what I'm going to ask you to do,,but in a slightly different way. You're going to combine it.,So what I want you to do is -- fingers.,I'll tell you what to do with your fingers, same thing.,But I want you to do is also, with your eyes,,is follow the colored ball that I ask you to follow. 
 (Laughter) 
 OK? Here we go.,So, we're going to start off looking at the white ball --,and I'm going to tell you which color,,and I'm also going to tell you to go with your fingers. OK?,So white ball and --,finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. Pink.,Finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger. Green.,Finger, finger, finger, finger. Yellow.,Finger, finger, finger, pink or finger.,Pink, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger, finger.,All right. 
 (Applause) 
 How did you do? Well? OK. The reason I wanted you to do this is,because that's actually what most people face throughout their lives,,a moment of learning, a moment of challenge.,It's a moment that you can't make sense of.,Why the hell should I learn this? OK?,Does it really have anything to do with anything in my life?,You know, I can't decipher -- is it fun? Is it challenging? Am I supposed to cheat? 
 (Laughter) 
 You know, what are you supposed to do?,You've got somebody up here who is the operative principle,of doing that for his whole life. OK?,Trying to figure that stuff out. But is it going to get you anywhere?,It's just a moment. That's all it is, a moment. OK?,I'm going to change the script for one second. Just let me do this.,I don't need music for it. Talking about time in a moment.,There's a piece that I recently developed which was all about that,,a moment. And what I do as a creative artist,is I develop vocabularies or languages of moving objects. 
 What I've done for you here, I developed a lot of those tricks,and I put the choreography together,,but they're not original techniques.,Now, I'm going to start showing you some original techniques,that come from the work that I've developed. OK?,So, a moment, how would you define a moment?,Well, as a juggler, what I wanted to do was create something,that was representational of a moment. 
 Ahhh.,All right, I'm going to get on my knees and do it.,So, a moment. 
 (Rattling) 
 OK? And then, what I did as a juggler was say,,OK, what can I do to make that something,that is dependent on something else, another dynamic. 
 (Rattling) 
 So, a moment. 
 (Rattling) 
 Another moment. 
 (Rattling) 
 Excuse me, still getting there. A moment that travels. 
 (Rattling) 
 A moment -- no, we'll try that again. It separates, and comes back together.,Time. How can you look at time?,And what do you dedicate it to, in exploring a particular thing?,Well, obviously, there's something in here,,and you can all have a guess as to what it is.,There's a mystery. There's a mystery in the moment.,And it has to settle. And then it's dependent on something else.,And then it comes to rest. Just a little thing about time. 
 Now, this has expanded into a much bigger piece,,because I use ramps of different parabolas that I roll the balls on,while I'm keeping time with this.,But I just thought I'd talk about a moment. 
 (Applause) 
 All right. OK. Can we show the video of the triangle?,Are we ready to do that? Yes?,This is the piece that I told you about.,It's a much bigger piece that I do exploring the space of a geometric triangle. 
 (Applause) 
 Thanks. The only thing I'll say about the last session is,,you ever try juggling and driving the car with your knees,at 120 miles an hour? 
 (Laughter) 
 The only other thing is, it was a real shock.,I always drove motorcycles. And when I bought my first car, it shocked me,that it cost three times more than my parents' house. Interesting. 
 Anyway, balance:,constant movement to find an approach to stillness.,Cheating. 
 (Laughter) 
 Balance: making up the rules so you can't cheat,,so you learn to approach stillness with different parts of your body.,To have a conversation with it. To speak. To listen. 
 (Laughter) 
 Hup. Now, it's dependent on rhythm,,and keeping a center of balance. When it falls, going underneath.,So, there's a rhythm to it.,The rhythm can get much smaller.,As your skill increases, you learn to find those tinier spaces,,those tinier movements. Thanks. 
 (Applause) 
 Now, I'm going to show you the beginnings of a piece,that is about balance in some ways, and also --,oh, actually, if you're bored, not here, here's one use for it. 
 (Laughter) 
 You can go with the "Sticks One" music. 
 (Music) 
 (Applause) 
 Thanks. That has a certain kind of balance to it, which is all about plumb.,I apprenticed with a carpenter and learned about plumb, square and level.,And they influenced that, and this next piece, which I'll do a little segment of.,"Two Sticks," you can go with it. Thanks.,Which is again exploring space, or the lines in space. 
 (Music) 
 (Applause) 
 Working with space and the lines in space in a different way.,Oh, let's see here. 
 (Applause) 
 So, I'll come back to that in a second. But working with one ball,,now, what if you attach something to it, or change it.,This is a little thing that I made,because I really like the idea of curves and balls together.,And then creating space and the rhythm of space,,using the surface of the balls, the surface of the arms.,Just a little toy. Which leads me to the next thing,,which is --,what have I got here? OK. All right. 
 I'm actually leading up to something,,the newest thing that I'm working on. This is not it.,This is exploring geometry and the rhythm of shape. 
 (Applause) 
 Now, what I just did was I worked with the mathematics --,the diameter and the circumference.,Sometimes these pieces are mathematical, in that way,that I look at a shape and say, what about if I use this and this and this.,Sometimes what happens in life affects my choice,of objects that I try to work with. 
 The next piece that I'm going to do -- which is the cylinders piece,,if you want to get that up --,it has to do with cylinder seals from about 5,000 years ago,,which were stones with designs that were used to roll over wet clay,with all sorts of great designs. I love ceramics and all of that.,It's a combination of that, the beauty of that, the shape,,and the stories that were involved in it,,as well as the fact that they protected the contents. 
 The second influence on this piece came from recycling,and looking into a tin can recycling bin,and seeing all that beautiful emptiness.,So, if you want to go with the music for cylinders. 
 (Music) 
 (Applause) 
 Talking about geometry and everything,,if you take the circle and you split it in half --,can you run "S-Curve music?",I'm going to do just a short version of it.,Circles split in half and rotated, and mythology. 
 (Music) 
 (Applause) 
 Anyway, that piece also has a kinetic sculpture in the middle of it,,and I dance around a small stage so --,two minutes, just to end? The latest piece that I'm working on --,what I love is that I never know what I'm working on, why I'm working on it.,They're not ideas, they're instincts.,And the latest thing that I'm working on -- 
 (Clattering) -- 
 is something really -- I don't know what it is yet.,And that's good. I like not to know for as long as possible.,Well, because then it tells me the truth,,instead of me imposing the truth.,And what it is, is working with both positive and negative space,but also with these curves.,And what it involves,,and I don't know if my hands are too beaten up to do it or not,,but I'll do a little bit of it. 
 It initially started off with me stacking these things,,bunches of them, and then playing with the sense of space,,of filling in the space. And then it started changing,,and become folding on themselves.,And then changing levels.,Because my attempt is to make visual instruments,,not to just make -- I'll try one other thing.,For work in three dimensions, with your perceptions of space and time.,Now, I don't know exactly where it's going,,but I've got a bit of effort involved in this thing.,And it's going to change as I go through it.,But I really like it, it feels right.,This may not be the right shape, and -- look at this shape,,and then I'll show you the first design I ever put to it,,just to see, just to play,,because I love all different kinds of things to play with.,Let's see here.,To work with the positive and negative in a different way.,And to change, and to change. 
 So, I'm off in my new direction with this to explore rhythm and space.,We'll see what I come up with. Thanks for having me. 
 (Applause)So, what I'd like to talk about is something,that was very dear to Kahn's heart, which is:,how do we discover what is really particular about a project?,How do you discover the uniqueness of a project as unique as a person?,Because it seems to me that finding this uniqueness,has to do with dealing with the whole force of globalization;,that the particular is central to finding the uniqueness of place,and the uniqueness of a program in a building. 
 And so I'll take you to Wichita, Kansas,,where I was asked some years ago to do a science museum,on a site, right downtown by the river.,And I thought the secret of the site was to make the building of the river, part of the river.,Unfortunately, though, the site was separated from the river by McLean Boulevard,so I suggested, "Let's reroute McLean,",and that gave birth instantly to Friends of McLean Boulevard.,(Laughter),And it took six months to reroute it. 
 The first image I showed the building committee was,this astronomic observatory of Jantar Mantar in Jaipur,because I talked about what makes a building a building of science.,And it seemed to me that this structure -- complex, rich and yet,totally rational: it's an instrument -- had something to do with science,,and somehow a building for science should be different and unique and speak of that.,And so my first sketch after I left was to say,,"Let's cut the channel and make an island and make an island building.",And I got all excited and came back, and,they sort of looked at me in dismay and said, "An island?,This used to be an island -- Ackerman Island --,and we filled in the channel during the Depression to create jobs.",(Laughter) 
 And so the process began and they said,,"You can't put it all on an island;,some of it has to be on the mainland because,we don't want to turn our back to the community.",And there emerged a design: the galleries sort of forming an island,and you could walk through them or on the roof.,And there were all kinds of exciting features:,you could come in through the landside buildings,,walk through the galleries into playgrounds in the landscape.,If you were cheap you could walk on top of a bridge to the roof,,peek in the exhibits and then get totally seduced,,come back and pay the five dollars admission.,(Laughter),And the client was happy -- well, sort of happy,because we were four million dollars over the budget, but essentially happy. 
 But I was still troubled, and I was troubled because I felt this was capricious.,It was complex, but there was something capricious about its complexity.,It was, what I would say, compositional complexity,,and I felt that if I had to fulfill what I talked about --,a building for science -- there had to be some kind of a generating idea,,some kind of a generating geometry.,And this gave birth to the idea of having toroidal generating geometry,,one with its center deep in the earth for the landside building,and a toroid with its center in the sky for the island building.,A toroid, for those who don't know,,is the surface of a doughnut or, for some of us, a bagel.,And out of this idea started spinning off many,,many kinds of variations of different plans and possibilities,,and then the plan itself evolved in relationship to the exhibits,,and you see the intersection of the plan with the toroidal geometry. 
 And finally the building -- this is the model.,And when there were complaints about budget, I said,,"Well, it's worth doing the island because you get twice for your money: reflections.",And here's the building as it opened,,with a channel overlooking downtown, and as seen from downtown.,And the bike route's going right through the building,,so those traveling the river would see the exhibits and be drawn to the building.,The toroidal geometry made for a very efficient building:,every beam in this building is the same radius, all laminated wood.,Every wall, every concrete wall is resisting the stresses and supporting the building.,Every piece of the building works.,These are the galleries with the light coming in through the skylights,,and at night, and on opening day. 
 Going back to 1976.,(Applause),In 1976, I was asked to design a children's memorial museum,in a Holocaust museum in Yad Vashem in Jerusalem,,which you see here the campus.,I was asked to do a building,,and I was given all the artifacts of clothing and drawings.,And I felt very troubled.,I worked on it for months and I couldn't deal with it,because I felt people were coming out of the historic museum,,they are totally saturated with information,and to see yet another museum with information,,it would make them just unable to digest.,And so I made a counter-proposal: 
 I said, "No building." There was a cave on the site; we tunnel into the hill,,descend through the rock into an underground chamber.,There's an anteroom with photographs of children who perished,and then you come into a large space.,There is a single candle flickering in the center;,by an arrangement of reflective glasses, it reflects into infinity in all directions.,You walk through the space, a voice reads the names,,ages and place of birth of the children.,This voice does not repeat for six months.,And then you descend to light and to the north and to life. 
 Well, they said, "People won't understand,,they'll think it's a discotheque. You can't do that.",And they shelved the project. And it sat there for 10 years,,and then one day Abe Spiegel from Los Angeles,,who had lost his three-year-old son at Auschwitz,,came, saw the model, wrote the check and it got built 10 years later. 
 So, many years after that in 1998,,I was on one of my monthly trips to Jerusalem,and I got a call from the foreign ministry saying,,"We've got the Chief Minister of the Punjab here.,He is on a state visit. We took him on a visit to Yad Vashem,,we took him to the children's memorial; he was extremely moved.,He's demanding to meet the architect. Could you come down and meet him in Tel Aviv?",And I went down and Chief Minister Badal said to me,,"We Sikhs have suffered a great deal, as you have Jews.,I was very moved by what I saw today.,We are going to build our national museum to tell the story of our people;,we're about to embark on that.,I'd like you to come and design it." 
 And so, you know, it's one of those things that you don't take too seriously.,But two weeks later, I was in this little town, Anandpur Sahib,,outside Chandigarh, the capital of the Punjab,,and the temple and also next to it the fortress,that the last guru of the Sikhs, Guru Gobind, died in,as he wrote the Khalsa, which is their holy scripture.,And I got to work and they took me somewhere down there,,nine kilometers away from the town and the temple,,and said, "That's where we have chosen the location." 
 And I said, "This just doesn't make any sense.,The pilgrims come here by the hundreds of thousands --,they're not going to get in trucks and buses and go down there.,Let's get back to the town and walk to the site.",And I recommended they do it right there, on that hill,and this hill, and bridge all the way into the town.,And, as things are a little easier in India, the site was purchased within a week,and we were working.,(Laughter) 
 And my proposal was to split the museum into two --,the permanent exhibits at one end, the auditorium, library,,and changing exhibitions on the other --,to flood the valley into a series of water gardens,and to link it all to the fort and to the downtown.,And the structures rise from the sand cliffs --,they're built in concrete and sandstones; the roofs are stainless steel --,they are facing south and reflecting light towards the temple itself,,pedestrians crisscross from one side to the other.,And as you come from the north, it is all masonry growing out of the sand cliffs,as you come from the Himalayas and evoking the tradition of the fortress. 
 And then I went away for four months,and there was going to be groundbreaking.,And I came back and, lo and behold, the little model I'd left behind,had been built ten times bigger for public display on site,and ... the bridge was built!,(Laughter),Within the working drawings!,And half a million people gathered for the celebrations;,you can see them on the site itself as the foundations are beginning.,I was renamed Safdie Singh. And there it is under construction;,there are 1,800 workers at work and it will be finished in two years. 
 Back to Yad Vashem three years ago. After all this episode began,,Yad Vashem decided to rebuild completely the historic museum,because now Washington was built -- the Holocaust Museum in Washington --,and that museum is so much more comprehensive in terms of information.,And Yad Vashem needs to deal with three million visitors a year at this point.,They said, "Let's rebuild the museum.",But of course, the Sikhs might give you a job on a platter -- the Jews make it hard:,international competition, phase one, phase two, phase three.,(Laughter) 
 And again, I felt kind of uncomfortable with the notion,that a building the size of the Washington building --,50,000 square feet -- will sit on that fragile hill,and that we will go into galleries -- rooms with doors,and sort of familiar rooms -- to tell the story of the Holocaust.,And I proposed that we cut through the mountain. That was my first sketch.,Just cut the whole museum through the mountain --,enter from one side of the mountain,,come out on the other side of the mountain --,and then bring light through the mountain into the chambers. 
 And here you see the model:,a reception building and some underground parking.,You cross a bridge, you enter this triangular room, 60 feet high,,which cuts right into the hill,and extends right through as you go towards the north.,And all of it, then, all the galleries are underground,,and you see the openings for the light.,And at night, just one line of light cuts through the mountain,,which is a skylight on top of that triangle.,And all the galleries,,as you move through them and so on, are below grade.,And there are chambers carved in the rock --,concrete walls, stone, the natural rock when possible -- with the light shafts.,This is actually a Spanish quarry, which sort of inspired,the kind of spaces that these galleries could be.,And then, coming towards the north, it opens up:,it bursts out of the mountain into, again, a view of light and of the city,and of the Jerusalem hills. 
 I'd like to conclude with a project I've been working on for two months.,It's the headquarters for the Institute of Peace in Washington,,the U.S. Institute of Peace.,The site chosen is across from the Lincoln Memorial;,you see it there directly on the Mall. It's the last building on the Mall,,on access of the Roosevelt Bridge that comes in from Virginia.,That too was a competition, and it is something I'm just beginning to work on. 
 But one recognized the kind of uniqueness of the site.,If it were to be anywhere in Washington,,it would be an office building, a conference center,,a place for negotiating peace and so on -- all of which the building is --,but by virtue of the choice of putting it on the Mall and by the Lincoln Memorial,,this becomes the structure that is the symbol of peace on the Mall.,And that was a lot of heat to deal with. 
 The first sketch recognizes that the building is many spaces --,spaces where research goes on, conference centers,,a public building because it will be a museum devoted to peacemaking --,and these are the drawings that we submitted for the competition,,the plans showing the spaces which radiate outwards from the entry.,You see the structure as, in the sequence of structures on the Mall,,very transparent and inviting and looking in.,And then as you enter it again, looking in all directions towards the city.,And what I felt about that building is that it really was a building,that had to do with a lightness of being -- to quote Kundera --,that it had to do with whiteness,,it had to do with a certain dynamic quality and it had to do with optimism.,And this is where it is; it's sort of evolving. 
 Studies for the structure of the roof,,which demands maybe new materials:,how to make it white, how to make it translucent, how to make it glowing,,how to make it not capricious.,And here studying, in three dimensions,,how to give some kind, again, of order, a structure;,not something you feel you could just change,because you stop the design of that particular process.,And so it goes. 
 I'd like to conclude by saying something ...,(Applause),I'd like to conclude by relating all of what I've said to the term "beauty.",And I know it is not a fashionable term these days,,and certainly not fashionable in the discourse of architectural schools,,but it seems to me that all this, in one way or the other, is a search for beauty.,Beauty in the most profound sense of fit.,I have a quote that I like by a morphologist, 1917,,Theodore Cook, who said, "Beauty connotes humanity.,We call a natural object beautiful because we see,that its form expresses fitness, the perfect fulfillment of function.",Well, I would have said the perfect fulfillment of purpose.,Nevertheless, beauty as the kind of fit; something that tells us,that all the forces that have to do with our natural environment,have been fulfilled -- and our human environment -- for that. 
 Twenty years ago, in a conference Richard and I were at together,,I wrote a poem, which seems to me to still hold for me today.,"He who seeks truth shall find beauty. He who seeks beauty shall find vanity.,He who seeks order shall find gratification.,He who seeks gratification shall be disappointed.,He who considers himself the servant of his fellow beings,shall find the joy of self-expression. He who seeks self-expression,shall fall into the pit of arrogance.,Arrogance is incompatible with nature.,Through nature, the nature of the universe and the nature of man,,we shall seek truth. If we seek truth, we shall find beauty." 
 Thank you very much. (Applause)
