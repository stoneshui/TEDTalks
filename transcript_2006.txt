I'm going to talk to you today about,hopefully converting fear into hope.,When we go to the physician today --,when we go to the doctor's office and we walk in,,there are words that we just don't want to hear.,There are words that we're truly afraid of.,Diabetes, cancer, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's,,heart failure, lung failure --,things that we know are debilitating diseases,,for which there's relatively little that can be done. 
 And what I want to lay out for you today is,a different way of thinking about how to treat debilitating disease,,why it's important,,why without it perhaps our health care system will melt down,if you think it already hasn't,,and where we are clinically today, and where we might go tomorrow,,and what some of the hurdles are.,And we're going to do all of that in 18 minutes, I promise. 
 I want to start with this slide,,because this slide sort of tells the story the way Science Magazine thinks of it.,This was an issue from 2002,that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human.,It was basically a regenerative medicine issue.,Regenerative medicine is an extraordinarily simple concept,that everybody can understand.,It's simply accelerating the pace at which the body heals itself,to a clinically relevant timescale.,So we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there.,We know that if we have a damaged hip, you can put an artificial hip in.,And this is the idea that Science Magazine used on their front cover. 
 This is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine.,This is not regenerative medicine.,Regenerative medicine is what Business Week put up,when they did a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago.,The idea is that instead of figuring out how to ameliorate symptoms,with devices and drugs and the like --,and I'll come back to that theme a few times --,instead of doing that, we will regenerate lost function of the body,by regenerating the function of organs and damaged tissue.,So that at the end of the treatment,,you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment. 
 Very few good ideas -- if you agree that this is a good idea --,very few good ideas are truly novel.,And this is just the same.,If you look back in history,,Charles Lindbergh, who was better known for flying airplanes,,was actually one of the first people,along with Alexis Carrel, one of the Nobel Laureates from Rockefeller,,to begin to think about, could you culture organs?,And they published this book in 1937,,where they actually began to think about,,what could you do in bio-reactors to grow whole organs?,We've come a long way since then.,I'm going to share with you some of the exciting work that's going on. 
 But before doing that, what I'd like to do,is share my depression about the health care system,and the need for this with you.,Many of the talks yesterday talked about,improving the quality of life, and reducing poverty,,and essentially increasing life expectancy all around the globe.,One of the challenges is that the richer we are, the longer we live.,And the longer we live, the more expensive it is,to take care of our diseases as we get older. 
 This is simply the wealth of a country,versus the percent of population over the age of 65.,And you can basically see that the richer a country is,,the older the people are within it.,Why is this important?,And why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now?,If the average age of your population is 30,,then the average kind of disease that you have to treat,is maybe a broken ankle every now and again,,maybe a little bit of asthma.,If the average age in your country is 45 to 55,,now the average person is looking at diabetes,,early-onset diabetes, heart failure, coronary artery disease --,things that are inherently more difficult to treat,,and much more expensive to treat. 
 Just have a look at the demographics in the U.S. here.,This is from "The Untied States of America.",In 1930, there were 41 workers per retiree.,41 people who were basically outside of being really sick,,paying for the one retiree who was experiencing debilitating disease.,In 2010, two workers per retiree in the U.S.,And this is matched in every industrialized, wealthy country in the world.,How can you actually afford to treat patients,when the reality of getting old looks like this? 
 This is age versus cost of health care.,And you can see that right around age 45, 40 to 45,,there's a sudden spike in the cost of health care.,It's actually quite interesting. If you do the right studies,,you can look at how much you as an individual spend on your own health care,,plotted over your lifetime.,And about seven years before you're about to die, there's a spike.,And you can actually --,(Laughter),-- we won't get into that.,(Laughter) 
 There are very few things, very few things that you can really do,that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of diseases,and experience what I would call healthy aging.,I'd suggest there are four things,,and none of these things include an insurance system or a legal system.,All those things do is change who pays.,They don't actually change what the actual cost of the treatment is. 
 One thing you can do is not treat. You can ration health care.,We won't talk about that anymore. It's too depressing.,You can prevent.,Obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention. 
 But perhaps most interesting, to me anyway, and most important,,is the idea of diagnosing a disease much earlier on in the progression,,and then treating the disease to cure the disease,instead of treating a symptom.,Think of it in terms of diabetes, for instance.,Today, with diabetes, what do we do?,We diagnose the disease eventually, once it becomes symptomatic,,and then we treat the symptom for 10, 20, 30, 40 years.,And we do OK. Insulin's a pretty good therapy.,But eventually it stops working,,and diabetes leads to a predictable onset of debilitating disease. 
 Why couldn't we just inject the pancreas with something,to regenerate the pancreas early on in the disease,,perhaps even before it was symptomatic?,And it might be a little bit expensive at the time that we did it,,but if it worked, we would truly be able to do something different. 
 This video, I think, gets across the concept that I'm talking about quite dramatically.,This is a newt re-growing its limb.,If a newt can do this kind of thing, why can't we?,I'll actually show you some more important features,about limb regeneration in a moment.,But what we're talking about in regenerative medicine,is doing this in every organ system of the body,,for tissues and for organs themselves.,So today's reality is that if we get sick,,the message is we will treat your symptoms,,and you need to adjust to a new way of life. 
 I would pose to you that tomorrow --,and when tomorrow is we could debate,,but it's within the foreseeable future --,we will talk about regenerative rehabilitation.,There's a limb prosthetic up here,,similar actually one on the soldier,that's come back from Iraq.,There are 370 soldiers that have come back from Iraq that have lost limbs.,Imagine if instead of facing that, they could actually,face the regeneration of that limb.,It's a wild concept.,I'll show you where we are at the moment in working towards that concept. 
 But it's applicable, again, to every organ system.,How can we do that?,The way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body.,We need to learn to speak the body's language.,And to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fetus.,A mammalian fetus, if it loses a limb during the first trimester of pregnancy,,will re-grow that limb.,So our DNA has the capacity to do these kinds of wound-healing mechanisms.,It's a natural process,,but it is lost as we age.,In a child, before the age of about six months,,if they lose their fingertip in an accident,,they'll re-grow their fingertip.,By the time they're five, they won't be able to do that anymore. 
 So to engage in that conversation with the body,,we need to speak the body's language.,And there are certain tools in our toolbox that allow us to do this today.,I'm going to give you an example of three of these tools,through which to converse with the body. 
 The first is cellular therapies.,Clearly, we heal ourselves in a natural process,,using cells to do most of the work.,Therefore, if we can find the right cells,and implant them in the body, they may do the healing.,Secondly, we can use materials.,We heard yesterday about the importance of new materials.,If we can invent materials, design materials,,or extract materials from a natural environment,,then we might be able to have those materials induce the body to heal itself.,And finally, we may be able to use smart devices,that will offload the work of the body and allow it to heal. 
 I'm going to show you an example of each of these,,and I'm going to start with materials.,Steve Badylak -- who's at the University of Pittsburgh --,about a decade ago had a remarkable idea.,And that idea was that the small intestine of a pig,,if you threw away all the cells,,and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active,,may contain all of the necessary factors and signals,that would signal the body to heal itself.,And he asked a very important question.,He asked the question,,if I take that material, which is a natural material,that usually induces healing in the small intestine,,and I place it somewhere else on a person's body,,would it give a tissue-specific response,,or would it make small intestine if I tried to make a new ear? 
 I wouldn't be telling you this story if it weren't compelling.,The picture I'm about to show you,is a compelling picture.,(Laughter),However, for those of you that are even the slightest bit squeamish --,even though you may not like to admit it in front of your friends --,the lights are down. This is a good time to look at your feet,,check your Blackberry, do anything other than look at the screen.,(Laughter) 
 What I'm about to show you is a diabetic ulcer.,And although -- it's good to laugh before we look at this.,This is the reality of diabetes.,I think a lot of times we hear about diabetics, diabetic ulcers,,we just don't connect the ulcer with the eventual treatment,,which is amputation, if you can't heal it.,So I'm going to put the slide up now. It won't be up for long.,This is a diabetic ulcer. It's tragic.,The treatment for this is amputation.,This is an older lady. She has cancer of the liver as well as diabetes,,and has decided to die with what' s left of her body intact. 
 And this lady decided, after a year of attempted treatment of that ulcer,,that she would try this new therapy that Steve invented.,That's what the wound looked like 11 weeks later.,That material contained only natural signals.,And that material induced the body to switch back on a healing response,that it didn't have before. 
 There's going to be a couple more distressing slides for those of you --,I'll let you know when you can look again.,This is a horse. The horse is not in pain.,If the horse was in pain, I wouldn't show you this slide.,The horse just has another nostril that's developed,because of a riding accident.,Just a few weeks after treatment --,in this case, taking that material, turning it into a gel,,and packing that area, and then repeating the treatment a few times --,and the horse heals up.,And if you took an ultrasound of that area, it would look great. 
 Here's a dolphin where the fin's been re-attached.,There are now 400,000 patients around the world,who have used that material to heal their wounds.,Could you regenerate a limb?,DARPA just gave Steve 15 million dollars to lead an eight-institution project,to begin the process of asking that question. 
 And I'll show you the 15 million dollar picture.,This is a 78 year-old man who's lost the end of his fingertip.,Remember that I mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips.,After treatment that's what it looks like.,This is happening today.,This is clinically relevant today.,There are materials that do this. Here are the heart patches. 
 But could you go a little further?,Could you, say, instead of using material,,can I take some cells along with the material,,and remove a damaged piece of tissue,,put a bio-degradable material on there?,You can see here a little bit of heart muscle beating in a dish.,This was done by Teruo Okano at Tokyo Women's Hospital.,He can actually grow beating tissue in a dish.,He chills the dish, it changes its properties,and he peels it right out of the dish.,It's the coolest stuff. 
 Now I'm going to show you cell-based regeneration.,And what I'm going to show you here,is stem cells being removed from the hip of a patient.,Again, if you're squeamish, you don't want to watch.,But this one's kind of cool.,So this is a bypass operation, just like what Al Gore had,,with a difference.,In this case, at the end of the bypass operation,,you're going to see the stem cells from the patient,that were removed at the beginning of the procedure,being injected directly into the heart of the patient.,And I'm standing up here because at one point,I'm going to show you just how early this technology is.,Here go the stem cells, right into the beating heart of the patient.,And if you look really carefully,,it's going to be right around this point,you'll actually see a back-flush.,You see the cells coming back out.,We need all sorts of new technology, new devices,,to get the cells to the right place at the right time. 
 Just a little bit of data, a tiny bit of data.,This was a randomized trial.,At this time this was an N of 20. Now there's an N of about 100.,Basically, if you take an extremely sick patient,and you give them a bypass, they get a little bit better.,If you give them stem cells as well as their bypass,,for these particular patients, they became asymptomatic.,These are now two years out.,The coolest thing would be is if you could diagnose the disease early,,and prevent the onset of the disease to a bad state. 
 This is the same procedure, but now done minimally invasively,,with only three holes in the body where they're taking the heart,and simply injecting stem cells through a laparoscopic procedure.,There go the cells.,We don't have time to go into all of those details,,but basically, that works too.,You can take patients who are less sick,,and bring them back to an almost asymptomatic state,through that kind of therapy. 
 Here's another example of stem-cell therapy that isn't quite clinical yet,,but I think very soon will be.,This is the work of Kacey Marra from Pittsburgh,,along with a number of colleagues around the world.,They've decided that liposuction fluid,,which -- in the United States, we have a lot of liposuction fluid.,(Laughter),It's a great source of stem cells.,Stem cells are packed in that liposuction fluid.,So you could go in, you could get your tummy-tuck.,Out comes the liposuction fluid,,and in this case, the stem cells are isolated and turned into neurons.,All done in the lab.,And I think fairly soon, you will see patients being treated,with their own fat-derived, or adipose-derived, stem cells. 
 I talked before about the use of devices,to dramatically change the way we treat disease.,Here's just one example before I close up.,This is equally tragic.,We have a very abiding and heartbreaking partnership,with our colleagues at the Institute for Surgical Research in the US Army,,who have to treat the now 11,000 kids that have come back from Iraq.,Many of those patients are very severely burned. 
 And if there's anything that's been learned about burn,,it's that we don't know how to treat it.,Everything that is done to treat burn --,basically we do a sodding approach.,We make something over here,,and then we transplant it onto the site of the wound,,and we try and get the two to take.,In this case here, a new, wearable bio-reactor has been designed --,it should be tested clinically later this year at ISR --,by Joerg Gerlach in Pittsburgh.,And that bio-reactor will lay down in the wound bed.,The gun that you see there sprays cells.,That's going to spray cells over that area.,The reactor will serve to fertilize the environment,,deliver other things as well at the same time,,and therefore we will seed that lawn,,as opposed to try the sodding approach.,It's a completely different way of doing it. 
 So my 18 minutes is up.,So let me finish up with some good news,,and maybe a little bit of bad news.,The good news is that this is happening today.,It's very powerful work.,Clearly the images kind of get that across.,It's incredibly difficult because it's highly inter-disciplinary.,Almost every field of science engineering and clinical practice,is involved in trying to get this to happen. 
 A number of governments, and a number of regions,,have recognized that this is a new way to treat disease.,The Japanese government were perhaps the first,,when they decided to invest first 3 billion,,later another 2 billion in this field.,It's no coincidence.,Japan is the oldest country on earth in terms of its average age.,They need this to work or their health system dies.,So they're putting a lot of strategic investment focused in this area.,The European Union, same thing.,China, the same thing.,China just launched a national tissue-engineering center.,The first year budget was 250 million US dollars. 
 In the United States we've had a somewhat different approach.,(Laughter),Oh, for Al Gore to come and be in the real world as president.,We've had a different approach.,And the approach has basically been to just sort of fund things as they come along.,But there's been no strategic investment,to bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way. 
 And I'm going to finish up with a quote, maybe a little cheap shot,,at the director of the NIH, who's a very charming man.,Myself and Jay Vacanti from Harvard,went to visit with him and a number of his directors of his institute,just a few months ago,,to try and convince him that it was time to take just a little piece,of that 27.5 billion dollars that he's going to get next year,and focus it, in a strategic way, to make sure we can accelerate the pace,at which these things get to patients.,And at the end of a very testy meeting,,what the NIH director said was,,"Your vision is larger than our appetite.",I'd like to close by saying that no one's going to change our vision,,but together we can change his appetite.,Thank you.What technology can we really apply to reducing global poverty?,And what I found was quite surprising.,We started looking at things like death rates in the 20th century,,and how they'd been improved, and very simple things turned out.,You'd think maybe antibiotics made more difference than clean water,,but it's actually the opposite.,And so very simple things -- off-the-shelf technologies,that we could easily find on the then-early Web --,would clearly make a huge difference to that problem. 
 But I also, in looking at more powerful technologies,and nanotechnology and genetic engineering and other new emerging,kind of digital technologies, became very concerned,about the potential for abuse.,If you think about it, in history, a long, long time ago,we dealt with the problem of an individual abusing another individual.,We came up with something -- the Ten Commandments: Thou shalt not kill.,That's a, kind of a one-on-one thing.,We organized into cities. We had many people.,And to keep the many from tyrannizing the one,,we came up with concepts like individual liberty.,And then, to have to deal with large groups,,say, at the nation-state level,,and we had to have mutual non-aggression,,or through a series of conflicts, we eventually came to,a rough international bargain to largely keep the peace. 
 But now we have a new situation, really what people call,an asymmetric situation, where technology is so powerful,that it extends beyond a nation-state.,It's not the nation-states that have potential access,to mass destruction, but individuals.,And this is a consequence of the fact that these new technologies tend to be digital.,We saw genome sequences.,You can download the gene sequences,of pathogens off the Internet if you want to,,and clearly someone recently -- I saw in a science magazine --,they said, well, the 1918 flu is too dangerous to FedEx around.,If people want to use it in their labs for working on research,,just reconstruct it yourself,,because, you know, it might break in FedEx.,So that this is possible to do this is not deniable. 
 So individuals in small groups super-empowered by access to these,kinds of self-replicating technologies, whether it be biological,or other, are clearly a danger in our world.,And the danger is that they can cause roughly what's a pandemic.,And we really don't have experience with pandemics,,and we're also not very good as a society at acting,to things we don't have direct and sort of gut-level experience with.,So it's not in our nature to pre-act.,And in this case, piling on more technology doesn't solve the problem,,because it only super-empowers people more. 
 So the solution has to be, as people like Russell and Einstein,and others imagine in a conversation that existed,in a much stronger form, I think, early in the 20th century,,that the solution had to be not just the head but the heart.,You know, public policy and moral progress.,The bargain that gives us civilization is a bargain to not use power.,We get our individual rights by society protecting us from others,not doing everything they can do but largely doing only what is legal.,And so to limit the danger of these new things, we have to limit,,ultimately, the ability of individuals,to have access, essentially, to pandemic power.,We also have to have sensible defense, because no limitation,is going to prevent a crazy person from doing something.,And you know, and the troubling thing is that,it's much easier to do something bad than to defend,against all possible bad things,,so the offensive uses really have an asymmetric advantage. 
 So these are the kind of thoughts I was thinking in 1999 and 2000,,and my friends told me I was getting really depressed,,and they were really worried about me.,And then I signed a book contract to write more gloomy thoughts about this,and moved into a hotel room in New York,with one room full of books on the Plague,,and you know, nuclear bombs exploding in New York,where I would be within the circle, and so on.,And then I was there on September 11th,,and I stood in the streets with everyone.,And it was quite an experience to be there.,I got up the next morning and walked out of the city,,and all the sanitation trucks were parked on Houston Street,and ready to go down and start taking the rubble away.,And I walked down the middle, up to the train station,,and everything below 14th Street was closed.,It was quite a compelling experience, but not really, I suppose,,a surprise to someone who'd had his room full of the books.,It was always a surprise that it happened then and there,,but it wasn't a surprise that it happened at all. 
 And everyone then started writing about this.,Thousands of people started writing about this.,And I eventually abandoned the book, and then Chris called me,to talk at the conference. I really don't talk about this anymore,because, you know, there's enough frustrating and depressing things going on.,But I agreed to come and say a few things about this.,And I would say that we can't give up the rule of law,to fight an asymmetric threat, which is what we seem to be doing,because of the present, the people that are in power,,because that's to give up the thing that makes civilization.,And we can't fight the threat in the kind of stupid way we're doing,,because a million-dollar act,causes a billion dollars of damage, causes a trillion dollar response,which is largely ineffective and arguably, probably almost certainly,,has made the problem worse.,So we can't fight the thing with a million-to-one cost,,one-to-a-million cost-benefit ratio. 
 So after giving up on the book -- and I had the great honor,to be able to join Kleiner Perkins about a year ago,,and to work through venture capital on the innovative side,,and to try to find some innovations that could address what I saw as,some of these big problems.,Things where, you know, a factor of 10 difference,can make a factor of 1,000 difference in the outcome.,I've been amazed in the last year at the incredible quality,and excitement of the innovations that have come across my desk.,It's overwhelming at times. I'm very thankful for Google and Wikipedia,so I can understand at least a little of what people are talking about,who come through the doors. 
 But I wanted to share with you three areas,that I'm particularly excited about and that relate to the problems,that I was talking about in the Wired article.,The first is this whole area of education,,and it really relates to what Nicholas was talking about with a $100 computer.,And that is to say that there's a lot of legs left in Moore's Law.,The most advanced transistors today are at 65 nanometers,,and we've seen, and I've had the pleasure to invest,in, companies that give me great confidence that we'll extend Moore's Law,all the way down to roughly the 10 nanometer scale.,Another factor of, say, six in dimensional reduction,,which should give us about another factor of 100 in raw improvement,in what the chips can do. And so, to put that in practical terms,,if something costs about 1,000 dollars today,,say, the best personal computer you can buy, that might be its cost,,I think we can have that in 2020 for 10 dollars. Okay?,Now, just imagine what that $100 computer will be in 2020,as a tool for education. 
 I think the challenge for us is --,I'm very certain that that will happen, the challenge is,,will we develop the kind of educational tools and things with the net,to let us take advantage of that device?,I'd argue today that we have incredibly powerful computers,,but we don't have very good software for them.,And it's only in retrospect, after the better software comes along,,and you take it and you run it on a ten-year-old machine, you say,,God, the machine was that fast?,I remember when they took the Apple Mac interface,and they put it back on the Apple II.,The Apple II was perfectly capable of running that kind of interface,,we just didn't know how to do it at the time.,So given that we know and should believe --,because Moore's Law's been, like, a constant,,I mean, it's just been very predictable progress,over the last 40 years or whatever.,We can know what the computers are going to be like in 2020.,It's great that we have initiatives to say,,let's go create the education and educate people in the world,,because that's a great force for peace.,And we can give everyone in the world a $100 computer,or a $10 computer in the next 15 years. 
 The second area that I'm focusing on is the environmental problem,,because that's clearly going to put a lot of pressure on this world.,We'll hear a lot more about that from Al Gore very shortly.,The thing that we see as the kind of Moore's Law trend,that's driving improvement in our ability to address,the environmental problem is new materials.,We have a challenge, because the urban population is growing,in this century from two billion to six billion,in a very short amount of time. People are moving to the cities.,They all need clean water, they need energy, they need transportation,,and we want them to develop in a green way.,We're reasonably efficient in the industrial sectors.,We've made improvements in energy and resource efficiency,,but the consumer sector, especially in America, is very inefficient.,But these new materials bring such incredible innovations,that there's a strong basis for hope that these things,will be so profitable that they can be brought to the market. 
 And I want to give you a specific example of a new material,that was discovered 15 years ago.,If we take carbon nanotubes, you know, Iijima discovered them in 1991,,they just have incredible properties.,And these are the kinds of things we're going to discover,as we start to engineer at the nano scale.,Their strength: they're almost the strongest material,,tensile strength material known.,They're very, very stiff. They stretch very, very little.,In two dimensions, if you make, like, a fabric out of them,,they're 30 times stronger than Kevlar.,And if you make a three-dimensional structure, like a buckyball,,they have all sorts of incredible properties.,If you shoot a particle at them and knock a hole in them,,they repair themselves; they go zip and they repair the hole,in femtoseconds, which is not -- is really quick.,(Laughter),If you shine a light on them, they produce electricity.,In fact, if you flash them with a camera they catch on fire.,If you put electricity on them, they emit light.,If you run current through them, you can run 1,000 times more current,through one of these than through a piece of metal.,You can make both p- and n-type semiconductors,,which means you can make transistors out of them.,They conduct heat along their length but not across --,well, there is no width, but not in the other direction,if you stack them up; that's a property of carbon fiber also.,If you put particles in them, and they go shooting out the tip --,they're like miniature linear accelerators or electron guns.,The inside of the nanotubes is so small --,the smallest ones are 0.7 nanometers --,that it's basically a quantum world.,It's a strange place inside a nanotube. 
 And so we begin to see, and we've seen business plans already,,where the kind of things Lisa Randall's talking about are in there.,I had one business plan where I was trying to learn more about,Witten's cosmic dimension strings to try to understand,what the phenomenon was going on in this proposed nanomaterial.,So inside of a nanotube, we're really at the limit here.,So what we see is with these and other new materials,that we can do things with different properties -- lighter, stronger --,and apply these new materials to the environmental problems.,New materials that can make water,,new materials that can make fuel cells work better,,new materials that catalyze chemical reactions,,that cut pollution and so on.,Ethanol -- new ways of making ethanol.,New ways of making electric transportation.,The whole green dream -- because it can be profitable.,And we've dedicated -- we've just raised a new fund,,we dedicated 100 million dollars to these kinds of investments.,We believe that Genentech, the Compaq, the Lotus, the Sun,,the Netscape, the Amazon, the Google in these fields,are yet to be found, because this materials revolution,will drive these things forward. 
 The third area that we're working on,,and we just announced last week -- we were all in New York.,We raised 200 million dollars in a specialty fund,to work on a pandemic in biodefense.,And to give you an idea of the last fund that Kleiner raised,was a $400 million fund, so this for us is a very substantial fund.,And what we did, over the last few months -- well, a few months ago,,Ray Kurzweil and I wrote an op-ed in the New York Times,about how publishing the 1918 genome was very dangerous.,And John Doerr and Brook and others got concerned, [unclear],,and we started looking around at what the world was doing,about being prepared for a pandemic. And we saw a lot of gaps. 
 And so we asked ourselves, you know, can we find innovative things,that will go fill these gaps? And Brooks told me in a break here,,he said he's found so much stuff he can't sleep,,because there's so many great technologies out there,,we're essentially buried. And we need them, you know.,We have one antiviral that people are talking about stockpiling,that still works, roughly. That's Tamiflu.,But Tamiflu -- the virus is resistant. It is resistant to Tamiflu.,We've discovered with AIDS we need cocktails to work well,so that the viral resistance -- we need several anti-virals.,We need better surveillance.,We need networks that can find out what's going on.,We need rapid diagnostics so that we can tell if somebody has,a strain of flu which we have only identified very recently.,We've got to be able to make the rapid diagnostics quickly.,We need new anti-virals and cocktails. We need new kinds of vaccines.,Vaccines that are broad spectrum.,Vaccines that we can manufacture quickly.,Cocktails, more polyvalent vaccines.,You normally get a trivalent vaccine against three possible strains.,We need -- we don't know where this thing is going.,We believe that if we could fill these 10 gaps,,we have a chance to help really reduce the risk of a pandemic.,And the difference between a normal flu season and a pandemic,is about a factor of 1,000 in deaths,and certainly enormous economic impact.,So we're very excited because we think we can fund 10,,or speed up 10 projects and see them come to market,in the next couple years that will address this. 
 So if we can address, use technology, help address education,,help address the environment, help address the pandemic,,does that solve the larger problem that I was talking about,in the Wired article? And I'm afraid the answer is really no,,because you can't solve a problem with the management of technology,with more technology.,If we let an unlimited amount of power loose, then we will --,a very small number of people will be able to abuse it.,We can't fight at a million-to-one disadvantage.,So what we need to do is, we need better policy.,And for example, some things we could do,that would be policy solutions which are not really in the political air right now,but perhaps with the change of administration would be -- use markets. 
 Markets are a very strong force.,For example, rather than trying to regulate away problems,,which probably won't work, if we could price,into the cost of doing business, the cost of catastrophe,,so that people who are doing things that had a higher cost of catastrophe,would have to take insurance against that risk.,So if you wanted to put a drug on the market you could put it on.,But it wouldn't have to be approved by regulators;,you'd have to convince an actuary that it would be safe.,And if you apply the notion of insurance more broadly,,you can use a more powerful force, a market force,,to provide feedback.,How could you keep the law?,I think the law would be a really good thing to keep.,Well, you have to hold people accountable.,The law requires accountability.,Today scientists, technologists, businessmen, engineers,don't have any personal responsibility,for the consequences of their actions.,So if you tie that -- you have to tie that back with the law. 
 And finally, I think we have to do something that's not really --,it's almost unacceptable to say this -- which,,we have to begin to design the future.,We can't pick the future, but we can steer the future.,Our investment in trying to prevent pandemic flu,is affecting the distribution of possible outcomes.,We may not be able to stop it, but the likelihood,that it will get past us is lower if we focus on that problem.,So we can design the future if we choose what kind of things,we want to have happen and not have happen,,and steer us to a lower-risk place.,Vice President Gore will talk about how we could steer the climate trajectory,into a lower probability of catastrophic risk. 
 But above all, what we have to do is we have to help the good guys,,the people on the defensive side,,have an advantage over the people who want to abuse things.,And what we have to do to do that,is we have to limit access to certain information.,And growing up as we have, and holding very high,the value of free speech, this is a hard thing for us to accept --,for all of us to accept.,It's especially hard for the scientists to accept who still remember,,you know, Galileo essentially locked up,,and who are still fighting this battle against the church.,But that's the price of having a civilization.,The price of retaining the rule of law,is to limit the access to the great and kind of unbridled power.,Thank you.,(Applause)It's wonderful to be back.,I love this wonderful gathering.,And you must be wondering, "What on earth?,Have they put up the wrong slide?",No, no.,Look at this magnificent beast,,and ask the question: Who designed it? 
 This is TED; this isnTechnology, Entertainment, Design,,and there's a dairy cow.,It's a quite wonderfully designed animal.,And I was thinking,nhow do I introduce this?,And I thought, well, maybenthat old doggerel by Joyce Kilmer,,you know: "Poems are made by foolsnlike me, but only God can make a tree.",And you might say,n"Well, God designed the cow." 
 But, of course, God got a lot of help.,This is the ancestor of cattle.,This is the aurochs.,And it was designed by natural selection,,the process of natural selection,nover many millions of years.,And then it became domesticated,nthousands of years ago.,And human beings became its stewards,,and, without even knowingnwhat they were doing,,they gradually redesigned itnand redesigned it and redesigned it.,And then more recently, they really begannto do reverse engineering on this beast,and figure out just whatnthe parts were, how they worked,and how they might be optimized --nhow they might be made better. 
 Now, why am I talking about cows?,Because I want to say thatnmuch the same thing is true of religions.,Religions are natural phenomena --nthey're just as natural as cows.,They have evolved over millennia.,They have a biological base,njust like the aurochs.,They have become domesticated,,and human beings have been redesigningntheir religions for thousands of years.,This is TED, and I wantnto talk about design.,Because what I've been doingnfor the last four years --,really since the first time you saw me --,some of you saw me at TEDnwhen I was talking about religion --,and in the last four years,,I've been workingnjust about non-stop on this topic.,And you might say it's aboutnthe reverse engineering of religions.,Now that very idea, I think,nstrikes terror in many people,,or anger, or anxietynof one sort or another.,And that is the spellnthat I want to break. 
 I want to say, no, religionsnare an important natural phenomenon.,We should study themnwith the same intensity,that we study all the othernimportant natural phenomena,,like global warming, as we heardnso eloquently last night from Al Gore.,Today's religions are brilliantlyndesigned -- brilliantly designed.,They are immensely powerfulnsocial institutions,and many of their featuresncan be traced back to earlier features,that we can really make sense ofnby reverse engineering.,And, as with the cow, there's a mixturenof evolutionary design --,designed by natural selection itself --,and intelligent design --,more or less intelligent design --,and redesigned by human beings,who are tryingnto redesign their religions. 
 You don't do book talks at TED,,but I'm going to havenjust one slide about my book,,because there is one message in it,which I think this groupnreally needs to hear.,And I would be very interestednto get your responses to this.,It's the one policy proposalnthat I make in the book,,at this time, when I claimnnot to know enough about religion,to know what othernpolicy proposals to make.,And it's one that echoes remarksnthat you've heard already today. 
 Here's my proposal,,I'm going to just take a couplenof minutes to explain it:,Education on world religionsnfor all of our children --,in primary school, in high school,,in public schools, in private schoolsnand in home schooling.,So what I'm proposing is,,just as we require reading, writing,narithmetic, American history,,so we should have a curriculum on factsnabout all the religions of the world --,about their history,nabout their creeds, about their texts,,their music, their symbolisms,ntheir prohibitions, their requirements.,And this should be presentednfactually, straightforwardly,,with no particular spin,nto all of the children in the country.,And as long as you teach them that,,you can teach them anything else you like.,That, I think, is maximal tolerancenfor religious freedom.,As long as you inform your childrennabout other religions,,then you may -- and as early as you likenand whatever you like --,teach them whatever creednyou want them to learn.,But also let them knownabout other religions. 
 Now, why do I say that?,Because democracy dependsnon an informed citizenship.,Informed consent is the very bedrocknof our understanding of democracy.,Misinformed consent is not worth it.,It's like a coin flip;nit doesn't count, really.,Democracy depends on informed consent.,This is the way we treat peoplenas responsible adults.,Now, children below the age of consentnare a special case.,Parents -- I'm going to use a wordnthat Pastor Rick just used --,parents are stewards of their children.,They don't own them.,You can't own your children.,You have a responsibility to the world,,to the state, to them,nto take care of them right.,You may teach them whatever creednyou think is most important,,but I say you have a responsibilitynto let them be informed,about all the other creedsnin the world, too. 
 The reason I've taken this timenis I've been fascinated to hear,some of the reactions to this.,One reviewer for a Roman Catholicnnewspaper called it "totalitarian.",It strikes me as practically libertarian.,Is it totalitarian to requirenreading, writing and arithmetic?,I don't think so.,All I'm saying is --,and facts, facts only;nno values, just facts --,about all the world's religions.,Another reviewer called it "hilarious.",Well, I'm really bothered by the fact,that anybody would thinknthat was hilarious.,It seems to me to be such a plausible,,natural extension of the democraticnprinciples we already have,that I'm shocked to think anybodynwould find that just ridiculous.,I know many religions,are so anxious about preserving the puritynof their faith among their children,that they are intent on keepingntheir children ignorant of other faiths.,I don't think that's defensible.,But I'd really be pleasednto get your answers on that --,any reactions to that -- later. 
 But now I'm going to move on.,Back to the cow.,This picture, which I pullednoff the web --,the fellow on the left is reallynan important part of this picture.,That's the steward.,Cows couldn't live without humannstewards -- they're domesticated.,They're a sort of ectosymbiont.,They depend on us for their survival.,And Pastor Ricknwas just talking about sheep.,I'm going to talk about sheep, too.,There's a lot of serendipitousnconvergence here.,How clever it was of sheepnto acquire shepherds! 
 (Laughter) 
 Think of what this got them.,They could outsource all their problems:,protection from predators,nfood-finding ... 
 (Laughter) 
 ... health maintenance. 
 (Laughter) 
 The only cost in most flocks --nnot even this -- a loss of free mating.,What a deal!,"How clever of sheep!" you might say.,Except, of course,nit wasn't the sheep's cleverness.,We all know sheep are not exactly rocketnscientists -- they're not very smart.,It wasn't the clevernessnof the sheep at all.,They were clueless.,But it was a very clever move.,Whose clever move was it?,It was the clever movenof natural selection itself. 
 Francis Crick, the co-discoverernof the structure of DNA,with Jim Watson,,once joked about what he callednOrgel's Second Rule.,Leslie Orgel is a molecularnbiologist, brilliant guy,,and Orgel's Second Rule is:,Evolution is cleverer than you are.,Now, that is not Intelligent Design --nnot from Francis Crick.,Evolution is cleverer than you are.,If you understand Orgel's Second Rule,nthen you understand,why the Intelligent Design movementnis basically a hoax. 
 The designs discoverednby the process of natural selection,are brilliant, unbelievably brilliant.,Again and again biologists are fascinatednwith the brilliance of what's discovered.,But the process itself is without purpose,,without foresight, without design.,When I was here four years ago,,I told the story about an antnclimbing a blade of grass.,And why the ant was doing itnwas because its brain had been infected,with a lancet fluke that was needednto get into the belly of a sheep or a cow,in order to reproduce.,So it was sort of a spooky story. 
 And I think some peoplenmay have misunderstood.,Lancet flukes aren't smart.,I submit that the intelligencenof a lancet fluke is down there,,somewhere between petunia and carrot.,They're not really bright.nThey don't have to be.,The lesson we learn from this is:,you don't have to have a mindnto be a beneficiary.,The design is there in nature,nbut it's not in anybody's head.,It doesn't have to be.,That's the way evolution works.,Question: Was domesticationngood for sheep?,It was great for their genetic fitness. 
 And here I want to remind younof a wonderful point,that Paul MacCready madenat TED three years ago.,Here's what he said:,"Ten thousand years ago,nat the dawn of agriculture,,human population, plus livestock and pets,,was approximately a tenth of one percentnof the terrestrial vertebrate landmass.",That was just 10,000 years ago.,Yesterday, in biological terms.,What is it today? Does anybodynremember what he told us?,98 percent.,That is what we have done on this planet. 
 Now, I talked to Paul afterwards --nI wanted to check to find out,how he'd calculated this, and getnthe sources and so forth --,and he also gave me a papernthat he had written on this.,And there was a passage in itnwhich he did not present here,and I think it is so good,nI'm going to read it to you:,"Over billions of yearsnon a unique sphere,,chance has paintedna thin covering of life:,complex, improbable,nwonderful and fragile.,Suddenly, we humans --na recently arrived species,no longer subject to the checksnand balances inherent in nature --,have grown in population,ntechnology and intelligence,to a position of terrible power.,We now wield the paintbrush.",We heard about the atmospherenas a thin layer of varnish.,Life itself is just a thin coatnof paint on this planet.,And we're the onesnthat hold the paintbrush.,And how can we do that? 
 The key to our dominationnof the planet is culture.,And the key to culture is religion.,Suppose Martian scientists came to Earth.,They would be puzzled by many things.,Anybody know what this is?nI'll tell you what it is.,This is a million people gatheringnon the banks of the Ganges in 2001,,perhaps the largest single gatheringnof human beings ever,,as seen from satellite photograph.,Here's a big crowd.,Here's another crowd in Mecca.,Martians would be amazed by this.,They'd want to know how it originated,,what it was fornand how it perpetuates itself. 
 Actually, I'm going to pass over this.,The ant isn't alone.,There's all sorts of wonderful casesnof species which -- in that case --,A parasite gets into a mousenand needs to get into the belly of a cat.,And it turns the mouseninto Mighty Mouse, makes it fearless,,so it runs out in the open,nwhere it'll be eaten by a cat.,True story.,In other words, we have these hijackers --,you've seen this slide before,nfrom four years ago --,a parasite that infects the brainnand induces even suicidal behavior,,on behalf of a causenother than one's own genetic fitness. 
 Does that ever happen to us?,Yes, it does -- quite wonderfully.,The Arabic word "Islam"nmeans "submission.",It means "surrender of self-interestnto the will of Allah.",But I'm not just talking about Islam.,I'm talking also about Christianity.,This is a parchment music pagenthat I found in a Paris bookstall,50 years ago.,And on it, it says, in Latin:,"Semen est verbum Dei.nSator autem Christus.",The word of God is the seednand the sower of the seed is Christ.,Same idea. Well, not quite.,But in fact, Christians, too ...,glory in the factnthat they have surrendered to God.,I'll give you a few quotes.,"The heart of worship is surrender.,Surrendered people obey God's words,neven if it doesn't make sense.",Those words are by Rick Warren.,Those are from "The Purpose Driven Life." 
 And I want to turn now, briefly,nto talk about that book, which I've read.,You've all got a copy,,and you've just heard the man.,And what I want to do nownis say a bit about this book,from the design standpoint,,because I think it's actuallyna brilliant book.,First of all, the goal -- and younheard just now what the goal is --,it's to bring purpose to the livesnof millions, and he has succeeded.,Is it a good goal? In itself, I'm surenwe all agree, it is a wonderful goal.,He's absolutely right.,There are lots of people out therenwho don't have purpose in their life,,and bringing purpose to their lifenis a wonderful goal.,I give him an A+ on this. 
 (Laughter) 
 Is the goal achieved?,Yes.,Thirty million copies of this book.,Al Gore, eat your heart out. 
 (Laughter) 
 Just exactly what Al is tryingnto do, Rick is doing.,This is a fantastic achievement.,And the means -- how does he do it? 
 It's a brilliant redesignnof traditional religious themes --,updating them, quietly droppingnobsolete features,,putting new interpretationsnon other features.,This is the evolution of religion that'snbeen going on for thousands of years,,and he's just the latestnbrilliant practitioner of it.,I don't have to tell you this;nyou just heard the man.,Excellent insights into human psychology,nwise advice on every page.,Moreover, he invites usnto look under the hood.,I really appreciated that.,For instance, he has an appendixnwhere he explains,his choice of translationsnof different Bible verses.,The book is clear, vivid, accessible,nbeautifully formatted.,Just enough repetition.,That's really important.,Every time you read it or say it,nyou make another copy in your brain.,Every time you read it or say it,nyou make another copy in your brain. 
 (Laughter) 
 With me, everybody -- 
 (Audience and Dan Dennett)nEvery time you read it or say it,,you make another copy in your brain. 
 Thank you. 
 And now we come to my problem.,Because I'm absolutely sincerenin my appreciation,of all that I said about this book.,But I wish it were better.,I have some problems with the book.,And it would just be insincere of mennot to address those problems.,I wish he could do this with a revision,,a Mark 2 version of his book.,"The truth will set you free.",That's what it says in the Bible,,and it's somethingnthat I want to live by, too. 
 My problem is, some of the bits in itnI don't think are true.,Now some of thisnis a difference of opinion.,And that's not my main complaint,nthat's worth mentioning.,Here's a passage -- it's very muchnwhat he said, anyway:,"If there was no Godnwe would all be accidents,,the result of astronomicalnrandom chance in the Universe.,You could stop reading this booknbecause life would have no purpose,or meaning or significance.,There would be no right or wrong,and no hope beyondnyour brief years on Earth.",Now, I just do not believe that.,By the way, I find -- Homer Groening'snfilm presented a beautiful alternative,to that very claim.,Yes, there is meaning and a reasonnfor right or wrong.,We don't need a belief in Godnto be good or to have meaning in us.,But that, as I said,nis just a difference of opinion.,That's not what I'm really worried about. 
 How about this: "God designednthis planet's environment,just so we could live in it.",I'm afraid that a lot of peoplentake that sentiment to mean,that we don't have to donthe sorts of things,that Al Gore is trying so hardnto get us to do.,I am not happy with that sentiment at all.,And then I find this: "All the evidencenavailable in the biological sciences,supports the core proposition thatnthe cosmos is a specially designed whole,with life and mankindnas its fundamental goal and purpose,,a whole in which all facetsnof reality have their meaning,and explanation in this central fact.",Well, that's Michael Denton.nHe's a creationist.,And here, I think, "Wait a minute."nI read this again.,I read it three or four times and I think,,"Is he really endorsingnIntelligent Design?,Is he endorsing creationism here?",And you can't tell.,So I'm sort of thinking,n"Well, I don't know,,I don't know if I wantnto get upset with this yet." 
 But then I read on, and I read this:n"First, Noah had never seen rain,,because prior to the Flood, God irrigatednthe earth from the ground up.",I wish that sentence weren't in there,nbecause I think it is false.,And I think that thinking this waynabout the history of the planet,,after we've just been hearingnabout the history of the planet,over millions of years,,discourages peoplenfrom scientific understanding.,Now, Rick Warren uses scientific terms,and scientific factoids and informationnin a very interesting way. 
 Here's one: "God deliberately shapednand formed you to serve him,in a way that makes your ministry unique.,He carefully mixed the DNA cocktailnthat created you.",I think that's false.,Now, maybe we want to treat itnas metaphorical.,Here's another one: "For instance,nyour brain can store 100 trillion facts.,Your mind can handlen15,000 decisions a second.",Well, it would be interestingnto find the interpretation,where I would accept that.,There might be some waynof treating that as true.,"Anthropologists have notednthat worship is a universal urge,,hardwired by God intonthe very fiber of our being --,an inbuilt need to connect with God.",Well, the sense of which I agree with him,,except I think it hasnan evolutionary explanation. 
 And what I findndeeply troubling in this book,is that he seems to be arguingnthat if you want to be moral,,if you want to have meaning in your life,,you have to be an Intelligent Designer,,you have to deny the theory of evolutionnby natural selection.,And I think, on the contrary,,that it is very importantnto solving the world's problems,that we take evolutionarynbiology seriously.,Whose truth are we going to listen to?,Well, this is fromn"The Purpose Driven Life":,"The Bible must becomenthe authoritative standard for my life:,the compass I rely on for direction,,the counsel I listen tonfor making wise decisions,,and the benchmark I usenfor evaluating everything.",Well maybe, OK, but what's goingnto follow from this? 
 And here's one that does concern me.,Remember I quoted himnbefore with this line:,"Surrendered people obey God's word,neven if it doesn't make sense.",And that's a problem. 
 (Sighs) 
 "Don't ever argue with the Devil.,He's better at arguing than you are,,having had thousandsnof years to practice.",Now, Rick Warrenndidn't invent this clever move.,It's an old move.,It's a very clevernadaptation of religions.,It's a wild card for disarmingnany reasonable criticism.,"You don't like my interpretation?,You've got a reasonable objection to it?,Don't listen, don't listen!,That's the Devil speaking.",This discourages the sortnof reasoning citizenship,it seems to me that we want to have. 
 I've got one more problem,nthen I'm through.,And I'd really like to getna response if Rick is able to do it.,"In the Great Commission, Jesus said,,'Go to all people of all nationsnand make them my disciples.,Baptize them in the name of the Father,nthe Son and the Holy Spirit,,and teach them to doneverything I've told you.'",The Bible says Jesus is the only onenwho can save the world.,We've seen many wonderful mapsnof the world in the last day or so.,Here's one, not as beautifulnas the others;,it simply showsnthe religions of the world.,Here's one that shows the sort of currentnbreakdown of the different religions. 
 Do we really want to commit ourselves,to engulfing all the other religions,,when their holy books are telling them,,"Don't listen to the other side,nthat's just Satan talking!"?,It seems to me thatnthat's a very problematic ship,to get on for the future.,I found this sign as I was drivingnto Maine recently,,in front of a church:n"Good without God becomes zero.",Sort of cute.,A very clever little meme.,I don't believe it and I think this idea,npopular as it is --,not in this guise, but in general --,is itself one of the mainnproblems that we face. 
 If you are like me, you knownmany wonderful, committed, engaged,atheists, agnostics, who are beingnvery good without God.,And you also know many religious peoplenwho hide behind their sanctity,instead of doing good works.,So, I wish we could drop this meme.,I wish this meme would go extinct. 
 Thanks very much for your attention. 
 (Applause)I grew up in Northern Ireland, right up in the,very, very north end of it there,,where it's absolutely freezing cold.,This was me running around in the back garden mid-summer. 
 (Laughter) 
 I couldn't pick a career.,In Ireland the obvious choice is the military,,but to be honest it actually kind of sucks. 
 (Laughter) 
 My mother wanted me to be a dentist.,But the problem was that people kept blowing everything up.,So I actually went to school in Belfast,,which was where all the action happened.,And this was a pretty common sight.,The school I went to was pretty boring.,They forced us to learn things like Latin.,The school teachers weren't having much fun,,the sports were very dirty or very painful.,So I cleverly chose rowing, which I got very good at. 
 And I was actually rowing for my school here,until this fateful day, and I flipped over right in front,of the entire school.,And that was the finishing post right there. 
 (Laughter) 
 So this was extremely embarrassing.,But our school at that time got a grant from the government,,and they got an incredible computer -- the research machine 3DZ --,and they left the programming manuals lying around.,And so students like myself with nothing to do,,we would learn how to program it.,Also around this time, at home,,this was the computer that people were buying.,It was called the Sinclair ZX80. This was a 1K computer,,and you'd buy your programs on cassette tape. 
 Actually I'm just going to pause for one second,,because I heard that there's a prerequisite to speak here at TED --,you had to have a picture of yourself from the old days with big hair.,So I brought a picture with big hair. 
 (Laughter). 
 I just want to get that out of the way.,So after the Sinclair ZX80 came along the very cleverly named,Sinclair ZX81. 
 (Laughter) 
 And -- you see the picture at the bottom?,There's a picture of a guy doing homework with his son.,That's what they thought they had built it for.,The reality is we got the programming manual,and we started making games for it.,We were programming in BASIC,,which is a pretty awful language for games,,so we ended up learning Assembly language,so we could really take control of the hardware.,This is the guy that invented it, Sir Clive Sinclair,,and he's showing his machine.,You had this same thing in America,,it was called the Timex Sinclair1000. 
 To play a game in those days you had to have an imagination,to believe that you were really playing "Battlestar Galactica.",The graphics were just horrible.,You had to have an even better imagination to play this game,,"Death Rider.",But of course the scientists couldn't help themselves.,They started making their own video games.,This is one of my favorite ones here, where they have rabbit breeding,,so males choose the lucky rabbit. 
 It was around this time we went from 1K to 16K,,which was quite the leap.,And if you're wondering how much 16K is,,this eBay logo here is 16K.,And in that amount of memory someone programmed,a full flight simulation program.,And that's what it looked like.,I spent ages flying this flight simulator,,and I honestly believed I could fly airplanes by the end of it. 
 Here's Clive Sinclair now launching his color computer.,He's recognized as being the father of video games in Europe.,He's a multi-millionaire, and I think that's why he's,smiling in this photograph. 
 So I went on for the next 20 years or so,making a lot of different games.,Some of the highlights were things like "The Terminator,","Aladdin," the "Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles.",Because I was from the United Kingdom,,they thought the word ninja was a little too mean for children,,so they decided to call it hero instead.,I personally preferred the Spanish version,,which was "Tortugas Ninja.",That was much better. 
 (Laughter) 
 Then the last game I did was based on trying to get the video game industry,and Hollywood to actually work together on something --,instead of licensing from each other, to actually work. 
 Now, Chris did ask me to bring some statistics with me,,so I've done that.,The video game industry in 2005 became a 29 billion dollar business.,It grows every year.,Last year was the biggest year.,By 2008, we're going to kick the butt of the music industry.,By 2010, we're going to hit 42 billion.,43 percent of gamers are female.,So there's a lot more female gamers than people are really aware. 
 The average age of gamers?,Well, obviously it's for children, right?,Well, no, actually it's 30 years old.,And interestingly, the people who buy the most games are 37.,So 37 is our target audience.,All video games are violent.,Of course the newspapers love to beat on this.,But 83 percent of games don't have any mature content whatsoever,,so it's just not true. 
 Online gaming statistics.,I brought some stuff on "World of Warcraft." It's 5.5 million players.,It makes about 80 million bucks a month in subscriptions.,It costs 50 bucks just to install it on your computer,,making the publisher about another 275 million.,The game costs about 80 million dollars to make,,so basically it pays for itself in about a month.,A player in a game called "Project Entropia",actually bought his own island for 26,500 dollars.,You have to remember that this is not a real island.,He didn't actually buy anything, just some data.,But he got great terms on it.,This purchase included mining and hunting rights,,ownership of all land on the island, and a castle,with no furniture included. 
 (Laughter) 
 This market is now estimated at over 800 million dollars annually.,And what's interesting about it is the market was actually created,by the gamers themselves.,They found clever ways to trade items,and to sell their accounts to each other,so that they could make money while they were playing their games.,I dove onto eBay a couple of days ago,just to see what was gong on, typed in World of Warcraft, got 6,000 items.,I liked this one the best:,a level 60 Warlock with lots of epics for 174,000 dollars.,It's like that guy obviously had some pain while making it. 
 So as far as popularity of games,,what do you think these people are doing here?,It turns out they're actually in Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles,listening to the L.A. Philharmonic playing video game music.,That's what the show looks like.,You would expect it to be cheesy, but it's not.,It's very, very epic and a very beautiful concert.,And the people that went there absolutely loved it. 
 What do you think these people are doing?,They're actually bringing their computers so they can play games,against each other.,And this is happening in every city around the world.,This is happening in your local cities too,,you're probably just not aware of it. 
 Now, Chris told me that you had a timeline video a few years ago,here just to show how video game graphics have been improving.,I wanted to update that video and give you a new look at it.,But what I want you to do is to try to understand it.,We're on this curve, and the graphics are getting,so ridiculously better.,And I'm going to show you up to maybe 2007.,But I want you to try and think about what games could look like,10 years from now.,So we're going to start that video. 
 Video: Throughout human history people have played games.,As man's intellect and technology have evolved,so too have the games he plays. 
 (Music) 
 (Applause) 
 David Perry: The thing again I want you to think about is,,don't look at these graphics and think of that's the way it is.,Think about that's where we are right now,,and the curve that we're on means that this is going to continue,to get better.,This is an example of the kind of graphics you need to be able to draw,if you wanted to get a job in the video game industry today.,You need to be really an incredible artist.,And once we get enough of those guys, we're going to want,more fantasy artists that can create places,we've never been to before, or characters that,we've just never seen before. 
 So the obvious thing for me to talk about today is graphics and audio.,But if you were to go to a game developers conference,,what they're all talking about is emotion, purpose,,meaning, understanding and feeling.,You'll hear about talks like, can a video game make you cry?,And these are the kind of topics we really actually care about. 
 I came across a student who's absolutely excellent,at expressing himself, and this student agreed,that he would not show his video to anybody until,you here at TED had seen it.,So I'd like to play this video.,So this is a student's opinion on what his experience of games are. 
 Video: I, like many of you, live somewhere between,reality and video games.,Some part of me -- a true living, breathing person --,has become programmed, electronic and virtual.,The boundary of my brain that divides real from fantasy,has finally begun to crumble.,I'm a video game addict and this is my story. 
 (Music) 
 In the year of my birth,the Nintendo Entertainment System also went into development.,I played in the backyard, learned to read,,and even ate some of my vegetables.,Most of my childhood was spent playing with Legos.,But as was the case for most of my generation,,I spent a lot of time in front of the TV.,Mr. Rogers, Walt Disney, Nick Junior,,and roughly half a million commercials have undoubtedly,left their mark on me. 
 When my parents bought my sister and I our first Nintendo,,whatever inherent addictive quality this early interactive,electronic entertainment possessed quickly took hold of me.,At some point something clicked. 
 (Music) 
 With the combination of simple, interactive stories,and the warmth of the TV set, my simple 16-bit Nintendo,became more than just an escape.,It became an alternate existence, my virtual reality. 
 (Music) 
 I'm a video game addict, and it's not because of,a certain number of hours I have spent playing,,or nights I have gone without sleep to finish the next level.,It is because I have had life-altering experiences in virtual space,,and video games had begun to erode my own understanding,of what is real and what is not.,I'm addicted, because even though I know I'm losing my grip on reality,,I still crave more. 
 (Music) 
 From an early age I learned to invest myself emotionally,in what unfolded before me on screen.,Today, after 20 years of watching TV geared to make me emotional,,even a decent insurance commercial can bring tears to my eyes.,I am just one of a new generation that is growing up.,A generation who may experience much more meaning,through video games than they will through the real world.,Video games are nearing an evolutionary leap,,a point where game worlds will look and feel just as real,as the films we see in theatres, or the news we watch on TV.,And while my sense of free will in these virtual worlds,may still be limited, what I do learn applies to my real life.,Play enough video games and eventually you will,really believe you can snowboard, fly a plane,,drive a nine-second quarter mile, or kill a man.,I know I can. 
 Unlike any pop culture phenomenon before it,,video games actually allow us to become part of the machine.,They allow us to sublimate into the culture of interactive,,downloaded, streaming, HD reality.,We are interacting with our entertainment.,I have come to expect this level of interaction.,Without it, the problems faced in the real world --,poverty, war, disease and genocide -- lack the levity they should.,Their importance blends into the sensationalized drama,of prime time TV. 
 But the beauty of video games today lies not in the lifelike graphics,,the vibrating joysticks or virtual surround sound.,It lies in that these games are beginning to make me emotional.,I have fought in wars, feared for my own survival,,watched my cohorts die on beaches and woods that look and feel,more real than any textbook or any news story. 
 The people who create these games are smart.,They know what makes me scared, excited, panicked, proud or sad.,Then they use these emotions to dimensionalize the worlds they create.,A well-designed video game will seamlessly,weave the user into the fabric of the virtual experience.,As one becomes more experienced,the awareness of physical control melts away.,I know what I want and I do it.,No buttons to push, no triggers to pull, just me and the game.,My fate and the fate of the world around me lie inside my hands.,I know violent video games make my mother worry.,What troubles me is not that video game violence,is becoming more and more like real life violence,,but that real life violence is starting to look more and more,like a video game. 
 (Music) 
 These are all troubles outside of myself.,I, however, have a problem very close to home.,Something has happened to my brain. 
 (Music) 
 Perhaps there is a single part of our brain that holds,all of our gut instincts, the things we know to do,before we even think.,While some of these instincts may be innate, most are learned,,and all of them are hardwired into our brains.,These instincts are essential for survival in both real and virtual worlds.,Only in recent years has the technology behind video games,allowed for a true overlap in stimuli.,As gamers we are now living by the same laws of physics,in the same cities and doing many of the same things,we once did in real life, only virtually.,Consider this --,my real life car has about 25,000 miles on it.,In all my driving games, I've driven a total of 31,459 miles.,To some degree I've learned how to drive from the game.,The sensory cues are very similar.,It's a funny feeling when you have spent more time,doing something on the TV than you have in real life.,When I am driving down a road at sunset all I can think is,,this is almost as beautiful as my games are. 
 For my virtual worlds are perfect.,More beautiful and rich than the real world around us.,I'm not sure what the implications of my experience are,,but the potential for using realistic video game stimuli in repetition,on a vast number of loyal participants is frightening to me.,Today I believe Big Brother would find much more success,brainwashing the masses with video games,rather than just simply TVs.,Video games are fun, engaging, and leave your brain,completely vulnerable to re-programming.,But maybe brainwashing isn't always bad. 
 Imagine a game that teaches us to respect each other,,or helps us to understand the problems we're all facing,in the real world.,There is a potential to do good as well.,It is critical, as these virtual worlds continue to mirror,the real world we live in, that game developers realize,that they have tremendous responsibilities before them.,I'm not sure what the future of video games holds,for our civilization.,But as virtual and real world experiences increasingly overlap,there is a greater and greater potential for other people,to feel the same way I do. 
 What I have only recently come to realize,is that beyond the graphics, sound, game play and emotion,it is the power to break down reality that is so fascinating,and addictive to me.,I know that I am losing my grip.,Part of me is just waiting to let go.,I know though, that no matter how amazing video games may become,,or how flat the real world may seem to us,,that we must stay aware of what our games are teaching us,and how they leave us feeling when we finally do unplug. 
 (Applause) 
 DP: Wow. 
 (Applause) 
 I found that video very, very thought provoking,,and that's why I wanted to bring it here for you guys to see.,And what was interesting about it is the obvious choice,for me to talk about was graphics and audio.,But as you heard, Michael talked about all these other elements as well.,Video games give an awful lot of other things too,,and that's why people get so addicted.,The most important one being fun. 
 The name of this track is "The Magic To Come.",Who is that going to come from?,Is it going to come from the best directors in the world,as we thought it probably would?,I don't think so.,I think it's going to come from the children who are growing up now,that aren't stuck with all of the stuff that we remember from the past.,They're going to do it their way, using the tools that we've created.,The same with students or highly creative people,,writers and people like that. 
 As far as colleges go, there's about 350 colleges around the world,teaching video game courses.,That means there's literally thousands of new ideas.,Some of the ideas are really dreadful and some of them are great.,There's nothing worse than having to listen to someone,try and pitch you a really bad video game idea. 
 (Laughter) 
 Chris Anderson: You're off, you're off. That's it.,He's out of time. 
 DP: I've just got a little tiny bit more if you'll indulge me. 
 CA: Go ahead. I'm going to stay right here though. 
 (Laughter) 
 DP: This is just a cool shot, because this is students coming to school after class.,The school is closed; they're coming back at midnight,because they want to pitch their video game ideas.,I'm sitting at the front of the class,,and they're actually pitching their ideas.,So it's hard to get students to come back to class,,but it is possible. 
 This is my daughter, her name's Emma, she's 17 months old.,And I've been asking myself, what is Emma going to experience,in the video game world?,And as I've shown here, we have the audience.,She's never going to know a world where you can't press a button,and have millions of people ready to play.,You know, we have the technology.,She's never going to know a world where the graphics just aren't,stunning and really immersive.,And as the student video showed, we can impact and move.,She's never going to know a world where video games,aren't incredibly emotional and will probably make her cry.,I just hope she likes video games. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, my closing thought.,Games on the surface seem simple entertainment,,but for those that like to look a little deeper,,the new paradigm of video games could open entirely new frontiers,to creative minds that like to think big.,Where better to challenge those minds than here at TED? 
 Thank you. 
 Chris Anderson: David Perry. That was awesome.Stephanie White: I'm going to let her introduce herself to everybody.,Can you tell everybody your name? 
 Einstein: Einstein. 
 SW: This is Einstein. Can you tell everyone "hi"? 
 E: Hello. 
 SW: That's nice. Can you be polite? 
 E: Hi, sweetheart. 
 SW: Much better. Well, Einstein is very honored to be here at TED 2006,,amongst all you modern-day Einsteins. In fact, she's very excited. 
 E: Woo. 
 SW: Yeah.,(Laughter),Since we've arrived, there's been a constant buzz about,all the exciting speakers here for the conference.,This morning we've heard a lot of whispers about,Tom Reilly's wrap-up on Saturday. Einstein, did you hear whispers? 
 E: [Squawks] 
 SW: Yeah.,(Laughter),Einstein's especially interested in Penelope's talk.,A lot of her research goes on in caves, which can get pretty dusty. 
 E: Achoo! 
 SW: It could make her sneeze. But more importantly, her research,could help Einstein find a cure for her never-ending scratchy throat. 
 Einstein: [Coughs] 
 SW: Yeah.,(Laughter),Well, Bob Russell was telling us about his work on nanotubes,in his research at the microscopic level.,Well, that's really cool, but what Einstein's really hoping,is that maybe he'll genetically engineer a five-pound peanut. 
 E: Oh, my God! My God! My God! 
 SW: Yeah. She would get really, really excited.,(Laughter),That is one big peanut. Since Einstein is a bird,,she's very interested in things that fly.,She thinks Burt Rutan is very impressive. 
 E: Ooh. 
 SW: Yeah. She especially likes his latest achievement, SpaceShipOne. 
 Einstein, would you like to ride in Burt's spaceship?,E: [Spaceship noise],SW: Even if it doesn't have a laser? 
 E: [Laser noise],(Laughter) 
 SW: Yeah, yeah. That was pretty funny, Einstein.,Now, Einstein also thinks, you know, working in caves,and travelling through space -- it's all very dangerous jobs.,It would be very dangerous if you fell down. 
 E: Wheeeeeee! [Splat] 
 SW: Yeah.,(Laughter),Little splat at the end there. Einstein, did that hurt? 
 E: Ow, ow, ow. 
 SW: Yeah. It's all a lot of hard work. 
 E: [Squawks] 
 SW: Yeah. It can get a bird like Einstein frustrated. 
 E: [Squawks] 
 SW: Yeah, it sure can. But when Einstein needs to relax from her job,educating the public, she loves to take in the arts.,If the children of the Uganda need another dance partner,,Einstein could sure fit the bill, because she loves to dance.,Can you get down?,E: [Bobbing head] (Laughter),SW: Let's get down for everybody. Come on now.,She's going to make me do it, too. Ooh, ooh. 
 Einstein: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. 
 SW: Do your head now. 
 E: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.,(Laughter) 
 SW: Or maybe Sirena Huang would like to learn some arias,on her violin, and Einstein can sing along with some opera? 
 E: [Operatic squawk] 
 SW: Very good.,(Laughter),Or maybe Stu just needs another backup singer?,Einstein, can you also sing?,I know, you need to get rid of that seed first. Can you sing? 
 E: La, la. 
 SW: There you go. And, of course, if all else fails,,you can just run off and enjoy a fun fiesta. 
 E: [Squawks] 
 SW: All right. Well, Einstein was pretty embarrassed to admit this earlier,,but she was telling me backstage that she had a problem. 
 E: What's the matter? 
 SW: No, I don't have a problem. You have the problem, remember?,You were saying that you were really embarrassed,,because you're in love with a pirate? 
 E: Yar. 
 SW: There you go. And what do pirates like to drink? 
 E: Beer.,SW: Yeah, that's right. But you don't like to drink beer, Einstein.,You like to drink water. 
 E: [Water sound] 
 SW: Very good. Now, really, she is pretty nervous.,Because one of her favorite folks from back home is here,,and she's pretty nervous to meet him.,She thinks Al Gore is a really good-looking man.,What do you say to a good-looking man? 
 E: Hey, baby.,(Laughter) 
 SW: And so do all the folks back home in Tennessee. 
 E: Yee haw.,(Laughter) 
 SW: And since she's such a big fan,,she knows that his birthday is coming up at the end of March.,And we didn't think he'd be in town then,,so Einstein wanted to do something special for him.,So let's see if Einstein will sing "Happy Birthday" to Al Gore.,Can you sing "Happy Birthday" to him? 
 E: Happy birthday to you. 
 SW: Again. 
 E: Happy birthday to you. 
 SW: Again. 
 E: Happy birthday to you. 
 SW: Big finish. 
 E: Happy birthday to you. 
 SW: Good job!,(Applause),Well, before we wrap it up, she would like to give a shout out,to all our animal friends back at the Knoxville Zoo.,Einstein, do you want to say "hi" to all the owls? 
 E: Woo, woo, woo. 
 SW: What about the other birds? 
 E: Tweet, tweet, tweet. 
 SW: And the penguin? 
 E: Quack, quack, quack.,SW: There we go.,(Laughter),Let's get that one out of there. How about a chimpanzee? 
 E: Ooh, ooh, ooh. Aah, aah, aah. 
 SW: Very good.,(Laughter),What about a wolf? 
 E: Ooooowww. 
 SW: And a pig? 
 E: Oink, oink, oink. 
 SW: And the rooster? 
 E: Cock-a-doodle-doo! 
 SW: And how about those cats? 
 E: Meow.,(Laughter) 
 SW: At the zoo we have big cats from the jungle. 
 E: Grrrrr.,(Laughter) 
 SW: What about a skunk? 
 E: Stinker.,(Laughter) 
 SW: She's a comedian. I suppose you think you're famous? Are you famous? 
 E: Superstar. 
 SW: Yeah. You are a superstar.,(Laughter),Well, we would like to encourage all of you to do your part,to help protect Einstein's animal friends, and to do your part,to help protect their homes that they live [in].,Now, Einstein does say it best when we ask her.,Why do we want to protect your home? 
 E: I'm special. 
 SW: You are very special. What would you like to say,to all these nice people? 
 E: I love you. 
 SW: That's good. Can you blow them a kiss? 
 E: [Kissing noise] 
 SW: And what do you say when it's time to go? 
 E: Goodbye. 
 SW: Good job. Thank you all.,(Applause)The future that we will create can be a future that we'll be proud of.,I think about this every day; it's quite literally my job.,I'm co-founder and senior columnist at Worldchanging.com.,Alex Steffen and I founded Worldchanging in late 2003,,and since then we and our growing global team of contributors,have documented the ever-expanding variety of solutions,that are out there, right now and on the near horizon. 
 In a little over two years, we've written up about 4,000 items --,replicable models, technological tools, emerging ideas --,all providing a path to a future,that's more sustainable, more equitable and more desirable.,Our emphasis on solutions is quite intentional.,There are tons of places to go, online and off,,if what you want to find is the latest bit of news,about just how quickly our hell-bound handbasket is moving.,We want to offer people an idea of what they can do about it.,We focus primarily on the planet's environment,,but we also address issues of global development,,international conflict, responsible use of emerging technologies,,even the rise of the so-called Second Superpower,and much, much more. 
 The scope of solutions that we discuss is actually pretty broad,,but that reflects both the range of challenges that need to be met,and the kinds of innovations that will allow us to do so.,A quick sampling really can barely scratch the surface,,but to give you a sense of what we cover:,tools for rapid disaster relief,,such as this inflatable concrete shelter;,innovative uses of bioscience,,such as a flower that changes color in the presence of landmines;,ultra high-efficiency designs for homes and offices;,distributed power generation using solar power, wind power,,ocean power, other clean energy sources;,ultra, ultra high-efficiency vehicles of the future;,ultra high-efficiency vehicles you can get right now;,and better urban design,,so you don't need to drive as much in the first place;,bio-mimetic approaches to design that take advantage of,the efficiencies of natural models in both vehicles and buildings;,distributed computing projects,that will help us model the future of the climate.,Also, a number of the topics that we've been talking about this week,at TED are things that we've addressed in the past on Worldchanging:,cradle-to-cradle design, MIT's Fab Labs,,the consequences of extreme longevity,,the One Laptop per Child project, even Gapminder. 
 As a born-in-the-mid-1960s Gen X-er,,hurtling all too quickly to my fortieth birthday,,I'm naturally inclined to pessimism. But working at Worldchanging,has convinced me, much to my own surprise,,that successful responses to the world's problems,are nonetheless possible.,Moreover, I've come to realize that focusing only on negative outcomes,can really blind you to the very possibility of success.,As Norwegian social scientist Evelin Lindner has observed,,"Pessimism is a luxury of good times ...,In difficult times, pessimism is,a self-fulfilling, self-inflicted death sentence.",The truth is, we can build a better world,,and we can do so right now.,We have the tools: we saw a hint of that a moment ago,,and we're coming up with new ones all the time.,We have the knowledge,,and our understanding of the planet improves every day.,Most importantly, we have the motive:,we have a world that needs fixing, and nobody's going to do it for us. 
 Many of the solutions that I and my colleagues seek out,and write up every day have some important aspects in common:,transparency, collaboration, a willingness to experiment,,and an appreciation of science -- or, more appropriately, science!,(Laughter),The majority of models, tools and ideas on Worldchanging,encompass combinations of these characteristics, so I want to give you,a few concrete examples of how these principles combine,in world-changing ways. 
 We can see world-changing values in the emergence of tools,to make the invisible visible -- that is,,to make apparent the conditions of the world around us,that would otherwise be largely imperceptible.,We know that people often change their behavior,when they can see and understand the impact of their actions.,As a small example, many of us have experienced,the change in driving behavior that comes from having,a real time display of mileage showing precisely,how one's driving habits affect the vehicle's efficiency.,The last few years have all seen the rise of innovations,in how we measure and display aspects of the world,that can be too big, or too intangible, or too slippery to grasp easily.,Simple technologies, like wall-mounted devices,that display how much power your household is using,,and what kind of results you'll get if you turn off a few lights --,these can actually have a direct positive impact,on your energy footprint.,Community tools, like text messaging, that can tell you,when pollen counts are up or smog levels are rising,or a natural disaster is unfolding,,can give you the information you need to act in a timely fashion.,Data-rich displays like maps of campaign contributions,,or maps of the disappearing polar ice caps,,allow us to better understand the context and the flow,of processes that affect us all. 
 We can see world-changing values in research projects,that seek to meet the world's medical needs,through open access to data and collaborative action.,Now, some people emphasize the risks of knowledge-enabled dangers,,but I'm convinced that the benefits of knowledge-enabled solutions,are far more important.,For example, open-access journals, like the Public Library of Science,,make cutting-edge scientific research free to all --,everyone in the world.,And actually, a growing number of science publishers,are adopting this model.,Last year, hundreds of volunteer biology and chemistry researchers,around the world worked together,to sequence the genome of the parasite responsible,for some of the developing world's worst diseases:,African sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis and Chagas disease.,That genome data can now be found,on open-access genetic data banks around the world,,and it's an enormous boon to researchers,trying to come up with treatments.,But my favorite example has to be the global response,to the SARS epidemic in 2003, 2004, which relied on,worldwide access to the full gene sequence of the SARS virus.,The U.S. National Research Council,in its follow-up report on the outbreak specifically,cited this open availability of the sequence as a key reason,why the treatment for SARS could be developed so quickly. 
 And we can see world-changing values,in something as humble as a cell phone.,I can probably count on my fingers the number of people in this room,who do not use a mobile phone --,and where is Aubrey, because I know he doesn't?,(Laughter),For many of us, cell phones have really become,almost an extension of ourselves,,and we're really now beginning to see the social changes,that mobile phones can bring about.,You may already know some of the big-picture aspects:,globally, more camera phones were sold last year,than any other kind of camera,,and a growing number of people live lives mediated through the lens,,and over the network -- and sometimes enter history books.,In the developing world, mobile phones have become economic drivers.,A study last year showed a direct correlation,between the growth of mobile phone use,and subsequent GDP increases across Africa.,In Kenya, mobile phone minutes,have actually become an alternative currency.,The political aspects of mobile phones can't be ignored either,,from text message swarms in Korea helping to bring down a government,,to the Blairwatch Project in the UK,,keeping tabs on politicians who try to avoid the press.,(Laughter) 
 And it's just going to get more wild.,Pervasive, always-on networks, high quality sound and video,,even devices made to be worn instead of carried in the pocket,,will transform how we live on a scale that few really appreciate.,It's no exaggeration to say that the mobile phone,may be among the world's most important technologies.,And in this rapidly evolving context,,it's possible to imagine a world in which the mobile phone becomes,something far more than a medium for social interaction. 
 I've long admired the Witness project,,and Peter Gabriel told us more details about it on Wednesday,,in his profoundly moving presentation.,And I'm just incredibly happy to see the news,that Witness is going to be opening up a Web portal,to enable users of digital cameras and camera phones,to send in their recordings over the Internet,,rather than just hand-carrying the videotape.,Not only does this add a new and potentially safer avenue,for documenting abuses,,it opens up the program to the growing global digital generation. 
 Now, imagine a similar model for networking environmentalists.,Imagine a Web portal collecting recordings and evidence,of what's happening to the planet:,putting news and data at the fingertips of people of all kinds,,from activists and researchers,to businesspeople and political figures.,It would highlight the changes that are underway,,but would more importantly give voice,to the people who are willing to work,to see a new world, a better world, come about.,It would give everyday citizens,a chance to play a role in the protection of the planet.,It would be, in essence, an "Earth Witness" project.,Now, just to be clear, in this talk I'm using the name "Earth Witness",as part of the scenario, simply as a shorthand,,for what this imaginary project could aspire to,,not to piggyback on the wonderful work of the Witness organization.,It could just as easily be called, "Environmental Transparency Project,","Smart Mobs for Natural Security" --,but Earth Witness is a lot easier to say. 
 Now, many of the people who participate in Earth Witness,would focus on ecological problems, human-caused or otherwise,,especially environmental crimes,and significant sources of greenhouse gases and emissions.,That's understandable and important.,We need better documentation of what's happening to the planet,if we're ever going to have a chance of repairing the damage.,But the Earth Witness project wouldn't need to be limited to problems.,In the best Worldchanging tradition,,it might also serve as a showcase for good ideas, successful projects,and efforts to make a difference that deserve much more visibility.,Earth Witness would show us two worlds:,the world we're leaving behind,,and the world we're building for generations to come. 
 And what makes this scenario particularly appealing to me is,we could do it today.,The key components are already widely available.,Camera phones, of course, would be fundamental to the project.,And for a lot of us, they're as close as we have yet,to always-on, widely available information tools.,We may not remember to bring our digital cameras with us,wherever we go, but very few of us forget our phones.,You could even imagine a version of this scenario,in which people actually build their own phones.,Over the course of last year, open-source hardware hackers,have come up with multiple models,for usable, Linux-based mobile phones,,and the Earth Phone could spin off from this kind of project.,At the other end of the network, there'd be,a server for people to send photos and messages to,,accessible over the Web, combining a photo-sharing service,,social networking platforms and a collaborative filtering system.,Now, you Web 2.0 folks in the audience know what I'm talking about,,but for those of you for whom that last sentence,was in a crazy moon language, I mean simply this:,the online part of the Earth Witness project,would be created by the users, working together and working openly.,That's enough right there to start to build a compelling chronicle,of what's now happening to our planet, but we could do more. 
 An Earth Witness site could also serve as a collection spot,for all sorts of data about conditions around the planet,picked up by environmental sensors that attach to your cell phone.,Now, you don't see these devices as add-ons for phones yet,,but students and engineers around the world,have attached atmospheric sensors to bicycles and handheld computers,and cheap robots and the backs of pigeons --,that being a project that's actually underway right now at U.C. Irvine,,using bird-mounted sensors,as a way of measuring smog-forming pollution.,It's hardly a stretch to imagine putting the same thing,on a phone carried by a person.,Now, the idea of connecting a sensor to your phone is not new:,phone-makers around the world offer phones that sniff for bad breath,,or tell you to worry about too much sun exposure.,Swedish firm Uppsala Biomedical, more seriously, makes,a mobile phone add-on that can process blood tests in the field,,uploading the data, displaying the results.,Even the Lawrence Livermore National Labs have gotten into the act,,designing a prototype phone,that has radiation sensors to find dirty bombs. 
 Now, there's an enormous variety of tiny, inexpensive sensors,on the market, and you can easily imagine someone putting together,a phone that could measure temperature, CO2 or methane levels,,the presence of some biotoxins --,potentially, in a few years, maybe even H5N1 avian flu virus.,You could see that some kind of system like this,would actually be a really good fit,with Larry Brilliant's InSTEDD project.,Now, all of this data could be tagged with geographic information,and mashed up with online maps for easy viewing and analysis.,And that's worth noting in particular.,The impact of open-access online maps over the last year or two,has been simply phenomenal.,Developers around the world have come up with,an amazing variety of ways to layer useful data on top of the maps,,from bus routes and crime statistics,to the global progress of avian flu.,Earth Witness would take this further, linking what you see,with what thousands or millions of other people see around the world. 
 It's kind of exciting to think about what might be accomplished,if something like this ever existed.,We'd have a far better -- far better knowledge,of what's happening on our planet environmentally,than could be gathered with satellites,and a handful of government sensor nets alone.,It would be a collaborative, bottom-up approach,to environmental awareness and protection,,able to respond to emerging concerns in a smart mobs kind of way --,and if you need greater sensor density, just have more people show up.,And most important,,you can't ignore how important mobile phones are to global youth.,This is a system that could put the next generation,at the front lines of gathering environmental data.,And as we work to figure out ways to mitigate,the worst effects of climate disruption,,every little bit of information matters.,A system like Earth Witness would be a tool for all of us,to participate in the improvement of our knowledge and, ultimately,,the improvement of the planet itself. 
 Now, as I suggested at the outset,,there are thousands upon thousands of good ideas out there,,so why have I spent the bulk of my time,telling you about something that doesn't exist?,Because this is what tomorrow could look like:,bottom-up, technology-enabled global collaboration,to handle the biggest crisis our civilization has ever faced.,We can save the planet, but we can't do it alone -- we need each other.,Nobody's going to fix the world for us, but working together,,making use of technological innovations and human communities alike,,we might just be able to fix it ourselves.,We have at our fingertips a cornucopia of compelling models,,powerful tools, and innovative ideas,that can make a meaningful difference in our planet's future.,We don't need to wait for a magic bullet to save us all;,we already have an arsenal of solutions just waiting to be used.,There's a staggering array of wonders out there,,across diverse disciplines, all telling us the same thing:,success can be ours if we're willing to try.,And as we say at Worldchanging,,another world isn't just possible; another world is here.,We just need to open our eyes. Thank you very much.How can we investigate,this flora of viruses that surround us, and aid medicine?,How can we turn our cumulative knowledge of virology,into a simple, hand-held, single diagnostic assay?,I want to turn everything we know right now about detecting viruses,and the spectrum of viruses that are out there,into, let's say, a small chip. 
 When we started thinking about this project --,how we would make a single diagnostic assay,to screen for all pathogens simultaneously --,well, there's some problems with this idea.,First of all, viruses are pretty complex,,but they're also evolving very fast.,This is a picornavirus.,Picornaviruses -- these are things that include,the common cold and polio, things like this.,You're looking at the outside shell of the virus,,and the yellow color here are those parts of the virus,that are evolving very, very fast,,and the blue parts are not evolving very fast.,When people think about making pan-viral detection reagents,,usually it's the fast-evolving problem that's an issue,,because how can we detect things if they're always changing?,But evolution is a balance:,where you have fast change, you also have ultra-conservation --,things that almost never change. 
 And so we looked into this a little more carefully,,and I'm going to show you data now.,This is just some stuff you can do on the computer from the desktop.,I took a bunch of these small picornaviruses,,like the common cold, like polio and so on,,and I just broke them down into small segments.,And so took this first example, which is called coxsackievirus,,and just break it into small windows.,And I'm coloring these small windows blue,if another virus shares an identical sequence in its genome,to that virus.,These sequences right up here --,which don't even code for protein, by the way --,are almost absolutely identical across all of these,,so I could use this sequence as a marker,to detect a wide spectrum of viruses,,without having to make something individual.,Now, over here there's great diversity:,that's where things are evolving fast.,Down here you can see slower evolution: less diversity. 
 Now, by the time we get out here to, let's say,,acute bee paralysis virus --,probably a bad one to have if you're a bee ---,this virus shares almost no similarity to coxsackievirus,,but I can guarantee you that the sequences that are most conserved,among these viruses on the right-hand of the screen,are in identical regions right up here.,And so we can encapsulate these regions of ultra-conservation,through evolution -- how these viruses evolved --,by just choosing DNA elements or RNA elements,in these regions to represent on our chip as detection reagents. 
 OK, so that's what we did, but how are we going to do that?,Well, for a long time, since I was in graduate school,,I've been messing around making DNA chips --,that is, printing DNA on glass.,And that's what you see here:,These little salt spots are just DNA tacked onto glass,,and so I can put thousands of these on our glass chip,and use them as a detection reagent.,We took our chip over to Hewlett-Packard,and used their atomic force microscope on one of these spots,,and this is what you see:,you can actually see the strands of DNA lying flat on the glass here.,So, what we're doing is just printing DNA on glass --,little flat things -- and these are going to be markers for pathogens.,OK, I make little robots in lab to make these chips,,and I'm really big on disseminating technology.,If you've got enough money to buy just a Camry,,you can build one of these too,,and so we put a deep how-to guide on the Web, totally free,,with basically order-off-the-shelf parts.,You can build a DNA array machine in your garage.,Here's the section on the all-important emergency stop switch.,(Laughter),Every important machine's got to have a big red button.,But really, it's pretty robust.,You can actually be making DNA chips in your garage,and decoding some genetic programs pretty rapidly. It's a lot of fun.,(Laughter) 
 And so what we did -- and this is a really cool project --,we just started by making a respiratory virus chip.,I talked about that --,you know, that situation where you go into the clinic,and you don't get diagnosed?,Well, we just put basically all the human respiratory viruses,on one chip, and we threw in herpes virus for good measure --,I mean, why not?,The first thing you do as a scientist is,,you make sure stuff works.,And so what we did is, we take tissue culture cells,and infect them with various viruses,,and we take the stuff and fluorescently label the nucleic acid,,the genetic material that comes out of these tissue culture cells --,mostly viral stuff -- and stick it on the array to see where it sticks.,Now, if the DNA sequences match, they'll stick together,,and so we can look at spots.,And if spots light up, we know there's a certain virus in there. 
 That's what one of these chips really looks like,,and these red spots are, in fact, signals coming from the virus.,And each spot represents a different family of virus,or species of virus.,And so, that's a hard way to look at things,,so I'm just going to encode things as a little barcode,,grouped by family, so you can see the results in a very intuitive way.,What we did is, we took tissue culture cells,and infected them with adenovirus,,and you can see this little yellow barcode next to adenovirus.,And, likewise, we infected them with parainfluenza-3 --,that's a paramyxovirus -- and you see a little barcode here.,And then we did respiratory syncytial virus.,That's the scourge of daycare centers everywhere --,it's like boogeremia, basically.,(Laughter),You can see that this barcode is the same family,,but it's distinct from parainfluenza-3,,which gives you a very bad cold.,And so we're getting unique signatures, a fingerprint for each virus.,Polio and rhino: they're in the same family, very close to each other.,Rhino's the common cold, and you all know what polio is,,and you can see that these signatures are distinct.,And Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus,gives a nice signature down here.,And so it is not any one stripe or something,that tells me I have a virus of a particular type here;,it's the barcode that in bulk represents the whole thing. 
 All right, I can see a rhinovirus --,and here's the blow-up of the rhinovirus's little barcode --,but what about different rhinoviruses?,How do I know which rhinovirus I have?,There're 102 known variants of the common cold,,and there're only 102 because people got bored collecting them:,there are just new ones every year.,And so, here are four different rhinoviruses,,and you can see, even with your eye,,without any fancy computer pattern-matching,recognition software algorithms,,that you can distinguish each one of these barcodes from each other. 
 Now, this is kind of a cheap shot,,because I know what the genetic sequence of all these rhinoviruses is,,and I in fact designed the chip,expressly to be able to tell them apart,,but what about rhinoviruses that have never seen a genetic sequencer?,We don't know what the sequence is; just pull them out of the field.,So, here are four rhinoviruses,we never knew anything about --,no one's ever sequenced them -- and you can also see,that you get unique and distinguishable patterns.,You can imagine building up some library, whether real or virtual,,of fingerprints of essentially every virus.,But that's, again, shooting fish in a barrel, you know, right?,You have tissue culture cells. There are a ton of viruses.,What about real people?,You can't control real people, as you probably know.,You have no idea what someone's going to cough into a cup,,and it's probably really complex, right?,It could have lots of bacteria, it could have more than one virus,,and it certainly has host genetic material.,So how do we deal with this?,And how do we do the positive control here? 
 Well, it's pretty simple.,That's me, getting a nasal lavage.,And the idea is, let's experimentally inoculate people with virus.,This is all IRB-approved, by the way; they got paid.,And basically we experimentally inoculate people,with the common cold virus.,Or, even better, let's just take people,right out of the emergency room --,undefined, community-acquired respiratory tract infections.,You have no idea what walks in through the door.,So, let's start off with the positive control first,,where we know the person was healthy.,They got a shot of virus up the nose,,let's see what happens. 
 Day zero: nothing happening.,They're healthy; they're clean -- it's amazing.,Actually, we thought the nasal tract might be full of viruses,even when you're walking around healthy.,It's pretty clean. If you're healthy, you're pretty healthy.,Day two: we get a very robust rhinovirus pattern,,and it's very similar to what we get in the lab,doing our tissue culture experiment.,So that's great, but again, cheap shot, right?,We put a ton of virus up this guy's nose. So --,(Laughter),-- I mean, we wanted it to work. He really had a cold.,So, how about the people who walk in off the street? 
 Here are two individuals represented by their anonymous ID codes.,They both have rhinoviruses; we've never seen this pattern in lab.,We sequenced part of their viruses;,they're new rhinoviruses no one's actually even seen.,Remember, our evolutionary-conserved sequences,we're using on this array allow us to detect,even novel or uncharacterized viruses,,because we pick what is conserved throughout evolution.,Here's another guy. You can play the diagnosis game yourself here.,These different blocks represent,the different viruses in this paramyxovirus family,,so you can kind of go down the blocks,and see where the signal is.,Well, doesn't have canine distemper; that's probably good.,(Laughter),But by the time you get to block nine,,you see that respiratory syncytial virus.,Maybe they have kids. And then you can see, also,,the family member that's related: RSVB is showing up here.,So, that's great.,Here's another individual, sampled on two separate days --,repeat visits to the clinic.,This individual has parainfluenza-1,,and you can see that there's a little stripe over here,for Sendai virus: that's mouse parainfluenza.,The genetic relationships are very close there. That's a lot of fun. 
 So, we built out the chip.,We made a chip that has every known virus ever discovered on it.,Why not? Every plant virus, every insect virus, every marine virus.,Everything that we could get out of GenBank --,that is, the national repository of sequences.,Now we're using this chip. And what are we using it for?,Well, first of all, when you have a big chip like this,,you need a little bit more informatics,,so we designed the system to do automatic diagnosis.,And the idea is that we simply have virtual patterns,,because we're never going to get samples of every virus --,it would be virtually impossible. But we can get virtual patterns,,and compare them to our observed result --,which is a very complex mixture -- and come up with some sort of score,of how likely it is this is a rhinovirus or something.,And this is what this looks like.,If, for example, you used a cell culture,that's chronically infected with papilloma,,you get a little computer readout here,,and our algorithm says it's probably papilloma type 18.,And that is, in fact, what these particular cell cultures,are chronically infected with. 
 So let's do something a little bit harder.,We put the beeper in the clinic.,When somebody shows up, and the hospital doesn't know what to do,because they can't diagnose it, they call us.,That's the idea, and we're setting this up in the Bay Area.,And so, this case report happened three weeks ago.,We have a 28-year-old healthy woman, no travel history,,[unclear], doesn't smoke, doesn't drink.,10-day history of fevers, night sweats, bloody sputum --,she's coughing up blood -- muscle pain.,She went to the clinic, and they gave her antibiotics,and then sent her home.,She came back after ten days of fever, right? Still has the fever,,and she's hypoxic -- she doesn't have much oxygen in her lungs.,They did a CT scan.,A normal lung is all sort of dark and black here.,All this white stuff -- it's not good.,This sort of tree and bud formation indicates there's inflammation;,there's likely to be infection.,OK. So, the patient was treated then,with a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic and doxycycline,,and on day three, it didn't help: she had progressed to acute failure.,They had to intubate her, so they put a tube down her throat,and they began to mechanically ventilate her.,She could no longer breathe for herself.,What to do next? Don't know.,Switch antibiotics: so they switched to another antibiotic,,Tamiflu.,It's not clear why they thought she had the flu,,but they switched to Tamiflu. 
 And on day six, they basically threw in the towel.,You do an open lung biopsy when you've got no other options.,There's an eight percent mortality rate with just doing this procedure,,and so basically -- and what do they learn from it?,You're looking at her open lung biopsy.,And I'm no pathologist, but you can't tell much from this.,All you can tell is, there's a lot of swelling: bronchiolitis.,It was "unrevealing": that's the pathologist's report.,And so, what did they test her for?,They have their own tests, of course,,and so they tested her for over 70 different assays,,for every sort of bacteria and fungus and viral assay,you can buy off the shelf:,SARS, metapneumovirus, HIV, RSV -- all these.,Everything came back negative, over 100,000 dollars worth of tests.,I mean, they went to the max for this woman. 
 And basically on hospital day eight, that's when they called us.,They gave us endotracheal aspirate --,you know, a little fluid from the throat,,from this tube that they got down there -- and they gave us this.,We put it on the chip; what do we see? Well, we saw parainfluenza-4.,Well, what the hell's parainfluenza-4?,No one tests for parainfluenza-4. No one cares about it.,In fact, it's not even really sequenced that much.,There's just a little bit of it sequenced.,There's almost no epidemiology or studies on it.,No one would even consider it,,because no one had a clue that it could cause respiratory failure.,And why is that? Just lore. There's no data --,no data to support whether it causes severe or mild disease.,Clearly, we have a case of a healthy person that's going down. 
 OK, that's one case report.,I'm going to tell you one last thing in the last two minutes,that's unpublished -- it's going to come out tomorrow --,and it's an interesting case of how you might use this chip,to find something new and open a new door.,Prostate cancer. I don't need to give you many statistics,about prostate cancer. Most of you already know it:,third leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S.,Lots of risk factors,,but there is a genetic predisposition to prostate cancer.,For maybe about 10 percent of prostate cancer,,there are folks that are predisposed to it.,And the first gene that was mapped in association studies,for this, early-onset prostate cancer, was this gene called RNASEL.,What is that? It's an antiviral defense enzyme.,So, we're sitting around and thinking,,"Why would men who have the mutation --,a defect in an antiviral defense system -- get prostate cancer?,It doesn't make sense -- unless, maybe, there's a virus?" 
 So, we put tumors --- and now we have over 100 tumors -- on our array.,And we know who's got defects in RNASEL and who doesn't.,And I'm showing you the signal from the chip here,,and I'm showing you for the block of retroviral oligos.,And what I'm telling you here from the signal, is,that men who have a mutation in this antiviral defense enzyme,,and have a tumor, often have -- 40 percent of the time --,a signature which reveals a new retrovirus.,OK, that's pretty wild. What is it?,So, we clone the whole virus.,First of all, I'll tell you that a little automated prediction told us,it was very similar to a mouse virus.,But that doesn't tell us too much,,so we actually clone the whole thing.,And the viral genome I'm showing you right here?,It's a classic gamma retrovirus, but it's totally new;,no one's ever seen it before.,Its closest relative is, in fact, from mice,,and so we would call this a xenotropic retrovirus,,because it's infecting a species other than mice.,And this is a little phylogenetic tree,to see how it's related to other viruses.,We've done it for many patients now,,and we can say that they're all independent infections.,They all have the same virus,,but they're different enough that there's reason to believe,that they've been independently acquired.,Is it really in the tissue? And I'll end up with this: yes.,We take slices of these biopsies of tumor tissue,and use material to actually locate the virus,,and we find cells here with viral particles in them.,These guys really do have this virus. 
 Does this virus cause prostate cancer?,Nothing I'm saying here implies causality. I don't know.,Is it a link to oncogenesis? I don't know.,Is it the case that these guys are just more susceptible to viruses?,Could be. And it might have nothing to do with cancer.,But now it's a door.,We have a strong association between the presence of this virus,and a genetic mutation that's been linked to cancer.,That's where we're at.,So, it opens up more questions than it answers, I'm afraid,,but that's what, you know, science is really good at.,This was all done by folks in the lab --,I cannot take credit for most of this.,This is a collaboration between myself and Don.,This is the guy who started the project in my lab,,and this is the guy who's been doing prostate stuff.,Thank you very much. (Applause)This meeting has really been about a digital revolution,,but I'd like to argue that it's done; we won.,We've had a digital revolution but we don't need to keep having it.,And I'd like to look after that,,to look what comes after the digital revolution.,So, let me start projecting forward.,These are some projects I'm involved in today at MIT,,looking what comes after computers. 
 This first one, Internet Zero, up here -- this is a web server,that has the cost and complexity of an RFID tag --,about a dollar -- that can go in every light bulb and doorknob,,and this is getting commercialized very quickly.,And what's interesting about it isn't the cost;,it's the way it encodes the Internet.,It uses a kind of a Morse code for the Internet,so you could send it optically; you can communicate acoustically,through a power line, through RF.,It takes the original principle of the Internet,,which is inter-networking computers,,and now lets devices inter-network.,That we can take the whole idea that gave birth to the Internet,and bring it down to the physical world in this Internet Zero,,this internet of devices. 
 So this is the next step from there to here,,and this is getting commercialized today.,A step after that is a project on fungible computers.,Fungible goods in economics can be extended and traded.,So, half as much grain is half as much useful,,but half a baby or half a computer is less useful than,a whole baby or a whole computer,,and we've been trying to make computers that work that way.,So, what you see in the background is a prototype.,This was from a thesis of a student, Bill Butow, now at Intel,,who wondered why, instead of making bigger and bigger chips,,you don't make small chips, put them in a viscous medium,,and pour out computing by the pound or by the square inch.,And that's what you see here.,On the left was postscript being rendered by a conventional computer;,on the right is postscript being rendered from the first prototype,we made, but there's no frame buffer, IO processor,,any of that stuff -- it's just this material.,Unlike this screen where the dots are placed carefully,,this is a raw material.,If you add twice as much of it, you have twice as much display.,If you shoot a gun through the middle, nothing happens.,If you need more resource, you just apply more computer. 
 So, that's the step after this -- of computing as a raw material.,That's still conventional bits, the step after that is --,this is an earlier prototype in the lab;,this is high-speed video slowed down.,Now, integrating chemistry in computation, where the bits are bubbles.,This is showing making bits, this is showing --,once again, slowed down so you can see it,,bits interacting to do logic and multiplexing and de-multiplexing.,So, now we can compute that the output arranges material,as well as information. And, ultimately, these are some slides,from an early project I did, computing where the bits are stored,quantum-mechanically in the nuclei of atoms, so,programs rearrange the nuclear structure of molecules.,All of these are in the lab pushing further and further and further,,not as metaphor but literally integrating bits and atoms,,and they lead to the following recognition. 
 We all know we've had a digital revolution, but what is that?,Well, Shannon took us, in the '40s, from here to here:,from a telephone being a speaker wire that degraded with distance,to the Internet. And he proved the first threshold theorem, that shows,if you add information and remove it to a signal,,you can compute perfectly with an imperfect device.,And that's when we got the Internet.,Von Neumann, in the '50s, did the same thing for computing;,he showed you can have an unreliable computer but restore its state,to make it perfect. This was the last great analog computer at MIT:,a differential analyzer, and the more you ran it,,the worse the answer got. 
 After Von Neumann, we have the Pentium, where the billionth transistor,is as reliable as the first one.,But all our fabrication is down in this lower left corner.,A state-of-the-art airplane factory rotating metal wax at fixed metal,,or you maybe melt some plastic. A 10-billion-dollar chip fab,uses a process a village artisan would recognize --,you spread stuff around and bake it.,All the intelligence is external to the system;,the materials don't have information.,Yesterday you heard about molecular biology,,which fundamentally computes to build.,It's an information processing system.,We've had digital revolutions in communication and computation,,but precisely the same idea, precisely the same math,Shannon and Von Neuman did, hasn't yet come out,to the physical world. So, inspired by that,,colleagues in this program -- the Center for Bits and Atoms,at MIT -- which is a group of people, like me,,who never understood the boundary between physical science,and computer science. I would even go further and say,computer science is one of the worst things that ever happened,to either computers or to science --,(Laughter),-- because the canon -- computer science --,many of them are great but the canon of computer science,prematurely froze a model of computation,based on technology that was available in 1950,,and nature's a much more powerful computer than that. 
 So, you'll hear, tomorrow, from Saul Griffith. He was one of the,first students to emerge from this program.,We started to figure out how you can compute to fabricate.,This was just a proof of principle he did of tiles,that interact magnetically, where you write a code,,much like protein folding, that specifies their structure.,So, there's no feedback to a tool metrology;,the material itself codes for its structure in just the same ways,that protein are fabricated. So, you can, for example, do that.,You can do other things. That's in 2D. It works in 3D.,The video on the upper right -- I won't show for time --,shows self-replication, templating so something can make something,that can make something, and we're doing that now over, maybe,,nine orders of magnitude. Those ideas have been used to show,the best fidelity and direct rate DNA to make an organism,,in functionalizing nanoclusters with peptide tails,that code for their assembly -- so, much like the magnets,,but now on nanometer scales.,Laser micro-machining: essentially 3D printers that digitally fabricate,functional systems, all the way up to building buildings,,not by having blueprints,,but having the parts code for the structure of the building. 
 So, these are early examples in the lab of emerging technologies,to digitize fabrication. Computers that don't control tools,but computers that are tools, where the output of a program,rearranges atoms as well as bits.,Now, to do that -- with your tax dollars, thank you --,I bought all these machines. We made a modest proposal,to the NSF. We wanted to be able to make anything on any length scale,,all in one place, because you can't segregate digital fabrication,by a discipline or a length scale.,So we put together focused nano beam writers,and supersonic water jet cutters and excimer micro-machining systems. 
 But I had a problem. Once I had all these machines,,I was spending too much time teaching students to use them.,So I started teaching a class, modestly called,,"How To Make Almost Anything." And that wasn't meant to be provocative;,it was just for a few research students.,But the first day of class looked like this.,You know, hundreds of people came in begging,,all my life I've been waiting for this class; I'll do anything to do it.,Then they'd ask, can you teach it at MIT? It seems too useful?,And then the next --,(Laughter),-- surprising thing was they weren't there to do research.,They were there because they wanted to make stuff.,They had no conventional technical background.,At the end of a semester they integrated their skills. 
 I'll show an old video. Kelly was a sculptor, and this is what she did,with her semester project. 
 (Video): Kelly: Hi, I'm Kelly and this is my scream buddy.,Do you ever find yourself in a situation,where you really have to scream, but you can't because you're at work,,or you're in a classroom, or you're watching your children,,or you're in any number of situations where it's just not permitted?,Well, scream buddy is a portable space for screaming.,When a user screams into scream buddy, their scream is silenced.,It is also recorded for later release where, when and how,the user chooses.,(Scream),(Laughter) (Applause) 
 So, Einstein would like this.,This student made a web browser for parrots --,lets parrots surf the Net and talk to other parrots.,This student's made an alarm clock you wrestle,to prove you're awake; this is one that defends --,a dress that defends your personal space.,This isn't technology for communication;,it's technology to prevent it.,This is a device that lets you see your music.,This is a student who made a machine that makes machines,,and he made it by making Lego bricks that do the computing.,Just year after year -- and I finally realized,the students were showing the killer app of personal fabrication,is products for a market of one person.,You don't need this for what you can get in Wal-Mart;,you need this for what makes you unique.,Ken Olsen famously said, nobody needs a computer in the home.,But you don't use it for inventory and payroll;,DEC is now twice bankrupt. You don't need personal fabrication,in the home to buy what you can buy because you can buy it.,You need it for what makes you unique, just like personalization.,So, with that, in turn, 20 million dollars today does this;,20 years from now we'll make Star Trek replicators that make anything.,The students hijacked all the machines I bought to do personal fabrication. 
 Today, when you spend that much of your money,,there's a government requirement to do outreach, which often means,classes at a local school, a website -- stuff that's just not that exciting.,So, I made a deal with my NSF program managers that,instead of talking about it, I'd give people the tools.,This wasn't meant to be provocative or important,,but we put together these Fab Labs. It's about 20,000 dollars in equipment,that approximate both what the 20 million dollars does and where it's going.,A laser cutter to do press-fit assembly with 3D from 2D,,a sign cutter to plot in copper to do electromagnetics,,a micron scale,,numerically-controlled milling machine for precise structures,,programming tools for less than a dollar,,100-nanosecond microcontrollers. It lets you work from microns,and microseconds on up, and they exploded around the world.,This wasn't scheduled, but they went from inner-city Boston,to Pobal in India, to Secondi-Takoradi on Ghana's coast,to Soshanguve in a township in South Africa,,to the far north of Norway, uncovering, or helping uncover,,for all the attention to the digital divide,,we would find unused computers in all these places.,A farmer in a rural village -- a kid needs to measure and modify,the world, not just get information about it on a screen.,That there's really a fabrication and an instrumentation divide,bigger than the digital divide.,And the way you close it is not IT for the masses but IT development for the masses. 
 So, in place after place,we saw this same progression: that we'd open one of these Fab Labs,,where we didn't -- this is too crazy to think of.,We didn't think this up, that we would get pulled to these places;,we'd open it. The first step was just empowerment.,You can see it in their face, just this joy of, I can do it.,This is a girl in inner-city Boston who had just done a high-tech,on-demand craft sale in the inner city community center.,It goes on from there to serious hands-on technical education,informally, out of schools. In Ghana we had set up one of these labs.,We designed a network sensor, and kids would show up,and refuse to leave the lab.,There was a girl who insisted we stay late at night --,(Video): Kids: I love the Fab Lab.,-- her first night in the lab because she was going to make the sensor.,So she insisted on fabbing the board, learning how to stuff it,,learning how to program it. She didn't really know,what she was doing or why she was doing it, but she knew,she just had to do it. There was something electric about it.,This is late at, you know, 11 o'clock at night,and I think I was the only person surprised when what she built,worked the first time.,And I've shown this to engineers at big companies, and they say,they can't do this. Any one thing she's doing, they can do better,,but it's distributed over many people and many sites,and they can't do in an afternoon,what this little girl in rural Ghana is doing.,(Video): Girl: My name is Valentina Kofi; I am eight years old.,I made a stacking board.,And, again, that was just for the joy of it. 
 Then these labs started doing serious problem solving --,instrumentation for agriculture in India,,steam turbines for energy conversion in Ghana,,high-gain antennas in thin client computers.,And then, in turn, businesses started to grow,,like making these antennas.,And finally, the lab started doing invention.,We're learning more from them than we're giving them.,I was showing my kids in a Fab Lab how to use it.,They invented a way to do a construction kit out of a cardboard box --,which, as you see up there, that's becoming a business --,but their design was better than Saul's design at MIT,,so there's now three students at MIT doing their theses on,scaling the work of eight-year-old children,because they had better designs.,Real invention is happening in these labs. 
 And I still kept -- so, in the last year I've been spending time with,heads of state and generals and tribal chiefs who all want this,,and I keep saying, but this isn't the real thing.,Wait, like, 20 years and then we'll be done.,And I finally got what's been going on. This is Kernigan and Ritchie,inventing UNIX on a PDP.,PDPs came between mainframes and minicomputers.,They were tens of thousands of dollars, hard to use,,but they brought computing down to work groups,,and everything we do today happened there.,These Fab Labs are the cost and complexity of a PDP.,The projection of digital fabrication,isn't a projection for the future; we are now in the PDP era.,We talked in hushed tones about the great discoveries then.,It was very chaotic, it wasn't, sort of, clear what was going on.,In the same sense we are now, today, in the minicomputer era,of digital fabrication.,The only problem with that is it breaks everybody's boundaries. 
 In DC, I go to every agency that wants to talk, you know;,in the Bay Area, I go to every organization you can think of --,they all want to talk about it, but it breaks,their organizational boundaries. In fact, it's illegal for them,,in many cases, to equip ordinary people to create,rather than consume technology.,And that problem is so severe that the ultimate invention,coming from this community surprised me:,it's the social engineering. That the lab in far north of Norway --,this is so far north its satellite dishes look at the ground,rather than the sky because that's where the satellites are --,the lab outgrew the little barn that it was in.,It was there because they wanted to find animals in the mountains,but it outgrew it, so they built this extraordinary village for the lab.,This isn't a university; it's not a company. It's essentially,a village for invention; it's a village for the outliers in society,,and those have been growing up around these Fab Labs,all around the world. 
 So this program has split into an NGO foundation,,a Fab Foundation to support the scaling, a micro VC fund.,The person who runs it nicely describes it as,"machines that make machines need businesses that make businesses:",it's a cross between micro-finance and VC to do fan-out,,and then the research partnerships back at MIT for what's,making it possible. 
 So I'd like to leave you with two thoughts.,There's been a sea change in aid, from top-down mega-projects,to bottom-up, grassroots, micro-finance investing in the roots,,so that everybody's got that that's what works.,But we still look at technology as top-down mega-projects.,Computing, communication, energy for the rest of the planet,are these top-down mega-projects.,If this room full of heroes is just clever enough,,you can solve the problems.,The message coming from the Fab Labs is that,the other five billion people on the planet,aren't just technical sinks; they're sources.,The real opportunity is to harness the inventive power of the world,to locally design and produce solutions to local problems.,I thought that's the projection 20 years hence into the future,,but it's where we are today.,It breaks every organizational boundary we can think of.,The hardest thing at this point is the social engineering,and the organizational engineering, but it's here today. 
 And, finally, any talk like this on the future of computing,is required to show Moore's law, but my favorite version --,this is Gordon Moore's original one from his original paper --,and what's happened is, year after year after year,,we've scaled and we've scaled and we've scaled,and we've scaled, and we've scaled and we've scaled,,and we've scaled and we've scaled,,and there's this looming bug of what's going to happen,at the end of Moore's law; this ultimate bug is coming.,But we're coming to appreciate, is the transition from 2D to 3D,,from programming bits to programming atoms,,turns the ends of Moore's law scaling from the ultimate bug,to the ultimate feature.,So, we're just at the edge of this digital revolution in fabrication,,where the output of computation programs the physical world.,So, together, these two projects answer questions,I hadn't asked carefully. The class at MIT shows the killer app,for personal fabrication in the developed world,is technology for a market of one: personal expression in technology,that touches a passion unlike anything I've seen in technology,for a very long time.,And the killer app for the rest of the planet is the instrumentation,and the fabrication divide: people locally developing solutions,to local problems. Thank you.The career that I started early on in my life,was looking for exotic life forms in exotic places,,and at that time I was working in the Antarctic and the Arctic,,and high deserts and low deserts.,Until about a dozen years ago, when I was really captured by caves,,and I really re-focused most of my research in that direction. 
 So I have a really cool day job-- I get to do some really amazing stuff.,I work in some of the most extreme cave environments on the planet.,Many of them are trying to kill us from the minute we go into them,,but nevertheless, they're absolutely gripping,,and contain unbelievable biological wonders,that are very, very different from those that we have on the planet.,Apart from the intrinsic value,of the biology and mineralogy and geo-microbiology that we do there,,we're also using these as templates,for figuring out how to go look,for life on other planets.,Particularly Mars, but also Europa,,the small, icy moon around Jupiter.,And perhaps, someday, far beyond our solar system itself. 
 I'm very passionately interested in the human future,,on the Moon and Mars particularly,,and elsewhere in the solar system.,I think it's time that we transitioned,to a solar system-going civilization and species.,And, as an outgrowth of all of this then,,I wonder about whether we can, and whether we even should,,think about transporting Earth-type life to other planets.,Notably Mars, as a first example. 
 Something I never talk about in scientific meetings,is how I actually got to this state,and why I do the work that I do.,Why don't I have a normal job, a sensible job?,And then of course, I blame the Soviet Union.,Because in the mid-1950s,,when I was a tiny child,,they had the audacity to launch,a very primitive little satellite called Sputnik,,which sent the Western world into a hysterical tailspin.,And a tremendous amount of money,went into the funding of science,and mathematics skills for kids.,And I'm a product of that generation,,like so many other of my peers.,It really caught hold of us, and caught fire,,and it would be lovely if we could reproduce that again now. 
 Of course, refusing to grow up --,-- even though I impersonate a grown-up in daily life,,but I do a fairly good job of that --,but really retaining that childlike quality,of not caring what other people think,about what you're interested in, is really critical.,The next element is the fact that,I have applied a value judgment,and my value judgment is that the presence of life,is better than no life.,And so, life is more valuable than no life.,And so I think that that holds together,a great deal of the work,that people in this audience approach. 
 I'm very interested in Mars, of course,,and that was a product of my being a young undergraduate,when the Viking Landers landed on Mars.,And that took what had been,a tiny little astronomical object in the sky,,that you would see as a dot,,and turned it completely into a landscape,,as that very first primitive picture,came rastering across the screen.,And when it became a landscape,,it also became a destination,,and altered, really, the course of my life. 
 In my graduate years I worked with,my colleague and mentor and friend, Steve Schneider,,at the National Center for Atmospheric Research,,working on global change issues.,We've written a number of things on,the role of Gaia hypothesis --,whether or not you could consider Earth as a single entity,in any meaningful scientific sense,,and then, as an outgrowth of that,,I worked on the environmental consequences of nuclear war. 
 So, wonderful things and grim things.,But what it taught me was to look at Earth as a planet,with external eyes, not just as our home.,And that is a wonderful stepping away in perspective,,to try to then think about the way,our planet behaves, as a planet,,and with the life that's on it.,And all of this seems to me to be,a salient point in history.,We're getting ready to begin to go,through the process of leaving our planet of origin,and out into the wider solar system and beyond. 
 So, back to Mars.,How hard is it going to be to find life on Mars?,Well, sometimes it's really very hard for us to find each other,,even on this planet.,So, finding life on another planet,is a non-trivial occupation,and we spend a lot of time trying to think about that.,Whether or not you think it's likely to be successful,sort of depends on what you think about,the chances of life in the universe.,I think, myself,,that life is a natural outgrowth,of the increasing complexification of matter over time. 
 So, you start with the Big Bang and you get hydrogen,,and then you get helium, and then you get more complicated stuff,,and you get planets forming --,and life is a common, planetary-based phenomenon, in my view.,Certainly, in the last 15 years,,we've seen increasing numbers of planets,outside of our solar system being confirmed,,and just last month, a couple of weeks ago,,a planet in the size-class of Earth,has actually been found.,And so this is very exciting news. 
 So, my first bold prediction is that,,is that in the universe, life is going to be everywhere.,It's going to be everywhere we look --,where there are planetary systems that can possibly support it.,And those planetary systems are going to be very common.,So, what about life on Mars?,Well, if somebody had asked me about a dozen years ago,what I thought the chances of life on Mars would be,,I would've probably said, a couple of percent.,And even that was considered outrageous at the time.,I was once sneeringly introduced,by a former NASA official,,as the only person on the planet,who still thought there was life on Mars.,Of course, that official is now dead, and I'm not,,so there's a certain amount of glory,in outliving your adversaries. 
 But things have changed greatly,over the last dozen years.,And the reason that they have changed,is because we now have new information.,The amazing Pathfinder mission that went in '97,,and the MER Rover missions,that are on Mars as we speak now,and the European Space Agency's Mars Express,,has taught us a number of amazing things.,There is sub-surface ice on that planet.,And so where there is water,,there is a very high chance of our kind of life.,There's clearly sedimentary rocks all over the place –,one of the landers is sitting in the middle of an ancient seabed,,and there are these amazing structures called blueberries,,which are these little, rocky concretions,that we are busy making biologically,in my lab right now. 
 So, with all of these things put together,,I think that the chances of life,are much greater than I would've ever thought.,I think that the chance of life having arisen on Mars, sometime in its past,,is maybe one in four to maybe even half and half.,So this is a very bold statement.,I think it's there, and I think we need,to go look for it, and I think it's underground.,So the game's afoot, and this is the game that we play in astro-biology.,How do you try to get a handle on extraterrestrial life?,How do you plan to look for it?,How do you know it when you find it?,Because if it's big and obvious, we would've already found it --,it would've already bitten us on the foot, and it hasn't. 
 So, we know that it's probably quite cryptic.,Very critically, how do we protect it,,if we find it, and not contaminate it?,And also, even perhaps more critically, because,this is the only home planet we have,,how do we protect us from it, while we study it?,So why might it be hard to find?,Well, it's probably microscopic, and it's never easy,to study microscopic things,,although the amazing tools that we now have to do that,allow us to study things in much greater depth,,at much smaller scales than ever before.,But it's probably hiding, because if you are out,sequestering resources from your environment, that makes you yummy,,and other things might want to eat you, or consume you.,And so, there's a game of predator-prey,that's going to be, essentially, universal, really,,in any kind of biological system.,It also may be very, very different in its fundamental properties –,its chemistry, or its size. 
 We say small, but what does that mean?,Is it virus-sized? Is it smaller than that?,Is it bigger than the biggest bacterium? We don't know.,And speed of activity, which is something that we face,in our work with sub-surface organisms,,because they grow very, very slowly.,If I were to take a swab off your teeth,and plate it on a Petri plate,,within about four or five hours, I would have to see growth.,But the organisms that we work with,,from the sub-surface of Earth,,very often it's months -- and in many cases, years --,before we see any growth whatsoever.,So they are, intrinsically, a slower life-form. 
 But the real issue is that we are guided by,our limited experience,,and until we can think out of the box of our cranium and what we know,,then we can't recognize what to look for,,or how to plan for it.,So, perspective is everything,and, because of the history that I've just briefly talked to you about,,I have learned to think about Earth,as an extraterrestrial planet.,And this has been invaluable in our approach to try to study these things. 
 This is my favorite game on airplanes:,where you're in an airplane and you look out the window,,you see the horizon.,I always turn my head on the side,,and that simple change makes me go from,seeing this planet as home,,to seeing it as a planet.,It's a very simple trick, and I never fail to do it,when I'm sitting in a window seat.,Well, this is what we apply to our work.,This shows one of the most extreme caves that we work in.,This is Cueva de Villa Luz in Tabasco, in Mexico,,and this cave is saturated with sulfuric acid.,There is tremendous amounts of hydrogen sulfide,coming into this cave from volcanic sources,and from the breakdown of evaporite --,minerals below the carbonates in which this cave is formed --,and it is a completely hostile environment for us.,We have to go in with protective suits and breathing gear,,and 30 parts per million of H2S will kill you.,This is regularly several hundred parts per million.,So, it's a very hazardous environment,,with CO as well, and many other gases.,These extreme physical and chemical parameters,make the biology that grows in these places very special.,Because contrary to what you might think, this is not devoid of life. 
 This is one of the richest caves,that we have found on the planet, anywhere.,It's bursting with life.,The extremes on Earth are interesting in their own right,,but one of the reasons that we're interested in them,is because they represent, really,,the average conditions that we may expect on other planets.,So, this is part of the ability that we have,,to try to stretch our imagination,,in terms of what we may find in the future.,There's so much life in this cave,,and I can't even begin,to scratch the surface of it with you. 
 But one of the most famous objects out of this,are what we call Snottites, for obvious reasons.,This stuff looks like what comes out of your two-year-old's nose when he has a cold.,And this is produced by bacteria who are actually,making more sulfuric acid,,and living at pHs right around zero.,And so, this stuff is like battery acid.,And yet, everything in this cave has adapted to it.,In fact, there's so much energy available,for biology in this cave,,that there's actually a huge number of cavefish.,And the local Zoque Indians,harvest this twice a year,,as part of their Easter week celebration and Holy Week celebration. 
 This is very unusual for caves.,In some of the other amazing caves that we work in --,this is in Lechuguilla cave in New Mexico near Carlsbad,,and this is one of the most famous caves in the world.,It's 115 miles of mapped passage,,it's pristine, it has no natural opening,and it's a gigantic biological,,geo-microbiological laboratory.,In this cave, great areas are covered by,this reddish material that you see here,,and also these enormous crystals,of selenite that you can see dangling down.,This stuff is produced biologically.,This is the breakdown product of the bedrock,,that organisms are busy munching their way through.,They take iron and manganese minerals,within the bedrock and they oxidize them.,And every time they do that, they get a tiny little packet of energy.,And that tiny little packet of energy is what they use, then,,to run their life processes.,Interestingly enough, they also do this,with uranium and chromium, and various other toxic metals. 
 And so, the obvious avenue,for bio-remediation,comes from organisms like this.,These organisms we now bring into the lab,,and you can see some of them growing on Petri plates,,and get them to reproduce the precise biominerals,that we find on the walls of these caves.,So, these are signals that they leave in the rock record.,Well, even in basalt surfaces in lava-tube caves,,which are a by-product of volcanic activity,,we find these walls totally covered,,in many cases,,by these beautiful, glistening silver walls,,or shiny pink or shiny red or shiny gold.,And these are mineral deposits,that are also made by bacteria.,And you can see in these central images here,,scanning electron micrographs of some of these guys --,these are gardens of these bacteria. 
 One of the interesting things about these particular guys,is that they're in the actinomycete,and streptomycete groups of the bacteria,,which is where we get most of our antibiotics.,The sub-surface of Earth,contains a vast biodiversity.,And these organisms,,because they're very separate from the surface,,make a vast array of novel compounds.,And so, the potential for exploiting this,for pharmaceutical and industrial chemical uses,is completely untapped,,but probably exceeds most of the rest,of the biodiversity of the planet. 
 So, lava-tube caves--,I've just told you about organisms that live here on this planet.,We know that on Mars and the Moon,there are tons of these structures.,We can see them.,On the left you can see a lava tube forming,at a recent eruption -- Mount Etna in Sicily --,and this is the way these tubes form.,And when they hollow out,,then they become habitats for organisms.,These are all over the planet Mars,,and we're busy cataloguing them now.,And so, there's very interesting cave real estate,on Mars, at least of that type. 
 In order to access,these sub-surface environments that we're interested in,,we're very interested in developing the tools to do this.,You know, it's not easy to get into these caves.,It requires crawling, climbing,,rope-work, technical rope-work,and many other complex human motions,in order to access these.,We face the problem of, how can we do this robotically?,Why would we want to do it robotically?,Well, we're going to be sending,robotic missions to Mars,long in advance of human missions. 
 And then, secondly, getting back to that earlier point that I made,about the preciousness of any life that we may find,on Mars, we don't want to contaminate it.,And one of the best ways to study something without contaminating it,is to have an intermediary.,And in this case, we're imagining,intermediary robotic devices,that can actually do some of that,front-end work for us,,to protect any potential life that we find.,I'm not going to go through all of these projects now,,but we're involved in about half-a-dozen robotic development projects,,in collaboration with a number of different groups.,I want to talk specifically about the,array that you see on the top. 
 These are hopping microbot swarms.,I'm working on this with the Field and Space Robotics Laboratory,and my friend Steve Dubowsky at MIT,,and we have come up with the idea,of having little, jumping bean-like,robots,that are propelled by artificial muscle,,which is one of the Dubowsky Lab's specialties --,are the EPAMs, or artificial muscles.,And these allow them to hop.,They behave with,a swarm behavior,,where they relate to each other,,modeled after insect swarm behavior,,and they could be made very numerous.,And so, one can send a thousand of them,,as you can see in this upper left-hand picture,,a thousand of them could fit into the payload bay,that was used for one of the current MER Rovers.,And these little guys -- you could lose many of them.,If you send a thousand of them,,you could probably get rid of 90 percent of them and still have a mission.,And so, that allows you the flexibility,to go into very challenging terrain,and actually make your way where you want to go. 
 Now, to wrap this up, I want to talk for two seconds,about caves and the human expansion beyond Earth,as a natural outgrowth of the work that we do in caves.,It occurred to us a number of years ago,that caves have many properties,that people have used,and other organisms have used as habitat in the past.,And perhaps it's time we started to explore those,,in the context of future Mars and the Moon exploration. 
 So, we have just finished a NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts Phase II study,,looking at the irreducible set of technologies,that you would need in order to,actually allow people to inhabit lava tubes,on the Moon or Mars.,It turns out to be a fairly simple and small list,,and we have gone,in the relatively primitive technology direction.,So, we're talking about things like inflatable liners,that can conform to the complex topological shape,on the inside of a cave,,foamed-in-place airlocks to deal with this complex topology,,various ways of getting breathing gases,made from the intrinsic materials of these bodies.,And the future is there for us,to use these lava-tube caves on Mars.,And right now we're in caves, and we're doing science and recreation,,but I think in the future we'll be using them,for habitat and science on these other bodies. 
 Now, my view of what the current status,of potential life on Mars is,that it's probably been on the planet,,maybe one in two chances.,The question as to whether,there is life on Mars that is related to life on Earth,has now been very muddied,,because we now know,,from Mars meteorites that have made it to Earth,,that there's material that can be exchanged between those two planets. 
 One of the burning questions, of course, is,if we go there and find life in the sub-surface,,as I fully expect that we will,,is that a second genesis of life?,Did life start here,and was it transported there?,Did it start there and get transported here?,This will be a fascinating puzzle as we go into the next half-century,,and where I expect that we will,have more and more Mars missions to answer these questions.,Thank you.Mockingbirds are badass. 
 (Laughter),They are.,Mockingbirds -- that's Mimus polyglottos --,are the emcees of the animal kingdom. 
 They listen and mimic and remix what they like.,They rock the mic outside my window every morning.,I can hear them sing the sounds of the car alarms,like they were songs of spring.,I mean, if you can talk it, a mockingbird can squawk it.,So check it, I'm gonna to catch mockingbirds.,I'm going to trap mockingbirds all across the nation,and put them gently into mason jars like mockingbird Molotov cocktails. 
 (Laughter) 
 Yeah. And as I drive through a neighborhood,,say, where people got-a-lotta, I'll take a mockingbird I caught,in a neighborhood where folks ain't got nada and just let it go, you know.,Up goes the bird, out come the words, "Juanito, Juanito,,vente a comer mi hijo!",Oh, I'm going to be the Johnny Appleseed of sound. 
 (Laughter) 
 Cruising random city streets, rocking a drop-top Cadillac,with a big backseat, packing like 13 brown paper Walmart bags,full of loaded mockingbirds, and I'll get everybody. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'll get the nitwit on the network news saying,,"We'll be back in a moment with more on the crisis.",I'll get some asshole at a watering hole asking what brand the ice is.,I'll get that lady at the laundromat who always seems to know what being nice is.,I'll get your postman making dinner plans.,I'll get the last time you lied.,I'll get, "Baby, just give me the frickin' TV guide.",I'll get a lonely, little sentence with real error in it,,"Yeah, I guess I could come inside, but only for a minute." 
 (Laughter) 
 I'll get an ESL class in Chinatown learning "It's Raining, It's Pouring.",I'll put a mockingbird on a late-night train just to get an old man snoring.,I'll get your ex-lover telling someone else, "Good morning.",I'll get everyone's good mornings.,I don't care how you make 'em.,Aloha. Konichiwa. Shalom. Ah-Salam Alaikum.,Everybody means everybody, means everybody here.,And so maybe I'll build a gilded cage.,I'll line the bottom with old notebook pages.,Inside it, I will place a mockingbird for --,short explanation, hippie parents. 
 (Laughter) 
 What does a violin have to do with technology?,Where in the world is this world heading?,On one end, gold bars --,on the other, an entire planet.,We are 12 billion light years from the edge.,That's a guess.,Space is length and breadth continued indefinitely,,but you cannot buy a ticket to travel commercially to space in America,because countries are beginning to eat like us, live like us and die like us.,You might wanna avert your gaze, because that,is a newt about to regenerate its limb,,and shaking hands spreads more germs than kissing.,There's about 10 million phage per job.,It's a very strange world inside a nanotube.,Women can talk; black men ski; white men build strong buildings;,we build strong suns.,The surface of the Earth is absolutely riddled with holes,,and here we are, right in the middle. 
 (Laughter) 
 It is the voice of life that calls us to come and learn.,When all the little mockingbirds fly away,,they're going to sound like the last four days.,I will get uptown gurus, downtown teachers,,broke-ass artists and dealers, and Filipino preachers, leaf blowers,,bartenders, boob-job doctors, hooligans, garbage men,,your local Congressmen in the spotlight, guys in the overhead helicopters.,Everybody gets heard.,Everybody gets this one, honest mockingbird as a witness.,And I'm on this.,I'm on this 'til the whole thing spreads,,with chat rooms and copycats and moms maybe tucking kids into bed,singing, "Hush, little baby, don't say a word.,Wait for the man with the mockingbird." 
 (Laughter) 
 Yeah. And then come the news crews, and,the man-in-the-street interviews, and the letters to the editor.,Everybody asking, just who is responsible for this citywide,,nationwide mockingbird cacophony, and somebody finally is going to tip,the City Council of Monterey, California off to me,,and they'll offer me a key to the city.,A gold-plated, oversized key to the city,and that is all I need, 'cause if I get that, I can unlock the air.,I'll listen for what's missing, and I'll put it there.,Thank you, TED. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: Wow. 
 (Applause) 
 Wow. 
 (Applause)I was listed on the online biography,that said I was a design missionary.,That's a bit lofty; I'm really more,of something like a street walker.,I spend a lot of time in urban areas,looking for design,,and studying design in the public sector.,I take about 5,000 photographs a year,,and I thought that I would edit from these,,and try to come up with some images,that might be appropriate and interesting to you.,And I used three criteria:,the first was, I thought I'd talk about,real design within reach,,design that's free, not design not quite within reach,,as we're fondly known by our competition and competitors,,but stuff that you can find on the streets, stuff that was free,,stuff that was available to all people,,and stuff that probably contains some other important messages. 
 I'll use these sidewalks in Rio as an example.,A very common public design done in the '50s.,It's got a nice kind of flowing, organic form,,very consistent with the Brazilian culture --,I think good design adds to culture.,Wholly inconsistent with San Francisco or New York.,But I think these are my sort of information highways:,I live in much more of an analog world,,where pedestrian traffic and,interaction and diversity exchange,,and where I think the simple things under our feet,have a great amount of meaning to us. 
 How did I get started in this business?,I was a ceramic designer for about 10 years,,and just loved utilitarian form --,simple things that we use every day,,little compositions of color and surface on form.,This led me to starting a company called Design Within Reach,,a company dealing with simple forms,,making good designers available to us,,and also selling the personalities and character of the designers,as well, and it seems to have worked.,A couple of years into the process,,I spent a lot of time in Europe traveling around, looking for design. 
 And I had a bit of a wake-up call in Amsterdam:,I was there going into the design stores,,and mixing with our crowd of designers,,and I recognized that a whole lot of stuff,pretty much looked the same, and the effect of globalization,has had that in our community also.,We know a lot about what's going on with design around the world,,and it's getting increasingly more difficult,to find design that reflects a unique culture.,I was walking around on the streets of Amsterdam,and I recognized, you know, the big story,from Amsterdam isn't what's in the design stores,,it's what's out on the streets,,and maybe it's self-explanatory,,but a city that hasn't been taken over by modernism,,that's preserved its kind of architecture and character,,and where the bicycle plays an important part of the way,in which people get around and where pedestrian rights,are protected.,And I write a newsletter that goes out every week,,and I wrote an article about this, and it got such enormous response,that I realized that design, that common design,,that's in the public area means a lot to people,,and establishes kind of a groundwork and a dialog. 
 I then kind of thought about the other cities,in Europe where I spend a lot of time looking for design,,like Basel, where Vitra is located, or in northern Italy --,all cities where there are a whole lot of bicycles,,and where pedestrian areas -- and I came to the conclusion that perhaps,there was something about these important design centers,that dealt with bicycles and foot traffic,,and I'm sure the skeptic eye would say, no, the correlation there,is that there are universities and schools,where people can't afford cars,,but it did seem that in many of these areas,pedestrian traffic was protected.,You wouldn't look at this and call this a designer bike:,a designer bike is made of titanium or molybdenum.,But I began looking at design in a place like Amsterdam,and recognized, you know, the first job of design,is to serve a social purpose.,And so I look at this bike as not being a designer bike,,but being a very good example of design. 
 And since that time in Amsterdam, I spent an increasing amount of time,in the cities, looking at design,for common evidence of design,that really isn't under so much of a designer's signature.,I was in Buenos Aires very recently,,and I went to see this bridge by Santiago Calatrava.,He's a Spanish architect and designer.,And the tourist brochures pointed me in the direction of this bridge --,I love bridges, metaphorically and symbolically and structurally --,and it was a bit of a disappointment,,because of the sludge from the river was encrusted on it; it really wasn't in use.,And I recognized that oftentimes design,,when you're set up to see design,,it can be a bit of a letdown. 
 But there were lots of other things going on in this area:,it was a kind of construction zone;,a lot of buildings were going up.,And, approaching a building from a distance, you don't see too much;,you get a little closer, and you arrive at a nice little composition,that might remind you of a Mondrian or a Diebenkorn or something.,But to me it was an example of,industrial materials with a little bit of colors and animation,and a nice little still life -- kind of unintended piece of design.,And going a little closer, you get a different perspective.,I find these little vignettes,,these little accidental pieces of design,,to be refreshing.,They give me, I don't know,,a sense of correctness in the world,and some visual delight in the knowledge,that the building will probably never look as good,as this simple industrial scaffolding,that is there to serve. 
 Down the road, there was another building, a nice visual structure:,horizontal, vertical elements, little decorative lines,going across, these magenta squiggles,,the workmen being reduced to decorative elements,,just a nice, kind of, breakup,of the urban place.,And, you know, that no longer exists.,You've captured it for a moment, and finding this little still life's,like listening to little songs or something:,it gives me an enormous amount of pleasure.,Antoine Predock designed,a wonderful ball stadium in San Diego,called Petco Park.,A terrific use of local materials,,but inside you could find some interior compositions.,Some people go to baseball stadiums to look at games;,I go and see design relationships.,Just a wonderful kind of breakup of architecture,,and the way that the trees form vertical elements. 
 Red is a color in the landscape,that is often on stop signs.,It takes your attention; it has a great amount of emotion;,it stares back at you the way that a figure might.,Just a piece of barrier tape construction stuff in Italy.,Construction site in New York:,red having this kind of emotional power,that's almost an equivalent with the way in which --,cuteness of puppies and such.,Side street in Italy.,Red drew me into this little composition,,optimistic to me in the sense that maybe,the public service's mailbox,,door service, plumbing.,It looks as if these different public services,work together to create some nice little compositions.,In Italy, you know, almost everything, kind of, looks good.,Simple menus put on a board,,achieving, kind of, the sort of balance.,But I'm convinced that it's because,you're walking around the streets and seeing things.,Red can be comical: it can draw your attention,to the poor little personality of the little fire hydrant,suffering from bad civic planning in Havana.,Color can animate simple blocks,,simple materials:,walking in New York, I'll stop. 
 I don't always know why I take photographs of things.,A nice visual composition of symmetry.,Curves against sharp things.,It's a comment on the way in which we deal with,public seating in the city of New York.,I've come across some other just,,kind of, curious relationships,of bollards on the street that have different interpretations,,but -- these things amuse me.,Sometimes a trash can -- this is just in the street in San Francisco --,a trash can that's been left there for 18 months,creates a nice 45-degree angle,against these other relationships,,and turns a common parking spot into a nice little piece of sculpture.,So, there's this sort of silent hand of design at work,that I see in places that I go. 
 Havana is a wonderful area.,It's quite free of commercial clutter:,you don't see our logos and brands and names,,and therefore you're alert to things physically.,And this is a great protection of a pedestrian zone,,and the repurposing of some colonial cannons to do that.,And Cuba needs to be far more resourceful,,because of the blockades and things,,but a really wonderful playground. 
 I've often wondered why Italy is really a leader in modern design.,In our area, in furnishings,,they're sort of way at the top.,The Dutch are good also, but the Italians are good.,And I came across this little street in Venice,,where the communist headquarters,were sharing a wall with this Catholic shrine.,And I realized that, you know, Italy is a place,where they can accept these different ideologies,and deal with diversity and not have the problem,,or they can choose to ignore them,,but these -- you don't have warring factions,,and I think that maybe the tolerance of the absurdity,which has made Italy so innovative,and so tolerant.,The past and the present work quite well together in Italy also,,and I think that it's recognizable there,,and has an important effect on culture,,because their public spaces are protected,,their sidewalks are protected,,and you're actually able to confront these things,physically,,and I think this helps people get over,their fear of modernism and other such things. 
 A change might be a typical street corner in San Francisco.,And I use this -- this is, sort of,,what I consider to be urban spam.,I notice this stuff because I walk a lot,,but here, private industry is really kind of,making a mess of the public sector.,And as I look at it, I sort of say, you know,,the publications that report on problems in the urban area,also contribute to it,,and it's just my call to say to all of us,,public policy won't change this at all;,private industry has to work to take things like this seriously. 
 The extreme might be in Italy where, again,,there's kind of some type of control,over what's happening in the environment is very evident,,even in the way that they sell and distribute periodicals.,I walk to work every day or ride my scooter,,and I come down and park in this little spot.,And I came down one day,,and all the bikes were red.,Now, this is not going to impress you guys who Photoshop, and can do stuff,,but this was an actual moment,when I got off my bike,,and I looked and I thought, it's as if,all of my biker brethren,had kind of gotten together and conspired,to make a little statement.,And it reminded me that --,to keep in the present,,to look out for these kinds of things. 
 It gave me possibilities for wonder --,if maybe it's a yellow day in San Francisco, and we could all agree,,and create some installations.,But it also reminded me of the power,of pattern and repetition,to make an effect in our mind.,And I don't know if there's a stronger kind of effect,than pattern and the way it unites,kind of disparate elements.,I was at the art show in Miami in December,,and spent a couple of hours looking at fine art,,and amazed at the prices of art,and how expensive it is, but having a great time looking at it.,And I came outside, and the valets for this car service,had created, you know, quite a nice little collage,of these car keys,,and my closest equivalent were a group of prayer tags,that I had seen in Tokyo.,And I thought that if,pattern can unite these disparate elements,,it can do just about anything. 
 I don't have very many shots of people,,because they kind of nget in the way of studying pure form.,I was in a small restaurant in Spain,,having lunch --,one of those nice days where,you had the place kind of to yourself,,and you have a glass of wine, and enjoying the local area,and the culture and the food,and the quiet, and feeling very lucky,,and a bus load of tourists arrived,,emptied out,,filled up the restaurant.,In a very short period of time,,completely changed the atmosphere,and character with loud voices and large bodies and such,,and we had to get up and leave;,it was just that uncomfortable.,And at that moment, the sun came out,,and through this perforated screen,,a pattern was cast over these bodies,and they kind of faded into the rear,,and we left the restaurant kind of,feeling O.K. about stuff. 
 And I do think pattern,has the capability of eradicating,some of the most evil,forces of society,,such as bad form in restaurants,,but quite seriously, it was a statement to me,that one thing that you do, sort of, see,is the aggressive nature,of the industrial world has produced --,kind of,,large masses of things,,and when you -- in monoculture,,and I think the preservation of diversity in culture,is something that's important to us. 
 The last shots that I have deal with --,coming back to this theme of sidewalks,,and I wanted to,say something here about -- I'm, kind of, optimistic, you know.,Post-Second World War,,the influence of the automobile,has really been devastating in a lot of our cities.,A lot of urban areas have been converted into parking lots,in a sort of indiscriminate use.,A lot of the planning departments became subordinated,to the transportation department. It's as easy to rag on cars,as it is on Wal-Mart;,I'm not going to do that.,But they're real examples in urbanization,and the change that's occurred in the last number of years,,and the heightened sensitivity to the importance,of our urban environments as cultural centers.,I think that they are, that the statements that we make,in this public sector,are our contributions,to a larger whole. 
 Cities are the place where we're most likely,to encounter diversity,and to mix with other people.,We go there for stimulation in art and all those other things.,But I think people have recognized,the sanctity of our urban areas.,A place like Chicago,has really reached kind of a level of international stature.,The U.S. is actually becoming a bit of a leader in kind of,enlightened urban planning and renewal,,and I want to single out a place like Chicago,,where I look at some guy like Mayor Daley as a bit of a design hero,for being able to work through the,political processes and all that to improve an area.,You would expect a city like this to have,upgraded flower boxes,on Michigan Avenue where wealthy people shop,,but if you actually go along the street you find,the flower boxes change from street to street:,there's actual diversity in the plants.,And the idea that a city group can maintain,different types of foliage,is really quite exceptional. 
 There are common elements of this that you'll see throughout Chicago,,and then there are your big-D design statements:,the Pritzker Pavilion done by Frank Gehry.,My measure of this as being an important bit of design,is not so much the way that it looks,,but the fact that it performs a very important social function.,There are a lot of free concerts, for example,,that go on in this area;,it has a phenomenal acoustic system.,But the commitment that the city has made to the public area,is significant, and almost an international model.,I work on the mayor's council in San Francisco,,on the International Design Council for Mayors,,and Chicago is looked at as the pinnacle,,and I really would like to salute Mayor Daley and the folks there.,I thought that I should include at least one,shot of technology for you guys.,This is also in Millennium Park in Chicago,,where the Spanish artist-designer Plensa,has created, kind of,,a digital readout in this park,that reflects back,the characters and personalities,of the people in this area.,And it's a welcoming area, I think, inclusive of diversity,,reflective of diversity, and I think,this marriage of both technology and art,in the public sector is an area where the U.S.,can really take a leadership role,,and Chicago is one example. 
 Thank you very much.I've got apparently 18 minutes,to convince you that history has a direction, an arrow;,that in some fundamental sense, it's good;,that the arrow points to something positive.,Now, when the TED people first approached me about giving this upbeat talk --,(Laughter),-- that was before the cartoon of Muhammad had triggered global rioting.,It was before the avian flu had reached Europe.,It was before Hamas had won the Palestinian election,,eliciting various counter-measures by Israel.,And to be honest, if I had known when I was asked to give this upbeat talk,that even as I was giving the upbeat talk,,the apocalypse would be unfolding --,(Laughter),-- I might have said, "Is it okay if I talk about something else?",But I didn't, OK. So we're here. I'll do what I can. I'll do what I can. 
 I've got to warn you:,the sense in which my worldview is upbeat has always been kind of subtle,,sometimes even elusive.,(Laughter),The sense in which I can be uplifting and inspiring --,I mean, there's always been a kind of a certain grim dimension,to the way I try to uplift, so if grim inspiration --,(Laughter),-- if grim inspiration is not a contradiction in terms, that is, I'm afraid,,the most you can hope for. OK, today -- that's if I succeed.,I'll see what I can do. OK? 
 Now, in one sense,,the claim that history has a direction is not that controversial.,If you're just talking about social structure,,OK, clearly that's gotten more complex,a little over the last 10,000 years -- has reached higher and higher levels.,And in fact, that's actually sustaining,a long-standing trend that predates human beings, OK,,that biological evolution was doing for us.,Because what happened in the beginning, this stuff encases itself in a cell,,then cells start hanging out together in societies.,Eventually they get so close, they form multicellular organisms,,then you get complex multicellular organisms; they form societies. 
 But then at some point, one of these multicellular organisms,does something completely amazing with this stuff, which is,it launches a whole second kind of evolution: cultural evolution.,And amazingly, that evolution sustains the trajectory,that biological evolution had established toward greater complexity.,By cultural evolution we mean the evolution of ideas.,A lot of you have heard the term "memes." The evolution of technology,,I pay a lot of attention to, so, you know,,one of the first things you got was a little hand axe.,Generations go by, somebody says, hey, why don't we put it on a stick?,(Laughter),Just absolutely delights the little ones.,Next best thing to a video game. 
 This may not seem to impress,,but technological evolution is progressive, so another 10, 20,000 years,,and armaments technology takes you here.,(Laughter),Impressive. And the rate of technological evolution speeds up,,so a mere quarter of a century after this, you get this, OK.,(Laughter),And this.,(Laughter),I'm sorry -- it was a cheap laugh, but I wanted to find a way,to transition back to this idea of the unfolding apocalypse,,and I thought that might do it.,(Applause) 
 So, what threatens to happen with this unfolding apocalypse,is the collapse of global social organization.,Now, first let me remind you how much work it took to get us where we are,,to be on the brink of true global social organization.,Originally, you had the most complex societies, the hunter-gatherer village.,Stonehenge is the remnant of a chiefdom,,which is what you get with the invention of agriculture: multi-village polity,with centralized rule.,With the invention of writing, you start getting cities. This is blurry. I kind of like that,because it makes it look like a one-celled organism and reminds you,how many levels organic organization has already moved through,to get to this point. And then you get to, you know, you get empires. 
 I want to stress, you know, social organization can transcend political bounds.,This is the Silk Road connecting the Chinese Empire and the Roman Empire.,So you had social complexity spanning the whole continent,,even if no polity did similarly. Today, you've got nation states.,Point is: there's obviously collaboration and organization going on,beyond national bounds.,This is actually just a picture of the earth at night,,and I'm just putting it up because I think it's pretty.,Does kind of convey the sense that this is an integrated system. 
 Now, I explained this growth of complexity by reference to something,called "non-zero sumness.",Assuming that a few of you did not do the assigned reading, very quickly,,the key idea is the distinction between zero-sum games, in which correlations,are inverse: always a winner and a loser.,Non-zero-sum games in which correlations can be positive, OK.,So like in tennis, usually it's win-lose;,it always adds up to zero-zero-sum. But if you're playing doubles,,the person on your side of the net, they're in the same boat as you,,so you're playing a non-zero-sum game with them.,It's either for the better or for the worse, OK.,A lot of forms of non-zero-sum behavior in the realm of economics and so on,in everyday life often leads to cooperation. 
 The argument I make is basically that, well,,non-zero-sum games have always been part of life.,You have them in hunter-gatherer societies,,but then through technological evolution, new forms of technology arise,that facilitate or encourage the playing of non-zero-sum games,,involving more people over larger territory.,Social structure adapts to accommodate this possibility and,to harness this productive potential, so you get cities, you know,,and you get all the non-zero-sum games you don't think about,that are being played across the world.,Like, have you ever thought when you buy a car,,how many people on how many different continents contributed,to the manufacture of that car? Those are people in effect,you're playing a non-zero-sum game with.,I mean, there are certainly plenty of them around. 
 Now, this sounds like an intrinsically upbeat worldview in a way,,because when you think of non-zero, you think win-win, you know,,that's good. Well, there are a few reasons,that actually it's not intrinsically upbeat.,First of all, it can accommodate; it doesn't deny the existence,of inequality exploitation war.,But there's a more fundamental reason,that it's not intrinsically upbeat, because a non-zero-sum game,,all it tells you for sure is that the fortunes will be correlated for better or worse.,It doesn't necessarily predict a win-win outcome. 
 So, in a way, the question is: on what grounds,am I upbeat at all about history? And the answer is,,first of all, on balance I would say people have played their games,to more win-win outcomes than lose-lose outcomes. On balance,,I think history is a net positive in the non-zero-sum game department.,And a testament to this is the thing that most amazes me,,most impresses me, and most uplifts me,,which is that there is a moral dimension to history;,there is a moral arrow. We have seen moral progress over time. 
 2,500 years ago, members of one Greek city-state,considered members of another Greek city-state subhuman,and treated them that way. And then this moral revolution arrived,,and they decided that actually, no, Greeks are human beings.,It's just the Persians who aren't fully human,and don't deserve to be treated very nicely. 
 But this was progress -- you know, give them credit. And now today,,we've seen more progress. I think -- I hope -- most people here would say,that all people everywhere are human beings,,deserve to be treated decently,,unless they do something horrendous, regardless of race or religion.,And you have to read your ancient history to realize what a revolution that has been,,OK. This was not a prevalent view,,few thousand years ago, and I attribute it to this non-zero-sum dynamic.,I think that's the reason there is as much tolerance toward nationalities,,ethnicities, religions as there is today. If you asked me,,you know, why am I not in favor of bombing Japan,,well, I'm only half-joking when I say they built my car.,We have this non-zero-sum relationship,,and I think that does lead to a kind of a tolerance to the extent that you realize,that someone else's welfare is positively correlated with yours --,you're more likely to cut them a break. 
 I kind of think this is a kind of a business-class morality.,Unfortunately, I don't fly trans-Atlantic business class often enough,to know, or any other kind of business class really,,but I assume that in business class, you don't hear many expressions of, you know,,bigotry about racial groups or ethnic groups,,because the people who are flying trans-Atlantic business class,are doing business with all these people; they're making money,off all these people. And I really do think that, in that sense at least,,capitalism has been a constructive force,,and more fundamentally, it's a non-zero-sumness,that has been a constructive force in expanding people's realm,of moral awareness. I think the non-zero-sum dynamic,,which is not only economic by any means -- it's not always commerce --,but it has driven us to the verge of a moral truth,,which is the fundamental equality of everyone. It has done that.,As it has moved global, moved us toward a global level of social organization,,it has driven us toward moral truth.,I think that's wonderful. 
 Now, back to the unfolding apocalypse.,And you may wonder, OK, that's all fine,,sounds great -- moral direction in history --,but what about this so-called clash of civilizations? Well, first of all,,I would emphasize that it fits into the non-zero-sum framework,,OK. If you look at the relationship,between the so-called Muslim world and Western world --,two terms I don't like, but can't really avoid;,in such a short span of time, they're efficient if nothing else --,it is non-zero-sum. And by that I mean,,if people in the Muslim world get more hateful, more resentful,,less happy with their place in the world,,it'll be bad for the West. If they get more happy, it'll be good for the West.,So that is a non-zero-sum dynamic. 
 And I would say the non-zero-sum dynamic is only going to grow more intense over time,because of technological trends, but more intense in a kind of negative way.,It's the downside correlation of their fortunes that will become more and more possible.,And one reason is because of something I call the "growing lethality of hatred.",More and more, it's possible for grassroots hatred abroad,to manifest itself in the form of organized violence on American soil.,And that's pretty new, and I think it's probably going to get a lot worse,-- this capacity -- because of,trends in information technology, in technologies that can be used,for purposes of munitions like biotechnology and nanotechnology.,We may be hearing more about that today. 
 And there's something I worry about especially, which is that,this dynamic will lead to a kind of a feedback cycle that puts us on a slippery slope.,What I have in mind is: terrorism happens here; we overreact to it.,That, you know, we're not sufficiently surgical in our retaliation,leads to more hatred abroad, more terrorism.,We overreact because being human, we feel like retaliating,,and it gets worse and worse and worse.,You could call this the positive feedback of negative vibes,,but I think in something so spooky,,we really shouldn't have the word positive there at all, even in a technical sense.,So let's call it the death spiral of negativity.,(Laughter),I assure you if it happens, at the end, both the West,and the Muslim world will have suffered. 
 So, what do we do? Well, first of all, we can do a lot more with arms control,,the international regulation of dangerous technologies.,I have a whole global governance sermon,that I will spare you right now,,because I don't think that's going to be enough anyway, although it's essential.,I think we're going to have to have a major round,of moral progress in the world.,I think you're just going to have to see less hatred among groups,,less bigotry, and, you know, racial groups, religious groups, whatever.,I've got to admit I feel silly saying that.,It sounds so kind of Pollyannaish. I feel like Rodney King, you know,,saying, why can't we all just get along?,But hey, I don't really see any alternative, given the way I read the situation.,There's going to have to be moral progress.,There's going to have to be a lessening of the amount of hatred in the world,,given how dangerous it's becoming.,In my defense, I'd say, as naive as this may sound,,it's ultimately grounded in cynicism. 
 That is to say --,(Laughter),-- thank you, thank you. That is to say, remember: my whole view,of morality is that it boils down to self-interest.,It's when people's fortunes are correlated.,It's when your welfare conduces to mine, that I decide, oh yeah,,I'm all in favor of your welfare. That's what's responsible,for this growth of this moral progress so far,,and I'm saying we once again have a correlation of fortunes,,and if people respond to it intelligently, we will see,the development of tolerance and so on --,the norms that we need, you know.,We will see the further evolution of this kind of business-class morality. 
 So, these two things, you know, if they get people's attention,and drive home the positive correlation and people do what's in their self-interests,,which is further the moral evolution,,then they could actually have a constructive effect.,And that's why I lump growing lethality of hatred,and death spiral of negativity under the general rubric,,reasons to be cheerful.,(Laughter),Doing the best I can, OK.,(Laughter),I never called myself Mr. Uplift.,I'm just doing what I can here.,(Laughter) 
 Now, launching a moral revolution has got to be hard, right?,I mean, what do you do?,And I think the answer is a lot of different people,are going to have to do a lot of different things.,We all start where we are. Speaking as an American,who has children whose security 10, 20, 30 years down the road,I worry about -- what I personally want to start out doing,is figuring out why so many people around the world hate us, OK.,I think that's a worthy research project myself.,I also like it because it's an intrinsically kind of morally redeeming exercise.,Because to understand why somebody,in a very different culture does something --,somebody you're kind of viewing as alien,,who's doing things you consider strange,in a culture you consider strange -- to really understand why they do,the things they do is a morally redeeming accomplishment,,because you've got to relate their experience to yours.,To really understand it, you've got to say, "Oh, I get it.,So when they feel resentful, it's kind of like,the way I feel resentful when this happens,,and for somewhat the same reasons." That's true understanding.,And I think that is an expansion of your moral compass when you manage to do that. 
 It's especially hard to do when people hate you, OK,,because you don't really, in a sense, want,to completely understand why people hate you.,I mean, you want to hear the reason, but you don't want to be able to relate to it.,You don't want it to make sense, right? (Laughter),You don't want to say, "Well, yeah, I can kind of understand,how a human being in those circumstances,would hate the country I live in." That's not a pleasant thing,,but I think it's something that we're going to have to get used to and 
 work on. Now, I want to stress that to understand, you know --,there are people who don't like this whole business of understanding,the grassroots, the root causes of things; they don't want to know,why people hate us. I want to understand it.,The reason you're trying to understand why they hate us,,is to get them to quit hating us. The idea,when you go through this moral exercise of really coming to appreciate,their humanity and better understand them, is part of an effort,to get them to appreciate your humanity in the long run.,I think it's the first step toward that. That's the long-term goal. 
 There are people who worry about this, and in fact,,I, myself, apparently, was denounced on national TV,a couple of nights ago because of an op-ed I'd written.,It was kind of along these lines, and the allegation was,that I have, quote, "affection for terrorists.",Now, the good news is that the person who said it was Ann Coulter.,(Laughter),(Applause),I mean, if you've got to have an enemy, do make it Ann Coulter.,(Laughter),But it's not a crazy concern, OK, because understanding behavior,can lead to a kind of empathy,,and it can make it a little harder to deliver tough love, and so on.,But I think we're a lot closer to erring on the side of not comprehending,the situation clearly enough, than in comprehending it so clearly,that we just can't, you know, get the army out to kill terrorists. 
 So I'm not really worried about it. So --,(Laughter),-- I mean, we're going to have to work on a lot of fronts,,but if we succeed -- if we succeed -- then once again,,non-zero-sumness and the recognition of non-zero-sum dynamics,will have forced us to a higher moral level.,And a kind of saving higher moral level,,something that kind of literally saves the world.,If you look at the word "salvation" in the Bible --,the Christian usage that we're familiar with --,saving souls, that people go to heaven -- that's actually a latecomer.,The original meaning of the word "salvation" in the Bible is about saving the social system.,"Yahweh is our Savior" means "He has saved the nation of Israel,",which at the time, was a pretty high-level social organization. 
 Now, social organization has reached the global level, and I guess,,if there's good news I can say I'm bringing you, it's just that,all the salvation of the world requires is the intelligent pursuit,of self-interests in a disciplined and careful way.,It's going to be hard. I say we give it a shot anyway,because we've just come too far to screw it up now.,Thanks.,(Applause)Basically, there's a major demographic event going on.,And it may be that passing the 50 percent urban point,is an economic tipping point. So the world now is a map of connectivity. 
 It used to be that Paris and London and New York were the largest cities.,What we have now is the end of the rise of the West. That's over.,The aggregate numbers are overwhelming.,So what's really going on? Well, villages of the world are emptying out. 
 The question is, why?,And here's the unromantic truth -- and the city air makes you free,,they said in Renaissance Germany. So some people go to places,like Shanghai but most go to the squatter cities where aesthetics rule.,And these are not really a people oppressed by poverty.,They're people getting out of poverty as fast as they can.,They're the dominant builders and to a large extent, the dominant designers.,They have home-brewed infrastructure and vibrant urban life. 
 One-sixth of the GDP in India is coming out of Mumbai.,They are constantly upgrading, and in a few cases, the government helps.,Education is the main event that can happen in cities.,What's going on in the street in Mumbai?,Al Gore knows. It's basically everything.,There's no unemployment in squatter cities. Everyone works.,One-sixth of humanity is there. It's soon going to be more than that. 
 So here's the first punch line:,cities have defused the population bomb. 
 And here's the second punch line.,That's the news from downtown. Here it is in perspective.,Stars have shined down on earth's life for billions of years.,Now we're shining right back up. 
 Thank you.I just want to say, over the last few years I've been --,had the opportunity to do this closing conference.,And I've had some incredible warm-up acts.,About eight years ago,,Billy Graham opened for me.,And I thought that there was -- 
 (Laughter) 
 I thought that there was absolutely no way,in hell to top that.,But I just wanted to say --,and I mean this without irony --,I think I can speak for everybody in the audience,when I say that I wish to God that you were the President of the United States. 
 (Applause) 
 OK, this is the title of my talk today. 
 (Laughter) 
 I just want to give you a quick overview.,First of all, please remember I'm completely politically correct,,and I mean everything with great affection.,If any of you have sensitive stomachs or are feeling queasy,,now is the time to check your Blackberry. 
 (Laughter) 
 Just to review, this is my TEDTalk.,We're going to do some jokes,,some gags,,some little skits --,and then we're going to talk about the L1 point. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, one of the questions I ask myself,is, was this the most distressing TED ever?,Let's try and sum things up, shall we?,Images of limb regeneration,and faces filled with smallpox:,21 percent of the conference. 
 (Laughter) 
 Mentions of polar bears drowning: four percent.,Images of the earth being wiped out by flood or bird flu: 64 percent. 
 (Laughter) 
 And David Pogue singing show tunes. 
 (Applause) 
 Because this is the most distressing TED ever,,I've been working with Neil Gershenfeld on next year's TED Bag.,And if the -- if the conference is anywhere near this distressing,,then we're going to have a scream bag next year. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's going to be a cradle-to-cradle scream bag, of course. 
 (Laughter) 
 So you're going to be able to go like this. 
 (Laughter) 
 Bring it over here,and open it up. Aaaah! 
 (Laughter) 
 Meanwhile, back at TED University,,this wonderful woman is teaching you how to chop Sun Chips. 
 (Laughter),So Robert Wright -- I don't know, 
 I felt like if there was anyone that Helen needed to give antidepressants to,,it might have been him.,I want to deliberately interfere with his dopamine levels. 
 (Laughter) 
 He was talking about morality.,Economy class morality is,,we want to bomb you back to the Stone Age.,Business class morality is,,don't bomb Japan -- they built my car.,And first-class morality is, don't bomb Mexico -- they clean my house. 
 (Laughter) 
 Yes, it is politically incorrect.,All right,,now I want to do a little bit of a thing for you ... 
 (Laughter) 
 All right, now these are the wha --,I'd say, [mumble, mumble --,mumble, mumble, mumble, mumble,,mumble] -- ahh! 
 (Laughter) 
 So I wanted to show you guys --,I wanted to talk about a revolutionary new computer interface,that lets you work with images just as easily,as you -- as a completely natural user interface. 
 (Laughter) 
 And you can --,you can use really natural hand gestures,to like, go like this. 
 (Applause) 
 Now we had a Harvard professor here --,she was from Harvard, I just wanted to mention and --,and she was actually a professor from Harvard.,And she was talking about seven-dimensional, inverted universes.,With, you know, of course, there's the gravity brain.,There's the weak brain. And then there's my weak brain,,which is too -- too -- absolutely too weak to understand,what the fuck she was talking about. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now -- 
 (Laughter) 
 one of the things that is very important to me,is to try and figure out what on Earth am I here for.,And that's why I went out,and I picked up a best-selling business book.,You know, it basically uses as its central premise Greek mythology.,And it's by a guy named Pastor Rick Warren,,and it's called,"The Porpoise Driven Life." 
 (Laughter) 
 And Rick is as,a pagan god,,which I thought was kind of appropriate,,in a certain way.,And now we're going to have kind of,a little more visualization about Rick Warren.,OK. 
 (Laughter) 
 All right.,Now, red is Rick Warren,,and green is Daniel Dennett, OK? 
 (Laughter) 
 The scales here are religiosity from zero percent,,or atheist, to 100 percent, Bible literally true.,And then this is books sold -- the logarithmic scale. 
 (Laughter) 
 30,000, 300,000, three million, 30 million, 300 million.,OK, now they're duking it out. Now they're duking it out. 
 (Laughter) 
 And Rick Warren's kind of pulling ahead, kind of pulling ahead.,Yup, and his installed base is getting a little bigger. 
 (Laughter) 
 But Darwin's dangerous idea is coming back. It's coming back.,Let me turn the trails on, so you can see that a little bit better. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Now, one of the things that's very important is,,Nicholas Negroponte talked to us about one lap dance per --,I'm sorry -- 
 (Laughter) 
 about One Laptop Per Child.,Now let's talk about some of the characteristics,that are important for this revolutionary device.,I'll tell you a little bit about the design parameters,,and then I'll show it to you in person.,First of all, it needs to be small.,It needs to be flat, so it's transportable.,Lightweight. Portable.,Uses very, very little power.,Very, very high resolution.,Has to be visible in bright daylight. Will work anywhere.,And broadly applicable across many platforms. 
 Now, we've actually done some research --,Neil Gershenfeld and the Fab Labs went out into the market.,They did some research; we came back; and we think we have the perfect prototype,of what the students in the field are actually asking for.,And here it is,,the $100 computer. 
 (Laughter) 
 OK, OK, OK, OK -- excellent, excellent.,Now, I bought this device from Clifford Stoll for about 900 bucks.,And he and his team of junior-high school students,were doing real science.,So we're trying to check and trying to douse here,,and see who uses marijuana. 
 (Laughter) 
 See who uses marijuana.,Are we going to be able to find any marijuana, Jim Young?,Only if we open enough locker doors. 
 (Laughter) 
 OK, now smallpox is an extremely distressing illness.,We had Dr. Larry Brilliant talking about how we eradicated smallpox.,I wanted to show you the stages of smallpox.,We start. This is day one. 
 (Laughter) 
 Day two.,Day three, she gets a massively big pox on her shoulder.,Day three.,Day four. 
 (Laughter) 
 Day five,and day six. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now the good news is, because I'm a trained medical professional,,I know that even though she'll be scarred for life,,she's going to make a full recovery. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now the good news about Architects for Humanity,is they're really kind of the most amazing group.,They've been sponsoring a design competition,to come up with innovative medical housing solutions,,clinic solutions, in Africa,,and they've had a design competition.,Now the wonderful thing is, Larry Brilliant was just appointed,the head of the Google Foundation,,and so he decided that he would support --,he would support Cameron's work.,And the way he decided to support that work,was by shipping over 50,000 shipping containers,of Google snacks. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I want to show you some prototypes.,The U.N. -- you know, they took 20 years just to add a flap to a tent,,but I think we have some more exciting things.,This is a home made entirely out of Fruit Roll-Ups. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 And those roll-up cookies coated with white chocolate.,And the really wonderful thing about this is,,when you're done, well --,you can eat it.,But the thing that I'm really, really excited about,is this incredible granola house. 
 (Laughter) 
 And the granola house has a special Sun Chip roof,to collect water and recycle it.,And it's -- well, on this side it has regular Sour Patch Kids,and Gummy Bears to let in the light. 
 (Laughter) 
 But on this side, it has sugary Gummy Bears,,to diffuse the light more slightly.,And we -- we wanted just to show you what this might look like in situ. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 So, Einstein --,Einstein, tell me --,what's your favorite song?,No, I said what's your favorite song?,No, I said what's your favorite song?,"Free Bird." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 OK, so, Einstein,,what's your favorite singing group?,Could you say that again? What's your favorite singing group?,OK, one more time -- I'm just going to give you a little help.,Your favorite singing group -- it's Diana Ross and the -- 
 Audience: Supremes! 
 Tom Reilly: Exactly. 
 (Applause) 
 Could we have the sound up on the laptop, please? 
 (Laughter) 
 "Free Bird" kind of reminds me that if you --,if you listen to "Free Bird" backwards,,this is what you might hear. 
 Computer: Satan. Satan. Satan. Satan.,Satan. Satan. Satan.,TR: Now it's a little hard to hear the whole message, so I wanted to -- 
 (Laughter) 
 so I wanted to help you a little bit. 
 Computer: My sweet Satan. Dan Dennett worships Satan.,Buy "The Purpose-Driven Life," or Satan will take your soul. 
 (Laughter) 
 TR: So,,we've talked a lot about global warming,,but, you know, as Jill said, it sounds kind of nice --,good weather in the wintertime, and New York City.,And as Jay Walker pointed out, that is just not scary enough.,So Al, I actually think I'm rather good at branding.,So I've tried to figure out a good design process,to come up with a new term to replace "global warming." 
 So we started with Babel Fish. We put in global warming.,And then we decided that we'd change it from English to Dutch --,into "Het globale Verwarmen.",From Dutch to [Korean], into "Hordahordaneecheewa." 
 (Laughter) 
 [Korean] to Portuguese: Aquecer-se Global.,Then Portuguese to Pig Latin. 
 (Laughter) 
 Aquecer-se ucked-fay.,And then finally back into the English,,which is, we're totally fucked. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Now I don't know about you,,but Michael Shermer talked about the willingness for human beings --,evolutionarily, they're designed to see patterns in things.,For example, in cheese sandwiches.,Now can you look at that carefully and see if you see the Virgin Mary?,I tried to make it a little bit clearer. 
 (Laughter) 
 Is it the Virgin Mary?,Or is it Mena Trott? 
 So, I talked to Josh Prince-Ramus about the convention center,and the conferences. It's getting awfully big.,It's getting just a little bit too big. It's bursting at the seams here a little bit.,So we tried to come up with a program --,how we could remake this structure to better accommodate TED.,So first of all we decided -- 
 (Laughter) 
 that we needed about one-third bookstore,,one-third Google cafe,,about 20 percent registration, 80 percent luxury hotel,,about five percent for restrooms.,And then of course, we wanted to have the simulcast lounge,,the lobby and the Steinbeck forum. 
 Now let me show you how that,literally translated into the design program.,So first,,one of the problems with Monterey is that if there is global warming,and Greenland melts as you say, the ocean level,is going to rise 20 feet and flood the hell out of the convention center.,So we're going to build this new building on stilts.,So we build this building on stilts,,then up here -- 
 (Laughter) 
 is where we're going to put the new Steinbeck auditorium. 
 (Laughter) 
 And the wonderful thing about the new bookstore is,,it's going to be shaped in a spiral that's organized by the Dewey Decimal System. 
 (Laughter) 
 Then we're going to make an escalator that helps you get up there.,And finally, we're going to put the Marriott Hotel,and the Portola Plaza on the top. 
 (Applause) 
 Now I don't know about you, but sometimes I have these images in my head,of separated at birth.,I don't know about you, but when I see Aubrey de Grey,,I immediately go to Gandalf the Grey. 
 (Laughter) 
 OK. Now, we've heard, of course,,that we're all soldiers here.,So what I'd really, really like you to do now is,,pick up your white piece of paper. Does everybody have their white piece of paper?,And I want you to get out a pen,,and I want you to write a terrorist note. 
 (Laughter) 
 If we put up the ELMO for a moment --,if we put up the ELMO, then we'll get, you know,,I'll give you a model that you can work from, OK? 
 (Laughter) 
 And then I want you to fold that note into a paper airplane.,And once you've folded it into a paper airplane,,I want you to take some anthrax -- 
 (Laughter) 
 and I want you to put that in the paper airplane.,And then I want you to throw it on Jim Young. 
 (Laughter) 
 Luckily, I was the recipient of the TED Prize this year.,And I wanted to see --,I want to dedicate this film to my father, Homer.,OK. 
 Now this film isn't really hard enough,,so I wanted to make it a little bit harder.,So I'm going to try and do this while reciting pi. 
 (Laughter) 
 3.1415,,2657,,753,,8567,,24972 --,-- 85871, 25871,,3928, 5657,,2592, 5624. 
 (Applause) 
 Can we cue the music please? 
 (Applause) 
 Now I wanted to use this talk to talk about global warming a little bit.,Back in 1968,,you can see that the mountain range of Brokeback Mountain,was covered in 151 inches of snow pack.,Parenthetically, over there on the slopes,,I did want to show you that black men ski. 
 (Laughter) 
 But over the years,,10 years later, the snow packs eroded,,and, if you notice, the trees have started turning yellow.,The water level of the lake has started drying up.,A few years later, there's no snow left at all.,And all the trees have turned brown.,This year, unfortunately the lakebed's,turned into an absolute cracked dry bed.,And I fear, if we do nothing for our planet,,in 20 years, it's going to look like this. 
 (Laughter) 
 Mr. Vice President, I wish I knew how to quit you. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Thank you. I have to tell younI'm both challenged and excited.,My excitement is: I get a chancento give something back.,My challenge is: the shortest seminarnI usually do is 50 hours. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm not exaggerating. I do weekends --,I do more, obviously,nI also coach people --,but I'm into immersion,nbecause how did you learn language?,Not just by learning principles,,you got in it and you did itnso often that it became real. 
 The bottom line of why I'm here,nbesides being a crazy mofo, is that --,I'm not here to motivate you,nyou don't need that, obviously.,Often that's what people think I do,,and it's the furthest thing from it.,What happens, though, is people say to me,,"I don't need any motivation.",But that's not what I do.,I'm the "why" guy.,I want to know why you do what you do. 
 What is your motive for action?,What is it that drives younin your life today? Not 10 years ago.,Are you running the same pattern?,Because I believe that the invisible forcenof internal drive, activated,,is the most important thing.,I'm here because I believenemotion is the force of life.,All of us here have great minds.,Most of us here have great minds, right?,We all know how to think.,With our minds we cannrationalize anything.,We can make anything happen. 
 I agree with what was describedna few days ago,,that people work in their self-interest.,But we know that that's bullshit at times.,You don't work in yournself-interest all the time,,because when emotion comes into it,,the wiring changesnin the way it functions.,So it's wonderful to think intellectuallynabout how the life of the world is,,especially those who are very smartncan play this game in our head.,But I really want to knownwhat's driving you. 
 What I would like to invite you to do,by the end of this talk is explorenwhere you are today, for two reasons.,One: so that you can contribute more.,And two: that hopefully we can not justnunderstand other people more,,but appreciate them more,nand create the kinds of connections,that can stop some of the challengesnthat we face today.,They're only going to get magnifiednby the very technology that connects us,,because it's making us intersect.,That intersectionndoesn't always create a view,of "everybody now understands everybody,,and everybody appreciates everybody." 
 I've had an obsessionnbasically for 30 years,,"What makes the differencenin the quality of people's lives?,What in their performance?",I got hired to produce the result now.,I've done it for 30 years.,I get the phone call,when the athlete is burning downnon national television,,and they were ahead by five strokes,and now they can't get back on the course.,I've got to do something right nownor nothing matters.,I get the phone call when the childnis going to commit suicide,,I've got to do something.,In 29 years, I'm very gratefulnto tell you I've never lost one.,It doesn't mean I won't some day,nbut I haven't yet.,The reason is an understandingnof these human needs. 
 When I get those callsnabout performance, that's one thing.,How do you make a change?,I'm also looking to see what is shapingnthe person's ability to contribute,,to do something beyond themselves.,Maybe the real question is,,I look at life and saynthere's two master lessons.,One is: there's the sciencenof achievement,,which almost everyone herenhas mastered amazingly.,"How do you take the invisiblenand make it visible,",How do you make your dreams happen?,Your business, your contributionnto society, money --,whatever, your body, your family. 
 The other lesson that is rarelynmastered is the art of fulfillment.,Because science is easy, right?,We know the rules, you write the codenand you get the results.,Once you know the game,nyou just up the ante, don't you?,But when it comesnto fulfillment -- that's an art.,The reason is, it's aboutnappreciation and contribution.,You can only feel so much by yourself. 
 I've had an interesting laboratorynto try to answer the real question,how somebody's life changes,if you look at them like those peoplenthat you've given everything to?,Like all the resources they say they need.,You gave not a 100-dollar computer,nbut the best computer.,You gave them love, joy,nwere there to comfort them.,Those people very often --nyou know some of them --,end up the rest of their life,with all this love, education,nmoney and background,going in and out of rehab.,Some people have beennthrough ultimate pain,,psychologically, sexually,nspiritually, emotionally abused --,and not always, but often,,they become some of the peoplenthat contribute the most to society. 
 The question we've got to asknourselves really is, what is it?,What is it that shapes us?,We live in a therapy culture.,Most of us don't do that,nbut the culture's a therapy culture,,the mindset that we are our past.,And you wouldn't be in this roomnif you bought that,,but most of societynthinks biography is destiny.,The past equals the future.,Of course it does if you live there.,But what we know and whatnwe have to remind ourselves --,because you can knownsomething intellectually,and then not use it, not apply it. 
 We've got to remind ourselvesnthat decision is the ultimate power.,When you ask people,,have you failed to achievensomething significant in your life? 
 Say, "Aye." Audience: Aye. 
 TR: Thanks for the interactionnon a high level there.,But if you ask people,nwhy didn't you achieve something?,Somebody who's working for you,nor a partner, or even yourself.,When you fail to achieve,nwhat's the reason people say?,What do they tell you?,Didn't have the knowledge,ndidn't have the money,,didn't have the time,ndidn't have the technology.,I didn't have the right manager. 
 Al Gore: Supreme Court.nTR: The Supreme Court. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) (Cheering) 
 (Applause continues) 
 TR: And -- 
 (Applause) 
 What do all those, includingnthe Supreme Court, have in common? 
 (Laughter) 
 They are a claim to you missingnresources, and they may be accurate.,You may not have the money,nor the Supreme Court,,but that is not the defining factor. 
 (Applause) (Laughter) 
 And you correct me if I'm wrong.,The defining factor is never resources;nit's resourcefulness.,And what I mean specifically,nrather than just some phrase,,is if you have emotion, human emotion,,something that I experienced from younthe day before yesterday,at a level that is as profoundnas I've ever experienced,and I believe with that emotionnyou would have beat his ass and won. 
 Audience: Yeah! 
 (Applause) (Cheering) 
 How easy for me to tell himnwhat he should do. 
 (Laughter) 
 Idiot, Robbins.,But I know when we watchednthe debate at that time,,there were emotionsnthat blocked people's ability,to get this man's intellect and capacity.,And the way that it came acrossnto some people on that day --,because I know people that wantednto vote in your direction and didn't,,and I was upset.,But there was emotion there.,Do you know what I'm talking about? 
 Say, "Aye." Audience: Aye. 
 TR: So, emotion is it.,And if we get the right emotion,nwe can get ourselves to do anything.,If you're creative, playful, fun enough,,can you get through to anybody, yes or no? 
 If you don't have the money,,but you're creative and determined,nyou find the way.,This is the ultimate resource.,But this is not the storynthat people tell us.,They tell us a bunch of different stories.,They tell us we don't haventhe resources, but ultimately,,if you take a look here,,they say, what are all the reasonsnthey haven't accomplished that?,He's broken my pattern,nthat son-of-a-bitch. 
 (Laughter) 
 But I appreciated the energy,nI'll tell you that. 
 (Laughter) 
 What determines your resources?,We've said decisions shape destiny,nwhich is my focus here.,If decisions shape destiny,nwhat determines it is three decisions.,What will you focus on?,You have to decidenwhat you're going to focus on.,Consciously or unconsciously.,the minute you decide to focus,nyou must give it a meaning,,and that meaning produces emotion.,Is this the end or the beginning?,Is God punishing me or rewarding me,nor is this the roll of the dice?,An emotion createsnwhat we're going to do, or the action. 
 So, think about your own life,,the decisions thatnhave shaped your destiny.,And that sounds really heavy,nbut in the last five or 10 years,,have there been some decisions,that if you'd made a different decision,nyour life would be completely different?,How many can think about it?nBetter or worse. Say, "Aye." 
 Audience: Aye. 
 So the bottom line is,nmaybe it was where to go to work,,and you met the love of your life there,na career decision.,I know the Google geniuses I saw here --,I mean, I understand that their decisionnwas to sell their technology.,What if they made that decisionnversus to build their own culture?,How would the world or their livesnbe different, their impact?,The history of our worldnis these decisions.,When a woman stands up and says,n"No, I won't go to the back of the bus.",She didn't just affect her life.nThat decision shaped our culture.,Or someone standing in front of a tank.,Or being in a positionnlike Lance Armstrong,,"You've got testicular cancer.",That's pretty tough for any male,nespecially if you ride a bike. 
 (Laughter) 
 You've got it in your brain;nyou've got it in your lungs.,But what was his decisionnof what to focus on?,Different than most people.nWhat did it mean?,It wasn't the end; it was the beginning.,He goes off and winsnseven championships he never once won,before the cancer, because he gotnemotional fitness, psychological strength.,That's the differencenin human beings that I've seen,of the three million I've been around. 
 In my lab, I've had three million peoplenfrom 80 countries over the last 29 years.,And after a while,npatterns become obvious.,You see that South America and Africanmay be connected in a certain way, right?,Others say, "Oh, that soundsnridiculous." It's simple.,So, what shaped Lance? What shapes you?,Two invisible forces.nVery quickly. One: state.,We all have had times,,you did something, and after,nyou thought to yourself,,"I can't believe I said or did that,nthat was so stupid.",Who's been there? Say, "Aye."nAudience: Aye. 
 Or after you did something,nyou go, "That was me!" 
 (Laughter) 
 It wasn't your ability; it was your state.,Your model of the worldnis what shapes you long term.,Your model of the world is the filter.nThat's what's shaping us.,It makes people make decisions.,To influence somebody, we need to knownwhat already influences them.,It's made up of three parts.,First, what's your target?nWhat are you after?,It's not your desires.,You can get your desires or goals.,Who has ever got a goal or desirenand thought, is this all there is? 
 Say, "Aye." Audience: Aye. 
 It's needs we have. I believenthere are six human needs.,Second, once you know what the targetnthat's driving you is,and you uncover it for the truth --nyou don't form it --,then you find out what's your map,,what's the belief systemsnthat tell you how to get those needs.,Some people think the waynto get them is to destroy the world,,some people, to build,ncreate something, love someone.,There's the fuel you pick.nSo very quickly, six needs. 
 Let me tell you what they are.nFirst one: certainty.,These are not goals or desires,nthese are universal.,Everyone needs certaintynthey can avoid pain,and at least be comfortable.,Now, how do you get it?,Control everybody? Develop a skill?nGive up? Smoke a cigarette?,And if you got totallyncertain, ironically,,even though we need that --,you're not certain about your health,nor your children, or money.,If you're not surenthe ceiling will hold up,,you won't listen to any speaker.,While we go for certainty differently,nif we get total certainty, we get what?,What do you feel if you're certain?,You know what will happen,nwhen and how it will happen,,what would you feel?,Bored out of your minds.nSo, God, in Her infinite wisdom,,gave us a second human need,nwhich is uncertainty.,We need variety. We need surprise.,How many of you herenlove surprises? Say, "Aye." 
 Audience: Aye. 
 TR: Bullshit. You likenthe surprises you want.,The ones you don't want,nyou call problems, but you need them.,So, variety is important.,Have you ever rented a videonor a film that you've already seen?,Who's done this? Get a fucking life. 
 (Laughter) 
 Why are you doing it?,You're certain it's goodnbecause you read or saw it before,,but you're hoping it's beennlong enough you've forgotten,,and there's variety. 
 Third human need, critical: significance.,We all need to feel important,nspecial, unique.,You can get it by making more moneynor being more spiritual.,You can do it by getting yourselfnin a situation where you put,more tattoos and earrings in placesnhumans don't want to know.,Whatever it takes.,The fastest way to do this,,if you have no background,nno culture, no belief and resources,or resourcefulness, is violence.,If I put a gun to your head and I livenin the 'hood, instantly I'm significant.,Zero to 10. How high? 10.,How certain am I thatnyou're going to respond to me? 10.,How much uncertainty?,Who knows what's going to happen next?nKind of exciting.,Like climbing up into a cavenand doing that stuff,all the way down there.,Total variety and uncertainty.,And it's significant, isn't it?nSo you want to risk your life for it.,So that's why violence has alwaysnbeen around and will be around,unless we have a consciousnessnchange as a species.,You can get significance a million ways,,but to be significant, you've gotnto be unique and different. 
 Here's what we really need:nconnection and love, fourth need.,We all want it;,most settle for connection,nlove's too scary.,Who here has been hurtnin an intimate relationship?,If you don't raise your hand,nyou've had other shit, too.,And you're going to get hurt again.,Aren't you glad you camento this positive visit?,Here's what's true: we need it.,We can do it throughnintimacy, friendship, prayer,,through walking in nature.,If nothing else works for you,ndon't get a cat, get a dog,,because if you leave for two minutes,nit's like you've been gone six months,,when you come back 5 minutes later. 
 These first four needs,nevery human finds a way to meet.,Even if you lie to yourself,nyou need to have split personalities.,I call the first four needsnthe needs of the personality.,The last two are the needs of the spirit.,And this is where fulfillment comes.,You won't get it from the first four.,You'll figure a way, smoke, drink,ndo whatever, meet the first four.,But number five, you must grow.,We all know the answer.,If you don't grow, you're what?,If a relationship or businessnis not growing,,if you're not growing,,doesn't matter how muchnmoney or friends you have,,how many love you,,you feel like hell.,And I believe the reason we grow,is so we have something to give of value. 
 Because the sixth neednis to contribute beyond ourselves.,Because we all know, corny as that sounds,,the secret to living is giving.,We all know life is not about me,nit's about we.,This culture knows that,nthis room knows that.,It's exciting.,When you see Nicholasntalking about his $100 computer,,the most exciting thing is:,here's a genius,nbut he's got a calling now.,You can feel the difference in him,nand it's beautiful.,And that calling can touch other people. 
 My life was touchednbecause when I was 11 years old,,Thanksgiving, no money, no food,,we were not going to starve,,but my father was totally messed up,,my mom was letting him knownhow bad he messed up,,and somebody came to the doornand delivered food.,My father made three decisions,nI know what they were, briefly.,His focus was "This is charity.,What does it mean? I'm worthless.,What do I have to do?nLeave my family," which he did.,It was one of the most painfulnexperiences of life.,My three decisionsngave me a different path.,I set focus on "There's food."nWhat a concept! 
 (Laughter) 
 But this is what changed my life,nshaped me as a human being.,Somebody's gift,nI don't even know who it is.,My father always said,n"No one gives a shit.",And now somebody I don't know,,they're not asking for anything,njust giving us food,,looking out for us.,It made me believe this:nthat strangers care.,And that made me decide,,if strangers care about me and my family,nI care about them.,I'm going to do somethingnto make a difference.,So when I was 17,nI went out on Thanksgiving,,it was my target for years to havenenough money to feed two families.,The most fun and moving thingnI ever did in my life.,Next year, I did four, then eight.,I didn't tell anybody what I was doing,nI wasn't doing it for brownie points.,But after eight,nI thought I could use some help. 
 So I went out, got my friends involved,,then I grew companies, got 11,nand I built the foundation.,18 years later,,I'm proud to tell you last year we fedn2 million people in 35 countries,through our foundation.,All during the holidays,nThanksgiving, Christmas,,in different countries around the world. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you.,I don't tell you that to brag,nbut because I'm proud of human beings,because they get excited to contribute,once they've had the chancento experience it, not talk about it. 
 So, finally -- I'm about out of time.,The target that shapes you --,Here's what's different about people.,We have the same needs.,But are you a certainty freak,nis that what you value most,,or uncertainty?,This man couldn't be a certainty freaknif he climbed through those caves.,Are you driven by significance or love?,We all need all six,,but what your lead system isntilts you in a different direction.,And as you move in a direction,nyou have a destination or destiny.,The second piece is the map.,The operating systemntells you how to get there,,and some people's map is,,"I'm going to save livesneven if I die for other people,",and they're a fireman,,and somebody else says,n"I'm going to kill people to do it.",They're trying to meetnthe same needs of significance.,They want to honor Godnor honor their family.,But they have a different map. 
 And there are seven different beliefs;nI can't go through them, because I'm done.,The last piece is emotion.,One of the parts of the map is like time.,Some people's ideanof a long time is 100 years.,Somebody else's is three seconds,nwhich is what I have.,And the last one I've already mentionednthat fell to you.,If you've got a target and a map --,I can't use Google because I love Macs,,and they haven't made itngood for Macs yet.,So if you use MapQuest --,how many have madenthis fatal mistake of using it?,You use this thingnand you don't get there.,Imagine if your beliefs guaranteenyou can never get to where you want to go. 
 (Laughter) 
 The last thing is emotion.,Here's what I'll tell you about emotion.,There are 6,000 emotions,that we have words fornin the English language,,which is just a linguistic representationnthat changes by language.,But if your dominant emotions --,If I have 20,000 people or 1,000,and I have them write downnall the emotions that they experience,in an average week,,and I give them as long as they need,,and on one sidenthey write empowering emotions,,the other's disempowering,,guess how many emotionsnthey experience? Less than 12.,And half of thosenmake them feel like shit.,They have six good feelings.,Happy, happy, excited, oh shit,,frustrated, frustrated,noverwhelmed, depressed.,How many of you know somebody,who, no matter what happens,nfinds a way to get pissed off? 
 (Laughter) 
 Or no matter what happens,nthey find a way to be happy or excited.,How many of you know somebody like this? 
 When 9/11 happened, I'll finishnwith this, I was in Hawaii.,I was with 2,000 people from 45 countries,,we were translatingnfour languages simultaneously,for a program I was conducting,nfor a week.,The night before was callednEmotional Mastery.,I got up, had no plannfor this, and I said --,we had fireworks,nI do crazy shit, fun stuff,,and at the end, I stopped.,I had this plan, but I never knownwhat I'm going to say.,And all of a sudden, I said,,"When do people really start to live?nWhen they face death.",And I went through this whole thing,about, if you weren't goingnto get off this island,,if nine days from now,nyou were going to die,,who would you call,nwhat would you say, what would you do?,That night is when 9/11 happened. 
 One woman had come to the seminar,nand when she came there,,her previous boyfriend had beennkidnapped and murdered.,Her new boyfriend wanted to marry her,nand she said no. 
 He said, "If you go to that Hawaii thing,nit's over with us.",She said, "It's over.",When I finished that night,nshe called him and left a message,at the top of the World Trade Centernwhere he worked, saying,,"I love you, I want you to knownI want to marry you.,It was stupid of me.",She was asleep, because it was 3 a.m.nfor us, when he called her back,,and said, "Honey, I can't tell younwhat this means.,I don't know how to tell you this,nbut you gave me the greatest gift,,because I'm going to die.",And she played the recordingnfor us in the room.,She was on Larry King later.,And he said, "You're probably wondering,how on Earth this couldnhappen to you twice.,All I can say is this must benGod's message to you.,From now on, every day,ngive your all, love your all.,Don't let anything ever stop you.",She finishes, and a mannstands up, and he says,,"I'm from Pakistan, I'm a Muslim.,I'd love to hold your handnand say I'm sorry,,but frankly, this is retribution.",I can't tell you the rest,nbecause I'm out of time. 
 (Laughter) 
 Are you sure? 
 (Laughter) 
 10 seconds! 
 (Laughter and applause) 
 10 seconds, I want to be respectful.,All I can tell you is,,I brought this man on stage,with a man from New York who workednin the World Trade Center,,because I had about 200 New Yorkers there.,More than 50 lostntheir entire companies, friends,,marking off their Palm Pilots.,One financial trader,nwoman made of steel, bawling --,30 friends crossing off that all died.,And I said, "What are wengoing to focus on?,What does this meannand what are we going to do?" 
 And I got the group to focus on:,if you didn't lose somebody today,,your focus is going to benhow to serve somebody else.,Then one woman stood upnand was so angry, screaming and yelling.,I found out she wasn't from New York,nshe's not an American,,doesn't know anybody here.,I asked, "Do you always get angry?",She said, "Yes.",Guilty people got guilty,nsad people got sad.,I took these two mennand I did an indirect negotiation.,Jewish man with familynin the occupied territory,,someone in New York who would have diednif he was at work that day,,and this man who wanted to be a terrorist,,and I made it very clear.,This integration is on a film,nwhich I'd be happy to send you,,instead of my verbalization,,but the two of them not only came together,and changed their beliefsnand models of the world,,but worked together to bring,nfor almost four years now,,through various mosques and synagogues,,the idea of how to create peace.,And he wrote a book, calledn"My Jihad, My Way of Peace.",So, transformation can happen. 
 My invitation to you is:,explore your web,,the web in here --,the needs, the beliefs, the emotionsnthat are controlling you,,for two reasons:,so there's more of you to give,nand achieve, too,,but I mean give,,because that's what'sngoing to fill you up.,And secondly, so you can appreciate --,not just understand,nthat's intellectual, that's the mind,,but appreciatenwhat's driving other people.,It's the only waynour world's going to change. 
 God bless you, thank you.nI hope this was of service. 
 (Applause)My name is Ursus Wehrli, and I would like to talk to you this morning,about my project, Tidying Up Art.,First of all -- any questions so far?,First of all, I have to say I'm not from around here.,I'm from a completely different cultural area, maybe you noticed?,I mean, I'm wearing a tie, first. And then secondly, I'm a little bit nervous,because I'm speaking in a foreign language,,and I want to apologize in advance, for any mistakes I might make.,Because I'm from Switzerland, and I just don't hope you think this is Swiss German,I'm speaking now here. This is just what it sounds like,if we Swiss try to speak American.,But don't worry -- I don't have trouble with English, as such.,I mean, it's not my problem, it's your language after all.,(Laughter),I am fine. After this presentation here at TED, I can simply go back to Switzerland,,and you have to go on talking like this all the time.,(Laughter) 
 So I've been asked by the organizers to read from my book.,It's called "Tidying Up Art" and it's, as you can see,,it's more or less a picture book.,So the reading would be over very quickly.,But since I'm here at TED, I decided to hold my talk here in a more modern way,,in the spirit of TED here, and I managed to do some slides here for you.,I'd like to show them around so we can just, you know --,(Laughter),Actually, I managed to prepare for you some enlarged pictures -- even better. 
 So Tidying Up Art, I mean, I have to say, that's a relatively new term.,You won't be familiar with it.,I mean, it's a hobby of mine that I've been indulging in for the last few years,,and it all started out with this picture of the American artist, Donald Baechler,I had hanging at home. I had to look at it every day,and after a while I just couldn't stand the mess anymore,this guy was looking at all day long.,Yeah, I kind of felt sorry for him.,And it seemed to me even he felt really bad,facing these unorganized red squares day after day.,So I decided to give him a little support,,and brought some order into neatly stacking the blocks on top of each other.,(Laughter),Yeah. And I think he looks now less miserable.,And it was great. With this experience, I started to look more closely,at modern art. Then I realized how, you know, the world of modern art,is particularly topsy-turvy. 
 And I can show here a very good example.,It's actually a simple one, but it's a good one to start with.,It's a picture by Paul Klee.,And we can see here very clearly, it's a confusion of color.,(Laughter),Yeah. The artist doesn't really seem to know where to put the different colors.,The various pictures here of the various elements of the picture --,the whole thing is unstructured.,We don't know, maybe Mr. Klee was probably in a hurry, I mean --,(Laughter),-- maybe he had to catch a plane, or something.,We can see here he started out with orange,,and then he already ran out of orange,,and here we can see he decided to take a break for a square.,And I would like to show you here my tidied up version of this picture.,(Laughter),We can see now what was barely recognizable in the original:,17 red and orange squares are juxtaposed with just two green squares.,Yeah, that's great.,So I mean, that's just tidying up for beginners.,I would like to show you here a picture which is a bit more advanced.,(Laughter) 
 What can you say? What a mess.,I mean, you see, everything seems to have been scattered aimlessly around the space.,If my room back home had looked like this,,my mother would have grounded me for three days.,So I'd like to -- I wanted to reintroduce some structure into that picture.,And that's really advanced tidying up.,(Applause),Yeah, you're right. Sometimes people clap at this point,,but that's actually more in Switzerland.,(Laughter),We Swiss are famous for chocolate and cheese. Our trains run on time.,We are only happy when things are in order. 
 But to go on, here is a very good example to see.,This is a picture by Joan Miro.,And yeah, we can see the artist has drawn a few lines and shapes,and dropped them any old way onto a yellow background.,And yeah, it's the sort of thing you produce when you're doodling on the phone.,(Laughter),And this is my --,(Laughter),-- you can see now the whole thing takes up far less space.,It's more economical and also more efficient.,With this method Mr. Miro could have saved canvas for another picture. 
 But I can see in your faces that you're still a little bit skeptical.,So that you can just appreciate how serious I am about all this,,I brought along the patents, the specifications for some of these works,,because I've had my working methods patented,at the Eidgenössische Amt für Geistiges Eigentum in Bern, Switzerland.,(Laughter),I'll just quote from the specification.,"Laut den Kunstprüfer Dr. Albrecht --",It's not finished yet.,"Laut den Kunstprüfer Dr. Albrecht Götz von Ohlenhusen,wird die Verfahrensweise rechtlich geschützt welche die Kunst,durch spezifisch aufgeräumte Regelmässigkeiten,des allgemeinen Formenschatzes,neue Wirkungen zu erzielen möglich wird." 
 Ja, well I could have translated that, but you would have been none the wiser.,I'm not sure myself what it means but it sounds good anyway.,I just realized it's important how one introduces new ideas to people,,that's why these patents are sometimes necessary.,I would like to do a short test with you.,Everyone is sitting in quite an orderly fashion here this morning.,So I would like to ask you all to raise your right hand. Yeah.,The right hand is the one we write with, apart from the left-handers.,And now, I'll count to three. I mean, it still looks very orderly to me.,Now, I'll count to three, and on the count of three,I'd like you all to shake hands with the person behind you. OK?,One, two, three.,(Laughter) 
 You can see now, that's a good example: even behaving in an orderly, systematic way,can sometimes lead to complete chaos.,So we can also see that very clearly in this next painting.,This is a painting by the artist, Niki de Saint Phalle.,And I mean, in the original it's completely unclear to see,what this tangle of colors and shapes is supposed to depict.,But in the tidied up version, it's plain to see that it's a sunburnt woman playing volleyball.,(Laughter),Yeah, it's a -- this one here, that's much better.,That's a picture by Keith Haring.,(Laughter),I think it doesn't matter.,So, I mean, this picture has not even got a proper title.,It's called "Untitled" and I think that's appropriate. 
 So, in the tidied-up version we have a sort of Keith Haring spare parts shop.,(Laughter),This is Keith Haring looked at statistically.,One can see here quite clearly,,you can see we have 25 pale green elements,,of which one is in the form of a circle.,Or here, for example, we have 27 pink squares with only one pink curve.,I mean, that's interesting. One could extend this sort of statistical analysis,to cover all Mr. Haring's various works,,in order to establish in which period the artist favored pale green circles or pink squares.,And the artist himself could also benefit from this sort of listing procedure,by using it to estimate how many pots of paint he's likely to need in the future.,(Laughter) 
 One can obviously also make combinations.,For example, with the Keith Haring circles and Kandinsky's dots.,You can add them to all the squares of Paul Klee.,In the end, one has a list with which one then can arrange.,Then you categorize it, then you file it, put that file in a filing cabinet,,put it in your office and you can make a living doing it.,(Laughter),Yeah, from my own experience. So I'm --,(Laughter),Actually, I mean, here we have some artists that are a bit more structured. It's not too bad.,This is Jasper Johns. We can see here he was practicing with his ruler.,(Laughter) 
 But I think it could still benefit from more discipline.,And I think the whole thing adds up much better if you do it like this.,(Laughter),And here, that's one of my favorites.,Tidying up Rene Magritte -- this is really fun.,You know, there is a --,(Laughter),I'm always being asked what inspired me to embark on all this.,It goes back to a time when I was very often staying in hotels.,So once I had the opportunity to stay in a ritzy, five-star hotel.,And you know, there you had this little sign --,I put this little sign outside the door every morning that read,,"Please tidy room." I don't know if you have them over here.,So actually, my room there hasn't been tidied once daily, but three times a day.,So after a while I decided to have a little fun,,and before leaving the room each day I'd scatter a few things around the space.,Like books, clothes, toothbrush, etc. And it was great.,By the time I returned everything had always been neatly returned to its place.,But then one morning, I hang the same little sign onto that picture by Vincent van Gogh.,(Laughter),And you have to say this room hadn't been tidied up since 1888.,And when I returned it looked like this.,(Laughter),Yeah, at least it is now possible to do some vacuuming.,(Laughter) 
 OK, I mean, I can see there are always people,that like reacting that one or another picture,hasn't been properly tidied up. So we can make a short test with you.,This is a picture by Rene Magritte,,and I'd like you all to inwardly -- like in your head, that is --,to tidy that up. So it's possible that some of you would make it like this.,(Laughter),Yeah? I would actually prefer to do it more this way.,Some people would make apple pie out of it.,But it's a very good example to see that the whole work,was more of a handicraft endeavor that involved the very time-consuming job,of cutting out the various elements and sticking them back in new arrangements.,And it's not done, as many people imagine, with the computer,,otherwise it would look like this.,(Laughter) 
 So now I've been able to tidy up pictures that I've wanted to tidy up for a long time.,Here is a very good example. Take Jackson Pollock, for example.,It's -- oh, no, it's -- that's a really hard one.,But after a while, I just decided here to go all the way,and put the paint back into the cans.,(Applause),Or you could go into three-dimensional art.,Here we have the fur cup by Meret Oppenheim.,Here I just brought it back to its original state.,(Laughter),But yeah, and it's great, you can even go, you know --,Or we have this pointillist movement for those of you who are into art.,The pointillist movement is that kind of paintings,where everything is broken down into dots and pixels.,And then I -- this sort of thing is ideal for tidying up.,(Laughter) 
 So I once applied myself to the work of the inventor of that method, Georges Seurat,,and I collected together all his dots.,And now they're all in here.,(Laughter),You can count them afterwards, if you like.,You see, that's the wonderful thing about the tidy up art idea:,it's new. So there is no existing tradition in it.,There is no textbooks, I mean, not yet, anyway.,I mean, it's "the future we will create.",(Laughter),But to round things up I would like to show you just one more.,This is the village square by Pieter Bruegel.,That's how it looks like when you send everyone home.,(Laughter),Yeah, maybe you're asking yourselves,where old Bruegel's people went?,Of course, they're not gone. They're all here.,(Laughter),I just piled them up.,(Laughter) 
 So I'm -- yeah, actually I'm kind of finished at that moment.,And for those who want to see more, I've got my book downstairs in the bookshop.,And I'm happy to sign it for you with any name of any artist.,(Laughter),But before leaving I would like to show you,,I'm working right now on another -- in a related field,with my tidying up art method. I'm working in a related field.,And I started to bring some order into some flags.,Here -- that's just my new proposal here for the Union Jack.,(Laughter),And then maybe before I leave you ...,yeah, I think, after you have seen that I have to leave anyway.,(Laughter),Yeah, that was a hard one. I couldn't find a way to tidy that up properly,,so I just decided to make it a little bit more simpler.,(Laughter),Thank you very much.,(Applause)I'm really excited to be here today.,I'll show you some stuffnthat's just ready to come out of the lab,,literally, and I'm really gladnthat you guys,are going to be amongnthe first to see it in person,,because I really think this is goingnto really change,the way we interactnwith machines from this point on. 
 Now, this is a rear-projectedndrafting table.,It's about 36 inches wide,and it's equippednwith a multi-touch sensor.,Normal touch sensors that you see,,like on a kiosknor interactive whiteboards,,can only register one pointnof contact at a time.,This thing allows you to havenmultiple points at the same time.,They can use both my hands;nI can use chording actions;,I can just go right up and usenall 10 fingers if I wanted to.,You know, like that. 
 Now, multi-touch sensingnisn't completely new.,People like Bill Buxton have beennplaying around with it in the '80s.,However, the approach I built herenis actually high-resolution,,low-cost, and probablynmost importantly, very scalable.,So, the technology, you know,,isn't the most exciting thingnhere right now,,other than probablynits newfound accessibility.,What's really interesting herenis what you can do with it,and the kind of interfacesnyou can build on top of it.,So let's see. 
 So, for instance, we havena lava lamp application here.,Now, you can see,,I can use both of my hands to kindnof squeeze and put the blobs together.,I can inject heat into the system here,,or I can pull it apartnwith two of my fingers.,It's completely intuitive;nthere's no instruction manual.,The interface just kind of disappears.,This started out as a screensaver app,that one of the Ph.D. studentsnin our lab, Ilya Rosenberg, made.,But I think its true identityncomes out here. 
 Now what's great about a multi-touchnsensor is that, you know,,I could be doing thisnwith as many fingers here,,but of course multi-touchnalso inherently means multi-user.,Chris could be interactingnwith another part of Lava,,while I play around with it here.,You can imaginena new kind of sculpting tool,,where I'm kind of warming something up,nmaking it malleable,,and then letting it cool downnand solidifying in a certain state.,Google should havensomething like this in their lobby. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'll show you a little morenof a concrete example here,,as this thing loads.,This is a photographer'snlight-box application.,Again, I can use both of my handsnto interact and move photos around.,But what's even coolernis that if I have two fingers,,I can actually grab a photo and thennstretch it out like that really easily.,I can pan, zoomnand rotate it effortlessly.,I can do that grosslynwith both of my hands,,or I can do it just with two fingersnon each of my hands together.,If I grab the canvas, I can donthe same thing -- stretch it out.,I can do it simultaneously,nholding this down,,and gripping on another one,nstretching this out. 
 Again, the interface just disappears here.,There's no manual.,This is exactly what you expect,,especially if you haven't interactednwith a computer before.,Now, when you have initiativesnlike the $100 laptop,,I kind of cringe at the idea,of introducing a whole newngeneration to computing,with this standardnmouse-and-windows-pointer interface.,This is something that I thinknis really the way,we should be interactingnwith machines from now on. 
 (Applause) 
 Now, of course, I can bring up a keyboard. 
 (Laughter),And I can bring that around,nput that up there.,Obviously, this is a standard keyboard,,but of course I can rescale itnto make it work well for my hands.,That's really important, becausenthere's no reason in this day and age,that we should be conformingnto a physical device.,That leads to bad things, like RSI.,We have so much technology nowadays,that these interfacesnshould start conforming to us.,There's so little applied nownto actually improving,the way we interact with interfacesnfrom this point on.,This keyboard is probably actuallynthe really wrong direction to go.,You can imagine, in the future,nas we develop this kind of technology,,a keyboard that kind of automaticallyndrifts as your hand moves away,,and really intelligently anticipatesnwhich key you're trying to stroke.,So -- again, isn't this great? 
 (Laughter) 
 Audience: Where's your lab? 
 Jeff Han: I'm a research scientistnat NYU in New York. 
 Here's an example of another kind of app.nI can make these little fuzz balls.,It'll remember the strokes I'm making.,Of course I can do it with all my hands.,It's pressure-sensitive.,What's neat about that is,,I showed that two-finger gesturenthat zooms in really quickly.,Because you don't havento switch to a hand tool,or the magnifying glass tool,,you can just continuously make things,in real multiple scales,nall at the same time.,I can create big things out here,,but I can go backnand really quickly go back,to where I started,nand make even smaller things here. 
 This is going to be really important,as we start getting to thingsnlike data visualization.,For instance, I thinknwe all enjoyed Hans Rosling's talk,,and he really emphasized the factnI've been thinking about for a long time:,We have all this great data,,but for some reason,nit's just sitting there.,We're not accessing it.,And one of the reasons why I think that is,will be helped by things like graphicsnand visualization and inference tools,,but I also think a big part of it,is going to be having better interfaces,,to be able to drill downninto this kind of data,,while still thinkingnabout the big picture here. 
 Let me show you another app here.nThis is called WorldWind.,It's done by NASA.,We've all seen Google Earth;,this is an open-source version of that.,There are plug-ins to be ablento load in different data sets,that NASA's collected over the years.,As you can see, I can usenthe same two-fingered gestures,to go down and go in really seamlessly.,There's no interface, again.,It really allows anybodynto kind of go in --,and it just doesnwhat you'd expect, you know?,Again, there's just no interface here.nThe interface just disappears.,I can switch to different data views.,That's what's neat about this app here.,NASA's really cool.,These hyper-spectral imagesnare false-colored so you can --,it's really good for determiningnvegetative use.,Well, let's go back to this. 
 The great thingnabout mapping applications --,it's not really 2D, it's 3D.,So, again, with a multi-point interface,nyou can do a gesture like this --,so you can be ablento tilt around like that -- 
 (Surprised laughter) 
 It's not just simply relegatednto a kind of 2D panning and motion.,This gesture is just puttingntwo fingers down --,it's defining an axis of tilt --nand I can tilt up and down that way.,We just came up with that on the spot,,it's probably not the right thing to do,,but there's such interesting thingsnyou can do with this interface.,It's just so much funnplaying around with it, too. 
 (Laughter) 
 And so the last thingnI want to show you is --,I'm sure we can all thinknof a lot of entertainment apps,that you can do with this thing.,I'm more interested in the creativenapplications we can do with this.,Now, here's a simple application here --nI can draw out a curve.,And when I close it,nit becomes a character.,But the neat thing about itnis I can add control points.,And then what I can do is manipulate themnwith both of my fingers at the same time.,And you notice what it does.,It's kind of a puppeteering thing,,where I can use as many fingersnas I have to draw and make -- 
 Now, there's a lot of actual mathngoing on under here,for this to control this meshnand do the right thing.,This technique of being able to manipulatena mesh here, with multiple control points,,is actually state of the art.,It was released at SIGGRAPH last year.,It's a great examplenof the kind of research I really love:,all this compute powernto make things do the right things,,intuitive things,nto do exactly what you expect. 
 So, multi-touch interaction researchnis a very active field right now in HCI.,I'm not the only one doing it,na lot of other people are getting into it.,This kind of technology is going to letneven more people get into it,,I'm looking forward to interactingnwith all of you over the next few days,and seeing how it can applynto your respective fields. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)About 10 years ago, I took on the tasknto teach global development,to Swedish undergraduate students.,That was after having spent about 20 years,together with African institutionsnstudying hunger in Africa,,so I was sort of expectednto know a little about the world.,And I started in our medical university,nKarolinska Institute,,an undergraduate coursencalled Global Health.,But when you get that opportunity,nyou get a little nervous.,I thought, these students coming to us,actually have the highest gradenyou can get in Swedish college systems --,so I thought, maybe they know everythingnI'm going to teach them about.,So I did a pre-test when they came.,And one of the questionsnfrom which I learned a lot was this one:,"Which country has the highestnchild mortality of these five pairs?" 
 I put them together,nso that in each pair of country,,one has twice the childnmortality of the other.,And this means thatnit's much bigger a difference,than the uncertainty of the data.,I won't put you at a test here,nbut it's Turkey,,which is highest there, Poland,nRussia, Pakistan and South Africa.,And these were the resultsnof the Swedish students.,I did it so I got the confidence interval,nwhich is pretty narrow, and I got happy,,of course: a 1.8 right answernout of five possible.,That means that there was a placenfor a professor of international health,and for my course. 
 (Laughter) 
 But one late night,nwhen I was compiling the report,,I really realized my discovery.,I have shown that Swedish top students,know statistically significantly lessnabout the world than the chimpanzees. 
 (Laughter) 
 Because the chimpanzeenwould score half right,if I gave them two bananasnwith Sri Lanka and Turkey.,They would be right half of the cases.nBut the students are not there.,The problem for me was not ignorance;nit was preconceived ideas. 
 I did also an unethical study,of the professorsnof the Karolinska Institute,,that hands outnthe Nobel Prize in Medicine,,and they are on parnwith the chimpanzee there. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is where I realized thatnthere was really a need to communicate,,because the datanof what's happening in the world,and the child healthnof every country is very well aware. 
 We did this softwarenwhich displays it like this:,every bubble here is a country.,This country over here is China.,This is India.,The size of the bubble is the population,,and on this axis here,nI put fertility rate.,Because my students, what they said,when they looked upon the world,nand I asked them,,"What do you reallynthink about the world?",Well, I first discoverednthat the textbook was Tintin, mainly. 
 (Laughter) 
 And they said, "The worldnis still 'we' and 'them.',And 'we' is Western worldnand 'them' is Third World.","And what do you meannwith Western world?" I said.,"Well, that's long life and small family,,and Third World is short lifenand large family." 
 So this is what I could display here.,I put fertility rate here:nnumber of children per woman:,one, two, three, four,nup to about eight children per woman.,We have very good datansince 1962 -- 1960 about --,on the size of families in all countries.,The error margin is narrow.,Here, I put life expectancy at birth,,from 30 years in some countriesnup to about 70 years.,And 1962, there was reallyna group of countries here,that was industrialized countries,,and they had small familiesnand long lives.,And these were the developing countries:,they had large familiesnand they had relatively short lives.,Now, what has happened since 1962?nWe want to see the change.,Are the students right?nIs it still two types of countries?,Or have these developing countriesngot smaller families and they live here?,Or have they got longer livesnand live up there? 
 Let's see. We stopped the world then.,This is all U.N. statisticsnthat have been available.,Here we go. Can you see there?,It's China there, moving againstnbetter health there, improving there.,All the green Latin American countriesnare moving towards smaller families.,Your yellow ones herenare the Arabic countries,,and they get longer life,nbut not larger families.,The Africans are the green here.nThey still remain here.,This is India; Indonesianis moving on pretty fast. 
 (Laughter) 
 In the '80s here, you have Bangladeshnstill among the African countries.,But now, Bangladesh --nit's a miracle that happens in the '80s:,the imams start to promotenfamily planning.,They move up into that corner.,And in the '90s, we haventhe terrible HIV epidemic,that takes down the life expectancynof the African countries,and all the rest of themnmove up into the corner,,where we have long lives and small family,nand we have a completely new world. 
 (Applause) 
 (Applause ends) 
 Let me make a comparison directly,between the United Statesnof America and Vietnam.,1964.,America had small families and long life;,Vietnam had large familiesnand short lives.,And this is what happens:,the data during the war indicatenthat even with all the death,,there was an improvementnof life expectancy.,By the end of the year,nthe family planning started in Vietnam;,they went for smaller families.,And the United States up therenis getting for longer life,,keeping family size.,And in the '80s now,nthey give up Communist planning,and they go for market economy,,and it moves faster even than social life.,And today, we have in Vietnam,the same life expectancynand the same family size,here in Vietnam, 2003,,as in United States, 1974,nby the end of the war.,If we don't look in the data,,I think we all underestimatenthe tremendous change in Asia,,which was in social changenbefore we saw the economical change. 
 Let's move over to another way herenin which we could display,the distributionnin the world of the income.,This is the world distributionnof income of people.,One dollar, 10 dollarsnor 100 dollars per day.,There's no gap between richnand poor any longer. This is a myth.,There's a little hump here.,But there are people all the way.,And if we look where the income ends up,,this is 100 percentnthe world's annual income.,And the richest 20 percent,,they take out of that about 74 percent.,And the poorest 20 percent,nthey take about two percent.,And this shows that the conceptnof developing countries,is extremely doubtful.,We think about aid,,like these people here giving aidnto these people here.,But in the middle, we havenmost of the world population,,and they have nown24 percent of the income. 
 We heard it in other forms.nAnd who are these?,Where are the different countries?nI can show you Africa.,This is Africa.,10\% the world population, most in poverty.,This is OECD.,The rich country.nThe country club of the U.N.,And they are over here on this side.nQuite an overlap between Africa and OECD.,And this is Latin America.,It has everything on this Earth,nfrom the poorest to the richest,in Latin America.,And on top of that,nwe can put East Europe,,we can put East Asia,nand we put South Asia. 
 And how did it look likenif we go back in time,,to about 1970?,Then there was more of a hump.,And we have most who livednin absolute poverty were Asians.,The problem in the worldnwas the poverty in Asia.,And if I now let the world move forward,,you will see thatnwhile population increases,,there are hundreds of millionsnin Asia getting out of poverty,and some others getting into poverty,,and this is the pattern we have today.,And the best projectionnfrom the World Bank,is that this will happen,,and we will not have a divided world.,We'll have most people in the middle. 
 Of course it's a logarithmic scale here,,but our concept of economynis growth with percent.,We look upon it as a possibilitynof percentile increase.,If I change this, and take GDP per capitaninstead of family income,,and I turn these individual data,into regional datanof gross domestic product,,and I take the regions down here,,the size of the bubblenis still the population.,And you have the OECD there,nand you have sub-Saharan Africa there,,and we take off the Arab states there,,coming both from Africa and from Asia,nand we put them separately,,and we can expand this axis,nand I can give it a new dimension here,,by adding the social valuesnthere, child survival.,Now I have money on that axis,,and I have the possibilitynof children to survive there.,In some countries, 99.7\% of childrennsurvive to five years of age;,others, only 70.,And here, it seems,nthere is a gap between OECD,,Latin America, East Europe, East Asia,,Arab states, South Asianand sub-Saharan Africa.,The linearity is very strongnbetween child survival and money. 
 But let me split sub-Saharan Africa.,Health is therenand better health is up there.,I can go here and I can splitnsub-Saharan Africa into its countries.,And when it burst,,the size of its country bubblenis the size of the population.,Sierra Leone down there.nMauritius is up there.,Mauritius was the first country,to get away with trade barriers,nand they could sell their sugar --,they could sell their textiles --,on equal terms as the peoplenin Europe and North America. 
 There's a huge difference between Africa.nAnd Ghana is here in the middle.,In Sierra Leone, humanitarian aid.,Here in Uganda, development aid.,Here, time to invest;nthere, you can go for a holiday.,It's a tremendous variation within Africa,which we rarely often maken-- that it's equal everything.,I can split South Asia here.nIndia's the big bubble in the middle.,But a huge differencenbetween Afghanistan and Sri Lanka.,I can split Arab states. How are they?,Same climate, same culture,nsame religion -- huge difference.,Even between neighbors.,Yemen, civil war.,United Arab Emirates, money,nwhich was quite equally and well used.,Not as the myth is.,And that includes all the childrennof the foreign workers,who are in the country. 
 Data is often better than you think.nMany people say data is bad.,There is an uncertainty margin,nbut we can see the difference here:,Cambodia, Singapore.,The differences are much biggernthan the weakness of the data.,East Europe: Soviet economynfor a long time,,but they come out after 10 yearsnvery, very differently.,And there is Latin America.,Today, we don't have to go to Cuba,to find a healthy countrynin Latin America.,Chile will have a lower child mortalitynthan Cuba within some few years from now.,Here, we have high-incomencountries in the OECD. 
 And we get the whole patternnhere of the world,,which is more or less like this.,And if we look at it, how the world looks,,in 1960, it starts to move.,This is Mao Tse-tung.nHe brought health to China.,And then he died.,And then Deng Xiaoping camenand brought money to China,,and brought themninto the mainstream again.,And we have seen how countriesnmove in different directions like this,,so it's sort of difficult to getnan example country,which shows the pattern of the world. 
 But I would like to bring you backnto about here, at 1960.,I would like to compare,South Korea, which is this one,nwith Brazil, which is this one.,The label went away for me here.,And I would like to compare Uganda,nwhich is there.,And I can run it forward, like this.,And you can see how South Korea is makingna very, very fast advancement,,whereas Brazil is much slower. 
 And if we move back again, here,nand we put on trails on them, like this,,you can see againnthat the speed of development,is very, very different,,and the countries are moving more or lessnin the same rate as money and health,,but it seems you can move much faster,if you are healthy firstnthan if you are wealthy first.,And to show that, you can putnon the way of United Arab Emirates.,They came from here, a mineral country.,They cached all the oil;nthey got all the money;,but health cannot be boughtnat the supermarket.,You have to invest in health.nYou have to get kids into schooling.,You have to train health staff.nYou have to educate the population.,And Sheikh Zayed did thatnin a fairly good way.,In spite of falling oil prices,nhe brought this country up here.,So we've got a much more mainstreamnappearance of the world,,where all countries tendnto use their money,better than they used in the past. 
 Now, this is, more or less, if you looknat the average data of the countries --,they are like this.,Now that's dangerous, to use average data,,because there is suchna lot of difference within countries.,So if I go and look here,nwe can see that Uganda today,is where South Korea was in 1960.,If I split Uganda, there's quitena difference within Uganda.,These are the quintiles of Uganda.,The richest 20 percentnof Ugandans are there.,The poorest are down there.,If I split South Africa, it's like this.,And if I go down and look at Niger,,where there was suchna terrible famine, lastly, it's like this.,The 20 percent poorestnof Niger is out here,,and the 20 percent richestnof South Africa is there,,and yet we tend to discuss,on what solutionsnthere should be in Africa.,Everything in this world exists in Africa.,And you can't discussnuniversal access to HIV [medicine],for that quintile up herenwith the same strategy as down here.,The improvement of the worldnmust be highly contextualized,,and it's not relevant to have itnon regional level.,We must be much more detailed.,We find that students getnvery excited when they can use this. 
 And even more, policy makersnand the corporate sectors,would like to seenhow the world is changing.,Now, why doesn't this take place?,Why are we not using the data we have?,We have data in the United Nations,nin the national statistical agencies,and in universities and othernnon-governmental organizations.,Because the data is hiddenndown in the databases.,And the public is there,nand the Internet is there,,but we have still not used it effectively. 
 All that informationnwe saw changing in the world,does not includenpublicly-funded statistics.,There are some web pagesnlike this, you know,,but they take some nourishmentndown from the databases,,but people put prices on them,nstupid passwords and boring statistics. 
 (Laughter) 
 And this won't work. 
 (Applause) 
 So what is needed? We have the databases.,It's not the new database you need.,We have wonderful design tools,nand more and more are added up here.,So we started a nonprofit venture,which, linking data to design,nwe called Gapminder,,from the London Underground,,where they warn you, "mind the gap.",So we thought Gapminder was appropriate.,And we started to write softwarenwhich could link the data like this.,And it wasn't that difficult.,It took some person years,nand we have produced animations.,You can take a data set and put it there.,We are liberating U.N. data,nsome few U.N. organization. 
 Some countries accept thatntheir databases can go out on the world,,but what we really need is,nof course, a search function.,A search function where we can copynthe data up to a searchable format,and get it out in the world.,And what do we hear when we go around?,I've done anthropologynon the main statistical units.,Everyone says, "It's impossible.nThis can't be done.,Our information is so peculiar in detail,,so that cannot be searchednas others can be searched.,We cannot give the datanfree to the students,,free to the entrepreneurs of the world." 
 But this is what we wouldnlike to see, isn't it?,The publicly-funded data is down here.,And we would like flowersnto grow out on the Net.,And one of the crucial pointsnis to make them searchable,,and then people can use the differentndesign tool to animate it there.,And I have pretty good news for you.,I have good news that the present,,new Head of U.N. Statistics,nhe doesn't say it's impossible.,He only says, "We can't do it." 
 (Laughter) 
 And that's a quite clever guy, huh? 
 (Laughter) 
 So we can see a lot happeningnin data in the coming years.,We will be able to look at incomendistributions in completely new ways.,This is the income distributionnof China, 1970.,This is the income distributionnof the United States, 1970.,Almost no overlap.,And what has happened?,What has happened is this:,that China is growing,nit's not so equal any longer,,and it's appearing here,noverlooking the United States.,Almost like a ghost, isn't it? 
 (Laughter) 
 It's pretty scary. 
 (Laughter) 
 But I think it's very importantnto have all this information.,We need really to see it.,And instead of looking at this,,I would like to end up by showingnthe Internet users per 1,000.,In this software, we accessnabout 500 variables,from all the countries quite easily.,It takes some time to change for this,,but on the axises, you can quite easilynget any variable you would like to have.,And the thing would bento get up the databases free,,to get them searchable,nand with a second click,,to get them into the graphic formats,nwhere you can instantly understand them.,Now, statisticians don't like it,,because they saynthat this will not show the reality;,we have to have statistical,nanalytical methods.,But this is hypothesis-generating. 
 I end now with the world.,There, the Internet is coming.,The number of Internet usersnare going up like this.,This is the GDP per capita.,And it's a new technology coming in,nbut then amazingly,,how well it fits to the economynof the countries.,That's why the $100 computernwill be so important.,But it's a nice tendency.,It's as if the worldnis flattening off, isn't it?,These countries are lifting morenthan the economy,and will be very interestingnto follow this over the year,,as I would like you to be able to donwith all the publicly funded data. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)With all the legitimate concernsnabout AIDS and avian flu --,and we'll hear about that from the,brilliant Dr. Brilliant later today --,I want to talk about the othernpandemic, which is,cardiovascular disease,ndiabetes, hypertension --,all of which are completelynpreventable for at,least 95 percent of people,just by changing diet and lifestyle. 
 And what's happening is that there's a,globalization of illnessnoccurring, that people,are starting to eat like us,nand live like us, and,die like us. Andnin one generation, for example,,Asia's gone from havingnone of the lowest rates of,heart disease and obesitynand diabetes to one,of the highest. And in Africa,ncardiovascular disease,equals the HIV and AIDS deaths,in most countries.,So there's a criticalnwindow of opportunity we,have to make an importantndifference that can,affect the lives of literallynmillions of people,,and practice preventivenmedicine on a global,scale. 
 Heart and blood vesselndiseases still kill more,people -- not only in thisncountry, but also,worldwide -- than everythingnelse combined, and yet,it's completely preventablenfor almost everybody.,It's not only preventable; it's actually,reversible. And for the lastnalmost 29 years,,we've been able to shownthat by simply changing,diet and lifestyle, usingnthese very high-tech,,expensive, state-of-the-artnmeasures to prove how,powerful these very simplenand low-tech and low-cost,interventions can be like -- quantitative,arteriography,nbefore and after a year, and,cardiac PET scans. 
 We showed a few monthsnago -- we published the,first study showing youncan actually stop or,reverse the progressionnof prostate cancer by,making changes in dietnand lifestyle, and 70 percent,regression in the tumorngrowth, or inhibition of,the tumor growth, comparednto only nine percent in the,control group.,And in the MRI and MRnspectroscopy here, the,prostate tumor activitynis shown in red -- you can,see it diminishing after a year. 
 Now there is an epidemicnof obesity: two-thirds of,adults and 15 percent of kids.nWhat's really concerning,to me is that diabetes hasnincreased 70 percent in the,past 10 years, and this may be the first,generation in which our kidsnlive a shorter life,span than we do. That's pitiful, and it's,preventable.,Now these are not electionnreturns, these are the,people -- the numbernof the people who are obese,by state, beginning in '85,n'86, '87 -- these are,from the CDC website --n'88, '89, '90, '91 -- you,get a new category --n'92, '93, '94, '95, '96,,'97, '98, '99, 2000, 2001n-- it gets worse. We're,kind of devolving. (Laughter) 
 Now what can we do about this?nWell, you know, the,diet that we've foundnthat can reverse heart,disease and cancer is an Asian diet.,But the people in Asianare starting to eat like we,are, which is why they'renstarting to get sick,like we are.,So I've been workingnwith a lot of the big food,companies. They can makenit fun and sexy and hip,and crunchy and convenientnto eat healthier foods,,like -- I chair the advisorynboards to McDonald's,,and PepsiCo, and ConAgra,nand Safeway, and soon,Del Monte, and they'renfinding that it's good,business.,The salads that you seenat McDonald's came from,the work -- they're goingnto have an Asian salad. At,Pepsi, two-thirdsnof their revenue growth came,from their better foods. 
 And so if we can do that,nthen we can free up,resources for buying drugsnthat you really do need,for treating AIDS and HIVnand malaria and for,preventing avian flu. Thank you.I'm going to presentnthree projects in rapid fire.,I don't have much time to do it.,And I want to reinforce three ideasnwith that rapid-fire presentation. 
 The first is what I like to callna hyper-rational process.,It's a process that takes rationalitynalmost to an absurd level,,and it transcends all the baggage,that normally comesnwith what people would call,,sort of a rationalnconclusion to something.,And it concludes in somethingnthat you see here,,that you actually wouldn't expectnas being the result of rationality. 
 The second --,the second is that this processndoes not have a signature.,There is no authorship.,Architects are obsessed with authorship.,This is something that hasnediting and it has teams,,but in fact, we no longernsee within this process,,the traditional master architect,creating a sketchnthat his minions carry out. 
 And the third is that it challenges --,and this is, in the length of this,nvery hard to support why,,connect all these things --,but it challenges the high modernistnnotion of flexibility.,High modernists said we will creatensort of singular spaces that are generic,,almost anything can happen within them.,I call it sort of "shotgun flexibility" --,turn your head this way; shoot;nand you're bound to kill something.,So, this is the promise of high modernism:,within a single space, actually,nany kind of activity can happen.,But as we're seeing,,operational costs are startingnto dwarf capital costs,in terms of design parameters.,And so, with this sort of idea,,what happens is, whatever actuallynis in the building on opening day,,or whatever seems to benthe most immediate need,,starts to dwarf the possibilitynand sort of subsume it,,of anything else could ever happen.,And so we're proposingna different kind of flexibility,,something that we calln"compartmentalized flexibility.",And the idea is that you,nwithin that continuum,,identify a series of points,nand you design specifically to them.,They can be pushednoff-center a little bit,,but in the end you actuallynstill get as much,of that original spectrumnas you originally had hoped.,With high modernist flexibility,nthat doesn't really work. 
 Now I'm going to talk about --,I'm going to build upnthe Seattle Central Library,in this way before your eyesnin about five or six diagrams,,and I truly mean this is the designnprocess that you'll see.,With the library staffnand the library board,,we settled on two core positions.,This is the first one, and thisnis showing, over the last 900 years,,the evolution of the book,nand other technologies.,This diagram was our sortnof position piece about the book,,and our position was,nbooks are technology --,that's something people forget --,but it's a form of technologynthat will have to share its dominance,with any other form of truly potentntechnology or media. 
 The second premise --,and this was somethingnthat was very difficult for us,to convince the librarians of at first --,is that libraries, since the inceptionnof Carnegie Library tradition in America,,had a second responsibility,nand that was for social roles.,Ok, now, this I'll come backnto later, but something --,actually, the librarians at first said,n"No, this isn't our mandate.,Our mandate is media,nand particularly the book." 
 So what you're seeing nownis actually the design of the building.,The upper diagram is what we had seen,in a whole host of contemporary librariesnthat used high modernist flexibility.,Sort of, any activityncould happen anywhere.,We don't know the future of the library;nwe don't know the future of the book;,and so, we'll use this approach. 
 And what we saw were buildingsnthat were very generic, and worse --,not only were they very generic --,so, not only does the reading roomnlook like the copy room,look like the magazine area --,but it meant that whatever issuenwas troubling the library at that moment,was starting to engulf every othernactivity that was happening in it.,And in this case,nwhat was getting engulfed,were these social responsibilitiesnby the expansion of the book.,And so we proposednwhat's at the lower diagram.,Very dumb approach:nsimply compartmentalize.,Put those things whose evolutionnwe could predict --,and I don't mean that we could saynwhat would actually happen in the future,,but we have some certainty of the spectrumnof what would happen in the future --,put those in boxes designednspecifically for it,,and put the things that we can'tnpredict on the rooftops.,So that was the core idea. 
 Now, we had to convince the library,that social roles werenequally important to media,,in order to get them to accept this.,What you're seeing here is actuallyntheir program on the left.,That's as it was given to usnin all of its clarity and glory.,Our first operation was to re-digest itnback to them, show it to them and say,,"You know what? We haven't touched it,,but only one-third of your own programnis dedicated to media and books.,Two-thirds of it is already dedicated --,that's the white band below,nthe thing you said isn't important --,is already dedicated to social functions.",So once we had presentednthat back to them,,they agreed that this sortnof core concept could work.,We got the right to go backnto first principles --,that's the third diagram.,We recombined everything.,And then we started making new decisions. 
 What you're seeing on the rightnis the design of the library,,specifically in terms of square footage.,On the left of that diagram, here,nyou'll see a series of five platforms --,sort of combs, collective programs.,And on the right are the morenindeterminate spaces;,things like reading rooms,,whose evolution in 20, 30, 40 yearsnwe can't predict.,So that literally was the designnof the building.,They signed it, and to their chagrin,,we came back a week later,nand we presented them this.,And as you can see, it is literallynthe diagram on the right. 
 (Laughter) 
 We just sized -- no, really,nI mean that, literally.,The things on the left-hand sidenof the diagram,,those are the boxes.,We sized them into five compartments.nThey're super-efficient.,We had a very low budget to work with.,We pushed them around on the site,to make very literalncontextual relationships.,The reading roomnshould be able to see the water.,The main entrance should havena public plaza in front of it,to abide by the zoning code, and so forth. 
 So, you see the five platforms,nthose are the boxes.,within each one, a very discretenthing is happening.,The area in betweennis sort of an urban continuum,,these things that we can't predictntheir evolution to the same degree.,To give you some sensenof the power of this idea,,the biggest blocknis what we call the book spiral.,It's literally builtnin a very inexpensive way --,it is a parking garage for books.,It just so happens to be on the 6thnthrough 10th floors of the building,,but that is not necessarilynan expensive approach.,And it allows us to organizenthe entire Dewey Decimal System,on one continuous run; no matter how itngrows or contracts within the building,,it will always have its claritynto end the sort of trail of tears,that we've all experiencednin public libraries. 
 (Laughter) 
 And so this was the final operation,,which was to take these blocksnas they were all pushed off kilter,,and to hold onto them with a skin.,That skin serves double duty,nagain, for economics.,One, it is the lateral stabilitynfor the entire building;,it's a structural element.,But its dimensions were designednnot only for structure,,but also for holding onnevery piece of glass.,The glass was then --nI'll use the word impregnated --,but it had a layer of metalnthat was called "stretched metal.",That metal acts as a microlouver,,so from the exterior of the building,nthe sun sees it as totally opaque,,but from the interior,nit's entirely transparent. 
 So now I'm going to take younon a tour of the building.,Let me see if I can find it.,For anyone who getsnmotion sickness, I apologize.,So, this is the building.,And I think what's important is,nwhen we first unveiled the building,,the public saw it as beingntotally about our whim and ego.,And it was defended,nbelieve it or not, by the librarians.,They said, "Look,nwe don't know what it is,,but we know it's everythingnthat we need it to be,,based on the observationsnthat we've done about the program.",This is going into one of the entries.,So, it's an unusual buildingnfor a public library, obviously. 
 So now we're goingninto what we call the living room.,This is actually a programnthat we invented with the library.,It was recognizing that public libraries,are the last vestige of public free space.,There are plenty of shopping mallsnthat allow you to get out of the rain,in downtown Seattle,,but there are not so many free places,that allow you to get out of the rain.,So this was an unprogrammed area wherenpeople could pretty much do anything,,including eat, yell,nplay chess and so forth. 
 Now we're moving up into what we callnthe mixing chamber.,That was the mainntechnology area in the building.,You'll have to tell menif I'm going too fast for you.,And now up.,This is actually the placenthat we put into the building,so I could proposento my wife, right there. 
 (Laughter) 
 She said yes. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm running out of time,nso I'm actually going to stop.,I can show this to you later.,But let's see if I can very quicklynget into the book spiral,,because I think it's,nas I said, the most --,this is the main reading room --nthe most unique part of the building.,You dizzy yet?,Ok, so here, this is the book spiral.,So, it's very indiscernible,,but it's actuallyna continuous stair-stepping.,It allows you to, on one city block,,go up one full floor,nso that it's on a continuum. 
 Ok, now I'm going to go back,nand I'm going to hit a second project.,I'm going to go very,nvery quickly through this.,Now this is the Dallas Theater.,It was an unusual client for us,nbecause they came to us and they said,,"We need you to do a new building.,We've been workingnin a temporary space for 30 years,,but because of that temporary space,,we've become an infamous theater company.,Theater is really focused in New York,nChicago and Seattle,,with the exceptionnof the Dallas Theater Company.",And the very fact that they workednin a provisional space,meant that for Beckett,nthey could blow out a wall;,they could do "Cherry Orchard" and blowna hole through the floor, and so forth. 
 So it was a very daunting tasknfor us to do a brand-new building,that could be a pristine building,,but keep this kind of experimental nature.,And the second is,,they were what we callna multi-form theater,,they do different kindsnof performances in repertory.,So they in the morningnwill do something in arena,,then they'll do somethingnin proscenium and so forth.,And so they needed to be ablento quickly transform,between different theater organizations,,and for operational budget reasons,,this actually no longernhappens in pretty much,any multi-form theaternin the United States,,so we needed to figure outna way to overcome that. 
 So our thought was to literallynput the theater on its head:,to take those thingsnthat were previously defined,as front-of-house and back-of-house,and stack them above housenand below house,,and to create what we calledna theater machine.,We invest the moneynin the operation of the building.,It's almost as though the buildingncould be placed anywhere,,wherever you place it,,the area under it is chargednfor theatrical performances.,And it allowed us to go backnto first principles,,and redefine fly tower, acousticnenclosure, light enclosure and so forth.,And at the push of a button,,it allows the artistic directornto move between proscenium, thrust,,and in fact, arenanand traverse and flat floor,,in a very quick transfiguration. 
 So in fact, usingnoperational budget, we can --,sorry, capital cost --nwe can actually achieve,what was no longer achievablenin operational cost.,And that means that the artistic director,now has a palette that he or shencan choose from,,between a series of formsnand a series of processions,,because that enclosure around the theaternthat is normally trapped,with front-of-house and back-of-housenspaces has been liberated.,So an artistic director has the abilitynto have a performance,that enters in a Wagnerian procession,,shows the first act in thrust,,the intermission in a Greek procession,,second act in arena, and so forth. 
 So I'm going to show younwhat this actually means.,This is the theater up close.,Any portion around the theaternactually can be opened discretely.,The light enclosure can be liftednseparate to the acoustic enclosure,,so you can do Beckettnwith Dallas as the backdrop.,Portions can be opened,,so you can now actually have motorcyclesndrive directly into the performance,,or you can even just havenan open-air performance,,or for intermissions.,The balconies all move to gonbetween those configurations,,but they also disappear.,The proscenium line can also disappear.,You can bring enormous objects in,,so in fact, the Dallas Theater Company --,their first show will be a playnabout Charles Lindbergh,,and they'll want to bring inna real aircraft.,And then it also provides them,nin the off-season,,the ability to actually rent outntheir space for entirely different things.,This is it from a distance.,Open up entire portionsnfor different kinds of events.,And at night.,Again, remove the light enclosure;nkeep the acoustic enclosure.,This is a monster truck show. 
 I'm going to show now the last project.,This also is an unusual client.,They inverted the whole ideanof development.,They came to us and they said --nunlike normal developers --,they said, "We want to start out,by providing a contemporarynart museum in Louisville.,That's our main goal.",And so instead of being a developernthat sees an opportunity to make money,,they saw an ability to bena catalyst in their downtown.,And the fact that they wanted to supportnthe contemporary art museum,actually built their pro forma,,so they worked in reverse.,And that pro forma led us,to a mixed-use buildingnthat was very large,,in order to supportntheir aspirations of the art,,but it also opened up opportunitiesnfor the art itself,to collaborate, interactnwith commercial spaces,that actually artists morenand more want to work within.,And it also charged usnwith thinking about how to have,something that was both a single building,and a credible sort of sub-building. 
 So this is Louisville's skyline,,and I'm going to takenyou through the various constraints,that led to the project.,First: the physical constraints.,We actually had to operatenon three discrete sites,,all of them well smallernthan the size of the building.,We had to operate next to the newnMuhammad Ali Center, and respect it.,We had to operatenwithin the 100-year floodplain.,Now, this area floodsnthree to four times a year,,and there's a levee behind our site,,similar to the onesnthat broke in New Orleans.,Had to operate behind the I-64 corridor,,a street that cuts through the middlenof these separate sites.,So we're starting to build a sort ofnnightmare of constraints in a bathtub.,Underneath the bathtubnare the city's main power lines.,And there is a pedestrian corridornthat they wanted to add,,that would link a seriesnof cultural buildings,,and a view corridor --nbecause this is the historic district --,that they didn't want to obstructnwith a new building. 
 (Laughter) 
 And now we're going to addn1.1 million square feet.,And if we did the traditional thing,nthat 1.1 million square feet --,these are the different programs --,the traditional thing would be to identifynthe public elements, place them on sites,,and now we'd have a reallynterrible situation:,a public thing in the middlenof a bathtub that floods.,And then we would sizenall the other elements --,the different commercial elements:,hotel, luxury housing,noffices and so forth --,and dump it on top.,And we would creatensomething that was unviable.,In fact -- and you know this -- thisnis called the Time Warner Building. 
 (Laughter) 
 So our strategy was very simple.,Just lift the entire block,,flip some of the elements over,,reposition themnso they have appropriate views,and relationships to downtown,,and make circulation connectionsnand reroute the road.,So that's the basic concept,,and now I'm going to show younwhat it leads to. 
 Ok, it seems a very formal,nwillful gesture,,but something derived entirelynout of the constraints.,And again, when we unveiled it,nthere was a sort of nervousness,that this was about an architectnmaking a statement,,not an architect who was attemptingnto solve a series of problems.,Now, within that center zone, as I said,,we have the ability to mixna series of things.,So here, this is sort of an x-ray --,the towers are totally developer-driven.,They told us the dimensions,nthe sizes and so forth,,and we focused on takingnall the public components --,the lobbies, the bars --,everything that different commercialnelements would have,,and combined it in the center,nin the sort of subway map,,in the transfer zone that would alsoninclude the contemporary art museum. 
 So it creates a situation like this,nwhere you have artists who can operate,within an art space that also hasnan amazing view on the 22nd floor,,but it also has proximity that the curatorncan either open or close.,It allows peoplenon exercise bicycles to be seen,,or to see the art, and so forth.,It also means that if an artist wantsnto invade something like a swimming pool,,they can begin to do their exhibitionnin a swimming pool,,so they're not forced to alwaysnwork within the confines,of a contemporary gallery space. 
 So, how to build this.,It's very simple: it's a chair.,So, we begin by building the cores.,As we're building the cores, we buildnthe contemporary art museum at grade.,That allows us to havenincredible efficiency and cost efficiency.,This is not a high-budget building.,The moment the cores get to mid level,,we finish the art museum; we putnall the mechanical equipment in it;,and then we jack it up into the air.,This is how they buildnreally large aircraft hangars,,for instance, the onesnthat they did for the A380.,Finish the cores, finish the meat,and you get somethingnthat looks like this. 
 Now I only have about 30 seconds,,so I want to start an animation,,and we'll conclude with that. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)

 [redirect 7th street]I'm the luckiest guy in the world.,I got to see the last casenof killer smallpox in the world.,I was in India this past year,,and I may have seennthe last cases of polio in the world.,There's nothing that makesnyou feel more --,the blessing and the honornof working in a program like that --,than to know that somethingnthat horrible no longer exists.,So I'm going to tell you --,(Applause),so I'm going to show younsome dirty pictures.,They are difficult to watch,nbut you should look at them with optimism,,because the horrornof these pictures will be matched,by the uplifting quality of knowingnthat they no longer exist. 
 But first, I'm going to tell youna little bit about my own journey.,My background is not exactlynthe conventional medical education,that you might expect.,When I was an intern in San Francisco,,I heard about a group of Native Americansnwho had taken over Alcatraz Island,,and a Native Americannwho wanted to give birth on that island,,and no other doctor wantednto go and help her give birth.,I went out to Alcatraz, and I livednon the island for several weeks.,She gave birth; I caughtnthe baby; I got off the island;,I landed in San Francisco;,and all the press wanted to talk to me,,because my three weeks on the islandnmade me an expert in Indian affairs.,(Laughter) 
 I wound up on every television show.,Someone saw me on television;nthey called me up; and they asked me,if I'd like to be in a movienand to play a young doctor,for a bunch of rock and roll starsnwho were traveling in a bus ride,from San Francisco to England.,And I said, yes, I would do that,,so I became the doctornin an absolutely awful movie,called "Medicine Ball Caravan.",(Laughter),Now, you know from the '60s,,you're either on the busnor you're off the bus; I was on the bus.,My wife of 37 years and I joined the bus.,Our bus ride took usnfrom San Francisco to London,,then we switched buses at the big pond.,We then got on two more buses,and we drove through Turkeynand Iran, Afghanistan,,over the Khyber Pass into Pakistan,nlike every other young doctor.,This is us at the Khyber Pass,nand that's our bus.,We had some difficulty gettingnover the Khyber Pass.,But we wound up in India.,And then, like everyone elsenin our generation,,we went to live in a Himalayan monastery. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is just like a residency program,,for those of younthat are in medical school.,(Laughter),And we studied with a wise man,na guru named Karoli Baba,,who then told me to get rid of the dress,,put on a three-piece suit,,go join the United Nations as a diplomat,and work for the WorldnHealth Organization.,And he made an outrageous predictionnthat smallpox would be eradicated,,and that this was God's gift to humanity,,because of the hard worknof dedicated scientists.,And that prediction came true.,This little girl is Rahima Banu,,and she was the last casenof killer smallpox in the world.,And this document is the certificatenthat the global commission signed,,certifying the world to have eradicatednthe first disease in history. 
 The key to eradicating smallpoxnwas early detection, early response.,I'm going to ask you to repeat that:nearly detection, early response.,Can you say that? 
 Audience: Early detection, early response. 
 Larry Brilliant: Smallpoxnwas the worst disease in history.,It killed more peoplenthan all the wars in history.,In the last century,nit killed 500 million people.,You're reading about Larry Page already.,Somebody reads very fast.,(Laughter),In the year that Larry Pagenand Sergey Brin --,with whom I have a certain affectionnand a new affiliation --,in the year in which they were born,,two million people died of smallpox.,We declared smallpox eradicated in 1980.,This is the most important slidenthat I've ever seen in public health,,[Sovereigns killed by smallpox]nbecause it shows you,to be the richest and the strongest,,and to be kings and queens of the world,,did not protect younfrom dying of smallpox.,Never can you doubtnthat we are all in this together. 
 But to see smallpoxnfrom the perspective of a sovereign,is the wrong perspective.,You should see itnfrom the perspective of a mother,,watching her child developnthis disease and standing by helplessly.,Day one, day two, day three,,day four, day five, day six.,You're a mother and you'renwatching your child,,and on day six, you seenpustules that become hard.,Day seven, they show the classic scarsnof smallpox umbilication.,Day eight. 
 And Al Gore said earlier,that the most photographednimage in the world,,the most printed image in the world,,was that of the Earth.,But this was in 1974,nand as of that moment,,this photograph was the photographnthat was the most widely printed,,because we printed two billion copiesnof this photograph,,and we took themnhand to hand, door to door,,to show people and ask themnif there was smallpox in their house,,because that was our surveillance system.,We didn't have Google,nwe didn't have web crawlers,,we didn't have computers. 
 By day nine -- you look at this picturenand you're horrified;,I look at this picturenand I say, "Thank God,",because it's clear that this is onlynan ordinary case of smallpox,,and I know this child will live.,And by day 13, the lesionsnare scabbing, his eyelids are swollen,,but you know this child hasnno other secondary infection.,And by day 20, while he will benscarred for life, he will live. 
 There are other kinds of smallpoxnthat are not like that.,This is confluent smallpox,,in which there isn't a single placenon the body where you could put a finger,and not be covered by lesions.,Flat smallpox, which killed 100 percentnof people who got it.,And hemorrhagic smallpox,nthe most cruel of all,,which had a predilectionnfor pregnant women.,I've probably had 50 women die.,They all had hemorrhagic smallpox.,I've never seen anybody die from itnwho wasn't a pregnant woman. 
 In 1967, the WHO embarkednon what was an outrageous program,to eradicate a disease.,In that year, there were 34 countriesnaffected with smallpox.,By 1970, we were down to 18 countries.,1974, we were down to five countries.,But in that year,nsmallpox exploded throughout India.,And India was the placenwhere smallpox made its last stand.,In 1974, India hadna population of 600 million.,There are 21 linguistic states in India,,which is like sayingn21 different countries.,There are 20 million peoplenon the road at any time,,in buses and trains, walking;n500,000 villages, 120 million households,,and none of them wanted to report,if they had a casenof smallpox in their house,,because they thought that smallpoxnwas the visitation of a deity,,Shitala Mata, the cooling mother,,and it was wrong to bringnstrangers into your house,when the deity was in the house.,No incentive to report smallpox. 
 It wasn't just Indianthat had smallpox deities;,smallpox deities werenprevalent all over the world.,So, how we eradicated smallpox was --,mass vaccination wouldn't work.,You could vaccinate everybody in India,,but one year later there'd ben21 million new babies,,which was then the population of Canada.,It wouldn't do just to vaccinate everyone.,You had to find every singlencase of smallpox in the world,at the same time, and drawna circle of immunity around it.,And that's what we did.,In India alone, my 150,000 best friendsnand I went door to door,,with that same picture,,to every single house in India.,We made over one billion house calls. 
 And in the process,nI learned something very important.,Every time we did a house-to-house search,,we had a spike in the numbernof reports of smallpox.,When we didn't search, we hadnthe illusion that there was no disease.,When we did search, we had the illusionnthat there was more disease.,A surveillance system was necessary,,because what we needednwas early detection, early response.,So we searched and we searched,,and we found every casenof smallpox in India.,We had a reward. We raised the reward.,We continued to increase the reward.,We had a scorecardnthat we wrote on every house.,And as we did that,,the number of reported casesnin the world dropped to zero.,And in 1980, we declared the globenfree of smallpox. 
 It was the largest campaignnin United Nations history,,until the Iraq war.,150,000 people from all over the world --,doctors of every race,nreligion, culture and nation,,who fought side by side,nbrothers and sisters,,with each other, not against each other,,in a common causento make the world better.,But smallpox was the fourth diseasenthat was intended for eradication.,We failed three other times.,We failed against malaria,nyellow fever and yaws.,But soon we may see polio eradicated.,But the key to eradicating polionis early detection, early response.,This may be the year we eradicate polio.,That will make itnthe second disease in history.,And David Heymann, who's watchingnthis on the webcast --,David, keep on going. We're close!,We're down to four countries. 
 (Applause) 
 I feel like Hank Aaron.,Barry Bonds can replace me any time. 
 Let's get another disease off the listnof terrible things to worry about.,I was just in India working onnthe polio program.,The polio surveillance programnis four million people going door to door.,That is the surveillance system.,But we need to havenearly detection, early response.,Blindness, the same thing.,The key to discovering blindnessnis doing epidemiological surveys,and finding out the causes of blindness,,so you can mount the correct response. 
 The Seva Foundationnwas started by a group of alumni,of the Smallpox Eradication Programme,,who, having climbed the highest mountain,,tasted the elixir of the successnof eradicating a disease,,wanted to do it again.,And over the last 27 years,nSeva's programs in 15 countries,have given back sightnto more than two million blind people.,Seva got started because we wantednto apply these lessons,of surveillance and epidemiology,to something which nobody elsenwas looking at as a public health issue:,blindness, which heretofore had beennthought of only as a clinical disease. 
 In 1980, Steve Jobs gave menthat computer, which is Apple number 12,,and it's still in Kathmandu,nand it's still working,,and we ought to go get it and auctionnit off and make more money for Seva.,And we conducted the first Nepal surveynever done for health,,and the first nationwidenblindness survey ever done,,and we had astonishing results.,Instead of finding outnwhat we thought was the case --,that blindness was caused mostlynby glaucoma and trachoma --,we were astounded to find out,that blindness was causedninstead by cataract.,You can't cure or preventnwhat you don't know is there. 
 In your TED packagesnthere's a DVD, "Infinite Vision,",about Dr. V and the Aravind Eye Hospital.,I hope that you will take a look at it.,Aravind, which started as a Seva project,,is now the world's largestnand best eye hospital.,This year, that one hospitalnwill give back sight,to more than 300,000 peoplenin Tamil Nadu, India.,(Applause),Bird flu.,I stand here as a representativenof all terrible things --,this might be the worst.,The key to preventingnor mitigating pandemic bird flu,is early detection and rapid response.,We will not have a vaccinenor adequate supplies of an antiviral,to combat bird flu if it occursnin the next three years.,WHO stages the progress of a pandemic.,We are now at stage threenon the pandemic alert stage,,with just a little bitnof human-to-human transmission,,but no human-to-human-to-humannsustained transmission. 
 The moment WHO saysnwe've moved to category four --,this will not be like Katrina.,The world as we know it will stop.,There'll be no airplanes flying.,Would you get in an airplanenwith 250 people you didn't know,,coughing and sneezing,,when you knew that some of themnmight carry a disease that could kill you,,for which you hadnno antivirals or vaccine?,I did a study of the top epidemiologistsnin the world in October.,I asked them -- these are all fluologistsnand specialists in influenza --,and I asked them the questionsnyou'd like to ask them:,What do you think the likelihoodnis that there'll be a pandemic?,If it happens, how badndo you think it will be? 
 Fifteen percent said they thoughtnthere'd be a pandemic within three years.,But much worse than that,,90 percent said they thoughtnthere'd be a pandemic,within your childrennor your grandchildren's lifetime.,And they thoughtnthat if there was a pandemic,,a billion people would get sick.,As many as 165 million people would die.,There would be a globalnrecession and depression,as our just-in-time inventory system,and the tight rubber bandnof globalization broke,,and the cost to our economynof one to three trillion dollars,would be far worse for everyonenthan merely 100 million people dying,,because so many more peoplenwould lose their job,and their healthcare benefits,,that the consequencesnare almost unthinkable.,And it's getting worse,nbecause travel is getting so much better. 
 Let me show you a simulationnof what a pandemic looks like.,So we know what we're talking about.,Let's assume, for example,nthat the first case occurs in South Asia.,It initially goes quite slowly.,You get two or three discrete locations.,Then there'll be secondary outbreaks,nand the disease will spread,from country to country so fastnthat you won't know what hit you.,Within three weeksnit will be everywhere in the world.,Now, if we had an "undo" button,nand we could go back and isolate it,and grab it when it first started --nif we could find it early,,and we had early detectionnand early response,,and we could put each onenof those viruses in jail --,that's the only way to deal withnsomething like a pandemic.,And let me show you why that is. 
 We have a joke.,This is an epidemic curve,nand everyone in medicine,,I think, ultimately getsnto know what it is.,But the joke is,,an epidemiologist likes to arrivenat an epidemic right here,and ride to glory on the downhill curve.,(Laughter),But you don't get to do that usually.,You usually arrive right about here.,What we really want is to arrivenright here, so we can stop the epidemic.,But you can't always do that.,But there's an organizationnthat has been able to find a way,to learn when the first cases occur,,and that is called GPHIN;,it's the Global Public HealthnInformation Network.,And that simulation that I showed you,that you thoughtnwas bird flu -- that was SARS.,And SARS is the pandemicnthat did not occur.,And it didn't occur,because GPHIN foundnthe pandemic-to-be of SARS,three months before WHO actuallynannounced it, and because of that,,we were able to stop the SARS pandemic.,And I think we owena great debt of gratitude,to GPHIN and to Ron St. John,,who I hope is in the audiencensome place -- over there --,who's the founder of GPHIN. 
 (Applause) 
 Hello, Ron! 
 (Applause) 
 And TED has flown Ron herenfrom Ottawa, where GPHIN is located,,because not onlyndid GPHIN find SARS early,,but you may have seen last week,that Iran announcednthat they had bird flu in Iran,,but GPHIN found the bird flunin Iran not February 14 --,but last September.,We need an early-warning system,to protect us against the thingsnthat are humanity's worst nightmare.,And so my TED wish is based onnthe common denominator,of these experiences.,Smallpox -- early detection,nearly response.,Blindness, polio --nearly detection, early response.,Pandemic bird flu --nearly detection, early response.,It is a litany.,It is so obvious that our only waynof dealing with these new diseases,is to find them earlynand to kill them before they spread. 
 So, my TED wish is for younto help build a global system --,an early-warning system --,to protect us againstnhumanity's worst nightmares.,And what I thought I would call itnis "Early Detection,",But it should really be called ...,"Total Early Detection."n[TED] 
 (Laughter),What? 
 (Applause),What?,(Applause) 
 But in all seriousness,,because this idea is birthed in TED,,I would like it to bena legacy of TED, and I'd like to call it,the "International System for TotalnEarly Disease Detection.",[INSTEDD],And INSTEDD then becomes our mantra.,So instead of a hiddennpandemic of bird flu,,we find it and immediately contain it.,Instead of a novel virusncaused by bio-terror or bio-error,,or shift or drift,nwe find it and we contain it.,Instead of industrialnaccidents like oil spills,or the catastrophe in Bhopal,,we find them, and we respond to them.,Instead of famine,nhidden until it is too late,,we detect it, and we respond.,And instead of a systemnwhich is owned by a government,,and hidden in the bowels of government,,let's build an early detection system,that's freely available to anyonenin the world in their own language. 
 Let's make it transparent,nnon-governmental,,not owned by any singlencountry or company,,housed in a neutral country,nwith redundant backup,in a different time zonenand a different continent.,And let's build it on GPHIN.,Let's start with GPHIN.,Let's increase the websitesnthat they crawl,from 20,000 to 20 million.,Let's increase the languages they crawl,from seven to 70, or more.,Let's build in outboundnconfirmation messages,,using text messages or SMSnor instant messaging,to find out from peoplenwho are within 100 meters,of the rumor that you hear,,if it is, in fact, valid.,And let's add satellite confirmation.,And we'll add Gapminder'snamazing graphics to the front end. 
 And we'll grow itnas a moral force in the world,,finding out those terrible things,before anybody else knows about them,,and sending our response to them,,so that next year,ninstead of us meeting here,,lamenting how many terrible thingsnthere are in the world,,we will have pulled together,,used the unique skillsnand the magic of this community,,and be proud that we have doneneverything we can to stop pandemics,,other catastrophes, and changenthe world, beginning right now. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: An amazing presentation.,First of all, just soneveryone understands:,you're saying thatnby creating web crawlers,,looking on the Internet for patterns,,they can detect something suspicious,before WHO, before anyone else can see it?,Give an example of hownthat could possibly be true. 
 Larry Brilliant: You're not madnabout the copyright violation? 
 CA: No. I love it. 
 (Laughter) 
 LB: Well, as Ron St. John --,I hope you'll go and meet himnin the dinner afterwards and talk to him.,When he started GPHIN --,In 1997, there was an outbreaknof bird flu -- H5N1.,It was in Hong Kong.,And a remarkable doctor in Hong Kongnresponded immediately,,by slaughtering 1.5 millionnchickens and birds,,and they stoppednthat outbreak in its tracks.,Immediate detection, immediate response.,Then a number of years went by,,and there were a lotnof rumors about bird flu.,Ron and his team in Ottawanbegan to crawl the web --,only crawling 20,000 different websites,nmostly periodicals --,and they read aboutnand heard about a concern,,of a lot of children who had high fevernand symptoms of bird flu. 
 They reported this to WHO. 
 WHO took a little while taking action,,because WHO will only receivena report from a government,,because it's the United Nations.,But they were able to pointnto WHO and let them know,that there was this surprisingnand unexplained cluster of illnesses,that looked like bird flu.,That turned out to be SARS.,That's how the world found out about SARS.,And because of that,nwe were able to stop SARS.,Now, what's really important is that,nbefore there was GPHIN,,100 percent of all the world'snreports of bad things --,whether you're talking about famine,or you're talking about bird flunor you're talking about Ebola --,100 percent of all those reportsncame from nations. 
 The moment these guys in Ottawa --,on a budget of 800,000 dollarsna year -- got cracking,,75 percent of all the reportsnin the world came from GPHIN,,25 percent of all the reports in the world,came from all the other 180 nations.,Now, here's what's really interesting:,after they'd been workingnfor a couple years,,what do you think happenednto those nations?,They felt pretty stupid.,So they started sending inntheir reports early.,And now, their reporting percentagenis down to 50 percent,,because other nationsnhave started to report.,So, can you find diseasesnearly by crawling the web?,Of course you can.,Can you find it even earliernthan GPHIN does now?,Of course you can.,You saw that they found SARSnusing their Chinese web crawler,a full six weeks before they found itnusing their English web crawler.,Well, they're only crawlingnin seven languages.,These bad viruses reallyndon't have any intention,of showing up first in Englishnor Spanish or French. 
 (Laughter) 
 So yes, I want to take GPHIN,nI want to build on it.,I want to add all the languagesnof the world that we possibly can.,I want to make this open to everybody,,so that the health officernin Nairobi or in Patna, Bihar,will have as much access to itnas the folks in Ottawa or in CDC.,And I want to make it part of our culture,that there is a community of peoplenwho are watching out,for the worst nightmares of humanity,,and that it's accessible to everyone.Over the past couple of days,,as I've been preparing for my speech,,I've become more and more nervousnabout what I'm going to say,and about being on the same stagenas all these fascinating people.,Being on the same stage as Al Gore,nwho was the first person I ever voted for.,And -- 
 (Laughter) 
 So I was getting pretty nervous,and, you know, I didn't knownthat Chris sits on the stage,,and that's more nerve-racking.,But then I started thinkingnabout my family.,I started thinking about my fathernand my grandfather,and my great-grandfather,,and I realized,that I had all of these Tedsngoing through my bloodstream -- 
 (Laughter) 
 that I had to consider this "my element." 
 So, who am I?,Chris kind of mentioned I startedna company with my husband.,We have about 125 people internationally.,If you looked in the book,,you saw this ... 
 (Laughter) 
 which I really was appalled by. 
 (Laughter) 
 And because I wantednto impress you all with slides,,since I saw the great presentationsnyesterday with graphs,,I made a graph that moves,,and I talk about the makeup of me. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, besides this freakish thing,,this is my science slide.,This is math, and this is science,nthis is genetics.,This is my grandmother,nand this is where I get this mouth. 
 (Laughter) 
 So --,I'm a blogger, which, probably,nto a lot of you, means different things.,You may have heardnabout the Kryptonite lock brouhaha,,where a blogger talked about how you hack,or break into a Kryptonitenlock using a ballpoint pen,,and it spread all over.,Kryptonite had to adjust the lock,,and they had to address itnto avoid too many customer concerns.,You may have heard about Rathergate,,which was basically the result of bloggers,realizing that the "th" in 111,is not typeset on an old typewriter;,it's on Word.,Bloggers exposed this,,or they worked hard to expose this.,You know, blogs are scary.nThis is what you see.,I see this, and I'm sure scared --nI swear on stage -- shitless about blogs,,because this is notnsomething that's friendly.,But there are blogs that are changingnthe way we read news,and consume media,nand these are great examples.,These people are reaching thousands,,if not millions, of readers,,and that's incredibly important.,During the hurricane,,you had MSNBC postingnabout the hurricane on their blog,,updating it frequently.,This was possible because of the easynnature of blogging tools. 
 You have my friend,,who has a blog on PVRs,npersonal recorders.,He makes enough money just by running ads,,to support his family up in Oregon.,That's all he does now,,and this is somethingnthat blogs have made possible.,And then you have somethingnlike this, which is Interplast.,It's a wonderful organization,of people and doctorsnwho go to developing nations,to offer plastic surgerynto those who need it.,Children with cleft palates get it,nand they document their story.,This is wonderful.,I am not that caring. 
 (Laughter) 
 I talk about myself.,That's what I am. I'm a blogger.,I have always decided that I was goingnto be an expert on one thing,,and I am an expert on this person,,and so I write about it.,So, the short story about my blog:,it started in 2001, I was 23.,I wasn't happy with my job,,because I was a designer,,but I wasn't being really stimulated.,I was an English major in college.,I didn't have any use for it,nbut I missed writing.,So, I started to write a blog,and I started to create thingsnlike these little stories.,This was an illustration about my campnexperience when I was 11 years old,,and how I went to a YMCA camp,nChristian camp,,and basically by the end,,I had made my friends hate me so muchnthat I hid in a bunk,,They couldn't find me,nthey sent a search party,,and I overheard people sayingnthey wish I had killed myself --,jumped off Bible Peak. 
 You can laugh, this is OK. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is me.,This is what happened to me.,And when I started my blog,nit was really this one goal --,I said, "I am not goingnto be famous to the world,,but I could be famousnto people on the Internet.",And I set a goal.,I said, "I'm going to win an award,",because I had never wonnan award in my entire life.,And I said, "I'm going to winnthe South by Southwest Weblog award.",And I won it -- I reachednall of these people,,and I had tens of thousands of peoplenreading about my life every day. 
 And then I wrote a post about a banjo.,I wrote a post,about wanting to buy a banjo --,a $300 banjo, which is a lot of money.,And I don't play instruments;,I don't know anything about music.,I like music, and I like banjos,,and I think I probably heardnSteve Martin playing,,and I said, "I could do that.",And I said to my husband,,"Ben, can I buy a banjo?"nAnd he's like, "No." 
 And my husband -- 
 (Laughter) 
 this is my husband, who is very hot --,he won an award for being hot. 
 (Laughter) 
 He told me,,"You cannot buy a banjo.,You're just like your dad,"nwho collects instruments.,And I wrote a postnabout how I was so mad at him,,he was such a tyrant --nhe would not let me buy this banjo.,And those people who know menunderstood my joke --,this is Mena, this is hownI make a joke at people.,Because the joke in thisnis that this person is not a tyrant,,this person is so loving and so sweet,that he lets me dress him up,and post pictures of him to my blog. 
 (Laughter) 
 And if he knew I was showingnthis right now -- I put this in today --,he would kill me. 
 But the thing was, my friends read it,,and they're like, "Oh, that Mena,nshe wrote a post,about wanting a stupid thingnand being stupid.",But I got emails from people that said,,"Oh my God, your husbandnis such an asshole.,How much money doesnhe spend on beer in a year?,You could take that moneynand buy your banjo.,Why don't you open a separate account?",I've been with him since I was 17,nwe've never had a separate bank account.,They said, "Separate your bank account.,Spend your money;nspend his money, that's it.",And then I got people saying, "Leave him." 
 (Laughter) 
 I was like, "OK, what?nWho are these people?,And why are they reading this?",And I realized: I don'tnwant to reach these people.,I don't want to writenfor this public audience.,And I started to kill my blog slowly.,I'm like, I don't wantnto write this anymore.,Slowly and slowly -- 
 And I did tell personalnstories from time to time.,I wrote this one, and I put thisnup because of Einstein today.,I'm going to get choked up,nbecause this is my first pet,,and she passed away two years ago.,And I decided to break from, "I don'tnreally write about my public life,",because I wanted to give herna little memorial.,But anyways, it's these sortsnof personal stories --,You know, you read the blogsnabout politics or about media,,and gossip and all these things.,These are out there,,but it's more of the personalnthat interests me,,and this is who I am. 
 You see Norman Rockwell,nand you have art critics say,,"Norman Rockwell is not art.,Norman Rockwell hangsnin living rooms and bathrooms,,and this is not somethingnto be considered high art.",And I think this is onenof the most important things,to us as humans.,These things resonate with us,,and, if you think about blogs,nyou think of high art blogs,,the history paintings about,nyou know, all the biblical stories,,and then you have this.,These are the blogs that interest me:nthe people that just tell stories. 
 One story is about this baby,nand his name is Odin.,His father was a blogger.,And he was writing his blog one day,,and his wife gave birth to her baby,at 25 weeks.,And he never expected this.,One day, it was normal;nthe next day, it was hell.,And this is a one-pound baby.,So Odin was documented every single day. 
 Pictures were taken every day:nday one, day two ...,You have day nine --nthey're talking about his apnea;,day 39 -- he gets pneumonia.,His baby is so small,,and I've never encountered such a --,just -- a disturbing image,nbut just so heartfelt.,And you're reading this as it happens,,so on day 55, everybody readsnthat he's having failures:,breathing failures and heart failures,,and it's slowing down,nand you don't know what to expect. 
 But then it gets better.nDay 96, he goes home.,And you see this post.,That's not something you're goingnto see in a paper or magazine,but this is something this person feels,,and people are excitednabout it -- 28 comments.,That's not a huge amountnof people reading,,but 28 people matter.,And today, he is a healthy baby,,who, if you read his blog --,it's snowdeal.org, his father's blog --,he is taking pictures of him still,nbecause he is still his son,and he is, I think,nat his age level right now,because he had received suchngreat treatment from the hospital. 
 So, blogs.,So what? You've probablynheard these things before.,We talked about the WELL,nand about all these sorts of things,throughout our online history.,But I think blogs are basicallynjust an evolution,,and that's where we are today.,It's this recordnof who you are, your persona.,You have your Google search,nwhere you say, "What is Mena Trott?",And then you find these thingsnand you're happy or unhappy.,But then you also find people's blogs,,and those are the records of peoplenthat are writing daily --,not necessarily about the same topic,nbut things that interest them.,And we talk about the worldnflattens, being in this panel,,and I am very optimistic --nwhenever I think about blogs,,I'm like, "We've got to reachnall these people.",Hundreds of millionsnand billions of people.,We're getting into China,nwe want to be there,,but there are so many people thatnwon't have the access to write a blog.,But to see somethingnlike the $100 computer is amazing,,because blogging software is simple.,We have a successful companynbecause of timing,,and because of perseverance,nbut it's simple stuff --,it's not rocket science.,And so, that's an amazingnthing to consider.,So --,the life record of a blog is somethingnthat I find incredibly important. 
 And we started with a slide of my Teds,,and I had to add this slide,,because I knew the minutenI showed this, my mom --,my mom will see this,nbecause she does read my blog,and she'll say, "Why wasn't therena picture of me?",This is my mom.,So, I have all the people that I know of.,But this is basically the extentnof the family that I know,in terms of my direct line.,I showed a Norman Rockwell paintingnbefore, and this one, I grew up with,,looking at constantly.,I would spend hoursnlooking at the connections,,saying, "Oh, the little kidnup at the top has red hair;,so does that first generation up there.",And it's just these little things.,This is not science,nbut this was enough for me,to be really interestednin how we have evolved,and how we can trace our line.,So that has always influenced me. 
 I have this record, this 1910 census,,of another Grabowski --nthat's my maiden name --,and there's a Theodore,nbecause there's always a Theodore.,This is all I have,na couple of facts about somebody.,I have their date of birth, their age,nwhat they did in their household,,if they spoke English,,and that's it, that's all I knownof these people.,And it's pretty sad,,because I only go backnfive generations, and that's it.,I don't even know what happensnon my mom's side,,because she's from Cubanand I don't have that many things.,Just doing this,nI spent time in the archives --,that's why my husband's a saint --,I spent time in the Washington archives,,just sitting there,nlooking for these things.,Now it's online, but he sat through that. 
 And so you have this record and --,This is my great-great-grandmother.,This is the only picture I have.,And to think of what we have the abilitynto do with our blogs;,to think about the peoplenthat are on those $100 computers,,talking about who they are,nsharing these personal stories --,this is an amazing thing. 
 Another photo that hasngreatly influenced me,,or a series of photos, is this project,that's done by an Argentineannman and his wife.,And he's basically taking a picturenof his family every day,for the past, what is '76? -- 20 ...nOh my God, I'm '77 -- 29 years?,Twenty-nine years. 
 There was a joke, originally,nabout my graph that I left out, which is:,You see all this math?,I'm just happy I was ablento add it up to 100,,because that's my skill set. 
 (Laughter) 
 So you have these people aging,,and now this is them today, or last year.,And that's a powerful thingnto have, to be able to track this.,I wish that I would haventhis of my family.,I know that one day my childrennwill be wondering --,or my grandchildren,nor my great-grandchildren,,if I ever have children --,what I am going to --,who I was.,So I do somethingnthat's very narcissistic -- 
 I am a blogger --,that is an amazing thing for me,,because it capturesna moment in time every day.,I take a picture of myself --nI've been doing this since last year --,every single day.,And, you know, it's the same picture;,it's basically the same person. 
 Only a couple of people read it.,I don't write this for this audience;,I'm showing it now, but I would goninsane if this was really public.,About four people probably read it,,and they tell me, "You haven't updated.",I'm probably going to get peoplentelling me I haven't updated.,But this is amazing, because I canngo back to a day -- to April 2005,,and say, what was I doing this day?,I look at it, I know exactly.,It's this visual cuenthat is so important to what we do.,I put the bad pictures up too,,because there are bad pictures. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I remember instantly:nI am in Germany in this --,I had to go for a one-day trip.,I was sick, and I was in a hotel room,,and I wanted not to be there.,And so you see these things,nit's not just always smiling.,Now I've kind of evolved it,nso I have this look.,If you look at my driver's license,nI have the same look,,and it's a pretty disturbing thing,,but it's somethingnthat is really important. 
 And the last storynI really want to tell is this story,,because this is probably the onenthat means the most to me,in all of what I'm doing.,I'll probably get choked up,nbecause I tend to when I talk about this.,So, this woman, her name was Emma,,and she was a bloggernon our service, TypePad.,And she was a beta tester,nso she was there right when we opened --,you know, there was 100 people.,And she wrote about her lifendealing with cancer.,She was writing and writing,nand we all started reading it,,because we hadnso few blogs on the service,,we could keep track of everyone. 
 And she was writing one day,,and then she disappeared for a little bit.,And her sister came on, and she saidnthat Emma had passed away.,And all of our support staff who hadntalked to her were really emotional,,and it was a very hard day at the company. 
 And this was one of thoseninstances where I realized,how much bloggingnaffects our relationship,,and flattening this sort of world.,That this woman is in England,,and she lives -- she lived -- a life,where she was talkingnabout what she was doing.,But the big thingnthat really influenced us was,,her sister wrote to me, and she said --,and she wrote on this blog --,that writing her blog duringnthe last couple of months of her life,was probably the best thingnthat had happened to her,,and being able to talk to peoplenand to share what was going on,,and being able to writenand receive comments.,And that was amazing,,to be able to knownthat we had empowered that,,and that blogging was somethingnthat she felt comfortable doing,,and the idea that bloggingndoesn't have to be scary,,that we don't always havento be attack of the blogs,,that we can be people who are open,nand wanting to help and talk to people.,That was an amazing thing. 
 And so I printed out and sentna PDF of her blog to her family,,and they passed itnout at her memorial service,,and even in her obituary,nthey mentioned her blog,,because it was suchna big part of her life.,And that's a huge thing. 
 So, this is her legacy,,and I think that my call to actionnto all of you is:,think about blogs,nthink about what they are,,think about what you've thought of them,,and then actually do it,,because it's somethingnthat's really going to change our lives. 
 So, thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm Michael Shermer,ndirector of the Skeptics Society,,publisher of "Skeptic" magazine.,We investigate claims of the paranormal,,pseudo-science, fringe groups and cults,nand claims of all kinds between,,science and pseudo-sciencenand non-science and junk science,,voodoo science, pathological science,nbad science, non-science,,and plain old non-sense.,And unless you've been on Mars recently,,you know there's a lot of that out there. 
 Some people call us debunkers,nwhich is kind of a negative term.,But let's face it, there's a lot of bunk.,We are like the bunko squadsnof the police departments out there --,well, we're sort of likenthe Ralph Naders of bad ideas, 
 (Laughter) 
 trying to replace bad ideasnwith good ideas. 
 I'll show you an example of a bad idea.,I brought this with me,,this was given to usnby NBC Dateline to test.,It's produced by the QuadronCorporation of West Virginia.,It's called the Quadro 2000 Dowser Rod. 
 (Laughter) 
 This was being sold to high-schoolnadministrators for $900 apiece.,It's a piece of plastic with a RadionShack antenna attached to it.,You could dowse for all sorts of things,,but this particular one was builtnto dowse for marijuana,in students' lockers. 
 (Laughter) 
 So the way it worksnis you go down the hallway,,and you see if it tiltsntoward a particular locker,,and then you open the locker.,So it looks something like this.,I'll show you. 
 (Laughter) 
 Well, it has kind of a right-leaning bias.,Well, this is science,nso we'll do a controlled experiment.,It'll go this way for sure. 
 (Laughter) 
 Sir, do you want to emptynyour pockets, please, sir? 
 (Laughter) 
 So the question was, can it actuallynfind marijuana in students' lockers?,And the answer is,nif you open enough of them, yes. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 But in science, we have to keep tracknof the misses, not just the hits.,And that's probably the key lessonnto my short talk here:,This is how psychics work, astrologers,ntarot card readers and so on.,People remember the hitsnand forget the misses.,In science, we keep the whole database,,and look to see if the numbernof hits somehow stands out,from the total numbernyou'd expect by chance. 
 In this case, we tested it. 
 We had two opaque boxes:,one with government-approved THCnmarijuana, and one with nothing.,And it got it 50 percent of the time -- 
 (Laughter) 
 which is exactly what you'd expectnwith a coin-flip model.,So that's just a fun little examplenhere of the sorts of things we do. 
 "Skeptic" is the quarterly publication.nEach one has a particular theme.,This one is on the future of intelligence.,Are people getting smarter or dumber?,I have an opinion of this myselfnbecause of the business I'm in,,but in fact, people, it turns out,nare getting smarter.,Three IQ points per 10 years, going up.,Sort of an interesting thing. 
 With science, don't think of skepticismnas a thing, or science as a thing.,Are science and religion compatible?,It's like, are sciencenand plumbing compatible?,They're just two different things.,Science is not a thing. It's a verb.,It's a way of thinking about things.,It's a way of looking for naturalnexplanations for all phenomena. 
 I mean, what's more likely:,that extraterrestrial intelligencesnor multi-dimensional beings,travel across vast distancesnof interstellar space,to leave a crop circle in Farmer Bob'snfield in Puckerbrush, Kansas,to promote skeptic.com, our web page?,Or is it more likely that a readernof "Skeptic" did this with Photoshop?,And in all cases we have to ask -- 
 (Laughter) 
 What's the more likely explanation?,Before we say somethingnis out of this world,,we should first make surenthat it's not in this world.,What's more likely:,that Arnold had extraterrestrial helpnin his run for the governorship,,or that the "World Weekly News"nmakes stuff up? 
 (Laughter) 
 The same theme is expressed nicelynhere in this Sidney Harris cartoon.,For those of you in the back,nit says here: "Then a miracle occurs.,I think you need to be morenexplicit here in step two.",This single slide completely dismantlesnthe intelligent design arguments.,There's nothing more to it than that. 
 (Applause) 
 You can say a miracle occurs,,it's just that it doesn't explainnanything or offer anything.,There's nothing to test.,It's the end of the conversationnfor intelligent design creationists. 
 And it's true, scientists sometimes thrownterms out as linguistic place fillers --,dark energy or dark matter,nsomething like that --,until we figure out what it is,nwe'll call it this.,It's the beginning of the causalnchain for science.,For intelligent design creationists,nit's the end of the chain.,So again, we can ask this:nwhat's more likely?,Are UFOs alien spaceships, or perceptualncognitive mistakes, or even fakes? 
 This is a UFO shot from my housenin Altadena, California,,looking down over Pasadena.,And if it looks a lot like a Buicknhubcap, it's because it is.,You don't even need Photoshopnor high-tech equipment,,you don't need computers.,This was shot with a throwawaynKodak Instamatic camera.,You just have somebody off on the sidenwith a hubcap ready to go.,Camera's ready -- that's it. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, although it's possiblenthat most of these things are fake,or illusions or so on,nand that some of them are real,,it's more likely that all of themnare fake, like the crop circles. 
 On a more serious note, in all of sciencenwe're looking for a balance,between data and theory.,In the case of Galileo,nhe had two problems,when he turned his telescope to Saturn.,First of all, there was nontheory of planetary rings.,Second of all, his datanwas grainy and fuzzy,,and he couldn't quite make outnwhat he was looking at.,So he wrote that he had seen --,"I have observed that the furthestnplanet has three bodies.",And this is what he ended upnconcluding that he saw.,So without a theory of planetarynrings and with only grainy data,,you can't have a good theory.,It wasn't solved until 1655. 
 This is Christiaan Huygens's booknthat catalogs all the mistakes,people made trying to figure outnwhat was going on with Saturn.,It wasn't till Huygens had two things:,He had a good theory of planetary ringsnand how the solar system operated,,and he had better telescopic,nmore fine-grain data,in which he could figure out thatnas the Earth is going around faster --,according to Kepler's Laws --nthan Saturn, then we catch up with it.,And we see the angles of the ringsnat different angles, there.,And that, in fact, turns out to be true. 
 The problem with having a theory is thatnit may be loaded with cognitive biases.,So one of the problems of explainingnwhy people believe weird things,is that we have things, on a simple level,,and then I'll go to more serious ones.,Like, we have a tendency to see faces. 
 This is the face on Mars.,In 1976, where there was a whole movementnto get NASA to photograph that area,because people thought this was monumentalnarchitecture made by Martians.,Here's the close-up of it from 2001.,If you squint, you can still see the face.,And when you're squinting,,you're turning that from fine-grainnto coarse-grain,,so you're reducingnthe quality of your data.,And if I didn't tell you what to look for,nyou'd still see the face,,because we're programmednby evolution to see faces. 
 Faces are important for us socially.,And of course, happy faces,nfaces of all kinds are easy to see.,You see the happy face on Mars, there. 
 (Laughter) 
 If astronomers were frogs,nperhaps they'd see Kermit the Frog.,Do you see him there? Little froggy legs.,Or if geologists were elephants? 
 Religious iconography. 
 (Laughter) 
 Discovered by a Tennessee baker in 1996.,He charged five bucks a headnto come see the nun bun,till he got a cease-and-desistnfrom Mother Teresa's lawyer.,Here's Our Lady of Guadalupe and OurnLady of Watsonville, just down the street,,or is it up the street from here?,Tree bark is particularly goodnbecause it's nice and grainy, branchy,,black-and-white splotchy and you cannget the pattern-seeking --,humans are pattern-seeking animals. 
 Here's the Virgin Mary on the sidenof a glass window in Sao Paulo.,Here's when the Virgin Mary madenher appearance on a cheese sandwich --,which I got to actuallynhold in a Las Vegas casino --,of course, this being America. 
 (Laughter) 
 This casino paid $28,500non eBay for the cheese sandwich. 
 (Laughter) 
 But who does it really look like?nThe Virgin Mary? 
 (Laughter) 
 It has that sort ofnpuckered lips, 1940s-era look. 
 Virgin Mary in Clearwater, Florida.,I actually went to see this one.,There was a lot of people there.,The faithful come in their wheelchairsnand crutches, and so on.,We went down and investigated.,Just to give you a size, that's Dawkins,nme and The Amazing Randi,,next to this two,ntwo and a half story-sized image.,All these candles, thousands of candlesnpeople had lit in tribute to this.,So we walked around the backside,nto see what was going on.,It turns out wherever there'sna sprinkler head and a palm tree,,you get the effect.,Here's the Virgin Mary on the backside,nwhich they started to wipe off.,I guess you can only havenone miracle per building. 
 (Laughter) 
 So is it really a miracle of Mary,nor is it a miracle of Marge? 
 (Laughter) 
 And now I'm going to finish upnwith another example of this,,with auditory illusions.,There's this film, "White Noise,"nwith Michael Keaton,,about the dead talking back to us.,By the way, the whole business of talkingnto the dead is not that big a deal.,Anybody can do it, turns out.,It's getting the dead to talknback that's the really hard part. 
 (Laughter) 
 In this case, supposedly, these messagesnare hidden in electronic phenomena.,There's a ReverseSpeech.com web pagenwhere I downloaded this stuff.,This is the most famous onenof all of these.,Here's the forward versionnof the very famous song. 
 (Music with lyrics) 
 If there's a bustle in your hedgerowndon't be alarmed now.,It's just a spring cleannfor the May Queen.,Yes, there are two paths youncan go by, but in the long run,,There's still time to changenthe road you're on. 
 (Music ends) 
 Couldn't you just listen to that all day? 
 All right, here it is backwards,,and see if you can hear the hiddennmessages that are supposedly in there. 
 (Music with unintelligible lyrics) 
 (Lyrics) Satan! 
 (Unintelligible lyrics continue) 
 What did you get?nAudience: Satan! 
 Satan. OK, at least we got "Satan".,Now, I'll prime the auditorynpart of your brain,to tell you what you're supposednto hear, and then hear it again. 
 (Music with lyrics) 
 (Music ends) 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 You can't miss itnwhen I tell you what's there. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm going to just endnwith a positive, nice little story.,The Skeptics is a nonprofitneducational organization.,We're always looking for littlengood things that people do. 
 And in England, there's a pop singer.,One of the top popular singersnin England today, Katie Melua.,And she wrote a beautiful song.,It was in the top five in 2005, called,n"Nine Million Bicycles in Beijing.",It's a love story -- she's sortnof the Norah Jones of the UK --,about how she much loves her guy,,and compared to nine millionnbicycles, and so forth.,And she has this one passage here. 
 (Music) 
 (Lyrics) We are 12 billionnlight-years from the edge 
 That's a guess, 
 No one can ever say it's true, 
 But I know that I will always be with you. 
 Michael Shermer: Well, that's nice.nAt least she got it close.,In America it'd be,n"We're 6,000 light years from the edge." 
 (Laughter) 
 But my friend, Simon Singh, the particlenphysicist now turned science educator,,who wrote the bookn"The Big Bang," and so on,,uses every chance he getsnto promote good science.,And so he wrote an op-ed piecenin "The Guardian" about Katie's song,,in which he said, well, we know exactlynhow far from the edge.,You know, it's 13.7 billion light years,nand it's not a guess.,We know within precisenerror bars how close it is.,So we can say, although not absolutelyntrue, it's pretty close to being true. 
 And, to his credit, Katie called him upnafter this op-ed piece came out, and said,,"I'm so embarrassed.nI was in the astronomy club.,I should've known better.",And she re-cut the song.,So I will end with the new version. 
 (Music with lyrics) 
 We are 13.7 billion light years,from the edge of the observable universe.,That's a good estimatenwith well-defined error bars.,And with the available information,,I predict that I will always be with you. 
 (Laughter) 
 How cool is that? 
 (Applause)I've been at MIT for 44 years.,I went to TED I.,There's only one other person here,nI think, who did that.,All the other TEDs --,and I went to them all,nunder Ricky's regime --,I talked aboutnwhat the Media Lab was doing,,which today has almost 500 people in it. 
 And if you read the press,,last week it actually saidnI quit the Media Lab.,I didn't quit the Media Lab,nI stepped down as chairman --,which was a kind of ridiculous title,nbut someone else has taken it on --,and one of the thingsnyou can do as a professor,is you stay on as a professor.,And I will now do for the rest of my lifenthe One Laptop Per Child,,which I've sort of been doingnfor a year and a half, anyway.,So I'm going to tell you about this,,use my 18 minutesnto tell you why we're doing it,,how we're doing itnand then what we're doing.,And at some point I'll even pass around,what the $100 laptop might be like. 
 I was asked by Chrisnto talk about some of the big issues,,and so I figured I'd start with the threenthat at least drove me to do this.,And the first is pretty obvious.,It's amazing when you meetna head of state, and you say,,"What is your most preciousnnatural resource?",They will not say "children" at first,,and then when you say, "children,"nthey will pretty quickly agree with you.,And so that isn't very hard. 
 (Laughter) 
 Everybody agrees that whatevernthe solutions are to the big problems,,they include education,nsometimes can be just education,and can never be withoutnsome element of education.,So that's certainly part of it. 
 And the thirdnis a little bit less obvious.,And that is that we all in this roomnlearned how to walk, how to talk,,not by being taught how to talk,nor taught how to walk,,but by interacting with the world,,by having certain results as a consequencenof being able to ask for something,,or being able to stand up and reach it.,Whereas at about the age six,nwe were told to stop learning that way,,and that all learning from then onnwould happen through teaching,,whether it's people standing up,nlike I'm doing now,,or a book, or something.,But it was really through teaching.,And one of the things in generalnthat computers have provided to learning,is that it now includes a kind of learning,which is a little bit morenlike walking and talking,,in the sense that a lot of it is drivennby the learner himself or herself. 
 So with those as the principles --,some of you may know Seymour Papert.,This is back in 1982,nwhen we were working in Senegal.,Because some people think thatnthe $100 laptop just happened a year ago,,or two years ago,nor we were struck by lightning --,this actually has gone back a long time,nand in fact, back to the '60s.,Here we're in the '80s.,Steve Jobs had given us some laptops.nWe were in Senegal.,It didn't scale,but it at least was bringing computersnto developing countries,and learning pretty quicklynthat these kids,,even though English wasn't their language,,the Latin alphabetnbarely was their language,,but they could just swim like fish.,They could play these like pianos. 
 A little bit more recently,nI got involved personally.,And these are two anecdotes --,one was in Cambodia,,in a village that has no electricity,nno water, no television, no telephone,,but has broadband Internet now.,And these kids,ntheir first English word is "Google",and they only know Skype.,They've never heard of telephony.,They just use Skype.,And they go home at night --,they've got a broadband connectionnin a hut that doesn't have electricity.,The parents love it,nbecause when they open up the laptops,,it's the brightest light sourcenin the house.,And talk aboutnwhere metaphors and reality mix --,this is the actual school. 
 In parallel with this,nSeymour Papert got the governor of Maine,to legislate one laptop per childnin the year 2002.,Now at the time, I think it's fair to saynthat 80 percent of the teachers were --,let me say, apprehensive.,Really, they were actually against it.,And they really preferrednthat the money would be used,for higher salaries,nmore schools, whatever. 
 And now, three and a halfnyears later, guess what?,They're reporting five things:ndrop of truancy to almost zero,,attending parent-teacher meetings --,which nobody didnand now almost everybody does --,drop in discipline problems,nincrease in student participation.,Teachers are now sayingnit's kind of fun to teach.,Kids are engaged -- they have laptops! --,and then the fifth,nwhich interests me the most,,is that the servers have to be turned offnat certain times at night,because the teachersnare getting too much email,from the kids asking them for help.,So when you see that kind of thing --,this is not somethingnthat you have to test.,The days of pilot projects are over,nwhen people say,,"We'd like to do three or four thousandnin our country to see how it works.",Screw you. Go to the back of the linenand someone else will do it,,and then when you figure outnthat this works, you can join as well.,And this is what we're doing. 
 (Laughter) (Applause) 
 So, One Laptop Per Childnwas formed about a year and a half ago.,It's a nonprofit association.,It raised about 20 million dollars,to do the engineeringnto just get this built,,and then have it produced afterwards.,Scale is truly important.,And it's not important because you cannbuy components at a lower price, OK?,It's because you can gonto a manufacturer --,and I will leave the name out --,but we wanted a small display,,doesn't have to havenperfect color uniformity.,It can even have a pixel or two missing.,It doesn't have to be that bright.,And this particular manufacturer said,,"We're not interested in that.nWe're interested in the living room.,We're interestednin perfect color uniformity.,We're interested in big displays,nbright displays.,You're not part of our strategic plan.",And I said, "That's kind of too bad,nbecause we need 100 million units a year." 
 (Laughter) 
 And they said, "Oh, well, maybe we couldnbecome part of your strategic plan.",And that's why scale counts.,And that's why we will not launch this,without five to 10 million unitsnin the first run.,And the idea isnto launch with enough scale,that the scale itselfnhelps bring the price down,,and that's why I saidnseven to 10 million there.,And we're doing itnwithout a sales-and-marketing team.,I mean, you're lookingnat the sales-and-marketing team.,We will do it by goingnto seven large countries,and getting them to agree and launch it,,and then the others can follow.,We have partners.,It's not hard to guessnGoogle would be one.,The others are all playing to pending.,And this has beennin the press a great deal.,It's the so-called Green Machinenthat we introduced with Kofi Annan,in November at the World Summitnthat was held in Tunisia. 
 Now once people start looking at this,nthey say, "Ah, this is a laptop project.",Well, no, it's not a laptop project.nIt's an education project.,And the fun part --nand I'm quite focused on it --,I tell people I used to be a light bulb,nbut now I'm a laser --,I'm just going to get that thing built,nand it turns out it's not so hard.,Because laptop economicsnare the following:,I say 50 percent here --nit's more like 60,,60 percent of the cost of your laptop,is sales, marketing,ndistribution and profit.,Now we have none of those, OK?,None of those figure into our cost,,because first of all, we sell it at cost,nand the governments distribute it.,It gets distributednto the school system like a textbook.,So that piece disappears.,Then you have display and everything else.,Now the display on your laptop costs,,in rough numbers,n10 dollars a diagonal inch.,That can drop to eight;nit can drop to seven,but it's not going to drop to two,nor to one and a half,,unless we do some pretty clever things.,It's the rest -- that little brown box --nthat is pretty fascinating,,because the rest of your laptopnis devoted to itself.,It's a little bit like an obese person,having to use most of their energynto move their obesity. 
 (Laughter) 
 And we have a situation todaynwhich is incredible.,I've been using laptopsnsince their inception.,And my laptop runs slower,nless reliably and less pleasantly,than it ever has before.,And this year is worse. 
 (Applause) 
 People clap, sometimesnyou even get standing ovations,,and I say, "What the hell's wrongnwith you? Why are we all sitting there?",And somebody -- to remain nameless --ncalled our laptop a "gadget" recently.,And I said, "God, our laptop's going to gonlike a bat out of hell.,When you open it up,nit's going to go 'bing.'",It'll be on.,It'll be just like it was in 1985,,when you bought an Apple Macintosh 512.,It worked really well.,And we've been going steadily downhill. 
 Now, people ask all the time what it is.,That's what it is.,The two pieces that are probably notable:nit'll be a mesh network,,so when the kids open up their laptops,nthey all become a network,,and then just neednone or two points of backhaul.,You can serve a couple of thousand kidsnwith two megabits.,So you really can bring into a village,,and then the villagesncan connect themselves,,and you really can do it quite well. 
 The dual mode display --,the idea is to have a displaynthat both works outdoors --,isn't it fun using your cell phonenoutdoors in the sunlight?,Well, you can't see it.,And one of the reasons you can't see it,is because it's backlightingnmost of the time, most cell phones.,Now, what we're doing is, we're doing onenthat will be both frontlit and backlit.,And whether you manually switch itnor you do it in the software,is to be seen.,But when it's backlit, it's color.,And when it's frontlit,nit's black and white,at three times the resolution. 
 Is it all worked out? No.,That's why a lot of our people arenmore or less living in Taiwan right now.,And in about 30 days,nwe'll know for sure whether this works.,Probably the most important piece there,is that the kidsnreally can do the maintenance.,And this is again somethingnthat people don't believe,,but I really think it's quite true.,That's the machine we showed in Tunis.,This is more the directionnthat we're going to go.,And it's somethingnthat we didn't think was possible.,Now, I'm going to pass this around.,This isn't a design, OK?,So this is just a mechanicalnengineering sort of embodiment of it,for you to play with.,And it's clearly just a model.,The working one is at MIT.,I'm going to pass itnto this handsome gentleman.,At least you can decidenwhether it goes left or -- 
 Chris Anderson: Before you do it,nfor the people down in simulcast -- 
 Nicholas Negroponte: Sorry! I forgot.nCA: Just show it off a bit. 
 So wherever the camera is --nOK, good point. Thank you, Chris. 
 The idea was thatnit would be not only a laptop,,but that it could transformninto an electronic book.,So it's sort of an electronic book.,This is where when you go outside,nit's in black and white.,The games buttons are missing,,but it'll also be a games machine,,book machine.,Set it up this way,nand it's a television set.,Etc., etc. -- is that enoughnfor simulcast? OK, sorry.,I'll let Jim decidenwhich way to send it afterwards.,OK. Seven countries. 
 (Laughter) 
 I say "maybe" for Massachusetts,nbecause they actually have to do a bid.,By law you've got to bid,nand so on and so forth.,So I can't quite name them.,In the other cases,nthey don't have to do bids.,They can decide --,it's the federal government in each case.,It's kind of agonizing,,because a lot of people say,n"Let's do it at the state level,",because states are more nimblenthan the feds, just because of size.,And yet we count.,We're really dealingnwith the federal government.,We're really dealingnwith ministries of education.,And if you look at governmentsnaround the world,,ministries of educationntend to be the most conservative,,and also the ones that have huge payrolls.,Everybody thinksnthey know about education,,a lot of culture is built into it as well.,It's really hard.nAnd so it's certainly the hard road.,If you look at the countries,nthey're pretty geoculturally distributed. 
 Have they all agreed? No, not completely.,Probably Thailand, Brazil and Nigeria,are the three that arenthe most active and most agreed.,We're purposelynnot signing anything with anybody,until we actually have the working ones.,And since I visitneach one of those countries,within at least every three months,,I'm just going around the worldnevery three weeks.,Here's sort of the schedule,and I put at the bottom we might give somenaway free in two years at this meeting.,Everybody says it's a $100 laptop --,you can't do it.,Well, guess what, we're not.,We're coming in probably at 135,nto start, then drift down.,And that's very important,,because so many things hit the marketnat a price and then drift up.,It's kind of the loss leader,,and then as soon as it looks interesting,,it can't be afforded,nor it can't be scaled out.,So we're targeting 50 dollars in 2010. 
 The gray market's a big issue.,And one of the ways -- just one --,but one of the ways to helpnin the case of the gray market,is to make somethingnthat is so utterly unique --,It's a little bit like the factnthat automobiles --,thousands of automobilesnare stolen every day in the United States.,Not one singlenpost-office truck is stolen. 
 (Laughter) 
 And why?,Because there's no marketnfor post-office trucks.,It looks like a post-office truck.,You can spray paint it.nYou can do anything you want.,I just learned recently: in South Africa,nno white Volvos are stolen.,Period. None. Zero.,So we want to make itnvery much like a white Volvo. 
 Each government has a task force.,This perhaps is less interesting,,but we're trying to get the governmentsnto all work together,and it's not easy.,The economics of thisnis to start with the federal governments,and then later,nto subsequently go to other --,whether it's child-to-child funding,,so a child in this country buys onenfor a child in the developing world,,maybe of the same gender,nmaybe of the same age.,An uncle gives a niece or a nephew thatnas a birthday present.,I mean, there are all sorts of thingsnthat will happen,,and they'll be very, very exciting. 
 And everybody says -- I say --nit's an education project.,Are we providing the software?,The answer is:,The system certainly has software,,but no, we're not providingnthe education content.,That is really done in the countries.,But we are certainly constructionists.,And we certainly believenin learning by doing,and everything from Logo,nwhich was started in 1968,,to more modern things, like Scratch,nif you've ever even heard of it,,are very, very much part of it.,And that's the rollout. 
 Are we dreaming? Is this real?,It actually is real.,The only criticism, and peoplenreally don't want to criticize this,,because it is a humanitarian effort,na nonprofit effort,and to criticize itnis a little bit stupid, actually. 
 (Laughter) 
 But the one thingnthat people could criticize was,,"Great idea, but these guys can't do it.",And that could either mean these guys,nprofessors and so on couldn't do it,,or that it's not possible.,Well, on December 12, a companyncalled Quanta agreed to build it,,and since they make about one-thirdnof all the laptops on the planet today,,that question disappeared.,So it's not a matternof whether it's going to happen.,It is going to happen.,And if it comes outnat 138 dollars, so what?,If it comes out six months late, so what?,That's a pretty soft landing. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I love trees, and I'm very lucky,,because we live near a wonderful arboretum,,and Sundays, usually, I'd go there with my wife,and now, with my four-year-old,,and we'd climb in the trees, we'd play hide and seek.,The second school I was at had big trees too,,had a fantastic tulip tree, I think it was the biggest in the country,,and it also had a lot of wonderful bushes and vegetation,around it, around the playing fields. 
 One day I was grabbed by some of my classmates,,and taken in the bushes -- I was stripped; I was attacked;,I was abused; and this came out of the blue.,Now, the reason I say that, because, afterwards, I was thinking --,well, I went back into the school -- I felt dirty; I felt betrayed;,I felt ashamed, but mainly -- mainly, I felt powerless.,And 30 years later I was sitting in an airplane,,next to a lady called Veronica, who came from Chile,,and we were on a human rights tour,,and she was starting to tell me what it was like to be tortured,,and, from my very privileged position,,this was the only reference point that I had.,And it was an amazing learning experience,because, for me, human rights have been something in which I had,,you know, a part-time interest, but, mainly,,it was something that happened to other people over there. 
 But I got a phone call from Bono in 1985 and, as you know,,he's a great singer, but he's a magnificent hustler, and -- 
 (Laughter) -- 
 a very hard guy to say no to, and he was saying,,you know, just after I'd done the Biko song,,we're going to do a tour for Amnesty,,you have to be on it, and really that was the first time,that I'd been out and started meeting people,who'd watched their family being shot in front of them,,who'd had a partner thrown out of an airplane into an ocean,,and suddenly this world of human rights arrived in my world,,and I couldn't really walk away in quite the same way as before. 
 So I got involved with this tour, which was for Amnesty,,and then in '88 I took over Bono's job trying to learn how to hustle.,I didn't do it as well, but we managed to get Youssou N'Dour, Sting,,Tracy Chapman, and Bruce Springsteen to go 'round the world for Amnesty,,and it was an amazing experience.,And, once again, I got an extraordinary education,,and it was the first time, really,,that I'd met a lot of these people in the different countries,,and these human rights stories became very physical,,and, again, I couldn't really walk away quite so comfortably. 
 But the thing that really amazed me, that I had no idea,,was that you could suffer in this way,and then have your whole experience, your story, denied,,buried and forgotten.,And it seemed that whenever there was a camera around,,or a video or film camera,,it was a great deal harder to do -- for those in power to bury the story.,And Reebok set up a foundation after these Human Rights Now tours,and there was a decision then --,well, we made a proposal, for a couple of years,,about trying to set up a division,that was going to give cameras to human rights activists.,It didn't really get anywhere,,and then the Rodney King incident happened, and people thought,,OK, if you have a camera in the right place at the right time,,or, perhaps, the wrong time, depending who you are,,then you can actually start doing something,,and campaigning, and being heard,,and telling people about what's going on. 
 So, WITNESS was started in '92,and it's since given cameras out in over 60 countries.,And we campaign with activist groups,and help them tell their story and, in fact,,I will show you in a moment one of the most recent campaigns,,and I'm afraid it's a story from Uganda,,and, although we had a wonderful story from Uganda yesterday,,this one isn't quite so good.,In the north of Uganda,,there are something like 1.5 million internally displaced people,,people who are not refugees in another country,,but because of the civil war, which has been going on for about 20 years,,they have nowhere to live.,And 20,000 kids have been taken away to become child soldiers,,and the International Criminal Court is going after five of the leaders of the --,now, what's it called?,I forget the name of the of the army --,it's Lord's Resistance Army, I believe --,but the government, also, doesn't have a clean sheet,,so if we could run the first video. 
 (Music),Woman: Life in the camp is never simple. Even today life is difficult.,We stay because of the fear that what pushed us into the camp ...,still exists back home.,Text: "Between Two Fires: Torture and Displacement in Northern Uganda",Man: When we were at home, it was Kony's [rebel] soldiers disturbing us.,At first, we were safe in the camp.,But later the government soldiers began mistreating us a lot. 
 (Chanting),Jennifer: A soldier walked onto the road, asking where we'd been.,Evelyn and I hid behind my mother.,Evelyn: He ordered us to sit down, so we sat down.,The other soldier also came.,Jennifer: The man came and started undressing me.,The other one carried Evelyn aside.,The one who was defiling me then left me and went to rape Evelyn.,And the one who was raping Evelyn came and defiled me also.,Man: The soldiers with clubs this long beat us to get a confession.,They kept telling us, "Tell the truth!" as they beat us.,Woman: They insisted that I was lying.,At that moment, they fired and shot off my fingers.,I fell. They ran to join the others ... leaving me for dead. 
 (Music),Text: Uganda ratified the Convention Against Torture in 1986.,Torture is defined as any act by which severe pain of suffering,,whether physical or mental,,is intentionally inflicted by a person acting in an official capacity,to obtain information or a confession, to punish, coerce or intimidate. 
 Peter Gabriel: So torture is not something that always happens on other soil.,In my country, it was --,we had been looking at pictures of British soldiers beating up young Iraqis;,we've got Abu Ghraib; we've got Guantanamo Bay.,I had a driver on my way to Newark Airport,,and he told me a story that, in the middle of the night, 4 a.m.,,he'd been taken out of his home in Queens -- taken to a place in the Midwest,,that he was interrogated and tortured,and returned to the street four weeks later,,because he had the same -- he was Middle Eastern,,and he had the same name as one of the 9/11 pilots,,and that may or may not be true --,I didn't think he was a liar, though. 
 And, I think, if we look around the world,,as well as the polar ice caps melting,,human rights, which have been fought for,,for many hundreds of years in some cases,,are, also, eroding very fast,,and that is something that we need to take a look at,and, maybe, start campaigning for.,I mean, here, too, one of our partners was at Van Jones,and the Books Not Bars project -- they have managed,,with their footage in California,to change the youth correction systems employed,,and it's much -- much -- I think, more humane methods,are being looked at, how you should lock up young kids,,and that's questionable to start off.,And as the story of Mr. Morales, just down the road,,excuse me, Mr. Gabriel,,would you mind if we delayed your execution a little bit?,No, not at all, no problem, take your time.,But this, surely, whoever that man is, whatever he's done,,this is cruel and unusual punishment. 
 Anyway, WITNESS has been trying to arm the brave people,who often put their lives at risk around the world, with cameras,,and I'd like to show you just a little more of that. Thank you. 
 (Thunder) Text: You can say a story is fabricated. 
 (Music),Text: You can say a jury is corrupt.,You can say a person is lying.,You can say you don't trust newspapers.,But you can't say,what you just saw,never happened.,Help WITNESS give cameras to the world.,Shoot a video;,expose injustice;,reveal the truth;,show us what's wrong with the world;,and maybe,we can help,make it,right.,WITNESS.,All the video you have just seen was recorded by,human rights groups working with WITNESS. 
 (Applause) 
 PG: WITNESS was born of technological innovation --,in a sense the small, portable, DV cam,was really what allowed it to come into being.,And we've also been trying to get computers out to the world,,so that groups can communicate much more effectively,,campaign much more effectively,,but now we have the wonderful possibility,,which is given to us from the mobile phone with the camera in it,,because that is cheap; it's ubiquitous; and it's moving fast,all around the world -- and it's very exciting for us. 
 And so, the dream is that we could have a world,in which anyone who has anything bad happen to them of this sort,has a chance of getting their story uploaded,,being seen, being watched,,that they really know that they can be heard,,that there would be a giant website,,maybe, a little like Google Earth,,and you could fly over and find out the realities of what's going,,for the world's inhabitants. In a way,what this technology is allowing is, really,,that a lot of the problems of the world can have a human face,,that we can actually see who's dying of AIDS,or who's being beaten up, for the first time,,and we can hear their stories in a way that the blogger culture --,if we can move that into these sort of fields,,I think we can really transform the world in all sorts of ways.,There could be a new movement growing up,,rising from the ground, reaching for the light,,and growing strong, just like a tree. Thank you.A fact,came out of MIT,,couple of years ago. Ken Hale,,who's a linguist,,said that of the 6,000 languages,spoken on Earth right now,,3,000 aren't spoken by the children.,So that in one generation,,we're going to halve our cultural diversity.,He went on to say,that every two weeks,,an elder goes to the grave,carrying the last spoken word,of that culture.,So an entire philosophy,,a body of knowledge about the natural world,that had been empirically gleaned over centuries,,goes away.,And this happens every two weeks. 
 So for the last 20 years,,since my dental experience,,I have been traveling the world,and coming back,with stories about some of these people.,What I'd like to do right now,is share some of those stories with you.,This is Tamdin.,She is a 69-year-old nun.,She was thrown in prison in Tibet for two years,for putting up a little tiny placard,protesting the occupation of her country.,And when I met her, she had just,taken a walk over the Himalayas,from Lhasa, the capital of Tibet,,into Nepal, across to India --,30 days --,to meet her leader, the Dalai Lama.,The Dalai Lama lives in Dharamsala, India.,So I took this picture three days,after she arrived,,and she had this beat-up pair of tennis shoes on,,with her toes sticking out.,And she crossed in March,,and there's a lot of snow at 18,500 feet in March. 
 This is Paldin.,Paldin is a 62-year-old monk.,And he spent 33 years in prison.,His whole monastery was thrown into prison,at the time of the uprising,,when the Dalai Lama had to leave,Tibet.,And,he was beaten, starved,,tortured -- lost all his teeth while in prison.,And when I met him, he was a kind gentle old man.,And it really impressed me --,I met him two weeks after he got out of prison --,that he went through that experience, and ended up,with the demeanor that he had. 
 So I was in Dharamsala meeting these people,,and I'd spent about five weeks there,,and I was hearing these similar stories,of these refugees that had poured out of Tibet,into Dharamsala.,And it just so happened, on the fifth week,,there was a public teaching by the Dalai Lama.,And,I was watching this crowd of monks and nuns,,many of which I had just interviewed,,and heard their stories,,and I watched their faces,,and they gave us a little FM radio,,and we could listen to the translation of his teachings.,And what he said was:,treat your enemies as if they were precious jewels,,because it's your enemies,that build your tolerance and patience,on the road to your enlightenment.,That hit me so hard,,telling these people that had been through this experience. 
 So, two months later, I went into,Tibet, and I started,interviewing the people there, taking my photographs. That's what I do.,I interview and do portraits.,And this is a little girl.,I took her portrait up on top of the Jokhang Temple.,And I'd snuck in --,because it's totally illegal to have a picture of the Dalai Lama in Tibet --,it's the quickest way you can get arrested.,So I snuck in a bunch of little wallet-sized pictures of the Dalai Lama,,and I would hand them out.,And when I gave them to the people,,they'd either hold them to their heart,,or they'd hold them up to their head and just stay there.,And this is --,well, at the time -- I did this 10 years ago --,that was 36 years after the Dalai Lama had left. 
 So,I was going in, interviewing these people and doing their portraits.,This is Jigme and her sister, Sonam.,And they live up on the Chang Tang, the Tibetan Plateau,,way in the western part of the country.,This is at 17,000 feet.,And they had just come down from the high pastures,,at 18,000 feet.,Same thing: gave her a picture,,she held it up to her forehead.,And I usually hand out Polaroids,when I do these, because I'm setting up lights,,and checking my lights,,and when I showed her her Polaroid, she screamed and ran into her tent. 
 This is Tenzin Gyatso;,he was found to be the Buddha of Compassion at the age of two,,out in a peasant's house,,way out in the middle of nowhere.,At the age of four, he was installed,as the 14th Dalai Lama.,As a teenager, he faced,the invasion of his country,,and had to deal with it -- he was the leader of the country.,Eight years later, when they discovered there was a plot,to kill him,,they dressed him up like a beggar,and snuck him out of the country on horseback,,and took the same trip that Tamdin did.,And he's never been back to his country since.,And,if you think about this man,,46 years later,,still sticking,to this non-violent response,to a severe political and human rights issue.,And the young people,,young Tibetans, are starting to say, listen, this doesn't work.,You know, violence as a political tool,is all the rage right now.,And,he still is holding this line.,So this is our icon,to non-violence in our world --,one of our living icons. 
 This is another leader of his people.,This is Moi. This is in the Ecuadorian Amazon.,And Moi is 35 years old.,And,this area of the Ecuadorian Amazon --,oil was discovered in 1972.,And in this period of time -- since that time --,as much oil, or twice as much oil,as was spilled in the Exxon Valdez accident,,was spilled in this little area of the Amazon,,and the tribes in this area have constantly had to move.,And Moi,belongs to the Huaorani tribe,,and they're known as,very fierce, they're known as "auca.",And they've managed to keep out,the seismologists and the oil workers,with spears and blowguns.,And we spent --,I was with a team --,two weeks with these guys out in the jungle,watching them hunt.,This was on a monkey hunt,,hunting with curare-tipped darts.,And the knowledge that these people have,about the natural environment is incredible.,They could hear things, smell things, see things I couldn't see.,And I couldn't even see the monkeys,that they were,getting with these darts. 
 This is Yadira,,and Yadira is,five years old. She's in a,tribe that's neighboring the Huaorani.,And her tribe has had to move,three times in the last 10 years because of the oil spills.,And we never hear about that. And the latest,infraction against these people is,,as part of Plan Colombia,,we're spraying Paraquat or Round Up, whatever it is --,we're defoliating thousands of acres,of the Ecuadorian Amazon,in our war on drugs.,And these people are the people who take the brunt of it. 
 This is Mengatoue.,He's the shaman of the Huaorani,,and,he said to us, you know, I'm an older man now;,I'm getting tired, you know; I'm tired,of spearing these oil workers.,I wish they would just go away.,And I was -- I usually travel alone,when I do my work, but I did this --,I hosted a program for Discovery,,and when I went down with the team,,I was quite concerned about,going in with a whole bunch of people, especially into the Huaorani,,deep into the Huaorani tribe.,And,as it turned out, these guys really,taught me a thing or two about blending in,with the locals.,(Laughter) 
 One of the things I did,just before 9/11 --,August of 2001 --,I took my son, Dax,,who was 16 at the time,,and I took him to Pakistan.,Because at first I wanted --,you know, I've taken him on a couple of trips,,but I wanted him to see,people that live on a dollar a day or less.,I wanted him to get an experience,in the Islamic world,and I also wanted him to --,I was going there to work with a group,,do a story on a group called the Kalash,,that are a group of animists, 3,000 animists,,that live -- very small area --,surrounded by Islam -- there's 3,000,of these Kalash left; they're incredible people.,So it was a great experience for him. He stayed up all night with them,,drumming and dancing.,And he brought a soccer ball,,and we had soccer every night in this little village. 
 And then we went up,and met their shaman.,By the way, Mengatoue was the shaman,of his tribe as well.,And this is John Doolikahn,,who's the shaman of the Kalash.,And he's up in the mountains,,right on the border with Afghanistan.,In fact, on that other side is the area, Tora Bora,,the area where,Osama bin Laden's supposed to be. This is the tribal area.,And we watched,and stayed with,John Doolikahn.,And the shaman -- I did a whole series on shamanism,,which is,an interesting phenomenon.,But around the world,,they go into trance in different ways,,and in Pakistan,,the way they do it is they burn juniper leaves,and they sacrifice an animal,,pour the blood of the animal on the leaves,and then inhale the smoke.,And they're all praying,to the mountain gods,as they go into trance. 
 You know,,getting kids used to different realities,,I think, is so important. What Dan Dennett said the other day --,having a curriculum where they study different religions,,just to make a mental flexibility,,give them a mental flexibility,in different belief systems --,I think this is so necessary in our world today,as you see these clash of beliefs taking place.,And all the security issues they cause us.,So, one thing we did five years ago:,we started a program that links kids,in indigenous communities with kids in the United States.,So we first hooked up,a spot in the Navajo Nation with a classroom in Seattle.,We now have 15 sites.,We have one in Kathmandu, Nepal;,Dharamsala, India; Takaungu, Kenya --,Takaungu is one-third Christian, one-third Muslim,and one-third animist, the community is --,Ollantaytambo, Peru,,and Arctic Village, Alaska. 
 This is Daniel; he's one of our students,in Arctic Village, Alaska.,He lives in this log cabin --,no running water, no heat other than --,no windows,and high-speed Internet connection.,And this is --,I see this rolling out all over --,this is our site in Ollantaytambo, Peru, four years ago,,where they first saw their first computers;,now they have computers in their classrooms.,And the way we've done this --,we teach digital storytelling to these kids.,And we have them tell stories about issues in their community,in their community that they care about.,And this is in Peru, where the kids told the story,about a river that they cleaned up.,And the way we do it is, we do it in workshops,,and we bring people who want to learn,digital workflow and storytelling,,and have them,work with the kids.,And just this last year we've taken a group of teenagers in,,and this has worked the best.,So our dream is to bring teenagers together,,so they'll have a community service experience,as well as a cross-cultural experience,,as they teach kids in these areas,and help them build their communication infrastructure. 
 This is teaching Photoshop,in the Tibetan children's village in Dharamsala.,We have the website, where the kids all get their homepage.,This is all their movies. We've got about 60 movies,that these kids have made,,and they're quite incredible.,The one I want to show you --,after we get them to make the movies,,we have a night where we show the movies to the community.,And this is in Takaungu --,we've got a generator and a digital projector,,and we're projecting it up against a barn,,and showing one of the movies that they made.,And if you get a chance, you can go to our website, and you'll see,the incredible work these kids do. 
 The other thing:,I wanted to give indigenous people a voice.,That was one of the big motivating factors.,But the other motivating factor is,the insular nature of our country.,National Geographic just did a Roper Study,of 18 to 26 year olds,in our country,and in nine other industrialized countries.,It was a two million dollar study.,United States came in second to last,in geographic knowledge.,70 percent of the kids couldn't find,Afghanistan or Iraq on a map;,60 percent couldn't find India;,30 percent couldn't find the Pacific Ocean.,And this is a study,that was just done a couple of years ago. 
 So what I'd like to show you now,,in the couple of minutes I have left,,is a film that a student made in Guatemala.,We just had a workshop in Guatemala.,A week before we got to the workshop,,a massive landslide, caused by Hurricane Stan,,last October, came in and buried,600 people alive in their village.,And this kid lived in the village --,he wasn't there at the time --,and this is the little movie he put together about that.,And he hadn't seen a computer before,we did this movie. We taught him Photoshop and --,yeah, we can play it. 
 This is an old Mayan funeral chant,that he got from his grandfather. 
 Thank you very much.,(Applause)I'm Rich Baraniuk and what I'd likento talk a little bit about today,are some ideas that I thinknhave just tremendous resonance,with all the things that have beenntalked about the last two days.,So many different points of resonance,that it's going to be difficultnto bring them all up,,but I'll try to do my best.,Does anybody remember these? 
 (Laughter) 
 OK, so these are LP recordsnand they've been replaced, right?,They've been swept awaynover the last two decades,by these types of world-flatteningndigitization technologies, right?,And I think it was best witnessed,when Thomas was playing the musicnas we came in the room today.,What's happened in the music worldnis there's a culture,,or an ecosystem that's been created,that, if you take some words from Apple,,the catchphrase --nthat we create, rip, mix and burn.,What I mean by that is that anyonenin the world is free and allowed,to create new music and musical ideas.,Anyone in the world is allowednto rip or copy musical ideas,,use them in innovative ways.,Anyone is allowed to mix themnin different types of ways,,draw connections between musical ideas,,and people can burn them or createnfinal products and continue the circle.,And what that's donenis it's created, like I said,,a vibrant community that's very inclusive,,with people continually workingnto connect musical ideas,,innovate them and keep thingsnconstantly up to date.,Today's hit singlenis not last year's hit single. 
 But I'm not herento talk about music today.,I'm here to talk about books.,In particular, textbooksnand the kind of educational materials,that we use every day in school.,Has anyone here ever been to school? 
 (Laughter) 
 OK, does anybody realizenthere's a crisis in our schools,,around the world?,I'm not going to spendntoo much time on that,,but what I want to talk aboutnis some of the disconnects,that appear when an authornpublishes a book.,That in fact, the publishing process --,just because of the factnthat it's complicated,,it's heavy, books are expensive --,creates a sort of a wallnbetween authors of books,and the ultimate users of books,,be they teachers, studentsnor just general readers.,And this is even more truenif you happen to speak a language,other than one of the world'snmajor languages, and especially English.,I'm going to call these peoplenbelow the barrier "shutouts",because they're reallynshut out of the process,of being able to sharentheir knowledge with the world.,And so what I want to talk about todaynis trying to take these ideas,that we've seen in the musical culture,and try to bring thesentowards reinventing the way,we think about writing books,nusing them and teaching from them.,So, that's what I'd like to talk about,and, really, how we getnfrom where we are now,to where we need to go. 
 The first thing I'd like you to donis a little thought experiment.,Imagine taking all the world's books.,OK, everybody imagine booksnand imagine just tearing out the pages.,So, liberating these pages,and imagine digitizing themnand then storing them,in a vast, interconnected,nglobal repository.,Think of it as a massive iTunesnfor book-type content.,And then take that materialnand imagine making it all open,,so that people can modify it,nplay with it, improve it.,Imagine making it free,,so that anyone in the world can havenaccess to all of this knowledge,,and imagine using information technology,so that you can update this content,nimprove it, play with it,,on a timescale that's morenon the order of seconds instead of years.,Instead of editions of a bookncoming out every two years,,imagine them coming out every 25 seconds. 
 So, imagine we could do thatnand imagine we could put people into this.,So that we could truly buildnan ecosystem with not just authors,,but all the peoplenwho could be or want to be authors,in all the differentnlanguages of the world,,and I think if you could do this,nit would be called --,I'm just going to refer to itnas a knowledge ecosystem.,So, really, this is the dream,,and in a sense what you can think of it,is we're tryingnto enable anyone in the world,,I mean anyone in the world -- 
 (Laughter) 
 to be their own educational DJ,,creating educational materials,nsharing them with the world,,constantly innovating on them.,So, this is the dream. 
 In fact, this dreamnis actually being realized.,Over the last six-and-a-half years,,we've been working really hardnat Rice University,on a project called Connexions,,and so what I'd like to donfor the rest of the talk,is just tell you a little bit,about what people are doingnwith Connexions,,which you can kind ofnthink of as the counterpoint,to Nicholas Negroponte's talk yesterday,,where they're working on the hardwarenof bringing education to the world.,We're working on the open-source tools,and the content.,So, that's sort ofnto put it in perspective here. 
 So, create.,What are some of the peoplenthat are using these kind of tools?,Well, the first thing is,,there's a communitynof engineering professors,,from Cambridge to Kyoto,,who are developing engineering contentnin electrical engineering,to develop what you can think ofnas a massive, super textbook,that covers the entire areanof electrical engineering.,And not only that --,it can be customized for use in eachnof their own individual institutions.,If people like Kitty Jones, a shut-out --,a private music teacher and momnfrom Champagne, Illinois,,who wanted to share her fantasticnmusic content with the world,,on how to teach kids how to play music --,Her material is now usednover 600,000 times per month.,Tremendous use.,In fact, a lot of this use comingnfrom United States K-12 schools,,because anyone who's involvednin a school scale back,,the first thing that's cutnis the music curriculum.,And so this is just indicatingnthe tremendous thirst,for this kind of open, free content.,A lot of teachers are using this stuff. 
 What about ripping?nWhat about copying, reusing?,A team of volunteersnat the University of Texas at El Paso --,graduate students translatingnthis engineering super textbook ideas.,And within about a week,,having this be somenof our most popular material,in widespread use all over Latin America,nand in particular in Mexico,,because of the open,nextensible nature of this.,People, volunteers and even companies,that are translating materialsninto Asian languages,like Chinese, Japanese and Thai,,to spread the knowledge even further. 
 OK, what about people who are mixing?,What does "mixing" mean?,"Mixing" meansnbuilding customized courses,,means building customized books.,Companies like National Instruments,,who are embedding very powerful,ninteractive simulations,into the materials,,so that we can go way beyondnour regular kind of textbook,to an experience,that all the teaching materialsnare things you can actually interact with,and play around withnand actually learn as you do. 
 We've been workingnwith Teachers Without Borders,,who are very interestednin mixing our materials.,They're going to be usingnConnexions as their platform,to develop and deliver teaching materialsnfor teaching teachers how to teach,in 84 countries around the world.,TWB is currently in Iraq,,training 20,000 teachersnsupported by USAID.,And to them, this ideanof being able to remix,and customize to the local contextnis extraordinarily important,,because just providingnfree content to people,has actually been likenednby people in the developing world,to a kind of cultural imperialism --,that if you don't empower people,with the abilitynto re-contextualize the material,,translate it into their own languagenand take ownership of it,,it's not good. 
 OK, other organizationsnwe've been working with, UC Merced --,people know about UC Merced.,It's a new university in California,nin the Central Valley,,working very closelynwith community colleges.,They're actually developing,a lot of their sciencenand engineering curriculum,to spread widelynaround the world in our system.,And they're also trying to developnall of their software tools,completely open-source.,We've been working with AMD,nwhich has a project called 50x15,,which is trying to bringnInternet connectivity,to 50 percent of the world'snpopulation by 2015.,We're going to benproviding content to them,in a whole range of different languages.,And we've also been workingnwith a number of other organizations.,In particular, a bunch of the projectsnthat are funded by Hewlett Foundation,,who have taken a real leadership rolenin this area of open content. 
 OK, burn -- I thinknthis is, sort of, quite interesting.,"Burn" is the idea of tryingnto create the physical instantiation,of one of these courses.,And I think a lot of you received --,I think all of you received onenof these music books in your gift pack.,A little present for you.,Just to tell you quickly about it:nthis is an engineering textbook.,It's about 300 pages long, hardbound.,This costs -- anybody guess?,How much would it cost in a bookstore? 
 (Audience) 65 dollars. 
 Richard Baraniuk:nOK. This costs 22 dollars to the student.,Why does it cost 22 dollars?,Because it's published on demand,and it's developednfrom this repository of open materials.,If this book were to be publishednby a regular publisher,,it would cost at least 122 dollars. 
 So what we're seeing,is moving this burningnor publication process,from the regular,nsort of single-authored book,towards community-authored materials,that are modular, that are customizednto each individual class,and published on demandnvery inexpensively,,either pushed out through Amazon,or published directlynthrough an on-demand press, like QOOP.,And I think that this isnan extraordinarily interesting area,because there is tremendous areanunder this long tail in publishing.,We're not talkingnabout the Harry Potter end,,right at the left side.,We're talking about books,on hypergeometricnpartial differential equations.,Books that might selln100 copies a year, 1,000 copies a year.,There is tremendousnsustaining revenue under this long tail,to sustain open projects like ours,,but also to sustain this new emergencenof on-demand publishers,,like QOOP, who produced these two books.,And I think one of the thingsnthat you should take away from this talk,is that there's an impendingncut-out-the-middle-man disintermediation,,that's going to be happeningnin the publishing industry.,And it's going to reach a crescendonover the next few years,,and I think that it's for our benefit,nreally, and for the world's benefit. 
 OK, so what are the enablers?,What's really making all of this happen?,There's tons of technology,,and the only piece of technologynthat I really want to talk about is XML.,How many people know about XML?,Oh, great.,So it's the future of the web, right?,It's semantic representation of content.,And what you can reallynthink of XML in this case,is it's the packagingnthat we're putting around these pages.,Remember we took the book,ntore the pages out?,Well, what the XML is going to do,is it's going to turn those pagesninto Lego blocks.,XML are the nubs on the Lego,that allow us to combine the contentntogether in a myriad different ways,,and it provides us a frameworknto share content.,So, it lets you take this ecosystem,in its primordial statenof all this content,,all the pages you've torn out of books,,and create highly sophisticatednlearning machines:,books, courses, course packs. 
 It gives you the abilitynto personalize the learning experience,to each individual student,,so that every studentncan have a book or a course,that's customized to theirnlearning style, their context,,their language and the thingsnthat excite them.,It lets you reuse the same materialsnin multiple different ways,,and surprising new ways.,It lets you interconnect ideas,,indicating how fieldsnrelate to each other.,And I'll just give you my personal story.,We came up with thisnsix-and-a-half years ago,because I teach the stuff in the red box. 
 And my day job, as Chris said --nI'm an electrical engineering professor.,I teach signal processing,and my challengenwas to show that this math --,Wow, about half of younhave already fallen asleep,just looking at the equation. 
 (Laughter) 
 But this seemingly dry math,is actually the centernof this tremendously powerful web,that links technology --,that links really cool applicationsnlike music synthesizers,to tremendous economic opportunities,,but also governednby intellectual property.,And the thing that I realized,is there was no waynthat I, as an engineer,,could write this booknthat would get all of this across.,We needed a community to do it,and we needed new toolsnto be able to interconnect these ideas.,And I think that really,nin a sense, what we're trying to do,is make Minsky's dream come to a reality,,where you can imaginenall the books in a library,actually starting to talk to each other.,And people who are teachers out here --nwhoever taught, you know this --,it's the interconnections between ideasnthat teaching is really all about. 
 OK, back to math.,Imagine -- this is possible:,that every single equation that younclick on in one of your new e-texts,is something that you're going to be ablento explore and experiment with.,So imagine your kid'snalgebra textbook in seventh grade.,You can click on every single equation,and bring up a little toolnto be able to experiment with it,,tinker with it, understand it.,Because we reallyndon't understand until we do.,The same type of mark-up,nlike MathML, for chemistry.,Imagine chemistry textbooks,that actually understand the structurenof how molecules are formed.,Imagine Music XML,that actually lets you delveninto the semantic structure of music,,play with it, understand it.,It's no wonder that everybody'sngetting into it, right?,Even the three wise men. 
 (Laughter) 
 OK, the second big enabler,nand this is where I told a big lie.,The second big enablernis intellectual property.,Because, in fact, I got up here,and I talked about how greatnthe music culture is.,We can share and rip, mix and burn,nbut in fact, that's all illegal.,And we would be accusednof [piracy] for doing that,,because this music has been propertized.,It's now owned,nmuch of it by big industries.,So, really, the key thing herenis we can't let this happen.,We can't let thisnNapster thing happen here.,So, what we have to donis get it right from the very beginning.,And what we have to donis find an intellectual property framework,that makes sharing safenand makes it easily understandable.,And the inspiration herenis taken from open-source software.,Things like Linux and the GPL. 
 The Creative Commons licenses.,How many peoplenhave heard of creative commons?,If you have not, you must learn about it.,Creativecommons.org.,At the bottom of every piecenof material in Connexions,and in lots of other projects,,you can find their logo.,Clicking on that logontakes you to an absolute no-nonsense,,human-readable document, a deed,,that tells you exactlynwhat you can do with this content.,In fact, you're free to share it,nto do all of these things:,to copy it, to change it,neven to make commercial use of it,,as long as you attribute the author.,Because in academic publishingnand much of educational publishing,,it's really this idea of sharing knowledge,and making impact.,That's why people write,nnot necessarily making bucks.,We're not talkingnabout Harry Potter, right?,We're at the long tail end here.,Behind that is the legal code,nvery carefully constructed. 
 And Creative Commons is taking off --,over 43 million things out there,,licensed with a Creative Commons license.,Not just text,,but music, images, video.,And there's actually a tremendous uptake,of the number of peoplenthat are actually licensing music,to make it free for peoplenwho do this whole idea of re-sampling,,ripping, mixing, burning and sharing. 
 OK, I'd like to concludenwith just the last few points.,So, we've built this idea of a commons.,People are using it.,We get over 500,000 unique visitorsnper month, just to our particular site.,MIT OpenCourseWare,nwhich is another large open-content site,,gets a similar number of hits.,But how do we protect this?,How do we protect it into the future?,And the first thingnthat people are probably thinking,is quality control, right?,Because we're saying that anybodyncan contribute things to this commons.,Anybody can contribute anything.,So that could be a problem. 
 It didn't take long until peoplenstarted contributing materials,,for example, on lingerie,,which is actually a pretty good module.,The only problem is it's plagiarizednfrom a major French feminist journal,,and when you gonto the supposed course website,,it points to a lingerie-selling website.,So this is a little bit of a problem.,So we clearly need some kindnof idea of quality control,and this is really where the ideanof review and peer review comes in.,You come to TED. Why do you come to TED?,Because Chris and his team have ensured,that things arenvery, very high quality, right?,And so we need to be ablento do the same thing.,And we need to be ablento design structures,,and what we're doingnis designing social software,to enable anyone to buildntheir own peer review process,,and we call these things "lenses.",And basically what they allow,is anyone out there can developntheir own peer-review process,,so that they can focusnon the content in the repository,that they think is really important.,And you can think of TEDnas a potential lens. 
 So I'd just like to end by saying:,you can really view thisnas a call to action.,Connexions and open contentnis all about sharing knowledge.,All of you here are tremendously imbuednwith tremendous amounts of knowledge,,and what I'd like to donis invite each and every one of you,to contribute to this projectnand other projects of its type,,because I think togethernwe can truly change the landscape,of education and educational publishing. 
 So, thanks very much.So anyway, who am I?,I usually say to people, when they say, "What do you do?",I say, "I do hardware,",because it sort of conveniently encompasses everything I do.,And I recently said that to a venture capitalist casually at some,Valley event, to which he replied, "How quaint." 
 (Laughter) 
 And I sort of really was dumbstruck.,And I really should have said something smart.,And now I've had a little bit of time to think about it,,I would have said, "Well, you know,,if we look at the next 100 years,and we've seen all these problems in the last few days,,most of the big issues -- clean water, clean energy --,and they're interchangeable in some respects --,and cleaner, more functional materials --,they all look to me to be hardware problems.,This doesn't mean we should ignore software,,or information, or computation.",And that's in fact probably what I'm going to try and tell you about. 
 So, this talk is going to be about how do we make things,and what are the new ways that we're going to make things in the future.,Now, TED sends you a lot of spam if you're a speaker,about "do this, do that" and you fill out all these forms,,and you don't actually know how they're going to describe you,,and it flashed across my desk that they were going to introduce me as a futurist.,And I've always been nervous about the term "futurist,",because you seem doomed to failure because you can't really predict it.,And I was laughing about this with the very smart colleagues I have,,and said, "You know, well, if I have to talk about the future, what is it?",And George Homsey, a great guy, said, "Oh, the future is amazing.,It is so much stranger than you think.,We're going to reprogram the bacteria in your gut,,and we're going to make your poo smell like peppermint." 
 (Laughter) 
 So, you may think that's sort of really crazy,,but there are some pretty amazing things that are happening,that make this possible.,So, this isn't my work, but it's work of good friends of mine at MIT.,This is called the registry of standard biological parts.,This is headed by Drew Endy and Tom Knight,and a few other very, very bright individuals.,Basically, what they're doing is looking at biology as a programmable system.,Literally, think of proteins as subroutines,that you can string together to execute a program.,Now, this is actually becoming such an interesting idea.,This is a state diagram. That's an extremely simple computer. 
 This one is a two-bit counter.,So that's essentially the computational equivalent of two light switches.,And this is being built by a group of students at Zurich,for a design competition in biology.,And from the results of the same competition last year,,a University of Texas team of students programmed bacteria,so that they can detect light and switch on and off.,So this is interesting in the sense that you can now,do "if-then-for" statements in materials, in structure.,This is a pretty interesting trend,,because we used to live in a world where everyone's said glibly,,"Form follows function," but I think I've sort of grown up in a world,-- you listened to Neil Gershenfeld yesterday;,I was in a lab associated with his -- where it's really a world,where information defines form and function. 
 I spent six years thinking about that,,but to show you the power of art over science --,this is actually one of the cartoons I write. These are called "HowToons.",I work with a fabulous illustrator called Nick Dragotta.,Took me six years at MIT,,and about that many pages to describe what I was doing,,and it took him one page. And so this is our muse Tucker.,He's an interesting little kid -- and his sister, Celine --,and what he's doing here,is observing the self-assembly of his Cheerios in his cereal bowl.,And in fact you can program the self-assembly of things,,so he starts chocolate-dipping edges,,changing the hydrophobicity and the hydrophylicity.,In theory, if you program those sufficiently,,you should be able to do something pretty interesting,and make a very complex structure.,In this case, he's done self-replication of a complex 3D structure.,And that's what I thought about for a long time,,because this is how we currently make things.,This is a silicon wafer, and essentially,that's just a whole bunch of layers of two-dimensional stuff, sort of layered up.,The feature side is -- you know, people will say,,[unclear] down around about 65 nanometers now. 
 On the right, that's a radiolara.,That's a unicellular organism ubiquitous in the oceans.,And that has feature sizes down to about 20 nanometers,,and it's a complex 3D structure.,We could do a lot more with computers and things generally,if we knew how to build things this way.,The secret to biology is, it builds computation,into the way it makes things. So this little thing here, polymerase,,is essentially a supercomputer designed for replicating DNA.,And the ribosome here is another little computer,that helps in the translation of the proteins.,I thought about this,in the sense that it's great to build in biological materials,,but can we do similar things?,Can we get self-replicating-type behavior?,Can we get complex 3D structure automatically assembling,in inorganic systems?,Because there are some advantages to inorganic systems,,like higher speed semiconductors, etc. 
 So, this is some of my work,on how do you do an autonomously self-replicating system.,And this is sort of Babbage's revenge.,These are little mechanical computers.,These are five-state state machines.,So, that's about three light switches lined up.,In a neutral state, they won't bind at all.,Now, if I make a string of these, a bit string,,they will be able to replicate.,So we start with white, blue, blue, white.,That encodes; that will now copy. From one comes two,,and then from two comes three.,And so you've got this sort of replicating system.,It was work actually by Lionel Penrose,,father of Roger Penrose, the tiles guy.,He did a lot of this work in the '60s,,and so a lot of this logic theory lay fallow,as we went down the digital computer revolution, but it's now coming back. 
 So now I'm going to show you the hands-free, autonomous self-replication.,So we've tracked in the video the input string,,which was green, green, yellow, yellow, green.,We set them off on this air hockey table.,You know, high science uses air hockey tables -- 
 (Laughter) 
 -- and if you watch this thing long enough you get dizzy,,but what you're actually seeing is copies of that original string,emerging from the parts bin that you have here.,So we've got autonomous replication of bit strings.,So, why would you want to replicate bit strings?,Well, it turns out biology has this other very interesting meme,,that you can take a linear string, which is a convenient thing to copy,,and you can fold that into an arbitrarily complex 3D structure.,So I was trying to, you know, take the engineer's version:,Can we build a mechanical system in inorganic materials,that will do the same thing? 
 So what I'm showing you here is that we can make a 2D shape --,the B -- assemble from a string of components,that follow extremely simple rules.,And the whole point of going with the extremely simple rules here,,and the incredibly simple state machines in the previous design,,was that you don't need digital logic to do computation.,And that way you can scale things much smaller than microchips.,So you can literally use these as the tiny components in the assembly process. 
 So, Neil Gershenfeld showed you this video on Wednesday, I believe,,but I'll show you again.,This is literally the colored sequence of those tiles.,Each different color has a different magnetic polarity,,and the sequence is uniquely specifying the structure that is coming out.,Now, hopefully, those of you who know anything about graph theory,can look at that, and that will satisfy you,that that can also do arbitrary 3D structure,,and in fact, you know, I can now take a dog, carve it up,and then reassemble it so it's a linear string,that will fold from a sequence. And now,I can actually define that three-dimensional object as a sequence of bits.,So, you know, it's a pretty interesting world,when you start looking at the world a little bit differently.,And the universe is now a compiler.,And so I'm thinking about, you know, what are the programs,for programming the physical universe?,And how do we think about materials and structure,,sort of as an information and computation problem?,Not just where you attach a micro-controller to the end point,,but that the structure and the mechanisms are the logic, are the computers. 
 Having totally absorbed this philosophy,,I started looking at a lot of problems a little differently.,With the universe as a computer,,you can look at this droplet of water,as having performed the computations.,You set a couple of boundary conditions, like gravity,,the surface tension, density, etc., and then you press "execute,",and magically, the universe produces you a perfect ball lens.,So, this actually applied to the problem,of -- so there's a half a billion to a billion people in the world,don't have access to cheap eyeglasses.,So can you make a machine,that could make any prescription lens very quickly on site?,This is a machine where you literally define a boundary condition.,If it's circular, you make a spherical lens.,If it's elliptical, you can make an astigmatic lens.,You then put a membrane on that and you apply pressure --,so that's part of the extra program.,And literally with only those two inputs --,so, the shape of your boundary condition and the pressure --,you can define an infinite number of lenses,that cover the range of human refractive error,,from minus 12 to plus eight diopters, up to four diopters of cylinder.,And then literally, you now pour on a monomer.,You know, I'll do a Julia Childs here.,This is three minutes of UV light.,And you reverse the pressure on your membrane,once you've cooked it. Pop it out.,I've seen this video, but I still don't know if it's going to end right. 
 (Laughter) 
 So you reverse this. This is a very old movie,,so with the new prototypes, actually both surfaces are flexible,,but this will show you the point.,Now you've finished the lens, you literally pop it out.,That's next year's Yves Klein, you know, eyeglasses shape.,And you can see that that has a mild prescription of about minus two diopters.,And as I rotate it against this side shot, you'll see that that has cylinder,,and that was programmed in --,literally into the physics of the system.,So, this sort of thinking about structure as computation,and structure as information leads to other things, like this. 
 This is something that my people at SQUID Labs,are working on at the moment, called "electronic rope.",So literally, you think about a rope. It has very complex structure in the weave.,And under no load, it's one structure.,Under a different load, it's a different structure. And you can actually exploit that,by putting in a very small number of,conducting fibers to actually make it a sensor.,So this is now a rope that knows the load on the rope,at any particular point in the rope.,Just by thinking about the physics of the world,,materials as the computer,,you can start to do things like this. 
 I'm going to segue a little here.,I guess I'm just going to casually tell you the types of things,that I think about with this.,One thing I'm really interested about this right now is, how,,if you're really taking this view of the universe as a computer,,how do we make things in a very general sense,,and how might we share the way we make things in a general sense,the same way you share open source hardware?,And a lot of talks here have espoused the benefits,of having lots of people look at problems,,share the information and work on those things together.,So, a convenient thing about being a human is you move in linear time,,and unless Lisa Randall changes that,,we'll continue to move in linear time.,So that means anything you do, or anything you make,,you produce a sequence of steps --,and I think Lego in the '70s nailed this,,and they did it most elegantly.,But they can show you how to build things in sequence.,So, I'm thinking about, how can we generalize,the way we make all sorts of things,,so you end up with this sort of guy, right?,And I think this applies across a very broad -- sort of, a lot of concepts. 
 You know, Cameron Sinclair yesterday said,,"How do I get everyone to collaborate on design,globally to do housing for humanity?",And if you've seen Amy Smith,,she talks about how you get students at MIT,to work with communities in Haiti.,And I think we have to sort of redefine and rethink,how we define structure and materials and assembly things,,so that we can really share the information,on how you do those things in a more profound way,and build on each other's source code for structure.,I don't know exactly how to do this yet,,but, you know, it's something being actively thought about. 
 So, you know, that leads to questions,like, is this a compiler? Is this a sub-routine?,Interesting things like that.,Maybe I'm getting a little too abstract, but you know,,this is the sort of -- returning to our comic characters --,this is sort of the universe, or a different universe view,,that I think is going to be very prevalent in the future --,from biotech to materials assembly. It was great to hear Bill Joy.,They're starting to invest in materials science,,but these are the new things in materials science.,How do we put real information and real structure into new ideas,,and see the world in a different way? And it's not going to be binary code,that defines the computers of the universe --,it's sort of an analog computer.,But it's definitely an interesting new worldview. 
 I've gone too far. So that sounds like it's it.,I've probably got a couple of minutes of questions,,or I can show -- I think they also said that I do extreme stuff,in the introduction, so I may have to explain that.,So maybe I'll do that with this short video. 
 So this is actually a 3,000-square-foot kite,,which also happens to be a minimal energy surface.,So returning to the droplet, again,,thinking about the universe in a new way.,This is a kite designed by a guy called Dave Kulp.,And why do you want a 3,000-square-foot kite?,So that's a kite the size of your house.,And so you want that to tow boats very fast.,So I've been working on this a little, also,,with a couple of other guys.,But, you know, this is another way to look at the --,if you abstract again,,this is a structure that is defined by the physics of the universe.,You could just hang it as a bed sheet,,but again, the computation of all the physics,gives you the aerodynamic shape.,And so you can actually sort of almost double your boat speed,with systems like that. So that's sort of another interesting aspect of the future.

 Hi, everyone. I'm Sirena.,I'm 11 years old and from Connecticut.,(Audience cheers) 
 (Applause) 
 Well, I'm not really sure why I'm here. 
 (Laughter) 
 I mean, what does this have to donwith technology, entertainment and design?,Well, I count my iPod,ncellphone and computer as technology,,but this has nothing to do with that. 
 So I did a little research on it.,Well, this is what I found.,Of course, I hope I can memorize it. 
 (Clears throat) 
 The violin is made of a wood boxnand four metal strings.,By pulling a string, it vibratesnand produces a sound wave,,which passes throughna piece of wood called a bridge,,and goes down to the wood boxnand gets amplified, but ... let me think. 
 (Laughter) 
 Placing your fingernat different places on the fingerboard,changes the string length, and thatnchanges the frequency of the sound wave.,(Sighs) Oh, my gosh! 
 (Laughter) 
 OK, this is sort of technology,,but I can call itna 16th-century technology.,But actually, the mostnfascinating thing that I found,was that even the audio systemnor wave transmission nowadays,are still based on the same principlenof producing and projecting sound.,Isn't that cool? 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Design -- I love its design.,I remember when I was little,nmy mom asked me,,"Would you like to playnthe violin or the piano?",I looked at that giant monsternand said to myself --,"I am not going to lock myselfnon that bench the whole day!" 
 (Laughter) 
 This is small and lightweight.,I can play from standing,nsitting or walking.,And, you know what?,The best of all is thatnif I don't want to practice,,(Whispering) I can hide it. 
 (Laughter) 
 The violin is very beautiful.,Some people relate itnas the shape of a lady.,But whether you like it or not,nit's been so for more than 400 years,,unlike modern stuffn[that] easily looks dated.,But I think it's very personalnand unique that,,although each violin looks pretty similar,,no two violins sound the same --,even from the same makernor based on the same model. 
 Entertainment -- I love the entertainment.,But actually, the instrument itselfnisn't very entertaining.,I mean, when I first got my violinnand tried to play around on it,,it was actually really bad,,because it didn't sound the waynI'd heard from other kids --,it was so horrible and so scratchy.,So, it wasn't entertaining at all.,But besides, my brothernfound this very funny:,Yuk! Yuk! Yuk! 
 (Laughter) 
 A few years later, I heard a joke,about the greatest violinist,nJascha Heifetz.,After Mr. Heifetz's concert,,a lady came over and complimented him:,"Oh, Mr. Heifetz, your violinnsounded so great tonight!",And Mr. Heifetz was a very cool person,,so he picked up his violin and said,,"Funny -- I don't hear anything." 
 (Laughter) 
 Now I realize that as the musician,,we human beings, with our great mind,nartistic heart and skill,,can change this 16th-century technologynand a legendary design,to a wonderful entertainment.,Now I know why I'm here. 
 (Music) 
 (Music ends) 
 (Applause) 
 At first, I thought I was justngoing to be here to perform,,but unexpectedly, I learnednand enjoyed much more.,But ... although some of the talksnwere quite up there for me. 
 (Laughter) 
 Like the multi-dimension stuff.,I mean, honestly, I'd be happy enough,if I could actually getnmy two dimensions correct in school. 
 (Laughter) 
 But actually, the mostnimpressive thing to me is that --,well, actually, I would also likento say this for all children,is to say thank you to all adults,nfor actually caring for us a lot,,and to make our future world much better.,Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 (Music) 
 (Music ends) 
 (Applause) 
 (Applause ends) 
 (Music) 
 (Music ends) 
 (Applause)In terms of invention,,I'd like to tell you the talenof one of my favorite projects.,I think it's one of the most excitingnthat I'm working on,,but I think it's also the simplest. 
 It's a project that has the potentialnto make a huge impact around the world.,It addresses one of the biggestnhealth issues on the planet,,the number one cause of deathnin children under five.,Which is ...?,Water-borne diseases?nDiarrhea? Malnutrition?,No.,It's breathing the smokenfrom indoor cooking fires --,acute respiratory infectionsncaused by this.,Can you believe that? 
 I find this shockingnand somewhat appalling.,Can't we makencleaner burning cooking fuels?,Can't we make better stoves?,How is it that this can leadnto over two million deaths every year?,I know Bill Joy was talking to younabout the wonders of carbon nanotubes,,so I'm going to talk to younabout the wonders of carbon macro-tubes,,which is charcoal. 
 (Laughter) 
 So this is a picture of rural Haiti.,Haiti is now 98 percent deforested.,You'll see scenes like thisnall over the island.,It leads to all sortsnof environmental problems,and problems that affect peoplenthroughout the nation.,A couple years agonthere was severe flooding,that led to thousands of deaths --,that's directly attributable to the fact,that there are no trees on the hillsnto stabilize the soil.,So the rains come --,they go down the riversnand the flooding happens. 
 Now one of the reasonsnwhy there are so few trees is this:,people need to cook,,and they harvest woodnand they make charcoal in order to do it.,It's not that people are ignorantnto the environmental damage.,They know perfectly well,nbut they have no other choice.,Fossil fuels are not available,,and solar energy doesn't cook the waynthat they like their food prepared.,And so this is what they do.,You'll find families like this who go outninto the forest to find a tree,,cut it down and make charcoal out of it.,So not surprisingly,,there's a lot of effort that's been donento look at alternative cooking fuels. 
 About four years ago, I tookna team of students down to Haiti,and we worked withnPeace Corps volunteers there.,This is one such volunteer,and this is a device that he had builtnin the village where he worked.,And the idea wasnthat you could take waste paper;,you could compress it,and make briquettesnthat could be used for fuel.,But this device was very slow.,So our engineering studentsnwent to work on it,and with some very simple changes,,they were able to triplenthe throughput of this device.,So you could imaginenthey were very excited about it.,And they took the briquettes back to MITnso that they could test them.,And one of the thingsnthat they found was they didn't burn.,So it was a littlendiscouraging to the students. 
 (Laughter) 
 And in fact, if you look closely,,right here you can seenit says, "US Peace Corps.",As it turns out, there actually wasn'tnany waste paper in this village.,And while it was a good usenof government paperwork,for this volunteer to bring itnback with him to his village,,it was 800 kilometers away.,And so we thought perhapsnthere might be a better way,to come up withnan alternative cooking fuel. 
 What we wanted to donis we wanted to make a fuel,that used something that wasnreadily available on the local level.,You see these all over Haiti as well.,They're small-scale sugar mills.,And the waste product from them,after you extract the juicenfrom the sugarcane,is called "bagasse.",It has no other use.,It has no nutritional value,nso they don't feed it to the animals.,It just sits in a pile near the sugar millnuntil eventually they burn it.,What we wanted to do wasnwe wanted to find a way,to harness this waste resourcenand turn it into a fuel,that would be somethingnthat people could easily cook with,,something like charcoal.,So over the next couple of years,,students and I workednto develop a process. 
 So you start with the bagasse,nand then you take a very simple kiln,that you can make out ofna waste fifty five-gallon oil drum.,After some time, after setting it on fire,,you seal it to restrict the oxygennthat goes into the kiln,,and then you end upnwith this carbonized material here.,However, you can't burn this.,It's too fine and it burns too quicklynto be useful for cooking.,So we had to try to find a waynto form it into useful briquettes.,And conveniently,none of my students was from Ghana,,and he remembered a dish his momnused to make for him called "kokonte,",which is a very sticky porridgenmade out of the cassava root.,And so what we did was we looked,,and we found that cassavanis indeed grown in Haiti,,under the name of "manioc.",In fact, it's grown all over the world --,yucca, tapioca, manioc, cassava,nit's all the same thing --,a very starchy root vegetable.,And you can make a very thick,nsticky porridge out of it,,which you can use to bind togethernthe charcoal briquettes.,So we did this. We went down to Haiti.,These are the graduatesnof the first Ecole de Charbon,,or Charcoal Institute.,And these -- 
 (Laughter) 
 That's right. So I'm actuallynan instructor at MIT as well as CIT.,And these are the briquettes that we made. 
 Now I'm going to take younto a different continent.,This is India,and this is the most commonly usedncooking fuel in India.,It's cow dung.,And more than in Haiti,nthis produces really smoky fires,,and this is where you seenthe health impacts,of cooking with cow dungnand biomass as a fuel.,Kids and womennare especially affected by it,,because they're the onesnwho are around the cooking fires. 
 So we wanted to see,if we could introducenthis charcoal-making technology there.,Well, unfortunately,nthey didn't have sugarcane,and they didn't have cassava,,but that didn't stop us.,What we did was we found what werenthe locally available sources of biomass.,And there was wheat strawnand there was rice straw in this area.,And what we could use as a bindernwas actually small amounts of cow manure,,which they used ordinarily for their fuel.,And we did side-by-side tests,,and here you can seenthe charcoal briquettes,and here the cow dung.,And you can see that it's a lot cleanernburning of a cooking fuel.,And in fact, it heats the waterna lot more quickly.,And so we were very happy, thus far.,But one of the things that we found,was when we did side-by-sidencomparisons with wood charcoal,,it didn't burn as long.,And the briquettes crumbled a little bit,and we lost energy as they fell apartnas they were cooking.,So we wanted to try to find a waynto make a stronger briquette,so that we could compete withnwood charcoal in the markets in Haiti. 
 So we went back to MIT,,we took out the Instron machine,and we figured outnwhat sort of forces you needed,in order to compressna briquette to the level,that you actually are gettingnimproved performance out of it?,And at the same time that we hadnstudents in the lab looking at this,,we also had community partners in Haitinworking to develop the process,,to improve it and make it more accessiblento people in the villages there.,And after some time,,we developed a low-cost pressnthat allows you to produce charcoal,,which actually now burns not only --,actually, it burns longer,ncleaner than wood charcoal. 
 So now we're in a situationnwhere we have a product,,which is actually better than whatnyou can buy in Haiti in the marketplace,,which is a very wonderful place to be.,In Haiti alone, about 30 million treesnare cut down every year.,There's a possibilitynof this being implemented,and saving a good portion of those.,In addition, the revenue generatednfrom that charcoal is 260 million dollars.,That's an awful lotnfor a country like Haiti --,with a population of eight million,and an average incomenof less than 400 dollars.,So this is where we're also moving aheadnwith our charcoal project. 
 And one of the thingsnthat I think is also interesting,,is I have a friend up at UC Berkeleynwho's been doing risk analysis.,And he's looked at the problemnof the health impacts,of burning wood versus charcoal.,And he's found that worldwide,nyou could prevent a million deaths,switching from woodnto charcoal as a cooking fuel.,That's remarkable,,but up until now, there weren't waysnto do it without cutting down trees.,But now we have a way,that's using an agriculturalnwaste material to create a cooking fuel. 
 One of the really exciting things, though,,is something that came out of the tripnthat I took to Ghana just last month.,And I think it's the coolest thing,,and it's even lower technthan what you just saw,,if you can imagine such a thing.,Here it is.,So what is this?,This is corncobs turned into charcoal.,And the beauty of this isnthat you don't need to form briquettes --,it comes ready made.,This is my $100 laptop, right here.,And actually, like Nick,nI brought samples. 
 (Laughter) 
 So we can pass these around.,They're fully functional,nfield-tested, ready to roll out. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I think one of the things,which is also remarkablenabout this technology,,is that the technologyntransfer is so easy.,Compared to the sugarcane charcoal,,where we have to teach peoplenhow to form it into briquettes,and you have the extra stepnof cooking the binder,,this comes pre-briquetted.,And this is about the most excitingnthing in my life right now,,which is perhapsna sad commentary on my life. 
 (Laughter) 
 But once you see it,nlike you guys in the front row --,All right, yeah, OK.,So anyway -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Here it is.,And this is, I think, a perfect example,of what Robert Wright was talking aboutnin those non-zero-sum things.,So not only do you have health benefits,,you have environmental benefits.,But this is onenof the incredibly rare situations,where you also have economic benefits.,People can make their own cooking fuelnfrom waste products.,They can generate income from this.,They can save the moneynthat they were going to spend on charcoal,and they can produce excessnand sell it in the market,to people who aren't making their own.,It's really rarenthat you don't have trade-offs,between health and economics,nor environment and economics.,So this is a projectnthat I just find extremely exciting,and I'm really looking forwardnto see where it takes us. 
 So when we talk about, now,nthe future we will create,,one of the thingsnthat I think is necessary,is to have a very clear visionnof the world that we live in.,And now, I don't actually meannthe world that we live in.,I mean the world where womennspend two to three hours everyday,grinding grain for their families to eat.,I mean the worldnwhere advanced building materials,means cement roofing tilesnthat are made by hand,,and where, when you work 10 hours a day,,you're still only earningn60 dollars in a month.,I mean the world,where women and children spendn40 billion hours a year fetching water.,That's as if the entire workforcenof the state of California,worked full time for a yearndoing nothing but fetching water. 
 It's a place where,nfor example, if this were India,,in this room, only three of usnwould have a car.,If this were Afghanistan,,only one person in this roomnwould know how the use the Internet.,If this were Zambia --,300 of you would be farmers,,100 of you would have AIDS or HIV.,And more than half of you would be livingnon less than a dollar a day.,These are the issues that wenneed to come up with solutions for.,These are the issues thatnwe need to be training our engineers,,our designers, our business people,nour entrepreneurs to be facing.,These are the solutionsnthat we need to find. 
 I have a few areas that I believenare especially important that we address.,One of them is creating technologies,to promote micro-financenand micro-enterprise,,so that people who are livingnbelow the poverty line,can find a way to move out --,and that they're not doing it,using the same traditionalnbasket making, poultry rearing, etc.,But there are new technologiesnand new products,that they can make on a small scale. 
 The next thing I believe,is that we need to createntechnologies for poor farmers,to add value to their own crops.,And we need to rethinknour development strategies,,so that we're not promotingneducational campaigns,to get them to stop being farmers,,but rather to stop being poor farmers.,And we need to thinknabout how we can do that effectively.,We need to work with the peoplenin these communities,and give them the resourcesnand the tools that they need,to solve their own problems.,That's the best way to do it.,We shouldn't be doing it from outside.,So we need to create this future,nand we need to start doing it now. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: Thank you, incredible.,Stay here.,Tell us -- just while we seenif someone has a question --,just tell us about one of the other thingsnthat you've worked on. 
 Amy Smith: Some of the othernthings we're working on,are ways to do low-costnwater quality testing,,so that communities can maintainntheir own water systems,,know when they're working,nknow when they treat them, etc.,We're also looking at low-costnwater-treatment systems.,One of the really exciting thingsnis looking at solar water disinfection,and improving the abilitynto be able to do that. 
 CA: What's the bottlenecknpreventing this stuff getting from scale?,Do you need to find entrepreneurs,nor venture capitalists,,or what do you need to takenwhat you've got and get it to scale? 
 AS: I think it's large numbersnof people moving it forward.,It's a difficult thing --,it's a marketplacenwhich is very fragmented,and a consumer population with no income.,So you can't use the same modelsnthat you use in the United States,for making things move forward.,And we're a pretty small staff,,which is me. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, you know,nI do what I can with the students.,We have 30 students a yearngo out into the field,and try to implement thisnand move it forward.,The other thing is you have to do thingsnwith a long time frame,,as, you know, you can't expect to getnsomething done in a year or two years;,you have to be lookingnfive or 10 years ahead.,But I think with the vision to do that,nwe can move forward.I want to start off by saying, Houston, we have a problem.,We're entering a second generation of no progress,in terms of human flight in space. In fact, we've regressed.,We stand a very big chance of losing our ability to inspire our youth,to go out and continue this very important thing,that we as a species have always done.,And that is, instinctively we've gone out,and climbed over difficult places, went to more hostile places,,and found out later, maybe to our surprise, that that's the reason we survived.,And I feel very strongly,that it's not good enough for us to have generations of kids,that think that it's OK to look forward to a better version,of a cell phone with a video in it.,They need to look forward to exploration; they need to look forward to colonization;,they need to look forward to breakthroughs.,We need to inspire them, because they need to lead us,and help us survive in the future. 
 I'm particularly troubled that what NASA's doing right now with this new Bush doctrine,to -- for this next decade and a half -- oh shoot, I screwed up.,We have real specific instructions here not to talk about politics. 
 (Laughter) 
 What we're looking forward to is -- 
 (Applause) 
 what we're looking forward to,is not only the inspiration of our children,,but the current plan right now is not really even allowing,the most creative people in this country -- the Boeing's and Lockheed's,space engineers -- to go out and take risks and try new stuff.,We're going to go back to the moon ... 50 years later?,And we're going to do it very specifically planned to not learn anything new.,I'm really troubled by that. But anyway that's --,the basis of the thing that I want to share with you today, though,,is that right back to where we inspire people,who will be our great leaders later.,That's the theme of my next 15 minutes here.,And I think that the inspiration begins when you're very young:,three-year-olds, up to 12-, 14-year-olds.,What they look at is the most important thing. 
 Let's take a snapshot at aviation.,And there was a wonderful little short four-year time period,when marvelous things happened.,It started in 1908, when the Wright brothers flew in Paris, and everybody said,,"Ooh, hey, I can do that." There's only a few people that have flown,in early 1908. In four years, 39 countries had hundreds of airplanes,,thousand of pilots. Airplanes were invented by natural selection.,Now you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today,,but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes.,There were probably at least 30,000 different things tried,,and when they crash and kill the pilot, don't try that again.,The ones that flew and landed OK,because there were no trained pilots,who had good flying qualities by definition.,So we, by making a whole bunch of attempts, thousands of attempts,,in that four-year time period, we invented the concepts,of the airplanes that we fly today. And that's why they're so safe,,as we gave it a lot of chance to find what's good.,That has not happened at all in space flying.,There's only been two concepts tried -- two by the U.S. and one by the Russians. 
 Well, who was inspired during that time period?,Aviation Week asked me to make a list of who I thought,were the movers and shakers of the first 100 years of aviation.,And I wrote them down and I found out later that every one of them,was a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation.,Well, what happened when I was a little kid was -- some pretty heavy stuff too.,The jet age started: the missile age started. Von Braun was on there,showing how to go to Mars -- and this was before Sputnik.,And this was at a time when Mars was a hell of a lot more interesting,than it is now. We thought there'd be animals there;,we knew there were plants there; the colors change, right?,But, you know, NASA screwed that up because they've sent these robots,and they've landed it only in the deserts. 
 (Laughter) 
 If you look at what happened -- this little black line is as fast as man ever flew,,and the red line is top-of-the-line military fighters,and the blue line is commercial air transport.,You notice here's a big jump when I was a little kid --,and I think that had something to do with giving me the courage,to go out and try something that other people weren't having the courage to try.,Well, what did I do when I was a kid?,I didn't do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing,and, well, we didn't have drugs in those days. But I did competition model airplanes.,I spent about seven years during the Vietnam War,flight-testing airplanes for the Air Force.,And then I went in and I had a lot of fun building airplanes,that people could build in their garages.,And some 3,000 of those are flying. Of course, one of them,is around the world Voyager. I founded another company in '82,,which is my company now.,And we have developed more than one new type of airplane every year since 1982.,And there's a lot of them that I actually can't show you on this chart. 
 The most impressive airplane ever, I believe, was designed,only a dozen years after the first operational jet.,Stayed in service till it was too rusty to fly, taken out of service.,We retreated in '98 back to something that was developed in '56. What?,The most impressive spaceship ever, I believe,,was a Grumman Lunar Lander. It was a -- you know, it landed on the moon,,take off of the moon, didn't need any maintenance guys --,that's kind of cool.,We've lost that capability. We abandoned it in '72.,This thing was designed three years after Gagarin first flew in space in 1961.,Three years, and we can't do that now. Crazy. 
 Talk very briefly about innovation cycles, things that grow,,have a lot of activity; they die out when they're replaced by something else.,These things tend to happen every 25 years.,40 years long, with an overlap. You can put that statement,on all kinds of different technologies. The interesting thing --,by the way, the speed here, excuse me, higher-speed travel,is the title of these innovation cycles. There is none here.,These two new airplanes are the same speed as the DC8 that was done in 1958.,Here's the biggie, and that is, you don't have innovation cycles,if the government develops and the government uses it.,You know, a good example, of course, is the DARPA net.,Computers were used for artillery first, then IRS.,But when we got it, now you have all the level of activity,,all the benefit from it. Private sector has to do it.,Keep that in mind. I put down innovation --,I've looked for innovation cycles in space; I found none. 
 The very first year, starting when Gagarin went in space,,and a few weeks later Alan Shepherd, there were five manned,space flights in the world -- the very first year.,In 2003, everyone that the United States sent to space was killed.,There were only three or four flights in 2003.,In 2004, there were only two flights: two Russian Soyuz flights,to the international manned station. And I had to fly three in Mojave,with my little group of a couple dozen people,in order to get to a total of five,,which was the number the same year back in 1961.,There is no growth. There's no activity. There's no nothing. 
 This is a picture here taken from SpaceShipOne.,This is a picture here taken from orbit.,Our goal is to make it so that you can see this picture and really enjoy that.,We know how to do it for sub-orbital flying now, do it safe enough --,at least as safe as the early airlines -- so that can be done.,And I think I want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage,to go out and try that as a small company. 
 Well, first of all, what's going to happen next?,The first industry will be a high volume, a lot of players.,There's another one announced just last week.,And it will be sub-orbital. And the reason it has to be sub-orbital,is, there is not solutions for adequate safety,to fly the public to orbit. The governments have been doing this --,three governments have been doing this for 45 years,,and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died.,That's -- You don't want to run a business with that kind of a safety record.,It'll be very high volume; we think 100,000 people will fly by 2020.,I can't tell you when this will start,,because I don't want my competition to know my schedule.,But I think once it does, we will find solutions,,and very quickly, you'll see those resort hotels in orbit.,And that real easy thing to do, which is a swing around the moon,so you have this cool view. And that will be really cool.,Because the moon doesn't have an atmosphere --,you can do an elliptical orbit and miss it by 10 feet if you want.,Oh, it's going to be so much fun. 
 (Laughter) 
 OK. My critics say, "Hey, Rutan's just spending,a lot of these billionaires' money for joyrides for billionaires.,What's this? This is not a transportation system; it's just for fun.",And I used to be bothered by that, and then I got to thinking,,well, wait a minute. I bought my first Apple computer in 1978,and I bought it because I could say, "I got a computer at my house and you don't.,'What do you use it for?' Come over. It does Frogger." OK. 
 (Laughter) 
 Not the bank's computer or Lockheed's computer,,but the home computer was for games.,For a whole decade it was for fun -- we didn't even know what it was for.,But what happened, the fact that we had this big industry,,big development, big improvement and capability and so on,,and they get out there in enough homes -- we were ripe for a new invention.,And the inventor is in this audience.,Al Gore invented the Internet and because of that,,something that we used for a whole year -- excuse me --,a whole decade for fun, became everything -- our commerce, our research,,our communication and, if we let the Google guys,think for another couple weekends, we can add a dozen more things to the list. (Laughter),And it won't be very long before you won't be able to convince kids,that we didn't always have computers in our homes.,So fun is defendable. 
 OK, I want to show you kind of a busy chart,,but in it is my prediction with what's going to happen.,And in it also brings up another point, right here.,There's a group of people that have come forward --,and you don't know all of them -- but the ones that have come forward,were inspired as young children, this little three- to 15-year-old age,,by us going to orbit and going to the moon here,,right in this time period.,Paul Allen, Elan Musk, Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos, the Ansari family,,which is now funding the Russians' sub-orbital thing,,Bob Bigelow, a private space station, and Carmack.,These people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area,,and I think it's a lot better than they put it in an area,of a better cell phone or something -- but they're putting it in very --,areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability,,and it will lead us into the next really big thing,and it will allow us to explore. And I think eventually,it will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct. 
 They were inspired by big progress. But look at the progress that's going on after that.,There were a couple of examples here.,The military fighters had a -- highest-performance military airplane,was the SR71. It went a whole life cycle, got too rusty to fly,,and was taken out of service. The Concorde doubled the speed for airline travel.,It went a whole life cycle without competition,,took out of service. And we're stuck back here,with the same kind of capability for military fighters,and commercial airline travel that we had back in the late '50s. 
 But something is out there to inspire our kids now.,And I'm talking about if you've got a baby now,,or if you've got a 10-year-old now.,What's out there is there's something really interesting going to happen here.,Relatively soon, you'll be able to buy a ticket,and fly higher and faster than the highest-performance,military operational airplane. It's never happened before.,The fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance,has been, well, you know, you win the war in 12 minutes;,why do you need something better?,But I think when you guys start buying tickets and flying,sub-orbital flights to space, very soon -- wait a minute,,what's happening here, we'll have military fighters,with sub-orbital capability, and I think very soon this.,But the interesting thing about it is the commercial guys are going to go first.,OK, I look forward to a new "capitalist's space race," let's call it. 
 You remember the space race in the '60s was for national prestige,,because we lost the first two milestones.,We didn't lose them technically. The fact that we had the hardware,to put something in orbit when we let Von Braun fly it --,you can argue that's not a technical loss.,Sputnik wasn't a technical loss, but it was a prestige loss.,America -- the world saw America as not being the leader in technology,,and that was a very strong thing.,And then we flew Alan Shepherd weeks after Gagarin,,not months or decades, or whatever. So we had the capability.,But America lost. We lost. And because of that, we made a big jump to recover it. 
 Well, again, what's interesting here is we've lost,to the Russians on the first couple of milestones already.,You cannot buy a ticket commercially to fly into space in America --,can't do it. You can buy it in Russia.,You can fly with Russian hardware. This is available,because a Russian space program is starving,,and it's nice for them to get 20 million here and there to take one of the seats.,It's commercial. It can be defined as space tourism. They are also offering a trip,to go on this whip around the moon, like Apollo 8 was done.,100 million bucks -- hey, I can go to the moon.,But, you know, would you have thought back in the '60s,,when the space race was going on,,that the first commercial capitalist-like thing to do,to buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in Russian hardware?,And would you have thought, would the Russians have thought,,that when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware,,the guys inside won't be Russians? Maybe it'll probably be a Japanese,or an American billionaire? Well, that's weird: you know, it really is.,But anyway, I think we need to beat them again. 
 I think what we'll do is we'll see a successful, very successful,,private space flight industry. Whether we're first or not really doesn't matter.,The Russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the Concorde.,And then they flew a few cargo flights, and took it out of service.,I think you kind of see the same kind of parallel,when the commercial stuff is offered. 
 OK, we'll talk just a little bit about commercial development for human space flight.,This little thing says here: five times,what NASA's doing by 2020. I want to tell you, already,there's about 1.5 billion to 1.7 billion,investment in private space flight that is not government at all --,already, worldwide. If you read -- if you Google it,,you'll find about half of that money, but there's twice of that,being committed out there -- not spent yet, but being committed,and planned for the next few years. Hey, that's pretty big.,I'm predicting, though, as profitable as this industry is going to be --,and it certainly is profitable when you fly people at 200,000 dollars,on something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost,,or less -- this is going to be very profitable.,I predict, also, that the investment that will flow into this,will be somewhere around half of what the U.S. taxpayer,spends for NASA's manned spacecraft work.,And every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently,by a factor of 10 to 15. And what that means is before we know it,,the progress in human space flight, with no taxpayer dollars,,will be at a level of about five times as much,as the current NASA budgets for human space flight.,And that is because it's us. It's private industry.,You should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff --,and we've done it for a long time. The NACA, before NASA,,never developed an airliner and never ran an airline.,But NASA is developing the space liner, always has,,and runs the only space line, OK. And we've shied away from it,because we're afraid of it. But starting back in June of 2004,,when I showed that a little group out there actually can do it,,can get a start with it, everything changed after that time. 
 OK, thank you very much.

 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 Good evening and welcome to:,"Spot the TED Presenter Who Usednto Be a Broadway Accompanist." 
 (Laughter) 
 When I was offered the Timesncolumn six years ago,,the deal was like this:,you'll be sent the coolest, hottest,nslickest new gadgets.,Every week, it'll arrive at your door.,You get to try them out,nplay with them, evaluate them,until the novelty wears out,nbefore you have to send them back,,and you'll get paid for it.,You can think about it, if you want.,So, I've always been a technology nut,nand I absolutely love it.,The job, though, came with onensmall downside, and that is,,they intended to publish my email addressnat the end of every column.,And what I've noticed is -- first of all,nyou get an incredible amount of email. 
 If you ever are feeling lonely,,get a New York Times column,,because you will get hundredsnand hundreds and hundreds of emails.,And the email I'm getting a lotntoday is about frustration.,People are feeling like things --,Ok, I just had an alarmncome up on my screen.,Lucky you can't see it.,People are feeling overwhelmed.,They're feeling likenit's too much technology, too fast.,It may be good technology,,but I feel like there's not enoughnof a support structure.,There's not enough help.,There's not enough thoughtnput into the design of it,to make it easy and enjoyable to use.,One time I wrote a column about my effortsnto reach Dell Technical Support,,and within 12 hours,nthere were 700 messages,from readers on the feedback boardsnon the Times website,,from users saying,,""Me too, and here's my tale of woe.",I call it "software rage.",And man, let me tell you,,whoever figures out how to make moneynoff of this frustration will --,Oh, how did thatnget up there? Just kidding. 
 (Laughter) 
 Ok, so why is the problem accelerating?,And part of the problem is, ironically,,because the industrynhas put so much thought,into making things easier to use.,I'll show you what I mean.,This is what the computerninterface used to look like, DOS.,Over the years, it's gotten easier to use.,This is the original Mac operating system.,Reagan was President.nMadonna was still a brunette.,And the entire operating system --,this is the good part -- the entirenoperating system fit in 211 k.,You couldn't putnthe Mac OS X logo in 211 k! 
 (Laughter) 
 So the irony is, that as thesenthings became easier to use,,a less technical, broader audiencenwas coming into contact,with this equipment for the first time. 
 I once had the distinct privilegenof sitting in on the Apple call center,for a day.,The guy had a duplicate headsetnfor me to listen to.,And the calls that --nyou know how they say,,"Your call may be recordednfor quality assurance?",Uh-uh.,Your call may be recorded,so that they can collectnthe funniest dumb user stories,and pass them around on a CD. 
 (Laughter) 
 Which they do. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I have a copy. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's in your gift bag. No, no.,With your voices on it! 
 So, some of the stories are justnso classic, and yet so understandable.,A woman called Apple to complainnthat her mouse was squeaking.,Making a squeaking noise.,And the technician said, 
 "Well, ma'am, what do you meannyour mouse is squeaking?" 
 She says, "All I can tell younis that it squeaks louder,,the faster I move it across the screen." 
 (Laughter) 
 And the technician's like,,"Ma'am, you've got the mousenup against the screen?" 
 She goes, "Well, the message said,n'Click here to continue.'" 
 (Laughter) 
 Well, if you like that one --nhow much time have we got?,Another one, a guy called --nthis is absolutely true --,his computer had crashed,nand he told the technician,he couldn't restart it, no matternhow many times he typed "11.",And the technician said,n"What? Why are you typing 11?",He said, "The message says,n'Error Type 11.'" 
 (Laughter) 
 So, we must admit,that some of the blame falls squarelynat the feet of the users.,But why is the technical overload crisis,,the complexity crisis, accelerating now? 
 In the hardware world, it's becausenwe the consumers want,everything to be smaller,nsmaller, smaller.,So the gadgets are gettingntinier and tinier,,but our fingers are essentiallynstaying the same size.,So it gets to be more and morenof a challenge.,Software is subjectnto another primal force:,the mandate to releasenmore and more versions.,When you buy a piece of software,,it's not like buying a vasenor a candy bar, where you own it.,It's more like joining a club,nwhere you pay dues every year,,and every year, they say,,"We've added more features,nand we'll sell it to you for $99.",I know one guy who's spent $4,000njust on Photoshop over the years.,And software companies maken35 percent of their revenue,from just these software upgrades.,I call it the Software Upgrade Paradox --,which is that if you improvena piece of software enough times,,you eventually ruin it. 
 I mean, Microsoft Word was lastnjust a word processor in, you know,,the Eisenhower administration. 
 (Laughter) 
 But what's the alternative?,Microsoft actually did this experiment.,They said, "Well, wait a minute.,Everyone complains thatnwe're adding so many features.,Let's create a word processornthat's just a word processor:,Simple, pure; does not do web pages,nis not a database.",And it came out,nand it was called Microsoft Write.,And none of you are noddingnin acknowledgment, because it died.,It tanked. No one ever bought it.,I call this the Sport Utility Principle.,People like to surround themselvesnwith unnecessary power, right?,They don't need the databasenand the website, but they're like,,"Well, I'll upgrade, because, I might,nyou know, I might need that someday.",So the problem is: as you add morenfeatures, where are they going to go?,Where are you going to stick them?nYou only have so many design tools.,You can do buttons, you can donsliders, pop-up menus, sub-menus.,But if you're not carefulnabout how you choose,,you wind up with this. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is an un-retouched --nthis is not a joke --,un-retouched photo of Microsoft Word,,the copy that you have,nwith all the toolbars open.,You've obviously nevernopened all the toolbars,,but all you have to type innis this little, teeny window down here. 
 (Laughter) 
 And we've arrived at the agenof interface matrices,,where there are so manynfeatures and options,,you have to do two dimensions, you know:,a vertical and a horizontal.,You guys all complain,about how Microsoft Wordnis always bulleting your lists,and underlining your links automatically.,The off switch is in there somewhere.,I'm telling you -- it's there.,Part of the art of designingna simple, good interface,,is knowing when to usenwhich one of these features.,So, here is the log-offndialogue box for Windows 2000.,There are only four choices,,so why are they in a pop-up menu?,It's not like the rest of the screennis so full of other components,that you need to collapse the choices.,They could have put them all out in view. 
 Here's Apple's takenon the exact same dialogue box. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you -- yes, I designednthe dialogue box. No, no.,Already, we can seenthat Apple and Microsoft,have a severely divergentnapproach to software design.,Microsoft's approachnto simplicity tends to be:,let's break it down;nlet's just make it more steps.,There are these "wizards" everywhere.,And you know, there's a new versionnof Windows coming out this fall.,If they continue at this pace,nthere's absolutely no telling,where they might wind up. 
 [Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard] 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 "Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard.",Ok, I'll bite.,Let's click "Next" to continue. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 From the drop-down menu, choosenthe first letter you want to type. Ok. 
 (Laughter) 
 So there is a limitnthat we don't want to cross.,So what is the answer?,How do you pack in all these featuresnin a simple, intelligent way?,I believe in consistency, when possible,,real-world equivalents,,trash can folder, when possible,nlabel things, mostly.,But I beg of the designers here,to break all those rulesnif they violate the biggest rule of all,,which is intelligence.,Now what do I mean by that?,I'm going to give you some examples,where intelligence makes somethingnnot consistent, but it's better. 
 If you are buying something on the web,,you're supposed to put in your address,,and you're supposed to choosenwhat country you're from, ok?,There are 200 countries in the world.,We like to think of the Internetnas a global village.,I'm sorry; it's not one yet.,It's mainly like, the United States,nEurope, and Japan.,So why is "United States" in the "U"s? 
 (Laughter) 
 You have to scroll, like,nseven screensful to get to it.,Now, it would be inconsistentnto put "United States" first,,but it would be intelligent. 
 This one's been touched on before,,but why in God's name do younshut down a Windows PC,by clicking a button called "Start?" 
 (Laughter) 
 Here's another pet one of mine:nyou have a printer.,Most of the time, you want to printnone copy of your document,,in page order, on that printer.,So why in God's name do you seenthis every time you print?,It's like a 747 shuttle cockpit. 
 (Laughter) 
 And one of the buttons at the bottom,nyou'll notice, is not "Print." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Now, I'm not saying that Applenis the only company who has embraced,the cult of simplicity.,Palm is also, especially in the old days,nwonderful about this.,I actually got to speak to Palmnwhen they were flying high in the '90s,,and after the talk,nI met one of the employees.,He says, "Nice talk." And I said,n"Thank you. What do you do here?",He said, "I'm a tap counter."nI'm like, "You're a what?",He goes, "Well Jeff Hawkins,nthe CEO, says,,'If any task on the Palm Pilotntakes more than three taps of the stylus,,it's too long,nand it has to be redesigned.',So I'm the tap counter.",So, I'm going to show you an example,of a company that does notnhave a tap counter. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is Microsoft Word.,Ok, when you want to createna new blank document in Word --,it could happen. 
 (Laughter) 
 You go up to the "File" menunand you choose "New.",Now, what happens when you choose "New?",Do you get a new blank document?,You do not.,On the opposite side of the monitor,na task bar appears,,and somewhere in those links --nby the way, not at the top --,somewhere in those links is a buttonnthat makes you a new document.,Ok, so that is a companynnot counting taps.,You know, I don't want to just standnhere and make fun of Microsoft ...,Yes, I do. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 The Bill Gates song! 
 (Piano music) 
 I've been a geek forever,and I wrote the very first DOS.,I put my software and IBM together;,I got profit and they got the loss. 
 (Laughter) 
 I write the codenthat makes the whole world run.,I'm getting royalties from everyone.,Sometimes it's garbage,nbut the press is snowed.,You buy the box; I'll sell the code.,Every software companynis doing Microsoft's R&D.,You can't keep a good ideandown these days.,Even Windows is a hack.,We're kind of based loosely on the Mac.,So it's big, so it's slow.nYou've got nowhere to go.,I'm not doing this for praise.,I write the codenthat fits the world today.,Big mediocrity in every way.,We've entered planet domination mode.,You'll have no choice; you'll buy my code.,I am Bill Gates and I write the code. 
 (Applause) 
 But actually, I believenthere are really two Microsofts.,There's the old one, responsiblenfor Windows and Office.,They're dying to throw the whole thingnout and start fresh, but they can't.,They're locked in, because so many add-onsnand other company stuff,locks into the old 1982 chassis.,But there's also a new Microsoft,,that's really doing good,nsimple interface designs.,I liked the Media Center PC.,I liked the Microsoft SPOT Watch.,The Wireless Watchnflopped miserably in the market,,but it wasn't because it wasn'tnsimply and beautifully designed.,But let's put it this way:,would you pay $10 a month to have a watch,that has to be rechargednevery night like your cell phone,,and stops workingnwhen you leave your area code? 
 (Laughter) 
 So, the signs might indicate,that the complexity crunchnis only going to get worse.,So is there any hope?,The screens are getting smaller,npeople are illuminating,,putting manuals in the boxes,,things are coming out at a faster pace.,It's funny -- when Steve Jobsncame back to Apple in 1997,,after 12 years away,nit was the MacWorld Expo --,he came to the stagenin that black turtleneck and jeans,,and he sort of did this.,The crowd went wild,nbut I had just seen --,I'm like, where have I seen this before?,I had just seen the movie "Evita" -- 
 (Laughter) 
 with Madonna,,and I'm like, you know what?,I've got to do one about Steve Jobs. 
 (Music) 
 It won't be easy.nYou'll think I'm strange. 
 (Laughter) 
 When I try to explain why I'm back,,after telling the pressnApple's future is black.,You won't believe me.,All that you see is a kid in his teensnwho started out in a garage,with only a buddy named Woz. 
 (Laughter) 
 You try rhyming with garage! 
 (Laughter) 
 Don't cry for me, Cupertino. 
 (Laughter) 
 The truth is, I never left you.,I know the ropes now,nknow what the tricks are.,I made a fortune over at Pixar. 
 (Laughter) 
 Don't cry for me, Cupertino.,I've still got the drive and vision.,I still wear sandals in any weather.,It's just that these days,,they're Gucci leather. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 So Steve Jobs had always believednin simplicity and elegance and beauty.,And the truth is,,for years I was a little depressed,,because Americansnobviously did not value it,,because the Mac hadnthree percent market share,,Windows had 95 percent market share --,people did not think it was worthnputting a price on it.,So I was a little depressed.,And then I heard Al Gore's talk,,and I realized I didn't knownthe meaning of depressed. 
 (Laughter) 
 But it turns out I was wrong, right?,Because the iPod came out,,and it violated every bitnof common wisdom.,Other products cost less;nother products had more features,,they had voice recordersnand FM transmitters.,The other products were backednby Microsoft, with an open standard,,not Apple's propriety standard.,But the iPod won --nthis is the one they wanted.,The lesson was: simplicity sells.,And there are signs that the industrynis getting the message.,This is a little company that's donenvery well with simplicity and elegance.,The Sonos thing -- it's catching on. 
 I've got just a couple examples.,Physically, a really cool,nelegant thinking coming along lately.,When you have a digital camera,,how do you get the picturesnback to your computer?,Well, you either haul around a USB cable,,or you buy a card readernand haul that around.,Either one, you're going to lose.,What I do is, I take out the memory card,,and I fold it in half,nrevealing USB contacts.,I just stick it in the computer,noffload the pictures,,put it right back in the camera.,I never have to lose anything.,Here's another example.,Chris, you're the source of all power.nWill you be my power plug? 
 Chris Anderson: Oh yeah.nDP: Hold that and don't let go.,You might've seen this,nthis is Apple's new laptop.,This the power cord.nIt hooks on like this.,And I'm sure every one of you has donenthis at some point in your lives,,or one of your children.,You walk along -- and I'mnabout to pull this onto the floor.,I don't care. It's a loaner.,Here we go. Whoa!,It's magnetic -- it doesn't pullnthe laptop onto the floor. 
 (Applause) 
 In my very last example --,I do a lot of my worknusing speech recognition software.,And I'll just --nyou have to be kind of quiet,because the software is nervous.,Speech recognitionnsoftware is really great,for doing emails very quickly; period.,Like, I get hundreds of themna day; period.,And it's not just what I dictatenthat it writes down; period.,I also use this featurencalled voice macros; period.,Correct "dissuade.",Not "just.",Ok, this is not an ideal situation,,because it's getting the echonfrom the hall and stuff.,The point is, I can respond to peoplenvery quickly by saying a short word,,and having it write outna much longer thing.,So if somebodynsends me a fan letter, I'll say,,"Thanks for that." 
 [Thank you so muchnfor taking the time to write ...] 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 And conversely, if somebodynsends me hate mail --,which happens daily --,I say, "Piss off." 
 (Laughter) 
 [I admire your frankness ...] 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 So that's my dirty little secret.nDon't tell anyone. 
 (Laughter) 
 So the point is --nthis is a really interesting story.,This is version eight of this software,,and do you know what they putnin version eight?,No new features. It's nevernhappened before in software!,The company put no new features.,They just said, "We'll makenthis software work right." Right?,Because for years, people had boughtnthis software, tried it out --,95 percent accuracy was all they got,,which means one in 20 words is wrong --,and they'd put it in their drawer.,And the company got sick of that,,so they said, "This version,nwe're not going to do anything,,but make sure it's darned accurate.",And so that's what they did. 
 This cult of doing things rightnis starting to spread.,So, my final advice for those of younwho are consumers of this technology:,remember, if it doesn't work,nit's not necessarily you, ok?,It could be the designnof the thing you're using.,Be aware in lifenof good design and bad design.,And if you're among the peoplenwho create this stuff:,Easy is hard.,Pre-sweat the details for your audience.,Count the taps.,Remember, the hard partnis not deciding what features to add,,it's deciding what to leave out.,And best of all, your motivation is:nsimplicity sells. 
 CA: Bravo. DP: Thank you very much. 
 CA: Hear, hear! 
 (Applause)I'd like to talk todaynabout the two biggest social trends,in the coming century,,and perhaps in the next 10,000 years.,But I want to startnwith my work on romantic love,,because that's my most recent work.,What I and my colleagues did was putn32 people, who were madly in love,,into a functional MRI brain scanner.,17 who were madly in lovenand their love was accepted;,and 15 who were madly in lovenand they had just been dumped.,And so I want to tell younabout that first,,and then go on into wherenI think love is going. 
 (Laughter) 
 "What 'tis to love?" Shakespeare said.,I think our ancestors --,I think human beings have beennwondering about this question,since they sat around their campfires,or lay and watchednthe stars a million years ago.,I started out by trying to figure outnwhat romantic love was,by looking at the last 45 yearsnof the psychological research,and as it turns out,,there's a very specific group of thingsnthat happen when you fall in love.,The first thing that happens is,,a person begins to take onnwhat I call, "special meaning.",As a truck driver once said to me,,"The world had a new center,nand that center was Mary Anne." 
 George Bernard Shaw said it differently.,"Love consists of overestimatingnthe differences,between one woman and another.",And indeed, that's what we do. 
 (Laughter) 
 And then you just focus on this person.,You can list what youndon't like about them,,but then you sweep that asidenand focus on what you do.,As Chaucer said, "Love is blind." 
 In trying to understand romantic love,,I decided I would read poetrynfrom all over the world,,and I just want to givenyou one very short poem,from eighth-century China,,because it's an almost perfect example,of a man who is focused totallynon a particular woman.,It's a little bit like when you arenmadly in love with somebody,and you walk into a parking lot --,their car is differentnfrom every other car in the parking lot.,Their wine glass at dinner,is different from every other wine glassnat the dinner party.,And in this case, a man got hookednon a bamboo sleeping mat. 
 And it goes like this.,It's by a guy called Yuan Zhen.,"I cannot bear to put awaynthe bamboo sleeping mat.,The night I brought you home,nI watched you roll it out.",He became hooked on a sleeping mat,,probably because of elevated activitynof dopamine in his brain,,just like with you and me. 
 But anyway, not only does this personntake on special meaning,,you focus your attention on them.,You aggrandize them.,But you have intense energy.,As one Polynesian said,n"I felt like jumping in the sky.",You're up all night.nYou're walking till dawn.,You feel intense elationnwhen things are going well;,mood swings into horrible despairnwhen things are going poorly.,Real dependence on this person.,As one businessman in New York said to me,,"Anything she liked, I liked.",Simple. Romantic love is very simple. 
 You become extremely sexually possessive.,You know, if you're just sleepingnwith somebody casually,,you don't really carenif they're sleeping with somebody else.,But the moment you fall in love,,you become extremelynsexually possessive of them.,I think there's a Darwiniannpurpose to this.,The whole point of thisnis to pull two people together,strongly enough to beginnto rear babies as a team. 
 But the main characteristicsnof romantic love are craving:,an intense cravingnto be with a particular person,,not just sexually, but emotionally.,It would be nice to go to bed with them,,but you want them to call younon the telephone, to invite you out, etc.,,to tell you that they love you.,The other main characteristicnis motivation.,The motor in the brain begins to crank,nand you want this person. 
 And last but not least,nit is an obsession.,Before I put these peoplenin the MRI machine,,I would ask them all kinds of questions.,But my most important questionnwas always the same.,It was: "What percentage of the daynand night do you think about this person?",And indeed, they would say,,"All day. All night.,I can never stop thinkingnabout him or her." 
 And then, the very last question --,I would always have to worknmyself up to this question,,because I'm not a psychologist.,I don't work with peoplenin any kind of traumatic situation.,My final question was always the same.,I would say,n"Would you die for him or her?",And, indeed, these people would say "Yes!",as if I had asked them to pass the salt.,I was just staggered by it. 
 So we scanned their brains,,looking at a photographnof their sweetheart,and looking at a neutral photograph,,with a distraction task in between.,So we could look at the same brainnwhen it was in that heightened state,and when it was in a resting state.,And we found activitynin a lot of brain regions.,In fact, one of the most importantnwas a brain region,that becomes activenwhen you feel the rush of cocaine.,And indeed, that's exactly what happens. 
 I began to realize that romantic lovenis not an emotion.,In fact, I had always thoughtnit was a series of emotions,,from very high to very low.,But actually, it's a drive.,It comes from the motor of the mind,,the wanting part of the mind,nthe craving part of the mind.,The kind of part of the mind,when you're reachingnfor that piece of chocolate,,when you want to winnthat promotion at work.,The motor of the brain.,It's a drive. 
 And in fact, I think it's more powerfulnthan the sex drive.,You know, if you ask somebodynto go to bed with you,,and they say, "No, thank you,",you certainly don't kill yourselfnor slip into a clinical depression.,But certainly, around the world,,people who are rejectednin love will kill for it.,People live for love.,They kill for love.,They die for love.,They have songs, poems, novels,,sculptures, paintings, myths, legends.,In over 175 societies,,people have left their evidencenof this powerful brain system.,I have come to think,it's one of the most powerfulnbrain systems on Earth,for both great joy and great sorrow. 
 And I've also come to think,that it's one of threenbasically different brain systems,that evolved from mating and reproduction.,One is the sex drive:nthe craving for sexual gratification.,W.H. Auden called itnan "intolerable neural itch,",and indeed, that's what it is.,It keeps bothering youna little bit, like being hungry.,The second of these three brainnsystems is romantic love:,that elation, obsession of early love.,And the third brain system is attachment:,that sense of calm and securitynyou can feel for a long-term partner. 
 And I think that the sex drivenevolved to get you out there,,looking for a whole range of partners.,You can feel it when you're justndriving along in your car.,It can be focused on nobody.,I think romantic love evolvednto enable you to focus your mating energy,on just one individual at a time,,thereby conserving mating time and energy.,And I think that attachment,nthe third brain system,,evolved to enable you to toleratenthis human being,at least long enough to raisena child together as a team.,So with that preamble,,I want to go into discussingnthe two most profound social trends.,One of the last 10,000 years,and the other,ncertainly of the last 25 years,,that are going to have an impactnon these three different brain systems:,lust, romantic lovenand deep attachment to a partner. 
 The first is women working,nmoving into the workforce.,I've looked at 130 societies,through the demographic yearbooksnof the United Nations.,Everywhere in the world,n129 out of 130 of them,,women are not only movingninto the job market --,sometimes very, very slowly,nbut they are moving into the job market --,and they are very slowly closingnthat gap between men and women,in terms of economic power,nhealth and education.,It's very slow. 
 For every trend on this planet,nthere's a counter-trend.,We all know of them, but nevertheless --,the Arabs say, "The dogs may bark,nbut the caravan moves on.",And, indeed, that caravan is moving on.,Women are moving back into the job market.,And I say back into the job market,nbecause this is not new.,For millions of years,non the grasslands of Africa,,women commuted to worknto gather their vegetables.,They came home with 60 to 80 percentnof the evening meal.,The double income family was the standard.,And women were regardednas just as economically,,socially and sexually powerful as men.,In short, we're reallynmoving forward to the past. 
 Then, women's worstninvention was the plow.,With the beginning of plow agriculture,nmen's roles became extremely powerful.,Women lost their ancientnjobs as collectors,,but then with the industrial revolutionnand the post-industrial revolution,they're moving back into the job market.,In short, they are acquiring the statusnthat they had a million years ago,,10,000 years ago, 100,000 years ago.,We are seeing now onenof the most remarkable traditions,in the history of the human animal.,And it's going to have an impact. 
 I generally give a whole lecture,on the impact of womennon the business community.,I'll say just a couple of things,nand then go on to sex and love.,There's a lot of gender differences;,anybody who thinks men and women are alike,simply never had a boy and a girl child.,I don't know why they want to thinknthat men and women are alike.,There's much we have in common,,but there's a whole lotnthat we do not have in common. 
 We are -- in the words of Ted Hughes,,"I think that we are like two feet.nWe need each other to get ahead.",But we did not evolvento have the same brain.,And we're finding more and morengender differences in the brain.,I'll only just use a couplenand then move on to sex and love.,One of them is women's verbal ability.,Women can talk. 
 Women's ability to find the right wordnrapidly, basic articulation,goes up in the middlenof the menstrual cycle,,when estrogen levels peak.,But even at menstruation,nthey're better than the average man.,Women can talk.,They've been doing it for a million years;nwords were women's tools.,They held that babynin front of their face,,cajoling it, reprimanding it,neducating it with words.,And, indeed, they're becomingna very powerful force. 
 Even in places like India and Japan,,where women are not moving rapidlyninto the regular job market,,they're moving into journalism.,And I think that the televisionnis like the global campfire.,We sit around it and it shapes our minds.,Almost always, when I'm on TV,nthe producer who calls me,,who negotiates what we're going to say,,is a woman.,In fact, Solzhenitsyn once said,,"To have a great writernis to have another government." 
 Today 54 percent of peoplenwho are writers in America are women.,It's one of many, manyncharacteristics that women have,that they will bring into the job market.,They've got incredible people skills,nnegotiating skills.,They're highly imaginative.,We now know the brain circuitrynof imagination, of long-term planning.,They tend to be web thinkers.,Because the female partsnof the brain are better connected,,they tend to collect morenpieces of data when they think,,put them into more complex patterns,nsee more options and outcomes.,They tend to be contextual,nholistic thinkers,,what I call web thinkers. 
 Men tend to -- and these are averages --,tend to get rid of what they regardnas extraneous,,focus on what they do,,and move in a morenstep-by-step thinking pattern.,They're both perfectly goodnways of thinking.,We need both of them to get ahead.,In fact, there's many morenmale geniuses in the world.,And there's also many morenmale idiots in the world. 
 (Laughter) 
 When the male brain works well,nit works extremely well.,And what I really thinknthat we're doing is,,we're moving towardsna collaborative society,,a society in which the talentsnof both men and women,are becoming understoodnand valued and employed. 
 But in fact, women movingninto the job market,is having a huge impactnon sex and romance and family life.,Foremost, women are startingnto express their sexuality.,I'm always astonishednwhen people come to me and say,,"Why is it that men are so adulterous?","Why do you thinknmore men are adulterous than women?","Well, men are more adulterous!",And I say, "Who do you thinknthese men are sleeping with?" 
 (Laughter) 
 And -- basic math! 
 Anyway.,In the Western world,,women start sooner at sex,nhave more partners,,express less remorsenfor the partners that they do,,marry later, have fewer children,,leave bad marriagesnin order to get good ones.,We are seeing the risenof female sexual expression.,And, indeed, once again we're movingnforward to the kind of sexual expression,that we probably saw on the grasslandsnof Africa a million years ago,,because this is the kindnof sexual expression that we see,in hunting and gathering societies today. 
 We're also returningnto an ancient form of marriage equality.,They're now saying that the 21st century,is going to be the century of whatnthey call the "symmetrical marriage,",or the "pure marriage,"nor the "companionate marriage.",This is a marriage between equals,,moving forward to a pattern,that is highly compatiblenwith the ancient human spirit. 
 We're also seeing a rise of romantic love.,91 percent of American womennand 86 percent of American men,would not marry somebodynwho had every single quality,they were looking for in a partner,,if they were not in love with that person.,People around the world,nin a study of 37 societies,,want to be in lovenwith the person that they marry.,Indeed, arranged marriages arenon their way off this braid of human life. 
 I even think that marriagesnmight even become more stable,because of the second great world trend.,The first one being womennmoving into the job market,,the second one beingnthe aging world population.,They're now saying that in America,,that middle age should be regardednas up to age 85.,Because in that highestnage category of 76 to 85,,as much as 40 percent of peoplenhave nothing really wrong with them.,So we're seeing there's a realnextension of middle age. 
 For one of my books,nI looked at divorce data in 58 societies.,And as it turns out, the older you get,nthe less likely you are to divorce.,So the divorce rate right nownis stable in America,,and it's actually beginning to decline.,It may decline some more.,I would even say that with Viagra,,estrogen replacement, hip replacements,and the incredibly interesting women,-- women have never beennas interesting as they are now.,Not at any time on this planetnhave women been so educated,,so interesting, so capable.,And so I honestly think that if therenreally was ever a time in human evolution,when we have the opportunity to makengood marriages, that time is now. 
 However, there's always kindsnof complications in this.,These three brain systems --nlust, romantic love and attachment --,don't always go together.,They can go together, by the way.,That's why casual sex isn't so casual.,With orgasm you get a spike of dopamine.,Dopamine's associated with romantic love,,and you can justnfall in love with somebody,who you're just having casual sex with.,With orgasm, then you get a real rushnof oxytocin and vasopressin --,those are associated with attachment.,This is why you can feel such a sensenof cosmic union with somebody,after you've made love to them. 
 But these three brain systems:nlust, romantic love and attachment,,aren't always connected to each other.,You can feel deep attachmentnto a long-term partner,while you feel intensenromantic love for somebody else,,while you feel the sex drive for peoplenunrelated to these other partners.,In short, we're capable of lovingnmore than one person at a time.,In fact, you can lie in bed at night,and swing from deep feelingsnof attachment for one person,to deep feelingsnof romantic love for somebody else.,It's as if there's a committee meetingngoing on in your head,as you are trying to decide what to do.,So I don't think, honestly,,we're an animalnthat was built to be happy;,we are an animalnthat was built to reproduce.,I think the happiness we find, we make.,And I think, however,,we can make good relationshipsnwith each other. 
 So I want to conclude with two things.,I want to conclude with a worry,,and with a wonderful story.,The worry is about antidepressants.,Over 100 million prescriptionsnof antidepressants,are written every yearnin the United States.,And these drugs are going generic.,They are seeping around the world.,I know one girl who's beennon these antidepressants,,SSRIs, serotonin-enhancingnantidepressants -- since she was 13.,She's 23. She's been on themnever since she was 13. 
 I've got nothing against peoplenwho take them short term,,when they're goingnthrough something horrible.,They want to commit suicidenor kill somebody else.,I would recommend it.,But more and more peoplenin the United States,are taking them long term.,And indeed, what these drugs donis raise levels of serotonin.,And by raising levels of serotonin,nyou suppress the dopamine circuit.,Everybody knows that.,Dopamine is associated with romantic love.,Not only do they suppressnthe dopamine circuit,,but they kill the sex drive.,And when you kill the sex drive,nyou kill orgasm.,And when you kill orgasm,,you kill that flood of drugsnassociated with attachment.,The things are connected in the brain.,And when you tamper with one brain system,,you're going to tamper with another.,I'm just simply saying that a worldnwithout love is a deadly place. 
 So now -- 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 I want to end with a story.,And then, just a comment.,I've been studying romantic lovenand sex and attachment for 30 years.,I'm an identical twin;nI am interested in why we're all alike.,Why you and I are alike,nwhy the Iraqis and the Japanese,and the Australian Aboriginesnand the people of the Amazon River,are all alike.,And about a year ago,,an Internet dating service,nMatch.com, came to me,and asked me if I would designna new dating site for them.,I said, "I don't know anythingnabout personality. You know?,I don't know. Do you thinknyou've got the right person?",They said, "Yes.",It got me thinkingnabout why it is that you fall in love,with one person rather than another. 
 That's my current project;nit will be my next book.,There's all kinds of reasons,that you fall in lovenwith one person rather than another.,Timing is important.nProximity is important.,Mystery is important.,You fall in love with somebodynwho's somewhat mysterious,,in part because mysterynelevates dopamine in the brain,,probably pushes younover that threshold to fall in love.,You fall in love with somebody,who fits withinnwhat I call your "love map,",an unconscious list of traits,that you build in childhoodnas you grow up.,And I also thinknthat you gravitate to certain people,,actually, with somewhatncomplementary brain systems.,And that's what I'm nowncontributing to this. 
 But I want to tell youna story, to illustrate.,I've been carrying on herenabout the biology of love.,I wanted to show you a little bitnabout the culture of it, too,,the magic of it.,It's a story that was told to me,by somebody who hadnheard it just from one --,probably a true story.,It was a graduate student --nI'm at Rutgers and my two colleagues --,Art Aron is at SUNY Stony Brook.,That's where we put our peoplenin the MRI machine. 
 And this graduate student was madlynin love with another graduate student,,and she was not in love with him.,And they werenall at a conference in Beijing.,And he knew from our work,that if you go and do somethingnvery novel with somebody,,you can drive upnthe dopamine in the brain,,and perhaps triggernthis brain system for romantic love. 
 (Laughter) 
 So he decided he'd put science to work.,And he invited this girl to go offnon a rickshaw ride with him. 
 And sure enough -- I've never been in one,,but apparently they gonall around the buses and the trucks,and it's crazy and it's noisynand it's exciting.,He figured that thisnwould drive up the dopamine,,and she'd fall in love with him.,So off they go and she's squealingnand squeezing him,and laughing and having a wonderful time.,An hour later they get downnoff of the rickshaw,,and she throws her hands up and she says,,"Wasn't that wonderful?",And, "Wasn't that rickshawndriver handsome!" 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 There's magic to love! 
 (Applause) 
 But I will end by sayingnthat millions of years ago,,we evolved three basic drives:,the sex drive, romantic love,and attachment to a long-term partner.,These circuits are deeplynembedded in the human brain.,They're going to survivenas long as our species survives,on what Shakespeare calledn"this mortal coil." 
 Thank you. 
 Chris Anderson: Helen Fisher! 
 (Applause)On September 10, the morningnof my seventh birthday,,I came downstairs to the kitchen,nwhere my mother was washing the dishes,and my father was readingnthe paper or something,,and I sort of presented myself to themnin the doorway, and they said,,"Hey, happy birthday!"nAnd I said, "I'm seven.",And my father smiled and said,,"Well, you knownwhat that means, don't you?",And I said, "Yeah,nthat I'm going to have a party,and a cake and get a lot of presents?",And my dad said, "Well, yes.,But more importantly,,being seven means thatnyou've reached the age of reason,,and you're now capable of committingnany and all sins against God and man." 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, I had heard this phrase,n"age of reason," before.,Sister Mary Kevinnhad been bandying it about,my second-grade class at school.,But when she said it,,the phrase seemed all caught upnin the excitement of preparations,for our first communionnand our first confession,,and everybody knew that was reallynall about the white dress,and the white veil.,And anyway, I hadn't really paidnall that much attention,to that phrase, "age of reason.",So, I said, "Yeah, yeah, age of reason.nWhat does that mean again?",And my dad said, "Well, we believe,nin the Catholic Church,,that God knows that little kids don't knownthe difference between right and wrong,,but when you're seven,nyou're old enough to know better.,So, you've grown upnand reached the age of reason,,and now God will startnkeeping notes on you,,and begin your permanent record." 
 (Laughter) 
 And I said, "Oh ...,Wait a minute.,You mean all that time, up till today,,all that time I was so good,nGod didn't notice it?",And my mom said, "Well, I noticed it." 
 (Laughter) 
 And I thought, "How couldnI not have known this before?,How could it not have sunk innwhen they'd been telling me?,All that being goodnand no real credit for it.,And worst of all,nhow could I not have realized,this very important information,until the very daynthat it was basically useless to me?",So I said, "Well, Mom and Dad,nwhat about Santa Claus?,I mean, Santa Claus knowsnif you're naughty or nice, right?",And my dad said, "Yeah, but, honey,,I think that's technically justnbetween Thanksgiving and Christmas.",And my mother said, "Oh, Bob, stop it.nLet's just tell her. I mean, she's seven.,Julie, there is no Santa Claus." 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, this was actuallynnot that upsetting to me.,My parents had this wholenelaborate story about Santa Claus:,how they had talked to Santa Clausnhimself and agreed,that instead of Santandelivering our presents,over the night of Christmas Eve,,like he did for every other familynwho got to open their surprises,first thing Christmas morning,,our family would give Santa more time.,Santa would come to our housenwhile we were at nine o'clock high mass,on Christmas morning, but onlynif all of us kids did not make a fuss.,Which made me very suspicious.,It was pretty obvious that it was reallynour parents giving us the presents.,I mean, my dad had a veryndistinctive wrapping style,,and my mother's handwritingnwas so close to Santa's. 
 (Laughter) 
 Plus, why would Santa save timenby having to loop back,to our house after he'd gonento everybody else's?,There was only one obvious conclusionnto reach from this mountain of evidence:,our family was too strange and weirdnfor even Santa Claus to come visit,,and my poor parents were tryingnto protect us from the embarrassment,,this humiliation of rejectionnby Santa, who was jolly --,but let's face it,nhe was also very judgmental.,So to find out that there wasnno Santa Claus at all,was actually sort of a relief. 
 I left the kitchen not reallynin shock about Santa,,but rather, I was just dumbfounded,about how I could have missednthis whole age of reason thing.,It was too late for me,nbut maybe I could help someone else,,someone who could use the information.,They had to fit two criteria:,they had to be old enoughnto be able to understand,the whole concept of the agenof reason, and not yet seven.,The answer was clear:nmy brother Bill. He was six.,Well, I finally found Bill,about a block away from our housenat this public school playground.,It was a Saturday,nand he was all by himself,,just kicking a ballnagainst the side of a wall.,I ran up to him and said, "Bill!,I just realized that the age of reasonnstarts when you turn seven,,and then you're capablenof committing any and all sins,against God and man.",And Bill said, "So?",And I said, "So, you're six.,You have a whole year to do anythingnyou want to and God won't notice it.",And he said, "So?",And I said, "So? So everything!",And I turned to run.nI was so angry with him.,But when I got to the top of the steps,,I turned around dramatically and said,,"Oh, by the way, Bill --nthere is no Santa Claus." 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, I didn't know it at the time,,but I really wasn't turning sevennon September 10th.,For my 13th birthday,,I planned a slumber partynwith all of my girlfriends,,but a couple of weeks beforehandnmy mother took me aside and said,,"I need to speak to you privately.,September 10th is not your birthday.nIt's October 10th.",And I said, "What?" 
 (Laughter) 
 And she said ... 
 (Laughter) 
 "Listen. The cut-off date to startnkindergarten was September 15th." 
 (Laughter) 
 "So I told them that your birthdaynwas September 10th,,and then I wasn't sure,that you weren't just going to gonblab it all over the place,,so I started to tell younyour birthday was September 10th.,But, Julie, you were so ready to startnschool, honey. You were so ready.",I thought about it, and when I was four,,I was already the oldest of four children,,and my mother even hadnanother child to come,,so what I think she --nunderstandably -- really meant,was that she was so ready,nshe was so ready.,Then she said, "Don't worry, Julie.,Every year on October 10th,,when it was your birthdaynbut you didn't realize it,,I made sure that you atena piece of cake that day." 
 (Laughter) 
 Which was comforting, but troubling.,My mother had been celebratingnmy birthday with me, without me. 
 (Laughter) 
 What was so upsettingnabout this new piece of information,was not that I had to changenthe date of my slumber party,with all of my girlfriends.,What was most upsettingnwas that this meant I was not a Virgo.,I had a huge Virgo poster in my bedroom.,And I read my horoscope every single day,,and it was so totally me. 
 (Laughter) 
 And this meant that I was a Libra?,So, I took the bus downtownnto get the new Libra poster.,The Virgo poster is a picturenof a beautiful woman with long hair,,sort of lounging by some water,,but the Libra poster is just a huge scale.,This was around the timenthat I started filling out physically,,and I was filling out a lot morenthan a lot of the other girls,,and frankly, the whole ideanthat my astrological sign was a scale,just seemed ominous and depressing. 
 (Laughter) 
 But I got the new Libra poster,,and I started to readnmy new Libra horoscope,,and I was astonished to findnthat it was also totally me. 
 (Laughter) 
 It wasn't until years later, looking back,on this whole age-of-reason,nchange-of-birthday thing,,that it dawned on me:,I wasn't turning sevennwhen I thought I turned seven.,I had a whole other month,to do anything I wanted tonbefore God started keeping tabs on me.,Oh, life can be so cruel.,One day, two Mormonnmissionaries came to my door.,Now, I just live off a mainnthoroughfare in Los Angeles,,and my block is -- well,nit's a natural beginning,for people who are peddlingnthings door to door.,Sometimes I get little old ladiesnfrom the Seventh Day Adventist Church,showing me these cartoonnpictures of heaven.,And sometimes I getnteenagers who promise me,that they won't join a gangnand just start robbing people,,if I only buy somenmagazine subscriptions from them.,So normally, I just ignore the doorbell,nbut on this day, I answered.,And there stood two boys, each about 19,nin white, starched short-sleeved shirts,,and they had little name tags,that identified themnas official representatives,of the Church of Jesus Christnof Latter-day Saints,,and they said they hadna message for me, from God.,I said, "A message for me? From God?"nAnd they said, "Yes.",Now, I was raisednin the Pacific Northwest,,around a lot of Church of Latter-daynSaints people and, you know,,I've worked with them and even dated them,,but I never really knew the doctrine,,or what they said to peoplenwhen they were out on a mission,,and I guess I was sort of curious,nso I said, "Well, please, come in.",And they looked really happy,,because I don't think this happensnto them all that often. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I sat them down,nand I got them glasses of water --,Ok, I got it, I got it.,I got them glasses of water.,Don't touch my hair, that's the thing. 
 (Laughter) 
 You can't put a videonof myself in front of me,and expect me not to fix my hair.,Ok. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I sat them downnand I got them glasses of water,,and after niceties, they said,,"Do you believe that God loves younwith all his heart?",And I thought, "Well,nof course I believe in God,,but you know, I don't likenthat word 'heart,',because it anthropomorphizes God,,and I don't like the word, 'his,'neither, because that sexualizes God.",But I didn't want to arguensemantics with these boys,,so after a very long,nuncomfortable pause, I said,,"Yes, yes, I do. I feel very loved.",And they looked at each other and smiled,,like that was the right answer.,And then they said, "Do you believe,that we're all brothersnand sisters on this planet?",And I said, "Yes, I do.",And I was so relieved that it wasna question I could answer so quickly.,And they said, "Well, thennwe have a story to tell you." 
 And they told me this storynall about this guy named Lehi,,who lived in Jerusalem in 600 BC.,Now, apparently in Jerusalem in 600 BC,neveryone was completely bad and evil.,Every single one of them:nman, woman, child, infant, fetus.,And God came to Lehi and said to him,,"Put your family on a boatnand I will lead you out of here.",And God did lead them.,He led them to America.,I said, "America? 
 (Laughter) 
 From Jerusalem to Americanby boat in 600 BC?",And they said, "Yes." 
 (Laughter) 
 Then they told menhow Lehi and his descendants,reproduced and reproduced,nand over the course of 600 years,,there were two great races of them,nthe Nephites and the Lamanites,,and the Nephites were totally good --neach and every one of them --,and the Lamanitesnwere totally bad and evil --,every single one of themnjust bad to the bone. 
 Then, after Jesus diednon the cross for our sins,,on his way up to heaven,,he stopped by Americanand visited the Nephites. 
 (Laughter) 
 And he told them that if they all remainedntotally, totally good --,each and every one of them --,they would win the warnagainst the evil Lamanites.,But apparently somebody blew it,,because the Lamanitesnwere able to kill all the Nephites.,All but one guy, this guy named Mormon,,who managed to survivenby hiding in the woods.,And he made surenthis whole story was written down,in reformed Egyptian hieroglyphicsnchiseled onto gold plates,,which he then buriednnear Palmyra, New York. 
 (Laughter) 
 Well, I was just on the edge of my seat. 
 (Laughter) 
 I said, "What happened to the Lamanites?",And they said, "Well, they becamenour Native Americans, here in the U.S.",And I said, "So, you believenthe Native Americans are descended,from a people who were totally evil?",And they said, "Yes.",Then they told menhow this guy named Joseph Smith,found those buried gold platesnright in his backyard,,and he also found this magic stonenback there that he put into his hat,and then buried his face into,,and this allowed himnto translate the gold plates,from the reformed Egyptian into English. 
 Well, at this point I just wanted to giventhese two boys some advice,about their pitch. 
 (Laughter) 
 I wanted to say -- 
 (Applause) 
 "Ok, don't start with this story." 
 (Laughter) 
 I mean, even the Scientologists,know to start with a personality testnbefore they start -- 
 (Applause) 
 telling people all about Xenu,nthe evil intergalactic overlord.,Then, they said, "Do you believenthat God speaks to us,through his righteous prophets?",And I said, "No, I don't,",because I was sort of upsetnabout this Lamanite story,and this crazy gold plate story,,but the truth was,nI hadn't really thought this through,,so I backpedaled a little and I said,,"Well, what exactlyndo you mean by 'righteous'?,And what do you mean by prophets?nLike, could the prophets be women?",And they said, "No." And I said, "Why?",And they said, "Well, it's becausenGod gave women a gift,that is so spectacular,,it is so wonderful, that the only giftnhe had left over to give men,was the gift of prophecy.",What is this wonderful giftnGod gave women, I wondered?,Maybe their greater abilitynto cooperate and adapt? 
 (Laughter) 
 Women's longer lifespan?,The fact that women tend to benmuch less violent than men?,But no -- it wasn't any of these gifts.,They said, "Well, it's her abilitynto bear children.",I said, "Oh, come on.,I mean, even if womenntried to have a baby every single year,from the time they were 15nto the time they were 45,,assuming they didn't die from exhaustion,,it still seems like some womennwould have some time left over,to hear the word of God.",And they said, "No." 
 (Laughter) 
 Well, then they didn't look sonfresh-faced and cute to me any more,,but they had more to say.,They said, "Well, we also believenthat if you're a Mormon,,and if you're in good standingnwith the church,,when you die, you get to go to heaven,and be with your family for all eternity.",And I said, "Oh, dear. 
 (Laughter) 
 That wouldn't bensuch a good incentive for me." 
 (Laughter) 
 And they said, "Oh. 
 (Laughter) 
 Hey! Well, we also believenthat when you go to heaven,,you get your body restored to younin its best original state.,Like, if you'd lost a leg,nwell, you get it back.,Or, if you'd gone blind, you could see.",I said, "Oh. Now, I don't have a uterus,,because I had cancer a few years ago.,So does this meannthat if I went to heaven,,I would get my old uterus back?",And they said, "Sure.",And I said, "I don't want it back.nI'm happy without it." Gosh.,What if you had a nose jobnand you liked it? 
 (Laughter) 
 Would God force younto get your old nose back?,Then they gave me this Book of Mormon,,told me to readnthis chapter and that chapter,,and said they'd come backnand check in on me,,and I think I said somethingnlike, "Please don't hurry,",or maybe just, "Please don't,"nand they were gone. 
 Ok, so I initially feltnreally superior to these boys,,and smug in my more conventional faith.,But then the more I thought about it,nthe more I had to be honest with myself.,If someone came to my door,and I was hearing Catholic theologynand dogma for the very first time,,and they said, "We believe that Godnimpregnated a very young girl,without the use of intercourse,,and the fact that she was a virginnis maniacally important to us." 
 (Laughter) 
 "And she had a baby,nand that's the son of God,",I mean, I would thinknthat's equally ridiculous.,I'm just so used to that story. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, I couldn't let myself feelncondescending towards these boys.,But the question they asked menwhen they first arrived,really stuck in my head:,Did I believe that Godnloved me with all his heart?,Because I wasn't exactly surenhow I felt about that question.,Now, if they had asked me,,"Do you feel that God lovesnyou with all his heart?",Well, that would have been much different,nI think I would have instantly answered,,"Yes, yes, I feel it all the time.,I feel God's lovenwhen I'm hurt and confused,,and I feel consoled and cared for.,I take shelter in God's love whennI don't understand why tragedy hits,,and I feel God's love when I looknwith gratitude at all the beauty I see.",But since they asked me that questionnwith the word "believe" in it,,somehow it was all different,,because I wasn't exactly surenif I believed what I so clearly felt.Thank you so much, Chris.,And it's truly a great honornto have the opportunity,to come to this stage twice;nI'm extremely grateful.,I have been blown away by this conference,,and I want to thank all of younfor the many nice comments,about what I had to say the other night.,And I say that sincerely,,partly because (Mock sob),I need that. 
 (Laughter) 
 Put yourselves in my position. 
 (Laughter) 
 I flew on Air Force Two for eight years. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now I have to take off my shoesnor boots to get on an airplane! 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 I'll tell you one quick story,to illustrate whatnthat's been like for me. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's a true story --nevery bit of this is true. 
 Soon after Tipper and I left the --n(Mock sob) White House -- 
 (Laughter) 
 we were driving from our homenin Nashville to a little farm we have,50 miles east of Nashville.,Driving ourselves. 
 (Laughter) 
 I know it sounds likena little thing to you, but -- 
 (Laughter) 
 I looked in the rear-view mirror,and all of a sudden it just hit me.,There was no motorcade back there. 
 (Laughter) 
 You've heard of phantom limb pain? 
 (Laughter) 
 This was a rented Ford Taurus. 
 (Laughter) 
 It was dinnertime,,and we started looking for a place to eat.,We were on I-40.,We got to Exit 238, Lebanon, Tennessee.,We got off the exit,nwe found a Shoney's restaurant.,Low-cost family restaurant chain,nfor those of you who don't know it.,We went in and sat down at the booth,nand the waitress came over,,made a big commotion over Tipper. 
 (Laughter) 
 She took our order, and then wentnto the couple in the booth next to us,,and she lowered her voice so much,,I had to really strain to hearnwhat she was saying.,And she said "Yes, that's formernVice President Al Gore,and his wife, Tipper.",And the man said,,"He's come down a long way, hasn't he?" 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 There's been kindnof a series of epiphanies. 
 (Laughter) 
 The very next day,ncontinuing the totally true story,,I got on a G-V to fly to Africanto make a speech in Nigeria,,in the city of Lagos,non the topic of energy.,And I began the speechnby telling them the story,of what had just happenednthe day before in Nashville.,And I told it pretty much the same waynI've just shared it with you:,Tipper and I were driving ourselves,,Shoney's, low-costnfamily restaurant chain,,what the man said -- they laughed.,I gave my speech, then went backnout to the airport to fly back home.,I fell asleep on the plane,until, during the middlenof the night, we landed,on the Azores Islands for refueling.,I woke up, they opened the door,nI went out to get some fresh air,,and I looked, and there was a mannrunning across the runway.,And he was waving a piecenof paper, and he was yelling,,"Call Washington! Call Washington!",And I thought to myself,nin the middle of the night,,in the middle of the Atlantic,,what in the world could benwrong in Washington?,Then I rememberednit could be a bunch of things. 
 (Laughter) 
 But what it turned out to be,,was that my staff was extremely upset,because one of the wire servicesnin Nigeria had already written a story,about my speech,,and it had already been printed in cities,all across the United States of America.,It was printed in Monterey, I checked. 
 (Laughter) 
 And the story began,,"Former Vice President Al Gorenannounced in Nigeria yesterday," quote:,'My wife Tipper and I have openedna low-cost family restaurant'" -- 
 (Laughter) 
 "'named Shoney's,,and we are running it ourselves.'" 
 (Laughter) 
 Before I could get back to U.S. soil,,David Letterman and Jay Lenonhad already started in on --,one of them had menin a big white chef's hat,,Tipper was saying,n"One more burger with fries!" 
 (Laughter) 
 Three days later,,I got a nice, long, handwritten letter,from my friend and partnernand colleague Bill Clinton, saying,,"Congratulationsnon the new restaurant, Al!" 
 (Laughter) 
 We like to celebrateneach other's successes in life. 
 (Laughter) 
 I was going to talknabout information ecology.,But I was thinking that,,since I plan to make a lifelong habitnof coming back to TED,,that maybe I could talknabout that another time. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: It's a deal! 
 (Applause) 
 Al Gore: I want to focusnon what many of you have said,you would like me to elaborate on:,What can you do about the climate crisis?,I want to start with a couple of --,I'm going to show some new images,,and I'm going to recapitulatenjust four or five.,Now, the slide show.,I update the slide shownevery time I give it.,I add new images,,because I learn more about itnevery time I give it.,It's like beach-combing, you know?,Every time the tide comes in and out,nyou find some more shells.,Just in the last two days, we gotnthe new temperature records in January.,This is just fornthe United States of America.,Historical averagenfor Januarys is 31 degrees;,last month was 39.5 degrees. 
 Now, I know that you wanted some morenbad news about the environment --,I'm kidding.,But these are the recapitulation slides,,and then I'm going to go into newnmaterial about what you can do.,But I wanted to elaboratenon a couple of these.,First of all, this is wherenwe're projected to go,with the U.S. contributionnto global warming,,under business as usual.,Efficiency in end-use electricitynand end-use of all energy,is the low-hanging fruit.,Efficiency and conservation --nit's not a cost; it's a profit.,The sign is wrong.,It's not negative; it's positive.,These are investmentsnthat pay for themselves.,But they are also very effectivenin deflecting our path. 
 Cars and trucks -- I talkednabout that in the slideshow,,but I want you to put it in perspective.,It's an easy, visible target of concern --,and it should be --,but there is more global warming pollutionnthat comes from buildings,than from cars and trucks.,Cars and trucks are very significant,,and we have the lowestnstandards in the world.,And so we should address that.nBut it's part of the puzzle.,Other transportation efficiencynis as important as cars and trucks.,Renewables at the current levelsnof technological efficiency,can make this much difference.,And with what Vinod, and John Doerrnand others, many of you here --,there are a lot of peoplendirectly involved in this --,this wedge is going to grownmuch more rapidly,than the current projection shows it.,Carbon Capture and Sequestration --nthat's what CCS stands for --,is likely to become the killer appnthat will enable us,to continue to use fossil fuelsnin a way that is safe.,Not quite there yet.,OK. Now, what can you do? 
 Reduce emissions in your home.,Most of these expendituresnare also profitable.,Insulation, better design.,Buy green electricity where you can.,I mentioned automobiles -- buy a hybrid.,Use light rail.,Figure out some of the other optionsnthat are much better.,It's important. 
 Be a green consumer.,You have choices with everything you buy,,between things that have a harsh effect,,or a much less harsh effectnon the global climate crisis.,Consider this:,Make a decision to livena carbon-neutral life.,Those of you who are good at branding,,I'd love to get your advice and help,on how to say this in a waynthat connects with the most people.,It is easier than you think.,It really is.,A lot of us in herenhave made that decision,,and it is really pretty easy.,It means reducenyour carbon dioxide emissions,with the full rangenof choices that you make,,and then purchase or acquire offsets,for the remainder that you have notncompletely reduced.,And what it means is elaboratednat climatecrisis.net. 
 There is a carbon calculator.,Participant Productions convened --,with my active involvement --,the leading software writers in the world,,on this arcane sciencenof carbon calculation,,to construct a consumer-friendlyncarbon calculator.,You can very precisely calculatenwhat your CO2 emissions are,,and then you will be givennoptions to reduce.,And by the time the moviencomes out in May,,this will be updated to 2.0,,and we will have click-throughnpurchases of offsets. 
 Next, consider makingnyour business carbon-neutral.,Again, some of us have done that,,and it's not as hard as you think.,Integrate climate solutionsninto all of your innovations,,whether you are from the technology,,or entertainment, or designnand architecture community.,Invest sustainably.,Majora mentioned this.,Listen, if you have invested moneynwith managers who you compensate,on the basis of their annual performance,,don't ever again complainnabout quarterly report CEO management.,Over time, people donwhat you pay them to do.,And if they judge how muchnthey're going to get paid,on your capital that they've invested,,based on the short-term returns,,you're going to get short-term decisions.,A lot more to be said about that. 
 Become a catalyst of change.,Teach others, learn about it,ntalk about it.,The movie is a movie versionnof the slideshow,I gave two nights ago,nexcept it's a lot more entertaining.,And it comes out in May.,Many of you here have the opportunitynto ensure that a lot of people see it.,Consider sending somebody to Nashville.,Pick well.,And I am personally going to train peoplento give this slideshow --,re-purposed, with somenof the personal stories obviously replaced,with a generic approach,,and it's not just the slides,nit's what they mean.,And it's how they link together.,And so I'm going to be conductingna course this summer,for a group of people that arennominated by different folks,to come and then give it en masse,,in communities all across the country,,and we're going to update the slideshownfor all of them every single week,,to keep it right on the cutting edge.,Working with Larry Lessig, it will be,nsomewhere in that process,,posted with toolsnand limited-use copyrights,,so that young people can remix itnand do it in their own way. 
 (Applause) 
 Where did anybody get the idea,that you ought to staynarm's length from politics?,It doesn't meannthat if you're a Republican,,that I'm trying to convince younto be a Democrat.,We need Republicans as well.,This used to be a bipartisan issue,,and I know thatnin this group it really is.,Become politically active.,Make our democracy work the waynit's supposed to work.,Support the idea of cappingncarbon dioxide emissions --,global warming pollution --nand trading it.,Here's why: as long as the United Statesnis out of the world system,,it's not a closed system.,Once it becomes a closed system,nwith U.S. participation,,then everybodynwho's on a board of directors --,how many people herenserve on the board of directors,of a corporation?,Once it's a closed system,,you will have legal liabilitynif you do not urge your CEO,to get the maximum income from reducingnand trading the carbon emissions,that can be avoided.,The market will worknto solve this problem --,if we can accomplish this.,Help with the mass persuasion campaignnthat will start this spring.,We have to change the mindsnof the American people.,Because presently, the politiciansndo not have permission,to do what needs to be done. 
 And in our modern country, the rolenof logic and reason no longer includes,mediating between wealth and powernthe way it once did.,It's now repetition of short, hot-button,n30-second, 28-second television ads.,We have to buy a lot of those ads.,Let's re-brand global warming,nas many of you have suggested.,I like "climate crisis"ninstead of "climate collapse,",but again, those of younwho are good at branding,,I need your help on this.,Somebody said the testnwe're facing now, a scientist told me,,is whether the combinationnof an opposable thumb,and a neocortex is a viable combination. 
 (Laughter) 
 That's really true. 
 I said the other night,nand I'll repeat now:,this is not a political issue.,Again, the Republicans here --nthis shouldn't be partisan.,You have more influencenthan some of us who are Democrats do.,This is an opportunity.,Not just this, but connectednto the ideas that are here,,to bring more coherence to them.,We are one. 
 Thank you very much, I appreciate it. 
 (Applause)Good morning. How are you? 
 (Laughter) 
 It's been great, hasn't it?,I've been blown away by the whole thing.,In fact, I'm leaving. 
 (Laughter) 
 There have been three themesnrunning through the conference,which are relevantnto what I want to talk about.,One is the extraordinarynevidence of human creativity,in all of the presentations that we've had,and in all of the people here.,Just the variety of itnand the range of it.,The second isnthat it's put us in a place,where we have no ideanwhat's going to happen,,in terms of the future.,No idea how this may play out. 
 I have an interest in education.,Actually, what I find is everybodynhas an interest in education.,Don't you?,I find this very interesting.,If you're at a dinner party,,and you say you work in education --,Actually, you're not oftennat dinner parties, frankly. 
 (Laughter) 
 If you work in education,nyou're not asked. 
 (Laughter) 
 And you're never asked back, curiously.nThat's strange to me.,But if you are, and you say to somebody,,you know, they say, "What do you do?",and you say you work in education,,you can see the blood run from their face.,They're like, "Oh my God,"nyou know, "Why me?" 
 (Laughter) 
 "My one night out all week." 
 (Laughter) 
 But if you ask about their education,nthey pin you to the wall.,Because it's one of those thingsnthat goes deep with people, am I right?,Like religion, and money and other things.,So I have a big interest in education,nand I think we all do.,We have a huge vested interest in it,,partly because it's educationnthat's meant to take us into this future,that we can't grasp.,If you think of it,nchildren starting school this year,will be retiring in 2065.,Nobody has a clue,,despite all the expertise that's beennon parade for the past four days,,what the world will look likenin five years' time.,And yet we're meantnto be educating them for it.,So the unpredictability,nI think, is extraordinary. 
 And the third part of this,is that we've all agreed, nonetheless,,on the really extraordinaryncapacities that children have --,their capacities for innovation.,I mean, Sirena last nightnwas a marvel, wasn't she?,Just seeing what she could do.,And she's exceptional, but I thinknshe's not, so to speak,,exceptional in the whole of childhood.,What you have there is a personnof extraordinary dedication,who found a talent.,And my contention is,nall kids have tremendous talents.,And we squander them, pretty ruthlessly. 
 So I want to talk about education,and I want to talk about creativity.,My contention is that creativity nownis as important in education as literacy,,and we should treat itnwith the same status. 
 (Applause) Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 That was it, by the way.,Thank you very much. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, 15 minutes left. 
 (Laughter) 
 Well, I was born... no. 
 (Laughter) 
 I heard a great story recentlyn-- I love telling it --,of a little girlnwho was in a drawing lesson.,She was six, and she wasnat the back, drawing,,and the teacher said this girlnhardly ever paid attention,,and in this drawing lesson, she did.,The teacher was fascinated.,She went over to her,nand she said, "What are you drawing?",And the girl said, "I'mndrawing a picture of God.",And the teacher said, "But nobodynknows what God looks like.",And the girl said,n"They will, in a minute." 
 (Laughter) 
 When my son was four in England --,Actually, he was fourneverywhere, to be honest. 
 (Laughter) 
 If we're being strict about it,nwherever he went, he was four that year.,He was in the Nativity play.nDo you remember the story? 
 (Laughter) 
 No, it was big, it was a big story.,Mel Gibson did the sequel,nyou may have seen it. 
 (Laughter) 
 "Nativity II.",But James got the part of Joseph,nwhich we were thrilled about.,We considered this to benone of the lead parts.,We had the place crammednfull of agents in T-shirts:,"James Robinson IS Joseph!" (Laughter),He didn't have to speak,,but you know the bitnwhere the three kings come in?,They come in bearing gifts,ngold, frankincense and myrrh.,This really happened.,We were sitting there and I thinknthey just went out of sequence,,because we talked to the little boynafterward and we said,,"You OK with that?" And he said,n"Yeah, why? Was that wrong?",They just switched.,The three boys came in,,four-year-olds with tea towelsnon their heads,,and they put these boxes down,,and the first boy said,n"I bring you gold.",And the second boy said,n"I bring you myrrh.",And the third boy said, "Frank sent this." 
 (Laughter) 
 What these things have in commonnis that kids will take a chance.,If they don't know, they'll have a go.,Am I right? They're notnfrightened of being wrong.,I don't mean to say that being wrongnis the same thing as being creative.,What we do know is,nif you're not prepared to be wrong,,you'll never come upnwith anything original --,if you're not prepared to be wrong.,And by the time they get to be adults,nmost kids have lost that capacity.,They have becomenfrightened of being wrong.,And we run our companies like this.,We stigmatize mistakes.,And we're now runningnnational education systems,where mistakes are the worstnthing you can make.,And the result is thatnwe are educating people,out of their creative capacities. 
 Picasso once said this, he saidnthat all children are born artists.,The problem is to remain an artistnas we grow up.,I believe this passionately,nthat we don't grow into creativity,,we grow out of it.,Or rather, we get educated out of it.,So why is this? 
 I lived in Stratford-on-Avonnuntil about five years ago.,In fact, we movednfrom Stratford to Los Angeles.,So you can imaginenwhat a seamless transition that was. 
 (Laughter) 
 Actually, we lived in a placencalled Snitterfield,,just outside Stratford,,which is wherenShakespeare's father was born.,Are you struck by a new thought? I was.,You don't think of Shakespearenhaving a father, do you?,Do you? Because you don't thinknof Shakespeare being a child, do you?,Shakespeare being seven?,I never thought of it.,I mean, he was seven at some point.,He was in somebody'snEnglish class, wasn't he? 
 (Laughter) 
 How annoying would that be? 
 (Laughter) 
 "Must try harder." 
 (Laughter) 
 Being sent to bed by his dad, you know,nto Shakespeare, "Go to bed, now!,And put the pencil down." 
 (Laughter) 
 "And stop speaking like that." 
 (Laughter) 
 "It's confusing everybody." 
 (Laughter) 
 Anyway, we movednfrom Stratford to Los Angeles,,and I just want to say a wordnabout the transition.,My son didn't want to come.,I've got two kids;nhe's 21 now, my daughter's 16.,He didn't want to come to Los Angeles.,He loved it, but he hadna girlfriend in England.,This was the love of his life, Sarah.,He'd known her for a month. 
 (Laughter) 
 Mind you, they'd hadntheir fourth anniversary,,because it's a long time when you're 16.,He was really upset on the plane,,he said, "I'll never findnanother girl like Sarah.",And we were rather pleasednabout that, frankly -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Because she was the main reasonnwe were leaving the country. 
 (Laughter) 
 But something strikes younwhen you move to America,and travel around the world:,Every education system on Earthnhas the same hierarchy of subjects.,Every one. Doesn't matter where you go.,You'd think it would benotherwise, but it isn't.,At the top are mathematics and languages,,then the humanities,nand at the bottom are the arts.,Everywhere on Earth.,And in pretty much every system too,nthere's a hierarchy within the arts.,Art and music are normallyngiven a higher status in schools,than drama and dance.,There isn't an educationnsystem on the planet,that teaches dance everyday to children,the way we teach them mathematics. Why?,Why not? I think this is rather important.,I think math is verynimportant, but so is dance.,Children dance all the timenif they're allowed to, we all do.,We all have bodies, don't we?nDid I miss a meeting? 
 (Laughter) 
 Truthfully, what happens is,nas children grow up,,we start to educate them progressivelynfrom the waist up.,And then we focus on their heads.,And slightly to one side. 
 If you were to visitneducation, as an alien,,and say "What's it for, public education?",I think you'd have to conclude,nif you look at the output,,who really succeeds by this,,who does everything that they should,,who gets all the brownienpoints, who are the winners --,I think you'd have to concludenthe whole purpose of public education,throughout the world,is to produce university professors.,Isn't it?,They're the people who come out the top.,And I used to be one, so there. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I like universitynprofessors, but you know,,we shouldn't hold them up,as the high-water marknof all human achievement.,They're just a form of life,,another form of life.,But they're rather curious, and I say thisnout of affection for them.,There's something curiousnabout professors in my experience --,not all of them, but typically,nthey live in their heads.,They live up there,nand slightly to one side.,They're disembodied, you know,nin a kind of literal way.,They look upon their body as a formnof transport for their heads. 
 (Laughter) 
 Don't they?,It's a way of gettingntheir head to meetings. 
 (Laughter) 
 If you want real evidencenof out-of-body experiences,,get yourself along to a residentialnconference of senior academics,,and pop into the discothequenon the final night. 
 (Laughter) 
 And there, you will see it.,Grown men and womennwrithing uncontrollably, off the beat. 
 (Laughter) 
 Waiting until it ends so they canngo home and write a paper about it. 
 (Laughter) 
 Our education system is predicatednon the idea of academic ability.,And there's a reason.,Around the world, there werenno public systems of education,,really, before the 19th century.,They all came into beingnto meet the needs of industrialism.,So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas. 
 Number one, that the most usefulnsubjects for work are at the top.,So you werenprobably steered benignly away,from things at school when younwere a kid, things you liked,,on the grounds that you wouldnnever get a job doing that. Is that right?,Don't do music, you're notngoing to be a musician;,don't do art, you won't be an artist.,Benign advice -- now, profoundly mistaken.,The whole worldnis engulfed in a revolution. 
 And the second is academic ability,,which has really come to dominatenour view of intelligence,,because the universities designednthe system in their image.,If you think of it, the whole systemnof public education around the world,is a protracted processnof university entrance.,And the consequencenis that many highly-talented,,brilliant, creativenpeople think they're not,,because the thingnthey were good at at school,wasn't valued,nor was actually stigmatized.,And I think we can't affordnto go on that way. 
 In the next 30 years, according to UNESCO,,more people worldwide will be graduating,through educationnthan since the beginning of history.,More people, and it's the combinationnof all the things we've talked about --,technology and its transformationneffect on work, and demography,and the huge explosion in population. 
 Suddenly, degrees aren't worth anything.,Isn't that true?,When I was a student,nif you had a degree, you had a job.,If you didn't have a job,nit's because you didn't want one.,And I didn't want one, frankly. (Laughter),But now kids with degrees,are often heading homento carry on playing video games,,because you need an MA wherenthe previous job required a BA,,and now you need a PhD for the other.,It's a process of academic inflation.,And it indicates the wholenstructure of education,is shifting beneath our feet.,We need to radically rethinknour view of intelligence. 
 We know three things about intelligence.,One, it's diverse.,We think about the world in all the waysnthat we experience it.,We think visually, we think in sound,nwe think kinesthetically.,We think in abstract terms,nwe think in movement.,Secondly, intelligence is dynamic.,If you look at the interactionsnof a human brain,,as we heard yesterdaynfrom a number of presentations,,intelligence is wonderfully interactive.,The brain isn't divided into compartments.,In fact, creativity --nwhich I define as the process,of having original ideasnthat have value --,more often than not comes aboutnthrough the interaction,of different disciplinarynways of seeing things. 
 By the way, there's a shaft of nervesnthat joins the two halves of the brain,called the corpus callosum.,It's thicker in women.,Following off from Helen yesterday,,this is probably why womennare better at multi-tasking.,Because you are, aren't you?,There's a raft of research,nbut I know it from my personal life.,If my wife is cooking a meal at home --nwhich is not often, thankfully. 
 (Laughter) 
 No, she's good at some things,nbut if she's cooking,,she's dealing with people on the phone,,she's talking to the kids,nshe's painting the ceiling,,she's doing open-heart surgery over here.,If I'm cooking, the doornis shut, the kids are out,,the phone's on the hook,nif she comes in I get annoyed.,I say, "Terry, please,nI'm trying to fry an egg in here." 
 (Laughter) 
 "Give me a break." 
 (Laughter) 
 Actually, do you knownthat old philosophical thing,,if a tree falls in a forestnand nobody hears it, did it happen?,Remember that old chestnut?,I saw a great t-shirtnrecently, which said,,"If a man speaks his mindnin a forest, and no woman hears him,,is he still wrong?" 
 (Laughter) 
 And the third thing about intelligence is,,it's distinct.,I'm doing a new book at the momentncalled "Epiphany,",which is based on a seriesnof interviews with people,about how they discovered their talent.,I'm fascinatednby how people got to be there.,It's really prompted by a conversationnI had with a wonderful woman,who maybe most peoplenhave never heard of, Gillian Lynne.,Have you heard of her? Some have.,She's a choreographer,nand everybody knows her work.,She did "Cats" and "Phantom of the Opera.",She's wonderful.,I used to be on the boardnof The Royal Ballet,,as you can see.,Anyway, Gillian and I hadnlunch one day and I said,,"How did you get to be a dancer?",It was interesting.,When she was at school,nshe was really hopeless.,And the school, in the '30s,nwrote to her parents and said,,"We think Gilliannhas a learning disorder.",She couldn't concentrate;nshe was fidgeting.,I think now they'd say she had ADHD.nWouldn't you?,But this was the 1930s, and ADHDnhadn't been invented at this point.,It wasn't an available condition. 
 (Laughter) 
 People weren't aware they could have that. 
 (Laughter) 
 Anyway, she went to see this specialist.,So, this oak-paneled room,nand she was there with her mother,,and she was led and satnon this chair at the end,,and she sat on her hands for 20 minutesnwhile this man talked to her mother,about the problemsnGillian was having at school.,Because she was disturbing people;nher homework was always late; and so on,,little kid of eight.,In the end, the doctornwent and sat next to Gillian, and said,,"I've listened to all thesenthings your mother's told me,,I need to speak to her privately.,Wait here. We'll be back;nwe won't be very long,",and they went and left her. 
 But as they went out of the room,,he turned on the radionthat was sitting on his desk.,And when they got out, he said to hernmother, "Just stand and watch her.",And the minute they left the room,,she was on her feet, moving to the music.,And they watched for a few minutesnand he turned to her mother and said,,"Mrs. Lynne, Gilliannisn't sick; she's a dancer.,Take her to a dance school." 
 I said, "What happened?",She said, "She did. I can't tell younhow wonderful it was.,We walked in this roomnand it was full of people like me.,People who couldn't sit still.,People who had to move to think."nWho had to move to think.,They did ballet, they did tap, jazz;nthey did modern; they did contemporary.,She was eventually auditionednfor the Royal Ballet School;,she became a soloist; she hadna wonderful career at the Royal Ballet.,She eventually graduatednfrom the Royal Ballet School,,founded the Gillian Lynne Dance Company,,met Andrew Lloyd Webber.,She's been responsible for,some of the most successfulnmusical theater productions in history,,she's given pleasure to millions,nand she's a multi-millionaire.,Somebody else might have put hernon medication and told her to calm down. 
 (Applause) 
 What I think it comes to is this:,Al Gore spoke the other night,about ecology and the revolutionnthat was triggered by Rachel Carson.,I believe our only hope for the future,is to adopt a new conceptionnof human ecology,,one in which we startnto reconstitute our conception,of the richness of human capacity.,Our education system has mined our minds,in the way that we strip-mine the earth:nfor a particular commodity.,And for the future, it won't serve us.,We have to rethinknthe fundamental principles,on which we're educating our children. 
 There was a wonderful quotenby Jonas Salk, who said,,"If all the insectsnwere to disappear from the Earth,,within 50 years all lifenon Earth would end.,If all human beingsndisappeared from the Earth,,within 50 years all formsnof life would flourish.",And he's right. 
 What TED celebrates is the giftnof the human imagination.,We have to be careful now,that we use this gift wisely,and that we avert some of the scenariosnthat we've talked about.,And the only way we'll do it is by seeingnour creative capacities,for the richness they are,and seeing our childrennfor the hope that they are.,And our task is to educatentheir whole being,,so they can face this future.,By the way -- we may not see this future,,but they will.,And our job is to help themnmake something of it. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I'm often asked,,"What surprised you about the book?",And I say, "That I got to write it.",I would have never imagined that.,Not in my wildest dreams did I think --,I don't even considernmyself to be an author.,And I'm often asked,,"Why do you think so manynpeople have read this?,This thing's selling stillnabout a million copies a month." 
 And I think it's becausenspiritual emptiness,is a universal disease.,I think inside at some point, we putnour heads down on the pillow and we go,,"There's got to be morento life than this.",Get up in the morning, go to work,ncome home and watch TV,,go to bed, get up in the morning, gonto work, come home, watch TV, go to bed,,go to parties on weekends.,A lot of people say, "I'm living." No,nyou're not living -- that's just existing.,Just existing.,I really think thatnthere's this inner desire.,I do believe what Chris said;nI believe that you're not an accident.,Your parents may not have planned you,nbut I believe God did.,I think there are accidental parents;nthere's no doubt about that.,I don't think there are accidental kids.,And I think you matter. 
 I think you matter to God;nI think you matter to history;,I think you matter to this universe.,And I think that the difference,between what I call the survival levelnof living, the success level of living,,and the significance level of living is:,Do you figure out,n"What on Earth am I here for?",I meet a lot of people who are very smart,,and say, "But why can't Infigure out my problems?",And I meet a lot of peoplenwho are very successful,,who say, "Why don't I feel more fulfilled?,Why do I feel like a fake?,Why do I feel like I've got to pretendnthat I'm more than I really am?",I think that comes down to this issuenof meaning, of significance, of purpose.,I think it comes down to this issue of:,"Why am I here? What am I here for?nWhere am I going?",These are not religious issues.,They're human issues. 
 I wanted to tell Michael before he spokenthat I really appreciate what he does,,because it makes my life workna whole lot easier.,As a pastor, I do see a lot of kooks.,And I have learned that there arenkooks in every area of life.,Religion doesn't have a monopoly on that,,but there are plenty of religious kooks.,There are secular kooks;nthere are smart kooks, dumb kooks.,There are people -- a ladyncame up to me the other day,,and she had a white piece of paper --nMichael, you'll like this one --,and she said, "What do you see in it?",And I looked at it and I said,n"Oh, I don't see anything.",And she goes, "Well, I see Jesus,"nand started crying and left.,I'm going, "OK," you know? "Fine." 
 (Laughter) 
 Good for you. 
 When the book became the best-selling booknin the world for the last three years,,I kind of had my little crisis.,And that was: What is the purpose of this?,Because it brought innenormous amounts of money.,When you write the best-sellingnbook in the world,,it's tons and tons of money.,And it brought in a lot of attention,nneither of which I wanted.,When I started Saddleback Church,nI was 25 years old.,I started it withnone other family in 1980.,And I decided that I was neverngoing to go on TV,,because I didn't want to be a celebrity.,I didn't want to be a, quote,n"evangelist, televangelist" --,that's not my thing.,And all of the sudden, it brought a lotnof money and a lot of attention.,I don't think --,now, this is a worldview,,and I will tell you,neverybody's got a worldview. 
 Everybody's bettingntheir life on something.,You're betting your life on something,,you just better know whynyou're betting what you're betting on.,So, everybody's bettingntheir life on something.,And when I, you know, made a bet,,I happened to believenthat Jesus was who he said he was.,And I believe in a pluralistic society,,everybody's betting on something.,And when I started the church,,you know, I had no plansnto do what it's doing now.,And then when I wrote this book,,and all of a sudden, it just took off,,and I started saying, now,nwhat's the purpose of this?,Because as I started to say,,I don't think you're given money or fame,for your own ego, ever.,I just don't believe that.,And when you write a booknthat the first sentence of the book is,,"It's not about you,",then, when all of a sudden it becomesnthe best-selling book in history,,you've got to figure, well,nI guess it's not about me.,That's kind of a no-brainer.,So, what is it for? 
 And I began to think about what I callnthe "stewardship of affluence",and the "stewardship of influence.",So I believe, essentially,nleadership is stewardship.,That if you are a leader in any area --,in business, in politics,nin sports, in art,,in academics, in any area --,you don't own it.,You are a steward of it.,For instance, that's why I believenin protecting the environment.,This is not my planet.,It wasn't mine before I was born,nit's not going to be mine after I die,,I'm just here for 80 yearsnand then that's it. 
 I was debatingnthe other day on a talk show,,and the guy was challengingnme and he'd go,,"What's a pastor doingnon protecting the environment?",And I asked this guy, I said,n"Well, do you believe,that human beings are responsible,to make the world a little bit betternplace for the next generation?,Do you think we have a stewardship here,nto take the environment seriously?",And he said, "No.",I said, "Oh, you don't?",I said, "Let me make this clear again:,Do you believe that as human beings --nI'm not talking about religion --,do you believe that as human beings,nit is our responsibility,to take care of this planet,,and make it just a little bit betternfor the next generation?",And he said, "No. Not any morenthan any other species.",When he said the word "species,"nhe was revealing his worldview.,And he was saying,,"I'm no more responsible to take carenof this environment than a duck is.",Well now, I know a lotnof times we act like ducks,,but you're not a duck.,You're not a duck.,And you are responsible --nthat's my worldview.,And so, you need to understandnwhat your worldview is. 
 The problem is most peoplennever really think it through.,They never really ...,codify it or qualify it or quantify it,,and say, "This is what I believe in.nThis is why I believe what I believe.",I don't personally havenenough faith to be an atheist.,But you may, you may.,Your worldview, though, does determineneverything else in your life,,because it determines your decisions;,it determines your relationships;,it determines your level of confidence.,It determines, really,neverything in your life.,What we believe, obviously --,and you know this --ndetermines our behavior,,and our behavior determinesnwhat we become in life. 
 So all of this money started pouring in,,and all of this fame started pouring in.,And I'm going, what do I do with this?,My wife and I first made five decisionsnon what to do with the money.,We said, "First, we're notngoing to use it on ourselves.",I didn't go out and buy a bigger house.,I don't own a guesthouse.,I still drive the same four year-oldnFord that I've driven.,We just said, we're notngoing to use it on us.,The second thing was,,I stopped taking a salarynfrom the church that I pastor.,Third thing is, I added upnall that the church had paid me,over the last 25 years,nand I gave it back.,And I gave it back becausenI didn't want anybody thinking,that I do what I do for money -- I don't.,In fact, personally, I've never met,a priest or a pastor or a ministernwho does it for money.,I know that's the stereotype;nI've never met one of them.,Believe me, there's a whole lotneasier ways to make money. 
 Pastors are like on 24 hours-a-day call,nthey're like doctors.,I left late today -- I'd hopednto be here yesterday --,because my father-in-lawnis in his last, probably, 48 hours,before he dies of cancer.,And I'm watching a guynwho's lived his life --,he's now in his mid-80s --nand he's dying with peace.,You know, the test of your worldviewnis not how you act in the good times.,The test of your worldviewnis how you act at the funeral.,And having been through literallynhundreds if not thousands of funerals,,it makes a difference.,It makes a difference what you believe. 
 So, we gave it all back,,and then we set up three foundations,,working on some of the majornproblems of the world:,illiteracy, poverty, pandemic diseases --nparticularly HIV/AIDS --,and set up these three foundations,nand put the money into that.,The last thing we did is we becamenwhat I call "reverse tithers.",And that is, when my wifenand I got married 30 years ago,,we started tithing.,Now, that's a principle in the Bible,that says give 10 percentnof what you get back to charity,,give it away to help other people.,So, we started doing that, and each yearnwe would raise our tithe one percent.,So, our first year of marriagenwe went to 11 percent,,second year we went to 12 percent,,and the third year we went to 13 percent,,and on and on and on.,Why did I do that?,Because every time I give,,it breaks the gripnof materialism in my life. 
 Materialism is all about getting --nget, get, get, get all you can,,can all you get, sit on the cannand spoil the rest.,It's all about more, having more.,And we think that the good lifenis actually looking good --,that's most important of all --,looking good, feeling goodnand having the goods.,But that's not the good life.,I meet people all the time who haventhose, and they're not necessarily happy.,If money actually made you happy,,then the wealthiest peoplenin the world would be the happiest.,And that I know, personally,nI know, is not true.,It's just not true. 
 So, the good life is not about lookingngood, feeling good or having the goods,,it's about being good and doing good.,Giving your life away.,Significance in lifendoesn't come from status,,because you can always findnsomebody who's got more than you.,It doesn't come from sex.,It doesn't come from salary.,It comes from serving.,It is in giving our lives awaynthat we find meaning,,we find significance.,That's the way we were wired,nI believe, by God.,And so we began to give away,,and now after 30 years,,my wife and I are reverse tithers --nwe give away 90 percent and live on 10.,That, actually, was the easy part.,The hard part is, what do I donwith all this attention?,Because I started gettingnall kinds of invitations.,I just came off a nearlynmonth-long speaking tour,on three different continents,,and I won't go into that,,but it was an amazing thing.,And I'm going, what do I donwith this notoriety,that the book has brought? 
 And, being a pastor,nI started reading the Bible.,There's a chapter in the Biblencalled Psalm 72,,and it's Solomon's prayernfor more influence.,When you read this prayer,,it sounds incrediblynselfish, self-centered.,He says, "God, I want younto make me famous.",That's what he prays.,He said, "I want you to make me famous.,I want you to spread the famenof my name through every land,,I want you to give me power.,I want you to make me famous,nI want you to give me influence.",And it just sounds like the mostnegotistical request you could make,,if you were going to pray.,Until you read the whole psalm,nthe whole chapter.,And then he says,n"So that the king ..." --,he was the king of Israelnat that time, at its apex in power --,"... so that the king may carenfor the widow and orphan,,support the oppressed, defendnthe defenseless, care for the sick,,assist the poor,nspeak up for the foreigner,,those in prison.",Basically, he's talking aboutnall the marginalized in society. 
 And as I read that,,I looked at it, and I thought, you know,,what this is saying is that the purposenof influence is to speak up,for those who have no influence.,The purpose of influencenis not to build your ego.,Or your net worth.,And, by the way, your net worth is notnthe same thing as your self-worth.,Your value is not based on your valuables.,It's based on a wholendifferent set of things.,And so the purposenof influence is to speak up,for those who have no influence.,And I had to admit:,I can't think of the last timenI thought of widows and orphans.,They're not on my radar.,I pastor a church in one of the mostnaffluent areas of America --,a bunch of gated communities.,I have a church fullnof CEOs and scientists.,And I could go five years and never,never see a homeless person.,They're just not in my pathway.,Now, they're 13 milesnup the road in Santa Ana.,So I had to say, ok,,I would use whatever affluencenand whatever influence I've got,to help those who don't haveneither of those. 
 You know, there's a storynin the Bible about Moses,,whether you believe it's true or not,nit really doesn't matter to me.,But Moses, if you saw the movie,n"The Ten Commandments,",Moses goes out, and there's thisnburning bush, and God talks to him,,and God says,n"Moses, what's in your hand?",I think that's one of the most importantnquestions you'll ever be asked:,What's in your hand?,Moses says, "It's a staff.nIt's a shepherd's staff.",And God says, "Throw it down.",And if you saw the movie, you know,nhe throws it down and it becomes a snake.,And then God says, "Pick it up.",And he picks it back up again,,and it becomes a staff again.,Now, I'm reading this thing,nand I'm going, what is that all about?,OK. What's that all about? Well,nI do know a couple of things.,Number one, God never doesna miracle to show off.,It's not just, "Wow, isn't that cool?",And, by the way, my God doesn'tnhave to show up on cheese bread.,You know, if God's going to show up,nhe's not going to show up on cheese bread. 
 (Laughter) 
 Ok? I just, this is why I lovenwhat Michael does,,because it's like, if he's debunking it,nthen I don't have to.,But God -- my God --ndoesn't show up on sprinkler images.,He's got a few more powerful waysnthan that to do whatever he wants to do.,But he doesn't do miraclesnjust to show off. 
 Second thing is,nif God ever asks you a question,,he already knows the answer.,Obviously, if he's God,nthen that would mean,that when he asks the question,nit's for your benefit, not his.,So he's going, "What's in your hand?",Now, what was in Moses' hand?,Well, it was a shepherd's staff.nNow, follow me on this. 
 This staff representednthree things about Moses' life.,First, it represented his identity;nhe was a shepherd.,It's the symbol of his own occupation:,I am a shepherd.,It's a symbol of his identity,nhis career, his job.,Second, it's a symbolnof not only his identity,,it's a symbol of his income, because allnof his assets are tied up in sheep.,In those days, nobody had bank accounts,nor American Express cards, or hedge funds.,Your assets are tied up in your flocks.,So it's a symbol of his identity,nand it's a symbol of his income.,And the third thing:nit's a symbol of his influence.,What do you do with a shepherd's staff?,Well, you know, you move sheepnfrom point A to point B with it,,by hook or by crook.,You pull them or you poke them.nOne or the other.,So, he's saying,,"You're going to lay down your identity.,What's in your hand?,You've got identity, you've got income,nyou've got influence.,What's in your hand?",And he's saying, "If you lay it down,nI'll make it come alive.,I'll do some thingsnyou could never imagine possible.",And if you've watched that movie,n"Ten Commandments,",all of those big miracles that happennin Egypt are done through this staff. 
 Last year, I was invited to speaknat the NBA All-Stars game.,And so, I'm talking to the players,,because most of the NBA teams,nNFL teams and all the other teams,have done this 40 Days of Purpose,nbased on the book.,And I asked them, I said,n"What's in your hand?,So, what's in your hand?"nI said, "It's a basketball.,And that basketball representsnyour identity, who you are:,you're an NBA player.,It represents your income:,you're making a lot of moneynoff that little ball.,And it represents your influence.,And even though you're only goingnto be in the NBA for a few years,,you're going to be an NBA playernfor the rest of your life.,And that gives you enormous influence.,So, what are you going to donwith what you've been given?" 
 And I guess that's the main reasonnI came up here today,,to all of you very bright people at TED --,it is to say, "What's in your hand?",What do you have that you've been given?,Talent, background, education,,freedom, networks, opportunities,,wealth, ideas, creativity.,What are you doingnwith what you've been given?,That, to me, is the primarynquestion about life.,That, to me, is what beingnpurpose-driven is all about.,In the book, I talk aboutnhow you're wired to do certain things,,you're "SHAPED" with -- a little acrostic:nSpiritual gifts, Heart,,Ability, Personality and Experiences.,These things shape you.,And if you want to know what you oughtnto be doing with your life,,you need to look at your shape --n"What am I wired to do?",Why would God wire you to do somethingnand then not have you do it?,If you're wired to be an anthropologist,nyou'll be an anthropologist.,If you're wired to benan undersea explorer,,you'll be an undersea explorer.,If you're wired to make deals,nyou make deals.,If you're wired to paint, you paint. 
 Did you know that God smilesnwhen you be you?,When my little kids --nwhen my kids were little --,they're all grown now, I have grandkids --,I used to go in and sitnon the side of their bed,,and I used to watch my kids sleep.,And I just watched their little bodiesnrise and lower, rise and lower.,And I would look at them:n"This is not an accident.",Rise and lower.,And I got joy out of justnwatching them sleep.,Some people have the misguided ideanthat God only gets excited,when you're doing, quote,n"spiritual things,",like going to church or helping the poor,,or, you know, confessingnor doing something like that.,The bottom line is, God gets pleasurenwatching you be you.,Why? He made you.,And when you do what you were made to do,,he goes, "That's my boy! That's my girl!,You're using the talentnand ability that I gave you." 
 So my advice to you is:,look at what's in your hand --,your identity, your influence,nyour income --,and say, "It's not about me.,It's about making the worldna better place." 
 Thank you.I'm going to take younon a journey very quickly.,To explain the wish, I'm goingnto have to take you somewhere,where many people haven't been,nand that's around the world.,When I was about 24 years old, Kate Stohrnand myself started an organization,to get architects and designersninvolved in humanitarian work,,not only about respondingnto natural disasters,,but involved in systemic issues.,We believe that where the resourcesnand expertise are scarce,,innovative, sustainable design can reallynmake a difference in people's lives. 
 So I started my life as an architect,nor training as an architect,,and I was always interestednin socially responsible design,,and how you can really make an impact.,But when I went to architecture school,,it seemed that I wasna black sheep in the family.,Many architects seemed to thinknthat when you design,,you design a jewel, and it's a jewelnthat you try and crave for;,whereas I felt that when you design,,you either improvenor you create a detriment,to the communitynin which you're designing.,So you're not just doingna building for the residents,or for the people who are going to use it,nbut for the community as a whole. 
 And in 1999, we started by respondingnto the issue of the housing crisis,for returning refugees in Kosovo.,And I didn't know what I was doing --nlike I said, mid-20s --,and I'm the Internet generation,nso we started a website.,We put a call out there,nand to my surprise, in a couple of months,,we had hundreds of entriesnfrom around the world.,That led to a numbernof prototypes being built,and really experimenting with some ideas.,Two years later we started doing a project,on developing mobile health clinicsnin sub-Saharan Africa,,responding to the HIV/AIDS pandemic.,That led to 550 entries from 53 countries.,We also have designersnfrom around the world that participate.,And we had an exhibitnof work that followed that.,2004 was the tipping point for us.,We started responding to natural disasters,and getting involved in Iran, in Bam,,also following up on our work in Africa. 
 Working within the United States --,most people look at povertynand they see the face of a foreigner.,But I live in Bozeman, Montana --,go up to the north plainsnon the reservations,,or go down to Alabamanor Mississippi, pre-Katrina,,and I could have shown younplaces that have far worse conditions,than many developing countriesnthat I've been to.,So we got involved in and workednin inner cities and elsewhere; 
 and also, I will go intonsome more projects.,2005: Mother Nature kicked our ass.,I think we can pretty much assumenthat 2005 was a horrific year,when it comes to natural disasters.,And because of the Internet,,and because of connectionsnto blogs and so forth,,within literally hours of the tsunami,nwe were already raising funds,,getting involved, workingnwith people on the ground.,We run from a couple of laptops,nand in the first couple of days,,I had 4,000 emailsnfrom people needing help.,So we began to get involvednin projects there,,and I'll talk about some others.,And then of course, this yearnwe've been responding to Katrina,,as well as following upnon our reconstruction work. 
 So this is a brief overview.,In 2004, I really couldn't managenthe number of people who wanted to help,,or the number of requestsnthat I was getting.,It was all comingninto my laptop and cell phone.,So we decided to embracenan open-source model of business --,so that anyone, anywhere in the world,ncould start a local chapter,,and they can get involvednin local problems.,Because I believe therenis no such thing as Utopia.,All problems are local.nAll solutions are local.,So that means, you know,nsomebody who's based in Mississippi,knows more about Mississippi than I do.,So what happened is, we used Meetupnand all these other Internet tools,,and we ended up havingn40 chapters starting up,,thousands of architects in 104 countries.,So the bullet point --nsorry, I never do a suit,,so I knew that I was goingnto take this off.,OK, because I'm going to do it very quick. 
 This isn't just about nonprofit.,What it showed me is thatnthere's a grassroots movement going on,,of socially responsible designersnwho really believe,that this world has got a lot smaller,nand that we have the opportunity --,not the responsibility,nbut the opportunity --,to really get involved in making change. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm adding that to my time. 
 (Laughter) 
 So what you don't know is,,we've got these thousands of designersnworking around the world,,connected basically by a website,nand we have a staff of three.,The fact that nobody told usnwe couldn't do it, we did it.,And so there's somethingnto be said about naïveté.,So seven years later, we've developed,so that we've got advocacy,ninstigation and implementation.,We advocate for good design,nnot only through student workshops,and lectures and public forums, op-eds;,we have a book on humanitarian work;,but also disaster mitigationnand dealing with public policy.,We can talk about FEMA,nbut that's another talk.,Instigation, developing ideasnwith communities and NGOs,,doing open-source design competitions.,Referring, matchmaking with communities.,And then implementing -- actuallyngoing out there and doing the work,,because when you invent,nit's never a reality until it's built.,So it's really importantnthat if we're designing,and trying to create change,nwe build that change. 
 So here's a select number of projects.,Kosovo.,This is Kosovo in '99.,We did an open designncompetition, like I said.,It led to a whole variety of ideas.,And this wasn't about emergency shelter,,but transitional shelternthat would last five to 10 years,,that would be placed next to the landnthe resident lived in,,and that they would rebuildntheir own home.,This wasn't imposingnan architecture on a community;,this was giving themnthe tools and the space,to allow them to rebuild and regrownthe way they want to.,We had from the sublimento the ridiculous, but they worked.,This is an inflatable hemp house.nIt was built; it works. 
 This is a shipping container.,Built and works.,And a whole variety of ideas,that not only dealt withnarchitectural building,,but also the issues of governance,,and the idea of creating communitiesnthrough complex networks. 
 So we've engaged not just designers,,but also a whole varietynof technology-based professionals.,Using rubble from destroyed homesnto create new homes.,Using straw bale construction,ncreating heat walls.,And then something remarkablenhappened in '99. 
 We went to Africa originallynto look at the housing issue.,Within three days, we realizednthe problem was not housing;,it was the growing pandemic of HIV/AIDS.,And it wasn't doctors telling us this;,it was actual villagersnthat we were staying with.,And so we came up with the bright idea,that instead of getting people to walkn10, 15 kilometers to see doctors,,you get the doctors to the people.,And we started engagingnthe medical community,,and you know, we thoughtnwe were real bright sparks --,"We've come up with this great idea:,mobile health clinics, widely distributednthroughout sub-Saharan Africa.",And the medical community there said,,"We've said this for the last decade.,We know this. We just don't knownhow to show this.",So in a way, we had taken pre-existingnneeds and shown solutions.,And so again, we had a whole varietynof ideas that came in. 
 This one I personally love,,because the idea is that architecturenis not just about solutions,,but about raising awareness.,This is a kenaf clinic.,You get seed and you grow itnin a plot of land,,and it grows 14 feet in a month.,And on the fourth week, the doctorsncome and they mow out an area,,put a tensile structure on the top,,and when the doctorsnhave finished treating,and seeing patients and villagers,,you cut down the clinic and you eat it.,It's an eat-your-own-clinic. 
 So it's dealing with the factnthat if you have AIDS,,you also need to have nutrition rates,,and the idea of nutrition is as important,as getting antiretrovirals out there.,So you know, this is a serious solution.,This one I love.,The idea is it's not just a clinic,nit's a community center.,This looked at setting up trade routes,and economic engines within the community,,so it can be a self-sustaining project. 
 Every one of these projectsnis sustainable.,That's not becausenI'm a tree-hugging green person.,It's because when you livenon four dollars a day,,you're living on survivalnand you have to be sustainable.,You have to know wherenyour energy is coming from,,you have to know wherenyour resource is coming from,,and you have to keep the maintenance down.,So this is about gettingnan economic engine,,and then at night,nit turns into a movie theater.,So it's not an AIDS clinic.nIt's a community center.,So you can see ideas.,And these ideas developed into prototypes,,and they were eventually built.,And currently, as of this year,,there are clinics rolling outnin Nigeria and Kenya. 
 From that, we also developed Siyathemba.,The community came to us and said,,"The problem is that the girlsndon't have education.",And we're working in an area,where young womennbetween the ages of 16 and 24,have a 50 percent HIV/AIDS rate.,And that's notnbecause they're promiscuous,,it's because there's no knowledge. 
 And so we decided to looknat the idea of sports,,and create a youth sports center,that doubled as an HIV/AIDSnoutreach center,,and the coaches of the girls' teamnwere also trained doctors.,So that there would be a very slow waynof developing confidence in health care.,And we picked nine finalists,,and then those nine finalists werendistributed throughout the entire region,,and then the communitynpicked their design.,They said, this is our design,,because it's not onlynabout engaging a community;,it's about empowering a community,,and about getting them to bena part of the rebuilding process. 
 So, the winning design is here.,And then, of course,nwe actually go and work,with the community and the clients. 
 So this is the designer.,He's out there workingnwith the first ever women's soccer team,in KwaZulu-Natal, Siyathemba.,And they can tell it better. 
 (A cappella singingnin a South African language) 
 Video: Well, my name is Cee Cee Mkhonza.,I work at the Africa Centre,nI'm an IT user consultant.,I'm also the national football playernfor South Africa, Banyana Banyana.,And I also play in the Vodacom League,nfor the team called Tembisa,,which has now changed to Siyathemba.,This is our home ground. 
 Cameron Sinclair: I'm going to show thatnlater because I'm running out of time.,I can see Chris looking at me slyly. 
 This was a connection,njust a meeting with somebody,who wanted to develop Africa's firstntelemedicine center, in Tanzania.,And we met, literally,na couple of months ago.,We've already developed a design.,The team is over there,nworking in partnership.,This was a matchmaking,nthanks to a couple of TEDsters --,Sun [Microsystems],nCheryl Heller and Andrew Zolli,,who connected menwith this amazing African woman.,And we start construction in June,nand it will be opened by TEDGlobal.,So when you come to TEDGlobal,nyou can check it out. 
 But what we're known probably most fornis dealing with disasters and development,,and we've been involvednin a lot of issues,,such as the tsunaminand also things like Hurricane Katrina.,This is a 370-dollar shelternthat can be easily assembled.,This is a community-designedncommunity center.,And what that means is we actuallynlive and work with the community,,and they're part of the design process.,The kids actually getninvolved in mapping out,where the community center should be.,And then eventually, the community,nthrough skills training,,end up building the building with us. 
 Here is another school.,This is what the UN gave these guysnfor six months -- 12 plastic tarps.,This was in August.,This was the replacement;nthat's supposed to last for two years.,When the rain comes down,nyou can't hear a thing,,and in the summer,nit's about 140 degrees inside.,So we said, if the rain's comingndown, let's get fresh water.,So every one of our schoolsnhas a rainwater collection system.,Very low cost: three classroomsnand rainwater collection is 5,000 dollars.,This was raised by hot chocolatensales in Atlanta.,It's built by the parents of the kids.,The kids are out there on-site,nbuilding the buildings.,And it opened a couple of weeks ago,,and there's 600 kidsnthat are now using the schools. 
 (Applause) 
 So, disaster hits home.,We see the bad storiesnon CNN and Fox and all that,,but we don't see the good stories.,Here is a community that got together,nand they said "no" to waiting.,They formed a partnership,na diverse partnership of players,,to actually map out East Biloxi,,to figure out who's getting involved.,We've had over 1,500 volunteersnrebuilding, rehabbing homes.,Figuring out what FEMA regulations are,,not waiting for them to dictatento us how you should rebuild.,Working with residents,,getting them out of their homes,nso they don't get ill.,This is what they'rencleaning up on their own.,Designing housing.,This house is going innin a couple of weeks.,This is a rehabbed home,ndone in four days.,This is a utility roomnfor a woman who is on a walker.,She's 70 years old.nThis is what FEMA gave her.,600 bucks, happened two days ago.,We put together, very quickly, a washroom.,It's built, it's running and she justnstarted a business today,,where she's washingnother people's clothes. 
 These are the Calhouns.,They're photographers who had documentednthe Lower Ninth for the last 40 years.,That was their home,nand these are the photographs they took.,And we're helping, working with themnto create a new building.,Projects we've done.,Projects we've been a part of, support.,Why don't aid agencies do this?,This is the UN tent.,This is the new UN tent,njust introduced this year.,Quick to assemble.,It's got a flap -- that's the invention.,It took 20 years to design thisnand get it implemented in the field.,I was 12 years old.,There's a problem here. 
 Luckily, we're not alone.,There are hundreds and hundredsnand hundreds and hundreds,and hundreds of architectsnand designers and inventors,around the world that are gettingninvolved in humanitarian work.,More hemp houses -- it's a themenin Japan, apparently.,I'm not sure what they're smoking. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is a Grip Clip,ndesigned by somebody who said,,"All you need is some waynto attach membrane structures,to physical support beams.",This guy designed for NASA,nis now doing housing.,I'm going to whip through this quickly,,because I know I've gotnonly a couple of minutes. 
 So this is all done in the last two years.,I showed you somethingnthat took 20 years to do.,And this is just a selection of things,that were builtnin the last couple of years.,From Brazil to India,,Mexico,,Alabama,,China,,Israel,,Palestine,,Vietnam. 
 The average age of a designernwho gets involved in this project is 32 --,that's how old I am.,So it's a young --,I just have to stop here,nbecause Arup is in the room,,and this is the best-designedntoilet in the world.,If you're ever, ever in India,ngo use this toilet. 
 (Laughter) 
 Chris Luebkeman will tell you why.,I'm sure that's how he wantednto spend the party.,But the future is not going to benthe sky-scraping cities of New York,,but this.,And when you look at this, you see crisis.,What I see is many, many inventors.,One billion people live in abject poverty.,We hear about them all the time.,Four billion live in growingnbut fragile economies.,One in seven livenin unplanned settlements.,If we do nothing about the housing crisisnthat's about to happen,,in 20 years, one in three peoplenwill live in an unplanned settlement,or a refugee camp.,Look left, look right:none of you will be there.,How do we improve the living standardsnof five billion people?,With 10 million solutions. 
 So I wish to develop a community,that actively embracesninnovative and sustainable design,to improve the livingnconditions for everyone. 
 Chris Anderson: Wait a sec --nthat's your wish? 
 CS: That's my wish. 
 CA: That's his wish! 
 (Applause) 
 CS: We started Architecture for Humanitynwith 700 dollars and a website.,So Chris somehow decidednto give me 100,000.,So why not this many people?,Open-source architecture is the way to go.,You have a diverse communitynof participants --,and we're not just talkingnabout inventors and designers,,but we're talking about the funding model.,My role is not as a designer;,it's as a conduit between the design worldnand the humanitarian world.,And what we need is somethingnthat replicates me globally,,because I haven't slept in seven years. 
 (Laughter) 
 Secondly, what will this thing be?,Designers want to respondnto issues of humanitarian crisis,,but they don't wantnsome company in the West,taking their ideanand basically profiting from it.,So Creative Commons has developednthe Developing Nations license.,And what that meansnis that a designer can --,The Siyathemba project I showed,was the first ever building to havena Creative Commons license on it.,As soon as that is built, anyonenin Africa or any developing nation,can take the construction documentsnand replicate it for free. 
 (Applause) 
 So why not allow designersnthe opportunity to do this,,but still protect their rights here?,We want to have a communitynwhere you can upload ideas,,and those ideas can be testednin an earthquake, in flood,,in all sorts of austere environments.,The reason that's important,is I don't want to waitnfor the next Katrina,to find out if my house works.,That's too late, we need to do it now.,So doing that globally --,and I want this whole thingnto work multi-lingually.,When you look at the face of an architect,nmost people think a gray-haired white guy.,I don't see that;nI see the face of the world.,So I want everyonenfrom all over the planet,to be able to be a partnof this design and development.,The idea of needs-based competitions --,XPRIZE for the other 98 percent,nif you want to call it that. 
 We also want to looknat ways of matchmaking,and putting funding partners together,,and the idea of integratingnmanufacturers --,fab labs in every country.,When I hear about the $100 laptopnand it's going to educate every child --,educate every designer in the world.,Put one in every favela,nevery slum settlement.,Because you know what?nInnovation will happen.,And I need to know that.nIt's called the leap-back.,We talk about leapfrog technologies. 
 I write with Worldchanging,,and the one thingnwe've been talking about is,,I learn more on the groundnthan I've ever learned here.,So let's take those ideas,nadapt them, and we can use them.,These ideas are supposed to be adaptable;,they should haventhe potential for evolution;,they should be developednby every nation in the world,and useful for every nation in the world.,What will it take? 
 There should be a sheet.,I don't have time to read this,nbecause I'm going to be yanked off. 
 CA: Let's just leave it up for a sec. 
 CS: Well, what will it take?nYou guys are smart.,So it's going to take a lotnof computing power,,because I want the ideanthat any laptop anywhere in the world,can plug into the system,and be able to not only participatenin developing these designs,,but utilize the designs.,Also, a process of reviewing the designs.,I want every Arup engineernin the world to check and make sure,that we're doing stuff that's standing,,because those guysnare the best in the world.,Plug.,And so, you know, I want these -- 
 I just should note: I have two laptopsnand one of them is there,,and that has 3000 designs on it.,If I drop that laptop ...,What happens?,So it's important to haventhese proven ideas put up there,,easy to use, easy to get ahold of.,My mom once said, "There's nothing worsenthan being all mouth and no trousers." 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm fed up of talking about making change.,You only make it by doing it.,We've changed FEMA guidelines;nwe've changed public policy;,we've changed international response --nbased on building things.,So for me, it's important that we createna real conduit for innovation,,and that it's free innovation.,Think of free culture --nthis is free innovation.,Somebody said this a couple of years back.,I will give points for those who know it.,But I think the man was mayben25 years too early. 
 So let's do it. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I can't help but this wish:,to think about when you're a little kid,nand all your friends ask you,,"If a genie could give younone wish in the world,,what would it be?",And I always answered,,"Well, I'd want the wish,to have the wisdom to knownexactly what to wish for.",Well, then you'd be screwed,,because you'd know what to wish for,nand you'd use up your wish,,and now, since we only have one wish --nunlike last year they had three wishes --,I'm not going to wish for that. 
 So let's get to what I would like,nwhich is world peace.,And I know what you're thinking:,You're thinking, "The poor girl up there,,she thinks she's at a beauty pageant.,She's not. She's at the TED Prize.",(Laughter),But I really do think it makes sense.,And I think thatnthe first step to world peace,is for people to meet each other.,I've met a lot of differentnpeople over the years,,and I've filmed some of them,,from a dotcom executive in New Yorknwho wanted to take over the world,,to a military press officer in Qatar,,who would rather not take over the world.,If you've seen the filmn"Control Room" that was sent out,,you'd understand a little bit why.,(Applause),Thank you.,Wow! Some of you watched it.nThat's great. That's great. 
 So basically what I'd likento talk about today,is a way for people to travel,,to meet people in a different way than --,because you can't travelnall over the world at the same time.,And a long time ago --nwell, about 40 years ago --,my mom had an exchange student.,And I'm going to show younslides of the exchange student.,This is Donna.,This is Donna at the Statue of Liberty.,This is my mother and auntnteaching Donna how to ride a bike.,This is Donna eating ice cream.,And this is Donna teaching my auntnhow to do a Filipino dance.,I really think as the worldnis getting smaller,,it becomes more and more important,that we learn each other's dance moves,,that we meet each other,nwe get to know each other,,we are able to figure outna way to cross borders,,to understand each other, to understandnpeople's hopes and dreams,,what makes them laugh and cry.,And I know that we can'tnall do exchange programs,,and I can't force everybody to travel;,I've already talked about thatnto Chris and Amy,,and they said thatnthere's a problem with this:,You can't force people, free will.,And I totally support that,nso we're not forcing people to travel.,But I'd like to talknabout another way to travel,that doesn't requirena ship or an airplane,,and just requires a movie camera,na projector and a screen.,And that's what I'm goingnto talk to you about today. 
 I was asked that I speak a little bitnabout where I personally come from,,and Cameron, I don't know hownyou managed to get out of that one,,but I think that building bridgesnis important to me,because of where I come from.,I'm the daughter of an American mother,and an Egyptian-Lebanese-Syrian father.,So I'm the living productnof two cultures coming together.,No pun intended.,(Laughter),And I've also been called,,as an Egyptian-Lebanese-Syrian Americannwith a Persian name,,the "Middle East Peace Crisis." 
 So maybe me starting to takenpictures was some kind of way,to bring both sidesnof my family together --,a way to take the worlds with me,na way to tell stories visually.,It all kind of started that way,,but I think that I really realizednthe power of the image,when I first wentnto the garbage-collecting village,in Egypt, when I was about 16.,My mother took me there.,She's somebody who believes stronglynin community service,,and decided that this was somethingnthat I needed to do.,And so I went there and I metnsome amazing women there.,There was a center there,,where they were teachingnpeople how to read and write,,and get vaccinationsnagainst the many diseases,you can get from sorting through garbage.,And I began teaching there.,I taught English, and I metnsome incredible women there.,I met people that livenseven people to a room,,barely can afford their evening meal,,yet lived with this strengthnof spirit and sense of humor,and just incredible qualities. 
 I got drawn into this communitynand I began to take pictures there.,I took pictures of weddingsnand older family members --,things that they wanted memories of.,About two years after I startedntaking these pictures,,the UN Conferencenon Population and Development,asked me to show them at the conference.,So I was 18; I was very excited.,It was my first exhibit of photographsnand they were all put up there,,and after about two days,nthey all came down except for three.,People were very upset,,very angry that I was showingnthese dirty sides of Cairo,,and why didn't I cutnthe dead donkey out of the frame?,And as I sat there, I got very depressed.,I looked at this big empty wallnwith three lonely photographs,that were, you know,nvery pretty photographs,and I was like, "I failed at this.",But I was looking at this intensenemotion and intense feeling,that had come out of peoplenjust seeing these photographs.,Here I was, this 18-year-old pipsqueaknthat nobody listened to,,and all of a sudden,nI put these photographs on the wall,,and there were arguments,nand they had to be taken down.,And I saw the power of the image,nand it was incredible.,And I think the most important reactionnthat I saw there was actually from people,that would never have gonento the garbage village themselves,,that would never have seennthat the human spirit could thrive,in such difficult circumstances.,And I think it was at that point,that I decided I wanted to usenphotography and film,to somehow bridge gaps,nto bridge cultures,,bring people together, cross borders.,And so that's what reallynkind of started me off. 
 Did a stint at MTV, made a filmncalled "Startup.com,",and I've done a couple of music films.,But in 2003, when the warnin Iraq was about to start,,it was a very surreal feeling for me,,because before the war started,,there was kind of this media warnthat was going on.,And I was watching television in New York,,and there seemed to be just onenpoint of view that was coming across,,and the coverage wentnfrom the US State Department,to embedded troops.,And what was coming across on the news,was that there was going to be thisnclean war and precision bombings,,and the Iraqis would be greetingnthe Americans as liberators,,and throwing flowers at their feetnin the streets of Baghdad.,And I knew that therenwas a completely other story,that was taking place in the Middle East,nwhere my parents were.,I knew that there wasna completely other story being told,,and I was thinking, "How are peoplensupposed to communicate with each other,when they're getting completelyndifferent messages,,and nobody knowsnwhat the other's being told?,How are people supposed to havenany kind of common understanding,or know how to move togetherninto the future?,So I knew that I had to go there.,I just wanted to be in the center.,I had no plan. I had no funding.,I didn't even have a camera at the time --nI had somebody bring it there,,because I wantednto get access to Al Jazeera,,George Bush's favorite channel,,and a place which I was very curiousnabout because it's disliked,by many governments across the Arab world,,and also called the mouthpiecenof Osama Bin Laden,by some people in the US government. 
 So I was thinking, this stationnthat's hated by so many people,has to be doing something right.,I've got to go see what this is all about.,And I also wanted to go seenCentral Command,,which was 10 minutes away.,And that way, I could get accessnto how this news was being created --,on the Arab side, reaching the Arab world,,and on the US and Western side,nreaching the US. 
 And when I went there and sat there,,and met these peoplenthat were in the center of it,,and sat with these characters,,I met some surprising,nvery complex people.,And I'd like to share with youna little bit of that experience,of when you sit with somebody,and you film them, and you listen to them,,and you allow them morenthan a five-second sound bite.,The amazing complexity of people emerges. 
 Samir Khader: Business as usual.,Iraq, and then Iraq, and then Iraq.,But between us, if I'm offeredna job with Fox, I'll take it.,To change the Arab nightmareninto the American dream.,I still have that dream.,Maybe I will never be able to do it,,but I have plans for my children.,When they finish high school,,I will send them to Americanto study there.,I will pay for their study.,And they will stay there.,Josh Rushing: The night they showednthe POWs and the dead soldiers --,Al Jazeera showed them --,it was powerful, because Americandoesn't show those kinds of images.,Most of the news in Americanwon't show really gory images,and this showed American soldiersnin uniform, strewn about a floor,,a cold tile floor.,And it was revolting.,It was absolutely revolting.,It made me sick at my stomach.,And then what hit me was,nthe night before,,there had been some kindnof bombing in Basra,,and Al Jazeera had shownnimages of the people.,And they were equally, if not more,nhorrifying -- the images were.,And I remember having seen itnin the Al Jazeera office,,and thought to myself, "Wow, that's gross.,That's bad.",And then going away, and probablyneating dinner or something.,And it didn't affect me as much.,So, the impact that had on me --,me realizing that I just sawnpeople on the other side,,and those people in the Al Jazeera office,must have felt the waynI was feeling that night,,and it upset me on a profound level,that I wasn't as botherednas much the night before.,It makes me hate war.,But it doesn't make me believenthat we're in a world,that can live without war yet. 
 Jehane Noujaim: I was overwhelmednby the response of the film.,We didn't know whethernit would be able to get out there.,We had no funding for it.,We were incredibly luckynthat it got picked up.,And when we showed the film,in both the United Statesnand the Arab world,,we had such incredible reactions.,It was amazing to see how peoplenwere moved by this film.,In the Arab world --,and it's not really by the film,nit's by the characters --,I mean, Josh Rushing wasnthis incredibly complex person,who was thinking about things.,And when I showed the filmnin the Middle East,,people wanted to meet Josh.,He kind of redefined usnas an American population.,People started to ask me,n"Where is this guy now?",Al Jazeera offered him a job.,(Laughter),And Samir, on the other hand,,was also quite an interesting characternfor the Arab world to see,,because it brought out the complexitiesnof this love-hate relationship,that the Arab world has with the West. 
 In the United States, I was blown awaynby the motivations,,the positive motivationsnof the American people,when they'd see this film.,You know, we're criticized abroad,for believing we're the saviorsnof the world in some way,,but the flip side of it is that, actually,,when people do seenwhat is happening abroad,and people's reactionsnto some of our policy abroad,,we feel this power, that we need to --,we feel like we have to getnthe power to change things.,And I saw this with audiences.,This woman came up to menafter the screening and said,,"You know, I know this is crazy.,I saw the bombs being loadednon the planes,,I saw the military going out to war,,but you don't understandnpeople's anger towards us,until you see the people in the hospitalsnand the victims of the war,,and how do we get out of this bubble? 
 How do we understand whatnthe other person is thinking?",Now, I don't know whetherna film can change the world.,But I know the power of it,,I know that it starts people thinkingnabout how to change the world. 
 Now, I'm not a philosopher,,so I feel like I shouldn'tngo into great depth on this,,but let film speak for itselfnand take you to this other world.,Because I believe that film hasnthe ability to take you across borders,,I'd like you to just sit backnand experience for a couple of minutes,being taken into another world.,And these couple clips take you insidenof two of the most difficult conflicts,that we're faced with today.,[The last 48 hours of twonPalestinian suicide bombers.],[Paradise Now]

 Jehane Noujaim: I think everybody'snhad that feeling of sitting in a theater,,in a dark room, with other strangers,nwatching a very powerful film,,and they felt that feelingnof transformation.,And what I'd like to talk about is,how can we use that feeling,to actually createna movement through film?,I've been listening to the talksnin the conference,,and Robert Wright said yesterday,that if we have an appreciationnfor another person's humanity,,then they will havenan appreciation for ours.,And that's what this is about.,It's about connecting people through film,,getting these independentnvoices out there.,Now, Josh Rushing actuallynended up leaving the military,and taking a job with Al Jazeera.,(Laughter),So his feeling is thatnhe's at Al Jazeera International,because he feels likenhe can actually use media,to bridge the gap between East and West.,And that's an amazing thing.,But I've been trying to think about ways,to give power to these independent voices,,to give power to the filmmakers,,to give power to people who are tryingnto use film for change.,And there are incredible organizations,that are out there doing this already.,There's Witness,nthat you heard from earlier.,There's Just Vision, that are workingnwith Palestinians and Israelis,who are working together for peace,nand documenting that process,and getting interviewsnout there and using this film,to take to Congress to shownthat it's a powerful tool,,to show that this is a woman who's hadnher daughter killed in an attack,,and she believes that therenare peaceful ways to solve this.,There's Working Filmsnand there's Current TV,,which is an incredible platformnfor people around the world,to be able to put their --,(Applause),Yeah, it's amazing.,I've watched it and I'm blown away by it,and its potential to bring voicesnfrom around the world --,independent voicesnfrom around the world --,and create a truly democratic,nglobal television. 
 So what can we do to createna platform for these organizations,,to create some momentum,,to get everybody in the worldninvolved in this movement?,I'd like for us to imagine for a second.,Imagine a day when you have everyonencoming together from around the world.,You have towns and villagesnand theaters --,all from around the world,,getting together, and sitting in the dark,,and sharing a communalnexperience of watching a film,,or a couple of films, together.,Watching a film which maybe highlightsna character that is fighting to live,,or just a characternthat defies stereotypes,,makes a joke, sings a song.,Comedies, documentaries, shorts.,This amazing powerncan be used to change people,and to bond people together;nto cross borders,,and have people feel likenthey're having a communal experience.,So if you imagine this daynwhen all around the world,,you have theaters and placesnwhere we project films.,If you imagine projectingnfrom Times Square,to Tahrir Square in Cairo,,the same film in Ramallah,nthe same film in Jerusalem.,You know, we've been talkingnto a friend of mine,about using the side of the Great Pyramid,and the Great Wall of China.,It's endless what you can imagine,,in terms of where you can project films,and where you can haventhis communal experience.,And I believe that this one day,nif we can create it,,this one day can create momentumnfor all of these independent voices.,There isn't an organizationnwhich is connecting the independent voices,of the world to get out there,,and yet I'm hearingnthroughout this conference,that the biggest challenge in our future,is understanding the other,,and having mutual respectnfor the other and crossing borders.,And if film can do that,,and if we can get all of thesendifferent locations in the world,to watch these films together --,this could be an incredible day. 
 So we've already made a partnership,,set up through somebodynfrom the TED community,,John Camen, who introduced mento Steven Apkon,,from the Jacob Burns Film Center.,And we started calling up everybody.,And in the last week,,there have been so many peoplenthat have responded to us,,from as close as Palo Alto,nto Mongolia and to India.,There are people that want to bena part of this global day of film;,to be able to provide a platformnfor independent voices,and independent films to get out there.,Now, we've thoughtnabout a name for this day,,and I'd like to share this with you.,Now, the most amazing partnof this whole process,has been sharing ideas and wishes,,and so I invite younto give brainstorms onto,how does this day echo into the future?,How do we use technology to makenthis day echo into the future,,so that we can build community,and have these communities workingntogether, through the Internet?,There was a time, many, many years ago,,when all of the continentsnwere stuck together.,And we call that landmass Pangea.,So what we'd like to call this day of filmnis Pangea Cinema Day.,And if you just imagine,that all of these peoplenin these towns would be watching,,then I think that we cannactually really make a movement,towards people understandingneach other better. 
 I know that it's very intangible,ntouching people's hearts and souls,,but the only way that I know how to do it,,the only way that I know how to reach outnto somebody's heart and soul,all across the world,nis by showing them a film.,And I know that there are independentnfilmmakers and films out there,that can really make this happen.,And that's my wish.,I guess I'm supposed to give younmy one-sentence wish,,but we're way out of time. 
 Chris Anderson:nThat is an incredible wish.,Pangea Cinema: The daynthe world comes together.

 Chris Anderson: Jill Sobule!If you're here today --,and I'm very happy that you are --,you've all heard aboutnhow sustainable development,will save us from ourselves.,However, when we're not at TED,nwe are often told,that a real sustainability policy agendanis just not feasible,,especially in large urban areasnlike New York City.,And that's because most peoplenwith decision-making powers,,in both the public and the private sector,,really don't feelnas though they're in danger. 
 The reason why I'm here today,nin part, is because of a dog --,an abandoned puppy I foundnback in the rain, back in 1998.,She turned out to bena much bigger dog than I'd anticipated.,When she came into my life, we werenfighting against a huge waste facility,planned for the East River waterfront,despite the fact thatnour small part of New York City,already handled more than 40 percentnof the entire city's commercial waste:,a sewage treatment pelletizing plant,na sewage sludge plant, four power plants,,the world's largestnfood-distribution center,,as well as other industries that bringnmore than 60,000 diesel truck trips,to the area each week.,The area also has one of the lowest ratiosnof parks to people in the city. 
 So when I was contactednby the Parks Department,about a $10,000 seed-grant initiativento help develop waterfront projects,,I thought they were reallynwell-meaning, but a bit naive.,I'd lived in this area all my life,nand you could not get to the river,,because of all the lovely facilitiesnthat I mentioned earlier.,Then, while joggingnwith my dog one morning,,she pulled me into what I thoughtnwas just another illegal dump.,There were weeds and piles of garbagenand other stuff that I won't mention here,,but she kept dragging me,,and lo and behold, at the endnof that lot was the river.,I knew that this forgottennlittle street-end,,abandoned like the dog that broughtnme there, was worth saving.,And I knew it would grownto become the proud beginnings,of the community-led revitalizationnof the new South Bronx. 
 And just like my new dog, it was an ideanthat got bigger than I'd imagined.,We garnered much support along the way,,and the Hunts Point Riverside Parknbecame the first waterfront park,that the South Bronx had hadnin more than 60 years.,We leveraged that $10,000 seed grantnmore than 300 times,,into a $3 million park. 
 And in the fall, I'm going to exchangenmarriage vows with my beloved. 
 (Audience whistles) 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 That's him pressing my buttonsnback there, which he does all the time. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 But those of us livingnin environmental justice communities,are the canary in the coal mine.,We feel the problems right now,nand have for some time.,Environmental justice, for those of younwho may not be familiar with the term,,goes something like this:,no community should be saddlednwith more environmental burdens,and less environmental benefitsnthan any other. 
 Unfortunately, race and classnare extremely reliable indicators,as to where one might find the good stuff,nlike parks and trees,,and where one might find the bad stuff,nlike power plants and waste facilities.,As a black person in America,nI am twice as likely as a white person,to live in an area where air pollutionnposes the greatest risk to my health.,I am five times more likelynto live within walking distance,of a power plant or chemical facility,,which I do.,These land-use decisionsncreated the hostile conditions,that lead to problems like obesity,ndiabetes and asthma.,Why would someone leave their home to gonfor a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood?,Our 27 percent obesity ratenis high even for this country,,and diabetes comes with it.,One out of four South Bronxnchildren has asthma.,Our asthma hospitalization rate,is seven times highernthan the national average.,These impacts are coming everyone's way.,And we all pay dearlynfor solid waste costs,,health problems associatednwith pollution and more odiously,,the cost of imprisoningnour young black and Latino men,,who possess untold amountsnof untapped potential.,Fifty percent of our residentsnlive at or below the poverty line;,25 percent of us are unemployed.,Low-income citizens often usenemergency-room visits as primary care.,This comes at a high cost to taxpayersnand produces no proportional benefits.,Poor people are not only still poor,nthey are still unhealthy. 
 Fortunately, there are many peoplenlike me who are striving for solutions,that won't compromise the lives,of low-income communities of colornin the short term,,and won't destroy us all in the long term.,None of us want that,nand we all have that in common.,So what else do we have in common? 
 Well, first of all,nwe're all incredibly good-looking. 
 (Laughter) 
 Graduated high school, college,npost-graduate degrees,,traveled to interesting places,ndidn't have kids in your early teens,,financially stable, never been imprisoned.,OK. Good. 
 (Laughter) 
 But, besides being a black woman,,I am different from most of younin some other ways.,I watched nearly half of the buildingsnin my neighborhood burn down.,My big brother Lenny fought in Vietnam,,only to be gunned downna few blocks from our home.,Jesus.,I grew up with a crack housenacross the street.,Yeah, I'm a poor black childnfrom the ghetto.,These things make me different from you.,But the things we have in common,set me apart from mostnof the people in my community,,and I am in between these two worlds,with enough of my heartnto fight for justice in the other. 
 So how did things get so different for us?,In the late '40s, my dad --na Pullman porter, son of a slave --,bought a house in the Hunts Pointnsection of the South Bronx,,and a few years later, he married my mom.,At the time, the community was a mostlynwhite, working-class neighborhood.,My dad was not alone.,And as others like him pursuedntheir own version of the American dream,,white flight became commonnin the South Bronx,and in many cities around the country.,Red-lining was used by banks,nwherein certain sections of the city,,including ours, were deemednoff-limits to any sort of investment.,Many landlords believed it was morenprofitable to torch their buildings,and collect insurance money rathernthan to sell under those conditions --,dead or injured former tenantsnnotwithstanding. 
 Hunts Point was formerlyna walk-to-work community,,but now residents had neithernwork nor home to walk to.,A national highway construction boomnwas added to our problems.,In New York State,,Robert Moses spearheadednan aggressive highway-expansion campaign.,One of its primary goals wasnto make it easier,for residents of wealthy communitiesnin Westchester County to go to Manhattan.,The South Bronx, which lies in between,ndid not stand a chance.,Residents were often givennless than a month's notice,before their buildings were razed.,600,000 people were displaced.,The common perception was,that only pimps and pushersnand prostitutes were from the South Bronx.,And if you are toldnfrom your earliest days,that nothing good is going to comenfrom your community,,that it's bad and ugly,,how could it not reflect on you?,So now, my family's propertynwas worthless,,save for that it was our home,nand all we had.,And luckily for me, that homenand the love inside of it,,along with help from teachers, mentorsnand friends along the way, was enough. 
 Now, why is this story important?,Because from a planning perspective,,economic degradationnbegets environmental degradation,,which begets social degradation.,The disinvestment that begannin the 1960s set the stage,for all the environmentalninjustices that were to come.,Antiquated zoning and land-usenregulations are still used to this day,to continue putting pollutingnfacilities in my neighborhood.,Are these factors taken into considerationnwhen land-use policy is decided?,What costs are associatednwith these decisions?,And who pays? Who profits?,Does anything justifynwhat the local community goes through?,This was "planning" -- in quotes --,that did not havenour best interests in mind. 
 Once we realized that, we decidednit was time to do our own planning.,That small park I told you about earlier,was the first stage of buildingna Greenway movement in the South Bronx.,I wrote a one-and-a-quarter-millionndollar federal transportation grant,to design the plannfor a waterfront esplanade,with dedicated on-street bike paths.,Physical improvements help informnpublic policy regarding traffic safety,,the placement of the wastenand other facilities,,which, if done properly, don't compromisena community's quality of life.,They provide opportunitiesnto be more physically active,,as well as local economic development.,Think bike shops, juice stands.,We secured 20 million dollarsnto build first-phase projects.,This is Lafayette Avenue --,and that's redesignednby Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects.,And once this path is constructed,nit'll connect the South Bronx,with more than 400 acresnof Randall's Island Park.,Right now we're separated by about 25 feetnof water, but this link will change that. 
 As we nurture the natural environment,nits abundance will give us back even more.,We run a project called the Bronxn[Environmental] Stewardship Training,,which provides job training in the fieldsnof ecological restoration,,so that folks from our communitynhave the skills to compete,for these well-paying jobs.,Little by little, we're seedingnthe area with green-collar jobs --,and with people that have bothna financial and personal stake,in their environment.,The Sheridan Expresswaynis an underutilized relic,of the Robert Moses era,,built with no regard for the neighborhoodsnthat were divided by it.,Even during rush hour,nit goes virtually unused.,The community creatednan alternative transportation plan,that allows for the removalnof the highway.,We have the opportunity now to bringntogether all the stakeholders,to re-envision how this 28 acresncan be better utilized,for parkland, affordable housingnand local economic development. 
 We also built New York City's first greennand cool roof demonstration project,on top of our offices.,Cool roofs are highly-reflectivensurfaces that don't absorb solar heat,,and pass it on tonthe building or atmosphere.,Green roofs are soil and living plants.,Both can be used insteadnof petroleum-based roofing materials,that absorb heat, contributento urban "heat island" effect,and degrade under the sun,,which we in turn breathe.,Green roofs also retainnup to 75 percent of rainfall,,so they reduce a city's need to fundncostly end-of-pipe solutions --,which, incidentally, are often located,in environmental justicencommunities like mine.,And they provide habitatsnfor our little friends! 
 [Butterfly] 
 (Laughter) 
 So cool! 
 Anyway, the demonstrationnproject is a springboard,for our own green roofninstallation business,,bringing jobs and sustainableneconomic activity to the South Bronx. 
 [Green is the new black ...] 
 (Laughter) (Applause) 
 I like that, too. 
 Anyway, I know Chris told usnnot to do pitches up here,,but since I have all of your attention:,We need investors. End of pitch.,It's better to asknfor forgiveness than permission.,Anyway -- 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 OK. Katrina. 
 Prior to Katrina, the South Bronxnand New Orleans' Ninth Ward,had a lot in common.,Both were largely populatednby poor people of color,,both hotbeds of cultural innovation:nthink hip-hop and jazz.,Both are waterfront communitiesnthat host both industries and residents,in close proximity of one another.,In the post-Katrina era,nwe have still more in common.,We're at best ignored,nand maligned and abused, at worst,,by negligent regulatory agencies,npernicious zoning,and lax governmental accountability.,Neither the destruction of the Ninth Wardnnor the South Bronx was inevitable.,But we have emerged with valuable lessons,about how to dig ourselves out.,We are more than simplynnational symbols of urban blight,or problems to be solvednby empty campaign promises,of presidents come and gone.,Now will we let the Gulf Coastnlanguish for a decade or two,,like the South Bronx did?,Or will we take proactive steps,and learn from the homegrown resourcenof grassroots activists,that have been born of desperationnin communities like mine? 
 Now listen, I do not expect individuals,,corporations or governmentnto make the world a better place,because it is right or moral.,This presentation today only representsnsome of what I've been through.,Like a tiny little bit. You've no clue.,But I'll tell you later,nif you want to know. 
 (Laughter) 
 But -- I know it's the bottom line,nor one's perception of it,,that motivates people in the end.,I'm interested in what I like to callnthe "triple bottom line",that sustainable development can produce.,Developments that have the potentialnto create positive returns,for all concerned:nthe developers, government,and the communitynwhere these projects go up. 
 At present, that's not happeningnin New York City.,And we are operating with a comprehensivenurban-planning deficit.,A parade of government subsidies,is going to propose big-box and stadiumndevelopments in the South Bronx,,but there is scant coordinationnbetween city agencies,on how to deal with the cumulative effectsnof increased traffic, pollution,,solid waste and the impacts on open space.,And their approaches to local economicnand job development are so lame,it's not even funny.,Because on top of that,,the world's richest sports teamnis replacing the House That Ruth Built,by destroying twonwell-loved community parks.,Now, we'll have even lessnthan that stat I told you about earlier.,And although less than 25 percentnof South Bronx residents own cars,,these projects includenthousands of new parking spaces,,yet zip in terms of mass public transit.,Now, what's missing from the larger debate,is a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis,between not fixing an unhealthy,nenvironmentally-challenged community,,versus incorporating structural,nsustainable changes.,My agency is working closelynwith Columbia University and others,to shine a light on these issues. 
 Now let's get this straight:nI am not anti-development.,Ours is a city, not a wilderness preserve.,And I've embraced my inner capitalist.,And, but I don't have -- 
 (Laughter) 
 You probably all have,nand if you haven't, you need to. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I don't have a problemnwith developers making money.,There's enough precedent out therento show that a sustainable,,community-friendly developmentncan still make a fortune.,Fellow TEDsters Bill McDonoughnand Amory Lovins --,both heroes of mine by the way --nhave shown that you can actually do that.,I do have a problemnwith developments that hyper-exploit,politically vulnerablencommunities for profit.,That it continues is a shame upon us all,,because we are all responsiblenfor the future that we create.,But one of the things I donto remind myself of greater possibilities,,is to learn from visionariesnin other cities.,This is my version of globalization. 
 Let's take Bogota.,Poor, Latino, surrounded bynrunaway gun violence and drug trafficking;,a reputation not unlikenthat of the South Bronx.,However, this city was blessednin the late 1990s,with a highly-influentialnmayor named Enrique Peñalosa.,He looked at the demographics.,Few Bogotanos own cars,,yet a huge portion of the city's resourcesnwas dedicated to serving them.,If you're a mayor, you canndo something about that.,His administration narrowed key municipalnthoroughfares from five lanes to three,,outlawed parking on those streets,,expanded pedestrian walkwaysnand bike lanes,,created public plazas,,created one of the most efficientnbus mass-transit systems,in the entire world.,For his brilliant efforts,nhe was nearly impeached.,But as people began to seenthat they were being put first,on issues reflectingntheir day-to-day lives,,incredible things happened.,People stopped littering.,Crime rates dropped, because the streetsnwere alive with people.,His administration attacked severalntypical urban problems at one time,,and on a third-world budget, at that.,We have no excusenin this country, I'm sorry.,But the bottom line is:ntheir people-first agenda,was not meant to penalizenthose who could actually afford cars,,but rather, to provide opportunitiesnfor all Bogotanos to participate,in the city's resurgence.,That development should not come,at the expense of the majoritynof the population,is still consideredna radical idea here in the U.S.,But Bogota's examplenhas the power to change that. 
 You, however, are blessednwith the gift of influence.,That's why you're here and why younvalue the information we exchange.,Use your influence,in support of comprehensive,nsustainable change everywhere.,Don't just talk about it at TED.,This is a nationwide policy agendanI'm trying to build,,and as you all know,npolitics are personal.,Help me make green the new black.,Help me make sustainability sexy.,Make it a part of your dinnernand cocktail conversations.,Help me fight for environmentalnand economic justice.,Support investmentsnwith a triple-bottom-line return.,Help me democratize sustainabilitynby bringing everyone to the table,,and insisting that comprehensivenplanning can be addressed everywhere.,Oh good, glad I have a little more time! 
 Listen -- when I spoke to Mr. Gorenthe other day after breakfast,,I asked him how environmental justicenactivists were going to be included,in his new marketing strategy.,His response was a grant program.,I don't think he understoodnthat I wasn't asking for funding.,I was making him an offer. 
 (Applause) 
 What troubled me was that thisntop-down approach is still around.,Now, don't get me wrong, we need money. 
 (Laughter) 
 But grassroots groupsnare needed at the table,during the decision-making process.,Of the 90 percent of the energynthat Mr. Gore reminded us,that we waste every day,,don't add wasting our energy, intelligence,and hard-earned experience to that count. 
 (Applause) 
 I have come from so farnto meet you like this.,Please don't waste me.,By working together,,we can become one of those small,nrapidly-growing groups of individuals,who actually have the audacity and courage,to believe that we actuallyncan change the world.,We might have come to this conference,from very, very differentnstations in life,,but believe me, we all sharenone incredibly powerful thing.,We have nothing to losenand everything to gain. 
 Ciao, bellos! 
 (Applause)I'm delighted to be here.,I'm honored by the invitation, and thanks.,I would love to talk about stuff that I'm interested in,,but unfortunately, I suspect that what I'm interested in,won't interest many other people.,First off, my badge says I'm an astronomer.,I would love to talk about my astronomy,,but I suspect that the number of people who are interested in radiative transfer,in non-gray atmospheres,and polarization of light in Jupiter's upper atmosphere,are the number of people who'd fit in a bus shelter.,So I'm not going to talk about that.,(Laughter) 
 It would be just as much fun,to talk about some stuff that happened in 1986 and 1987,,when a computer hacker is breaking into our systems,over at Lawrence Berkeley Labs.,And I caught the guys,,and they turned out to be working for what was then the Soviet KGB,,and stealing information and selling it.,And I'd love to talk about that -- and it'd be fun --,but, 20 years later ...,I find computer security, frankly, to be kind of boring.,It's tedious.,I'm -- 
 The first time you do something, it's science.,The second time, it's engineering.,A third time, it's just being a technician.,I'm a scientist. Once I do something, I do something else.,So, I'm not going to talk about that.,Nor am I going to talk about what I think are obvious statements from my first book,,"Silicon Snake Oil," or my second book,,nor am I going to talk about,why I believe computers don't belong in schools. 
 I feel that there's a massive and bizarre idea going around,that we have to bring more computers into schools.,My idea is: no! No!,Get them out of schools, and keep them out of schools.,And I'd love to talk about this,,but I think the argument is so obvious to anyone who's hung around a fourth grade classroom,that it doesn't need much talking about --,but I guess I may be very wrong about that,,and everything else that I've said.,So don't go back and read my dissertation.,It probably has lies in it as well. 
 Having said that, I outlined my talk about five minutes ago.,(Laughter),And if you look at it over here,,the main thing I wrote on my thumb was the future.,I'm supposed to talk about the future, yes?,Oh, right. And my feeling is, asking me to talk about the future is bizarre,,because I've got gray hair,,and so, it's kind of silly for me to talk about the future.,In fact, I think that if you really want to know what the future's going to be,,if you really want to know about the future,,don't ask a technologist, a scientist, a physicist.,No! Don't ask somebody who's writing code. 
 No, if you want to know what society's going to be like in 20 years,,ask a kindergarten teacher.,They know.,In fact, don't ask just any kindergarten teacher,,ask an experienced one.,They're the ones who know what society is going to be like in another generation.,I don't. Nor, I suspect,,do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring.,Certainly, all of us can imagine these cool new things,that are going to be there.,But to me, things aren't the future.,What I ask myself is, what's society is going to be like,,when the kids today are phenomenally good at text messaging,and spend a huge amount of on-screen time,,but have never gone bowling together? 
 Change is happening, and the change that is happening,is not one that is in software.,But that's not what I'm going to talk about.,I'd love to talk about it, it'd be fun,,but I want to talk about what I'm doing now. What am I doing now?,Oh -- the other thing that I think I'd like to talk about,is right over here. Right over here.,Is that visible? What I'd like to talk about is one-sided things.,I would dearly love to talk about,things that have one side.,Because I love Mobius loops. I not only love Mobius loops,,but I'm one of the very few people,,if not the only person in the world, that makes Klein bottles.,Right away, I hope that all of your eyes glaze over.,This is a Klein bottle.,For those of you in the audience who know,,you roll your eyes and say, yup, I know all about it.,It's one sided. It's a bottle whose inside is its outside.,It has zero volume. And it's non-orientable.,It has wonderful properties.,If you take two Mobius loops and sew their common edge together,,you get one of these, and I make them out of glass.,And I'd love to talk to you about this,,but I don't have much in the way of ... things to say because --,(Laughter) 
 (Chris Anderson: I've got a cold.) 
 However, the "D" in TED of course stands for design.,Just two weeks ago I made --,you know, I've been making small, medium and big Klein bottles for the trade.,But what I've just made --,and I'm delighted to show you, first time in public here.,This is a Klein bottle wine bottle,,which, although in four dimensions,it shouldn't be able to hold any fluid at all,,it's perfectly capable of doing so,because our universe has only three spatial dimensions.,And because our universe is only three spatial dimensions,,it can hold fluids.,So it's highly -- that one's the cool one.,That was a month of my life.,But although I would love to talk about topology with you, I'm not going to.,(Laughter) 
 Instead, I'm going to mention my mom,,who passed away last summer.,Had collected photographs of me, as mothers will do.,Could somebody put this guy up?,And I looked over her album,and she had collected a picture of me, standing --,well, sitting -- in 1969, in front of a bunch of dials.,And I looked at it, and said, oh my god,,that was me, when I was working at the electronic music studio!,As a technician, repairing and maintaining,the electronic music studio at SUNY Buffalo. And wow!,Way back machine. And I said to myself, oh yeah!,And it sent me back. 
 Soon after that, I found in another picture that she had, a picture of me.,This guy over here of course is me.,This man is Robert Moog,,the inventor of the Moog synthesizer,,who passed away this past August.,Robert Moog was a generous, kind person, extraordinarily competent engineer.,A musician who took time from his life to teach me,,a sophomore, a freshman at SUNY Buffalo.,He'd come up from Trumansburg to teach me,not just about the Moog synthesizer, but we'd be sitting there --,I'm studying physics at the time. This is 1969, 70, 71.,We're studying physics, I'm studying physics,,and he's saying, "That's a good thing to do.,Don't get caught up in electronic music if you're doing physics.",Mentoring me. He'd come up and,spend hours and hours with me.,He wrote a letter of recommendation for me to get into graduate school.,In the background, my bicycle.,I realize that this picture was taken at a friend's living room.,Bob Moog came by and hauled a whole pile of equipment,to show Greg Flint and I things about this.,We sat around talking about Fourier transforms,,Bessel functions, modulation transfer functions,,stuff like this.,Bob's passing this past summer has been a loss to all of us.,Anyone who's a musician has been profoundly influenced by Robert Moog.,(Applause),And I'll just say what I'm about to do. What I'm about to do --,I hope you can recognize that there's a distorted sine wave,,almost a triangular wave upon this Hewlett-Packard oscilloscope. 
 Oh, cool. I can get to this place over here, right?,Kids. Kids is what I'm going to talk about -- is that okay?,It says kids over here, that's what I'd like to talk about.,I've decided that, for me at least,,I don't have a big enough head.,So I think locally and I act locally.,I feel that the best way I can help out anything is to help out very, very locally.,So Ph.D. this, and degree there, and the yadda yadda.,I was talking about this stuff to,some schoolteachers about a year ago.,And one of them, several of them would come up to me and say,,"Well, how come you ain't teaching?",And I said, "Well, I've taught graduate --,I've had graduate students, I've taught undergraduate classes.",No, they said, "If you're so into kids and all this stuff,,how come you ain't over here on the front lines?,Put your money where you mouth is." 
 Is true. Is true. I teach eighth-grade science four days a week.,Not just showing up every now and then.,No, no, no, no, no. I take attendance.,I take lunch hour. (Applause),This is not -- no, no, no, this is not claps.,I strongly suggest that this is a good thing for each of you to do.,Not just show up to class every now and then.,Teach a solid week. Okay, I'm teaching three-quarters time, but good enough.,One of the things that I've done for my science students,is to tell them, "Look, I'm going to teach you college-level physics.,No calculus, I'll cut out that.,You won't need to know trig.,But you will need to know eighth-grade algebra,,and we're going to do serious experiments.,None of this open-to-chapter-seven-and-do-all-the-odd-problem-sets.,We're going to be doing genuine physics.",And that's one of the things I thought I'd do right now.,(High-pitched tone) 
 Oh, before I even turn that on,,one of the things that we did about three weeks ago in my class --,this is through the lens, and one of the things we used a lens for,was to measure the speed of light.,My students in El Cerrito -- with my help, of course,,and with the help of a very beat up oscilloscope --,measured the speed of light.,We were off by 25 percent. How many eighth graders do you know of,who have measured the speed of light?,In addition to that, we've measured the speed of sound.,I'd love to measure the speed of light here.,I was all set to do it and I was thinking, "Aw man,",I was just going to impose upon the powers that be,,and measure the speed of light.,And I'm all set to do it. I'm all set to do it,,but then it turns out that to set up here, you have like 10 minutes to set up!,And there's no time to do it.,So, next time, maybe, I'll measure the speed of light! 
 But meanwhile, let's measure the speed of sound!,Well, the obvious way to measure the speed of sound,is to bounce sound off something and look at the echo.,But, probably -- one of my students, Ariel [unclear], said,,"Could we measure the speed of light using the wave equation?",And all of you know the wave equation is,the frequency times the wavelength of any wave ...,is a constant. When the frequency goes up,,the wavelength comes down. Wavelength goes up,,frequency goes down. So, if we have a wave here --,over here, that's what's interesting --,as the pitch goes up, things get closer,,pitch goes down, things stretch out.,Right? This is simple physics.,All of you know this from eighth grade, remember?,What they didn't tell you in physics -- in eighth-grade physics --,but they should have, and I wish they had,,was that if you multiply the frequency times the wavelength of sound,or light, you get a constant.,And that constant is the speed of sound.,So, in order to measure the speed of sound,,all I've got to do is know its frequency. Well, that's easy.,I've got a frequency counter right here.,Set it up to around A, above A, above A. There's an A, more or less.,Now, so I know the frequency.,It's 1.76 kilohertz. I measure its wavelength.,All I need now is to flip on another beam,,and the bottom beam is me talking, right?,So anytime I talk, you'd see it on the screen.,I'll put it over here, and as I move this away from the source,,you'll notice the spiral.,The slinky moves. We're going through different nodes of the wave,,coming out this way.,Those of you who are physicists, I hear you rolling your eyes,,but bear with me. (Laughter) 
 To measure the wavelength,,all I need to do is measure the distance from here --,one full wave -- over to here.,From here to here is the wavelength of sound.,So, I'll put a measuring tape here, measuring tape here, move it back over to here.,I've moved the microphone 20 centimeters.,0.2 meters from here, back to here, 20 centimeters.,OK, let's go back to Mr. Elmo.,And we'll say the frequency is 1.76 kilohertz, or 1760.,The wavelength was 0.2 meters.,Let's figure out what this is.,(Laughter) (Applause),1.76 times 0.2 over here is 352 meters per second.,If you look it up in the book, it's really 343.,But, here with kludgy material, and lousy drink --,we've been able to measure the speed of sound to --,not bad. Pretty good. 
 All of which comes to what I wanted to say.,Go back to this picture of me a million years ago.,It was 1971, the Vietnam War was going on,,and I'm like, "Oh my God!",I'm studying physics: Landau, Lipschitz, Resnick and Halliday.,I'm going home for a midterm. A riot's going on on campus.,There's a riot! Hey, Elmo's done: off.,There's a riot going on on campus,,and the police are chasing me, right?,I'm walking across campus. Cop comes and looks at me and says,,"You! You're a student.",Pulls out a gun. Goes boom!,And a tear gas canister the size of a Pepsi can goes by my head. Whoosh!,I get a breath of tear gas and I can't breathe.,This cop comes after me with a rifle.,He wants to clunk me over the head!,I'm saying, "I got to clear out of here!",I go running across campus quick as I can. I duck into Hayes Hall.,It's one of these bell-tower buildings.,The cop's chasing me.,Chasing me up the first floor, second floor, third floor.,Chases me into this room.,The entranceway to the bell tower.,I slam the door behind me, climb up,,go past this place where I see a pendulum ticking.,And I'm thinking, "Oh yeah,,the square root of the length is proportional to its period." (Laughter) 
 I keep climbing up, go back.,I go to a place where a dowel splits off.,There's a clock, clock, clock, clock.,The time's going backwards because I'm inside of it.,I'm thinking of Lorenz contractions and Einsteinian relativity.,I climb up, and there's this place, way in the back,,that you climb up this wooden ladder.,I pop up the top, and there's a cupola.,A dome, one of these ten-foot domes.,I'm looking out and I'm seeing the cops bashing students' heads,,shooting tear gas, and watching students throwing bricks.,And I'm asking, "What am I doing here? Why am I here?",Then I remember what my English teacher in high school said.,Namely, that when they cast bells,,they write inscriptions on them.,So, I wipe the pigeon manure off one of the bells, and I look at it.,I'm asking myself, "Why am I here?" 
 So, at this time, I'd like to tell you the words inscribed,upon the Hayes Hall tower bells:,"All truth is one.,In this light, may science and religion endeavor here,for the steady evolution of mankind, from darkness to light,,from narrowness to broad-mindedness, from prejudice to tolerance.,It is the voice of life, which calls us to come and learn.",Thank you very much.Has anyone ever been to Aspen, Colorado?,It's not a joke yet;,those aren't the jokes.,Is this thing off?,I went to Aspen recently,and stumbled into this song.

 (Applause)If you haven't ordered yet, I generally find the rigatoni with the spicy tomato sauce,goes best with diseases of the small intestine. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, sorry -- it just feels like I should be doing stand-up up here because of the setting.,No, what I want to do is take you back to 1854,in London for the next few minutes, and tell the story --,in brief -- of this outbreak,,which in many ways, I think, helped create the world that we live in today,,and particularly the kind of city that we live in today.,This period in 1854, in the middle part of the 19th century,,in London's history, is incredibly interesting for a number of reasons.,But I think the most important one is that,London was this city of 2.5 million people,,and it was the largest city on the face of the planet at that point.,But it was also the largest city that had ever been built. 
 And so the Victorians were trying to live through,and simultaneously invent a whole new scale of living:,this scale of living that we, you know, now call "metropolitan living.",And it was in many ways, at this point in the mid-1850s, a complete disaster.,They were basically a city living with a modern kind of industrial metropolis,with an Elizabethan public infrastructure.,So people, for instance, just to gross you out for a second,,had cesspools of human waste in their basement. Like, a foot to two feet deep.,And they would just kind of throw the buckets down there,and hope that it would somehow go away,,and of course it never really would go away.,And all of this stuff, basically, had accumulated to the point,where the city was incredibly offensive to just walk around in. 
 It was an amazingly smelly city. Not just because of the cesspools,,but also the sheer number of livestock in the city would shock people.,Not just the horses, but people had cows in their attics that they would use for milk,,that they would hoist up there and keep them in the attic,until literally their milk ran out and they died,,and then they would drag them off to the bone boilers down the street.,So, you would just walk around London at this point,and just be overwhelmed with this stench.,And what ended up happening is that an entire emerging public health system,became convinced that it was the smell that was killing everybody,,that was creating these diseases,that would wipe through the city every three or four years.,And cholera was really the great killer of this period. 
 It arrived in London in 1832, and every four or five years,another epidemic would take 10,000, 20,000 people in London,and throughout the U.K.,And so the authorities became convinced that this smell was this problem.,We had to get rid of the smell.,And so, in fact, they concocted a couple of early, you know,,founding public-health interventions in the system of the city,,one of which was called the "Nuisances Act,",which they got everybody as far as they could,to empty out their cesspools and just pour all that waste into the river.,Because if we get it out of the streets, it'll smell much better,,and -- oh right, we drink from the river.,So what ended up happening, actually,,is they ended up increasing the outbreaks of cholera,because, as we now know, cholera is actually in the water.,It's a waterborne disease, not something that's in the air.,It's not something you smell or inhale; it's something you ingest. 
 And so one of the founding moments of public health in the 19th century,effectively poisoned the water supply of London much more effectively,than any modern day bioterrorist could have ever dreamed of doing.,So this was the state of London in 1854,,and in the middle of all this carnage and offensive conditions,,and in the midst of all this scientific confusion,about what was actually killing people,,it was a very talented classic 19th century multi-disciplinarian named John Snow,,who was a local doctor in Soho in London,,who had been arguing for about four or five years,that cholera was, in fact, a waterborne disease,,and had basically convinced nobody of this.,The public health authorities had largely ignored what he had to say.,And he'd made the case in a number of papers and done a number of studies,,but nothing had really stuck.,And part of -- what's so interesting about this story to me,is that in some ways, it's a great case study in how cultural change happens,,how a good idea eventually comes to win out over much worse ideas.,And Snow labored for a long time with this great insight that everybody ignored. 
 And then on one day, August 28th of 1854,,a young child, a five-month-old girl whose first name we don't know,,we know her only as Baby Lewis, somehow contracted cholera,,came down with cholera at 40 Broad Street.,You can't really see it in this map, but this is the map,that becomes the central focus in the second half of my book.,It's in the middle of Soho, in this working class neighborhood,,this little girl becomes sick and it turns out that the cesspool,,that they still continue to have, despite the Nuisances Act,,bordered on an extremely popular water pump,,local watering hole that was well known for the best water in all of Soho,,that all the residents from Soho and the surrounding neighborhoods would go to. 
 And so this little girl inadvertently ended up,contaminating the water in this popular pump,,and one of the most terrifying outbreaks in the history of England,erupted about two or three days later.,Literally, 10 percent of the neighborhood died in seven days,,and much more would have died if people hadn't fled,after the initial outbreak kicked in.,So it was this incredibly terrifying event.,You had these scenes of entire families dying,over the course of 48 hours of cholera,,alone in their one-room apartments, in their little flats.,Just an extraordinary, terrifying scene.,Snow lived near there, heard about the outbreak,,and in this amazing act of courage went directly into the belly of the beast,because he thought an outbreak that concentrated,could actually potentially end up convincing people that,,in fact, the real menace of cholera was in the water supply and not in the air.,He suspected an outbreak that concentrated,would probably involve a single point source.,One single thing that everybody was going to,because it didn't have the traditional slower path,of infections that you might expect. 
 And so he went right in there and started interviewing people.,He eventually enlisted the help of this amazing other figure,,who's kind of the other protagonist of the book --,this guy, Henry Whitehead, who was a local minister,,who was not at all a man of science, but was incredibly socially connected;,he knew everybody in the neighborhood.,And he managed to track down, Whitehead did,,many of the cases of people who had drunk water from the pump,,or who hadn't drunk water from the pump.,And eventually Snow made a map of the outbreak.,He found increasingly that people who drank from the pump were getting sick.,People who hadn't drunk from the pump were not getting sick.,And he thought about representing that,as a kind of a table of statistics of people living in different neighborhoods,,people who hadn't, you know, percentages of people who hadn't,,but eventually he hit upon the idea,that what he needed was something that you could see.,Something that would take in a sense a higher-level view,of all this activity that had been happening in the neighborhood. 
 And so he created this map,,which basically ended up representing all the deaths in the neighborhoods,as black bars at each address.,And you can see in this map, the pump right at the center of it,and you can see that one of the residences down the way,had about 15 people dead.,And the map is actually a little bit bigger.,As you get further and further away from the pump,,the deaths begin to grow less and less frequent.,And so you can see this something poisonous,emanating out of this pump that you could see in a glance.,And so, with the help of this map,,and with the help of more evangelizing,that he did over the next few years,and that Whitehead did, eventually, actually,,the authorities slowly started to come around.,It took much longer than sometimes we like to think in this story,,but by 1866, when the next big cholera outbreak came to London,,the authorities had been convinced -- in part because of this story,,in part because of this map -- that in fact the water was the problem. 
 And they had already started building the sewers in London,,and they immediately went to this outbreak,and they told everybody to start boiling their water.,And that was the last time that London has seen a cholera outbreak since.,So, part of this story, I think -- well, it's a terrifying story,,it's a very dark story and it's a story,that continues on in many of the developing cities of the world.,It's also a story really that is fundamentally optimistic,,which is to say that it's possible to solve these problems,if we listen to reason, if we listen to the kind of wisdom of these kinds of maps,,if we listen to people like Snow and Whitehead,,if we listen to the locals who understand,what's going on in these kinds of situations.,And what it ended up doing is making the idea,of large-scale metropolitan living a sustainable one. 
 When people were looking at 10 percent of their neighborhoods dying,in the space of seven days,,there was a widespread consensus that this couldn't go on,,that people weren't meant to live in cities of 2.5 million people.,But because of what Snow did, because of this map,,because of the whole series of reforms,that happened in the wake of this map,,we now take for granted that cities have 10 million people,,cities like this one are in fact sustainable things.,We don't worry that New York City is going to collapse in on itself,quite the way that, you know, Rome did,,and be 10 percent of its size in 100 years or 200 years.,And so that in a way is the ultimate legacy of this map.,It's a map of deaths that ended up creating a whole new way of life,,the life that we're enjoying here today. Thank you very much.Thank you.,And I feel like this whole evening has been very amazing to me.,I feel it's sort of like the Vimalakirti Sutra,,an ancient work from ancient India,in which the Buddha appears at the beginning and a whole bunch of people,come to see him from the biggest city in the area, Vaishali,,and they bring some sort of jeweled parasols to make an offering to him.,All the young people, actually, from the city.,The old fogeys don't come because they're mad at Buddha,,because when he came to their city he accepted --,he always accepts the first invitation that comes to him, from whoever it is,,and the local geisha, a movie-star sort of person,,raced the elders of the city in a chariot and invited him first. 
 So he was hanging out with the movie star, and of course they were grumbling:,"He's supposed to be religious and all this.,What's he doing over there at Amrapali's house with all his 500 monks,",and so on. They were all grumbling, and so they boycotted him.,They wouldn't go listen to him.,But the young people all came.,And they brought this kind of a jeweled parasol, and they put it on the ground.,And as soon as they had laid all these,,all their big stack of these jeweled parasols that they used to carry in ancient India,,he performed a kind of special effect which made it into a giant planetarium,,the wonder of the universe. Everyone looked in that, and they saw in there,the total interconnectedness of all life in all universes. 
 And of course, in the Buddhist cosmos there are millions and billions of planets,with human life on it,,and enlightened beings can see the life on all the other planets.,So they don't -- when they look out and they see those lights that you showed,in the sky -- they don't just see sort of pieces of matter burning,or rocks or flames or gases exploding.,They actually see landscapes and human beings,and gods and dragons and serpent beings and goddesses and things like that. 
 He made that special effect at the beginning,to get everyone to think about interconnection,and interconnectedness and how everything in life was totally interconnected.,And then Leilei -- I know his other name -- told us about interconnection,,and how we're all totally interconnected here,,and how we've all known each other. And of course in the Buddhist universe,,we've already done this already billions of times in many, many lifetimes in the past.,And I didn't give the talk always. You did, and we had to watch you, and so forth.,And we're all still trying to, I guess we're all trying to become TEDsters,,if that's a modern form of enlightenment.,I guess so. Because in a way, if a TEDster relates to all the interconnectedness,of all the computers and everything, it's the forging of a mass awareness,,of where everybody can really know everything,that's going on everywhere in the planet. 
 And therefore it will become intolerable --,what compassion is, is where it will become intolerable for us,,totally intolerable that we sit here in comfort and in pleasure and enjoying,the life of the mind or whatever it is,,and there are people who are absolutely riddled with disease,and they cannot have a bite of food and they have no place,,or they're being brutalized by some terrible person and so forth.,It just becomes intolerable.,With all of us knowing everything, we're kind of forced by technology,to become Buddhas or something, to become enlightened. 
 And of course, we all will be deeply disappointed when we do.,Because we think that because we are kind of tired of what we do,,a little bit tired, we do suffer.,We do enjoy our misery in a certain way.,We distract ourselves from our misery by running around somewhere,,but basically we all have this common misery,that we are sort of stuck inside our skins,and everyone else is out there.,And occasionally we get together with another person stuck in their skin,and the two of us enjoy each other, and each one tries to get out of their own,,and ultimately it fails of course, and then we're back into this thing. 
 Because our egocentric perception -- from the Buddha's point of view, misperception --,is that all we are is what is inside our skin.,And it's inside and outside, self and other,,and other is all very different.,And everyone here is unfortunately carrying that habitual perception,,a little bit, right?,You know, someone sitting next to you in a seat -- that's OK because you're in a theater,,but if you were sitting on a park bench and someone came up and sat that close to you,,you'd freak out.,What do they want from me? Like, who's that?,And so you wouldn't sit that close to another person,because of your notion that it's you versus the universe -- that's all Buddha discovered.,Because that cosmic basic idea that it is us all alone, each of us,,and everyone else is different,,then that puts us in an impossible situation, doesn't it?,Who is it who's going to get enough attention from the world?,Who's going to get enough out of the world?,Who's not going to be overrun by an infinite number of other beings --,if you're different from all the other beings? 
 So where compassion comes is where you,surprisingly discover you lose yourself in some way:,through art, through meditation, through understanding, through knowledge actually,,knowing that you have no such boundary,,knowing your interconnectedness with other beings.,You can experience yourself as the other beings,when you see through the delusion of being separated from them.,When you do that, you're forced to feel what they feel.,Luckily, they say -- I still am not sure --,but luckily, they say that when you reach that point because some people have said,in the Buddhist literature, they say, "Oh who would really want to be compassionate?,How awful! I'm so miserable on my own. My head is aching.,My bones are aching. I go from birth to death. I'm never satisfied.,I never have enough, even if I'm a billionaire, I don't have enough.,I need a hundred billion." So I'm like that.,Imagine if I had to feel even a hundred other people's suffering.,It would be terrible. 
 But apparently, this is a strange paradox of life.,When you're no longer locked in yourself,,and as the wisdom or the intelligence or the scientific knowledge,of the nature of the world, that enables you to let your mind spread out,,and empathize, and enhance the basic human ability of empathizing,,and realizing that you are the other being,,somehow by that opening, you can see the deeper nature of life. And you can,,you get away from this terrible iron circle of I, me, me, mine,,like the Beatles used to sing. 
 You know, we really learned everything in the '60s.,Too bad nobody ever woke up to it,,and they've been trying to suppress it since then.,I, me, me, mine. It's like a perfect song, that song. A perfect teaching.,But when we're relieved from that,,we somehow then become interested in all the other beings.,And we feel ourselves differently. It's totally strange.,It's totally strange.,The Dalai Lama always likes to say --,he says that when you give birth in your mind to the idea of compassion,,it's because you realize that you yourself and your pains and pleasures,are finally too small a theater for your intelligence.,It's really too boring whether you feel like this or like that, or what, you know --,and the more you focus on how you feel, by the way, the worse it gets.,Like, even when you're having a good time,,when is the good time over?,The good time is over when you think, how good is it?,And then it's never good enough. 
 I love that Leilei said that the way of helping those who are suffering badly,on the physical plane or on other planes is having a good time,,doing it by having a good time.,I think the Dalai Lama should have heard that. I wish he'd been there to hear that.,He once told me -- he looked kind of sad;,he worries very much about the haves and have-nots.,He looked a little sad, because he said, well, a hundred years ago,,they went and took everything away from the haves.,You know, the big communist revolutions, Russia and China and so forth.,They took it all away by violence,,saying they were going to give it to everyone, and then they were even worse.,They didn't help at all. 
 So what could possibly change this terrible gap that has opened up in the world today?,And so then he looks at me.,So I said, "Well, you know, you're all in this yourself. You teach: it's generosity,",was all I could think of. What is virtue?,But of course, what you said, I think the key to saving the world, the key to compassion,is that it is more fun.,It should be done by fun. Generosity is more fun. That's the key.,Everybody has the wrong idea. They think Buddha was so boring,,and they're so surprised when they meet Dalai Lama and he's fairly jolly.,Even though his people are being genocided --,and believe me, he feels every blow on every old nun's head,,in every Chinese prison. He feels it.,He feels the way they are harvesting yaks nowadays.,I won't even say what they do. But he feels it.,And yet he's very jolly. He's extremely jolly. 
 Because when you open up like that,,then you can't just -- what good does it do to add being miserable with others' misery?,You have to find some vision where you see how hopeful it is,,how it can be changed.,Look at that beautiful thing Chiho showed us. She scared us with the lava man.,She scared us with the lava man is coming,,then the tsunami is coming,,but then finally there were flowers and trees, and it was very beautiful.,It's really lovely. 
 So, compassion means to feel the feelings of others,,and the human being actually is compassion.,The human being is almost out of time.,The human being is compassion because what is our brain for?,Now, Jim's brain is memorizing the almanac.,But he could memorize all the needs of all the beings that he is, he will, he did.,He could memorize all kinds of fantastic things to help many beings.,And he would have tremendous fun doing that. 
 So the first person who gets happy,,when you stop focusing on the self-centered situation of, how happy am I,,where you're always dissatisfied --,as Mick Jagger told us. You never get any satisfaction that way.,So then you decide, "Well, I'm sick of myself.,I'm going to think of how other people can be happy.,I'm going to get up in the morning and think,,what can I do for even one other person, even a dog, my dog, my cat,,my pet, my butterfly?",And the first person who gets happy when you do that,,you don't do anything for anybody else, but you get happier, you yourself,,because your whole perception broadens,and you suddenly see the whole world and all of the people in it.,And you realize that this -- being with these people --,is the flower garden that Chiho showed us.,It is Nirvana.,And my time is up. And I know the TED commandments.,Thank you.I'd like to begin this song I wrote,about ceaseless yearning and never-ending want,with a poem of popular Petrarchan paradoxes,by Sir Thomas Wyatt the Elder:,"I find no peace, and all my war is done;,I fear and hope, I burn and freeze like ice;,I fly above the wind,,and yet I cannot arise;,And naught I have,,and all the world I seize upon."
