In the last 50 years,,we've been building the suburbs,with a lot of unintended consequences.,And I'm going to talk about some of those consequences,and just present a whole bunch of really interesting projects,that I think give us tremendous reasons,to be really optimistic,that the big design and development project of the next 50 years,is going to be retrofitting suburbia.,So whether it's redeveloping dying malls,or re-inhabiting dead big-box stores,or reconstructing wetlands,out of parking lots,,I think the fact is,the growing number,of empty and under-performing,,especially retail, sites,throughout suburbia,gives us actually a tremendous opportunity,to take our least-sustainable,landscapes right now,and convert them into,more sustainable places.,And in the process, what that allows us to do,is to redirect a lot more of our growth,back into existing communities,that could use a boost,,and have the infrastructure in place,,instead of continuing,to tear down trees,and to tear up the green space out at the edges. 
 So why is this important?,I think there are any number of reasons,,and I'm just going to not get into detail but mention a few.,Just from the perspective of climate change,,the average urban dweller in the U.S.,has about one-third the carbon footprint,of the average suburban dweller,,mostly because suburbanites drive a lot more,,and living in detached buildings,,you have that much more exterior surface,to leak energy out of.,So strictly from,a climate change perspective,,the cities are already,relatively green.,The big opportunity,to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,is actually in urbanizing,the suburbs.,All that driving that we've been doing out in the suburbs,,we have doubled the amount of miles we drive.,It's increased our dependence,on foreign oil,despite the gains in fuel efficiency.,We're just driving so much more;,we haven't been able to keep up technologically. 
 Public health is another reason,to consider retrofitting.,Researchers at the CDC and other places,have increasingly been linking,suburban development patterns,with sedentary lifestyles.,And those have been linked then,with the rather alarming,,growing rates of obesity,,shown in these maps here,,and that obesity has also been triggering,great increases in heart disease,and diabetes,to the point where a child born today,has a one-in-three chance,of developing diabetes.,And that rate has been escalating at the same rate,as children not walking,to school anymore,,again, because of our development patterns. 
 And then there's finally -- there's the affordability question.,I mean, how affordable is it,to continue to live in suburbia,with rising gas prices?,Suburban expansion to cheap land,,for the last 50 years --,you know the cheap land out on the edge --,has helped generations of families,enjoy the American dream.,But increasingly,,the savings promised,by drive-till-you-qualify affordability --,which is basically our model --,those savings are wiped out,when you consider the transportation costs.,For instance, here in Atlanta,,about half of households,make between $20,000 and $50,000 a year,,and they are spending 29 percent of their income,on housing,and 32 percent,on transportation.,I mean, that's 2005 figures.,That's before we got up to the four bucks a gallon.,You know, none of us,really tend to do the math on our transportation costs,,and they're not going down,any time soon. 
 Whether you love suburbia's leafy privacy,or you hate its soulless commercial strips,,there are reasons why it's important to retrofit.,But is it practical?,I think it is.,June Williamson and I have been researching this topic,for over a decade,,and we've found over 80,varied projects.,But that they're really all market driven,,and what's driving the market in particular --,number one -- is major demographic shifts.,We all tend to think of suburbia,as this very family-focused place,,but that's really not the case anymore.,Since 2000,,already two-thirds of households in suburbia,did not have kids in them.,We just haven't caught up with the actual realities of this.,The reasons for this have a lot to with,the dominance of the two big,demographic groups right now:,the Baby Boomers retiring --,and then there's a gap,,Generation X, which is a small generation.,They're still having kids --,but Generation Y hasn't even started,hitting child-rearing age.,They're the other big generation. 
 So as a result of that,,demographers predict,that through 2025,,75 to 85 percent of new households,will not have kids in them.,And the market research, consumer research,,asking the Boomers and Gen Y,what it is they would like,,what they would like to live in,,tells us there is going to be a huge demand --,and we're already seeing it --,for more urban lifestyles,within suburbia.,That basically, the Boomers want to be able to age in place,,and Gen Y would like to live,an urban lifestyle,,but most of their jobs will continue to be out in suburbia. 
 The other big dynamic of change,is the sheer performance of,underperforming asphalt.,Now I keep thinking this would be a great name,for an indie rock band,,but developers generally use it,to refer to underused parking lots --,and suburbia is full of them.,When the postwar suburbs were first built,out on the cheap land,away from downtown,,it made sense to just build,surface parking lots.,But those sites have now been leapfrogged,and leapfrogged again,,as we've just continued to sprawl,,and they now have,a relatively central location.,It no longer just makes sense.,That land is more valuable than just surface parking lots.,It now makes sense to go back in,,build a deck and build up,on those sites.,So what do you do,with a dead mall,,dead office park?,It turns out, all sorts of things.,In a slow economy like ours,,re-inhabitation is,one of the more popular strategies. 
 So this happens to be,a dead mall in St. Louis,that's been re-inhabited as art-space.,It's now home to artist studios,,theater groups, dance troupes.,It's not pulling in as much tax revenue,as it once was,,but it's serving its community.,It's keeping the lights on.,It's becoming, I think, a really great institution.,Other malls have been re-inhabited,as nursing homes,,as universities,,and as all variety of office space.,We also found a lot of examples,of dead big-box stores,that have been converted into,all sorts of community-serving uses as well --,lots of schools, lots of churches,and lots of libraries like this one. 
 This was a little grocery store, a Food Lion grocery store,,that is now a public library.,In addition to, I think, doing a beautiful adaptive reuse,,they tore up some of the parking spaces,,put in bioswales to collect and clean the runoff,,put in a lot more sidewalks,to connect to the neighborhoods.,And they've made this,,what was just a store along a commercial strip,,into a community gathering space.,This one is a little L-shaped strip shopping center,in Phoenix, Arizona.,Really all they did was they gave it a fresh coat of bright paint,,a gourmet grocery,,and they put up a restaurant in the old post office.,Never underestimate the power of food,to turn a place around,and make it a destination.,It's been so successful, they've now taken over the strip across the street.,The real estate ads in the neighborhood,all very proudly proclaim,,"Walking distance to Le Grande Orange,",because it provided its neighborhood,with what sociologists like to call,"a third place.",If home is the first place,and work is the second place,,the third place is where you go to hang out,and build community.,And especially as suburbia is becoming,less centered on the family,,the family households,,there's a real hunger,for more third places. 
 So the most dramatic retrofits,are really those in the next category,,the next strategy: redevelopment.,Now, during the boom, there were several,really dramatic redevelopment projects,where the original building,was scraped to the ground and then the whole site was rebuilt,at significantly greater density,,a sort of compact, walkable urban neighborhoods.,But some of them have been much more incremental.,This is Mashpee Commons,,the oldest retrofit that we've found.,And it's just incrementally, over the last 20 years,,built urbanism,on top of its parking lots.,So the black and white photo shows,the simple 60's strip shopping center.,And then the maps above that,show its gradual transformation,into a compact,,mixed-use New England village,,and it has plans now that have been approved,for it to connect,to new residential neighborhoods,across the arterials,and over to the other side.,So, you know, sometimes it's incremental.,Sometimes, it's all at once. 
 This is another infill project on the parking lots,,this one of an office park outside of Washington D.C.,When Metrorail expanded transit into the suburbs,and opened a station nearby to this site,,the owners decided,to build a new parking deck,and then insert on top of their surface lots,a new Main Street, several apartments,and condo buildings,,while keeping the existing office buildings.,Here is the site in 1940:,It was just a little farm,in the village of Hyattsville.,By 1980, it had been subdivided,into a big mall on one side,and the office park on the other,and then some buffer sites for a library,and a church to the far right.,Today, the transit,,the Main Street and the new housing,have all been built.,Eventually, I expect that the streets,will probably extend through a redevelopment of the mall.,Plans have already been announced,for a lot of those garden apartments,above the mall to be redeveloped.,Transit is a big driver of retrofits.,So here's what it looks like.,You can sort of see the funky new condo buildings,in between the office buildings,and the public space and the new Main Street. 
 This one is one of my favorites, Belmar.,I think they really built an attractive place here,and have just employed all-green construction.,There's massive P.V. arrays on the roofs,as well as wind turbines.,This was a very large mall,on a hundred-acre superblock.,It's now 22,walkable urban blocks,with public streets,,two public parks, eight bus lines,and a range of housing types,,and so it's really given Lakewood, Colorado,the downtown,that this particular suburb never had.,Here was the mall in its heyday.,They had their prom in the mall. They loved their mall.,So here's the site in 1975,with the mall.,By 1995, the mall has died.,The department store has been kept --,and we found this was true in many cases.,The department stores are multistory; they're better built.,They're easy to be re-adapted.,But the one story stuff ...,that's really history. 
 So here it is at projected build-out.,This project, I think, has great connectivity,to the existing neighborhoods.,It's providing 1,500 households with the option,of a more urban lifestyle.,It's about two-thirds built out right now.,Here's what the new Main Street looks like.,It's very successful,,and it's helped to prompt --,eight of the 13,regional malls in Denver,have now, or have announced plans to,be, retrofitted.,But it's important to note that all of this retrofitting,is not occurring --,just bulldozers are coming and just plowing down the whole city.,No, it's pockets of walkability,on the sites of,under-performing properties.,And so it's giving people more choices,,but it's not taking away choices. 
 But it's also not really enough,to just create pockets of walkability.,You want to also try to get more systemic transformation.,We need to also retrofit the corridors themselves.,So this is one that has been,retrofitted in California.,They took the commercial strip,shown on the black-and-white images below,,and they built a boulevard,that has become the Main Street for their town.,And it's transformed from being,an ugly, unsafe,,undesirable address,,to becoming a beautiful,,attractive, dignified sort of good address.,I mean now we're hoping we start to see it;,they've already built City Hall, attracted two hotels.,I could imagine beautiful housing going up along there,without tearing down another tree.,So there's a lot of great things,,but I'd love to see more corridors getting retrofitting. 
 But densification,is not going to work everywhere.,Sometimes re-greening,is really the better answer.,There's a lot to learn from successful,landbanking programs,in cities like Flint, Michigan.,There's also a burgeoning suburban farming movement --,sort of victory gardens meets the Internet.,But perhaps one of the most important re-greening aspects,is the opportunity to restore,the local ecology,,as in this example outside of Minneapolis.,When the shopping center died,,the city restored the site's,original wetlands,,creating lakefront property,,which then attracted private investment,,the first private investment to this very low-income neighborhood,in over 40 years.,So they've managed to both restore the local ecology,and the local economy at the same time.,This is another re-greening example.,It also makes sense in very strong markets.,This one in Seattle,is on the site of a mall parking lot,adjacent to a new transit stop.,And the wavy line,is a path alongside a creek that has now been daylit.,The creek had been culverted under the parking lot.,But daylighting our creeks,really improves their water quality,and contributions to habitat. 
 So I've shown you some of,the first generation of retrofits.,What's next?,I think we have three challenges for the future.,The first is to plan retrofitting,much more systemically,at the metropolitan scale.,We need to be able to target,which areas really should be re-greened.,Where should we be redeveloping?,And where should we be encouraging re-inhabitation?,These slides just show two images,from a larger project,that looked at trying to do that for Atlanta.,I led a team that was asked to imagine,Atlanta 100 years from now.,And we chose to try to reverse sprawl,through three simple moves -- expensive, but simple.,One, in a hundred years,,transit on all major,rail and road corridors.,Two, in a hundred years,,thousand foot buffers,on all stream corridors.,It's a little extreme, but we've got a little water problem.,In a hundred years,,subdivisions that simply end up too close to water,or too far from transit won't be viable.,And so we've created the eco-acre,transfer-to-transfer development rights,to the transit corridors,and allow the re-greening,of those former subdivisions,for food and energy production. 
 So the second challenge,is to improve the architectural design quality,of the retrofits.,And I close with this image,of democracy in action:,This is a protest that's happening,on a retrofit in Silver Spring, Maryland,on an Astroturf town green.,Now, retrofits are often accused,of being examples of faux downtowns,and instant urbanism,,and not without reason; you don't get much more phony,than an Astroturf town green.,I have to say, these are very hybrid places.,They are new but trying to look old.,They have urban streetscapes,,but suburban parking ratios.,Their populations are,more diverse than typical suburbia,,but they're less diverse than cities.,And they are,public places,,but that are managed by private companies.,And just the surface appearance,are often -- like the Astroturf here --,they make me wince.,So, you know, I mean I'm glad that,the urbanism is doing its job.,The fact that a protest is happening,really does mean,that the layout of the blocks, the streets and blocks, the putting in of public space,,compromised as it may be,,is still a really great thing.,But we've got to get the architecture better. 
 The final challenge is for all of you.,I want you to join the protest,and start demanding,more sustainable suburban places --,more sustainable places, period.,But culturally,,we tend to think that downtowns,should be dynamic, and we expect that.,But we seem to have an expectation,that the suburbs should forever remain frozen,in whatever adolescent form,they were first given birth to.,It's time to let them grow up,,so I want you,to all support the zoning changes,,the road diets, the infrastructure improvements,and the retrofits that are coming soon to a neighborhood near you. 
 Thank you.Good afternoon.,If you have followed,diplomatic news in the past weeks,,you may have heard of a kind of crisis,between China and the U.S.,regarding cyberattacks,against the American company Google.,Many things have been said about this.,Some people have called a cyberwar,what may actually be,just a spy operation --,and obviously, a quite mishandled one.,However, this episode reveals,the growing anxiety in the Western world,regarding these emerging cyber weapons. 
 It so happens that these weapons are dangerous.,They're of a new nature:,they could lead the world,into a digital conflict,that could turn into an armed struggle.,These virtual weapons can also destroy the physical world.,In 1982, in the middle of the Cold War,in Soviet Siberia,,a pipeline exploded with a burst of 3 kilotons,,the equivalent of a fourth of the Hiroshima bomb.,Now we know today -- this was revealed,by Thomas Reed,,Ronald Reagan's former U.S. Air Force Secretary --,this explosion was actually the result,of a CIA sabotage operation,,in which they had managed,to infiltrate the IT management systems,of that pipeline. 
 More recently, the U.S. government revealed,that in September 2008, more than 3 million people,in the state of Espirito Santo in Brazil,were plunged into darkness,,victims of a blackmail operation from cyber pirates.,Even more worrying for the Americans,,in December 2008 the holiest of holies,,the IT systems of CENTCOM,,the central command,managing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,,may have been infiltrated by hackers,who used these:,plain but infected USB keys.,And with these keys, they may have been able,to get inside CENTCOM's systems,,to see and hear everything,,and maybe even infect some of them.,As a result, the Americans take the threat very seriously.,I'll quote General James Cartwright,,Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,,who says in a report to Congress,that cyberattacks could be as powerful as,weapons of mass destruction.,Moreover, the Americans have decided,to spend over 30 billion dollars,in the next five years,to build up their cyberwar capabilities. 
 And across the world today, we see,a sort of cyber arms race,,with cyberwar units,built up by countries like North Korea,or even Iran.,Yet, what you'll never hear,from spokespeople,from the Pentagon or the French Department of Defence,is that the question isn't really,who's the enemy, but actually,the very nature of cyber weapons.,And to understand why, we must look at how,,through the ages, military technologies,have maintained or destroyed,world peace.,For example,,if we'd had TEDxParis,350 years ago,,we would have talked about the military innovation of the day --,the massive Vauban-style fortifications --,and we could have predicted,a period of stability in the world or in Europe.,which was indeed the case in Europe,between 1650 and 1750. 
 Similarly, if we'd had this talk,30 or 40 years ago, we would have seen,how the rise of nuclear weapons,,and the threat of mutually assured destruction they imply,,prevents a direct fight between the two superpowers.,However, if we'd had this talk 60 years ago,,we would have seen how the emergence,of new aircraft and tank technologies,,which give the advantage to the attacker,,make the Blitzkrieg doctrine very credible,and thus create the possibility of war in Europe.,So military technologies,can influence the course of the world,,can make or break world peace --,and there lies the issue with cyber weapons. 
 The first issue:,Imagine a potential enemy announcing,they're building a cyberwar unit,,but only for their country's defense.,Okay, but what distinguishes it,from an offensive unit?,It gets even more complicated,when the doctrines of use become ambiguous.,Just 3 years ago, both the U.S. and France,were saying they were investing militarily in cyberspace,,strictly to defend their IT systems.,But today both countries say,the best defense is to attack.,And so, they're joining China,,whose doctrine of use for 15 years has been,both defensive and offensive. 
 The second issue:,Your country could be under cyberattack,with entire regions plunged into total darkness,,and you may not even know,who's attacking you.,Cyber weapons have this peculiar feature:,they can be used,without leaving traces.,This gives a tremendous advantage to the attacker,,because the defender,doesn't know who to fight back against.,And if the defender retaliates against the wrong adversary,,they risk making one more enemy,and ending up diplomatically isolated.,This issue isn't just theoretical. 
 In May 2007, Estonia was the victim of cyberattacks,,that damaged its communication,and banking systems.,Estonia accused Russia.,But NATO, though it defends Estonia,,reacted very prudently. Why?,Because NATO couldn't be 100\% sure,that the Kremlin was indeed behind these attacks.,So to sum up, on the one hand,,when a possible enemy announces,they're building a cyberwar unit,,you don't know whether it's for attack,or defense.,On the other hand,,we know that these weapons give an advantage to attacking. 
 In a major article published in 1978,,Professor Robert Jervis of Columbia University in New York,described a model to understand,how conflicts could arise.,In this context,,when you don't know if the potential enemy,is preparing for defense or attack,,and if the weapons give an advantage to attacking,,then this environment is,most likely to spark a conflict.,This is the environment that's being created,by cyber weapons today,,and historically it was the environment in Europe,at the onset of World War I.,So cyber weapons,are dangerous by nature,,but in addition, they're emerging,in a much more unstable environment. 
 If you remember the Cold War,,it was a very hard game,,but a stable one played only by two players,,which allowed for some coordination between the two superpowers.,Today we're moving to a multipolar world,in which coordination is much more complicated,,as we have seen at Copenhagen.,And this coordination may become even trickier,with the introduction of cyber weapons.,Why? Because no nation,knows for sure whether its neighbor,is about to attack.,So nations may live under the threat,of what Nobel Prize winner Thomas Schelling,called the "reciprocal fear of surprise attack,",as I don't know if my neighbor,is about to attack me or not --,I may never know --,so I might take the upper hand,and attack first. 
 Just last week,,in a New York Times article dated January 26, 2010,,it was revealed for the first time that,officials at the National Security Agency,were considering the possibility of preemptive attacks,in cases where the U.S. was about,to be cyberattacked.,And these preemptive attacks,might not just remain,in cyberspace.,In May 2009, General Kevin Chilton,,commander of the U.S. nuclear forces,,stated that in the event of cyberattacks against the U.S.,,all options would be on the table. 
 Cyber weapons do not replace,conventional or nuclear weapons --,they just add a new layer to the existing system of terror.,But in doing so, they also add their own risk,of triggering a conflict --,as we've just seen, a very important risk --,and a risk we may have to confront,with a collective security solution,which includes all of us:,European allies, NATO members,,our American friends and allies,,our other Western allies,,and maybe, by forcing their hand a little,,our Russian and Chinese partners. 
 The information technologies,Joël de Rosnay was talking about,,which were historically born from military research,,are today on the verge of developing,an offensive capability of destruction,,which could tomorrow, if we're not careful,,completely destroy world peace. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I am the daughter of a forger,,not just any forger ...,When you hear the word "forger," you often understand "mercenary.",You understand "forged currency," "forged pictures.",My father is no such man.,For 30 years of his life,,he made false papers --,never for himself, always for other people,,and to come to the aid of the persecuted and the oppressed.,Let me introduce him.,Here is my father at age 19.,It all began for him during World War II,,when at age 17 he found himself thrust,into a forged documents workshop.,He quickly became the false papers expert of the Resistance.,And it's not a banal story --,after the liberation he continued,to make false papers until the '70s. 
 When I was a child,I knew nothing about this, of course.,This is me in the middle making faces.,I grew up in the Paris suburbs,and I was the youngest of three children.,I had a "normal" dad like everybody else,,apart from the fact that he was 30 years older than ...,well, he was basically old enough to be my grandfather.,Anyway, he was a photographer and a street educator,,and he always taught us to obey the law very strictly.,And, of course, he never talked about his past life,when he was a forger. 
 There was, however, an incident I'm going to tell you about,,that perhaps could have led me suspect something.,I was in high school and got a bad grade,,a rare event for me,,so I decided to hide it from my parents.,In order to do that, I set out to forge their signature.,I started working on my mother's signature,,because my father's is absolutely impossible to forge.,So, I got working. I took some sheets of paper,and started practicing, practicing, practicing,,until I reached what I thought was a steady hand,,and went into action.,Later, while checking my school bag,,my mother got hold of my school assignment and immediately saw that the signature was forged.,She yelled at me like she never had before.,I went to hide in my bedroom, under the blankets,,and then I waited for my father to come back from work,with, one could say, much apprehension.,I heard him come in.,I remained under the blankets. He entered my room,,sat on the corner of the bed,,and he was silent, so I pulled the blanket from my head,,and when he saw me he started laughing.,He was laughing so hard, he could not stop and he was holding my assignment in his hand.,Then he said, "But really, Sarah, you could have worked harder! Can't you see it's really too small?",Indeed, it's rather small. 
 I was born in Algeria.,There I would hear people say my father was a "moudjahid",and that means "fighter.",Later on, in France, I loved eavesdropping on grownups' conversations,,and I would hear all sorts of stories about my father's previous life,,especially that he had "done" World War II,,that he had "done" the Algerian war.,And in my head I would be thinking that "doing" a war meant being a soldier.,But knowing my father, and how he kept saying that he was a pacifist and non-violent,,I found it very hard to picture him with a helmet and gun.,And indeed, I was very far from the mark. 
 One day, while my father was working on a file,for us to obtain French nationality,,I happened to see some documents,that caught my attention.,These are real!,These are mine, I was born an Argentinean.,But the document I happened to see,that would help us build a case for the authorities,was a document from the army,that thanked my father for his work,on behalf of the secret services.,And then, suddenly, I went "wow!",My father, a secret agent?,It was very James Bond.,I wanted to ask him questions, which he didn't answer.,And later, I told myself that,one day I would have to question him.,And then I became a mother and had a son,,and finally decided it was time -- that he absolutely had to talk to us.,I had become a mother,and he was celebrating his 77th birthday,,and suddenly I was very, very afraid.,I feared he'd go,and take his silences with him,,and take his secrets with him.,I managed to convince him that it was important for us,,but possibly also for other people,that he shared his story.,He decided to tell it to me,and I made a book,,from which I'm going to read you some excerpts later. 
 So, his story. My father was born in Argentina.,His parents were of Russian descent.,The whole family came to settle in France in the '30s.,His parents were Jewish, Russian and above all, very poor.,So at the age of 14 my father had to work.,And with his only diploma,,his primary education certificate,,he found himself working at a dyer - dry cleaner.,That's where he discovered something totally magical,,and when he talks about it, it's fascinating --,it's the magic of dyeing chemistry.,During that time the war was happening,and his mother was killed when he was 15.,This coincided with the time when,he threw himself body and soul into chemistry,because it was the only consolation for his sadness.,All day he would ask many questions to his boss,to learn, to accumulate more and more knowledge,,and at night, when no one was looking,,he'd put his experience to practice.,He was mostly interested in ink bleaching. 
 All this to tell you,that if my father became a forger, actually,,it was almost by accident.,His family was Jewish, so they were hounded.,Finally they were all arrested and taken to the Drancy camp,and they managed to get out at the last minute thanks to their Argentinean papers.,Well, they were out,,but they were always in danger. The big "Jew" stamp was still on their papers.,It was my grandfather who decided they needed false documents.,My father had been instilled with such respect for the law,that although he was being persecuted,,he'd never thought of false papers.,But it was he who went to meet a man from the Resistance. 
 In those times documents had hard covers,,they were filled in by hand,,and they stated your job.,In order to survive, he needed,to be working. He asked the man,to write "dyer.",Suddenly the man looked very, very interested.,As a "dyer," do you know how to bleach ink marks?,Of course he knew.,And suddenly the man started explaining that,actually the whole Resistance had a huge problem:,even the top experts,could not manage to bleach an ink, called "indelible,",the "Waterman" blue ink.,And my father immediately replied that he knew exactly,how to bleach it.,Now, of course, the man was very impressed with this young man of 17,who could immediately give him the formula, so he recruited him.,And actually, without knowing it, my father had invented something,we can find in every schoolchild's pencil case:,the so-called "correction pen.",(Applause) 
 But it was only the beginning.,That's my father.,As soon as he got to the lab,,even though he was the youngest,,he immediately saw that there was a problem with the making of forged documents.,All the movements stopped at falsifying.,But demand was ever-growing,and it was difficult to tamper with existing documents.,He told himself it was necessary to make them from scratch.,He started a press. He started photoengraving.,He started making rubber stamps.,He started inventing all kind of things --,with some materials he invented a centrifuge using a bicycle wheel.,Anyway, he had to do all this,because he was completely obsessed with output.,He had made a simple calculation:,In one hour he could make 30 forged documents.,If he slept one hour, 30 people would die. 
 This sense of,responsibility for other people's lives when he was just 17 --,and also his guilt for being a survivor,,since he had escaped the camp when his friends had not --,stayed with him all his life.,And this is maybe what explains why, for 30 years,,he continued to make false papers,at the expense of all kinds of sacrifices.,I'd like to talk about those sacrifices,,because there were many.,There were obviously financial sacrifices,because he always refused to be paid.,To him, being paid would have meant being a mercenary.,If he had accepted payment,,he wouldn't be able to say "yes" or "no",depending on what he deemed a just or unjust cause.,So he was a photographer by day,,and a forger by night for 30 years.,He was broke all of the time. 
 Then there were the emotional sacrifices:,How can one live with a woman while having so many secrets?,How can one explain what one does at night in the lab, every single night?,Of course, there was another kind of sacrifice,involving his family that I understood much later.,One day my father introduced me to my sister.,He also explained to me that I had a brother, too,,and the first time I saw them I must have been three or four,,and they were 30 years older than me.,They are both in their sixties now. 
 In order to write the book,,I asked my sister questions. I wanted to know who my father was,,who was the father she had known.,She explained that the father that she'd had,would tell them he'd come and pick them up on Sunday to go for a walk.,They would get all dressed up and wait for him,,but he would almost never come.,He'd say, "I'll call." He wouldn't call.,And then he would not come.,Then one day he totally disappeared.,Time passed,,and they thought he had surely forgotten them,,at first.,Then as time passed,,at the end of almost two years, they thought,,"Well, perhaps our father has died.",And then I understood,that asking my father so many questions,was stirring up a whole past he probably didn't feel like talking about,because it was painful.,And while my half brother and sister thought they'd been abandoned,,orphaned,,my father was making false papers.,And if he did not tell them, it was of course to protect them. 
 After the liberation he made false papers,to allow the survivors of concentration camps to immigrate to Palestine,before the creation of Israel.,And then, as he was a staunch anti-colonialist,,he made false papers for Algerians during the Algerian war.,After the Algerian war,,at the heart of the international resistance movements,,his name circulated,and the whole world came knocking at his door.,In Africa there were countries fighting for their independence:,Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Angola.,And then my father connected with Nelson Mandela's anti-apartheid party.,He made false papers for persecuted black South Africans. 
 There was also Latin America.,My father helped those who resisted dictatorships,in the Dominican Republic, Haiti,,and then it was the turn of Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, El Salvador, Nicaragua,,Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, Chile and Mexico.,Then there was the Vietnam War.,My father made false papers for the American deserters,who did not wish to take up arms against the Vietnamese.,Europe was not spared either.,My father made false papers for the dissidents,against Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal,,against the colonels' dictatorship in Greece,,and even in France.,There, just once, it happened in May of 1968.,My father watched, benevolently, of course,,the demonstrations of the month of May,,but his heart was elsewhere, and so was his time,because he had over 15 countries to serve. 
 Once, though, he agreed to make false papers,for someone you might recognize.,(Laughter),He was much younger in those days,,and my father agreed to make false papers,to enable him to come back and speak at a meeting.,He told me that those false papers were the most media-relevant,and the least useful he'd had to make in all his life.,But, he agreed to do it,,even though Daniel Cohn-Bendit's life was not in danger,,just because,it was a good opportunity,to mock the authorities,,and to show them that there's nothing more porous than borders --,and that ideas have no borders. 
 All my childhood,,while my friends' dads would tell them Grimm's fairy tales,,my father would tell me stories about very unassuming heroes,with unshakeable utopias,who managed to make miracles.,And those heroes did not need an army behind them.,Anyhow, nobody would have followed them,,except for a handful [of] men and women of conviction and courage.,I understood much later,that actually it was his own story my father would tell me to get me to sleep.,I asked him whether, considering the sacrifices he had to make,,he ever had any regrets.,He said no.,He told me that he would have been unable,to witness or submit to injustice without doing anything.,He was persuaded, and he's still convinced,that another world is possible --,a world where no one would ever need a forger.,He's still dreaming about it.,My father,is here in the room today.,His name is Adolfo Kaminsky and I'm going to ask him to stand up.,(Applause),Thank you.I am a PhD student.,And that means I have a question:,How can we make digital content graspable?,Because you see, on the one hand,nthere is the digital world,and no question, many thingsnare happening there right now.,And for us humans, it's not quitenmaterial, it's not really there --,it's virtual.,On the other hand,,we're humans, we live in a physical world.,It's rich, it tastes good,nit feels good, it smells good.,So the question is:,How do we get the stuff overnfrom the digital into the physical?,That's my question. 
 If you look at the iPhone with its touch,and the Wii with its bodily activity,,you can see the tendency;nit's getting physical.,The question is: What's next?,Now, I have three optionsnthat I would like to show you. 
 The first one is mass.,As humans, we are sensitivento where an object in our hand is heavy.,So could we use that in mobile phones?,Let me show younthe weight-shifting mobile.,It is a mobile phone-shaped box,that has an iron weight inside,nwhich we can move around,,and you can feel where it's heavy.,We shift the gravitational center of it.,For example, we can augmentndigital content with physical mass.,So you move around the contentnon the display,,but you can also feel where it isnjust from the weight of the device. 
 Another thing it's good for is navigation.,It can guide you around in a city.,It can tell you by its weight,,"OK, move right. Walk ahead.nMake a left here.",And the good thing about that is,,you don't have to looknat the device all the time;,you have your eyes free to see the city. 
 Now, mass is the first thing --,the second thing, that's shape.,We're also sensitive to the shapenof objects we have in our hands.,So if I download an e-booknand it has 20 pages --,well, they could be thin, right?,But if it has 500 pages,nI want to feel that "Harry Potter" --,it's thick. 
 (Laughter) 
 So let me show younthe shape-changing mobile.,Again, it's a mobile phone-shaped box,,and this one can change its shape.,We can play with the shape itself.,For example, it can be thinnin your pocket,,which we of course want it to be.,But then if you hold it in your hand,nit can lean towards you, be thick.,It's like tapered to the downside.,If you change the grasp,nit can adjust to that.,It's also useful if you want to put itndown on your nightstand,to watch a movie or use as an alarm clock.,It stands.,It's fairly simple. 
 Another thing is,,sometimes we watch thingsnon a mobile phone,that are bigger than the phone itself.,In that case -- like here, there's an app,that's bigger than the phone's screen --,the shape of the phone could tell you,,"OK, off the screen, right here,nthere is more content.,You can't see it, but it's there.",And you can feel it,nbecause it's thicker at that edge. 
 The shape is the second thing.,The third thing operatesnon a different level.,As humans, we are social, we are empathic,,and that's great.,Wouldn't that be a way to makenmobile phones more intuitive?,Think of a hamster in the pocket.,Well, I can feel it, it's doing all right.nI don't have to check it. 
 (Laughter) 
 Let me show you the living mobile phone.,So, once again, a mobile phone-shaped box.,But this one, it hasna breath and a heartbeat,,and it feels very organic. 
 (Laughter) 
 And you can tell, it's relaxed right now.,Oh, now -- missed call, a new call,,new girlfriend, maybe -- very exciting. 
 (Laughter) 
 How do we calm it down?,You give it a pat behind the ears,,and everything is all right again.,That's very intuitive,nand that's what we want.,So what we have seen are three waysnto make the digital graspable for us.,And I think making it physicalnis a good way to do that.,What's behind that is a postulation,,namely, not that humans should getnmuch more technical in the future;,rather than that, technology,na bit more human. 
 (Applause)If I can leave you with one big idea today,,it's that the whole of the data,in which we consume,is greater that the sum of the parts,,and instead of thinking about information overload,,what I'd like you to think about is how,we can use information so that patterns pop,and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible. 
 So what we're looking at right here is a typical mortality chart,organized by age.,This tool that I'm using here is a little experiment.,It's called Pivot, and with Pivot what I can do,is I can choose to filter in one particular cause of deaths -- say, accidents.,And, right away, I see there's a different pattern that emerges.,This is because, in the mid-area here,,people are at their most active,,and over here they're at their most frail.,We can step back out again,and then reorganize the data by cause of death,,seeing that circulatory diseases and cancer,are the usual suspects, but not for everyone.,If we go ahead and we filter by age --,say 40 years or less --,we see that accidents are actually,the greatest cause that people have to be worried about.,And if you drill into that, it's especially the case for men. 
 So you get the idea,that viewing information, viewing data in this way,,is a lot like swimming,in a living information info-graphic.,And if we can do this for raw data,,why not do it for content as well?,So what we have right here,is the cover of every single Sports Illustrated,ever produced.,It's all here; it's all on the web.,You can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk.,With Pivot, you can drill into a decade.,You can drill into a particular year.,You can jump right into a specific issue.,So I'm looking at this; I see the athletes,that have appeared in this issue, the sports.,I'm a Lance Armstrong fan, so I'll go ahead and I'll click on that,,which reveals, for me, all the issues,in which Lance Armstrong's been a part of. 
 (Applause) 
 Now, if I want to just kind of take a peek at these,,I might think,,"Well, what about taking a look at all of cycling?",So I can step back, and expand on that.,And I see Greg LeMond now.,And so you get the idea that when you,navigate over information this way --,going narrower, broader,,backing in, backing out --,you're not searching, you're not browsing.,You're doing something that's actually a little bit different.,It's in between, and we think it changes,the way information can be used. 
 So I want to extrapolate on this idea a bit,with something that's a little bit crazy.,What we're done here is we've taken every single Wikipedia page,and we reduced it down to a little summary.,So the summary consists of just a little synopsis,and an icon to indicate the topical area that it comes from.,I'm only showing the top 500,most popular Wikipedia pages right here.,But even in this limited view,,we can do a lot of things.,Right away, we get a sense of what are the topical domains,that are most popular on Wikipedia.,I'm going to go ahead and select government.,Now, having selected government,,I can now see that the Wikipedia categories,that most frequently correspond to that,are Time magazine People of the Year.,So this is really important because this is an insight,that was not contained within any one Wikipedia page.,It's only possible to see that insight,when you step back and look at all of them. 
 Looking at one of these particular summaries,,I can then drill into the concept of,Time magazine Person of the Year,,bringing up all of them.,So looking at these people,,I can see that the majority come from government;,some have come from natural sciences;,some, fewer still, have come from business --,there's my boss --,and one has come from music.,And interestingly enough,,Bono is also a TED Prize winner.,So we can go, jump, and take a look at all the TED Prize winners.,So you see, we're navigating the web for the first time,as if it's actually a web, not from page-to-page,,but at a higher level of abstraction. 
 And so I want to show you one other thing,that may catch you a little bit by surprise.,I'm just showing the New York Times website here.,So Pivot, this application --,I don't want to call it a browser; it's really not a browser,,but you can view web pages with it --,and we bring that zoomable technology,to every single web page like this.,So I can step back,,pop right back into a specific section.,Now the reason why this is important is because,,by virtue of just viewing web pages in this way,,I can look at my entire browsing history,in the exact same way.,So I can drill into what I've done,over specific time frames.,Here, in fact, is the state,of all the demo that I just gave.,And I can sort of replay some stuff that I was looking at earlier today.,And, if I want to step back and look at everything,,I can slice and dice my history,,perhaps by my search history --,here, I was doing some nepotistic searching,,looking for Bing, over here for Live Labs Pivot.,And from these, I can drill into the web page,and just launch them again.,It's one metaphor repurposed multiple times,,and in each case it makes the whole greater,than the sum of the parts with the data. 
 So right now, in this world,,we think about data as being this curse.,We talk about the curse of information overload.,We talk about drowning in data.,What if we can actually turn that upside down,and turn the web upside down,,so that instead of navigating from one thing to the next,,we get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things,,and then being able to see the patterns,that were otherwise hidden?,If we can do that, then instead of being trapped in data,,we might actually extract information.,And, instead of dealing just with information,,we can tease out knowledge.,And if we get the knowledge, then maybe even there's wisdom to be found. 
 So with that, I thank you. 
 (Applause)I only have three minutes,so I'm going to have to talk fast, and it will,use up your spare mental cycles, so multitasking may be hard.,So, 27 years ago I got a traffic ticket,that got me thinking.,I've had some time to think it over.,And energy efficiency is more than just,about the vehicle --,it's also about the road. 
 Road design makes a difference, particularly intersections,,of which there are two types: signalized,and unsignalized, which means stop signs.,Fifty percent of crashes happen at intersections.,Roundabouts are much better.,A study of 24 intersections,has found crashes drop 40 percent,from when you convert a traffic light into a roundabout.,Injury crashes have dropped 76 percent,,fatal crashes down 90 percent.,But that's just safety.,What about time and gas?,So, traffic keeps flowing, so that means less braking,,which means less accelerating, less gas and less pollution,,less time wasted,,and that partly accounts for Europe's better efficiency,than we have in the United States. 
 So, unsignalized intersections,,meaning stop signs, they save many lives,,but there's an excessive proliferation of them.,Small roundabouts are starting to appear.,This is one in my neighborhood. And they are,much better -- better than traffic lights, better than four-way stop signs.,They're expensive to install,,but they are more expensive not to. So, we should look at that. 
 But they are not applicable in all situations.,So, take, for example, the three-way intersection.,So, it's logical that you'd have one there,,on the minor road entering the major.,But the other two are somewhat questionable.,So, here's one. There's another one which I studied.,Cars rarely appear on that third road. 
 And so, the question is, what does that cost us?,That intersection I looked at had about 3,000,cars per day in each direction,,and so that's two ounces of gas to accelerate out of.,That's five cents each, and times 3,000 cars per day,,that's $51,000 per year.,That's just the gasoline cost. There is also pollution,,wear on the car, and time.,What's that time worth?,Well, at 10 seconds per 3,000 cars,,that's 8.3 hours per day. The average wage in the U.S.,is $20 an hour. That is 60,000 per year.,Add that together with the gas, and it's $112,000 per year,,just for that sign in each direction. 
 Discount that back to the present, at five percent:,over two million dollars,for a stop sign, in each direction.,Now, if you look at what that adjacent property is worth,,you could actually buy the property,,cut down the shrubbery to improve the sight line,,and then sell it off again.,And you'd still come out ahead.,So, it makes one wonder, "Why is it there?",I mean, why is there that stop sign in each direction?,Because it is saving lives. So, is there a better way to accomplish that goal? 
 The answer is to enable cars,to come in from that side road safely.,Because there are a lot of people who might live up there,and if they're waiting forever a long queue could form,because the cars aren't slowing down on the main road.,Can that be accomplished with existing signs?,So, there is a long history of stop signs and yield signs.,Stop signs were invented in 1915,,yield signs in 1950. But that's all we got. 
 So, why not use a yield sign?,Well the meaning of yield is: You must yield the right-of-way.,That means that if there are five cars waiting, you have to wait,till they all go, then you go. It lacks the notion,of alternating, or taking turns,,and it's always on the minor road,,allowing the major one to have primacy.,So, it's hard to create a new meaning for the existing sign.,You couldn't suddenly tell everyone, "OK, remember,what you used to do at yield signs? Now do something different.",That would not work. 
 So, what the world needs now,is a new type of sign.,(Applause),So, you'd have a little instruction below it,,you know, for those who didn't see the public service announcements.,And it merges the stop sign and yield signs.,It's kind of shaped like a T, as in taking turns.,And uncertainty results in caution.,When people come to an unfamiliar situation they don't know how to deal with,they slow down. 
 So, now that you are all "Road Scholars" ...,(Laughter),don't wait for that sign to be adopted, these things don't change quickly.,But you all are members of communities,,and you can exercise your community influence,to create more sensible traffic flows.,And you can have more impact on the environment,just getting your neighborhood to change these things,than by changing your vehicle. Thank you very much.,(Applause)Illegal wildlife trade in Brazil,is one of the major threats against our fauna,,especially birds,,and mainly to supply the pet market,with thousands of animals taken from nature every month,,and transported far from their origins,,to be sold mainly in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. 
 It is estimated that,all kinds of illegal wildlife trade in Brazil,withdraw from nature,almost 38 million animals every year,,a business worth almost two billion dollars.,The police intercepts,these huge cargos with live animals,,intended to supply the pet market,,or they seize the animals directly from the people's houses,,and this is how we end up, every month,,with thousands of seized animals. 
 And for us to understand what happens with them,,we're going to follow Brad.,In the eyes of many people,,after the animals are seized,,they say, "Yay, justice has been served.,The good guys arrived,,took the cute, mistreated animals,from the hands of the evil traffickers,,and everyone lived happily ever after.",But did they? Actually, no,,and this is where many of our problems begin.,Because we have to figure out,what to do with all these animals. 
 In Brazil, they are usually first sent,to governmental triage facilities,,in which most of the cases,,the conditions are as bad as,with the traffickers.,In 2002, these centers received,45,000 animals,,of which 37,000 were birds.,And the police estimates that we seize,only five percent of what's being trafficked.,Some lucky ones -- and among them, Brad --,go to serious rehabilitation centers after that.,And in these places they are cared for.,They train their flying,,they learn how to recognize the food they will find in nature,,and they are able to socialize,with others from the same species.,(Laughter) 
 But then what?,The Brazil Ornithological Society --,so now we're talking only birds --,claims that we have too little knowledge,about the species in nature.,Therefore, it would be too risky,to release these animals,,both for the released and for the natural populations.,They also claim that we spend too many resources,in their rehabilitation.,Following this argument,,they suggest that all the birds,seized from non-threatened species,should be euthanized.,However, this would mean having killed,26,267 birds,,only in the state of São Paulo, only in 2006. 
 But, some researchers, myself included --,some NGOs and some people from the Brazilian government --,believe there is an alternative.,We think that if and when the animals meet,certain criteria concerning their health,,behavior, inferred origin,and whatever we know about the natural populations,,then technically responsible releases are possible,,both for the well-being of the individual,,and for the conservation of the species and their ecosystems,,because we will be returning genes for these populations --,which could be important for them,in facing environmental challenges --,and also we could be returning,potential seed dispersers, predators, preys, etc. 
 All of these were released by us.,On the top, the turtles are just enjoying freedom.,(Laughter),On the middle,,this guy nested a couple of weeks after the release.,And on the bottom, my personal favorite,,the little male over there,,four hours after his release,he was together with a wild female.,So, this is not new, people have been,doing this around the world.,But it's still a big issue in Brazil.,We believe we have performed,responsible releases.,We've registered released animals mating in nature,and having chicks.,So, these genes are indeed going back to the populations. 
 However this is still a minority,for the very lack of knowledge.,So, I say, "Let's study more, let's shed light on this issue,,let's do whatever we can.",I'm devoting my career to that.,And I'm here to urge each and every one of you,to do whatever is in your reach:,Talk to your neighbor, teach your children,,make sure your pet is from a legal breeder.,We need to act, and act now,,before these ones are the only ones left.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)I'm going to talk to you today about my work on suspended animation.,Now, usually when I mention suspended animation,,people will flash me the Vulcan sign and laugh.,But now, I'm not talking about gorking people out,to fly to Mars or even Pandora,,as much fun as that may be.,I'm talking about,the concept of using suspended animation,to help people out in trauma. 
 So what do I mean,when I say "suspended animation"?,It is the process by which,animals de-animate,,appear dead,and then can wake up again without being harmed.,OK, so here is the sort of big idea:,If you look out at nature,,you find that,as you tend to see suspended animation,,you tend to see immortality.,And so, what I'm going to tell you about,is a way to tell a person who's in trauma --,find a way to de-animate them a bit,so they're a little more immortal,when they have that heart attack. 
 An example of an organism or two,that happens to be quite immortal,would be plant seeds,or bacterial spores.,These creatures are,some of the most immortal life forms on our planet,,and they tend to spend most of their time,in suspended animation.,Bacterial spores are thought now by scientists,to exist as individual cells,that are alive, but in suspended animation,for as long as 250 million years.,To suggest that this all, sort of, about little, tiny creatures,,I want to bring it close to home.,In the immortal germ line,of human beings --,that is, the eggs that sit in the ovaries --,they actually sit there in a state of suspended animation,for up to 50 years in the life of each woman. 
 So then there's also my favorite example,of suspended animation.,This is Sea-Monkeys.,Those of you with children,,you know about them.,You go to the pet store or the toy store,,and you can buy these things.,You just open the bag, and you just dump them,into the plastic aquarium,,and in about a week or so, you'll have little shrimps swimming around.,Well, I wasn't so interested in the swimming.,I was interested in what was going on in the bag,,the bag on the toy store shelf,where those shrimp sat,in suspended animation indefinitely.,So these ideas of suspended animation,are not just about cells and weird, little organisms. 
 Occasionally, human beings,are briefly de-animated,,and the stories of people who are briefly de-animated,that interest me the most,are those having to do with the cold.,Ten years ago, there was a skier in Norway,that was trapped in an icy waterfall,,and she was there for two hours before they extracted her.,She was extremely cold,,and she had no heartbeat --,for all intents and purposes she was dead, frozen.,Seven hours later,,still without a heartbeat,,they brought her back to life, and she went on to be,the head radiologist,in the hospital that treated her. 
 A couple of years later --,so I get really excited about these things --,about a couple of years later,,there was a 13-month-old, she was from Canada.,Her father had gone out in the wintertime; he was working night shift,,and she followed him outside in nothing but a diaper.,And they found her hours later,,frozen, lifeless,,and they brought her back to life. 
 There was a 65-year-old woman,in Duluth, Minnesota last year,that was found frozen and without a pulse,in her front yard one morning in the winter,,and they brought her back to life.,The next day, she was doing so well, they wanted to run tests on her.,She got cranky and just went home.,(Laughter) 
 So, these are miracles, right?,These are truly miraculous things that happen.,Doctors have a saying,that, in fact, "You're not dead until you're warm and dead.",And it's true. It's true.,In the New England Journal of Medicine,,there was a study published that showed,that with appropriate rewarming,,people who had suffered without a heartbeat for three hours,could be brought back to life without any neurologic problems.,That's over 50 percent.,So what I was trying to do is think of a way,that we could study,suspended animation,to think about a way,to reproduce, maybe,,what happened to the skier. 
 Well, I have to tell you something very odd,,and that is that being exposed to low oxygen,does not always kill.,So, in this room, there's 20 percent oxygen or so,,and if we reduce the oxygen concentration,,we will all be dead.,And, in fact, the animals we were working with in the lab --,these little garden worms, nematodes --,they were also dead when we exposed them to low oxygen.,And here's the thing that should freak you out.,And that is that, when we lower the oxygen concentration further,by 100 times, to 10 parts per million,,they were not dead,,they were in suspended animation,,and we could bring them back to life without any harm.,And this precise oxygen concentration,,10 parts per million,,that caused suspended animation,,is conserved.,We can see it in a variety of different organisms.,One of the creatures we see it in,is a fish.,And we can turn its heartbeat on and off by going in and out,of suspended animation like you would a light switch. 
 So this was pretty shocking to me,,that we could do this.,And so I was wondering, when we were trying,to reproduce the work with the skier,,that we noticed that, of course,,she had no oxygen consumption,,and so maybe she was in a similar state of suspended animation.,But, of course, she was also extremely cold.,So we wondered what would happen,if we took our suspended animals and exposed them to the cold.,And so, what we found out,was that, if you take animals,that are animated like you and I,,and you make them cold -- that is, these were the garden worms --,now they're dead.,But if you have them in suspended animation,,and move them into the cold, they're all alive.,And there's the very important thing there:,If you want to survive the cold,,you ought to be suspended. Right?,It's a really good thing. 
 And so, we were thinking about that,,about this relationship between these things,,and thinking about whether or not that's what happened to the skier.,And so we wondered: Might there be some agent,that is in us, something that we make ourselves,,that we might be able to regulate our own metabolic flexibility,in such a way as to be able to survive,when we got extremely cold, and might otherwise pass away?,I thought it might be interesting to sort of hunt for such things.,You know? 
 I should mention briefly here,that physiology textbooks that you can read about,will tell you that this is a kind of heretical thing to suggest.,We have, from the time we are slapped on the butt,until we take our last dying breath --,that's when we're newborn to when we're dead --,we cannot reduce our metabolic rate,below what's called a standard,,or basal metabolic rate.,But I knew that there were examples,of creatures, also mammals,,that do reduce their metabolic rate,such as ground squirrels and bears,,they reduce their metabolic rate,in the wintertime when they hibernate.,So I wondered: Might we be able to find some agent or trigger,that might induce such a state in us? 
 And so, we went looking for such things.,And this was a period of time when we failed tremendously.,Ken Robinson is here. He talked about the glories of failure.,Well, we had a lot of them.,We tried many different chemicals and agents,,and we failed over and over again.,So, one time, I was at home,watching television on the couch,while my wife was putting our child to bed,,and I was watching a television show.,It was a television show --,it was a NOVA show on PBS --,about caves in New Mexico.,And this particular cave was Lechuguilla,,and this cave is incredibly toxic to humans.,The researchers had to suit up just to enter it.,It's filled with this toxic gas,,hydrogen sulfide.,Now, hydrogen sulfide is curiously present in us.,We make it ourselves.,The highest concentration is in our brains.,Yet, it was used,as a chemical warfare agent in World War I.,It's an extraordinarily toxic thing.,In fact, in chemical accidents,,hydrogen sulfide is known to --,if you breathe too much of it, you collapse to the ground,,you appear dead,,but if you were brought out into room air, you can be reanimated without harm,,if they do that quickly. 
 So, I thought, "Wow, I have to get some of this.",(Laughter),Now, it's post-9/11 America,,and when you go into the research institute,,and you say, "Hi.,I'd like to buy some concentrated,,compressed gas cylinders,of a lethal gas,because I have these ideas, see,,about wanting to suspend people.,It's really going to be OK.",So that's kind of a tough day,,but I said, "There really is,some basis for thinking why you might want to do this.",As I said, this agent is in us,,and, in fact, here's a curious thing,,it binds to the very place inside of your cells,where oxygen binds, and where you burn it,,and that you do this burning to live.,And so we thought, like in a game of musical chairs,,might we be able to give a person,some hydrogen sulfide,,and might it be able to occupy that place,like in a game of musical chairs where oxygen might bind?,And because you can't bind the oxygen,,maybe you wouldn't consume it,,and then maybe it would reduce your demand for oxygen.,I mean, who knows? 
 So -- (Laughter),So, there's the bit about the dopamine,and being a little bit, what do you call it, delusional,,and you might suggest that was it.,And so, we wanted to find out,might we be able to use,hydrogen sulfide in the presence of cold,,and we wanted to see whether we could,reproduce this skier in a mammal.,Now, mammals are warm-blooded creatures,,and when we get cold, we shake and we shiver, right?,We try to keep our core temperature at 37 degrees,by actually burning more oxygen.,So, it was interesting for us,when we applied hydrogen sulfide,to a mouse when it was also cold,because what happened is the core temperature,of the mouse got cold.,It stopped moving.,It appeared dead.,Its oxygen consumption rate,fell by tenfold.,And here's the really important point.,I told you hydrogen sulfide is in us.,It's rapidly metabolized,,and all you have to do after six hours of being,in this state of de-animation,is simply put the thing out in room air,,and it warms up, and it's none the worse for wear. 
 Now, this was cosmic.,Really. Because we had found a way,to de-animate a mammal,,and it didn't hurt it.,Now, we'd found a way to reduce,its oxygen consumption,to rock-bottom levels, and it was fine.,Now, in this state of de-animation,,it could not go out dancing,,but it was not dead,,and it was not harmed.,So we started to think: Is this the agent,that might have been present in the skier,,and might have she had more of it than someone else,,and might that have been able to reduce,her demand for oxygen,before she got so cold that,she otherwise would have died,,as we found out with our worm experiments? 
 So, we wondered:,Can we do anything useful,with this capacity to,control metabolic flexibility?,And one of the things we wondered --,I'm sure some of you out there are economists,,and you know all about supply and demand.,And when supply is equal to demand,,everything's fine,,but when supply falls,,in this case of oxygen,,and demand stays high, you're dead.,So, what I just told you,is we can now reduce demand.,We ought to be able to lower supply,to unprecedented low levels without killing the animal.,And with money we got from DARPA,,we could show just that.,If you give mice hydrogen sulfide,,you can lower their demand for oxygen,,and you can put them into oxygen concentrations,that are as low as 5,000 feet above the top of Mt. Everest,,and they can sit there for hours, and there's no problem.,Well this was really cool.,We also found out that we could subject animals,to otherwise lethal blood loss, and we could save them,if we gave them hydrogen sulfide. 
 So these proof of concept experiments,led me to say "I should found a company,,and we should take this out to a wider playing field.",I founded a company called Ikaria,with others' help.,And this company, the first thing it did,was make a liquid formulation of hydrogen sulfide,an injectable form that we could put in,and send it out to physician scientists all over the world,who work on models of critical care medicine,,and the results are incredibly positive. 
 In one model of heart attack,,animals given hydrogen sulfide,showed a 70 percent reduction in heart damage,compared to those who got the standard of care that,you and I would receive if we were to have a heart attack here today.,Same is true for organ failure,,when you have loss of function owing to poor perfusion of kidney, of liver,,acute respiratory distress syndrome,and damage suffered in cardiac-bypass surgery.,So, these are the thought leaders in trauma medicine,all over the world saying this is true,,so it seems that exposure to hydrogen sulfide,decreases damage that you receive,from being exposed to otherwise lethal-low oxygen. 
 And I should say that the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide,required to get this benefit,are low, incredibly low.,In fact, so low that physicians will not have to lower or dim,the metabolism of people much at all,to see the benefit I just mentioned,,which is a wonderful thing, if you're thinking about adopting this.,You don't want to be gorking people out,just to save them, it's really confusing.,(Laughter) 
 So, I want to say that we're in human trials.,Now, and so --,(Applause),Thank you. The Phase 1 safety studies are over,,and we're doing fine, we're now moved on.,We have to get to Phase 2 and Phase 3. It's going to take us a few years.,This has all moved very quickly,,and the mouse experiments,of hibernating mice happened in 2005;,the first human studies were done in 2008,,and we should know in a couple of years,whether it works or not.,And this all happened really quickly,because of a lot of help from a lot of people. 
 I want to mention that, first of all,,my wife, without whom this talk and my work would not be possible,,so thank you very much.,Also, the brilliant scientists who work at my lab,and also others on staff,,the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington --,wonderful place to work.,And also the wonderful scientists,and businesspeople at Ikaria.,One thing those people did out there,was take this technology of hydrogen sulfide,,which is this start-up company that's burning venture capital very quickly,,and they fused it with another company,that sells another toxic gas,that's more toxic than hydrogen sulfide,,and they give it to newborn babies who would otherwise die,from a failure to be able to oxygenate their tissues properly.,And this gas that is delivered in over,a thousand critical care hospitals worldwide,,now is approved, on label,,and saves thousands of babies a year,from certain death.,(Applause) 
 So it's really incredible,for me to be a part of this.,And I want to say that I think we're on the path,of understanding metabolic flexibility,in a fundamental way,,and that in the not too distant future,,an EMT might give an injection of hydrogen sulfide,,or some related compound,,to a person suffering severe injuries,,and that person might de-animate a bit,,they might become a little more immortal.,Their metabolism will fall,as though you were dimming a switch on a lamp at home.,And then, they will have the time, that will buy them the time,,to be transported to the hospital,to get the care they need.,And then, after they get that care --,like the mouse, like the skier,,like the 65-year-old woman --,they'll wake up.,A miracle?,We hope not, or maybe we just hope,to make miracles a little more common. 
 Thank you very much.,(Applause)(Music) 
 (Applause) 
 I'm Jon M. Chu. And I'm not a dancer,,I'm not a choreographer -- I'm actually a filmmaker, a storyteller.,I directed a movie two years ago,called "Step Up 2: The Streets.",Anybody? Anybody? Yeah!,During that movie I got to meet a ton of hip-hop dancers --,amazing, the best in the world --,and they brought me into a society, the sort of underground,street culture that blew my mind.,I mean, this is literally human beings,with super-human strength and abilities.,They could fly in the air. They could bend their elbow all the way back.,They could spin on their heads for 80 times in a row.,I'd never seen anything like that. 
 When I was growing up, my heroes were people like,Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Michael Jackson.,I grew up in a musical family.,(Laughter),And those guys, those were like, ultimate heroes.,Being a shy, little, skinny Asian kid growing up in the Silicon Valley,with low self-esteem, those guys made me believe in something bigger.,Those guys made me want to, like, "I'm going to do that,moonwalk at that bar mitzvah tonight for that girl." 
 (Applause) 
 And it seems like those dance heroes have disappeared,,sort of relegated to the background of pop stars and music videos.,But after seeing what I've seen,,the truth is, they have not disappeared at all.,They're here, getting better and better every day.,And dance has progressed.,It is insane what dance is right now.,Dance has never had a better friend than technology. 
 Online videos and social networking ...,dancers have created a whole global laboratory online,for dance, where kids in Japan are taking moves,from a YouTube video created in Detroit,,building on it within days and releasing a new video,,while teenagers in California are taking the Japanese video and remixing it,with a Philly flair to create a whole new dance style in itself.,And this is happening every day. 
 And from these bedrooms and living rooms and garages,,with cheap webcams,,lies the world's great dancers of tomorrow.,Our Fred Astaires, our Gene Kellys,our Michael Jacksons are right at our fingertips,,and may not have that opportunity, except for us. 
 So, we created the LXD,,sort of a -- the Legion of Extraordinary Dancers,,a justice league of dancers that believe,that dance can have a transformative effect on the world.,A living, breathing comic book series,,but unlike Spiderman and Iron Man,,these guys can actually do it.,And we're going to show you some today. So, let me introduce to you,,some of our heroes right now.,We got Madd Chadd,,Lil' C, Kid David and J Smooth.,Please be excited, have fun, yell, scream.,Ladies and gentlemen: The LXD. 
 (Applause) 
 (Video): Madd Chadd: When people first see me,,I get a lot of different reactions actually.,Sometimes you would think that maybe kids would enjoy it,,but sometimes they get a little freaked out.,And, I don't know, I kind of get a kick out of that a little bit. 
 (Music) 
 (Applause) 
 J Smooth: When I'm in the zone -- I'm dancing and free styling it --,I actually visually kind of picture,lines, and moving them.,I think of like, Transformers,,like how panels open and then they fold,,they fold in, and then you close that panel.,And then another thing opens,,you close that. 
 (Music) 
 (Applause) 
 Kid David: It's kind of like, honestly a lot of times,I don't really know what's going on,when I'm dancing.,Because at that point it's just really like, it's my body and the music.,It's not really a conscious decision,,"I'm going to do this next, I'm going to do this.",It's kind of like this other level,where you can't make choices anymore,,and it's just your body reacting to certain sounds in the music.,I got my name just because I was so young.,I was young when I started. I was younger than a lot of the people I was dancing with.,So, it was always like, they called me Kid David, because I was the kid. 
 (Music) 
 (Applause) 
 L'il C: I tell them to create a ball,,and then you just use that ball of energy.,And instead of throwing it out, people would think,that's a krump move, that's a krump move.,That's not a krump move. You're going to throw it out,,you throw it out, and you hold it.,And you let it go, and then right when you see the tail,,you grab it by the tail, then you bring it back in.,And you just got this piece of energy,and you just, you're manipulating it.,You know, you create power, then you tame it. 
 (Music) 
 (Applause) 
 (Music) 
 (Applause)Do you worry about what is going to kill you?,Heart disease, cancer,,a car accident?,Most of us worry about things we can't control,,like war, terrorism,,the tragic earthquake that just occurred in Haiti.,But what really threatens humanity?,A few years ago, Professor Vaclav Smil,tried to calculate the probability,of sudden disasters,large enough to change history.,He called these,,"massively fatal discontinuities,",meaning that they could kill,up to 100 million people,in the next 50 years.,He looked at the odds of another world war,,of a massive volcanic eruption,,even of an asteroid hitting the Earth.,But he placed the likelihood of one such event,above all others,at close to 100 percent,,and that is a severe flu pandemic.,Now, you might think of flu,as just a really bad cold,,but it can be a death sentence.,Every year, 36,000 people in the United States,die of seasonal flu.,In the developing world, the data is much sketchier,but the death toll is almost,certainly higher.,You know, the problem is if,this virus occasionally mutates,so dramatically,,it essentially is a new virus,and then we get a pandemic. 
 In 1918, a new virus appeared,that killed some 50 to 100 million people.,It spread like wildfire,and some died within hours of developing symptoms.,Are we safer today?,Well, we seem to have dodged,the deadly pandemic this year,that most of us feared,,but this threat could reappear at any time.,The good news is that,we're at a moment in time,when science, technology, globalization is converging,to create an unprecedented possibility:,the possibility to make history,by preventing infectious diseases,that still account for one-fifth of all deaths,and countless misery on Earth.,We can do this.,We're already preventing millions of deaths,with existing vaccines,,and if we get these to more people,,we can certainly save more lives.,But with new or better vaccines,for malaria, TB, HIV,,pneumonia, diarrhea, flu,,we could end suffering,that has been on the Earth since the beginning of time. 
 So, I'm here to trumpet vaccines for you.,But first, I have to explain why they're important,because vaccines, the power of them,,is really like a whisper.,When they work, they can make history,,but after a while,you can barely hear them.,Now, some of us are old enough,to have a small, circular scar on our arms,from an inoculation we received as children.,But when was the last time you worried about smallpox,,a disease that killed half a billion people last century,and no longer is with us?,Or polio? How many of you remember the iron lung?,We don't see scenes like this anymore,because of vaccines. 
 Now, it's interesting,because there are 30-odd diseases,that can be treated with vaccines now,,but we're still threatened by things like HIV and flu.,Why is that?,Well, here's the dirty little secret.,Until recently, we haven't had to know,exactly how a vaccine worked.,We knew they worked through old-fashioned trial and error.,You took a pathogen, you modified it,,you injected it into a person or an animal,and you saw what happened.,This worked well for most pathogens,,somewhat well for crafty bugs like flu,,but not at all for HIV,,for which humans have no natural immunity. 
 So let's explore how vaccines work.,They basically create a cache,of weapons for your immune system,which you can deploy when needed.,Now, when you get a viral infection,,what normally happens is it takes days or weeks,for your body to fight back,at full strength,,and that might be too late.,When you're pre-immunized,,what happens is you have forces in your body,pre-trained to recognize,and defeat specific foes.,So that's really how vaccines work.,Now, let's take a look at a video,that we're debuting at TED, for the first time,,on how an effective HIV vaccine might work. 
 (Music) 
 Narrator: A vaccine trains the body in advance,how to recognize and neutralize,a specific invader.,After HIV penetrates the body's mucosal barriers,,it infects immune cells to replicate.,The invader draws the attention,of the immune system's front-line troops.,Dendritic cells, or macrophages,,capture the virus and display pieces of it.,Memory cells generated by the HIV vaccine,are activated when they learn,HIV is present from the front-line troops.,These memory cells immediately deploy,the exact weapons needed.,Memory B cells turn into plasma cells,,which produce wave after wave,of the specific antibodies,that latch onto HIV,to prevent it from infecting cells,,while squadrons of killer T cells,seek out and destroy cells,that are already HIV infected.,The virus is defeated.,Without a vaccine,,these responses would have taken more than a week.,By that time, the battle against HIV,would already have been lost. 
 Seth Berkley: Really cool video, isn't it?,The antibodies you just saw in this video,,in action, are the ones that make most vaccines work.,So the real question then is:,How do we ensure that your body makes,the exact ones that we need to protect,against flu and HIV?,The principal challenge for both of these viruses,is that they're always changing.,So let's take a look at the flu virus.,In this rendering of the flu virus,,these different colored spikes are what it uses to infect you.,And also, what the antibodies use is a handle,to essentially grab and neutralize the virus.,When these mutate, they change their shape,,and the antibodies don't know what they're looking at anymore.,So that's why every year,you can catch a slightly different strain of flu.,It's also why in the spring,,we have to make a best guess,at which three strains are going to prevail the next year,,put those into a single vaccine,and rush those into production for the fall. 
 Even worse,,the most common influenza -- influenza A --,also infects animals,that live in close proximity to humans,,and they can recombine,in those particular animals.,In addition, wild aquatic birds,carry all known strains,of influenza.,So, you've got this situation:,In 2003,,we had an H5N1 virus,that jumped from birds into humans,in a few isolated cases,with an apparent mortality rate of 70 percent.,Now luckily, that particular virus,,although very scary at the time,,did not transmit from person to person,very easily.,This year's H1N1 threat,was actually a human, avian, swine mixture,that arose in Mexico.,It was easily transmitted,,but, luckily, was pretty mild.,And so, in a sense,,our luck is holding out,,but you know, another wild bird could fly over at anytime. 
 Now let's take a look at HIV.,As variable as flu is,,HIV makes flu,look like the Rock of Gibraltar.,The virus that causes AIDS,is the trickiest pathogen,scientists have ever confronted.,It mutates furiously,,it has decoys to evade the immune system,,it attacks the very cells that are trying to fight it,and it quickly hides itself,in your genome.,Here's a slide looking at,the genetic variation of flu,and comparing that to HIV,,a much wilder target.,In the video a moment ago,,you saw fleets of new viruses launching from infected cells.,Now realize that in a recently infected person,,there are millions of these ships;,each one is just slightly different.,Finding a weapon that recognizes,and sinks all of them,makes the job that much harder. 
 Now, in the 27 years since HIV,was identified as the cause of AIDS,,we've developed more drugs to treat HIV,than all other viruses put together.,These drugs aren't cures,,but they represent a huge triumph of science,because they take away the automatic death sentence,from a diagnosis of HIV,,at least for those who can access them.,The vaccine effort though is really quite different.,Large companies moved away from it,because they thought the science was so difficult,and vaccines were seen as poor business.,Many thought that it was just impossible to make an AIDS vaccine,,but today, evidence tells us otherwise. 
 In September,,we had surprising but exciting findings,from a clinical trial that took place in Thailand.,For the first time, we saw an AIDS vaccine work in humans --,albeit, quite modestly --,and that particular vaccine was made,almost a decade ago.,Newer concepts and early testing now,show even greater promise in the best of our animal models.,But in the past few months, researchers have also isolated,several new broadly neutralizing antibodies,from the blood of an HIV infected individual.,Now, what does this mean?,We saw earlier that HIV,is highly variable,,that a broad neutralizing antibody,latches on and disables,multiple variations of the virus.,If you take these and you put them,in the best of our monkey models,,they provide full protection from infection.,In addition, these researchers found,a new site on HIV,where the antibodies can grab onto,,and what's so special about this spot,is that it changes very little,as the virus mutates.,It's like, as many times,as the virus changes its clothes,,it's still wearing the same socks,,and now our job is to make sure,we get the body to really hate those socks. 
 So what we've got is a situation.,The Thai results tell us,we can make an AIDS vaccine,,and the antibody findings,tell us how we might do that.,This strategy, working backwards,from an antibody to create a vaccine candidate,,has never been done before in vaccine research.,It's called retro-vaccinology,,and its implications extend,way beyond that of just HIV.,So think of it this way.,We've got these new antibodies we've identified,,and we know that they latch onto many, many variations of the virus.,We know that they have to latch onto a specific part,,so if we can figure out the precise structure of that part,,present that through a vaccine,,what we hope is we can prompt,your immune system to make these matching antibodies.,And that would create,a universal HIV vaccine.,Now, it sounds easier than it is,because the structure actually looks more like,this blue antibody diagram,attached to its yellow binding site,,and as you can imagine, these three-dimensional structures,are much harder to work on.,And if you guys have ideas to help us solve this,,we'd love to hear about it. 
 But, you know, the research that has occurred from HIV now,has really helped with innovation with other diseases.,So for instance, a biotechnology company,has now found broadly neutralizing,antibodies to influenza,,as well as a new antibody target on the flu virus.,They're currently making a cocktail --,an antibody cocktail -- that can be used to treat,severe, overwhelming cases of flu.,In the longer term, what they can do,is use these tools of retro-vaccinology,to make a preventive flu vaccine.,Now, retro-vaccinology is just one technique,within the ambit of so-called rational vaccine design. 
 Let me give you another example.,We talked about before the H and N spikes,on the surface of the flu virus.,Notice these other, smaller protuberances.,These are largely hidden from the immune system.,Now it turns out that these spots,also don't change much when the virus mutates.,If you can cripple these with specific antibodies,,you could cripple all versions of the flu.,So far, animal tests indicate,that such a vaccine could prevent severe disease,,although you might get a mild case.,So if this works in humans, what we're talking about,is a universal flu vaccine,,one that doesn't need to change every year,and would remove the threat of death.,We really could think of flu, then,,as just a bad cold. 
 Of course, the best vaccine imaginable,is only valuable to the extent,we get it to everyone who needs it.,So to do that, we have to combine,smart vaccine design with smart production methods,and, of course, smart delivery methods.,So I want you to think back a few months ago.,In June, the World Health Organization,declared the first global,flu pandemic in 41 years.,The U.S. government promised,150 million doses of vaccine,by October 15th for the flu peak.,Vaccines were promised to developing countries.,Hundreds of millions of dollars were spent,and flowed to accelerating vaccine manufacturing.,So what happened? 
 Well, we first figured out,how to make flu vaccines, how to produce them,,in the early 1940s.,It was a slow, cumbersome process,that depended on chicken eggs,,millions of living chicken eggs.,Viruses only grow in living things,,and so it turned out that, for flu,,chicken eggs worked really well.,For most strains, you could get one to two doses,of vaccine per egg.,Luckily for us,,we live in an era of breathtaking,biomedical advances.,So today, we get our flu vaccines from ...,chicken eggs,,(Laughter),hundreds of millions of chicken eggs.,Almost nothing has changed.,The system is reliable,but the problem is you never know how well,a strain is going to grow.,This year's swine flu strain,grew very poorly in early production:,basically .6 doses per egg.,So, here's an alarming thought.,What if that wild bird flies by again?,You could see an avian strain,that would infect the poultry flocks,,and then we would have no eggs for our vaccines.,So, Dan [Barber], if you want,billions of chicken pellets,for your fish farm,,I know where to get them.,So right now, the world can produce,about 350 million doses,of flu vaccine for the three strains,,and we can up that to about 1.2 billion doses,if we want to target a single variant,like swine flu.,But this assumes that our factories are humming,because, in 2004,,the U.S. supply was cut in half,by contamination at one single plant.,And the process still takes,more than half a year. 
 So are we better prepared,than we were in 1918?,Well, with the new technologies emerging now,,I hope we can say definitively, "Yes.",Imagine we could produce enough flu vaccine,for everyone in the entire world,for less than half of what we're currently spending,now in the United States.,With a range of new technologies, we could.,Here's an example:,A company I'm engaged with has found,a specific piece of the H spike of flu,that sparks the immune system.,If you lop this off and attach it,to the tail of a different bacterium,,which creates a vigorous immune response,,they've created a very powerful flu fighter.,This vaccine is so small,it can be grown in a common bacteria, E. coli.,Now, as you know, bacteria reproduce quickly --,it's like making yogurt --,and so we could produce enough swine origin flu,for the entire world in a few factories, in a few weeks,,with no eggs,,for a fraction of the cost of current methods. 
 (Applause) 
 So here's a comparison of several of these new vaccine technologies.,And, aside from the radically increased production,and huge cost savings --,for example, the E. coli method I just talked about --,look at the time saved: this would be lives saved.,The developing world,,mostly left out of the current response,,sees the potential of these alternate technologies,and they're leapfrogging the West.,India, Mexico and others are already,making experimental flu vaccines,,and they may be the first place,we see these vaccines in use.,Because these technologies are so efficient,and relatively cheap,,billions of people can have access to lifesaving vaccines,if we can figure out how to deliver them. 
 Now think of where this leads us.,New infectious diseases,appear or reappear,every few years.,Some day, perhaps soon,,we'll have a virus that is going to threaten all of us.,Will we be quick enough to react,before millions die?,Luckily, this year's flu was relatively mild.,I say, "luckily" in part,because virtually no one in the developing world,was vaccinated.,So if we have the political and financial foresight,to sustain our investments,,we will master these and new tools of vaccinology,,and with these tools we can produce,enough vaccine for everyone at low cost,and ensure healthy productive lives.,No longer must flu have to kill half a million people a year.,No longer does AIDS,need to kill two million a year.,No longer do the poor and vulnerable,need to be threatened by infectious diseases,,or indeed, anybody.,Instead of having Vaclav Smil's,"massively fatal discontinuity" of life,,we can ensure,the continuity of life.,What the world needs now are these new vaccines,,and we can make it happen. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: Thank you.,(Applause),Thank you.,So, the science is changing.,In your mind, Seth -- I mean, you must dream about this --,what is the kind of time scale,on, let's start with HIV,,for a game-changing vaccine that's actually out there and usable? 
 SB: The game change can come at any time,,because the problem we have now is,we've shown we can get a vaccine to work in humans;,we just need a better one.,And with these types of antibodies, we know humans can make them.,So, if we can figure out how to do that,,then we have the vaccine,,and what's interesting is there already is,some evidence that we're beginning to crack that problem.,So, the challenge is full speed ahead. 
 CA: In your gut, do you think it's probably going to be at least another five years? 
 SB: You know, everybody says it's 10 years,,but it's been 10 years every 10 years.,So I hate to put a timeline,on scientific innovation,,but the investments that have occurred are now paying dividends. 
 CA: And that's the same with universal flu vaccine, the same kind of thing? 
 SB: I think flu is different. I think what happened with flu is,we've got a bunch -- I just showed some of this --,a bunch of really cool and useful technologies that are ready to go now.,They look good. The problem has been that,,what we did is we invested in traditional technologies,because that's what we were comfortable with.,You also can use adjuvants, which are chemicals you mix.,That's what Europe is doing, so we could have diluted out,our supply of flu and made more available,,but, going back to what Michael Specter said,,the anti-vaccine crowd didn't really want that to happen. 
 CA: And malaria's even further behind? 
 SB: No, malaria, there is a candidate,that actually showed efficacy in an earlier trial,and is currently in phase three trials now.,It probably isn't the perfect vaccine, but it's moving along. 
 CA: Seth, most of us do work where every month,,we produce something;,we get that kind of gratification.,You've been slaving away at this for more than a decade,,and I salute you and your colleagues for what you do.,The world needs people like you. Thank you. 
 SB: Thank you. 
 (Applause)I was here four years ago,,and I remember, at the time,,that the talks weren't put online.,I think they were givennto TEDsters in a box,,a box set of DVDs,,which they put on their shelves,nwhere they are now. 
 (Laughter) 
 And actually, Chris called mena week after I'd given my talk, and said,,"We're going to start putting them online.nCan we put yours online?",And I said, "Sure." 
 And four years later,,it's been downloaded four million times.,So I suppose you could multiply thatnby 20 or something,to get the numbernof people who've seen it.,And, as Chris says, there isna hunger for videos of me. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Don't you feel? 
 (Laughter) 
 So, this whole eventnhas been an elaborate build-up,to me doing another onenfor you, so here it is. 
 (Laughter) 
 Al Gore spoke at the TED conferencenI spoke at four years ago,and talked about the climate crisis.,And I referenced thatnat the end of my last talk.,So I want to pick up from there,because I only had 18 minutes, frankly. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, as I was saying -- 
 (Laughter) 
 You see, he's right.,I mean, there is a majornclimate crisis, obviously,,and I think if people don't believe it,nthey should get out more. 
 (Laughter) 
 But I believe there isna second climate crisis,,which is as severe,,which has the same origins,,and that we have to deal withnwith the same urgency.,And you may say, by the way,,"Look, I'm good.,I have one climate crisis,nI don't really need the second one." 
 (Laughter) 
 But this is a crisis of,nnot natural resources --,though I believe that's true --,but a crisis of human resources. 
 I believe fundamentally,,as many speakers have saidnduring the past few days,,that we make very poor use of our talents.,Very many people gonthrough their whole lives,having no real sensenof what their talents may be,,or if they have any to speak of.,I meet all kinds of people,who don't thinknthey're really good at anything. 
 Actually, I kind of divide the worldninto two groups now.,Jeremy Bentham, the greatnutilitarian philosopher,,once spiked this argument.,He said, "There are two typesnof people in this world:,those who divide the world into two types,and those who do not." 
 (Laughter) 
 Well, I do. 
 (Laughter) 
 I meet all kinds of peoplenwho don't enjoy what they do.,They simply go through their livesngetting on with it.,They get no great pleasurenfrom what they do.,They endure it rather than enjoy it,,and wait for the weekend.,But I also meet people,who love what they donand couldn't imagine doing anything else.,If you said, "Don't do this anymore,",they'd wonder what you're talking about.,It isn't what they do, it's who they are.,They say, "But this is me, you know.,It would be foolish to abandon this,,because it speaksnto my most authentic self.",And it's not true of enough people.,In fact, on the contrary, I thinknit's still true of a minority of people.,And I think there are manynpossible explanations for it.,And high among them is education,,because education, in a way,,dislocates very many peoplenfrom their natural talents.,And human resourcesnare like natural resources;,they're often buried deep.,You have to go looking for them,,they're not just lying aroundnon the surface.,You have to create the circumstancesnwhere they show themselves.,And you might imagineneducation would be the way that happens,,but too often, it's not.,Every education system in the worldnis being reformed at the moment,and it's not enough.,Reform is no use anymore,,because that's simply improvingna broken model.,What we need --,and the word's been usednmany times in the past few days --,is not evolution,,but a revolution in education.,This has to be transformedninto something else. 
 (Applause) 
 One of the real challengesnis to innovate fundamentally in education.,Innovation is hard,,because it means doing somethingnthat people don't find very easy,,for the most part.,It means challengingnwhat we take for granted,,things that we think are obvious.,The great problem for reformnor transformation,is the tyranny of common sense.,Things that people think,,"It can't be done differently,nthat's how it's done." 
 I came across a great quote recentlynfrom Abraham Lincoln,,who I thought you'd be pleasednto have quoted at this point. 
 (Laughter) 
 He said this in December 1862nto the second annual meeting of Congress.,I ought to explain that I have no ideanwhat was happening at the time.,We don't teachnAmerican history in Britain. 
 (Laughter) 
 We suppress it.nYou know, this is our policy. 
 (Laughter) 
 No doubt, something fascinatingnwas happening then,,which the Americans among usnwill be aware of. 
 But he said this:,"The dogmas of the quiet pastnare inadequate to the stormy present.,The occasionnis piled high with difficulty,,and we must rise with the occasion.",I love that.,Not rise to it, rise with it.,"As our case is new,,so we must think anew and act anew.,We must disenthrall ourselves,,and then we shall save our country." 
 I love that word, "disenthrall.",You know what it means?,That there are ideasnthat all of us are enthralled to,,which we simply take for grantednas the natural order of things,,the way things are.,And many of our ideas have been formed,,not to meet the circumstancesnof this century,,but to cope with the circumstancesnof previous centuries.,But our mindsnare still hypnotized by them,,and we have to disenthrall ourselvesnof some of them.,Now, doing this is easier said than done.,It's very hard to know, by the way,nwhat it is you take for granted.,And the reasonnis that you take it for granted. 
 (Laughter) 
 Let me ask you somethingnyou may take for granted.,How many of you herenare over the age of 25?,That's not what you take for granted,nI'm sure you're familiar with that.,Are there any people herenunder the age of 25?,Great. Now, those over 25,,could you put your hands upnif you're wearing your wristwatch?,Now that's a great deal of us, isn't it?,Ask a room full of teenagersnthe same thing.,Teenagers do not wear wristwatches.,I don't mean they can't,,they just often choose not to.,And the reason is we were brought upnin a pre-digital culture,,those of us over 25.,And so for us,nif you want to know the time,,you have to wear something to tell it.,Kids now live in a worldnwhich is digitized,,and the time, for them, is everywhere.,They see no reason to do this.,And by the way, you don't need either;,it's just that you've always done itnand you carry on doing it.,My daughter never wears a watch,nmy daughter Kate, who's 20.,She doesn't see the point.,As she says,,"It's a single-function device." 
 (Laughter) 
 "Like, how lame is that?",And I say, "No, no,nit tells the date as well." 
 (Laughter) 
 "It has multiple functions." 
 (Laughter) 
 But, you see, there are thingsnwe're enthralled to in education.,A couple of examples.,One of them is the idea of linearity:,that it starts herenand you go through a track,and if you do everything right,,you will end up setnfor the rest of your life.,Everybody who's spoken at TEDnhas told us implicitly,,or sometimes explicitly,na different story:,that life is not linear; it's organic.,We create our lives symbiotically,as we explore our talents,in relation to the circumstancesnthey help to create for us.,But, you know, we have become obsessednwith this linear narrative.,And probably the pinnacle for educationnis getting you to college.,I think we are obsessednwith getting people to college.,Certain sorts of college.,I don't mean you shouldn't go,nbut not everybody needs to go,,or go now.,Maybe they go later, not right away. 
 And I was up in San Franciscona while ago doing a book signing.,There was this guy buying a book,nhe was in his 30s.,I said, "What do you do?",And he said, "I'm a fireman.",I asked, "How longnhave you been a fireman?","Always. I've always been a fireman.","Well, when did you decide?"nHe said, "As a kid.,Actually, it wasna problem for me at school,,because at school,neverybody wanted to be a fireman." 
 (Laughter) 
 He said, "But I wanted to be a fireman.",And he said, "When I gotnto the senior year of school,,my teachers didn't take it seriously.,This one teacher didn't take it seriously.,He said I was throwing my life away,if that's all I chose to do with it;,that I should go to college, I shouldnbecome a professional person,,that I had great potential,and I was wasting my talent to do that.",He said, "It was humiliating.,It was in front of the whole classnand I felt dreadful.,But it's what I wanted,nand as soon as I left school,,I applied to the fire servicenand I was accepted.,You know, I was thinkingnabout that guy recently,,just a few minutes ago when younwere speaking, about this teacher,,because six months ago, I saved his life." 
 (Laughter) 
 He said, "He was in a car wreck,nand I pulled him out, gave him CPR,,and I saved his wife's life as well.",He said, "I think he thinksnbetter of me now." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 You know, to me,,human communities dependnupon a diversity of talent,,not a singular conception of ability.,And at the heart of our challenges -- 
 (Applause) 
 At the heart of the challenge,is to reconstitute our sense of abilitynand of intelligence.,This linearity thing is a problem. 
 When I arrived in L.A.nabout nine years ago,,I came across a policy statement --,very well-intentioned --,which said, "Collegenbegins in kindergarten.",No, it doesn't. 
 (Laughter) 
 It doesn't.,If we had time,nI could go into this, but we don't. 
 (Laughter) 
 Kindergarten begins in kindergarten. 
 (Laughter) 
 A friend of mine once said,,"A three year-oldnis not half a six year-old." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 They're three. 
 But as we just heard in this last session,,there's such competition nownto get into kindergarten --,to get to the right kindergarten --,that people are being interviewednfor it at three.,Kids sitting in frontnof unimpressed panels,,you know, with their resumes -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Flicking through and saying,n"What, this is it?" 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 "You've been aroundnfor 36 months, and this is it?" 
 (Laughter) 
 "You've achieved nothing -- commit. 
 (Laughter) 
 Spent the first six monthsnbreastfeeding, I can see." 
 (Laughter) 
 See, it's outrageous as a conception. 
 The other big issue is conformity.,We have built our education systemsnon the model of fast food.,This is something Jamie Oliverntalked about the other day.,There are two modelsnof quality assurance in catering.,One is fast food,nwhere everything is standardized.,The other is like Zagatnand Michelin restaurants,,where everything is not standardized,,they're customized to local circumstances.,And we have sold ourselvesninto a fast-food model of education,,and it's impoverishingnour spirit and our energies,as much as fast food is depletingnour physical bodies. 
 (Applause) 
 We have to recognizena couple of things here.,One is that human talentnis tremendously diverse.,People have very different aptitudes.,I worked out recentlynthat I was given a guitar as a kid,at about the same timenthat Eric Clapton got his first guitar. 
 (Laughter) 
 It worked out for Eric,nthat's all I'm saying. 
 (Laughter) 
 In a way --,it did not for me.,I could not get this thing to work,no matter how oftennor how hard I blew into it.,It just wouldn't work. 
 (Laughter) 
 But it's not only about that.,It's about passion.,Often, people are good at thingsnthey don't really care for.,It's about passion,,and what excitesnour spirit and our energy.,And if you're doing the thingnthat you love to do, that you're good at,,time takes a different course entirely.,My wife's just finished writing a novel,,and I think it's a great book,,but she disappears for hours on end.,You know this, if you're doingnsomething you love,,an hour feels like five minutes.,If you're doing somethingnthat doesn't resonate with your spirit,,five minutes feels like an hour.,And the reason so many peoplenare opting out of education,is because it doesn't feed their spirit,,it doesn't feed their energynor their passion. 
 So I think we have to change metaphors.,We have to go from what is essentiallynan industrial model of education,,a manufacturing model,,which is based on linearitynand conformity and batching people.,We have to move to a model,that is based morenon principles of agriculture.,We have to recognize,that human flourishingnis not a mechanical process;,it's an organic process.,And you cannot predictnthe outcome of human development.,All you can do, like a farmer,nis create the conditions,under which they will begin to flourish. 
 So when we look at reformingneducation and transforming it,,it isn't like cloning a system.,There are great ones,nlike KIPP's; it's a great system.,There are many great models.,It's about customizingnto your circumstances,and personalizing educationnto the people you're actually teaching.,And doing that, I think,nis the answer to the future,because it's notnabout scaling a new solution;,it's about creatingna movement in education,in which people developntheir own solutions,,but with external supportnbased on a personalized curriculum. 
 Now in this room,,there are people who representnextraordinary resources in business,,in multimedia, in the Internet.,These technologies,,combined with the extraordinaryntalents of teachers,,provide an opportunitynto revolutionize education.,And I urge you to get involved in it,because it's vital, not just to ourselves,nbut to the future of our children.,But we have to changenfrom the industrial model,to an agricultural model,,where each school can benflourishing tomorrow.,That's where children experience life.,Or at home, if that's what they choose,,to be educatednwith their families or friends. 
 There's been a lot of talk about dreamsnover the course of these few days.,And I wanted to just very quickly --,I was very strucknby Natalie Merchant's songs last night,,recovering old poems.,I wanted to read youna quick, very short poem,from W. B. Yeats,nwho some of you may know.,He wrote this to his love, Maud Gonne,,and he was bewailing the fact,that he couldn't really give hernwhat he thought she wanted from him.,And he says, "I've got something else,nbut it may not be for you." 
 He says this:,"Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths,,Enwrought with gold and silver light,,The blue and the dim and the dark cloths,Of night and light and the half-light,,I would spread the cloths under your feet:,But I, being poor, have only my dreams;,I have spread my dreams under your feet;,Tread softly,because you tread on my dreams.",And every day, everywhere,,our children spreadntheir dreams beneath our feet.,And we should tread softly. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Well, there's lots to talk about,,but I think I'm just going to play to start off. 
 (Music) 
 ♫ When I wake up ♫,♫ in the morning ♫,♫ I pour the coffee ♫,♫ I read the paper ♫,♫ And then I slowly ♫,♫ and so softly ♫,♫ do the dishes ♫,♫ So feed the fishes ♫,♫ You sing me happy birthday ♫,♫ Like it's gonna be ♫,♫ your last day ♫,♫ here on Earth ♫ 
 (Applause) 
 All right.,So, I wanted to do something special today.,I want to debut a new song that I've been working on,in the last five or six months.,And there's few things more thrilling,than playing a song,for the first time in front of an audience,,especially when it's half-finished.,(Laughter),I'm kind of hoping some conversations here,might help me finish it.,Because it gets into all sorts,of crazy realms.,And so this is basically a song,about loops,,but not the kind of loops that I make up here.,They're feedback loops.,And in the audio world,that's when the microphone gets too close,to its sound source,,and then it gets in this self-destructive loop,that creates a very unpleasant sound.,And I'm going to demonstrate for you.,(Laughter),I'm not going to hurt you. Don't worry. 
 ♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫,♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫,♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫,♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫,♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫,♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫,♫ This is a -- (Feedback) 
 All right. I don't know if that was necessary to demonstrate --,(Laughter),-- but my point is it's the sound of self-destruction. 
 And I've been thinking about,how that applies across a whole spectrum of realms,,from, say, the ecological, okay.,There seems to be a rule in nature,that if you get too close to where you came from,,it gets ugly.,So like, you can't feed cows their own brains,or you get mad cow disease,,and inbreeding and incest,and, let's see,,what's the other one?,Biological -- there's autoimmune diseases,,where the body attacks itself,a little too overzealously,and destroys the host,,or the person.,And then -- okay, this is where we get to the song --,kind of bridges the gap to the emotional. 
 Because although I've used scientific terms,in songs,,it's very difficult sometimes to make them lyrical.,And there's some things,you just don't need to have in songs.,So I'm trying to bridge this gap,between this idea and this melody.,And so, I don't know if you've ever had this,,but when I close my eyes sometimes,and try to sleep,,I can't stop thinking about my own eyes.,And it's like your eyes,start straining to see themselves.,That's what it feels like to me.,It's not pleasant.,I'm sorry if I put that idea in your head.,(Laughter),It's impossible, of course, for your eyes to see themselves,,but they seem to be trying.,So that's getting a little more closer to a personal experience.,Or ears being able to hear themselves --,it's just impossible.,That's the thing.,So, I've been working on this song,that mentions these things,and then also imagines,a person who's been so successful,at defending themselves from heartbreak,that they're left to do the deed themselves,,if that's possible.,And that's what the song is asking.,All right.,It doesn't have a name yet. 
 (Music) 
 ♫ Go ahead and congratulate yourself ♫,♫ Give yourself a hand, the hand is your hand ♫,♫ And the eye that eyes itself is your eye ♫,♫ And the ear that hears itself is near ♫,♫ 'Cause it's your ear, oh oh ♫,♫ You've done the impossible now ♫,♫ Took yourself apart ♫,♫ You made yourself invulnerable ♫,♫ No one can break your heart ♫,♫ So you wear it out ♫,♫ And you wring it out ♫,♫ And you wear it out ♫,♫ And you break it yourself ♫,♫ Breaking your own, break it yourself ♫,♫ Breaking your own, break it yourself ♫,♫ Breaking your own ♫,(Applause) 
 Thanks.,(Applause),All right.,It's kind of cool. Songwriters can sort of get away with murder.,You can throw out crazy theories,and not have to back it up with data,or graphs or research.,But, you know, I think reckless curiosity,would be what the world needs now,,just a little bit.,(Applause),I'm going to finish up with a song of mine,called "Weather Systems."

 (Applause)So, I've known a lot of fish in my life.,I've loved only two.,That first one,,it was more like a passionate affair.,It was a beautiful fish:,flavorful, textured, meaty,,a bestseller on the menu.,What a fish.,(Laughter),Even better,,it was farm-raised to the supposed highest standards,of sustainability.,So you could feel good about selling it. 
 I was in a relationship with this beauty,for several months.,One day, the head of the company called,and asked if I'd speak at an event,about the farm's sustainability.,"Absolutely," I said.,Here was a company trying to solve,what's become this unimaginable problem for us chefs:,How do we keep fish on our menus? 
 For the past 50 years,,we've been fishing the seas,like we clear-cut forests.,It's hard to overstate the destruction.,Ninety percent of large fish, the ones we love --,the tunas, the halibuts, the salmons, swordfish --,they've collapsed.,There's almost nothing left.,So, for better or for worse,,aquaculture, fish farming, is going to be a part of our future.,A lot of arguments against it:,Fish farms pollute -- most of them do anyway --,and they're inefficient. Take tuna,,a major drawback.,It's got a feed conversion ratio,of 15 to one.,That means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish,to get you one pound of farm tuna.,Not very sustainable.,It doesn't taste very good either. 
 So here, finally,,was a company trying to do it right.,I wanted to support them.,The day before the event,,I called the head of P.R. for the company.,Let's call him Don. 
 "Don," I said, "just to get the facts straight, you guys are famous,for farming so far out to sea, you don't pollute." 
 "That's right," he said. "We're so far out,,the waste from our fish gets distributed,,not concentrated.",And then he added,,"We're basically a world unto ourselves.,That feed conversion ratio? 2.5 to one," he said.,"Best in the business." 
 2.5 to one, great.,"2.5 what? What are you feeding?" 
 "Sustainable proteins," he said. 
 "Great," I said. Got off the phone.,And that night, I was lying in bed, and I thought:,What the hell is a sustainable protein?,(Laughter) 
 So the next day, just before the event, I called Don.,I said, "Don, what are some examples of sustainable proteins?" 
 He said he didn't know. He would ask around.,Well, I got on the phone with a few people in the company;,no one could give me a straight answer,until finally, I got on the phone,with the head biologist.,Let's call him Don too.,(Laughter) 
 "Don," I said,,"what are some examples of sustainable proteins?" 
 Well, he mentioned some algaes,and some fish meals,,and then he said chicken pellets.,I said, "Chicken pellets?" 
 He said, "Yeah, feathers, skin,,bone meal, scraps,,dried and processed into feed." 
 I said, "What percentage,of your feed is chicken?",Thinking, you know, two percent. 
 "Well, it's about 30 percent," he said. 
 I said, "Don, what's sustainable,about feeding chicken to fish?",(Laughter) 
 There was a long pause on the line,,and he said, "There's just too much chicken in the world.",(Laughter) 
 I fell out of love with this fish.,(Laughter),No, not because I'm some self-righteous,,goody-two shoes foodie.,I actually am.,(Laughter),No, I actually fell out of love with this fish because, I swear to God,,after that conversation, the fish tasted like chicken.,(Laughter) 
 This second fish,,it's a different kind of love story.,It's the romantic kind,,the kind where the more you get to know your fish,,you love the fish.,I first ate it at a restaurant,in southern Spain.,A journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time.,She kind of set us up.,(Laughter),It came to the table,a bright, almost shimmering, white color.,The chef had overcooked it.,Like twice over.,Amazingly, it was still delicious. 
 Who can make a fish taste good,after it's been overcooked?,I can't,,but this guy can.,Let's call him Miguel --,actually his name is Miguel.,(Laughter),And no, he didn't cook the fish, and he's not a chef,,at least in the way that you and I understand it.,He's a biologist,at Veta La Palma.,It's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain.,It's at the tip of the Guadalquivir river. 
 Until the 1980s,,the farm was in the hands of the Argentinians.,They raised beef cattle,on what was essentially wetlands.,They did it by draining the land.,They built this intricate series of canals,,and they pushed water off the land and out into the river.,Well, they couldn't make it work,,not economically.,And ecologically, it was a disaster.,It killed like 90 percent of the birds,,which, for this place, is a lot of birds.,And so in 1982,,a Spanish company with an environmental conscience,purchased the land. 
 What did they do?,They reversed the flow of water.,They literally flipped the switch.,Instead of pushing water out,,they used the channels to pull water back in.,They flooded the canals.,They created a 27,000-acre fish farm --,bass, mullet,,shrimp, eel --,and in the process, Miguel and this company,completely reversed the ecological destruction.,The farm's incredible.,I mean, you've never seen anything like this.,You stare out at a horizon,that is a million miles away,,and all you see are flooded canals,and this thick, rich marshland. 
 I was there not long ago with Miguel.,He's an amazing guy,,like three parts Charles Darwin and one part Crocodile Dundee.,(Laughter),Okay? There we are slogging through the wetlands,,and I'm panting and sweating, got mud up to my knees,,and Miguel's calmly conducting a biology lecture.,Here, he's pointing out a rare Black-shouldered Kite.,Now, he's mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton.,And here, here he sees a grouping pattern,that reminds him of the Tanzanian Giraffe. 
 It turns out, Miguel spent the better part of his career,in the Mikumi National Park in Africa.,I asked him how he became,such an expert on fish. 
 He said, "Fish? I didn't know anything about fish.,I'm an expert in relationships.",And then he's off, launching into more talk,about rare birds and algaes,and strange aquatic plants. 
 And don't get me wrong, that was really fascinating, you know,,the biotic community unplugged, kind of thing.,It's great, but I was in love.,And my head was swooning over that,overcooked piece of delicious fish I had the night before.,So I interrupted him. I said,,"Miguel, what makes your fish taste so good?" 
 He pointed at the algae. 
 "I know, dude, the algae, the phytoplankton,,the relationships: It's amazing.,But what are your fish eating?,What's the feed conversion ratio?" 
 Well, he goes on to tell me,it's such a rich system,that the fish are eating what they'd be eating in the wild.,The plant biomass, the phytoplankton,,the zooplankton, it's what feeds the fish.,The system is so healthy,,it's totally self-renewing.,There is no feed.,Ever heard of a farm that doesn't feed its animals? 
 Later that day, I was driving around this property with Miguel,,and I asked him, I said, "For a place that seems so natural,,unlike like any farm I'd ever been at,,how do you measure success?" 
 At that moment, it was as if,a film director called for a set change.,And we rounded the corner,and saw the most amazing sight:,thousands and thousands of pink flamingos,,a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see. 
 "That's success," he said.,"Look at their bellies, pink.,They're feasting.",Feasting? I was totally confused. 
 I said, "Miguel, aren't they feasting on your fish?",(Laughter) 
 "Yes," he said.,(Laughter),"We lose 20 percent of our fish,and fish eggs to birds.,Well, last year, this property,had 600,000 birds on it,,more than 250 different species.,It's become, today, the largest,and one of the most important,private bird sanctuaries in all of Europe." 
 I said, "Miguel, isn't a thriving bird population,like the last thing you want on a fish farm?",(Laughter),He shook his head, no. 
 He said, "We farm extensively,,not intensively.,This is an ecological network.,The flamingos eat the shrimp.,The shrimp eat the phytoplankton.,So the pinker the belly,,the better the system." 
 Okay, so let's review:,a farm that doesn't feed its animals,,and a farm that measures its success,on the health of its predators.,A fish farm, but also a bird sanctuary.,Oh, and by the way, those flamingos,,they shouldn't even be there in the first place.,They brood in a town,150 miles away,,where the soil conditions,are better for building nests.,Every morning, they fly,150 miles into the farm.,And every evening, they fly 150 miles back.,(Laughter),They do that because they're able to follow,the broken white line,of highway A92.,(Laughter),No kidding. 
 I was imagining a "March of the Penguins" thing,,so I looked at Miguel.,I said, "Miguel, do they fly,150 miles to the farm,,and then do they fly,150 miles back at night?,Do they do that for the children?" 
 He looked at me like I had just quoted a Whitney Houston song.,(Laughter),He said, "No; they do it because the food's better.",(Laughter) 
 I didn't mention the skin of my beloved fish,,which was delicious -- and I don't like fish skin;,I don't like it seared, I don't like it crispy.,It's that acrid, tar-like flavor.,I almost never cook with it.,Yet, when I tasted it at that restaurant in southern Spain,,it tasted not at all like fish skin.,It tasted sweet and clean,,like you were taking a bite of the ocean.,I mentioned that to Miguel, and he nodded.,He said, "The skin acts like a sponge.,It's the last defense before anything enters the body.,It evolved to soak up impurities.",And then he added,,"But our water has no impurities." 
 OK. A farm that doesn't feed its fish,,a farm that measures its success,by the success of its predators.,And then I realized when he says,,"A farm that has no impurities,",he made a big understatement,,because the water that flows through that farm,comes in from the Guadalquivir River.,It's a river that carries with it,all the things that rivers tend to carry these days:,chemical contaminants,,pesticide runoff.,And when it works its way through the system,and leaves,,the water is cleaner than when it entered.,The system is so healthy, it purifies the water.,So, not just a farm that doesn't feed its animals,,not just a farm that measures its success,by the health of its predators,,but a farm that's literally a water purification plant --,and not just for those fish,,but for you and me as well.,Because when that water leaves, it dumps out into the Atlantic.,A drop in the ocean, I know,,but I'll take it, and so should you,,because this love story,,however romantic,,is also instructive.,You might say it's a recipe,for the future of good food,,whether we're talking about bass or beef cattle. 
 What we need now is,a radically new conception of agriculture,,one in which the food actually tastes good.,(Laughter),(Applause),But for a lot people,,that's a bit too radical.,We're not realists, us foodies;,we're lovers.,We love farmers' markets,,we love small family farms,,we talk about local food,,we eat organic.,And when you suggest these are the things,that will ensure the future of good food,,someone, somewhere stands up and says,,"Hey guy, I love pink flamingos,,but how are you going to feed the world?",How are you going to feed the world? 
 Can I be honest?,I don't love that question.,No, not because we already produce,enough calories to more than feed the world.,One billion people will go hungry today.,One billion -- that's more than ever before --,because of gross inequalities in distribution,,not tonnage.,Now, I don't love this question because it's determined the logic,of our food system for the last 50 years. 
 Feed grain to herbivores,,pesticides to monocultures, chemicals to soil,,chicken to fish,,and all along agribusiness,has simply asked,,"If we're feeding more people more cheaply,,how terrible could that be?",That's been the motivation,,it's been the justification:,it's been the business plan,of American agriculture.,We should call it what it is:,a business in liquidation,,a business that's quickly eroding,ecological capital that makes that very production possible.,That's not a business,,and it isn't agriculture. 
 Our breadbasket is threatened today,,not because of diminishing supply,,but because of diminishing resources.,Not by the latest combine and tractor invention,,but by fertile land;,not by pumps, but by fresh water;,not by chainsaws, but by forests;,and not by fishing boats and nets, but by fish in the sea. 
 Want to feed the world?,Let's start by asking: How are we going to feed ourselves?,Or better: How can we create conditions,that enable every community,to feed itself?,(Applause),To do that,,don't look at the agribusiness model for the future.,It's really old, and it's tired.,It's high on capital, chemistry and machines,,and it's never produced anything really good to eat.,Instead, let's look to the ecological model.,That's the one that relies on two billion years,of on-the-job experience. 
 Look to Miguel,,farmers like Miguel.,Farms that aren't worlds unto themselves;,farms that restore instead of deplete;,farms that farm extensively,instead of just intensively;,farmers that are not just producers,,but experts in relationships.,Because they're the ones,that are experts in flavor, too.,And if I'm going to be really honest,,they're a better chef than I'll ever be.,You know, I'm okay with that,,because if that's the future of good food, it's going to be delicious. 
 Thank you.,(Applause)Everybody talks about happiness these days.,I had somebody count the number of books,with "happiness" in the title published in the last five years,and they gave up after about 40, and there were many more.,There is a huge wave of interest in happiness,,among researchers.,There is a lot of happiness coaching.,Everybody would like to make people happier.,But in spite of all this flood of work,,there are several cognitive traps,that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight,about happiness. 
 And my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps.,This applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness,,and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness,,because it turns out we're just as messed up as anybody else is.,The first of these traps,is a reluctance to admit complexity.,It turns out that the word "happiness",is just not a useful word anymore,,because we apply it to too many different things.,I think there is one particular meaning to which we might restrict it,,but by and large,,this is something that we'll have to give up,and we'll have to adopt the more complicated view,of what well-being is.,The second trap is a confusion between experience and memory;,basically, it's between being happy in your life,,and being happy about your life,or happy with your life.,And those are two very different concepts,,and they're both lumped in the notion of happiness.,And the third is the focusing illusion,,and it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance,that affects well-being,without distorting its importance.,I mean, this is a real cognitive trap.,There's just no way of getting it right. 
 Now, I'd like to start with an example,of somebody who had a question-and-answer session,after one of my lectures reported a story,,and that was a story --,He said he'd been listening to a symphony,,and it was absolutely glorious music,and at the very end of the recording,,there was a dreadful screeching sound.,And then he added, really quite emotionally,,it ruined the whole experience.,But it hadn't.,What it had ruined were the memories of the experience.,He had had the experience.,He had had 20 minutes of glorious music.,They counted for nothing,because he was left with a memory;,the memory was ruined,,and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep. 
 What this is telling us, really,,is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people,in terms of two selves.,There is an experiencing self,,who lives in the present,and knows the present,,is capable of re-living the past,,but basically it has only the present.,It's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches --,you know, when the doctor asks,,"Does it hurt now when I touch you here?",And then there is a remembering self,,and the remembering self is the one that keeps score,,and maintains the story of our life,,and it's the one that the doctor approaches,in asking the question,,"How have you been feeling lately?",or "How was your trip to Albania?" or something like that.,Those are two very different entities,,the experiencing self and the remembering self,,and getting confused between them is part of the mess,about the notion of happiness. 
 Now, the remembering self,is a storyteller.,And that really starts with a basic response of our memories --,it starts immediately.,We don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories.,Our memory tells us stories,,that is, what we get to keep from our experiences,is a story.,And let me begin with one example.,This is an old study.,Those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure.,I won't go into detail. It's no longer painful these days,,but it was painful when this study was run in the 1990s.,They were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds.,Here are two patients,,those are their recordings.,And you are asked, "Who of them suffered more?",And it's a very easy question.,Clearly, Patient B suffered more --,his colonoscopy was longer,,and every minute of pain that Patient A had,,Patient B had, and more. 
 But now there is another question:,"How much did these patients think they suffered?",And here is a surprise.,The surprise is that Patient A,had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy,than Patient B.,The stories of the colonoscopies were different,,and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends.,And neither of these stories is very inspiring or great --,but one of them is this distinct ... (Laughter),but one of them is distinctly worse than the other.,And the one that is worse,is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end;,it's a bad story.,How do we know that?,Because we asked these people after their colonoscopy,,and much later, too,,"How bad was the whole thing, in total?",And it was much worse for A than for B, in memory. 
 Now this is a direct conflict,between the experiencing self and the remembering self.,From the point of view of the experiencing self,,clearly, B had a worse time.,Now, what you could do with Patient A,,and we actually ran clinical experiments,,and it has been done, and it does work --,you could actually extend the colonoscopy of Patient A,by just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much.,That will cause the patient,to suffer, but just a little,and much less than before.,And if you do that for a couple of minutes,,you have made the experiencing self,of Patient A worse off,,and you have the remembering self of Patient A,a lot better off,,because now you have endowed Patient A,with a better story,about his experience.,What defines a story?,And that is true of the stories,that memory delivers for us,,and it's also true of the stories that we make up.,What defines a story are changes,,significant moments and endings.,Endings are very, very important,and, in this case, the ending dominated. 
 Now, the experiencing self,lives its life continuously.,It has moments of experience, one after the other.,And you can ask: What happens to these moments?,And the answer is really straightforward:,They are lost forever.,I mean, most of the moments of our life --,and I calculated, you know, the psychological present,is said to be about three seconds long;,that means that, you know,,in a life there are about 600 million of them;,in a month, there are about 600,000 --,most of them don't leave a trace.,Most of them are completely ignored,by the remembering self.,And yet, somehow you get the sense,that they should count,,that what happens during these moments of experience,is our life.,It's the finite resource that we're spending,while we're on this earth.,And how to spend it,would seem to be relevant,,but that is not the story,that the remembering self keeps for us. 
 So we have the remembering self,and the experiencing self,,and they're really quite distinct.,The biggest difference between them,is in the handling of time.,From the point of view of the experiencing self,,if you have a vacation,,and the second week is just as good as the first,,then the two-week vacation,is twice as good as the one-week vacation.,That's not the way it works at all for the remembering self.,For the remembering self, a two-week vacation,is barely better than the one-week vacation,because there are no new memories added.,You have not changed the story.,And in this way,,time is actually the critical variable,that distinguishes a remembering self,from an experiencing self;,time has very little impact on the story. 
 Now, the remembering self does more,than remember and tell stories.,It is actually the one that makes decisions,because, if you have a patient who has had, say,,two colonoscopies with two different surgeons,and is deciding which of them to choose,,then the one that chooses,is the one that has the memory that is less bad,,and that's the surgeon that will be chosen.,The experiencing self,has no voice in this choice.,We actually don't choose between experiences,,we choose between memories of experiences.,And even when we think about the future,,we don't think of our future normally as experiences.,We think of our future,as anticipated memories.,And basically you can look at this,,you know, as a tyranny of the remembering self,,and you can think of the remembering self,sort of dragging the experiencing self,through experiences that,the experiencing self doesn't need. 
 I have that sense that,when we go on vacations,this is very frequently the case;,that is, we go on vacations,,to a very large extent,,in the service of our remembering self.,And this is a bit hard to justify I think.,I mean, how much do we consume our memories?,That is one of the explanations,that is given for the dominance,of the remembering self.,And when I think about that, I think about a vacation,we had in Antarctica a few years ago,,which was clearly the best vacation I've ever had,,and I think of it relatively often,,relative to how much I think of other vacations.,And I probably have consumed,my memories of that three-week trip, I would say,,for about 25 minutes in the last four years.,Now, if I had ever opened the folder,with the 600 pictures in it,,I would have spent another hour.,Now, that is three weeks,,and that is at most an hour and a half.,There seems to be a discrepancy.,Now, I may be a bit extreme, you know,,in how little appetite I have for consuming memories,,but even if you do more of this,,there is a genuine question:,Why do we put so much weight on memory,relative to the weight that we put on experiences? 
 So I want you to think,about a thought experiment.,Imagine that for your next vacation,,you know that at the end of the vacation,all your pictures will be destroyed,,and you'll get an amnesic drug,so that you won't remember anything.,Now, would you choose the same vacation? (Laughter),And if you would choose a different vacation,,there is a conflict between your two selves,,and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict,,and it's actually not at all obvious, because,if you think in terms of time,,then you get one answer,,and if you think in terms of memories,,you might get another answer.,Why do we pick the vacations we do,is a problem that confronts us,with a choice between the two selves. 
 Now, the two selves,bring up two notions of happiness.,There are really two concepts of happiness,that we can apply, one per self.,So you can ask: How happy is the experiencing self?,And then you would ask: How happy are the moments,in the experiencing self's life?,And they're all -- happiness for moments,is a fairly complicated process.,What are the emotions that can be measured?,And, by the way, now we are capable,of getting a pretty good idea,of the happiness of the experiencing self over time.,If you ask for the happiness of the remembering self,,it's a completely different thing.,This is not about how happily a person lives.,It is about how satisfied or pleased the person is,when that person thinks about her life.,Very different notion.,Anyone who doesn't distinguish those notions,is going to mess up the study of happiness,,and I belong to a crowd of students of well-being,,who've been messing up the study of happiness for a long time,in precisely this way. 
 The distinction between the,happiness of the experiencing self,and the satisfaction of the remembering self,has been recognized in recent years,,and there are now efforts to measure the two separately.,The Gallup Organization has a world poll,where more than half a million people,have been asked questions,about what they think of their life,and about their experiences,,and there have been other efforts along those lines.,So in recent years, we have begun to learn,about the happiness of the two selves.,And the main lesson I think that we have learned,is they are really different.,You can know how satisfied somebody is with their life,,and that really doesn't teach you much,about how happily they're living their life,,and vice versa.,Just to give you a sense of the correlation,,the correlation is about .5.,What that means is if you met somebody,,and you were told, "Oh his father is six feet tall,",how much would you know about his height?,Well, you would know something about his height,,but there's a lot of uncertainty.,You have that much uncertainty.,If I tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten,,you have a lot of uncertainty,about how happy they are,with their experiencing self.,So the correlation is low. 
 We know something about what controls,satisfaction of the happiness self.,We know that money is very important,,goals are very important.,We know that happiness is mainly,being satisfied with people that we like,,spending time with people that we like.,There are other pleasures, but this is dominant.,So if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves,,you are going to end up,doing very different things.,The bottom line of what I've said here,is that we really should not think of happiness,as a substitute for well-being.,It is a completely different notion. 
 Now, very quickly,,another reason we cannot think straight about happiness,is that we do not attend to the same things,when we think about life, and we actually live.,So, if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California,,you are not going to get to the correct answer.,When you ask that question,,you think people must be happier in California,if, say, you live in Ohio.,(Laughter),And what happens is,when you think about living in California,,you are thinking of the contrast,between California and other places,,and that contrast, say, is in climate.,Well, it turns out that climate,is not very important to the experiencing self,and it's not even very important to the reflective self,that decides how happy people are.,But now, because the reflective self is in charge,,you may end up -- some people may end up,moving to California.,And it's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen,to people who move to California in the hope of getting happier.,Well, their experiencing self,is not going to get happier.,We know that.,But one thing will happen: They will think they are happier,,because, when they think about it,,they'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in Ohio,,and they will feel they made the right decision. 
 It is very difficult,to think straight about well-being,,and I hope I have given you a sense,of how difficult it is. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: Thank you. I've got a question for you.,Thank you so much.,Now, when we were on the phone a few weeks ago,,you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result,came out of that Gallup survey.,Is that something you can share,since you do have a few moments left now? 
 Daniel Kahneman: Sure.,I think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup survey,is a number, which we absolutely did not expect to find.,We found that with respect to the happiness,of the experiencing self.,When we looked at how feelings,,vary with income.,And it turns out that, below an income,of 60,000 dollars a year, for Americans --,and that's a very large sample of Americans, like 600,000,,so it's a large representative sample --,below an income of 600,000 dollars a year... 
 CA: 60,000. 
 DK: 60,000.,(Laughter),60,000 dollars a year, people are unhappy,,and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get.,Above that, we get an absolutely flat line.,I mean I've rarely seen lines so flat.,Clearly, what is happening is,money does not buy you experiential happiness,,but lack of money certainly buys you misery,,and we can measure that misery,very, very clearly.,In terms of the other self, the remembering self,,you get a different story.,The more money you earn, the more satisfied you are.,That does not hold for emotions. 
 CA: But Danny, the whole American endeavor is about,life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness.,If people took seriously that finding,,I mean, it seems to turn upside down,everything we believe about, like for example,,taxation policy and so forth.,Is there any chance that politicians, that the country generally,,would take a finding like that seriously,and run public policy based on it? 
 DK: You know I think that there is recognition,of the role of happiness research in public policy.,The recognition is going to be slow in the United States,,no question about that,,but in the U.K., it is happening,,and in other countries it is happening.,People are recognizing that they ought,to be thinking of happiness,when they think of public policy.,It's going to take a while,,and people are going to debate,whether they want to study experience happiness,,or whether they want to study life evaluation,,so we need to have that debate fairly soon.,How to enhance happiness,goes very different ways depending on how you think,,and whether you think of the remembering self,or you think of the experiencing self.,This is going to influence policy, I think, in years to come.,In the United States, efforts are being made,to measure the experience happiness of the population.,This is going to be, I think, within the next decade or two,,part of national statistics. 
 CA: Well, it seems to me that this issue will -- or at least should be --,the most interesting policy discussion to track,over the next few years.,Thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics.,Thank you, Danny Kahneman.Someone once said that politics is, of course, "showbiz for ugly people.",So, on that basis, I feel like I've really arrived.,The other thing to think of is what an honor it is, as a politician,,to give a TED talk, particularly here in the U.K.,,where the reputation of politics, with the expenses scandal, has sunk so low. 
 There was even a story recently that scientists had thought about,actually replacing rats in their experiments with politicians.,And someone asked,"Why?",and they said, "Well, there's no shortage of politicians,,no one really minds what happens to them,and, after all, there are some things that rats just won't do.",(Laughter) 
 Now, I know you all love data, so I'm starting with a data-rich slide.,This, I think, is the most important fact to bear in mind,in British politics or American politics,,and that is: We have run out of money.,We have vast budget deficits.,This is my global public debt clock,,and, as you can see, it's 32 trillion and counting. 
 And I think what this leads to,is a very simple recognition,,that there's one question in politics at the moment above all other,,and it's this one: How do we make things better without spending more money?,Because there isn't going to be a lot of money to improve public services,,or to improve government, or to improve so many of the things,that politicians talk about.,So what follows from that is that if you think it's all about money --,you can only measure success in public services,in health care and education and policing by spending more money,,you can only measure progress by spending money --,you're going to have a pretty miserable time. 
 But if you think a whole lot of other things matter that lead up to well being --,things like your family relationships, friendship, community, values --,then, actually, this is an incredibly exciting time to be in politics.,And the really simple argument I want to make tonight,,the really straightforward argument is this:,That if we combine the right political philosophy, the right political thinking,,with the incredible information revolution that has taken place,,and that all of you know so much more about than I do,,I think there's an incredible opportunity to actually remake politics,,remake government, remake public services,,and achieve what's up on that slide, which is a big increase in our well-being.,That's the argument I want to make tonight. 
 So, starting with the political philosophy.,Now I'm not saying for a minute that British Conservatives have all the answers.,Of course we don't.,But there are two things at heart that I think drive a conservative philosophy,that are really relevant to this whole debate.,The first is this: We believe that if you give people,more power and control over their lives,,if you give people more choice,,if you put them in the driving seat,,then actually, you can create a stronger and better society.,And if you marry this fact with the incredible abundance,of information that we have in our world today,,I think you can completely, as I've said,,remake politics, remake government, remake your public services. 
 The second thing we believe is we believe in going with the grain of human nature.,Politics and politicians will only succeed,if they actually try and treat with people as they are,,rather than as they would like them to be.,Now, if you combine this very simple, very conservative thought --,go with the grain of human nature --,with all the advances in behavioral economics,,some of which we were just hearing about,,again, I think we can achieve a real increase in well-being,,in happiness, in a stronger society,without necessarily having to spend a whole lot more money. 
 Now, why do I think now is the moment to make this argument?,Well, I'm afraid you're going to suffer a short, condensed history lesson,about what I would say are the three passages of history:,the pre-bureaucratic age, the bureaucratic age,and what we now live in, which I think is a post-bureaucratic age.,A simpler way of thinking of it,is that we have gone from a world of local control,,then we went to a world of central control,,and now we're in a world of people control.,Local power, central power, now, people power. 
 Now, here is King Cnut, king a thousand years ago.,Thought he could turn back the waves; couldn't turn back the waves.,Couldn't actually turn back very much,,because if you were king a thousand years ago,,while it still took hours and hours and weeks and weeks to traverse your own country,,there wasn't much you were in charge of.,You weren't in charge of policing, justice, education, health, welfare.,You could just about go to war and that was about it.,This was the pre-bureaucratic age,,an age in which everything had to be local.,You had to have local control because there was no nationally-available information,because travel was so restricted.,So this was the pre-bureaucratic age. 
 Next part of the cold history lesson,,the lovely picture of the British Industrial Revolution.,Suddenly, all sorts of transport, travel information were possible,,and this gave birth to, what I like to call, the bureaucratic age.,And hopefully this slide is going to morph beautifully. There we are.,Suddenly, you have the big, strong, central state.,It was able -- but only it was able -- to organize,health care, education, policing, justice.,And it was a world of, as I say, not local power, but now central power.,It had sucked all that power up from the localities.,It was able to do that itself. 
 The next great stage, which all of you are so familiar with:,the massive information revolution.,Just consider this one fact:,One hundred years ago, sending these 10 words cost 50 dollars.,Right now, here we are linked up to Long Beach and everywhere else,,and all these secret locations for a fraction of that cost,,and we can send and receive huge quantities of information,without it costing anything.,So we're now living in a post-bureaucratic age,,where genuine people power is possible. 
 Now, what does this mean for our politics,,for our public services, for our government?,Well I can't, in the time I've got, give huge numbers of examples,,but let me just give a few of the ways that life can change.,And this is so obvious, in a way, because,you think about how all of you have changed,the way we shop, the way we travel, the way that business is done.,That is already happened; the information and Internet revolution,has actually gone all the way through our societies in so many different ways,,but it hasn't, in every way, yet touched our government. 
 So, how could this happen?,Well, I think there are three chief ways that it should make an enormous difference:,in transparency, in greater choice and in accountability,,in giving us that genuine people power.,If we take transparency, here is one of my favorite websites,,the Missouri Accountability Portal.,In the old days, only the government could hold the information,,and only a few elected people could try and grab that information,and question it and challenge it.,Now here, on one website, one state in America,,every single dollar spent by that government,is searchable, is analyzable, is checkable. 
 Think of the huge change that means:,Any business that wants to bid for a government contract,can see what currently is being spent.,Anyone thinking, "I could do that service better, I could deliver it cheaper,",it's all available there.,We have only, in government and in politics,,started to scratch the surface of what people are doing in the commercial world,with the information revolution.,So, complete transparency will make a huge difference.,In this country, if we win the election,,we are going to make all government spending over 25,000 pounds,transparent and available online, searchable for anyone to see.,We're going to make every contract -- we're announcing this today --,available on the Internet so anyone can see,what the terms are, what the conditions are,,driving huge value for money,,but also huge increases, I believe, in well-being as well. 
 Choice. Now you all shop online, compare online, do everything online,,and yet this revolution has hardly touched the surface,of public services like education, or health care or policing,,and you're going to see this change massively.,We should be making this change,with the information revolution in our country,,with searchable health sites, so you can see what operations work out properly,,what records doctors have, the cleanliness of hospitals,,who does best at infection control --,all of the information that would once be locked in the Department of Health,is now available for all of us to see. 
 And the third of these big changes: accountability.,This, I think, is a huge change.,It is a crime map. This is a crime map from Chicago.,So, instead of having a situation where only the police have the information,about which crimes are committed where,,and we have to employ people in government,to try and hold the police to account,,suddenly, we've got this vast opportunity for people power,,where we, as citizens, can see what crimes are being committed --,where, when and by whom --,and we can hold the police to account.,And you can see this looks a bit like a chef's hat,,but actually that's an assault, the one in blue.,You can see what crime is committed where,,and you have the opportunity to hold your police force to account.,So those three ways -- transparency, accountability and choice --,will make a huge difference. 
 Now I also said the other principle,that I think we should work on is understanding of people,,is recognizing that going with the grain of human nature,you can achieve so much more.,Now, we're got a huge revolution in understanding,of why people behave in the way that they do,,and a great opportunity to put that knowledge and information to greater use.,We're working with some of these people.,We're being advised by some of these people, as was said,,to try and bring all the experience to book. 
 Let me just give you one example that I think is incredibly simple, and I love.,We want to get people to be more energy efficient.,Why? It cuts fuel poverty, it cuts their bills,,and it cuts carbon emissions at the same time.,How do you do it?,Well, we've had government information campaigns over the years,when they tell you to switch off the lights when you leave the home.,We even had -- one government minister once told us to,brush our teeth in the dark.,I don't think they lasted very long.,Look at what this does. This is a simple piece of behavioral economics.,The best way to get someone to cut their electricity bill,is to show them their own spending,,to show them what their neighbors are spending,,and then show what an energy conscious neighbor is spending.,That sort of behavioral economics,can transform people's behavior,in a way that all the bullying and all the information,and all the badgering from a government cannot possibly achieve.,Other examples are recycling.,We all know we need to recycle more.,How do we make it happen?,All the proof from America is that actually, if you pay people to recycle,,if you give them a carrot rather than a stick,,you can transform their behavior. 
 So what does all this add up to?,Here are my two favorite U.S. speeches of the last 50 years.,Obviously, here we have JFK with that incredibly simple,and powerful formulation,,"Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country,",an incredibly noble sentiment.,But when he made that speech, what could you do,to build the stronger, better society?,You could fight for your country, you could die for your country,,you could serve in your country's civil service,,but you didn't really have the information and the knowledge,and the ability to help build the stronger society in the way that you do now. 
 And I think an even more wonderful speech,,which I'm going to read a big chunk of,,which sums up what I said at the beginning,about believing there is more to life than money,,and more that we should try and measure than money.,And it is Robert Kennedy's beautiful description,of why gross national product captures so little:,It "does not allow for the health of our children,,the quality of their education, or the joy of their play.,It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages,,the intelligence of our public debate.,It measures neither our wit nor our courage,,neither our wisdom nor our learning,,neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country.,It measures everything, in short,,except that which makes life worthwhile." 
 Again, a sentiment that was so noble and beautifully put 40 years ago,,and a beautiful dream 40 years ago,,but now with the huge advances in information technology,,with the massive changes in behavioral economics,,with all that we know about how you advance well-being,,that if we combine those insights,of giving power to people, and using information to make that possible,,and using the insight of going with the grain of human nature,,while at the same time, understanding why people behave in the way they do,,it is a dream more easy to realize today,than it was when it was made in that beautiful speech 40 years ago. 
 Thank you.,(Applause)Delighted to be here,and to talk to you about a subject dear to my heart,,which is beauty.,I do the philosophy of art, aesthetics,,actually, for a living.,I try to figure out intellectually,,philosophically, psychologically,,what the experience of beauty is,,what sensibly can be said about it,and how people go off the rails in trying to understand it.,Now this is an extremely complicated subject,,in part because the things that we call beautiful,are so different.,I mean just think of the sheer variety --,a baby's face,,Berlioz's "Harold in Italy,",movies like "The Wizard of Oz",or the plays of Chekhov,,a central California landscape,,a Hokusai view of Mt. Fuji,,"Der Rosenkavalier,",a stunning match-winning goal,in a World Cup soccer match,,Van Gogh's "Starry Night,",a Jane Austen novel,,Fred Astaire dancing across the screen.,This brief list includes human beings,,natural landforms,,works of art and skilled human actions.,An account that explains the presence of beauty,in everything on this list,is not going to be easy. 
 I can, however, give you at least a taste,of what I regard,as the most powerful theory of beauty,we yet have.,And we get it not from a philosopher of art,,not from a postmodern art theorist,or a bigwig art critic.,No, this theory,comes from an expert,on barnacles and worms and pigeon breeding,,and you know who I mean:,Charles Darwin.,Of course, a lot of people think they already know,the proper answer to the question,,"What is beauty?",It's in the eye of the beholder.,It's whatever moves you personally.,Or, as some people,,especially academics prefer,,beauty is in the culturally conditioned,eye of the beholder.,People agree that paintings or movies or music,are beautiful,because their cultures determine a uniformity of aesthetic taste.,Taste for both natural beauty and for the arts,travel across cultures,with great ease.,Beethoven is adored in Japan.,Peruvians love Japanese woodblock prints.,Inca sculptures are regarded as treasures,in British museums,,while Shakespeare is translated,into every major language of the Earth.,Or just think about American jazz,or American movies --,they go everywhere.,There are many differences among the arts,,but there are also universal,,cross-cultural aesthetic pleasures,and values. 
 How can we explain,this universality?,The best answer lies in trying to reconstruct,a Darwinian evolutionary history,of our artistic and aesthetic tastes.,We need to reverse-engineer,our present artistic tastes and preferences,and explain how they came,to be engraved in our minds,by the actions of both our prehistoric,,largely pleistocene environments,,where we became fully human,,but also by the social situations,in which we evolved.,This reverse engineering,can also enlist help,from the human record,preserved in prehistory.,I mean fossils, cave paintings and so forth.,And it should take into account,what we know of the aesthetic interests,of isolated hunter-gatherer bands,that survived into the 19th and the 20th centuries. 
 Now, I personally,have no doubt whatsoever,that the experience of beauty,,with its emotional intensity and pleasure,,belongs to our evolved human psychology.,The experience of beauty is one component,in a whole series of Darwinian adaptations.,Beauty is an adaptive effect,,which we extend,and intensify,in the creation and enjoyment,of works of art and entertainment.,As many of you will know,,evolution operates by two main primary mechanisms.,The first of these is natural selection --,that's random mutation and selective retention --,along with our basic anatomy and physiology --,the evolution of the pancreas or the eye or the fingernails.,Natural selection also explains,many basic revulsions,,such as the horrid smell of rotting meat,,or fears, such as the fear of snakes,or standing close to the edge of a cliff.,Natural selection also explains pleasures --,sexual pleasure,,our liking for sweet, fat and proteins,,which in turn explains a lot of popular foods,,from ripe fruits through chocolate malts,and barbecued ribs. 
 The other great principle of evolution,is sexual selection,,and it operates very differently.,The peacock's magnificent tail,is the most famous example of this.,It did not evolve for natural survival.,In fact, it goes against natural survival.,No, the peacock's tail,results from the mating choices,made by peahens.,It's quite a familiar story.,It's women who actually push history forward.,Darwin himself, by the way,,had no doubts that the peacock's tail,was beautiful in the eyes of the peahen.,He actually used that word.,Now, keeping these ideas firmly in mind,,we can say that the experience of beauty,is one of the ways that evolution has,of arousing and sustaining,interest or fascination,,even obsession,,in order to encourage us,toward making the most adaptive decisions,for survival and reproduction.,Beauty is nature's way,of acting at a distance,,so to speak.,I mean, you can't expect to eat,an adaptively beneficial landscape.,It would hardly do to eat your baby,or your lover.,So evolution's trick,is to make them beautiful,,to have them exert a kind of magnetism,to give you the pleasure of simply looking at them. 
 Consider briefly an important source of aesthetic pleasure,,the magnetic pull,of beautiful landscapes.,People in very different cultures,all over the world,tend to like a particular kind of landscape,,a landscape that just happens to be similar,to the pleistocene savannas where we evolved.,This landscape shows up today,on calendars, on postcards,,in the design of golf courses and public parks,and in gold-framed pictures,that hang in living rooms,from New York to New Zealand.,It's a kind of Hudson River school landscape,featuring open spaces,of low grasses,interspersed with copses of trees.,The trees, by the way, are often preferred,if they fork near the ground,,that is to say, if they're trees you could scramble up,if you were in a tight fix.,The landscape shows the presence,of water directly in view,,or evidence of water in a bluish distance,,indications of animal or bird life,as well as diverse greenery,and finally -- get this --,a path,or a road,,perhaps a riverbank or a shoreline,,that extends into the distance,,almost inviting you to follow it.,This landscape type is regarded as beautiful,,even by people in countries,that don't have it.,The ideal savanna landscape,is one of the clearest examples,where human beings everywhere,find beauty,in similar visual experience. 
 But, someone might argue,,that's natural beauty.,How about artistic beauty?,Isn't that exhaustively cultural?,No, I don't think it is.,And once again, I'd like to look back to prehistory,to say something about it.,It is widely assumed,that the earliest human artworks,are the stupendously skillful cave paintings,that we all know from Lascaux,and Chauvet.,Chauvet caves,are about 32,000 years old,,along with a few small, realistic sculptures,of women and animals from the same period.,But artistic and decorative skills,are actually much older than that.,Beautiful shell necklaces,that look like something you'd see at an arts and crafts fair,,as well as ochre body paint,,have been found,from around 100,000 years ago. 
 But the most intriguing prehistoric artifacts,are older even than this.,I have in mind,the so-called Acheulian hand axes.,The oldest stone tools are choppers,from the Olduvai Gorge in East Africa.,They go back about two-and-a-half-million years.,These crude tools,were around for thousands of centuries,,until around 1.4 million years ago,when Homo erectus,started shaping,single, thin stone blades,,sometimes rounded ovals,,but often in what are to our eyes,an arresting, symmetrical pointed leaf,or teardrop form.,These Acheulian hand axes --,they're named after St. Acheul in France,,where finds were made in 19th century --,have been unearthed in their thousands,,scattered across Asia, Europe and Africa,,almost everywhere Homo erectus,and Homo ergaster roamed.,Now, the sheer numbers of these hand axes,shows that they can't have been made,for butchering animals.,And the plot really thickens when you realize,that, unlike other pleistocene tools,,the hand axes often exhibit,no evidence of wear,on their delicate blade edges.,And some, in any event, are too big,to use for butchery.,Their symmetry, their attractive materials,and, above all,,their meticulous workmanship,are simply quite beautiful,to our eyes, even today. 
 So what were these ancient --,I mean, they're ancient, they're foreign,,but they're at the same time,somehow familiar.,What were these artifacts for?,The best available answer,is that they were literally,the earliest known works of art,,practical tools transformed,into captivating aesthetic objects,,contemplated both for their elegant shape,and their virtuoso craftsmanship.,Hand axes mark,an evolutionary advance in human history --,tools fashioned to function,as what Darwinians call "fitness signals" --,that is to say, displays,that are performances,like the peacock's tail,,except that, unlike hair and feathers,,the hand axes are consciously,cleverly crafted.,Competently made hand axes,indicated desirable personal qualities --,intelligence, fine motor control,,planning ability,,conscientiousness,and sometimes access to rare materials.,Over tens of thousands of generations,,such skills increased the status,of those who displayed them,and gained a reproductive advantage,over the less capable.,You know, it's an old line,,but it has been shown to work --,"Why don't you come up to my cave, so I can show you my hand axes?" 
 (Laughter) 
 Except, of course, what's interesting about this,is that we can't be sure how that idea was conveyed,,because the Homo erectus,that made these objects,did not have language.,It's hard to grasp,,but it's an incredible fact.,This object was made,by a hominid ancestor,,Homo erectus or Homo ergaster,,between 50,000 and 100,000 years,before language.,Stretching over a million years,,the hand axe tradition,is the longest artistic tradition,in human and proto-human history.,By the end of the hand axe epic, Homo sapiens --,as they were then called, finally --,were doubtless finding new ways,to amuse and amaze each other,by, who knows, telling jokes,,storytelling, dancing, or hairstyling.,Yes, hairstyling -- I insist on that. 
 For us moderns,,virtuoso technique,is used to create imaginary worlds,in fiction and in movies,,to express intense emotions,with music, painting and dance.,But still,,one fundamental trait,of the ancestral personality persists,in our aesthetic cravings:,the beauty we find,in skilled performances.,From Lascaux to the Louvre,to Carnegie Hall,,human beings,have a permanent innate taste,for virtuoso displays in the arts.,We find beauty,in something done well. 
 So the next time you pass a jewelry shop window,displaying a beautifully cut,teardrop-shaped stone,,don't be so sure,it's just your culture telling you,that that sparkling jewel is beautiful.,Your distant ancestors loved that shape,and found beauty in the skill needed to make it,,even before,they could put their love into words.,Is beauty in the eye of the beholder?,No, it's deep in our minds.,It's a gift handed down from the intelligent skills,and rich emotional lives,of our most ancient ancestors.,Our powerful reaction to images,,to the expression of emotion in art,,to the beauty of music, to the night sky,,will be with us and our descendants,for as long as the human race exists. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)About a year ago,,I asked myself a question:,"Knowing what I know,,why am I not a vegetarian?",After all, I'm one of the green guys:,I grew up with hippie parents in a log cabin.,I started a site called TreeHugger --,I care about this stuff.,I knew that eating a mere hamburger a day,can increase my risk of dying by a third.,Cruelty: I knew that the 10 billion,animals we raise each year for meat,are raised in factory farm conditions,that we, hypocritically, wouldn't even consider,for our own cats, dogs and other pets.,Environmentally, meat, amazingly,,causes more emissions,than all of transportation combined:,cars, trains, planes, buses, boats, all of it.,And beef production uses 100 times the water,that most vegetables do. 
 I also knew that I'm not alone.,We as a society,are eating twice as much meat,as we did in the 50s.,So what was once the special little side treat,now is the main, much more regular.,So really, any of these angles,should have been enough to convince me to go vegetarian.,Yet, there I was -- chk, chk, chk --,tucking into a big old steak. 
 So why was I stalling?,I realized that what I was being pitched,was a binary solution.,It was either,you're a meat eater or you're a vegetarian,,and I guess I just wasn't quite ready.,Imagine your last hamburger.,(Laughter),So my common sense,,my good intentions,,were in conflict with my taste buds.,And I'd commit to doing it later,,and not surprisingly, later never came.,Sound familiar? 
 So I wondered,,might there be a third solution?,And I thought about it, and I came up with one.,I've been doing it for the last year, and it's great.,It's called weekday veg.,The name says it all:,Nothing with a face Monday through Friday.,On the weekend, your choice.,Simple.,If you want to take it to the next level,,remember, the major culprits,in terms of environmental damage and health,are red and processed meats.,So you want to swap those out,with some good, sustainably harvested fish.,It's structured,,so it ends up being simple to remember,,and it's okay to break it here and there.,After all, cutting five days a week,is cutting 70 percent of your meat intake. 
 The program has been great, weekday veg.,My footprint's smaller,,I'm lessening pollution,,I feel better about the animals,,I'm even saving money.,Best of all, I'm healthier,,I know that I'm going to live longer,,and I've even lost a little weight. 
 So, please ask yourselves,,for your health,,for your pocketbook,,for the environment, for the animals:,What's stopping you from giving weekday veg a shot?,After all, if all of us,ate half as much meat,,it would be like half of us,were vegetarians. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)In Africa we say,,"God gave the white man a watch,and gave the black man time.",(Laughter),I think, how is it possible,for a man with so much time,to tell his story in 18 minutes?,I think it will be quite a challenge for me. 
 Most African stories these days,,they talk about famine,,HIV and AIDS,,poverty or war.,But my story that I would like to share with you today,is the one about success.,It is about a country,in the southwest of Africa,called Namibia.,Namibia has got 2.1 million people,,but it is only twice the size of California. 
 I come from a region,in the remote northwest part of the country.,It's called Kunene region.,And in the center of Kunene region,is the village of Sesfontein. This is where I was born.,This is where I'm coming from.,Most people that are following the story,of Angelina Jolie,and Brad Pitt,will know where Namibia is.,They love Namibia,for its beautiful dunes,,that are even taller,than the Empire State Building.,Wind and time have twisted our landscape,into very strange shapes,,and these shapes are speckled with wildlife,that has become so adapted,to this harsh and strange land. 
 I'm a Himba.,You might wonder, why are you wearing these Western clothes?,I'm a Himba and Namibian.,A Himba is one of the 29,ethnic groups in Namibia.,We live a very traditional lifestyle.,I grew up herding,,looking after our livestock --,goats, sheep and cattle.,And one day,,my father actually took me into the bush.,He said, "John,,I want you to become a good herder.,Boy, if you are looking after our livestock,and you see a cheetah,eating our goat --,cheetah is very nervous --,just walk up to it.,Walk up to it and smack it on the backside.",(Laughter),"And he will let go of the goat,and run off.",But then he said,,"Boy, if you run into a lion,,don't move.,Don't move. Stand your ground.,Puff up and just look it in the eye,and it may not want to fight you.",(Laughter),But then, he said,,"If you see a leopard,,boy, you better run like hell.",(Laughter),"Imagine you run faster than those goats you are looking after.",In this way --,(Laughter),In this way, I actually started to learn about nature. 
 In addition to being an ordinary Namibian,and in addition to being a Himba,I'm also a trained conservationist.,And it is very important if you are in the field,to know what to confront,and what to run from.,I was born in 1971.,We lived under apartheid regime.,The whites could farm, graze,and hunt as they wished,,but we black, we were not regarded as responsible,to use wildlife.,Whenever we tried to hunt,,we were called poachers.,And as a result, we were fined and locked up in jail. 
 Between 1966 and 1990,,the U.S. and Soviet interests,fought for control over my country.,And you know, during war time,,there are militaries, armies, that are moving around.,And the army hunted for valuable rhino horns,and tusks.,They could sell these things for anything between,$5,000 a kilo.,During the same year,almost every Himba had a rifle.,Because it was wartime,,the British .303 rifle,was just all over the whole country. 
 Then in the same time, around 1980,,we had a very big drought.,It killed almost everything that was left.,Our livestock was,almost at the brink of extinction,,protected as well.,We were hungry.,I remember a night,when a hungry leopard,went into the house,of one of our neighbors,and took a sleeping child out of the bed.,It's a very sad story.,But even today,,that memory is still in people's minds.,They can pinpoint the exact location,where this all happened.,And then, in the same year,,we almost lost everything.,And my father said, "Why don't you just go to school?",And they sent me off to school, just to get busy somewhere there. 
 And the year I went to school,,my father actually got a job with a non-governmental organization,called IRDNC, Integrated Rural Development and Nature Conservation.,They actually spend a lot of time a year in the communities.,They were trusted by the local communities,like our leader, Joshua Kangombe.,Joshua Kangombe saw what was happening:,wildlife disappearing,,poaching was skyrocketing,,and the situation seemed very hopeless.,Death and despair surrounded Joshua,and our entire communities. 
 But then, the people from IRDNC proposed to Joshua:,What if we pay people that you trust,to look after wildlife?,Do you have anybody in your communities, or people,,that know the bush very well,and that know wildlife very well?,The headman said: "Yes. Our poachers.","Eh? The poachers?","Yes. Our poachers.",And that was my father.,My father has been a poacher for quite a long time.,Instead of shooting poachers dead,like they were doing elsewhere in Africa,,IRDNC has helped men reclaim their abilities,to manage their peoples,and their rights to own and manage wildlife.,And thus, as people started feeling ownership over wildlife,,wildlife numbers started coming back,,and that's actually becoming a foundation for conservation in Namibia.,With independence, the whole approach of community getting involved,was embraced by our new government. 
 Three things that actually help to build on this foundation:,The very first one is,honoring of tradition and being open to new ideas.,Here is our tradition:,At every Himba village, there is a sacred fire.,And at this sacred fire, the spirit of our ancestors,speak through the headman,and advise us where to get water,,where to get grazings,,and where to go and hunt.,And I think this is the best way of regulating ourselves,on the environment.,And here are the new ideas.,Transporting rhinos using helicopters,I think is much easier,than talking through a spirit that you can't see, isn't it?,And these things we were taught by outsiders.,We learned these things from outsiders.,We needed new boundaries to describe our traditional lands;,we needed to learn more things like GPS,just to see whether --,can GPS really reflect the true reflection of the land,or is this just a thing made somewhere in the West?,And we then wanted to see whether we can match our,ancestral maps with digital maps made somewhere in the world.,And through this,,we actually started realizing our dreams,,and we maintained honoring our traditions,but we were still open to new ideas. 
 The second element is that we wanted to have a life,,a better life where we can benefit through many things.,Most poachers, like my father,,were people from our own community.,They were not people from outside.,These were our own people.,And sometimes, once they were caught,,they were treated with respect, brought back into the communities,and they were made part of the bigger dreams.,The best one, like my father -- I'm not campaigning for my father --,(Laughter),they were put in charge to stop others from poaching.,And when this thing started going on,,we started becoming one community,,renewing our connection to nature.,And that was a very strong thing in Namibia. 
 The last element that actually helped develop these things,was the partnerships.,Our government has given legal status over our traditional lands.,The other partners that we have got,is business communities.,Business communities helped bring Namibia onto the world map,and they have also helped make wildlife,a very valuable land use like any other land uses,such as agriculture.,And most of my conservation colleagues today,that you find in Namibia,have been trained through the initiative,,through the involvement of World Wildlife Fund,in the most up-to-date conservation practices.,They have also given funding for two decades,to this whole program.,And so far, with the support of World Wildlife Fund,,we've been able to scale up the very small programs,to national programs today.,Namibia ... or Sesfontein,was no more an isolated village somewhere,,hidden away in Namibia.,With these assets we are now part of the global village. 
 Thirty years have passed,since my father's first job as a community game guard.,It's very unfortunate that he passed away and he cannot see the success,as I and my children see it today.,When I finished school in 1995,,there were only 20 lions in the entire Northwest -- in our area.,But today, there are more than 130 lions.,(Applause),So please, if you go to Namibia,,make sure that you stay in the tents.,Don't walk out at night! 
 (Laughter) 
 The black rhino -- they were almost extinct in 1982.,But today, Kunene has the largest concentration of black rhino --,free-roaming black rhinos -- in the world.,This is outside the protected area. 
 (Applause) 
 The leopard -- they are now in big numbers,but they are now far away from our village,,because the natural plain has multiplied,,like zebras, springboks and everything.,They stay very much far away,because this other thing has multiplied,from less than a thousand to tens of thousands of animals. 
 What started as very small,,community rangers getting community involved,,has now grown into something that we call conservancies.,Conservancies are legally instituted institutions,by the government,,and these are run by the communities themselves, for their benefit.,Today, we have got 60 conservancies,that manage and protect over 13 million hectares,of land in Namibia.,We have already reshaped conservation in the entire country.,Nowhere else in the world,has community-adopted conservation at this scale. 
 (Applause) 
 In 2008, conservancy generated 5.7 million dollars.,This is our new economy --,an economy based on the respect of our natural resources.,And we are able to use this money for many things:,Very importantly, we put it in education.,Secondly, we put it for infrastructure. Food.,Very important as well -- we invest this money in AIDS and HIV education.,You know that Africa is being affected by these viruses.,And this is the good news from Africa,that we have to shout from the rooftops. 
 (Applause) 
 And now, what the world really needs,is for you to help me and our partners,take some of what we have learned in Namibia,to other places with similar problems:,places like Mongolia,,or even in your own backyards,,the Northern Great Plains,,where buffalo and other animals have suffered,and many communities are in decline.,I like that one:,Namibia serving as a model to Africa,,and Africa serving as a model to the United States.,(Applause),We were successful in Namibia,because we dreamed of a future,that was much more than just a healthy wildlife.,We knew conservation would fail,if it doesn't work to improve the lives of the local communities.,So, come and talk to me about Namibia,,and better yet, come to Namibia,and see for yourself how we have done it.,And please, do visit our website,to learn more and see how you can help CBNRM,in Africa and across the world.,Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)If you go on the TED website,,you can currently find there,over a full week of TEDTalk videos,,over 1.3 million,words of transcripts,and millions of user ratings.,And that's a huge amount of data.,And it got me wondering:,If you took all this data,and put it through statistical analysis,,could you reverse engineer a TEDTalk?,Could you create,the ultimate TEDTalk?,(Laughter) (Applause),And also, could you create,the worst possible TEDTalk,that they would still let you get away with? 
 To find this out, I looked at three things:,I looked at the topic that you should choose,,I looked at how you should deliver it,and the visuals onstage.,Now, with the topic: There's a whole range of topics you can choose,,but you should choose wisely,,because your topic strongly correlates,with how users will react to your talk.,Now, to make this more concrete,,let's look at the list of top 10 words,that statistically stick out,in the most favorite TEDTalks,and in the least favorite TEDTalks.,So if you came here,to talk about how French coffee,will spread happiness in our brains,,that's a go.,(Laughter) (Applause),Whereas, if you wanted to talk about,your project involving,oxygen, girls, aircraft --,actually, I would like to hear that talk, (Laughter),but statistics say it's not so good.,Oh, well.,If you generalize this,,the most favorite TEDTalks are those,that feature topics we can connect with,,both easily and deeply,,such as happiness, our own body,,food, emotions.,And the more technical topics,,such as architecture, materials and, strangely enough, men,,those are not good topics to talk about. 
 How should you deliver your talk?,TED is famous for keeping,a very sharp eye on the clock,,so they're going to hate me,for revealing this, because, actually,,you should talk as long as they will let you. (Laughter),Because the most favorite TEDTalks,are, on average, over 50 percent longer,than the least favorite ones.,And this holds true for all ranking lists on TED.com,except if you want to have a talk,that's beautiful, inspiring or funny.,Then, you should be brief. (Laughter) But other than that,,talk until they drag you off the stage. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, while ...,(Applause),While you're pushing the clock, there's a few rules to obey.,I found these rules out by comparing the statistics,of four-word phrases,that appear more often in the most favorite TEDTalks,as opposed to the least favorite TEDTalks.,I'll give you three examples.,First of all, I must, as a speaker,,provide a service to the audience and talk about what I will give you,,instead of saying what I can't have.,Secondly, it's imperative,that you do not cite The New York Times.,(Laughter),And finally, it's okay for the speaker -- that's the good news --,to fake intellectual capacity.,If I don't understand something, I can just say, "etc., etc.",You'll all stay with me.,It's perfectly fine.,(Applause) 
 Now, let's go to the visuals.,The most obvious visual thing on stage is the speaker.,And analysis shows if you want to be,among the most favorite TED speakers,,you should let your hair grow a little bit longer than average,,make sure you wear your glasses and be slightly more dressed-up,than the average TED speaker.,Slides are okay, though you might consider going for props.,And now the most important thing,,that is the mood onstage.,Color plays a very important role.,Color closely correlates,with the ratings that talks get on the website.,(Applause),For example, fascinating talks,contain a statistically high amount,of exactly this blue color, (Laughter),much more than the average TEDTalk.,Ingenious TEDTalks, much more this green color,,etc., et.,(Laughter) (Applause),Now, personally, I think,I'm not the first one who has done this analysis,,but I'll leave this,to your good judgment. 
 So, now it's time to put it all together,and design the ultimate TEDTalk.,Now, since this is TEDActive,,and I learned from my analysis,that I should actually give you something,,I will not impose the ultimate,or worst TEDTalk on you,,but rather give you a tool to create your own.,And I call this tool the TEDPad.,(Laughter),And the TEDPad is a matrix,of 100 specifically selected,,highly curated sentences,that you can easily piece together to get your own TEDTalk.,You only have to make one decision,,and that is: Are you going to use the white version,for very good TEDTalks,,about creativity, human genius?,Or are you going to go with a black version,,which will allow you to create really bad TEDTalks,,mostly about blogs,,politics and stuff?,So, download it and have fun with it. 
 Now I hope you enjoy the session.,I hope you enjoy designing your own,ultimate and worst possible TEDTalks.,And I hope some of you will be inspired for next year,to create this, which I really want to see. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) Thanks.So, if you're in the audience today,,or maybe you're watching this talk in some other time or place,,you are a participant in the digital rights ecosystem.,Whether you're an artist, a technologist,,a lawyer or a fan,,the handling of copyright directly impacts your life.,Rights management is no longer,simply a question of ownership,,it's a complex web of relationships,and a critical part of our cultural landscape.,YouTube cares deeply about the rights of content owners,,but in order to give them choices about what they can do,with copies, mashups and more,,we need to first identify,when copyrighted material is uploaded to our site. 
 Let's look at a specific video so you can see how it works.,Two years ago, recording artist Chris Brown,released the official video of his single "Forever.",A fan saw it on TV,,recorded it with her camera phone,,and uploaded it to YouTube.,Because Sony Music had registered Chris Brown's video,in our Content ID system,,within seconds of attempting to upload the video,,the copy was detected,,giving Sony the choice of what to do next. 
 But how do we know that the user's video was a copy?,Well, it starts with content owners,delivering assets into our database,,along with a usage policy,that tells us what to do when we find a match.,We compare each upload,against all of the reference files in our database.,This heat map is going to show you,how the brain of the system works.,Here we can see the original reference file,being compared to the user generated content.,The system compares every moment,of one to the other to see if there's a match.,This means that we can identify a match,even if the copy used is just a portion of the original file,,plays it in slow motion,and has degraded audio and video quality.,And we do this every time,that a video is uploaded to YouTube.,And that's over 20 hours of video every minute.,When we find a match,,we apply the policy that the rights owner has set down. 
 And the scale and the speed of this system,is truly breathtaking.,We're not just talking about a few videos,,we're talking about over,100 years of video every day,,between new uploads and the legacy scans,we regularly do across all of the content on the site.,When we compare those hundred years of video,,we're comparing it against millions,of reference files in our database.,It would be like 36,000 people,staring at 36,000 monitors,each and every day, without so much as a coffee break. 
 Now, what do we do when we find a match?,Well, most rights owners, instead of blocking,,will allow the copy to be published.,And then they benefit through the exposure,,advertising and linked sales.,Remember Chris Brown's video "Forever"?,Well, it had its day in the sun and then it dropped off the charts,,and that looked like the end of the story,,but sometime last year, a young couple got married.,This is their wedding video.,You may have seen it. 
 (Music) 
 What's amazing about this is,,if the processional of the wedding was this much fun,,can you imagine how much fun the reception must have been?,I mean, who are these people?,I totally want to go to that wedding. 
 So their little wedding video went on,to get over 40 million views.,And instead of Sony blocking,,they allowed the upload to occur.,And they put advertising against it,and linked from it to iTunes.,And the song, 18 months old,,went back to number four on the iTunes charts.,So Sony is generating revenue from both of these.,And Jill and Kevin, the happy couple,,they came back from their honeymoon,and found that their video had gone crazy viral.,And they've ended up on a bunch of talk shows,,and they've used it as an opportunity to make a difference.,The video's inspired over 26,000 dollars in donations,to end domestic violence.,The "JK Wedding [Entrance] Dance" became so popular,that NBC parodied it on the season finale of "The Office,",which just goes to show,,it's truly an ecosystem of culture.,Because it's not just amateurs borrowing from big studios,,but sometimes big studios borrowing back. 
 By empowering choice, we can create a culture of opportunity.,And all it took to change things around,was to allow for choice through rights identification.,So why has no one ever solved this problem before?,It's because it's a big problem,,and it's complicated and messy.,It's not uncommon for a single video,to have multiple rights owners.,There's musical labels.,There's multiple music publishers.,And each of these can vary by country.,There's lots of cases,where we have more than one work mashed together.,So we have to manage many claims,to the same video. 
 YouTube's Content ID system addresses all of these cases.,But the system only works through,the participation of rights owners.,If you have content that others are uploading to YouTube,,you should register in the Content ID system,,and then you'll have the choice,about how your content is used.,And think carefully about the policies that you attach to that content.,By simply blocking all reuse,,you'll miss out on new art forms,,new audiences,,new distribution channels,and new revenue streams. 
 But it's not just about dollars and impressions.,Just look at all the joy,that was spread through progressive rights management,and new technology.,And I think we can all agree that joy is definitely an idea worth spreading. 
 Thank you.,(Applause)So since I was here last in '06,,we discovered that global climate change,is turning out to be a pretty serious issue,,so we covered that fairly extensively,in Skeptic magazine.,We investigate all kinds,of scientific and quasi-scientific controversies,,but it turns out we don't have to worry about any of this,because the world's going to end in 2012. 
 Another update:,You will recall I introduced you guys,to the Quadro Tracker.,It's like a water dowsing device.,It's just a hollow piece of plastic with an antenna that swivels around.,And you walk around, and it points to things.,Like if you're looking for marijuana in students' lockers,,it'll point right to somebody.,Oh, sorry. (Laughter),This particular one that was given to me,finds golf balls,,especially if you're at a golf course,and you check under enough bushes.,Well, under the category of "What's the harm of silly stuff like this?",this device, the ADE 651,,was sold to the Iraqi government,for 40,000 dollars apiece.,It's just like this one, completely worthless,,in which it allegedly worked by "electrostatic,magnetic ion attraction,",which translates to,"pseudoscientific baloney" -- would be the nice word --,in which you string together a bunch of words that sound good,,but it does absolutely nothing.,In this case, at trespass points,,allowing people to go through,because your little tracker device said they were okay,,actually cost lives.,So there is a danger to pseudoscience,,in believing in this sort of thing. 
 So what I want to talk about today is belief.,I want to believe,,and you do too.,And in fact, I think my thesis here is that,belief is the natural state of things.,It is the default option. We just believe.,We believe all sorts of things.,Belief is natural;,disbelief, skepticism, science, is not natural.,It's more difficult.,It's uncomfortable to not believe things.,So like Fox Mulder on "X-Files,",who wants to believe in UFOs? Well, we all do,,and the reason for that is because,we have a belief engine in our brains.,Essentially, we are pattern-seeking primates.,We connect the dots: A is connected to B; B is connected to C.,And sometimes A really is connected to B,,and that's called association learning. 
 We find patterns, we make those connections,,whether it's Pavlov's dog here,associating the sound of the bell with the food,,and then he salivates to the sound of the bell,,or whether it's a Skinnerian rat,,in which he's having an association,between his behavior and a reward for it,,and therefore he repeats the behavior.,In fact, what Skinner discovered,is that, if you put a pigeon in a box like this,,and he has to press one of these two keys,,and he tries to figure out what the pattern is,,and you give him a little reward in the hopper box there --,if you just randomly assign rewards,such that there is no pattern,,they will figure out any kind of pattern.,And whatever they were doing just before they got the reward,,they repeat that particular pattern.,Sometimes it was even spinning around twice counterclockwise,,once clockwise and peck the key twice.,And that's called superstition,,and that, I'm afraid,,we will always have with us. 
 I call this process "patternicity" --,that is, the tendency to find meaningful patterns,in both meaningful and meaningless noise.,When we do this process, we make two types of errors.,A Type I error, or false positive,,is believing a pattern is real,when it's not.,Our second type of error is a false negative.,A Type II error is not believing,a pattern is real when it is.,So let's do a thought experiment.,You are a hominid three million years ago,walking on the plains of Africa.,Your name is Lucy, okay?,And you hear a rustle in the grass.,Is it a dangerous predator,,or is it just the wind?,Your next decision could be the most important one of your life.,Well, if you think that the rustle in the grass is a dangerous predator,and it turns out it's just the wind,,you've made an error in cognition,,made a Type I error, false positive.,But no harm. You just move away.,You're more cautious. You're more vigilant.,On the other hand, if you believe that the rustle in the grass is just the wind,,and it turns out it's a dangerous predator,,you're lunch.,You've just won a Darwin award.,You've been taken out of the gene pool. 
 Now the problem here is that,patternicities will occur whenever the cost,of making a Type I error,is less than the cost of making a Type II error.,This is the only equation in the talk by the way.,We have a pattern detection problem,that is assessing the difference between a Type I and a Type II error,is highly problematic,,especially in split-second, life-and-death situations.,So the default position,is just: Believe all patterns are real --,All rustles in the grass are dangerous predators,and not just the wind.,And so I think that we evolved ...,there was a natural selection for the propensity for our belief engines,,our pattern-seeking brain processes,,to always find meaningful patterns,and infuse them with these sort of,predatory or intentional agencies that I'll come back to. 
 So for example, what do you see here?,It's a horse head, that's right.,It looks like a horse. It must be a horse.,That's a pattern.,And is it really a horse?,Or is it more like a frog?,See, our pattern detection device,,which appears to be located in the anterior cingulate cortex --,it's our little detection device there --,can be easily fooled, and this is the problem.,For example, what do you see here?,Yes, of course, it's a cow.,Once I prime the brain -- it's called cognitive priming --,once I prime the brain to see it,,it pops back out again even without the pattern that I've imposed on it.,And what do you see here?,Some people see a Dalmatian dog.,Yes, there it is. And there's the prime.,So when I go back without the prime,,your brain already has the model,so you can see it again.,What do you see here?,Planet Saturn. Yes, that's good.,How about here?,Just shout out anything you see.,That's a good audience, Chris.,Because there's nothing in this. Well, allegedly there's nothing. 
 This is an experiment done by Jennifer Whitson,at U.T. Austin,on corporate environments,and whether feelings of uncertainty and out of control,makes people see illusory patterns.,That is, almost everybody sees the planet Saturn.,People that are put in a condition of feeling out of control,are more likely to see something in this,,which is allegedly patternless.,In other words, the propensity to find these patterns,goes up when there's a lack of control.,For example, baseball players are notoriously superstitious,when they're batting,,but not so much when they're fielding.,Because fielders are successful,90 to 95 percent of the time.,The best batters fail seven out of 10 times.,So their superstitions, their patternicities,,are all associated with feelings of lack of control,and so forth. 
 What do you see in this particular one here, in this field?,Anybody see an object there?,There actually is something here,,but it's degraded.,While you're thinking about that,,this was an experiment done by Susan Blackmore,,a psychologist in England,,who showed subjects this degraded image,and then ran a correlation between,their scores on an ESP test:,How much did they believe in the paranormal,,supernatural, angels and so forth.,And those who scored high on the ESP scale,,tended to not only see,more patterns in the degraded images,but incorrect patterns.,Here is what you show subjects.,The fish is degraded 20 percent, 50 percent,and then the one I showed you,,70 percent. 
 A similar experiment was done by another [Swiss] psychologist,named Peter Brugger,,who found significantly more meaningful patterns,were perceived on the right hemisphere,,via the left visual field, than the left hemisphere.,So if you present subjects the images such,that it's going to end up on the right hemisphere instead of the left,,then they're more likely to see patterns,than if you put it on the left hemisphere.,Our right hemisphere appears to be,where a lot of this patternicity occurs.,So what we're trying to do is bore into the brain,to see where all this happens. 
 Brugger and his colleague, Christine Mohr,,gave subjects L-DOPA.,L-DOPA's a drug, as you know, given for treating Parkinson's disease,,which is related to a decrease in dopamine.,L-DOPA increases dopamine.,An increase of dopamine caused,subjects to see more patterns,than those that did not receive the dopamine.,So dopamine appears to be the drug,associated with patternicity.,In fact, neuroleptic drugs,that are used to eliminate psychotic behavior,,things like paranoia, delusions,and hallucinations,,these are patternicities.,They're incorrect patterns. They're false positives. They're Type I errors.,And if you give them drugs,that are dopamine antagonists,,they go away.,That is, you decrease the amount of dopamine,,and their tendency to see,patterns like that decreases.,On the other hand, amphetamines like cocaine,are dopamine agonists.,They increase the amount of dopamine.,So you're more likely to feel in a euphoric state,,creativity, find more patterns. 
 In fact, I saw Robin Williams recently,talk about how he thought he was much funnier,when he was doing cocaine, when he had that issue, than now.,So perhaps more dopamine,is related to more creativity.,Dopamine, I think, changes,our signal-to-noise ratio.,That is, how accurate we are,in finding patterns.,If it's too low, you're more likely to make too many Type II errors.,You miss the real patterns. You don't want to be too skeptical.,If you're too skeptical, you'll miss the really interesting good ideas.,Just right, you're creative, and yet you don't fall for too much baloney.,Too high and maybe you see patterns everywhere.,Every time somebody looks at you, you think people are staring at you.,You think people are talking about you.,And if you go too far on that, that's just simply,labeled as madness.,It's a distinction perhaps we might make,between two Nobel laureates, Richard Feynman,and John Nash.,One sees maybe just the right number,of patterns to win a Nobel Prize.,The other one also, but maybe too many patterns.,And we then call that schizophrenia. 
 So the signal-to-noise ratio then presents us with a pattern-detection problem.,And of course you all know exactly,what this is, right?,And what pattern do you see here?,Again, I'm putting your anterior cingulate cortex to the test here,,causing you conflicting pattern detections.,You know, of course, this is Via Uno shoes.,These are sandals.,Pretty sexy feet, I must say.,Maybe a little Photoshopped.,And of course, the ambiguous figures,that seem to flip-flop back and forth.,It turns out what you're thinking about a lot,influences what you,tend to see.,And you see the lamp here, I know.,Because the lights on here.,Of course, thanks to the environmentalist movement,we're all sensitive to the plight of marine mammals.,So what you see in this particular ambiguous figure,is, of course, the dolphins, right?,You see a dolphin here,,and there's a dolphin,,and there's a dolphin.,That's a dolphin tail there, guys. 
 (Laughter) 
 If we can give you conflicting data, again,,your ACC is going to be going into hyperdrive.,If you look down here, it's fine. If you look up here, then you get conflicting data.,And then we have to flip the image,for you to see that it's a set up.,The impossible crate illusion.,It's easy to fool the brain in 2D.,So you say, "Aw, come on Shermer, anybody can do that,in a Psych 101 text with an illusion like that.",Well here's the late, great Jerry Andrus',"impossible crate" illusion in 3D,,in which Jerry is standing inside,the impossible crate.,And he was kind enough to post this,and give us the reveal.,Of course, camera angle is everything. The photographer is over there,,and this board appears to overlap with this one, and this one with that one, and so on.,But even when I take it away,,the illusion is so powerful because of how are brains are wired,to find those certain kinds of patterns. 
 This is a fairly new one,that throws us off because of the conflicting patterns,of comparing this angle with that angle.,In fact, it's the exact same picture side by side.,So what you're doing is comparing that angle,instead of with this one, but with that one.,And so your brain is fooled.,Yet again, your pattern detection devices are fooled. 
 Faces are easy to see,because we have an additional evolved,facial recognition software,in our temporal lobes.,Here's some faces on the side of a rock.,I'm actually not even sure if this is -- this might be Photoshopped.,But anyway, the point is still made.,Now which one of these looks odd to you?,In a quick reaction, which one looks odd?,The one on the left. Okay. So I'll rotate it,so it'll be the one on the right.,And you are correct.,A fairly famous illusion -- it was first done with Margaret Thatcher.,Now, they trade up the politicians every time.,Well, why is this happening?,Well, we know exactly where it happens,,in the temporal lobe, right across, sort of above your ear there,,in a little structure called the fusiform gyrus.,And there's two types of cells that do this,,that record facial features either globally,,or specifically these large, rapid-firing cells,,first look at the general face.,So you recognize Obama immediately.,And then you notice something quite,a little bit odd about the eyes and the mouth.,Especially when they're upside down,,you're engaging that general facial recognition software there. 
 Now I said back in our little thought experiment,,you're a hominid walking on the plains of Africa.,Is it just the wind or a dangerous predator?,What's the difference between those?,Well, the wind is inanimate;,the dangerous predator is an intentional agent.,And I call this process agenticity.,That is the tendency to infuse patterns,with meaning, intention and agency,,often invisible beings from the top down.,This is an idea that we got,from a fellow TEDster here, Dan Dennett,,who talked about taking the intentional stance. 
 So it's a type of that expanded to explain, I think, a lot of different things:,souls, spirits, ghosts, gods, demons, angels,,aliens, intelligent designers,,government conspiracists,and all manner of invisible agents,with power and intention, are believed,to haunt our world and control our lives.,I think it's the basis of animism,and polytheism and monotheism.,It's the belief that aliens are somehow,more advanced than us, more moral than us,,and the narratives always are,that they're coming here to save us and rescue us from on high.,The intelligent designer's always portrayed,as this super intelligent, moral being,that comes down to design life.,Even the idea that government can rescue us --,that's no longer the wave of the future,,but that is, I think, a type of agenticity:,projecting somebody up there,,big and powerful, will come rescue us. 
 And this is also, I think, the basis of conspiracy theories.,There's somebody hiding behind there pulling the strings,,whether it's the Illuminati,or the Bilderbergers.,But this is a pattern detection problem, isn't it?,Some patterns are real and some are not.,Was JFK assassinated by a conspiracy or by a lone assassin?,Well, if you go there -- there's people there on any given day --,like when I went there, here -- showing me where the different shooters were.,My favorite one was he was in the manhole.,And he popped out at the last second, took that shot.,But of course, Lincoln was assassinated by a conspiracy.,So we can't just uniformly dismiss,all patterns like that.,Because, let's face it, some patterns are real.,Some conspiracies really are true.,Explains a lot, maybe. 
 And 9/11 has a conspiracy theory. It is a conspiracy.,We did a whole issue on it.,Nineteen members of Al Queda plotting to fly planes into buildings,constitutes a conspiracy.,But that's not what the "9/11 truthers" think.,They think it was an inside job by the Bush administration.,Well, that's a whole other lecture.,You know how we know that 9/11,was not orchestrated by the Bush administration?,Because it worked. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 So we are natural-born dualists.,Our agenticity process comes from,the fact that we can enjoy movies like these.,Because we can imagine, in essence,,continuing on.,We know that if you stimulate the temporal lobe,,you can produce a feeling of out-of-body experiences,,near-death experiences,,which you can do by just touching an electrode to the temporal lobe there.,Or you can do it through loss of consciousness,,by accelerating in a centrifuge.,You get a hypoxia, or a lower oxygen.,And the brain then senses,that there's an out-of-body experience.,You can use -- which I did, went out and did --,Michael Persinger's God Helmet,,that bombards your temporal lobes with electromagnetic waves.,And you get a sense of out-of-body experience. 
 So I'm going to end here with a short video clip,that sort of brings all this together.,It's just a minute and a half.,It ties together all this into the power of expectation and the power of belief.,Go ahead and roll it. 
 Narrator: This is the venue they chose for their fake auditions,for an advert for lip balm. 
 Woman: We're hoping we can use part of this,in a national commercial, right?,And this is test on some lip balms,that we have over here.,And these are our models who are going to help us,,Roger and Matt.,And we have our own lip balm,,and we have a leading brand.,Would you have any problem,kissing our models to test it? 
 Girl: No. 
 Woman: You wouldn't? (Girl: No.) Woman: You'd think that was fine. 
 Girl: That would be fine. (Woman: Okay.) 
 So this is a blind test.,I'm going to ask you to go ahead,and put a blindfold on.,Kay, now can you see anything? (Girl: No.),Pull it so you can't even see down. (Girl: Okay.) 
 Woman: It's completely blind now, right? 
 Girl: Yes. (Woman: Okay.) 
 Now, what I'm going to be looking for in this test,is how it protects your lips,,the texture, right,,and maybe if you can discern any flavor or not. 
 Girl: Okay. (Woman: Have you ever done a kissing test before?) 
 Girl: No. 
 Woman: Take a step here.,Okay, now I'm going to ask you to pucker up.,Pucker up big and lean in just a little bit, okay? 
 (Music) 
 (Laughter) 
 (Laughter) 
 Woman: Okay.,And, Jennifer, how did that feel? 
 Jennifer: Good. 
 (Laughter) 
 Girl: Oh my God! 
 (Laughter) 
 Michael Shermer: Thank you very much. Thank you. Thanks.One of the things that,defines a TEDster,is you've taken your passion,,and you've turned it into stewardship.,You actually put action to the issues you care about.,But what you're going to find eventually is,you may need to actually get elected officials,to help you out.,So, how do you do that? 
 One of the things I should probably tell you is,,I worked for the Discovery Channel early in my career,,and that sort of warped my framework.,So, when you start to think about politicians,,you've got to realize these are strange creatures.,Other than the fact that they can't tell directions,,and they have very strange breeding habits,,how do you actually work with these things? (Laughter),What we need to understand is:,What drives the political creature?,And there are two things that are primary in a politician's heart:,One is reputation and influence.,These are the primary tools by which,a politician can do his job.,The second one -- unlike most animals,,which is survival of the species --,this is preservation of self.,Now you may think it's money,,but that's actually sort of a proxy,to what I can do to preserve myself. 
 Now, the challenge with you moving your issue forward,is these animals are getting broadcast to all the time.,So, what doesn't work, in terms of getting your issue to be important?,You can send them an email.,Well, unfortunately, I've got so many,Viagra ads coming at me,,your email is lost.,It doesn't matter, it's spam.,How about you get on the phone?,Well, chances are I've got a droid who's picking up the phone,,"Yes, they called, and they said they didn't like it.",That doesn't move.,Face to face would work,,but it's hard to set it up.,It's hard to get the context and actually get the communication to work.,Yes, contributions actually do make a difference,and they set a context for having a conversation,,but it takes some time to build up. 
 So what actually works?,And the answer is rather strange.,It's a letter.,We live in a digital world,,but we're fairly analog creatures.,Letters actually work.,Even the top dog himself,takes time every day to read 10 letters,that are picked out by staff.,I can tell you that every official that I've ever worked with,will tell you about the letters they get,and what they mean.,So, how are you going to write your letter?,First of all, you're going to pick up an analog device: a pen.,I know these are tough, and you may have a hard time,getting your hand bent around it, (Laughter),but this is actually critical.,And it is critical that,you actually handwrite your letter.,It is so novel to see this,,that somebody actually picked up an analog device,and has written to me.,Second of all, I'm going to recommend that,you get into a proactive stance,and write to your elected officials at least once a month.,Here's my promise to you:,If you are consistent and do this,,within three months the elected official will start calling you,when that issue comes up and say, "What do you think?" 
 Now, I'm going to give you,a four paragraph format to work with.,Now, when you approach these animals,,you need to understand there's a dangerous end to them,,and you also need to approach them,with some level of respect and a little bit of wariness.,So in paragraph number one,,what I'm going to tell you to do is very simply this:,You appreciate them.,You may not appreciate the person, you may not appreciate anything else,,but maybe you appreciate the fact that they've got a tough gig.,When animals are going to make a point, they make the point.,They don't spend a lot of time dicking around.,So, here you go. (Laughter),Paragraph number two:,You may actually have to just get very blunt,and say what's really on your mind.,When you do this,,don't attack people;,you attack tactics.,Ad hominem attacks will get you nowhere.,Paragraph number three:,When animals are attacked or cornered,,they will fight to the death,,so you have to give them an exit.,Most of the time, if they have an exit strategy, they should take it.,"Obviously, you're intelligent.,If you had the right information,,you would have done the right thing." (Laughter),Lastly, you want to be the nurturing agent.,You're the safe place to come in to.,So, in paragraph number four,,you're going to tell people,,"If no one is providing you with this information, let me help." (Laughter) 
 Animals do displays. They do two things:,They warn you or they try to attract you,and say, "We need to mate.",You're going to do that by the way you sign your letter.,You do a number of things: you're a vice president,,you volunteer, you do something else.,Why is is this important?,Because this establishes the two,primary criteria for the political creature:,that you have influence in a large sphere,,and that my preservation depends on you. 
 Here is one very quick hack,,especially for the feds in the audience.,Here's how you mail your letter.,First of all, you send the original to the district office.,So, you send the copy to the main office.,If they follow protocol, they'll pick up the phone and say, "Hey, do you have the original?",Then some droid in the back puts the name on a tickler,and says, "Oh, this is an important letter.",And you actually get into the folder,that the elected official actually has to read. 
 So, what your letter means:,I've got to tell you, we are all in a party,,and political officials are the pinatas.,(Laughter),We are harangued, lectured to,,sold, marketed,,but a letter is actually one of the few times,that we have honest communication.,I got this letter when I was first elected,,and I still carry it to,every council meeting I go to.,This is an opportunity at real dialogue,,and if you have stewardship,and want to communicate,,that dialogue is incredibly powerful.,So when you do that, here's what I can promise:,You're going to be the 800 pound gorilla in the forest. 
 Get writing. 
 (Applause)I've been playing TED for nearly a decade,,and I've very rarely played,any new songs of my own.,And that was largely because there weren't any. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I've been busy with a couple of projects,,and one of them was this:,The Nutmeg.,A 1930s ship's lifeboat,,which I've been restoring in the garden,of my beach house in England.,And, so now,,when the polar ice caps melt,,my recording studio will rise up like an ark,,and I'll float off into the drowned world,like a character from a J.G. Ballard novel.,During the day,,the Nutmeg collects energy,from solar panels on the roof of the wheelhouse,,and from a 450 watt turbine,up the mast.,So that when it gets dark,,I've got plenty of power.,And I can light up the Nutmeg like a beacon.,And so I go in there until the early hours of the morning,,and I work on new songs.,I'd like to play to you guys,,if you're willing to be the first audience to hear it. 
 (Applause) 
 It's about Billie Holiday.,And it appears that,,some night in 1947,she left her physical space,and was missing all night,,until she reappeared in the morning.,But I know where she was.,She was with me on my lifeboat.,And she was hot.

 (Applause)One day, Los Angeles Times columnist,Steve Lopez was walking along,the streets of downtown Los Angeles,when he heard beautiful music.,And the source was a man,,an African-American man,,charming, rugged, homeless,,playing a violin that only had two strings. 
 And I'm telling a story that many of you know,,because Steve's columns became the basis,for a book, which was turned into a movie,,with Robert Downey Jr. acting as Steve Lopez,,and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers,,the Juilliard-trained double bassist,whose promising career was cut short,by a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia.,Nathaniel dropped out of Juilliard, he suffered a complete breakdown,,and 30 years later he was living homeless,on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles.,I encourage all of you to read Steve's book or to watch the movie,to understand not only the beautiful bond,that formed between these two men,,but how music helped shape that bond,,and ultimately was instrumental -- if you'll pardon the pun --,in helping Nathaniel get off the streets. 
 I met Mr. Ayers in 2008,,two years ago, at Walt Disney Concert Hall.,He had just heard a performance of Beethoven's First and Fourth symphonies,,and came backstage and introduced himself.,He was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way,about Yo-Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton,and how the Dodgers were never going to make the World Series,,all because of the treacherous first violin passage work,in the last movement of Beethoven's Fourth Symphony.,And we got talking about music, and I got an email from Steve a few days later,saying that Nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me. 
 Now, I should mention that Nathaniel refuses treatment,because when he was treated it was with shock therapy,and Thorazine and handcuffs,,and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life.,But as a result now, he is prone to,these schizophrenic episodes,,the worst of which can manifest themselves as,him exploding,and then disappearing for days,,wandering the streets of Skid Row,,exposed to its horrors, with the torment of his own mind,unleashed upon him. 
 And Nathaniel was in such a state of agitation,when we started our first lesson at Walt Disney Concert Hall --,he had a kind of manic glint in his eyes,,he was lost.,And he was talking about,invisible demons and smoke,,and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep. 
 And I was afraid,,not for myself, but I was afraid,that I was going to lose him,,that he was going to sink into one of his states,,and that I would ruin his relationship with the violin,if I started talking about scales,and arpeggios and other exciting forms of,didactic violin pedagogy.,(Laughter),So, I just started playing.,And I played the first movement of the Beethoven Violin Concerto. 
 And as I played,,I understood that there was a profound change,occurring in Nathaniel's eyes.,It was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical,,a chemical reaction, for which my playing the music,was its catalyst.,And Nathaniel's manic rage,was transformed into understanding,,a quiet curiosity and grace.,And in a miracle, he lifted his own violin,and he started playing, by ear,,certain snippets of violin concertos,which he then asked me to complete -- Mendelssohn,,Tchaikovsky, Sibelius.,And we started talking about music, from Bach,to Beethoven and Brahms,,Bruckner, all the B's,,from Bartók, all the way up to Esa-Pekka Salonen. 
 And I understood that he not only,had an encyclopedic knowledge of music,,but he related to this music at a personal level.,He spoke about it with the kind of passion,and understanding that I share with my colleagues,in the Los Angeles Philharmonic.,And through playing music and talking about music,,this man had transformed,from the paranoid, disturbed man,that had just come from walking the streets,of downtown Los Angeles,to the charming, erudite,,brilliant, Juilliard-trained musician. 
 Music is medicine. Music changes us.,And for Nathaniel, music is sanity.,Because music allows him to take his thoughts,and delusions and shape them,through his imagination and his creativity,,into reality.,And that is an escape,from his tormented state.,And I understood that this was the very essence of art.,This was the very reason why we made music,,that we take something that exists within all of us,at our very fundamental core,,our emotions,,and through our artistic lens,,through our creativity, we're able to shape those emotions into reality.,And the reality of that expression,reaches all of us,and moves us, inspires and unites us. 
 And for Nathaniel,,music brought him back into a fold of friends.,The redemptive power of music brought him back,into a family of musicians,that understood him,,that recognized his talents,and respected him.,And I will always make music with Nathaniel,,whether we're at Walt Disney Concert Hall,or on Skid Row, because he reminds me,why I became a musician.,Thank you.,(Applause) 
 Bruno Giussani: Thank you. Thanks.,Robert Gupta.,(Applause) 
 Robert Gupta: I'm going to play something that I shamelessly stole from cellists.,So, please forgive me. 
 (Laughter),(Music),(Applause)Today, I want you to look at,children who become suicide bombers,through a completely different lens.,In 2009, there were 500,bomb blasts across Pakistan.,I spent the year working,with children,who were training to become suicide bombers,and with Taliban recruiters,,trying to understand how the Taliban,were converting these children,into live ammunition,and why these children were actively,signing up to their cause. 
 I want you to watch a short video,from my latest documentary film, "Children of the Taliban." 
 (Singing) 
 The Taliban now run their own schools.,They target poor families,and convince the parents to send their children.,In return, they provide free food and shelter,and sometimes pay the families a monthly stipend.,We've obtained a propaganda video,made by the Taliban.,Young boys are taught justifications,for suicide attacks,and the execution of spies. 
 I made contact with a child from Swat,who studied in a madrassa like this.,Hazrat Ali is from a,poor farming family in Swat.,He joined the Taliban a year ago,when he was 13. 
 How do the Taliban in your area get people to join them? 
 Hazrat Ali: They first call us to the mosque and preach to us.,Then they take us to a madrassa,and teach us things from the Koran. 
 Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy: He tells me that children,are then given months of military training. 
 HA: They teach us to use machine guns, Kalashnikov,,rocket launchers, grenades, bombs.,They ask us to use them only against the infidels.,Then they teach us to do a suicide attack. 
 SOC: Would you like to carry out a suicide attack? 
 HA: If God gives me strength. 
 SOC: I, in my research,,have seen that the Taliban have perfected,the way in which they recruit,and train children,,and I think it's a five-step process.,Step one is that the Taliban prey,on families that are large, that are poor,,that live in rural areas.,They separate the parents from the children,by promising to provide food, clothing,,shelter to these children.,Then they ship them off, hundreds of miles away,to hard-line schools,that run along the Taliban agenda. 
 Step two:,They teach the children the Koran, which is Islam's holiest book,,in Arabic, a language these children do not understand,and cannot speak.,They rely very heavily on teachers,,who I have personally seen,distort the message to these children,as and when it suits their purpose to.,These children are explicitly forbidden,from reading newspapers, listening to radio,,reading any books,that the teachers do not prescribe them.,If any child is found violating these rules,,he is severely reprimanded.,Effectively, the Taliban create,a complete blackout,of any other source of information for these children. 
 Step three: The Taliban want these children,to hate the world that they currently live in.,So they beat these children --,I have seen it;,they feed them twice a day dried bread and water;,they rarely allow them to play games;,they tell them that, for eight hours at a time,,all they have to do is read the Koran.,The children are virtual prisoners;,they cannot leave, they cannot go home.,Their parents are so poor,,they have no resources to get them back. 
 Step four: The older members of the Taliban,,the fighters,,start talking to the younger boys,about the glories of martyrdom.,They talk to them about how when they die,,they will be received up,with lakes of honey and milk,,how there will be 72 virgins,waiting for them in paradise,,how there will be unlimited food,,and how this glory,is going to propel them to become,heroes in their neighborhoods.,Effectively, this is the brainwashing process,that has begun. 
 Step five: I believe the Taliban have,one of the most effective,means of propaganda.,Their videos that they use,are intercut with photographs,of men and women and children,dying in Iraq and Afghanistan,and in Pakistan.,And the basic message is that the Western powers,do not care about civilian deaths,,so those people who live,in areas and support governments,that work with Western powers are fair game.,That's why Pakistani civilians,,over 6,000 of whom have been killed in the last two years alone,,are fair game.,Now these children are primed,to become suicide bombers.,They're ready to go out and fight,because they've been told that this is,effectively their only way,to glorify Islam. 
 I want you to watch another excerpt from the film. 
 This boy is called Zenola.,He blew himself up, killing six.,This boy is called Sadik.,He killed 22.,This boy is called Messoud.,He killed 28.,The Taliban are running suicide schools,,preparing a generation of boys,for atrocities against civilians. 
 Do you want to carry out a suicide attack? 
 Boy: I would love to.,But only if I get permission from my dad.,When I look at suicide bombers younger than me, or my age,,I get so inspired by their terrific attacks. 
 SOC: What blessing would you get,from carrying out a suicide attack? 
 Boy: On the day of judgment, God will ask me,,"Why did you do that?",I will answer, "My Lord! Only to make you happy!,I have laid down my life fighting the infidels.",Then God will look at my intention.,If my intention was to eradicate evil for Islam,,then I will be rewarded with paradise. 
 Singer: ♫ On the day of judgment ♫,♫ My God will call me ♫,♫ My body will be put back together ♫,♫ And God will ask me why I did this ♫ 
 SOC: I leave you all with this thought:,If you grew up in these circumstances,,faced with these choices,,would you choose to live in this world,or in the glorious afterlife?,As one Taliban recruiter told me,,"There will always be sacrificial lambs in this war." 
 Thank you.,(Applause)I think I'll start outnand just talk a little bit,about what exactly autism is.,Autism is a very big continuum,that goes from very severe --nthe child remains nonverbal --,all the way up to brilliantnscientists and engineers.,And I actually feel at home here,,because there's a lotnof autism genetics here. 
 (Laughter) 
 You wouldn't have any -- 
 (Applause) 
 It's a continuum of traits.,When does a nerd turn into Asperger,nwhich is just mild autism?,I mean, Einstein and Mozart and Teslanwould all be probably diagnosed,as autistic spectrum today.,And one of the thingsnthat is really going to concern me,is getting these kids to be the ones,that are going to inventnthe next energy things,that Bill Gates talked about this morning. 
 OK, now, if you wantnto understand autism: animals.,I want to talk to you nownabout different ways of thinking.,You have to get away from verbal language.,I think in pictures.nI don't think in language.,Now, the thing about the autistic mindnis it attends to details.,This is a test where you eithernhave to pick out the big letters,or the little letters,,and the autistic mind picks outnthe little letters more quickly. 
 And the thing is, the normal brainnignores the details.,Well, if you're building a bridge,ndetails are pretty important,because it'll fall downnif you ignore the details.,And one of my big concernsnwith a lot of policy things today,is things are getting too abstract.,People are getting awaynfrom doing hands-on stuff.,I'm really concernednthat a lot of the schools,have taken out the hands-on classes,nbecause art, and classes like that --,those are the classes where I excelled. 
 In my work with cattle,,I noticed a lot of little thingsnthat most people don't notice,would make the cattle balk.,For example, this flag wavingnright in front of the veterinary facility.,This feed yard was going to tear downntheir whole veterinary facility;,all they needed to do was move the flag.,Rapid movement, contrast.,In the early '70s when I started,nI got right down in the chutes,to see what cattle were seeing.,People thought that was crazy.,A coat on a fence would make them balk,nshadows would make them balk,,a hose on the floor --npeople weren't noticing these things.,A chain hanging down ...,And that's shownnvery, very nicely in the movie. 
 In fact, I loved the movie,nhow they duplicated all my projects.,That's the geek side.,My drawings got to star in the movie, too.,And, actually, it's calledn"Temple Grandin,",not "Thinking in Pictures." 
 So what is thinking in pictures?,It's literally movies in your head.,My mind works like Google for images.,When I was a young kid,nI didn't know my thinking was different.,I thought everybody thought in pictures.,Then when I did my book,n"Thinking in Pictures,",I started interviewing peoplenabout how they think.,And I was shocked to find outnthat my thinking was quite different.,Like if I say, "Thinknabout a church steeple,",most people get this sortnof generalized generic one.,Now, maybe that's not true in this room,,but it's going to be truenin a lot of different places.,I see only specific pictures.,They flash up into my memory,njust like Google for pictures.,And in the movie,nthey've got a great scene in there,,where the word "shoe" is said,nand a whole bunch of '50s and '60s shoes,pop into my imagination. 
 OK, there's my childhood church;nthat's specific.,There's some more, Fort Collins.,OK, how about famous ones?,And they just kind of come up,nkind of like this.,Just really quickly,nlike Google for pictures.,And they come up one at a time,,and then I think, "OK, well,nmaybe we can have it snow,,or we can have a thunderstorm,",and I can hold it therenand turn them into videos. 
 Now, visual thinkingnwas a tremendous asset,in my work designingncattle-handling facilities.,And I've worked really hardnon improving how cattle are treated,at the slaughter plant.,I'm not going to goninto any gucky slaughter slides.,I've got that stuff up on YouTube,nif you want to look at it. 
 (Laughter) 
 But one of the thingsnthat I was able to do in my design work,is I could test-run a piecenof equipment in my mind,,just like a virtual realityncomputer system.,And this is an aerial viewnof a recreation of one of my projects,that was used in the movie.,That was like just so super cool.,And there were a lot of, kind of,nAsperger types and autism types,working out there on the movie set, too. 
 (Laughter) 
 But one of the thingsnthat really worries me is:,Where's the younger versionnof those kids going today?,They're not ending up in Silicon Valley,,where they belong. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 One of the things I learned very early onnbecause I wasn't that social,,is I had to sell my work, and not myself.,And the way I sold livestock jobsnis I showed off my drawings,,I showed off pictures of things.,Another thing that helped menas a little kid,is, boy, in the '50s,nyou were taught manners.,You were taught you can't pullnthe merchandise off the shelves,in the store and throw it around. 
 When kids get to benin third or fourth grade,,you might see that this kid's goingnto be a visual thinker,,drawing in perspective.,Now, I want to emphasize,that not every autistic kidnis going to be a visual thinker.,Now, I had this brain scanndone several years ago,,and I used to joke around about havingna gigantic Internet trunk line,going deep into my visual cortex.,This is tensor imaging.,And my great big Internet trunk linenis twice as big as the control's.,The red lines there are me,,and the blue lines are the sexnand age-matched control.,And there I got a gigantic one,,and the control over there, the blue one,nhas got a really small one. 
 And some of the research now is showing,that people on the spectrum actuallynthink with the primary visual cortex.,Now, the thing is, the visual thinkernis just one kind of mind.,You see, the autistic mindntends to be a specialist mind --,good at one thing, bad at something else.,And where I was bad was algebra.,And I was never allowednto take geometry or trig.,Gigantic mistake.,I'm finding a lot of kidsnwho need to skip algebra,,go right to geometry and trig. 
 Now, another kind of mindnis the pattern thinker.,More abstract.,These are your engineers,nyour computer programmers.,This is pattern thinking.,That praying mantis is madenfrom a single sheet of paper --,no scotch tape, no cuts.,And there in the backgroundnis the pattern for folding it.,Here are the types of thinking:,photo-realistic visual thinkers, like me;,pattern thinkers, music and math minds.,Some of these oftentimesnhave problems with reading.,You also will see these kind of problemsnwith kids that are dyslexic.,You'll see these different kinds of minds.,And then there's a verbal mind,nthey know every fact about everything. 
 Now, another thing is the sensory issues.,I was really concerned about havingnto wear this gadget on my face.,And I came in half an hour beforehand,so I could have it put onnand kind of get used to it,,and they got it bentnso it's not hitting my chin.,But sensory is an issue.,Some kids are botherednby fluorescent lights;,others have problemsnwith sound sensitivity.,You know, it's going to be variable. 
 Now, visual thinking gave mena whole lot of insight,into the animal mind.,Because think about it:nan animal is a sensory-based thinker,,not verbal -- thinks in pictures,nthinks in sounds, thinks in smells.,Think about how much informationnthere is on the local fire hydrant.,He knows who's been there -- 
 (Laughter) 
 When they were there.,Are they friend or foe?nIs there anybody he can go mate with?,There's a ton of informationnon that fire hydrant.,It's all very detailed information.,And looking at these kind of detailsngave me a lot of insight into animals. 
 Now, the animal mind, and also my mind,,puts sensory-based informationninto categories.,Man on a horse,,and a man on the ground --,that is viewed as twontotally different things.,You could have a horsenthat's been abused by a rider.,They'll be absolutely finenwith the veterinarian,and with the horseshoer,nbut you can't ride him.,You have another horse,nwhere maybe the horseshoer beat him up,,and he'll be terrible for anythingnon the ground with the veterinarian,,but a person can ride him.,Cattle are the same way.,Man on a horse, a man on foot --nthey're two different things.,You see, it's a different picture.,See, I want you to thinknabout just how specific this is. 
 Now, this ability to putninformation into categories,,I find a lot of peoplenare not very good at this.,When I'm out troubleshooting equipment,or problems with something in a plant,,they don't seem to be able to figure out:,"Do I have a training-people issue?,Or do I have something wrongnwith the equipment?",In other words, categorizenequipment problem from a people problem.,I find a lot of peoplenhave difficulty doing that.,Now, let's say I figure outnit's an equipment problem.,Is it a minor problem,nwith something simple I can fix?,Or is the whole designnof the system wrong?,People have a hard time figuring that out. 
 Let's just look at somethingnlike, you know,,solving problems with makingnairlines safer.,Yeah, I'm a million-mile flier.,I do lots and lots of flying,,and if I was at the FAA,,what would I be doing a lotnof direct observation of?,It would be their airplane tails.,You know, five fatal wrecksnin the last 20 years,,the tail either came off,,or steering stuff inside the tailnbroke in some way.,It's tails, pure and simple.,And when the pilots walknaround the plane, guess what?,They can't see that stuff inside the tail.,Now as I think about that,,I'm pulling up all of thatnspecific information.,It's specific.,See, my thinking's bottom-up.,I take all the little pieces and I putnthe pieces together like a puzzle. 
 Now, here is a horse that was deathlynafraid of black cowboy hats.,He'd been abused by somebodynwith a black cowboy hat.,White cowboy hats,nthat was absolutely fine.,Now, the thing is,nthe world is going to need,all of the different kinds of mindsnto work together.,We've got to work on developingnall these different kinds of minds.,And one of the thingsnthat is driving me really crazy,as I travel aroundnand I do autism meetings,,is I'm seeing a lot of smart,ngeeky, nerdy kids,,and they just aren't very social,,and nobody's workingnon developing their interest,in something like science. 
 And this brings up the whole thingnof my science teacher.,My science teacher is shownnabsolutely beautifully in the movie.,I was a goofball studentnwhen I was in high school.,I just didn't care at all about studying,,until I had Mr. Carlock's science class.,He was now Dr. Carlock in the movie.,And he got me challengednto figure out an optical illusion room.,This brings up the whole thingnof you've got to show kids,interesting stuff.,You know, one of the thingsnthat I think maybe TED ought to do,is tell all the schools about allnthe great lectures that are on TED,,and there's all kindsnof great stuff on the Internet,to get these kids turned on.,Because I'm seeing a lotnof these geeky, nerdy kids,,and the teachers out in the Midwestnand other parts of the country,when you get away from these tech areas,,they don't know what to donwith these kids.,And they're not going down the right path. 
 The thing is, you can make a mind,to be more of a thinkingnand cognitive mind,,or your mind can be wirednto be more social.,And what some of the researchnnow has shown in autism,is there may by extra wiring back herenin the really brilliant mind,,and we lose a few social circuits here.,It's kind of a trade-offnbetween thinking and social.,And then you can get to the pointnwhere it's so severe,,you're going to have a personnthat's going to be non-verbal.,In the normal human mind,,language covers up the visual thinkingnwe share with animals. 
 This is the work of Dr. Bruce Miller.,He studied Alzheimer's patientsnthat had frontal temporal lobe dementia.,And the dementia ate outnthe language parts of the brain.,And then this artwork came out of somebody,who used to install stereos in cars.,Now, Van Gogh doesn't knownanything about physics,,but I think it's very interestingnthat there was some work done,to show that this eddy patternnin this painting,followed a statistical modelnof turbulence,,which brings up the whole interesting idea,of maybe some of this mathematicalnpatterns is in our own head. 
 And the Wolfram stuff --,I was taking notes and writing downnall the search words I could use,,because I think that's going to go onnin my autism lectures.,We've got to shownthese kids interesting stuff.,And they've taken out the auto-shop class,and the drafting class and the art class.,I mean, art was my best subject in school. 
 We've got to think about allnthese different kinds of minds,,and we've got to absolutelynwork with these kind of minds,,because we absolutely are going to need,these kinds of people in the future.,And let's talk about jobs.,OK, my science teacher got me studying,,because I was a goofballnthat didn't want to study.,But you know what?nI was getting work experience.,I'm seeing too many of these smart kidsnwho haven't learned basic things,,like how to be on time -- I was taughtnthat when I was eight years old.,How to have table mannersnat granny's Sunday party.,I was taught thatnwhen I was very, very young.,And when I was 13, I had a jobnat a dressmaker's shop sewing clothes.,I did internships in college,,I was building things,,and I also had to learnnhow to do assignments. 
 You know, all I wanted to do was drawnpictures of horses when I was little.,My mother said, "Well let's dona picture of something else.",They've got to learnnhow to do something else.,Let's say the kid is fixated on Legos.,Let's get him workingnon building different things.,The thing about the autistic mindnis it tends to be fixated.,Like if the kid loves race cars,nlet's use race cars for math.,Let's figure out how long it takesna race car to go a certain distance.,In other words, use that fixation,in order to motivate that kid,nthat's one of the things we need to do.,I really get fed up when the teachers,,especially when you get awaynfrom this part of the country,,they don't know what to donwith these smart kids.,It just drives me crazy. 
 What can visual thinkersndo when they grow up?,They can do graphic design,nall kinds of stuff with computers,,photography, industrial design.,The pattern thinkers -- they're the onesnthat are going to be your mathematicians,,your software engineers,nyour computer programmers,,all of those kinds of jobs.,And then you've got the word minds;nthey make great journalists,,and they also make really,nreally good stage actors.,Because the thing about being autistic is,,I had to learn social skillsnlike being in a play.,You just kind of ...nyou just have to learn it. 
 And we need to be workingnwith these students.,And this brings up mentors.,You know, my science teachernwas not an accredited teacher.,He was a NASA space scientist.,Some states now are getting it to where,nif you have a degree in biology,or in chemistry,,you can come into the schoolnand teach biology or chemistry.,We need to be doing that.,Because what I'm observing is,,the good teachers,nfor a lot of these kids,,are out in the community colleges.,But we need to be gettingnsome of these good teachers,into the high schools. 
 Another thing that can be very,nvery, very successful is:,there's a lot of peoplenthat may have retired,from working in the software industry,,and they can teach your kid.,And it doesn't matternif what they teach them is old,,because what you're doingnis you're lighting the spark.,You're getting that kid turned on.,And you get him turned on,nthen you'll learn all the new stuff.,Mentors are just essential.,I cannot emphasize enoughnwhat my science teacher did for me.,And we've got to mentor them, hire them. 
 And if you bring them innfor internships in your companies,,the thing about the autism,nAsperger-y kind of mind,,you've got to give them a specific task.,Don't just say, "Design new software.",You've got to tell themnsomething more specific:,"We're designing software for a phone,and it has to do some specific thing,,and it can only use so much memory.",That's the kind of specificity you need. 
 Well, that's the end of my talk.,And I just want to thankneverybody for coming.,It was great to be here. 
 (Applause),(Applause ends) 
 Oh -- you have a question for me? OK. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson:nThank you so much for that.,You know, you once wrote --nI like this quote:,"If by some magic, autism had beenneradicated from the face of the Earth,,then men would still be socializingnin front of a wood fire,at the entrance to a cave." 
 (Laughter) 
 Temple Grandin: Because who do you thinknmade the first stone spear?,It was the Asperger guy,,and if you were to get ridnof all the autism genetics,,there'd be no more Silicon Valley,nand the energy crisis would not be solved. 
 (Applause) 
 CA: I want to ask youna couple other questions,,and if any of these feel inappropriate,nit's OK just to say, "Next question.",But if there is someone herenwho has an autistic child,,or knows an autistic child and feelsnkind of cut off from them,,what advice would you give them? 
 TG: Well, first of all,nwe've got to look at age.,If you have a two, three or four-year-old,nno speech, no social interaction,,I can't emphasize enough: Don't wait.,You need at least 20 hours a weeknof one-to-one teaching.,The thing is, autism comesnin different degrees.,About half of the people on the spectrumnare not going to learn to talk,,and they won't be workingnin Silicon Valley.,That would not be a reasonablenthing for them to do. 
 But then you get these smart,ngeeky kids with a touch of autism,,and that's where you've gotnto get them turned on,with doing interesting things.,I got social interactionnthrough shared interests --,I rode horses with other kids,nI made model rockets with other kids,,did electronics lab with other kids.,And in the '60s, it was gluing mirrorsnonto a rubber membrane on a speaker,to make a light show.,That was, like,nwe considered that super cool. 
 (Laughter) 
 CA: Is it unrealistic for them,to hope or think that that childnloves them, as some might, as most, wish? 
 TG: Well, I tell you,nthat child will be loyal,,and if your house is burning down,nthey're going to get you out of it. 
 CA: Wow. So most people, if you ask themnwhat they're most passionate about,,they'd say things like,n"My kids" or "My lover.",What are you most passionate about? 
 TG: I'm passionatenabout that the things I do,are going to makenthe world a better place.,When I have a mothernof an autistic child say,,"My kid went to collegenbecause of your book,or one of your lectures,",that makes me happy. 
 You know, the slaughter plantsnI worked with in the '80s;,they were absolutely awful.,I developed a really simplenscoring system for slaughter plants,,where you just measure outcomes:,How many cattle fell down?,How many got poked with the prodder?,How many cattlenare mooing their heads off?,And it's very, very simple.,You directly observe a few simple things.,It's worked really well.,I get satisfaction out of seeing stuff,that makes real change in the real world.,We need a lot more of that,nand a lot less abstract stuff. 
 CA: Totally. 
 (Applause) 
 CA: When we were talking on the phone,none of the things you said,that really astonished me,was that one thing you were passionatenabout was server farms.,Tell me about that. 
 TG: Well, the reason why I got reallynexcited when I read about that,,it contains knowledge.,It's libraries.,And to me, knowledge is somethingnthat is extremely valuable.,So, maybe over 10 years agonnow, our library got flooded.,This is before the Internetngot really big.,And I was really upsetnabout all the books being wrecked,,because it was knowledge being destroyed.,And server farms, or data centers,nare great libraries of knowledge. 
 CA: Temple, can I just say,,it's an absolute delightnto have you at TED.,Thank you so much. 
 TG: Well, thank you so much. Thank you. 
 (Applause)Last year here at TED,I asked you to give me your data,,to put your data on the web, on the basis,that if people put data onto the web --,government data, scientific data, community data,,whatever it is -- it will be used by other people,to do wonderful things, in ways,that they never could have imagined. 
 So, today I'm back just to show you a few things,,to show you, in fact, there is,an open data movement afoot,,now, around the world.,The cry of "Raw data now!",which I made people make in the auditorium,,was heard around the world.,So, let's roll the video. 
 A classic story, the first one which lots of people picked up,,was when in March -- on March 10th in fact, soon after TED --,Paul Clarke, in the U.K. government,,blogged, "Oh, I've just got some raw data. Here it is,,it's about bicycle accidents.",Two days it took the Times Online,to make a map, a mashable map --,we call these things mash-ups --,a mashed-up user interface that allows you to go in there,and have a look and find out whether your bicycle,route to work was affected. 
 Here's more data, traffic survey data,,again, put out by the U.K. government,,and because they put it up using the Linked Data standards,,then a user could just make a map,,just by clicking. 
 Does this data affect things? Well, let's get back to 2008.,Look at Zanesville, Ohio.,Here's a map a lawyer made. He put on it the water plant,,and which houses are there,,which houses have been connected to the water.,And he got, from other data sources,,information to show,which houses are occupied by white people.,Well, there was too much of a correlation, he felt,,between which houses were occupied by white people,and which houses had water, and the judge was not impressed either.,The judge was not impressed to the tune of 10.9 million dollars.,That's the power of taking one piece of data,,another piece of data, putting it together,,and showing the result. 
 Let's look at some data from the U.K. now.,This is U.K. government data, a completely independent site,,Where Does My Money Go.,It allows anybody to go there and burrow down.,You can burrow down by a particular type of spending,,or you can go through all the different regions and compare them.,So, that's happening in the U.K. with U.K. government data. 
 Yes, certainly you can do it over here.,Here's a site which allows you to look at recovery spending,in California.,Take an arbitrary example, Long Beach, California,,you can go and have a look at what recovery money they've been spending,on different things such as energy. 
 In fact, this is the graph of the number of data sets,in the repositories of data.gov,,and data.gov.uk.,And I'm delighted to see a great competition,between the U.K. in blue, and the U.S. in red. 
 How can you use this stuff?,Well, for example, if you have lots of data about places,you can take, from a postcode --,which is like a zip plus four --,for a specific group of houses, you can make paper,,print off a paper which has got very, very,specific things about the bus stops,,the things specifically near you. 
 On a larger scale, this is a mash-up,of the data which was released about the Afghan elections.,It allows you to set your own criteria,for what sort of things you want to look at.,The red circles are polling stations,,selected by your criteria.,And then you can select also other things on the map,to see what other factors, like the threat level.,So, that was government data. 
 I also talked about community-generated data -- in fact I edited some.,This is the wiki map, this is the Open Street Map.,"Terrace Theater" I actually put,on the map because it wasn't on the map before TED last year.,I was not the only person editing the open street map.,Each flash on this visualization --,put together by ITO World --,shows an edit in 2009,made to the Open Street Map.,Let's now spin the world during the same year.,Every flash is an edit. Somebody somewhere,looking at the Open Street Map, and realizing it could be better.,You can see Europe is ablaze with updates.,Some places, perhaps not as much as they should be. 
 Here focusing in on Haiti.,The map of Port au-Prince at the end,of 2009 was not all it could be,,not as good as the map of California.,Fortunately, just after the earthquake,,GeoEye, a commercial company,,released satellite imagery,with a license, which allowed,the open-source community to use it.,This is January, in time lapse,,of people editing ... that's the earthquake.,After the earthquake, immediately,,people all over the world, mappers,who wanted to help, and could,,looked at that imagery, built the map, quickly building it up. 
 We're focusing now on Port-au-Prince.,The light blue is refugee camps these volunteers had spotted from the [satellite images].,So, now we have, immediately, a real-time map,showing where there are refugee camps --,rapidly became the best map,to use if you're doing relief work in Port-au-Prince.,Witness the fact that it's here on this Garmin device,being used by rescue team in Haiti. 
 There's the map showing,,on the left-hand side,,that hospital -- actually that's a hospital ship.,This is a real-time map that shows blocked roads,,damaged buildings, refugee camps --,it shows things that are needed [for rescue and relief work]. 
 So, if you've been involved in that at all,,I just wanted to say: Whatever you've been doing,,whether you've just been chanting, "Raw data now!",or you've been putting government or scientific data online,,I just wanted to take this opportunity to say: Thank you very much,,and we have only just started!,(Applause)Good afternoon.,There's a medical revolutionnhappening all around us,,and it's one that's goingnto help us conquer,some of society's most dreaded conditions,,including cancer.,The revolution is called angiogenesis,,and it's based on the processnthat our bodies use to grow blood vessels. 
 So why should we care about blood vessels?,Well, the human bodynis literally packed with them --,60,000 miles worth in a typical adult.,End to end, that would form a linenthat would circle the earth twice.,The smallest blood vesselsnare called capillaries.,We've got 19 billion of themnin our bodies.,And these are the vessels of life,,and as I'll show you,nthey can also be the vessels of death.,Now, the remarkable thingnabout blood vessels,is that they have this ability,to adapt to whatever environmentnthey're growing in.,For example, in the liver,nthey form channels to detoxify the blood;,in the lungs, they line air sacsnfor gas exchange.,In muscle, they corkscrew,,so that muscles can contractnwithout cutting off circulation.,And in nerves, they course alongnlike power lines,,keeping those nerves alive. 
 We get most of these blood vessels,when we're actually still in the womb.,And what that means is that as adults,,blood vessels don't normally grow.,Except in a few special circumstances.,In women, blood vessels grow every month,,to build the lining of the uterus.,During pregnancy, they form the placenta,,which connects mom and baby.,And after injury, blood vesselsnactually have to grow under the scab,in order to heal a wound.,And this is actually what it looks like,,hundreds of blood vessels, all growingntoward the center of the wound. 
 So the body has the ability to regulate,the amount of blood vesselsnthat are present at any given time.,It does this through an elaboratenand elegant system of checks and balances,,stimulators and inhibitorsnof angiogenesis,,such that, when we needna brief burst of blood vessels,,the body can do thisnby releasing stimulators,,proteins called angiogenic factors,,that act as natural fertilizer,nand stimulate new blood vessels to sprout.,When those excess vesselsnare no longer needed,,the body prunes them back to baseline,,using naturally-occurringninhibitors of angiogenesis.,There are other situationsnwhere we start beneath the baseline,,and we need to grow more blood vessels,njust to get back to normal levels --,for example, after an injury --,and the body can do that too,nbut only to that normal level,,that set point. 
 But what we now know,nis that for a number of diseases,,there are defects in the system,,where the body can't prune backnextra blood vessels,,or can't grow enough new onesnin the right place at the right time.,And in these situations,nangiogenesis is out of balance.,And when angiogenesis is out of balance,,a myriad of diseases result.,For example, insufficient angiogenesis --nnot enough blood vessels --,leads to woundsnthat don't heal, heart attacks,,legs without circulation,ndeath from stroke,,nerve damage.,And on the other end,nexcessive angiogenesis --,too many blood vessels -- drives disease,,and we see this in cancer, blindness,,arthritis, obesity, Alzheimer's disease.,In total, there are morenthan 70 major diseases,affecting more than a billionnpeople worldwide,,that all look on the surface to bendifferent from one another,,but all actually sharenabnormal angiogenesis,as their common denominator.,And this realization is allowingnus to re-conceptualize,the way that we actuallynapproach these diseases,,by controlling angiogenesis. 
 Now, I'm going to focus on cancer,,because angiogenesisnis a hallmark of cancer --,every type of cancer.,So here we go.,This is a tumor: dark, gray, ominousnmass growing inside a brain.,And under the microscope,,you can see hundredsnof these brown-stained blood vessels,,capillaries that are feeding cancer cells,,bringing oxygen and nutrients.,But cancers don't start out like this,,and in fact, cancers don't start outnwith a blood supply.,They start out as small,nmicroscopic nests of cells,,that can only grow to one halfna cubic millimeter in size.,That's the tip of a ballpoint pen.,Then they can't get any largernbecause they don't have a blood supply,,so they don't havenenough oxygen or nutrients. 
 In fact, we're probably formingnthese microscopic cancers,all the time in our body.,Autopsy studies from peoplenwho died in car accidents,have shown that about 40 percent of womennbetween the ages of 40 and 50,actually have microscopicncancers in their breasts.,About 50 percent of mennin their 50s and 60s,have microscopic prostate cancers,,and virtually 100 percent of us,nby the time we reach our 70s,,will have microscopic cancersngrowing in our thyroid.,Yet, without a blood supply,,most of these cancersnwill never become dangerous.,Dr. Judah Folkman, who was my mentor,and who was the pioneernof the angiogenesis field,,once called this "cancer without disease." 
 So the body's abilitynto balance angiogenesis,,when it's working properly,,prevents blood vesselsnfrom feeding cancers.,And this turns out to be,one of our most importantndefense mechanisms,against cancer.,In fact, if you actuallynblock angiogenesis,and prevent blood vesselsnfrom ever reaching cancer cells,,tumors simply can't grow up.,But once angiogenesis occurs,,cancers can grow exponentially.,And this is actually how a cancerngoes from being harmless,,to being deadly.,Cancer cells mutate,,and they gain the ability to releasenlots of those angiogenic factors,,natural fertilizer,,that tip the balance in favornof blood vessels invading the cancer.,And once those vessels invade the cancer,,it can expand,nit can invade local tissues,,and the same vesselsnthat are feeding tumors,allow cancer cells to exitninto the circulation as metastases.,And unfortunately,nthis late stage of cancer,is the one at whichnit's most likely to be diagnosed,,when angiogenesis is already turned on,,and cancer cells are growing like wild. 
 So, if angiogenesis is a tipping point,between a harmless cancernand a harmful one,,then one major partnof the angiogenesis revolution,is a new approach to treating cancer,by cutting off the blood supply.,We call this antiangiogenic therapy,,and it's completely differentnfrom chemotherapy,,because it selectively aims,at the blood vesselsnthat are feeding the cancers.,We can do this because tumor blood vesselsnare unlike normal, healthy vessels,we see in other places of the body --,they're abnormal,nthey're very poorly constructed,,and because of that,nthey're highly vulnerable,to treatments that target them.,In effect, when we give cancer patientsnantiangiogenic therapy --,here, an experimental drug for a glioma,,which is a type of brain tumor --,you can see that there arendramatic changes that occur,when the tumor is being starved.,Here's a woman with a breast cancer,,being treated with the antiangiogenicndrug called Avastin,,which is FDA approved.,And you can seenthat the halo of blood flow,disappears after treatment. 
 Well, I've just shown yountwo very different types of cancer,that both respondednto antiangiogenic therapy.,So a few years ago, I asked myself,,"Can we take this one step furthernand treat other cancers,,even in other species?",So here is a nine year-oldnboxer named Milo,,who had a very aggressive tumor,called a malignant neurofibromangrowing on his shoulder.,It invaded into his lungs.,His veterinarian only gave himnthree months to live.,So we created a cocktailnof antiangiogenic drugs,that could be mixed into his dog food,,as well as an antiangiogenic cream,,that could be appliednon the surface of the tumor.,And within a few weeks of treatment,,we were able to slow downnthat cancer's growth,,such that we were ultimatelynable to extend Milo’s survival,to six times what the veterinariannhad initially predicted,,all with a very good quality of life.,And we've subsequently treatednmore than 600 dogs.,We have about a 60 percent response rate,,and improved survival for these pets,that were about to be euthanized. 
 So let me show you a couplenof even more interesting examples.,This is 20-year-old dolphinnliving in Florida,,and she had these lesions in her mouth,that, over the course of three years,,developed into invasivensquamous cell cancers.,So we created an antiangiogenic paste.,We had it painted on top of the cancernthree times a week.,And over the course of seven months,,the cancers completely disappeared,,and the biopsies came back as normal. 
 Here's a cancer growing on the lip,of a Quarter Horse named Guinness.,It's a very, very deadly typenof cancer called an angiosarcoma.,It had already spread to his lymph nodes,,so we used an antiangiogenicnskin cream for the lip,,and the oral cocktail, so we could treatnfrom the inside as well as the outside.,And over the course of six months,,he experienced a complete remission.,And here he is six years later,,Guinness, with his very happy owner. 
 (Applause) 
 Now obviously, antiangiogenic therapyncould be used for a wide range of cancers.,And in fact, the firstnpioneering treatments,for people as well as dogs,,are already becoming available.,There are 12 different drugs,n11 different cancer types.,But the real question is:,How well do these work in practice?,So here's actuallynthe patient survival data,from eight different types of cancer.,The bars represent survival time,taken from the era in whichnthere was only chemotherapy,,or surgery, or radiation available.,But starting in 2004,,when antiangiogenic therapiesnfirst became available,,you can see that there has been a 70nto 100 percent improvement in survival,for people with kidney cancer,nmultiple myeloma,,colorectal cancer,nand gastrointestinal stromal tumors.,That's impressive.,But for other tumors and cancer types,,the improvements have only been modest. 
 So I started asking myself,,"Why haven't we been able to do better?",And the answer, to me, is obvious:,we're treating cancerntoo late in the game,,when it's already established,,and oftentimes, it's alreadynspread or metastasized.,And as a doctor,,I know that once a disease progressesnto an advanced stage,,achieving a cure can be difficult,nif not impossible.,So I went back to the biologynof angiogenesis, and started thinking:,Could the answer to cancernbe preventing angiogenesis,,beating cancer at its own game,,so the cancers could nevernbecome dangerous?,This could help healthy people,,as well as people who've alreadynbeaten cancer once or twice,,and want to find a waynto keep it from coming back. 
 So to look for a way to preventnangiogenesis in cancer,,I went back to look at cancer's causes.,And what really intrigued me,,was when I saw that dietnaccounts for 30 to 35 percent,of environmentally-caused cancers.,Now the obvious thing is to think aboutnwhat we could remove from our diet,,what to strip out, take away.,But I actually tookna completely opposite approach,,and began asking: What couldnwe be adding to our diet,that's naturally antiangiogenic,,and that could boostnthe body's defense system,,and beat back those blood vesselsnthat are feeding cancers?,In other words, can we eatnto starve cancer? 
 (Laughter) 
 Well, the answer is yes,nand I'm going to show you how.,And our search for thisnhas taken us to the market,,the farm and to the spice cabinet,,because what we've discovered,is that Mother Naturenhas laced a large number,of foods and beverages and herbs,with naturally-occurringninhibitors of angiogenesis. 
 Here's a test system we developed.,At the center is a ring,from which hundreds of blood vesselsnare growing out in a starburst fashion.,And we can use this systemnto test dietary factors,at concentrationsnthat are obtainable by eating.,Let me show you what happens,when we put in an extract from red grapes.,The active ingredient is resveratrol,,it's also found in red wine.,This inhibits abnormal angiogenesis,,by 60 percent.,Here's what happens when we addednan extract from strawberries.,It potently inhibits angiogenesis.,And extract from soybeans.,And here is a growing list,of antiangiogenic foods and beveragesnthat we're interested in studying.,For each food type,,we believe that there arendifferent potencies,within different strains and varietals.,And we want to measure this because,,well, while you're eating a strawberry,or drinking tea,,why not select the one that's most potent,for preventing cancer? 
 So here are four different teasnthat we've tested.,They're all common ones:nChinese jasmine, Japanese sencha,,Earl Grey and a special blendnthat we prepared,,and you can see clearlynthat the teas vary in their potency,,from less potent to more potent.,But what's very cool,is when we combinenthe two less potent teas together,,the combination, the blend,nis more potent than either one alone.,This means there's food synergy. 
 Here's some more data from our testing.,Now in the lab, we cannsimulate tumor angiogenesis,,represented here in a black bar.,And using this system, we can testnthe potency of cancer drugs.,So the shorter the bar,,the less angiogenesis -- that's good.,And here are some common drugs,that have been associated with reducingnthe risk of cancer in people.,Statins, nonsteroidalnanti-inflammatory drugs,,and a few others --nthey inhibit angiogenesis, too.,And here are the dietary factors,going head-to-head against these drugs.,You can see they clearly hold their own,,and in some cases, they're more potentnthan the actual drugs.,Soy, parsley, garlic, grapes, berries.,I could go home and cook a tasty mealnusing these ingredients.,Imagine if we could createnthe world's first rating system,,in which we could score foods,according to their antiangiogenic,ncancer-preventative properties.,And that's what we're doing right now. 
 Now, I've shown you a bunch of lab data,,and so the real question is:,What is the evidence in people,that eating certain foods can reducenangiogenesis in cancer?,Well, the best example I know,is a study of 79,000 mennfollowed over 20 years,,in which it was found that mennwho consumed cooked tomatoes,two to three times a week,,had up to a 50 percent reduction,in their risk of developingnprostate cancer.,Now, we know that tomatoesnare a good source of lycopene,,and lycopene is antiangiogenic.,But what's even moreninteresting from this study,,is that in those men who didndevelop prostate cancer,,those who ate morenservings of tomato sauce,,actually had fewer blood vesselsnfeeding their cancer.,So this human study is a prime example,of how antiangiogenic substances presentnin food and consumed at practical levels,,can have an impact on cancer.,And we're now studyingnthe role of a healthy diet --,with Dean Ornish at UCSFnand Tufts University --,the role of this healthy dietnon markers of angiogenesis,that we can find in the bloodstream. 
 Obviously, what I've shared with younhas some far-ranging implications,,even beyond cancer research.,Because if we're right,nit could impact consumer education,,food services, public health,and even the insurance industry.,And in fact, some insurance companies,are already beginningnto think along these lines.,Check out this ad from BlueCrossnBlueShield of Minnesota.,For many people around the world,,dietary cancer preventionnmay be the only practical solution,,because not everybody can affordnexpensive end-stage cancer treatments,,but everybody could benefitnfrom a healthy diet,based on local, sustainable,nantiangiogenic crops. 
 Now, finally,,I've talked to you about food,,and I've talked to you about cancer,,so there's just one more diseasenthat I have to tell you about,,and that's obesity.,Because it turns outnthat adipose tissue -- fat --,is highly angiogenesis-dependent.,And like a tumor, fat growsnwhen blood vessels grow.,So the question is:,Can we shrink fatnby cutting off its blood supply?,The top curve shows the body weightnof a genetically obese mouse,that eats nonstop until it turns fat,,like this furry tennis ball. 
 (Laughter) 
 And the bottom curvenis the weight of a normal mouse. 
 If you take the obese mouse,and give it an angiogenesisninhibitor, it loses weight.,Stop the treatment, gains the weight back.nRestart the treatment, loses the weight.,Stop the treatment,nit gains the weight back.,And, in fact, you can cyclenthe weight up and down,simply by inhibiting angiogenesis.,So this approach that we're takingnfor cancer prevention,may also have an application for obesity.,The truly interesting thing about this,is that we can't take these obese mice,and make them lose more weight,than what the normal mouse's weightnis supposed to be.,In other words,nwe can't create supermodel mice. 
 (Laughter) 
 And this speaks to the rolenof angiogenesis,in regulating healthy set points. 
 Albert Szent-Györgi once said,,"Discovery consists of seeingnwhat everyone has seen,,and thinking what no one has thought." 
 I hope I've convinced you,that for diseases like cancer,nobesity and other conditions,,there may be a great power,in attacking their commonndenominator: angiogenesis.,And that's what I thinknthe world needs now. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 June Cohen: I havena quick question for you. 
 JC: So these drugs aren't exactlynin mainstream cancer treatments right now.,For anyone out here who has cancer,nwhat would you recommend?,Do you recommend pursuing thesentreatments now, for most cancer patients? 
 William Li: There arenantiangiogenic treatments,that are FDA approved,,and if you're a cancer patient,,or working for one or advocating for one,nyou should ask about them.,And there are many clinical trials.,The Angiogenesis Foundationnis following almost 300 companies,,and there are about 100 morendrugs in that pipeline.,So, consider the approved ones,,look for clinical trials,,but then betweennwhat the doctor can do for you,,we need to start askingnwhat can we do for ourselves.,This is one of the themesnI'm talking about:,We can empower ourselves,to do the things that doctorsncan't do for us,,which is to use knowledge and take action.,And if Mother Naturenhas given us some clues,,we think there might be a new futurenin the value of how we eat,,and what we eat is reallynour chemotherapy three times a day. 
 JC: Right. And along those lines,,for people who might havenrisk factors for cancer,,would you recommend pursuingnany treatments prophylactically,,or simply pursuing the right diet,,with lots of tomato sauce? 
 WL: Well, you know, there's abundantnepidemiological evidence,,and I think in the information age,,it doesn't take long to gonto a credible source like PubMed,,the National Library of Medicine,,to look for epidemiological studiesnfor cancer risk reduction,based on diet and basednon common medications.,And that's certainly somethingnthat anybody can look into. 
 JC: Okay. Well, thank you so much. 
 (Applause)So, basically we have public leaders,,public officials who are out of control;,they are writing bills that are unintelligible,,and out of these bills are going to come,maybe 40,000 pages of regulations, total complexity,,which has a dramatically negative impact on our life.,If you're a veteran coming back from Iraq or Vietnam,you face a blizzard of paperwork to get your benefits;,if you're trying to get a small business loan,,you face a blizzard of paperwork. 
 What are we going to do about it? I define simplicity,as a means to achieving clarity,,transparency and empathy,,building humanity into communications.,I've been simplifying things for 30 years.,I come out of the advertising and design business.,My focus is understanding you people,,and how you interact with the government,to get your benefits,,how you interact with corporations to decide whom you're going to do business with,,and how you view brands. 
 So, very quickly, when President Obama said,,"I don't see why we can't,have a one-page, plain English consumer credit agreement.",So, I locked myself in a room,,figured out the content,,organized the document, and wrote it in plain English.,I've had this checked by the two top,consumer credit lawyers in the country.,This is a real thing.,Now, I went one step further and said,,"Why do we have to stick with the stodgy lawyers,and just have a paper document? Let's go online." 
 And many people,might need help in computation.,Working with the Harvard Business School,,you'll see this example when you talk about minimum payment:,If you spent 62 dollars for a meal,,the longer you take to pay out that loan,,you see, over a period of time using the minimum payment,it's 99 dollars and 17 cents.,How about that? Do you think your bank is going to show that to people?,But it's going to work. It's more effective,than just computational aids.,And what about terms like,"over the limit"?,Perhaps a stealth thing.,Define it in context. Tell people what it means. 
 When you put it in plain English,,you almost force the institution,to give the people a way, a default out of that,,and not put themselves at risk.,Plain English is about,changing the content.,And one of the things I'm most proud of,is this agreement for IBM.,It's a grid, it's a calendar.,At such and such a date, IBM has responsibilities,,you have responsibilities.,Received very favorably by business. 
 And there is some good news to report today.,Each year, one in 10 taxpayers,receives a notice from the IRS.,There are 200 million letters that go out.,Running through this typical letter that they had,,I ran it through my simplicity lab,,it's pretty unintelligible.,All the parts of the document in red are not intelligible.,We looked at doing over 1,000 letters that cover,70 percent of their transactions in plain English.,They have been tested in the laboratory.,When I run it through my lab,,this heat-mapping shows everything,is intelligible.,And the IRS has introduced the program. 
 (Applause) 
 There are a couple of things going on right now,that I want to bring to your attention.,There is a lot of discussion now,about a consumer financial protection agency,,how to mandate simplicity.,We see all this complexity.,It's incumbent upon us,,and this organization, I believe,,to make clarity, transparency,and empathy a national priority.,There is no way that we should allow government,to communicate the way they communicate.,There is no way we should do business,with companies that have agreements,with stealth provisions and that are unintelligible. 
 So, how are we going to change the world?,Make clarity, transparency and simplicity a national priority.,I thank you. 
 (Applause)About a year and a half ago,,Stephen Lawler, who also gave a talk,here at TED in 2007 on Virtual Earth,,brought me over to become the architect of Bing Maps,,which is Microsoft's online-mapping effort.,In the past two and a half, we've been very hard at work,on redefining the way maps work online.,And we really are seeing this in very different terms,from the kind of mapping and direction site,that one is used to. 
 So, the first thing that you might notice about the mapping site,is just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning,,which, if you're familiar at all with Seadragon,,that's where it comes from. 
 Mapping is, of course,,not just about cartography,,it's also about imagery.,So, as we zoom-in beyond a certain level,this resolves into a kind of Sim City-like,virtual view at 45 degrees.,This can be viewed from any of the cardinal directions,to show you the 3D structure of the city, all the facades.,Now, we see this space, this three-dimensional environment,,as being a canvas on which,all sorts of applications can play out,,and map's directions are really just one of them. 
 If you click on this, you'll see,some of the ones that we've put out, just in the past couple of months,since we've launched.,So, for example, a couple of days after the disaster in Haiti,,we had an earthquake map that showed,before and after pictures from the sky.,This wonderful one which I don't have time to show you,is taking hyper-local blogs in real time,and mapping those stories, those entries,to the places that are referred to on the blogs.,It's wonderful. 
 But I'm going to show you some more candy sort of stuff. 
 So, we see the imagery, of course,,not stopping at the sky.,These little green bubbles represent,photosynths that users have made.,I'm not going to dive into them either, but photosynths are integrated into the map.,Everything that's cased in blue,is an area where we've taken imagery on the ground as well. 
 And so, when you fly down -- 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. When you fly down to the ground,,and you see this kind of panoramic imagery,,the first thing that you might notice is that it's not just a picture,,there's just as much three-dimensional understanding of this environment,as there is of the three-dimensional city from above,,so if I click on something to get a closer view of it,,then, the fact that that transition looks as it does,,is a function of all of that geometry,,all of that 3D understanding behind this model. 
 Now, I'll show you a fun app,that -- we've been working on a collaboration with our friends at Flickr.,This takes Flickr, georegistered imagery,and uses photosynth-like processes,to connect that imagery to our imagery, so --,I'm not sure if that's the one I actually meant to pull up, but -- 
 (Laughter) 
 But notice -- this is, of course, a popular tourist site,,and there are lots of photos around here,,and these photos are all taken at different times.,So this one was taken around five.,So that's the Flickr photo,,that's our imagery.,So you really see how this kind of crowd-sourced imagery,is integrating, in a very deep way, into the map itself. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 There are several reasons why this is interesting,and one of them, of course, is time travel.,And I'm not going to show you some of the wonderful historic imagery in here,,but there are some with horses and carriages and so on as well.,But what's cool about this is that, not only is it augmenting,this visual representation of the world,with things that are coming in from users,,but it also is the foundation for augmented reality,,and that's something that I'll be showing you more of in just a moment. 
 Now I just made a transition indoors. That's also interesting.,OK, notice there's now a roof above us.,We're inside the Pike Place Market.,And this is something that we're able to do with a backpack camera,,so, we're now not only imaging in the street,with this camera on tops of cars,,but we're also imaging inside.,And from here, we're able to do the same sorts of registration,,not only of still images, but also of video. 
 So this is something that we're now going to try,for the first time, live,,and this is really, truly, very frightening. 
 (Laughter) 
 OK. 
 (Ringing) 
 All right, guys, are you there? 
 (Noise) 
 All right. I'm hitting it. I'm punching play.,I'm live. All right. There we go.,So, these are our friends in Pike Place Market, the lab. 
 (Applause) 
 So they're broadcasting this live.,OK, George, can you pan back over to the corner market?,Because I want to show points of interest.,No, no. The other way.,Yeah, yeah, back to the corner, back to the corner.,I don't want to see you guys yet.,OK, OK, back to the corner, back to the corner, back to the corner.,OK, never mind. 
 What I wanted to show you was these points of interest,over here on top of the image,because what that gives you a sense of is the way,,if you're actually on the spot,,you can think about this --,this is taking a step in addition to augmented reality. 
 What the hell are you guys -- oh, sorry. 
 (Laughter) 
 We're doing two different --,OK, I'm hanging up now.,We're doing two different things here.,One of them is to take that real ... 
 (Laughter) 
 All right, let me just take a moment and thank the team.,They've done a fantastic job of pulling this together. 
 (Applause) 
 I'm going to abandon them now and walk back outside.,And while I walk outside, I'll just mention that,here we're using this for telepresence,,but you can equally well use this,on the spot, for augmented reality.,When you use it on the spot, it means that,you're able to bring all of that metadata,and information about the world to you.,So here, we're taking the extra step of also broadcasting it.,That was being broadcast, by the way, on a 4G network,from the market. 
 All right, and now there's one last TED talk,that Microsoft has given in the past several years.,And that's Curtis Wong, WorldWide Telescope.,So, we're going to head over to the dumpsters,,where it's traditional, after a long day at the market,,to go out for a break, but also stare up at the sky.,This is the integration,of WorldWide Telescope into our maps. 
 (Applause) 
 This is the current -- thank you --,this is the current time. If we scrub the time,,then we can see how the sky will look at different times,,and we can get all of this very detailed,information about different times, different dates:,Let's move the moon a little higher in the sky,,maybe change the date.,I would like to kind of zoom in on the moon.,So, this is an astronomically complete,representation of the sky,integrated right into the Earth. 
 All right now, I've overrun my time,,so I've got to stop.,Thank you all very much. 
 (Applause)It's a great honor today,to share with you,The Digital Universe,,which was created for humanity,to really see where we are,in the universe.,And so I think we can roll the video that we have. 
 [The Himalayas.] 
 (Music) 
 The flat horizon that we've evolved with,has been a metaphor for the,infinite: unbounded resources,and unlimited capacity,for disposal of waste.,It wasn't until we really,left Earth,,got above the atmosphere,and had seen the horizon,bend back on itself,,that we could understand our planet,as a limited condition.,The Digital Universe Atlas,has been built,at the American Museum of Natural History,over the past 12 years.,We maintain that,,put that together,as a project,to really chart the universe,across all scales.,What we see here are satellites around the Earth,and the Earth in proper registration,against the universe, as we see.,NASA supported this work,12 years ago,as part of the rebuilding,of the Hayden Planetarium,so that we would share this with the world. 
 The Digital Universe is the basis,of our space show productions that we do --,our main space shows in the dome.,But what you see here,is the result of, actually, internships,that we hosted with Linkoping University,in Sweden.,I've had 12 students work on this,for their graduate work,,and the result has been this software called Uniview,and a company called SCISS in Sweden.,This software,allows interactive use,,so this actual flight path,and movie that we see here,was actually flown live.,I captured this live from my laptop,in a cafe called Earth Matters,on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, where I live,,and it was done,as a collaborative project,with the Rubin Museum of Himalayan Art,for an exhibit,on comparative cosmology. 
 And so as we move out,,we see continuously from our planet,all the way out into the realm of galaxies, as we see here,,light-travel time, giving you a sense of how far away we are.,As we move out,,the light from these distant galaxies,have taken so long,,we're essentially backing up into the past.,We back so far up,we're finally seeing a containment around us --,the afterglow of the Big Bang.,This is the WMAP,microwave background,that we see.,We'll fly outside it here, just to see this sort of containment.,If we were outside this,,it would almost be meaningless, in the sense as before time.,But this our containment of the visible universe.,We know the universe is bigger than that which we can see. 
 Coming back quickly,,we see here the radio sphere that we jumped out of in the beginning,,but these are positions,,the latest positions of exoplanets,that we've mapped,,and our sun here, obviously, with our own solar system.,What you're going to see -- we're going to have to jump in here pretty quickly,between several orders of magnitude,to get down to where we see the solar system --,these are the paths of,Voyager 1, Voyager 2, Pioneer 11 and Pioneer 10,,the first four spacecraft to have left the solar system.,Coming in closer,,picking up Earth,,orbit of the Moon, and we see the Earth.,This map can be updated,,and we can add in new data. 
 I know Dr. Carolyn Porco is the camera P.I.,for the Cassini mission.,But here we see the complex trajectory,of the Cassini mission,color coded for different mission phases,,ingeniously developed so that,45 encounters with the largest moon, Titan,,which is larger that the planet Mercury,,diverts the orbit into different parts of mission phase. 
 This software allows us to come close,and look at parts of this.,This software can also be networked between domes.,We have a growing user base of this,,and we network domes.,And we can network between domes and classrooms.,We're actually sharing tours of the universe,with the first sub-Saharan,planetarium in Ghana,as well as,new libraries that have been built,in the ghettos in Columbia,and a high school,in Cambodia.,And the Cambodians have,actually controlled the Hayden Planetarium from their high school. 
 This is an image from Saturday,,photographed by the Aqua satellite, but through the Uniview software.,So you're seeing the edge of the Earth.,This is Nepal.,This is, in fact, right here is the valley of Lhasa,,right here in Tibet.,But we can see the haze,from fires and so forth in the Ganges valley,down below in India.,This is Nepal and Tibet. 
 And just in closing,,I'd just like to say this beautiful world that we live on --,here we see a bit of the snow,that some of you may have had to brave in coming out --,so I'd like to just say,that what the world needs now,is a sense of being able to,look at ourselves in this much larger condition now,and a much larger sense of what home is.,Because our home is the universe,,and we are the universe, essentially.,We carry that in us.,And to be able to see our context,in this larger sense at all scales,helps us all, I think, in understanding,where we are and who we are in the universe. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Ladies and gentlemen, at TEDnwe talk a lot about leadership,and how to make a movement.,So let's watch a movement happen,nstart to finish,,in under three minutes,and dissect some lessons from it. 
 First, of course you know,,a leader needs the gutsnto stand out and be ridiculed.,What he's doing is so easy to follow.,Here's his first followernwith a crucial role;,he's going to show everyonenelse how to follow. 
 Now, notice that the leadernembraces him as an equal.,Now it's not about the leader anymore;,it's about them, plural.,Now, there he is calling to his friends.,Now, if you notice that the first follower,is actually an underestimated formnof leadership in itself.,It takes guts to stand out like that.,The first follower is what transformsna lone nut into a leader. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 And here comes a second follower.,Now it's not a lone nut,nit's not two nuts --,three is a crowd, and a crowd is news.,So a movement must be public.,It's important to shownnot just the leader, but the followers,,because you find that new followersnemulate the followers, not the leader. 
 Now, here come two more people,nand immediately after,,three more people.,Now we've got momentum.nThis is the tipping point.,Now we've got a movement. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, notice that, as more people join in,,it's less risky.,So those that were sittingnon the fence before,now have no reason not to.,They won't stand out,nthey won't be ridiculed,,but they will be partnof the in-crowd if they hurry. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, over the next minute,,you'll see all of those that prefernto stick with the crowd,because eventually they would benridiculed for not joining in.,And that's how you make a movement. 
 But let's recap some lessons from this.,So first, if you are the type,,like the shirtless dancing guynthat is standing alone,,remember the importance of nurturingnyour first few followers as equals,so it's clearlynabout the movement, not you. 
 (Laughter) 
 Okay, but we might have missednthe real lesson here. 
 The biggest lesson, if you noticed --,did you catch it? --,is that leadership is over-glorified.,Yes, it was the shirtless guynwho was first,,and he'll get all the credit,,but it was really the first follower,that transformed the lone nutninto a leader.,So, as we're toldnthat we should all be leaders,,that would be really ineffective. 
 If you really carenabout starting a movement,,have the courage to follownand show others how to follow.,And when you find a lone nutndoing something great,,have the guts to be the first onento stand up and join in.,And what a perfect placento do that, at TED. 
 Thanks. 
 (Applause)The greatest irony in global health,is that the poorest countries,carry the largest disease burden.,If we resize the countries of the globe,in proportion to the subject of interest,,we see that Sub-Saharan Africa,is the worst hit region by HIV/AIDS.,This is the most devastating epidemic of our time.,We also see that this region,has the least capability in terms of dealing with the disease.,There are very few doctors,and, quite frankly, these countries do not have the resources,that are needed to cope,with such epidemics. 
 So what the Western countries,,developed countries, have generously done,is they have proposed to provide free drugs,to all people in Third World countries,who actually can't afford these medications.,And this has already saved millions of lives,,and it has prevented entire economies,from capsizing in Sub-Saharan Africa. 
 But there is a fundamental problem,that is killing the efforts,in fighting this disease,,because if you keep throwing,drugs out at people,who don't have diagnostic services,,you end up creating a problem of drug resistance.,This is already beginning to happen in Sub-Saharan Africa.,The problem is that,,what begins as a tragedy in the Third World,could easily become a global problem.,And the last thing we want to see,is drug-resistant strains of HIV,popping up all over the world,,because it will make treatment more expensive,and it could also restore,the pre-ARV carnage of HIV/AIDS. 
 I experienced this firsthand,as a high school student in Uganda.,This was in the 90s,during the peak of the HIV epidemic,,before there were any ARVs in Sub-Saharan Africa.,And during that time, I actually lost more relatives,,as well as the teachers who taught me,,to HIV/AIDS.,So this became one of the driving passions of my life,,to help find real solutions,that could address these kinds of problems. 
 We all know about the miracle of miniaturization.,Back in the day, computers used to fill this entire room,,and people actually used to work inside the computers.,But what electronic miniaturization has done,is that it has allowed people to shrink,technology into a cell phone.,And I'm sure everyone here enjoys cell phones,that can actually be used in the remote areas of the world,,in the Third World countries.,The good news is that the same technology,that allowed miniaturization of electronics,is now allowing us to miniaturize,biological laboratories. 
 So, right now, we can actually miniaturize,biological and chemistry laboratories,onto microfluidic chips.,I was very lucky to come,to the US right after high school,,and was able to work on this technology,and develop some devices.,This is a microfluidic chip that I developed.,A close look at how the technology works:,These are channels that are about the size of a human hair --,so you have integrated valves, pumps, mixers and injectors --,so you can fit entire diagnostic experiments,onto a microfluidic system. 
 So what I plan to do with this technology,is to actually take the current state,of the technology,and build an HIV kit,in a microfluidic system.,So, with one microfluidic chip,,which is the size of an iPhone,,you can actually diagnose,100 patients at the same time.,For each patient, we will be able to do,up to 100 different viral loads per patient.,And this is only done in four hours,,50 times faster than the current state of the art,,at a cost that will be five to 500 times cheaper,than the current options.,So this will allow us to create,personalized medicines in the Third World,at a cost that is actually achievable,and make the world a safer place. 
 I invite your interest,as well as your involvement,in driving this vision,to a point of practical reality. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)We're 25, 26 years after,the advent of the Macintosh,,which was an astoundingly seminal event,in the history,of human-machine interface,and in computation in general.,It fundamentally changed the way,that people thought about computation,,thought about computers,,how they used them and who and how many people were able to use them.,It was such a radical change, in fact,,that the early Macintosh development team,in '82, '83, '84,had to write an entirely new operating system from the ground up.,Now, this is an interesting little message,,and it's a lesson that has since, I think,,been forgotten or lost or something,,and that is, namely, that the OS is the interface.,The interface is the OS.,It's like the land and the king (i.e. Arthur) they're inseparable, they are one.,And to write a new operating system was not a capricious matter.,It wasn't just a matter of tuning up some graphics routines.,There were no graphics routines. There were no mouse drivers.,So it was a necessity. 
 But in the quarter-century since then,,we've seen all of the fundamental,supporting technologies go berserk.,So memory capacity and disk capacity,have been multiplied by something between 10,000 and a million.,Same thing for processor speeds.,Networks, we didn't have networks at all,at the time of the Macintosh's introduction,,and that has become the single most salient aspect,of how we live with computers.,And, of course, graphics: Today,84 dollars and 97 cents at Best Buy,buys you more graphics power,than you could have gotten for a million bucks from SGI only a decade ago.,So we've got that incredible ramp-up.,Then, on the side, we've got the Web,and, increasingly, the cloud,,which is fantastic,,but also -- in the regard in which an interface is fundamental --,kind of a distraction.,So we've forgotten to invent new interfaces.,Certainly we've seen in recent years a lot of change in that regard,,and people are starting to wake up about that.,So what happens next? Where do we go from there? 
 The problem, as we see it,,has to do with a single, simple word: "space,",or a single, simple phrase:,"real world geometry.",Computers and the programming languages,that we talk to them in, that we teach them in,,are hideously insensate when it comes to space.,They don't understand real world space.,It's a funny thing because the rest of us occupy it quite frequently and quite well.,They also don't understand time, but that's a matter for a separate talk. 
 So what happens if you start to,explain space to them?,One thing you might get is something like the Luminous Room.,The Luminous Room is a system,in which it's considered that,input and output spaces are co-located.,That's a strangely simple,,and yet unexplored idea, right?,When you use a mouse, your hand is down here on the mouse pad.,It's not even on the same plane as what you're talking about:,The pixels are up on the display.,So here was a room in which all the walls, floors, ceilings,,pets, potted plants, whatever was in there,,were capable, not only of display but of sensing as well.,And that means input and output are in the same space,enabling stuff like this.,That's a digital storage in a physical container.,The contract is the same,as with real word objects in real world containers.,Has to come back out, whatever you put in.,This little design experiment,that was a small office here knew a few other tricks as well.,If you presented it with a chess board,,it tried to figure out what you might mean by that.,And if there was nothing for them to do,,the chess pieces eventually got bored,and hopped away. 
 The academics who were overseeing this work,thought that that was too frivolous,,so we built deadly serious applications,like this optics prototyping workbench,in which a toothpaste cap on a cardboard box,becomes a laser.,The beam splitters and lenses are represented by physical objects,,and the system projects down the laser beam path.,So you've got an interface that has no interface.,You operate the world as you operate the real world,,which is to say, with your hands.,Similarly, a digital wind tunnel with digital wind,flowing from right to left --,not that remarkable in a sense; we didn't invent the mathematics.,But if you displayed that on a CRT or flat panel display,,it would be meaningless to hold up an arbitrary object,,a real world object in that.,Here, the real world merges with the simulation. 
 And finally, to pull out all the stops,,this is a system called Urp, for urban planners,,in which we give architects and urban planners back,the models that we confiscated,when we insisted that they use CAD systems.,And we make the machine meet them half way.,It projects down digital shadows, as you see here.,And if you introduce tools like this inverse clock,,then you can control the sun's position in the sky.,That's 8 a.m. shadows.,They get a little shorter at 9 a.m.,There you are, swinging the sun around.,Short shadows at noon and so forth.,And we built up a series of tools like this.,There are inter-shadowing studies,that children can operate,,even though they don't know anything about urban planning:,To move a building, you simply reach out your hand and you move the building.,A material wand makes the building,into a sort of Frank Gehry thing that reflects light in all directions.,Are you blinding passers by and motorists on the freeways?,A zoning tool connects distant structures, a building and a roadway.,Are you going to get sued by the zoning commission? And so forth.,Now, if these ideas seem familiar,or perhaps even a little dated,,that's great; they should seem familiar. 
 This work is 15 years old.,This stuff was undertaken at MIT and the Media Lab,under the incredible direction of Professor Hiroshi Ishii,,director of the Tangible Media Group.,But it was that work that was seen,by Alex McDowell,,one of the world's legendary production designers.,But Alex was preparing a little, sort of obscure, indie, arthouse film,called "Minority Report" for Steven Spielberg,,and invited us to come out from MIT,and design the interfaces,that would appear in that film.,And the great thing about it was,that Alex was so dedicated to the idea of verisimilitude,,the idea that the putative 2054,that we were painting in the film be believable,,that he allowed us to take on that design work,as if it were an R&D effort.,And the result is sort of,gratifyingly perpetual.,People still reference those sequences in "Minority Report",when they talk about new UI design.,So this led full circle, in a strange way,,to build these ideas into what we believe,is the necessary future of human machine interface:,the Spatial Operating Environment, we call it. 
 So here we have a bunch of stuff, some images.,And, using a hand,,we can actually exercise six degrees of freedom,,six degrees of navigational control.,And it's fun to fly through Mr. Beckett's eye.,And you can come back out,through the scary orangutan.,And that's all well and good.,Let's do something a little more difficult.,Here, we have a whole bunch of disparate images.,We can fly around them.,So navigation is a fundamental issue.,You have to be able to navigate in 3D.,Much of what we want computers to help us with in the first place,is inherently spatial.,And the part that isn't spatial can often be spatialized,to allow our wetware to make greater sense of it.,Now we can distribute this stuff in many different ways.,So we can throw it out like that. Let's reset it.,We can organize it this way. 
 And, of course, it's not just about navigation,,but about manipulation as well.,So if we don't like stuff,,or we're intensely curious about,Ernst Haeckel's scientific falsifications,,we can pull them out like that.,And then if it's time for analysis, we can pull back a little bit,and ask for a different distribution.,Let's just come down a bit,and fly around.,So that's a different way to look at stuff.,If you're of a more analytical nature,then you might want, actually, to look at this,as a color histogram.,So now we've got the stuff color-sorted,,angle maps onto color.,And now, if we want to select stuff,,3D, space,,the idea that we're tracking hands in real space,becomes really important because we can reach in,,not in 2D, not in fake 2D, but in actual 3D.,Here are some selection planes.,And we'll perform this Boolean operation,because we really love yellow and tapirs on green grass. 
 So, from there to the world of real work.,Here's a logistics system,,a small piece of one that we're currently building.,There're a lot of elements.,And one thing that's very important is to combine traditional tabular data,with three-dimensional and geospatial information.,So here's a familiar place.,And we'll bring this back here for a second.,Maybe select a little bit of that.,And bring out this graph.,And we should, now,,be able to fly in here,and have a closer look.,These are logistics elements,that are scattered across the United States. 
 One thing that three-dimensional interactions,and the general idea of imbuing,computation with space affords you,is a final destruction of that unfortunate,one-to-one pairing between human beings and computers.,That's the old way, that's the old mantra:,one machine, one human, one mouse, one screen.,Well, that doesn't really cut it anymore.,In the real world, we have people who collaborate;,we have people who have to work together,,and we have many different displays.,And we might want to look at these various images.,We might want to ask for some help. 
 The author of this new pointing device,is sitting over there,,so I can pull this from there to there.,These are unrelated machines, right?,So the computation is space soluble and network soluble.,So I'm going to leave that over there,because I have a question for Paul.,Paul is the designer of this wand, and maybe its easiest,for him to come over here and tell me in person what's going on.,So let me get some of these out of the way.,Let's pull this apart:,I'll go ahead and explode it.,Kevin, can you help?,Let me see if I can help us find the circuit board.,Mind you, it's a sort of gratuitous field-stripping exercise,,but we do it in the lab all the time.,All right.,So collaborative work, whether it's immediately co-located,or distant and distinct, is always important.,And again, that stuff,needs to be undertaken in the context of space. 
 And finally, I'd like to leave you with a glimpse,that takes us back to the world of imagery.,This is a system called TAMPER,,which is a slightly whimsical look,at what the future of editing,and media manipulation systems might be.,We at Oblong believe that media should be,accessible in much more fine-grained form.,So we have a large number of movies,stuck inside here.,And let's just pick out a few elements.,We can zip through them,as a possibility.,We can grab elements off the front,,where upon they reanimate, come to life,,and drag them down onto the table here.,We'll go over to Jacques Tati here,and grab our blue friend,and put him down on the table as well.,We may need more than one.,And we probably need,,well, we probably need a cowboy,to be quite honest.,(Laughter),Yeah, let's,take that one.,(Laughter),You see, cowboys and French farce people,don't go well together, and the system knows that. 
 Let me leave with one final thought,,and that is that,one of the greatest English language writers,of the last three decades,suggested that great art is always a gift.,And he wasn't talking about whether the novel costs 24.95 [dollars],,or whether you have to spring 70 million bucks,to buy the stolen Vermeer;,he was talking about the circumstances of its creation,and of its existence.,And I think that it's time that we asked,for the same from technology.,Technology is capable of,expressing and being imbued with,a certain generosity,,and we need to demand that, in fact.,For some of this kind of technology,,ground center is,a combination of design, which is crucially important.,We can't have advances in technology any longer,unless design is integrated from the very start.,And, as well, as of efficacy, agency.,We're, as human beings, the creatures that create,,and we should make sure that our machines aid us in that task,and are built in that same image. 
 So I will leave you with that. Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: So to ask the obvious question --,actually this is from Bill Gates --,when? (John Underkoffler: When?),CA: When real? When for us, not just in a lab and on a stage?,Can it be for every man, or is this just for corporations and movie producers? 
 JU: No, it has to be for every human being.,That's our goal entirely.,We won't have succeeded,unless we take that next big step.,I mean it's been 25 years.,Can there really be only one interface? There can't. 
 CA: But does that mean that, at your desk or in your home,,you need projectors, cameras?,You know, how can it work? 
 JU: No, this stuff will be built into the bezel of every display.,It'll be built into architecture.,The gloves go away in a matter of months or years.,So this is the inevitability about it. 
 CA: So, in your mind, five years time,,someone can buy this as part of,a standard computer interface? 
 JU: I think in five years time when you buy a computer,,you'll get this. 
 CA: Well that's cool.,(Applause),The world has a habit of surprising us as to how these things are actually used.,What do you think, what in your mind is the first killer app for this? 
 JU: That's a good question, and we ask ourselves that every day.,At the moment, our early-adopter customers --,and these systems are deployed out in the real world --,do all the big data intensive, data heavy problems with it.,So, whether it's logistics and supply chain management,or natural gas and resource extraction,,financial services, pharmaceuticals, bioinformatics,,those are the topics right now, but that's not a killer app.,And I understand what you're asking. 
 CA: C'mon, c'mon. Martial arts, games. C'mon.,(Laughter),John, thank you for making science-fiction real. 
 JU: It's been a great pleasure.,Thank you to you all. 
 (Applause)Thank you. I have two missions here today.,The first is to tell you something about pollen, I hope,,and to convince you that it's more than just something that gets up your nose.,And, secondly, to convince you,that every home really ought to have a scanning electron microscope.,(Laughter),Pollen is a flower's way of making more flowers.,It carries male sex cells,from one flower to another.,This gives us genetic diversity,,or at least it gives the plants genetic diversity.,And it's really rather better not to mate with yourself.,That's probably true of humans as well, mostly. 
 Pollen is produced by the anthers of flowers.,Each anther can carry up to 100,000 grains of pollen,,so, it's quite prolific stuff.,And it isn't just bright flowers,that have pollen; it's also trees and grasses.,And remember that all our cereal crops are grasses as well. 
 Here is a scanning electron micrograph of a grain of pollen.,The little hole in the middle, we'll come to a bit later,,but that's for the pollen tube,to come out later on. A very tiny tube.,So, that's 20 micrometers across,,that pollen grain there.,That's about a 50th of a millimeter.,But not all pollen is quite so simple looking. 
 This is Morina. This is a plant --,which I've always thought to be rather tedious --,named after Morin,,who was an enterprising French gardener,,who issued the first seed catalog,in 1621.,But anyway, take a look at its pollen.,This is amazing, I think.,That little hole in the middle there is for the pollen tube,,and when the pollen finds its special female spot,in another Morina flower,,just on the right species, what happens?,Like I said, pollen carries the male sex cells.,If you actually didn't realize that plants have sex,,they have rampant, promiscuous,and really quite interesting and curious sex. Really.,(Laughter) A lot. 
 My story is actually not about plant propagation,,but about pollen itself.,"So, what are pollen's properties?" I hear you ask.,First of all, pollen is tiny. Yes we know that.,It's also very biologically active,,as anyone with hay fever will understand.,Now, pollen from plants, which are wind-dispersed --,like trees and grasses and so on --,tend to cause the most hay fever.,And the reason for that is they've got to chuck out,masses and masses of pollen to have any chance,of the pollen reaching another plant of the same species. 
 Here are some examples --,they're very smooth if you look at them --,of tree pollen that is meant to be carried by the wind.,Again -- this time, sycamore -- wind-dispersed.,So, trees: very boring flowers,,not really trying to attract insects.,Cool pollen, though.,This one I particularly like.,This is the Monterey Pine, which has little air sacks,to make the pollen carry even further.,Remember, that thing is just about 30 micrometers across. 
 Now, it's much more efficient if you can get insects to do your bidding.,This is a bee's leg,with the pollen glommed onto it from a mallow plant.,And this is the outrageous and beautiful,flower of the mangrove palm.,Very showy, to attract lots of insects to do its bidding.,The pollen has little barbs on it,,if we look.,Now, those little barbs,obviously stick to the insects well,,but there is something else that we can tell from this photograph,,and that is that you might be able to see a fracture line,across what would be the equator of this, if it was the Earth.,That tells me that it's actually been fossilized, this pollen.,And I'm rather proud to say,that this was found just near London, and that 55 million years ago,London was full of mangroves.,Isn't that cool?,(Laughter) 
 Okay, so this is another species evolved to be dispersed by insects.,You can tell that from the little barbs on there.,All these pictures were taken with a scanning electron microscope,,actually in the lab at Kew Laboratories.,No coincidence that these were taken,by Rob Kesseler, who is an artist,,and I think it's someone with a design and artistic eye,like him that has managed to bring out the best in pollen.,(Laughter) 
 Now, all this diversity,means that you can look at a pollen grain,and tell what species it came from,,and that's actually quite handy if you,maybe have a sample and you want to see where it came from.,So, different species of plants,grow in different places,,and some pollen carries further than others.,So, if you have a pollen sample,,then in principle, you should be able to tell,where that sample came from.,And this is where it gets interesting for forensics. 
 Pollen is tiny. It gets on to things, and it sticks to them.,So, not only does each type of pollen look different,,but each habitat has a different combination of plants.,A different pollen signature, if you like,,or a different pollen fingerprint.,By looking at the proportions and combinations,of different kinds of pollen in a sample,,you can tell very precisely where it came from.,This is some pollen embedded in a cotton shirt,,similar to the one that I'm wearing now.,Now, much of the pollen will still be there,after repeated washings.,Where has it been?,Four very different habitats might look similar,,but they've got very different pollen signatures.,Actually this one is particularly easy, these pictures were all taken,in different countries. 
 But pollen forensics can be very subtle.,It's being used now to track,where counterfeit drugs have been made,,where banknotes have come from,,to look at the provenance of antiques,and see that they really did come from the place,the seller said they did.,And murder suspects have been tracked,using their clothing,,certainly in the U.K., to within an area,that's small enough that you can send in tracker dogs,to find the murder victim.,So, you can tell from a piece of clothing,to within about a kilometer or so,,where that piece of clothing has been recently,and then send in dogs.,And finally, in a rather grizzly way,,the Bosnia war crimes;,some of the people brought to trial were brought to trial,because of the evidence from pollen,,which showed that bodies had been buried,,exhumed and then reburied somewhere else. 
 I hope I've opened your eyes,,if you'll excuse the visual pun, (Laughter),to some of pollen's secrets.,This is a horse chestnut.,There is an invisible beauty all around us,,each grain with a story to tell ...,each of us, in fact, with a story to tell,from the pollen fingerprint that's upon us.,Thank you to the colleagues at Kew,,and thank you to palynologists everywhere.,(Applause)In my industry,,we believe that images can change the world.,Okay, we're naive, we're bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.,The truth is that we know that the,images themselves don't change the world,,but we're also aware that, since the beginning of photography,,images have provoked reactions in people,,and those reactions have caused change to happen. 
 So let's begin with a group of images.,I'd be extremely surprised,if you didn't recognize many or most of them.,They're best described as iconic:,so iconic, perhaps, they're cliches.,In fact, they're so well-known,that you might even recognize them,in a slightly or somewhat different form. 
 (Laughter) 
 But I think we're looking for something more.,We're looking for something more.,We're looking for images that shine,an uncompromising light on crucial issues,,images that transcend borders, that transcend religions,,images that provoke us,to step up and do something --,in other words, to act.,Well, this image you've all seen.,It changed our view of the physical world.,We had never seen our planet from this perspective before.,Many people credit,a lot of the birth of the environmental movement,to our seeing the planet like this,for the first time --,its smallness, its fragility. 
 Forty years later, this group, more than most,,are well aware of the destructive power,that our species can wield over our environment.,And at last, we appear to be doing something about it.,This destructive power takes many different forms.,For example, these images taken by Brent Stirton,in the Congo.,These gorillas were murdered, some would even say crucified,,and unsurprisingly,,they sparked international outrage.,Most recently,,we've been tragically reminded of the destructive power of nature itself,with the recent earthquake in Haiti. 
 Well, I think what is far worse,is man's destructive power over man.,Samuel Pisar, an Auschwitz survivor, said,,and I'll quote him,,"The Holocaust teaches us that nature,,even in its cruelest moments,,is benign in comparison with man,,when he loses his moral compass and his reason." 
 There's another kind of crucifixion.,The horrifying images from Abu Ghraib,as well as the images from Guantanamo,had a profound impact.,The publication of those images,,as opposed to the images themselves,,caused a government to change its policies.,Some would argue that it is those images,that did more to fuel the insurgency in Iraq,than virtually any other single act.,Furthermore, those images forever removed,the so-called moral high ground of the occupying forces. 
 Let's go back a little.,In the 1960s and 1970s,,the Vietnam War was basically shown,in America's living rooms day in, day out.,News photos brought people face to face,with the victims of the war: a little girl burned by napalm,,a student killed by the National Guard,at Kent State University in Ohio during a protest.,In fact, these images became,the voices of protest themselves. 
 Now, images have power,to shed light of understanding,on suspicion, ignorance,,and in particular -- I've given a lot of talks on this,but I'll just show one image --,the issue of HIV/AIDS.,In the 1980s, the stigmatization of people with the disease,was an enormous barrier,to even discussing or addressing it.,A simple act, in 1987, of the most famous woman in the world,,the Princess of Wales, touching,an HIV/AIDS infected baby,did a great deal, especially in Europe, to stop that.,She, better than most, knew the power of an image. 
 So when we are confronted by a powerful image,,we all have a choice:,We can look away, or we can address the image.,Thankfully, when these photos appeared in,The Guardian in 1998,,they put a lot of focus and attention and, in the end, a lot of money,towards the Sudan famine relief efforts.,Did the images change the world?,No, but they had a major impact.,Images often push us to question our core beliefs,and our responsibilities to each other.,We all saw those images after Katrina,,and I think for millions of people,they had a very strong impact.,And I think it's very unlikely,that they were far from the minds of Americans,when they went to vote in November 2008. 
 Unfortunately, some very important images,are deemed too graphic or disturbing for us to see them.,I'll show you one photo here,,and it's a photo by Eugene Richards of an Iraq War veteran,from an extraordinary piece of work,,which has never been published, called War Is Personal.,But images don't need to be graphic,in order to remind us of the tragedy of war.,John Moore set up this photo at Arlington Cemetery.,After all the tense moments of conflict,in all the conflict zones of the world,,there's one photograph from a much quieter place,that haunts me still, much more than the others. 
 Ansel Adams said, and I'm going to disagree with him,,"You don't take a photograph, you make it.",In my view, it's not the photographer who makes the photo,,it's you.,We bring to each image,our own values, our own belief systems,,and as a result of that, the image resonates with us.,My company has 70 million images.,I have one image in my office.,Here it is.,I hope that the next time you see,an image that sparks something in you,,you'll better understand why,,and I know that speaking to this audience,,you'll definitely do something about it. 
 And thank you to all the photographers. 
 (Applause)We are drowning in news.,Reuters alone puts out,three and a half million news stories a year.,That's just one source. 
 My question is: How many of those stories,are actually going to matter in the long run?,That's the idea behind The Long News.,It's a project by The Long Now Foundation,,which was founded by TEDsters including,Kevin Kelly and Stewart Brand.,And what we're looking for is news stories that might still matter,50 or 100 or 10,000 years from now.,And when you look at the news through that filter,,a lot falls by the wayside. 
 To take the top stories from the A.P. this last year,,is this going to matter in a decade?,Or this?,Or this?,Really?,Is this going to matter in 50 or 100 years?,Okay, that was kind of cool.,(Laughter),But the top story of this past year was the economy,,and I'm just betting that, sooner or later,,this particular recession is going to be old news. 
 So, what kind of stories might,make a difference for the future?,Well, let's take science.,Someday, little robots will go,through our bloodstreams fixing things.,That someday is already here if you're a mouse.,Some recent stories:,nanobees zap tumors with real bee venom;,they're sending genes into the brain;,a robot they built that can crawl through the human body. 
 What about resources? How are we going to feed nine billion people?,We're having trouble feeding six billion today.,As we heard yesterday, there's over a billion people hungry.,Britain will starve without genetically modified crops.,Bill Gates, fortunately, has bet a billion on [agricultural] research. 
 What about global politics?,The world's going to be very different when and if China sets the agenda,,and they may.,They've overtaken the U.S. as the world's biggest car market,,they've overtaken Germany as the largest exporter,,and they've started doing DNA tests on kids,to choose their careers. 
 We're finding all kinds of ways to push back the limits of what we know.,Some recent discoveries:,There's an ant colony from Argentina that has now,spread to every continent but Antarctica;,there's a self-directed robot scientist that's made a discovery --,soon, science may no longer need us,,and life may no longer need us either;,a microbe wakes up after 120,000 years.,It seems that with or without us,,life will go on. 
 But my pick for the top Long News story of this past year,was this one: water found on the moon.,Makes it a lot easier to put a colony up there.,And if NASA doesn't do it, China might,,or somebody in this room might write a big check. 
 My point is this:,In the long run, some news stories,are more important than others.,(Applause)One thing the world needs,,one thing this country desperately needs,is a better way,of conducting our political debates.,We need to rediscover,the lost art of democratic argument.,(Applause),If you think about the arguments we have,,most of the time it's shouting matches,on cable television,,ideological food fights on the floor of Congress.,I have a suggestion.,Look at all the arguments we have these days,over health care,,over bonuses and bailouts on Wall Street,,over the gap between rich and poor,,over affirmative action and same-sex marriage.,Lying just beneath the surface,of those arguments,,with passions raging on all sides,,are big questions,of moral philosophy,,big questions of justice.,But we too rarely,articulate and defend,and argue about,those big moral questions in our politics. 
 So what I would like to do today,is have something of a discussion.,First, let me take,a famous philosopher,who wrote about those questions,of justice and morality,,give you a very short lecture,on Aristotle of ancient Athens,,Aristotle's theory of justice,,and then have a discussion here,to see whether Aristotle's ideas,actually inform,the way we think and argue,about questions today.,So, are you ready for the lecture?,According to Aristotle,,justice means giving people what they deserve.,That's it; that's the lecture. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, you may say, well, that's obvious enough.,The real questions begin,when it comes to arguing about,who deserves what and why.,Take the example of flutes.,Suppose we're distributing flutes.,Who should get the best ones?,Let's see what people --,What would you say?,Who should get the best flute?,You can just call it out. 
 (Audience: Random.) 
 Michael Sandel: At random. You would do it by lottery.,Or by the first person to rush into the hall to get them.,Who else? 
 (Audience: The best flute players.) 
 MS: The best flute players. (Audience: The worst flute players.) 
 MS: The worst flute players.,How many say the best flute players?,Why?,Actually, that was Aristotle's answer too. 
 (Laughter) 
 But here's a harder question.,Why do you think,,those of you who voted this way,,that the best flutes should go to the best flute players? 
 Peter: The greatest benefit to all. 
 MS: The greatest benefit to all.,We'll hear better music,if the best flutes should go to the best flute players.,That's Peter? (Audience: Peter.) 
 MS: All right.,Well, it's a good reason.,We'll all be better off if good music is played,rather than terrible music.,But Peter,,Aristotle doesn't agree with you that that's the reason.,That's all right.,Aristotle had a different reason,for saying the best flutes should go to the best flute players.,He said,,that's what flutes are for --,to be played well.,He says that to reason about,just distribution of a thing,,we have to reason about,,and sometimes argue about,,the purpose of the thing,,or the social activity --,in this case, musical performance.,And the point, the essential nature,,of musical performance,is to produce excellent music.,It'll be a happy byproduct,that we'll all benefit.,But when we think about justice,,Aristotle says,,what we really need to think about,is the essential nature of the activity in question,and the qualities that are worth,honoring and admiring and recognizing.,One of the reasons,that the best flute players should get the best flutes,is that musical performance,is not only to make the rest of us happy,,but to honor,and recognize,the excellence,of the best musicians. 
 Now, flutes may seem ... the distribution of flutes,may seem a trivial case.,Let's take a contemporary example,of the dispute about justice.,It had to do with golf.,Casey Martin -- a few years ago,,Casey Martin --,did any of you hear about him?,He was a very good golfer,,but he had a disability.,He had a bad leg, a circulatory problem,,that made it very painful,for him to walk the course.,In fact, it carried risk of injury.,He asked the PGA,,the Professional Golfers' Association,,for permission to use a golf cart,in the PGA tournaments.,They said, "No.,Now that would give you an unfair advantage.",He sued,,and his case went all the way,to the Supreme Court, believe it or not,,the case over the golf cart,,because the law says,that the disabled,must be accommodated,,provided the accommodation does not,change the essential nature,of the activity.,He says, "I'm a great golfer.,I want to compete.,But I need a golf cart,to get from one hole to the next." 
 Suppose you were,on the Supreme Court.,Suppose you were deciding,the justice of this case.,How many here would say,that Casey Martin does have a right to use a golf cart?,And how many say, no, he doesn't?,All right, let's take a poll, show of hands.,How many would rule in favor of Casey Martin?,And how many would not? How many would say he doesn't?,All right, we have a good division of opinion here.,Someone who would not,grant Casey Martin the right to a golf cart,,what would be your reason?,Raise your hand, and we'll try to get you a microphone.,What would be your reason? 
 (Audience: It'd be an unfair advantage.) 
 MS: It would be an unfair advantage,if he gets to ride in a golf cart.,All right, those of you,,I imagine most of you who would not give him the golf cart,worry about an unfair advantage.,What about those of you who say,he should be given a golf cart?,How would you answer the objection?,Yes, all right. 
 Audience: The cart's not part of the game. 
 MS: What's your name? (Audience: Charlie.) 
 MS: Charlie says --,We'll get Charlie a microphone in case someone wants to reply.,Tell us, Charlie,,why would you say he should be able to use a golf cart? 
 Charlie: The cart's not part of the game. 
 MS: But what about walking from hole to hole? 
 Charlie: It doesn't matter; it's not part of the game. 
 MS: Walking the course is not part of the game of golf? 
 Charlie: Not in my book, it isn't. 
 MS: All right. Stay there, Charlie. 
 (Laughter) 
 Who has an answer for Charlie?,All right, who has an answer for Charlie?,What would you say? 
 Audience: The endurance element is a very important part of the game,,walking all those holes. 
 MS: Walking all those holes?,That's part of the game of golf? (Audience: Absolutely.) 
 MS: What's your name? (Audience: Warren.) 
 MS: Warren.,Charlie, what do you say to Warren? 
 Charley: I'll stick to my original thesis. 
 (Laughter) 
 MS: Warren, are you a golfer? 
 Warren: I am not a golfer. 
 Charley: And I am. (MS: Okay.),(Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 You know,,it's interesting.,In the case, in the lower court,,they brought in golfing greats,to testify on this very issue.,Is walking the course essential to the game?,And they brought in Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer.,And what do you suppose they all said?,Yes. They agreed with Warren.,They said, yes, walking the course,is strenuous physical exercise.,The fatigue factor is an important part of golf.,And so it would change,the fundamental nature of the game,to give him the golf cart.,Now, notice,,something interesting --,Well, I should tell you about the Supreme Court first. 
 The Supreme Court,decided.,What do you suppose they said?,They said yes,,that Casey Martin must be provided a golf cart.,Seven to two, they ruled.,What was interesting about their ruling,and about the discussion we've just had,is that the discussion about,the right, the justice, of the matter,depended on,figuring out what is,the essential nature of golf.,And the Supreme Court justices,wrestled with that question.,And Justice Stevens, writing for the majority,,said he had read all about the history of golf,,and the essential point of the game,is to get very small ball from one place,into a hole,in as few strokes as possible,,and that walking was not essential, but incidental. 
 Now, there were two dissenters,,one of whom was Justice Scalia.,He wouldn't have granted the cart,,and he had a very interesting dissent.,It's interesting because,he rejected the Aristotelian premise,underlying the majority's opinion.,He said it's not possible,to determine the essential nature,of a game like golf.,Here's how he put it.,"To say that something is essential,is ordinarily to say that it is necessary,to the achievement of a certain object.,But since it is the very nature of a game,to have no object except amusement,,(Laughter),that is, what distinguishes games,from productive activity,,(Laughter),it is quite impossible to say,that any of a game's arbitrary rules,is essential." 
 So there you have Justice Scalia,taking on the Aristotelian premise,of the majority's opinion.,Justice Scalia's opinion,is questionable,for two reasons.,First, no real sports fan would talk that way.,(Laughter),If we had thought that the rules,of the sports we care about,are merely arbitrary,,rather than designed to call forth,the virtues and the excellences,that we think are worthy of admiring,,we wouldn't care about the outcome of the game.,It's also objectionable,on a second ground.,On the face of it,,it seemed to be -- this debate about the golf cart --,an argument about fairness,,what's an unfair advantage.,But if fairness were the only thing at stake,,there would have been an easy and obvious solution.,What would it be? (Audience: Let everyone use the cart.),Let everyone ride in a golf cart,if they want to.,Then the fairness objection goes away. 
 But letting everyone ride in a cart,would have been, I suspect,,more anathema,to the golfing greats,and to the PGA,,even than making an exception for Casey Martin.,Why?,Because what was at stake,in the dispute over the golf cart,was not only the essential nature of golf,,but, relatedly, the question:,What abilities,are worthy,of honor and recognition,as athletic talents?,Let me put the point,as delicately as possible:,Golfers are a little sensitive,about the athletic status of their game.,(Laughter),After all, there's no running or jumping,,and the ball stands still.,(Laughter),So if golfing is the kind of game,that can be played while riding around in a golf cart,,it would be hard to confer,on the golfing greats,the status that we confer,,the honor and recognition,that goes to truly great athletes.,That illustrates,that with golf,,as with flutes,,it's hard to decide the question,of what justice requires,,without grappling with the question,,"What is the essential nature,of the activity in question,,and what qualities,,what excellences,connected with that activity,,are worthy of honor and recognition?" 
 Let's take a final example,that's prominent in contemporary political debate:,same-sex marriage.,There are those who favor state recognition,only of traditional marriage,between one man and one woman,,and there are those who favor state recognition,of same-sex marriage.,How many here,favor the first policy:,the state should recognize traditional marriage only?,And how many favor the second, same-sex marriage?,Now, put it this way:,What ways of thinking,about justice and morality,underlie the arguments we have,over marriage?,The opponents of same-sex marriage say,that the purpose of marriage,,fundamentally, is procreation,,and that's what's worthy of honoring,and recognizing and encouraging.,And the defenders of same-sex marriage say no,,procreation is not the only purpose of marriage;,what about a lifelong, mutual, loving commitment?,That's really what marriage is about.,So with flutes, with golf carts,,and even with a fiercely contested question,like same-sex marriage,,Aristotle has a point.,Very hard to argue about justice,without first arguing,about the purpose of social institutions,and about what qualities are worthy,of honor and recognition. 
 So let's step back from these cases,and see how they shed light,on the way we might improve, elevate,,the terms of political discourse,in the United States,,and for that matter, around the world.,There is a tendency to think,that if we engage too directly,with moral questions in politics,,that's a recipe for disagreement,,and for that matter, a recipe for,intolerance and coercion.,So better to shy away from,,to ignore,,the moral and the religious convictions,that people bring to civic life.,It seems to me that our discussion,reflects the opposite,,that a better way,to mutual respect,is to engage directly,with the moral convictions,citizens bring to public life,,rather than to require,that people leave their deepest moral convictions,outside politics,before they enter.,That, it seems to me, is a way,to begin to restore,the art of democratic argument. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you very much.,Thanks. Thank you.,Chris.,Thanks, Chris. 
 Chris Anderson: From flutes to golf courses,to same-sex marriage --,that was a genius link.,Now look, you're a pioneer of open education.,Your lecture series was one of the first to do it big.,What's your vision for the next phase of this? 
 MS: Well, I think that it is possible.,In the classroom, we have arguments,on some of the most fiercely held,moral convictions that students have,about big public questions.,And I think we can do that in public life more generally.,And so my real dream would be,to take the public television series,that we've created of the course --,it's available now, online,,free for everyone anywhere in the world --,and to see whether we can partner with institutions,,at universities in China, in India,,in Africa, around the world,,to try to promote,civic education,and also a richer kind,of democratic debate. 
 CA: So you picture, at some point,,live, in real time,,you could have this kind of conversation, inviting questions,,but with people from China and India joining in? 
 MS: Right. We did a little bit of it here,with 1,500 people in Long Beach,,and we do it in a classroom at Harvard,with about 1,000 students.,Wouldn't it be interesting,to take this way,of thinking and arguing,,engaging seriously with big moral questions,,exploring cultural differences,and connect through a live video hookup,,students in Beijing and Mumbai,and in Cambridge, Massachusetts,and create a global classroom.,That's what I would love to do. 
 (Applause) 
 CA: So, I would imagine,that there are a lot of people who would love to join you in that endeavor.,Michael Sandel. Thank you so much. (MS: Thanks so much.)Let's pretend right here we have a machine.,A big machine, a cool, TED-ish machine,,and it's a time machine.,And everyone in this room has to get into it.,And you can go backwards, you can go forwards;,you cannot stay where you are.,And I wonder what you'd choose, because I've been asking my friends,this question a lot lately and they all want to go back.,I don't know. They want to go back before there were automobiles,or Twitter or "American Idol.",I don't know.,I'm convinced that there's some sort of pull,to nostalgia, to wishful thinking.,And I understand that. 
 I'm not part of that crowd, I have to say.,I don't want to go back, and it's not because I'm adventurous.,It's because possibilities on this planet,,they don't go back, they go forward.,So I want to get in the machine, and I want to go forward.,This is the greatest time there's ever been on this planet,by any measure that you wish to choose:,health, wealth,,mobility, opportunity,,declining rates of disease ...,There's never been a time like this.,My great-grandparents died, all of them,,by the time they were 60.,My grandparents pushed that number to 70.,My parents are closing in on 80.,So there better be,a nine at the beginning of my death number.,But it's not even about people like us,,because this is a bigger deal than that. 
 A kid born in New Delhi today,can expect to live as long as,the richest man in the world did 100 years ago.,Think about that, it's an incredible fact.,And why is it true?,Smallpox. Smallpox killed billions,of people on this planet.,It reshaped the demography of the globe,in a way that no war ever has.,It's gone. It's vanished.,We vanquished it. Puff.,In the rich world,,diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago,no longer exist, hardly.,Diphtheria, rubella, polio ...,does anyone even know what those things are?,Vaccines, modern medicine,,our ability to feed billions of people,,those are triumphs of the scientific method.,And to my mind, the scientific method --,trying stuff out,,seeing if it works, changing it when it doesn't --,is one of the great accomplishments of humanity. 
 So that's the good news.,Unfortunately, that's all the good news,because there are some other problems, and they've been mentioned many times.,And one of them is that,despite all our accomplishments,,a billion people go to bed hungry,in this world every day.,That number's rising, and it's rising really rapidly, and it's disgraceful.,And not only that, we've used our imagination,to thoroughly trash this globe.,Potable water, arable land,,rainforests, oil, gas:,they're going away, and they're going away soon,,and unless we innovate our way out of this mess,,we're going away too. 
 So the question is: Can we do that? And I think we can.,I think it's clear that we can make food,that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on.,I think we can power this world with energy,that doesn't also destroy it.,I really do believe that, and, no, it ain't wishful thinking.,But here's the thing that keeps me up at night --,one of the things that keeps me up at night:,We've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now. Never.,And we've also never been in a position,to deploy it properly in the way that we can today.,We're on the verge of amazing, amazing events,in many fields,,and yet I actually think we'd have to go back,hundreds, 300 years, before the Enlightenment,,to find a time when we battled progress,,when we fought about these things,more vigorously, on more fronts, than we do now. 
 People wrap themselves in their beliefs,,and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free.,Not even the truth will set them free.,And, listen, everyone's entitled to their opinion;,they're even entitled to their opinion about progress.,But you know what you're not entitled to?,You're not entitled to your own facts. Sorry, you're not.,And this took me awhile to figure out. 
 About a decade ago, I wrote a story about vaccines,for The New Yorker. A little story.,And I was amazed to find opposition:,opposition to what is, after all,,the most effective public health measure in human history.,I didn't know what to do,,so I just did what I do: I wrote a story and I moved on.,And soon after that,,I wrote a story about genetically engineered food.,Same thing, only bigger.,People were going crazy.,So I wrote a story about that too,,and I couldn't understand why,people thought this was "Frankenfoods,",why they thought moving molecules around,in a specific, rather than a haphazard way,,was trespassing on nature's ground.,But, you know, I do what I do. I wrote the story, I moved on.,I mean, I'm a journalist.,We type, we file, we go to dinner. It's fine. 
 (Laughter) 
 But these stories bothered me,,and I couldn't figure out why, and eventually I did.,And that's because those fanatics that were driving me crazy,weren't actually fanatics at all.,They were thoughtful people, educated people, decent people.,They were exactly like the people in this room.,And it just disturbed me so much.,But then I thought, you know, let's be honest.,We're at a point in this world,where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to.,We talk about it ambivalently.,We talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it:,"progress.",Okay, there are reasons for that, and I think we know what those reasons are.,We've lost faith in institutions,,in authority,,and sometimes in science itself,,and there's no reason we shouldn't have.,You can just say a few names,and people will understand.,Chernobyl, Bhopal, the Challenger,,Vioxx, weapons of mass destruction,,hanging chads.,You know, you can choose your list.,There are questions and problems,with the people we used to believe were always right,,so be skeptical.,Ask questions, demand proof, demand evidence.,Don't take anything for granted.,But here's the thing: When you get proof,,you need to accept the proof, and we're not that good at doing that.,And the reason that I can say that is because,we're now in an epidemic of fear,like one I've never seen and hope never to see again. 
 About 12 years ago, there was a story published,,a horrible story,,that linked the epidemic of autism,to the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine shot.,Very scary.,Tons of studies were done to see if this was true.,Tons of studies should have been done; it's a serious issue.,The data came back.,The data came back from the United States, from England,,from Sweden, from Canada,,and it was all the same: no correlation,,no connection, none at all.,It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter,because we believe anecdotes,,we believe what we see, what we think we see,,what makes us feel real.,We don't believe a bunch of documents,from a government official giving us data,,and I do understand that, I think we all do.,But you know what?,The result of that has been disastrous.,Disastrous because here's a fact:,The United States is one of the only countries in the world,where the vaccine rate for measles is going down.,That is disgraceful,,and we should be ashamed of ourselves.,It's horrible.,What kind of a thing happened,that we could do that? 
 Now, I understand it. I do understand it.,Because, did anyone have measles here?,Has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of measles?,Doesn't happen very much.,Doesn't happen in this country at all,,but it happened 160,000 times in the world last year.,That's a lot of death of measles --,20 an hour.,But since it didn't happen here, we can put it out of our minds,,and people like Jenny McCarthy,can go around preaching messages,of fear and illiteracy from platforms,like "Oprah" and "Larry King Live.",And they can do it because,they don't link causation and correlation.,They don't understand that these things seem the same,,but they're almost never the same.,And it's something we need to learn, and we need to learn it really soon. 
 This guy was a hero, Jonas Salk.,He took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us.,No fear, no agony. Polio -- puff, gone.,That guy in the middle, not so much.,His name is Paul Offit.,He just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other people.,It'll save the lives of 400 to 500,000 kids,in the developing world every year.,Pretty good, right?,Well, it's good, except that Paul goes around talking about vaccines,and says how valuable they are,and that people ought to just stop the whining.,And he actually says it that way.,So, Paul's a terrorist.,When Paul speaks in a public hearing,,he can't testify without armed guards.,He gets called at home,because people like to tell him,that they remember where his kids go to school.,And why? Because Paul made a vaccine. 
 I don't need to say this, but vaccines are essential.,You take them away, disease comes back,,horrible diseases. And that's happening.,We have measles in this country now.,And it's getting worse, and pretty soon kids,are going to die of it again because it's just a numbers game.,And they're not just going to die of measles.,What about polio? Let's have that. Why not?,A college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said,she thought I was a little strident.,No one's ever said that before.,She wasn't going to vaccinate her kid against polio,,no way.,Fine.,Why? Because we don't have polio. And you know what?,We didn't have polio in this country yesterday.,Today, I don't know, maybe a guy got on a plane in Lagos this morning,,and he's flying to LAX, right now he's over Ohio.,And he's going to land in a couple of hours, he's going to rent a car,,and he's going to come to Long Beach,,and he's going to attend one of these fabulous TED dinners tonight.,And he doesn't know that he's infected with a paralytic disease,,and we don't either because that's the way the world works.,That's the planet we live on. Don't pretend it isn't. 
 Now, we love to wrap ourselves in lies. We love to do it.,Everyone take their vitamins this morning?,Echinacea, a little antioxidant,to get you going.,I know you did because half of Americans do every day.,They take the stuff, and they take alternative medicines,,and it doesn't matter how often,we find out that they're useless.,The data says it all the time.,They darken your urine. They almost never do more than that.,(Laughter),It's okay, you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine?,I'm totally with you.,(Laughter),Dark urine. Dark.,Why do we do that? Why do we do that?,Well, I think I understand, we hate Big Pharma.,We hate Big Government. We don't trust the Man.,And we shouldn't: Our health care system sucks.,It's cruel to millions of people.,It's absolutely astonishingly cold,and soul-bending to those of us who can even afford it.,So we run away from it, and where do we run?,We leap into the arms of Big Placebo.,(Laughter),That's fantastic. I love Big Placebo.,(Applause) 
 But, you know, it's really a serious thing,because this stuff is crap,,and we spend billions of dollars on it.,And I have all sorts of little props here.,None of it ... ginkgo, fraud;,echinacea, fraud;,acai -- I don't even know what that is,but we're spending billions of dollars on it -- it's fraud.,And you know what? When I say this stuff, people scream at me,,and they say, "What do you care? Let people do what they want to do.,It makes them feel good.",And you know what? You're wrong.,Because I don't care,if it's the secretary of HHS,who's saying, "Hmm, I'm not going to take the evidence,of my experts on mammograms,",or some cancer quack who wants to treat his patient,with coffee enemas.,When you start down the road,where belief and magic replace evidence and science,,you end up in a place you don't want to be.,You end up in Thabo Mbeki South Africa.,He killed 400,000 of his people,by insisting that beetroot,,garlic and lemon oil,were much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs,we know can slow the course of AIDS.,Hundreds of thousands of needless deaths,in a country that has been plagued,worse than any other by this disease.,Please, don't tell me,there are no consequences to these things.,There are. There always are. 
 Now, the most mindless epidemic,we're in the middle of right now,is this absurd battle,between proponents of genetically engineered food,and the organic elite.,It's an idiotic debate. It has to stop.,It's a debate about words, about metaphors.,It's ideology, it's not science.,Every single thing we eat, every grain of rice,,every sprig of parsley,,every Brussels sprout,has been modified by man.,You know, there weren't tangerines in the garden of Eden.,There wasn't any cantaloupe. (Laughter),There weren't Christmas trees. We made it all.,We made it over the last 11,000 years.,And some of it worked, and some of it didn't.,We got rid of the stuff that didn't.,Now we can do it in a more precise way --,and there are risks, absolutely --,but we can put something like vitamin A into rice,,and that stuff can help millions of people,,millions of people, prolong their lives.,You don't want to do that?,I have to say, I don't understand it. 
 We object to genetically engineered food.,Why do we do that?,Well, the things I constantly hear are:,Too many chemicals,,pesticides, hormones,,monoculture, we don't want giant fields,of the same thing, that's wrong.,We don't companies patenting life.,We don't want companies owning seeds.,And you know what my response to all of that is?,Yes, you're right. Let's fix it.,It's true, we've got a huge food problem,,but this isn't science.,This has nothing to do with science.,It's law, it's morality, it's patent stuff.,You know science isn't a company.,It's not a country.,It's not even an idea; it's a process.,It's a process, and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't,,but the idea that we should not allow,science to do its job,because we're afraid,,is really very deadening,,and it's preventing millions of people,from prospering. 
 You know, in the next 50 years,we're going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we do right now,,70 percent.,This investment in Africa over the last 30 years.,Disgraceful. Disgraceful.,They need it, and we're not giving it to them.,And why? Genetically engineered food.,We don't want to encourage people,to eat that rotten stuff, like cassava for instance.,Cassava's something that half a billion people eat.,It's kind of like a potato.,It's just a bunch of calories. It sucks.,It doesn't have nutrients, it doesn't have protein,,and scientists are engineering,all of that into it right now.,And then people would be able to eat it and they'd be able to not go blind.,They wouldn't starve, and you know what?,That would be nice. It wouldn't be Chez Panisse,,but it would be nice. 
 And all I can say about this is:,Why are we fighting it?,I mean, let's ask ourselves: Why are we fighting it?,Because we don't want to move genes around?,This is about moving genes around. It's not about chemicals.,It's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones,,our insistence on having bigger food,,better food, singular food.,This isn't about Rice Krispies,,this is about keeping people alive,,and it's about time we started to understand what that meant.,Because, you know something?,If we don't, if we continue to act the way we're acting,,we're guilty of something that I don't think we want to be guilty of:,high-tech colonialism.,There's no other way to describe what's going on here.,It's selfish, it's ugly,,it's beneath us,,and we really have to stop it. 
 So after this amazingly fun conversation,,(Laughter),you might want to say, "So, you still want to get in this,ridiculous time machine and go forward?",Absolutely. Absolutely, I do.,It's stuck in the present right now,,but we have an amazing opportunity.,We can set that time machine on anything we want.,We can move it where we want to move it,,and we're going to move it where we want to move it.,We have to have these conversations and we have to think,,but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead,,we're going to be happy we do.,I know that we can,,and as far as I'm concerned,,that's something the world needs right now. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. 
 Thank you. Thank you.Trees epitomize stasis.,Trees are rooted in the ground in one place,for many human generations,,but if we shift our perspective,from the trunk to the twigs,,trees become very dynamic entities,,moving and growing.,And I decided to explore this movement,by turning trees into artists.,I simply tied the end of a paintbrush onto a twig.,I waited for the wind to come up and held up a canvas,,and that produced art.,The piece of art you see on your left,is painted by a western red cedar,and that on your right by a Douglas fir,,and what I learned was that different species,have different signatures, like a Picasso versus a Monet. 
 But I was also interested in the movement of trees,and how this art might let me capture that and quantify it,,so to measure the distance that a single vine maple tree --,which produced this painting -- moved in a single year,,I simply measured and summed,each of those lines.,I multiplied them by the number of twigs per branch,and the number of branches per tree,and then divided that by the number of minutes per year.,And so I was able to calculate,how far a single tree moved in a single year.,You might have a guess.,The answer is actually 186,540 miles,,or seven times around the globe.,And so simply by shifting our perspective from a single trunk,to the many dynamic twigs,,we are able to see that trees are not simply static entities,,but rather extremely dynamic. 
 And I began to think about ways that,we might consider this lesson of trees,,to consider other entities that are also static and stuck,,but which cry for change and dynamicism,,and one of those entities is our prisons.,Prisons, of course, are where people who break our laws,are stuck, confined behind bars.,And our prison system itself is stuck.,The United States has over 2.3 million,incarcerated men and women.,That number is rising.,Of the 100 incarcerated people that are released,,60 will return to prison.,Funds for education, for training,and for rehabilitation are declining,,so this despairing cycle of incarceration continues.,I decided to ask whether the lesson,I had learned from trees as artists,could be applied to a static institution,such as our prisons,,and I think the answer is yes. 
 In the year 2007,,I started a partnership,with the Washington State Department of Corrections.,Working with four prisons, we began bringing science and scientists,,sustainability and conservation projects,to four state prisons.,We give science lectures,,and the men here are choosing to come to our science lectures,instead of watching television or weightlifting.,That, I think, is movement.,We partnered with the Nature Conservancy,for inmates at Stafford Creek Correctional Center,to grow endangered prairie plants,for restoration of relic prairie areas in Washington state.,That, I think, is movement.,We worked with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife,to grow endangered frogs -- the Oregon spotted frog --,for later release into protected wetlands.,That, I think, is movement. 
 And just recently, we've begun to work with,those men who are segregated,in what we call Supermax facilities.,They've incurred violent infractions,by becoming violent with guards,and with other prisoners.,They're kept in bare cells like this,for 23 hours a day.,When they have meetings with their review boards or mental health professionals,,they're placed in immobile booths like this.,For one hour a day,they're brought to these bleak and bland exercise yards.,Although we can't bring trees and prairie plants,and frogs into these environments,,we are bringing images of nature,into these exercise yards,,putting them on the walls, so at least they get contact,with visual images of nature.,This is Mr. Lopez, who has been in solitary confinement for 18 months,,and he's providing input on the types of images,that he believes would make him and his fellow inmates,more serene, more calm,,less apt to violence. 
 And so what we see, I think,,is that small, collective movements of change,can perhaps move,an entity such as our own prison system,in a direction of hope.,We know that trees are static entities,when we look at their trunks.,But if trees can create art,,if they can encircle the globe seven times in one year,,if prisoners can grow plants and raise frogs,,then perhaps there are other static entities,that we hold inside ourselves,,like grief, like addictions,,like racism,,that can also change. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I'm going to speak today about the relationship,between science and human values.,Now, it's generally understood that,questions of morality --,questions of good and evil and right and wrong --,are questions about which science officially has no opinion.,It's thought that science can help us,get what we value,,but it can never tell us what we ought to value.,And, consequently, most people -- I think most people,probably here -- think that science will never answer,the most important questions in human life:,questions like, "What is worth living for?","What is worth dying for?","What constitutes a good life?" 
 So, I'm going to argue,that this is an illusion -- that the separation between,science and human values is an illusion --,and actually quite a dangerous one,at this point in human history.,Now, it's often said that science,cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values,,because science deals with facts,,and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres.,It's often thought that there's no description,of the way the world is,that can tell us how the world ought to be.,But I think this is quite clearly untrue.,Values are a certain kind of fact.,They are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures. 
 Why is it that we don't have ethical obligations toward rocks?,Why don't we feel compassion for rocks?,It's because we don't think rocks can suffer. And if we're more,concerned about our fellow primates,than we are about insects, as indeed we are,,it's because we think they're exposed to a greater range,of potential happiness and suffering.,Now, the crucial thing to notice here,is that this is a factual claim:,This is something that we could be right or wrong about. And if we,have misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity,and the possibilities of experience,well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects. 
 And there's no notion,,no version of human morality,and human values that I've ever come across,that is not at some point reducible,to a concern about conscious experience,and its possible changes.,Even if you get your values from religion,,even if you think that good and evil ultimately,relate to conditions after death --,either to an eternity of happiness with God,or an eternity of suffering in hell --,you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes.,And to say that such changes can persist after death,is itself a factual claim,,which, of course, may or may not be true. 
 Now, to speak about the conditions of well-being,in this life, for human beings,,we know that there is a continuum of such facts.,We know that it's possible to live in a failed state,,where everything that can go wrong does go wrong --,where mothers cannot feed their children,,where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration,,where people are murdered indiscriminately.,And we know that it's possible to move along this continuum,towards something quite a bit more idyllic,,to a place where a conference like this is even conceivable. 
 And we know -- we know --,that there are right and wrong answers,to how to move in this space.,Would adding cholera to the water be a good idea?,Probably not.,Would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye,,so that when bad things happened to them,they immediately blame their neighbors? Probably not.,There are truths to be known,about how human communities flourish,,whether or not we understand these truths.,And morality relates to these truths. 
 So, in talking about values we are talking about facts.,Now, of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels --,from the level of the genome,on up to the level of economic systems,and political arrangements.,But if we're going to talk about human well-being,we are, of necessity, talking about the human brain.,Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it,is realized in the brain -- 
 whatever happens after death.,Even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife,,in this life, his personality --,his rather unfortunate personality --,is the product of his brain.,So the contributions of culture --,if culture changes us, as indeed it does,,it changes us by changing our brains.,And so therefore whatever cultural variation there is,in how human beings flourish,can, at least in principle, be understood,in the context of a maturing science of the mind --,neuroscience, psychology, etc. 
 So, what I'm arguing is that,value's reduced to facts --,to facts about the conscious experience,of conscious beings.,And we can therefore visualize a space,of possible changes in the experience of these beings.,And I think of this as kind of a moral landscape,,with peaks and valleys that correspond,to differences in the well-being of conscious creatures,,both personal and collective.,And one thing to notice is that perhaps,there are states of human well-being,that we rarely access, that few people access.,And these await our discovery.,Perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called,mystical or spiritual.,Perhaps there are other states that we can't access,because of how our minds are structured,but other minds possibly could access them. 
 Now, let me be clear about what I'm not saying. I'm not saying,that science is guaranteed to map this space,,or that we will have scientific answers to every,conceivable moral question.,I don't think, for instance, that you will one day consult,a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child,,or whether we should bomb Iran's nuclear facilities,,or whether you can deduct the full cost of TED as a business expense.,(Laughter),But if questions affect human well-being,then they do have answers, whether or not we can find them.,And just admitting this --,just admitting that there are right and wrong answers,to the question of how humans flourish --,will change the way we talk about morality,,and will change our expectations,of human cooperation in the future. 
 For instance, there are 21 states in our country,where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal,,where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board, hard,,and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin.,And hundreds of thousands of children, incidentally,,are subjected to this every year.,The locations of these enlightened districts, I think, will fail to surprise you.,We're not talking about Connecticut. 
 And the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious.,The creator of the universe himself,has told us not to spare the rod,,lest we spoil the child --,this is in Proverbs 13 and 20, and I believe, 23.,But we can ask the obvious question:,Is it a good idea, generally speaking,,to subject children to pain,and violence and public humiliation,as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development,and good behavior?,(Laughter),Is there any doubt,that this question has an answer,,and that it matters? 
 Now, many of you might worry,that the notion of well-being is truly undefined,,and seemingly perpetually open to be re-construed.,And so, how therefore can there be an,objective notion of well-being?,Well, consider by analogy, the concept of physical health.,The concept of physical health is undefined.,As we just heard from Michael Specter, it has changed over the years.,When this statue was carved,the average life expectancy was probably 30.,It's now around 80 in the developed world.,There may come a time when we meddle with our genomes,in such a way that not being able to run a marathon,at age 200 will be considered a profound disability.,People will send you donations when you're in that condition.,(Laughter) 
 Notice that the fact that the concept of health,is open, genuinely open for revision,,does not make it vacuous.,The distinction between a healthy person,and a dead one,is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science.,Another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape:,There may be equivalent ways to thrive;,there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society,so as to maximize human flourishing. 
 Now, why wouldn't this,undermine an objective morality?,Well think of how we talk about food:,I would never be tempted to argue to you,that there must be one right food to eat.,There is clearly a range of materials,that constitute healthy food.,But there's nevertheless a clear distinction,between food and poison.,The fact that there are many right answers,to the question, "What is food?",does not tempt us,to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition.,Many people worry,that a universal morality would require,moral precepts that admit of no exceptions. 
 So, for instance, if it's really wrong to lie,,it must always be wrong to lie,,and if you can find an exception,,well then there's no such thing as moral truth.,Why would we think this?,Consider, by analogy, the game of chess.,Now, if you're going to play good chess,,a principle like, "Don't lose your Queen,",is very good to follow.,But it clearly admits some exceptions.,There are moments when losing your Queen is a brilliant thing to do.,There are moments when it is the only good thing you can do.,And yet, chess is a domain of perfect objectivity.,The fact that there are exceptions here does not,change that at all. 
 Now, this brings us to the sorts of moves,that people are apt to make in the moral sphere.,Consider the great problem of women's bodies:,What to do about them?,Well this is one thing you can do about them:,You can cover them up.,Now, it is the position, generally speaking, of our intellectual community,that while we may not like this,,we might think of this as "wrong",in Boston or Palo Alto,,who are we to say,that the proud denizens of an ancient culture,are wrong to force their wives and daughters,to live in cloth bags?,And who are we to say, even, that they're wrong,to beat them with lengths of steel cable,,or throw battery acid in their faces,if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way? 
 Well, who are we not to say this?,Who are we to pretend,that we know so little about human well-being,that we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this?,I'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil --,women should be able to wear whatever they want, as far as I'm concerned.,But what does voluntary mean,in a community where,,when a girl gets raped,,her father's first impulse,,rather often, is to murder her out of shame? 
 Just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute:,Your daughter gets raped,,and what you want to do is kill her.,What are the chances that represents,a peak of human flourishing? 
 Now, to say this is not to say that we have got the,perfect solution in our own society.,For instance,,this is what it's like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere,in the civilized world.,Now, granted, for many men,it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images.,(Laughter),But if we are in a reflective mood,,we can ask,,"Is this the perfect expression,of psychological balance,with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women's bodies?",I mean, is this the optimal environment,in which to raise our children?,Probably not. OK, so perhaps there's some place,on the spectrum,between these two extremes,that represents a place of better balance.,(Applause),Perhaps there are many such places -- 
 again, given other changes in human culture,there may be many peaks on the moral landscape.,But the thing to notice is that there will be,many more ways not to be on a peak.,Now the irony, from my perspective,,is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me,and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions,are religious demagogues of one form or another. 
 And of course they think they have right answers to moral questions,because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind,,not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes,and condition of human and animal well-being.,In fact, the endurance of religion,as a lens through which most people view moral questions,has separated most moral talk,from real questions of human and animal suffering.,This is why we spend our time,talking about things like gay marriage,and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation,or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue.,But the demagogues are right about one thing: We need,a universal conception of human values. 
 Now, what stands in the way of this?,Well, one thing to notice is that we,do something different when talking about morality --,especially secular, academic, scientist types.,When talking about morality we value differences of opinion,in a way that we don't in any other area of our lives.,So, for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning,meditating on compassion,,and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component,of human happiness.,On the other hand, we have someone like Ted Bundy;,Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping,and torturing and killing young women. 
 So, we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion,about how to profitably use one's time.,(Laughter),Most Western intellectuals,look at this situation,and say, "Well, there's nothing for the Dalai Lama,to be really right about -- really right about --,or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about,that admits of a real argument,that potentially falls within the purview of science.,He likes chocolate, he likes vanilla.,There's nothing that one should be able to say to the other,that should persuade the other.",Notice that we don't do this in science. 
 On the left you have Edward Witten.,He's a string theorist.,If you ask the smartest physicists around,who is the smartest physicist around,,in my experience half of them will say Ed Witten.,The other half will tell you they don't like the question.,(Laughter),So, what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference,and said,"String theory is bogus.,It doesn't resonate with me. It's not how I chose to,view the universe at a small scale.,I'm not a fan.",(Laughter),Well, nothing would happen because I'm not a physicist;,I don't understand string theory.,I'm the Ted Bundy of string theory.,(Laughter),I wouldn't want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member. 
 But this is just the point.,Whenever we are talking about facts,certain opinions must be excluded.,That is what it is to have a domain of expertise.,That is what it is for knowledge to count.,How have we convinced ourselves,that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise,,or moral talent, or moral genius even?,How have we convinced ourselves,that every opinion has to count?,How have we convinced ourselves,that every culture has a point of view,on these subjects worth considering?,Does the Taliban,have a point of view on physics,that is worth considering? No.,(Laughter),How is their ignorance any less obvious,on the subject of human well-being?,(Applause) 
 So, this, I think, is what the world needs now.,It needs people like ourselves to admit,that there are right and wrong answers,to questions of human flourishing,,and morality relates,to that domain of facts.,It is possible,for individuals, and even for whole cultures,,to care about the wrong things,,which is to say that it's possible for them,to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead,to needless human suffering.,Just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality.,We live in a world in which,the boundaries between nations mean less and less,,and they will one day mean nothing. 
 We live in a world filled with destructive technology,,and this technology cannot be uninvented;,it will always be easier,to break things than to fix them.,It seems to me, therefore, patently obvious,that we can no more,respect and tolerate,vast differences in notions of human well-being,than we can respect or tolerate vast differences,in the notions about how disease spreads,,or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes.,We simply must converge,on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life.,And to do that, we have to admit that these questions have answers.,Thank you very much.,(Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: So, some combustible material there.,Whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world,,hearing some of this, may well be doing the,screaming-with-rage thing, after as well, some of them. 
 Language seems to be really important here.,When you're talking about the veil,,you're talking about women dressed in cloth bags.,I've lived in the Muslim world, spoken with a lot of Muslim women.,And some of them would say something else. They would say,,"No, you know, this is a celebration,of female specialness,,it helps build that and it's a result of the fact that" --,and this is arguably a sophisticated psychological view --,"that male lust is not to be trusted.",I mean, can you engage in a conversation,with that kind of woman without seeming kind of cultural imperialist? 
 Sam Harris: Yeah, well I think I tried to broach this in a sentence,,watching the clock ticking,,but the question is:,What is voluntary in a context,where men have certain expectations,,and you're guaranteed to be treated in a certain way,if you don't veil yourself?,And so, if anyone in this room,wanted to wear a veil,,or a very funny hat, or tattoo their face --,I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want,,but we have to be honest about,the constraints that these women are placed under.,And so I think we shouldn't be so eager,to always take their word for it,,especially when it's 120 degrees out,and you're wearing a full burqa. 
 CA: A lot of people want to believe in this,concept of moral progress.,But can you reconcile that?,I think I understood you to say that you could,reconcile that with a world that doesn't become,one dimensional, where we all have to think the same.,Paint your picture of what,rolling the clock 50 years forward,,100 years forward, how you would like to think of,the world, balancing moral progress,with richness. 
 SH: Well, I think once you admit,that we are on the path toward understanding our minds,at the level of the brain in some important detail,,then you have to admit,that we are going to understand all of the positive,and negative qualities,of ourselves in much greater detail.,So, we're going to understand positive social emotion,like empathy and compassion,,and we're going to understand the factors,that encourage it -- whether they're genetic,,whether they're how people talk to one another,,whether they're economic systems,,and insofar as we begin to shine light on that,we are inevitably going to converge,on that fact space. 
 So, everything is not going to be up for grabs.,It's not going to be like,veiling my daughter from birth,is just as good as teaching her,to be confident and well-educated,in the context of men who do desire women.,I mean I don't think we need an NSF grant to know,that compulsory veiling is a bad idea --,but at a certain point,we're going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved,and actually interrogate them.,Do people love their daughters,just as much in these systems?,And I think there are clearly right answers to that. 
 CA: And if the results come out that actually they do,,are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment,on some of these issues? 
 SH: Well yeah, modulo one obvious fact,,that you can love someone,in the context of a truly delusional belief system.,So, you can say like, "Because I knew my gay son,was going to go to hell if he found a boyfriend,,I chopped his head off. And that was the most compassionate thing I could do.",If you get all those parts aligned,,yes I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love.,But again, then we have to talk about,well-being in a larger context.,It's all of us in this together,,not one man feeling ecstasy,and then blowing himself up on a bus. 
 CA: Sam, this is a conversation I would actually love to,continue for hours.,We don't have that, but maybe another time. Thank you for coming to TED. 
 SH: Really an honor. Thank you.,(Applause)So let me just start with my story.,So I tore my knee joint meniscus cartilage,playing soccer in college.,Then I went on to tear my ACL, the ligament in my knee,,and then developed an arthritic knee.,And I'm sure that many of you in this audience have that same story,,and, by the way, I married a woman,who has exactly the same story.,So this motivated me to become an orthopedic surgeon,and to see if I couldn't focus on solutions for those problems,that would keep me playing sports and not limit me.,So with that, let me just show you a quick video,to get you in the mood of what we're trying to explain. 
 Narrator: We are all aware of the risk of cancer,,but there's another disease,that's destined to affect even more of us: arthritis.,Cancer may kill you, but when you look at the numbers,,arthritis ruins more lives.,Assuming you live a long life, there's a 50 percent chance,you'll develop arthritis.,And it's not just aging that causes arthritis.,Common injuries can lead to decades of pain,,until our joints quite literally grind to a halt.,Desperate for a solution, we've turned to engineering,to design artificial components,to replace our worn-out body parts,,but in the midst of the modern buzz,around the promises of a bionic body,,shouldn't we stop and ask if there's a better, more natural way?,Let's consider an alternative path.,What if all the replacements our bodies need,already exist in nature,,or within our own stem cells?,This is the field of biologic replacements,,where we replace worn-out parts with new, natural ones. 
 Kevin Stone: And so, the mission is:,how do I treat these things biologically?,And let's talk about both what I did for my wife,,and what I've done for hundreds of other patients.,First thing for my wife,,and the most common thing I hear from my patients,,particularly in the 40- to 80-year-old age group, 70-year-old age group,,is they come in and say,,"Hey, Doc, isn't there just a shock absorber you can put in my knee?,I'm not ready for joint replacement.",And so for her, I put in a human meniscus allograft donor,right into that [knee] joint space.,And [the allograft] replaces [the missing meniscus].,And then for that unstable ligament,,we put in a human donor ligament,to stabilize the knee.,And then for the damaged arthritis on the surface,,we did a stem cell paste graft,,which we designed in 1991,,to regrow that articular cartilage surface,and give it back a smooth surface there.,So here's my wife's bad knee on the left,,and her just hiking now,four months later in Aspen, and doing well.,And it works, not just for my wife, but certainly for other patients.,The girl on the video, Jen Hudak,,just won the Superpipe in Aspen,just nine months after having destroyed her knee,,as you see in the other image --,and having a paste graft to that knee.,And so we can regrow these surfaces biologically. 
 So with all this success,,why isn't that good enough, you might ask.,Well the reason is because there's not enough donor cycles.,There's not enough young, healthy people,falling off their motorcycle,and donating that tissue to us.,And the tissue's very expensive.,And so that's not going to be a solution,that's going to get us global with biologic tissue.,But the solution is animal tissue,because it's plentiful, it's cheap,,you can get it from young, healthy tissues,,but the barrier is immunology.,And the specific barrier,is a specific epitope,called the galactosyl, or gal epitope.,So if we're going to transplant animal tissues to people,,we have to figure out a way to get rid of that epitope. 
 So my story in working with animal tissues,starts in 1984.,And I started first,with cow Achilles tendon,,where we would take the cow Achilles tendon,,which is type-I collagen,,strip it of its antigens,by degrading it with an acid and detergent wash,and forming it into a regeneration template.,We would then take that regeneration template,and insert it into the missing meniscus cartilage,to regrow that in a patient's knee.,We've now done that procedure,,and it's been done worldwide in over 4,000 cases,,so it's an FDA-approved and worldwide-accepted way,to regrow the meniscus.,And that's great when I can degrade the tissue.,But what happens for your ligament when I need an intact ligament?,I can't grind it up in a blender.,So in that case,,I have to design -- and we designed with Uri Galili and Tom Turek --,an enzyme wash,to wash away, or strip,,those galactosyl epitopes,with a specific enzyme.,And we call that a "gal stripping" technique.,What we do is humanize the tissue.,It's by gal stripping that tissue,we humanize it (Laughter),,and then we can put it back,into a patient's knee.,And we've done that. Now we've taken pig ligament --,young, healthy, big tissue,,put it into 10 patients in an FDA-approved trial --,and then one of our patients went on to have,three Canadian Masters Downhill championships --,on his "pig-lig," as he calls it. So we know it can work.,And there's a wide clinical trial of this tissue now pending. 
 So what about the next step?,What about getting to a total biologic knee replacement,,not just the parts?,How are we going to revolutionize artificial joint replacement?,Well here's how we're going to do it.,So what we're going to do is take,an articular cartilage,from a young, healthy pig,,strip it of its antigens,,load it with your stem cells,,then put it back on to that,arthritic surface in your knee,,tack it on there, have you heal that surface,and then create a new biologic surface for your knee.,So that's our biologic approach right now.,We're going to rebuild your knee with the parts.,We're going to resurface it with a completely new surface. 
 But we have other advantages from the animal kingdom.,There's a benefit of 400 million years,of ambulation.,We can harness those benefits.,We can use thicker, younger, better tissues,than you might have injured in your knee,,or that you might have when you're 40, 50 or 60.,We can do it as an outpatient procedure.,We can strip that tissue very economically,,and so this is how we can get biologic knee replacement,to go global. 
 And so welcome to super biologics.,It's not hardware.,It's not software.,It's bioware.,It's version 2.0 of you.,And so with that, coming to a --,(Laughter),coming to an operating theater near you soon, I believe. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Thank you very much.,Please excuse me for sitting; I'm very old.,(Laughter),Well, the topic I'm going to discuss,is one which is, in a certain sense, very peculiar,because it's very old.,Roughness is part of human life,forever and forever,,and ancient authors have written about it.,It was very much uncontrollable,,and in a certain sense,,it seemed to be the extreme of complexity,,just a mess, a mess and a mess.,There are many different kinds of mess.,Now, in fact,,by a complete fluke,,I got involved many years ago,in a study of this form of complexity,,and to my utter amazement,,I found traces --,very strong traces, I must say --,of order in that roughness.,And so today, I would like to present to you,a few examples,of what this represents.,I prefer the word roughness,to the word irregularity,because irregularity --,to someone who had Latin,in my long-past youth --,means the contrary of regularity.,But it is not so.,Regularity is the contrary of roughness,because the basic aspect of the world,is very rough. 
 So let me show you a few objects.,Some of them are artificial.,Others of them are very real, in a certain sense.,Now this is the real. It's a cauliflower.,Now why do I show a cauliflower,,a very ordinary and ancient vegetable?,Because old and ancient as it may be,,it's very complicated and it's very simple,,both at the same time.,If you try to weigh it -- of course it's very easy to weigh it,,and when you eat it, the weight matters --,but suppose you try to,measure its surface.,Well, it's very interesting.,If you cut, with a sharp knife,,one of the florets of a cauliflower,and look at it separately,,you think of a whole cauliflower, but smaller.,And then you cut again,,again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again,,and you still get small cauliflowers.,So the experience of humanity,has always been that there are some shapes,which have this peculiar property,,that each part is like the whole,,but smaller.,Now, what did humanity do with that?,Very, very little.,(Laughter) 
 So what I did actually is to,study this problem,,and I found something quite surprising.,That one can measure roughness,by a number, a number,,2.3, 1.2 and sometimes much more.,One day, a friend of mine,,to bug me,,brought a picture and said,,"What is the roughness of this curve?",I said, "Well, just short of 1.5.",It was 1.48.,Now, it didn't take me any time.,I've been looking at these things for so long.,So these numbers are the numbers,which denote the roughness of these surfaces.,I hasten to say that these surfaces,are completely artificial.,They were done on a computer,,and the only input is a number,,and that number is roughness.,So on the left,,I took the roughness copied from many landscapes.,To the right, I took a higher roughness.,So the eye, after a while,,can distinguish these two very well. 
 Humanity had to learn about measuring roughness.,This is very rough, and this is sort of smooth, and this perfectly smooth.,Very few things are very smooth.,So then if you try to ask questions:,"What's the surface of a cauliflower?",Well, you measure and measure and measure.,Each time you're closer, it gets bigger,,down to very, very small distances.,What's the length of the coastline,of these lakes?,The closer you measure, the longer it is.,The concept of length of coastline,,which seems to be so natural,because it's given in many cases,,is, in fact, complete fallacy; there's no such thing.,You must do it differently. 
 What good is that, to know these things?,Well, surprisingly enough,,it's good in many ways.,To begin with, artificial landscapes,,which I invented sort of,,are used in cinema all the time.,We see mountains in the distance.,They may be mountains, but they may be just formulae, just cranked on.,Now it's very easy to do.,It used to be very time-consuming, but now it's nothing.,Now look at that. That's a real lung.,Now a lung is something very strange.,If you take this thing,,you know very well it weighs very little.,The volume of a lung is very small,,but what about the area of the lung?,Anatomists were arguing very much about that.,Some say that a normal male's lung,has an area of the inside,of a basketball [court].,And the others say, no, five basketball [courts].,Enormous disagreements.,Why so? Because, in fact, the area of the lung,is something very ill-defined.,The bronchi branch, branch, branch,and they stop branching,,not because of any matter of principle,,but because of physical considerations:,the mucus, which is in the lung.,So what happens is that in a way,you have a much bigger lung,,but it branches and branches,down to distances about the same for a whale, for a man,and for a little rodent. 
 Now, what good is it to have that?,Well, surprisingly enough, amazingly enough,,the anatomists had a very poor idea,of the structure of the lung until very recently.,And I think that my mathematics,,surprisingly enough,,has been of great help,to the surgeons,studying lung illnesses,and also kidney illnesses,,all these branching systems,,for which there was no geometry.,So I found myself, in other words,,constructing a geometry,,a geometry of things which had no geometry.,And a surprising aspect of it,is that very often, the rules of this geometry,are extremely short.,You have formulas that long.,And you crank it several times.,Sometimes repeatedly: again, again, again,,the same repetition.,And at the end, you get things like that. 
 This cloud is completely,,100 percent artificial.,Well, 99.9.,And the only part which is natural,is a number, the roughness of the cloud,,which is taken from nature.,Something so complicated like a cloud,,so unstable, so varying,,should have a simple rule behind it.,Now this simple rule,is not an explanation of clouds.,The seer of clouds had to,take account of it.,I don't know how much advanced,these pictures are. They're old.,I was very much involved in it,,but then turned my attention to other phenomena. 
 Now, here is another thing,which is rather interesting.,One of the shattering events,in the history of mathematics,,which is not appreciated by many people,,occurred about 130 years ago,,145 years ago.,Mathematicians began to create,shapes that didn't exist.,Mathematicians got into self-praise,to an extent which was absolutely amazing,,that man can invent things,that nature did not know.,In particular, it could invent,things like a curve which fills the plane.,A curve's a curve, a plane's a plane,,and the two won't mix.,Well, they do mix.,A man named Peano,did define such curves,,and it became an object of extraordinary interest.,It was very important, but mostly interesting,because a kind of break,,a separation between,the mathematics coming from reality, on the one hand,,and new mathematics coming from pure man's mind.,Well, I was very sorry to point out,that the pure man's mind,has, in fact,,seen at long last,what had been seen for a long time.,And so here I introduce something,,the set of rivers of a plane-filling curve.,And well,,it's a story unto itself.,So it was in 1875 to 1925,,an extraordinary period,in which mathematics prepared itself to break out from the world.,And the objects which were used,as examples, when I was,a child and a student, as examples,of the break between mathematics,and visible reality --,those objects,,I turned them completely around.,I used them for describing,some of the aspects of the complexity of nature. 
 Well, a man named Hausdorff in 1919,introduced a number which was just a mathematical joke,,and I found that this number,was a good measurement of roughness.,When I first told it to my friends in mathematics,they said, "Don't be silly. It's just something [silly].",Well actually, I was not silly.,The great painter Hokusai knew it very well.,The things on the ground are algae.,He did not know the mathematics; it didn't yet exist.,And he was Japanese who had no contact with the West.,But painting for a long time had a fractal side.,I could speak of that for a long time.,The Eiffel Tower has a fractal aspect.,I read the book that Mr. Eiffel wrote about his tower,,and indeed it was astonishing how much he understood. 
 This is a mess, mess, mess, Brownian loop.,One day I decided --,halfway through my career,,I was held by so many things in my work --,I decided to test myself.,Could I just look at something,which everybody had been looking at for a long time,and find something dramatically new?,Well, so I looked at these,things called Brownian motion -- just goes around.,I played with it for a while,,and I made it return to the origin.,Then I was telling my assistant,,"I don't see anything. Can you paint it?",So he painted it, which means,he put inside everything. He said:,"Well, this thing came out ..." And I said, "Stop! Stop! Stop!,I see; it's an island.",And amazing.,So Brownian motion, which happens to have,a roughness number of two, goes around.,I measured it, 1.33.,Again, again, again.,Long measurements, big Brownian motions,,1.33.,Mathematical problem: how to prove it?,It took my friends 20 years.,Three of them were having incomplete proofs.,They got together, and together they had the proof.,So they got the big [Fields] medal in mathematics,,one of the three medals that people have received,for proving things which I've seen,without being able to prove them. 
 Now everybody asks me at one point or another,,"How did it all start?,What got you in that strange business?",What got you to be,,at the same time, a mechanical engineer,,a geographer,and a mathematician and so on, a physicist?,Well actually I started, oddly enough,,studying stock market prices.,And so here,I had this theory,,and I wrote books about it --,financial prices increments.,To the left you see data over a long period.,To the right, on top,,you see a theory which is very, very fashionable.,It was very easy, and you can write many books very fast about it.,(Laughter),There are thousands of books on that.,Now compare that with real price increments.,Where are real price increments?,Well, these other lines,include some real price increments,and some forgery which I did.,So the idea there was,that one must be able to -- how do you say? --,model price variation.,And it went really well 50 years ago.,For 50 years, people were sort of pooh-poohing me,because they could do it much, much easier.,But I tell you, at this point, people listened to me.,(Laughter),These two curves are averages:,Standard & Poor, the blue one;,and the red one is Standard & Poor's,from which the five biggest discontinuities,are taken out.,Now discontinuities are a nuisance,,so in many studies of prices,,one puts them aside.,"Well, acts of God.,And you have the little nonsense which is left.,Acts of God." In this picture,,five acts of God are as important as everything else.,In other words,,it is not acts of God that we should put aside.,That is the meat, the problem.,If you master these, you master price,,and if you don't master these, you can master,the little noise as well as you can,,but it's not important.,Well, here are the curves for it. 
 Now, I get to the final thing, which is the set,of which my name is attached.,In a way, it's the story of my life.,My adolescence was spent,during the German occupation of France.,Since I thought that I might,vanish within a day or a week,,I had very big dreams.,And after the war,,I saw an uncle again.,My uncle was a very prominent mathematician, and he told me,,"Look, there's a problem,which I could not solve 25 years ago,,and which nobody can solve.,This is a construction of a man named [Gaston] Julia,and [Pierre] Fatou.,If you could,find something new, anything,,you will get your career made.",Very simple.,So I looked,,and like the thousands of people that had tried before,,I found nothing. 
 But then the computer came,,and I decided to apply the computer,,not to new problems in mathematics --,like this wiggle wiggle, that's a new problem --,but to old problems.,And I went from what's called,real numbers, which are points on a line,,to imaginary, complex numbers,,which are points on a plane,,which is what one should do there,,and this shape came out.,This shape is of an extraordinary complication.,The equation is hidden there,,z goes into z squared, plus c.,It's so simple, so dry.,It's so uninteresting.,Now you turn the crank once, twice:,twice,,marvels come out.,I mean this comes out.,I don't want to explain these things.,This comes out. This comes out.,Shapes which are of such complication,,such harmony and such beauty.,This comes out,repeatedly, again, again, again.,And that was one of my major discoveries,,to find that these islands were the same,as the whole big thing, more or less.,And then you get these,extraordinary baroque decorations all over the place.,All that from this little formula,,which has whatever, five symbols in it.,And then this one.,The color was added for two reasons.,First of all, because these shapes,are so complicated,that one couldn't make any sense of the numbers.,And if you plot them, you must choose some system.,And so my principle has been,to always present the shapes,with different colorings,because some colorings emphasize that,,and others it is that or that.,It's so complicated. 
 (Laughter) 
 In 1990, I was in Cambridge, U.K.,to receive a prize from the university,,and three days later,,a pilot was flying over the landscape and found this thing.,So where did this come from?,Obviously, from extraterrestrials.,(Laughter),Well, so the newspaper in Cambridge,published an article about that "discovery",and received the next day,5,000 letters from people saying,,"But that's simply a Mandelbrot set very big." 
 Well, let me finish.,This shape here just came,out of an exercise in pure mathematics.,Bottomless wonders spring from simple rules,,which are repeated without end. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I'm going to talk todaynabout energy and climate.,And that might seem a bit surprising,,because my full-time worknat the foundation,is mostly about vaccines and seeds,,about the things that we neednto invent and deliver,to help the poorest two billionnlive better lives.,But energy and climatenare extremely important to these people;,in fact, more importantnthan to anyone else on the planet.,The climate getting worse meansnthat many years, their crops won't grow:,there will be too much rain,nnot enough rain;,things will change in ways their fragilenenvironment simply can't support.,And that leads to starvation, it leadsnto uncertainty, it leads to unrest.,So, the climate changesnwill be terrible for them. 
 Also, the price of energynis very important to them.,In fact, if you could pick just one thing,to lower the price of to reduce poverty,nby far you would pick energy.,Now, the price of energynhas come down over time.,Really advanced civilizationnis based on advances in energy.,The coal revolution fuelednthe Industrial Revolution,,and, even in the 1900s,nwe've seen a very rapid decline,in the price of electricity,,and that's why we havenrefrigerators, air-conditioning;,we can make modern materialsnand do so many things.,And so, we're in a wonderful situationnwith electricity in the rich world.,But as we make it cheaper --nand let's say,,let's go for making it twice as cheap --,we need to meet a new constraint,,and that constraint has to do with CO2. 
 CO2 is warming the planet,,and the equation on CO2nis actually a very straightforward one.,If you sum up the CO2 that gets emitted,,that leads to a temperature increase,,and that temperature increasenleads to some very negative effects:,the effects on the weather;nperhaps worse, the indirect effects,,in that the natural ecosystemsncan't adjust to these rapid changes,,and so you get ecosystem collapses. 
 Now, the exact amount of how you mapnfrom a certain increase of CO2,to what temperature will be,nand where the positive feedbacks are --,there's some uncertainty there,nbut not very much.,And there's certainly uncertaintynabout how bad those effects will be,,but they will be extremely bad.,I asked the top scientistsnon this several times:,Do we really have to getndown to near zero?,Can't we just cut it in half or a quarter?,And the answer is,nuntil we get near to zero,,the temperature will continue to rise.,And so that's a big challenge.,It's very different than saying,,"We're a twelve-foot-high truckntrying to get under a ten-foot bridge,,and we can just sort of squeeze under.",This is something that has to get to zero. 
 Now, we put out a lotnof carbon dioxide every year --,over 26 billion tons.,For each American, it's about 20 tons.,For people in poor countries,nit's less than one ton.,It's an average of about five tonsnfor everyone on the planet.,And somehow, we have to make changesnthat will bring that down to zero.,It's been constantly going up.,It's only various economic changesnthat have even flattened it at all,,so we have to gonfrom rapidly rising to falling,,and falling all the way to zero. 
 This equation has four factors,na little bit of multiplication.,So you've got a thing on the left,nCO2, that you want to get to zero,,and that's going to be basednon the number of people,,the services each personnis using on average,,the energy, on average, for each service,,and the CO2 being put outnper unit of energy.,So let's look at each one of these,,and see how we can get this down to zero.,Probably, one of these numbers is goingnto have to get pretty near to zero. 
 (Laughter) 
 That's back from high school algebra.,But let's take a look. 
 First, we've got population.,The world today has 6.8 billion people.,That's headed up to about nine billion.,Now, if we do a really great jobnon new vaccines,,health care, reproductive health services,,we could lower that by,nperhaps, 10 or 15 percent.,But there, we seenan increase of about 1.3. 
 The second factor is the services we use.,This encompasses everything:,the food we eat, clothing, TV, heating.,These are very good things.,Getting rid of poverty meansnproviding these services,to almost everyone on the planet.,And it's a great thingnfor this number to go up.,In the rich world, perhapsnthe top one billion,,we probably could cut back and use less,,but every year, this number,non average, is going to go up,,and so, overall,nthat will more than double,the services delivered per person.,Here we have a very basic service:,Do you have lighting in your housento be able to read your homework?,And, in fact, these kids don't,,so they're going out and readingntheir schoolwork,under the street lamps. 
 Now, efficiency, "E,"nthe energy for each service --,here, finally we have some good news.,We have something that's not going up.,Through various inventionsnand new ways of doing lighting,,through different types of cars,ndifferent ways of building buildings --,there are a lot of services,where you can bring the energynfor that service down,quite substantially.,Some individual servicesneven bring it down by 90 percent.,There are other services,nlike how we make fertilizer,,or how we do air transport,,where the rooms for improvementnare far, far less.,And so overall, if we're optimistic,nwe may get a reduction,of a factor of three to even,nperhaps, a factor of six.,But for these first three factors now,,we've gone from 26 billionnto, at best, maybe 13 billion tons,,and that just won't cut it. 
 So let's look at this fourth factor --nthis is going to be a key one --,and this is the amount of CO2nput out per each unit of energy.,So the question is:nCan you actually get that to zero?,If you burn coal, no.,If you burn natural gas, no.,Almost every waynwe make electricity today,,except for the emerging renewablesnand nuclear, puts out CO2.,And so, what we're going to havento do at a global scale,,is create a new system.,So we need energy miracles. 
 Now, when I use the term "miracle,"nI don't mean something that's impossible.,The microprocessor is a miracle.,The personal computer is a miracle.,The Internet and its servicesnare a miracle.,So the people here have participatednin the creation of many miracles.,Usually, we don't have a deadline,where you have to get the miraclenby a certain date.,Usually, you just kind of stand by,nand some come along, some don't.,This is a case where we actuallynhave to drive at full speed,and get a miraclenin a pretty tight timeline. 
 Now, I thought, "How couldnI really capture this?,Is there some kindnof natural illustration,,some demonstration that would grabnpeople's imagination here?",I thought back to a year agonwhen I brought mosquitoes,,and somehow people enjoyed that. 
 (Laughter) 
 It really got them involvednin the idea of, you know,,there are people who live with mosquitoes.,With energy, all I couldncome up with is this.,I decided that releasing fireflies,would be my contributionnto the environment here this year.,So here we have some natural fireflies.,I'm told they don't bite; in fact,nthey might not even leave that jar. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, there's all sorts of gimmickynsolutions like that one,,but they don't really add up to much.,We need solutions, either one or several,,that have unbelievable scalenand unbelievable reliability.,And although there's many directionsnthat people are seeking,,I really only see fiventhat can achieve the big numbers.,I've left out tide,ngeothermal, fusion, biofuels.,Those may make some contribution,,and if they can do betternthan I expect, so much the better.,But my key point herenis that we're going to have to work on,each of these five,,and we can't give up any of themnbecause they look daunting,,because they all havensignificant challenges. 
 Let's look first at burning fossil fuels,,either burning coalnor burning natural gas.,What you need to do there seemsnlike it might be simple, but it's not.,And that's to take all the CO2,,after you've burned it,ngoing out the flue,,pressurize it, create a liquid,nput it somewhere,,and hope it stays there.,Now, we have some pilot things,that do this at the 60 to 80npercent level.,But getting up to that full percentage --nthat will be very tricky.,And agreeing on where these CO2nquantities should be put will be hard,,but the toughest one herenis this long-term issue:,Who's going to be sure?,Who's going to guarantee,something that is literallynbillions of times larger,than any type of waste you think ofnin terms of nuclear or other things?,This is a lot of volume.,So that's a tough one. 
 Next would be nuclear.,It also has three big problems:,cost, particularly in highlynregulated countries, is high;,the issue of safety, really feeling goodnabout nothing could go wrong,,that, even though you haventhese human operators,,the fuel doesn't get used for weapons.,And then what do you do with the waste?,Although it's not very large,nthere are a lot of concerns about that.,People need to feel good about it.,So three very tough problemsnthat might be solvable,,and so, should be worked on. 
 The last three of the five,nI've grouped together.,These are what people often refer tonas the renewable sources.,And they actually -- although it's greatnthey don't require fuel --,they have some disadvantages.,One is that the density of energyngathered in these technologies,is dramatically less than a power plant.,This is energy farming,,so you're talking about many square miles,nthousands of times more area,than you think ofnas a normal energy plant.,Also, these are intermittent sources.,The sun doesn't shine all day,nit doesn't shine every day,,and likewise, the windndoesn't blow all the time.,And so, if you depend on these sources,,you have to have some waynof getting the energy,during those time periodsnthat it's not available.,So we've got big cost challenges here.,We have transmission challenges;,for example, say this energy sourcenis outside your country,,you not only need the technology,,but you have to deal with the risknof the energy coming from elsewhere. 
 And, finally, this storage problem.,To dimensionalize this,,I went through and lookednat all the types of batteries made --,for cars, for computers, for phones,nfor flashlights, for everything --,and compared that to the amountnof electrical energy the world uses.,What I found is that allnthe batteries we make now,could store less than 10 minutesnof all the energy.,And so, in fact, we needna big breakthrough here,,something that's going to bena factor of 100 better,than the approaches we have now.,It's not impossible,nbut it's not a very easy thing.,Now, this shows up when you trynto get the intermittent source,to be above, say, 20 to 30 percentnof what you're using.,If you're counting on it for 100 percent,,you need an incredible miracle battery. 
 Now, how are we going to go forwardnon this -- what's the right approach?,Is it a Manhattan Project?nWhat's the thing that can get us there?,Well, we need lots of companiesnworking on this -- hundreds.,In each of these five paths,nwe need at least a hundred people.,A lot of them, you'll look atnand say, "They're crazy.",That's good.,And, I think, here in the TED group,,we have many peoplenwho are already pursuing this.,Bill Gross has several companies,nincluding one called eSolar,that has some greatnsolar thermal technologies.,Vinod Khosla is investingnin dozens of companies,that are doing great thingsnand have interesting possibilities,,and I'm trying to help back that.,Nathan Myhrvold and Inactually are backing a company,that, perhaps surprisingly,nis actually taking the nuclear approach.,There are some innovationsnin nuclear: modular, liquid.,Innovation really stoppednin this industry quite some ago,,so the idea that there's somengood ideas laying around,is not all that surprising. 
 The idea of TerraPower is that,ninstead of burning a part of uranium --,the one percent, which is the U235 --,we decided, "Let's burnnthe 99 percent, the U238.",It is kind of a crazy idea.,In fact, people had talkednabout it for a long time,,but they could never simulate properlynwhether it would work or not,,and so it's through the adventnof modern supercomputers,that now you can simulatenand see that, yes,,with the right materials approach,nthis looks like it would work. 
 And because you're burningnthat 99 percent,,you have greatly improved cost profile.,You actually burn up the waste,nand you can actually use as fuel,all the leftover wastenfrom today's reactors.,So instead of worrying about them,nyou just take that, it's a great thing.,It breeds this uranium as it goes along,nso it's kind of like a candle.,You see it's a log there, oftennreferred to as a traveling wave reactor.,In terms of fuel,nthis really solves the problem.,I've got a picture herenof a place in Kentucky.,This is the leftover, the 99 percent,,where they've taken outnthe part they burn now,,so it's called depleted uranium.,That would power the USnfor hundreds of years.,And simply by filtering seawaternin an inexpensive process,,you'd have enough fuel for the entirenlifetime of the rest of the planet. 
 So, you know, it's got lotsnof challenges ahead,,but it is an example of the manynhundreds and hundreds of ideas,that we need to move forward.,So let's think: How shouldnwe measure ourselves?,What should our report card look like?,Well, let's go out to wherenwe really need to get,,and then look at the intermediate.,For 2050, you've heard many peoplentalk about this 80 percent reduction.,That really is very important,nthat we get there.,And that 20 percent will be used upnby things going on in poor countries --,still some agriculture; hopefully,nwe will have cleaned up forestry, cement.,So, to get to that 80 percent,,the developed countries,nincluding countries like China,,will have had to switchntheir electricity generation altogether.,The other grade is: Are we deployingnthis zero-emission technology,,have we deployed itnin all the developed countries,and are in the processnof getting it elsewhere?,That's super important.,That's a key elementnof making that report card. 
 Backing up from there, what shouldnthe 2020 report card look like?,Well, again, it should haventhe two elements.,We should go through these efficiencynmeasures to start getting reductions:,The less we emit,nthe less that sum will be of CO2,,and therefore, the less the temperature.,But in some ways, the grade we get there,,doing things that don't get usnall the way to the big reductions,,is only equally, or maybe even slightlynless, important than the other,,which is the piece of innovationnon these breakthroughs. 
 These breakthroughs,nwe need to move those at full speed,,and we can measure thatnin terms of companies,,pilot projects, regulatory thingsnthat have been changed.,There's a lot of great booksnthat have been written about this.,The Al Gore book, "Our Choice,",and the David MacKay book,n"Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air.",They really go through itnand create a framework,that this can be discussed broadly,,because we need broad backing for this.,There's a lot that has to come together. 
 So this is a wish.,It's a very concrete wishnthat we invent this technology.,If you gave me only one wishnfor the next 50 years --,I could pick who's president,,I could pick a vaccine,nwhich is something I love,,or I could pick that this thing,that's half the cost with no CO2ngets invented --,this is the wish I would pick.,This is the one with the greatest impact.,If we don't get this wish,,the division between the peoplenwho think short term and long term,will be terrible,,between the US and China,nbetween poor countries and rich,,and most of all,,the lives of those two billionnwill be far worse. 
 So what do we have to do?,What am I appealing to younto step forward and drive?,We need to go for more research funding.,When countries get togethernin places like Copenhagen,,they shouldn't just discuss the CO2.,They should discussnthis innovation agenda.,You'd be stunned at the ridiculouslynlow levels of spending,on these innovative approaches.,We do need the market incentives --nCO2 tax, cap and trade --,something that getsnthat price signal out there.,We need to get the message out.,We need to have this dialoguenbe a more rational,,more understandable dialogue,,including the stepsnthat the government takes.,This is an important wish,nbut it is one I think we can achieve. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause),(Applause ends) 
 Thank you. 
 Chris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 CA: Thank you.,So to understand more about TerraPower.,I mean, first of all, can you give a sensenof what scale of investment this is? 
 Bill Gates: To actually do the software,nbuy the supercomputer,,hire all the great scientists,nwhich we've done,,that's only tens of millions.,And even once we test our materials outnin a Russian reactor,to make sure our materials work properly,,then you'll only be upnin the hundreds of millions.,The tough thingnis building the pilot reactor --,finding the several billion,nfinding the regulator, the location,that will actually buildnthe first one of these.,Once you get the first one built,nif it works as advertised,,then it's just clear as day,,because the economics,nthe energy density, are so different,than nuclear as we know it. 
 CA: So to understand it right,,this involves buildingndeep into the ground,,almost like a vertical columnnof nuclear fuel, of this spent uranium,,and then the process startsnat the top and kind of works down? 
 BG: That's right.,Today, you're alwaysnrefueling the reactor,,so you have lots of people and lotsnof controls that can go wrong,,where you're opening it upnand moving things in and out --,that's not good.,So if you have very -- 
 (Laughter) 
 very cheap fuelnthat you can put 60 years in --,just think of it as a log --,put it down and not haventhose same complexities.,And it just sits there and burnsnfor the 60 years, and then it's done. 
 CA: It's a nuclear power plantnthat is its own waste disposal solution. 
 BG: Yeah; what happens with the waste,,you can let it sit there -- there's a lotnless waste under this approach --,then you can actually take that,and put it into another one and burn that.,And we start out, actually,nby taking the waste that exists today,that's sitting in these cooling poolsnor dry-casking by reactors --,that's our fuel to begin with.,So the thing that's been a problemnfrom those reactors,is actually what gets fed into ours,,and you're reducing the volumenof the waste quite dramatically,as you're going through this process. 
 CA: You're talkingnto different people around the world,about the possibilities.,Where is there most interestnin actually doing something with this? 
 BG: Well, we haven't pickedna particular place,,and there's all these interestingndisclosure rules,about anything that's called "nuclear.",So we've got a lot of interest.,People from the companynhave been in Russia, India, China.,I've been back seeingnthe secretary of energy here,,talking about how this fitsninto the energy agenda.,So I'm optimistic.,The French and Japanesenhave done some work.,This is a variant on somethingnthat has been done.,It's an important advance,nbut it's like a fast reactor,,and a lot of countries have built them,,so anybody who's donena fast reactor is a candidate,to be where the first one gets built. 
 CA: So, in your mind,,timescale and likelihood of actuallyntaking something like this live? 
 BG: Well, we need -- for one of thesenhigh-scale, electro-generation things,that's very cheap,,we have 20 years to inventnand then 20 years to deploy.,That's sort of the deadline,that the environmental modelsnhave shown us that we have to meet.,And TerraPower -- if things go well,nwhich is wishing for a lot --,could easily meet that.,And there are, fortunatelynnow, dozens of companies --,we need it to be hundreds --,who, likewise, if their science goes well,,if the funding for their pilotnplants goes well,,that they can compete for this.,And it's best if multiple succeed,,because then you could usena mix of these things.,We certainly need one to succeed. 
 CA: In terms of big-scalenpossible game changers,,is this the biggestnthat you're aware of out there? 
 BG: An energy breakthroughnis the most important thing.,It would have been, evennwithout the environmental constraint,,but the environmental constraintnjust makes it so much greater.,In the nuclear space,nthere are other innovators.,You know, we don't know their worknas well as we know this one,,but the modular people,nthat's a different approach.,There's a liquid-type reactor,nwhich seems a little hard,,but maybe they say that about us.,And so, there are different ones,,but the beauty of thisnis a molecule of uranium,has a million times as much energynas a molecule of, say, coal.,And so, if you canndeal with the negatives,,which are essentially the radiation,nthe footprint and cost,,the potential, in terms of effectnon land and various things,,is almost in a class of its own. 
 CA: If this doesn't work, then what?,Do we have to start takingnemergency measures,to try and keep the temperaturenof the earth stable? 
 BG: If you get into that situation,,it's like if you've been overeating,nand you're about to have a heart attack.,Then where do you go?,You may need heart surgery or something.,There is a line of researchnon what's called geoengineering,,which are various techniquesnthat would delay the heating,to buy us 20 or 30 yearsnto get our act together.,Now, that's just an insurance policy;nyou hope you don't need to do that.,Some people say you shouldn't evennwork on the insurance policy,because it might make you lazy,,that you'll keep eating because you knownheart surgery will be there to save you.,I'm not sure that's wise,ngiven the importance of the problem,,but there's nownthe geoengineering discussion,about: Should that be in the backnpocket in case things happen faster,,or this innovation goesna lot slower than we expect? 
 CA: Climate skeptics:,If you had a sentence or twonto say to them,,how might you persuade themnthat they're wrong? 
 BG: Well, unfortunately,nthe skeptics come in different camps.,The ones who make scientificnarguments are very few.,Are they saying there's negativenfeedback effects,that have to do with cloudsnthat offset things?,There are very, very few thingsnthat they can even say,there's a chancenin a million of those things.,The main problem we have here --nit's kind of like with AIDS:,you make the mistake now,nand you pay for it a lot later. 
 And so, when you havenall sorts of urgent problems,,the idea of taking pain nownthat has to do with a gain later,,and a somewhat uncertain pain thing.,In fact, the IPCC report --nthat's not necessarily the worst case,,and there are people in the rich worldnwho look at IPCC and say,,"OK, that isn't that big of a deal.",The fact is it's that uncertain partnthat should move us towards this.,But my dream here is that,,if you can make it economic,nand meet the CO2 constraints,,then the skeptics say,,"OK, I don't carenthat it doesn't put out CO2,,I kind of wish it did put out CO2.,But I guess I'll accept it,,because it's cheapernthan what's come before." 
 (Applause) 
 CA: So that would be your responsento the Bjørn Lomborg argument,,basically if you spend all this energyntrying to solve the CO2 problem,,it's going to take awaynall your other goals,of trying to rid the worldnof poverty and malaria and so forth,,it's a stupid wastenof the Earth's resources,to put money towards that,when there are better things we can do. 
 BG: Well, the actualnspending on the R&amp;D piece --,say the US should spend 10 billion a yearnmore than it is right now --,it's not that dramatic.,It shouldn't take away from other things.,The thing you get into big money on,nand reasonable people can disagree,,is when you have somethingnthat's non-economic,and you're trying to fund that --,that, to me, mostly is a waste.,Unless you're very close,,and you're just funding the learning curvenand it's going to get very cheap,,I believe we should try more things,that have a potentialnto be far less expensive.,If the trade-off you get into is,n"Let's make energy super expensive,",then the rich can afford that.,I mean, all of us here could paynfive times as much for our energy,and not change our lifestyle.,The disaster is for that two billion. 
 And even Lomborg has changed.,His shtick now is, "Why isn't the R&amp;Dngetting more discussed?",He's still, because of his earlier stuff,,still associated with the skeptic camp,,but he's realizednthat's a pretty lonely camp,,and so, he's making the R&amp;D point.,And so there is a thread of somethingnthat I think is appropriate.,The R&amp;D piece --nit's crazy how little it's funded. 
 CA: Well, Bill, I suspect I speaknon behalf of most people here,to say I really hope your wish comes true.,Thank you so much. 
 BG: Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm going to talk about the simple truth in leadership,in the 21st century.,In the 21st century, we need to actually look at --,and what I'm actually going to encourage you to consider today --,is to go back to our school days,when we learned how to count.,But I think it's time for us to think about what we count.,Because what we actually count,truly counts. 
 Let me start by telling you a little story.,This is Van Quach.,She came to this country in 1986 from Vietnam.,She changed her name to Vivian,because she wanted to fit in here in America.,Her first job was at an inner-city motel,in San Francisco as a maid.,I happened to buy that motel,about three months after Vivian started working there.,So Vivian and I have been working together for 23 years. 
 With the youthful idealism of a 26-year-old,,in 1987,,I started my company and I called it Joie de Vivre,,a very impractical name,,because I actually was looking to create joy of life.,And this first hotel that I bought, motel,,was a pay-by-the-hour, no-tell motel,in the inner-city of San Francisco.,As I spent time with Vivian,,I saw that she had sort of a joie de vivre,in how she did her work.,It made me question and curious:,How could someone actually find joy,in cleaning toilets for a living?,So I spent time with Vivian, and I saw that,she didn't find joy in cleaning toilets.,Her job, her goal and her calling,was not to become the world's greatest toilet scrubber.,What counts for Vivian was the emotional connection,she created with her fellow employees and our guests.,And what gave her inspiration and meaning,was the fact that she was taking care of people,who were far away from home.,Because Vivian knew what it was like to be far away from home. 
 That very human lesson,,more than 20 years ago,,served me well during the last,economic downturn we had.,In the wake of the dotcom crash and 9/11,,San Francisco Bay Area hotels,went through the largest percentage revenue drop,in the history of American hotels.,We were the largest operator of hotels in the Bay Area,,so we were particularly vulnerable.,But also back then,,remember we stopped eating French fries in this country.,Well, not exactly, of course not.,We started eating "freedom fries,",and we started boycotting anything that was French.,Well, my name of my company, Joie de Vivre --,so I started getting these letters,from places like Alabama and Orange County,saying to me that they were going to boycott my company,because they thought we were a French company.,And I'd write them back, and I'd say, "What a minute. We're not French.,We're an American company. We're based in San Francisco.",And I'd get a terse response: "Oh, that's worse." 
 (Laughter) 
 So one particular day,when I was feeling a little depressed and not a lot of joie de vivre,,I ended up in the local bookstore around the corner from our offices.,And I initially ended up in the business section of the bookstore,looking for a business solution.,But given my befuddled state of mind, I ended up,in the self-help section very quickly.,That's where I got reacquainted with,Abraham Maslow's "hierarchy of needs.",I took one psychology class in college,,and I learned about this guy, Abraham Maslow,,as many of us are familiar with his hierarchy of needs.,But as I sat there for four hours,,the full afternoon, reading Maslow,,I recognized something,that is true of most leaders.,One of the simplest facts in business,is something that we often neglect,,and that is that we're all human.,Each of us, no matter what our role is in business,,has some hierarchy of needs,in the workplace. 
 So as I started reading more Maslow,,what I started to realize is that,Maslow, later in his life,,wanted to take this hierarchy for the individual,and apply it to the collective,,to organizations and specifically to business.,But unfortunately, he died prematurely in 1970,,and so he wasn't really able to live that dream completely.,So I realized in that dotcom crash,that my role in life was to channel Abe Maslow.,And that's what I did a few years ago,when I took that five-level hierarchy of needs pyramid,and turned it into what I call the transformation pyramid,,which is survival, success and transformation.,It's not just fundamental in business, it's fundamental in life.,And we started asking ourselves the questions,about how we were actually addressing,the higher needs, these transformational needs,for our key employees in the company.,These three levels of the hierarchy needs,relate to the five levels,of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. 
 But as we started asking ourselves about how we were addressing,the higher needs of our employees and our customers,,I realized we had no metrics.,We had nothing that actually could tell us whether we were actually getting it right.,So we started asking ourselves:,What kind of less obvious metrics,could we use to actually evaluate,our employees' sense of meaning,,or our customers' sense of emotional connection with us?,For example, we actually started asking our employees,,do they understand the mission of our company,,and do they feel like they believe in it,,can they actually influence it,,and do they feel that their work actually has an impact on it?,We started asking our customers,,did they feel an emotional connection with us,,in one of seven different kinds of ways.,Miraculously, as we asked these questions,and started giving attention higher up the pyramid,,what we found is we created more loyalty.,Our customer loyalty skyrocketed.,Our employee turnover dropped,to one-third of the industry average,,and during that five year dotcom bust,,we tripled in size. 
 As I went out and started spending time with other leaders out there,and asking them how they were getting through that time,,what they told me over and over again,was that they just manage what they can measure.,What we can measure is that tangible stuff,at the bottom of the pyramid.,They didn't even see the intangible stuff,higher up the pyramid.,So I started asking myself the question:,How can we get leaders to start valuing the intangible?,If we're taught as leaders to just manage what we can measure,,and all we can measure is the tangible in life,,we're missing a whole lot of things at the top of the pyramid. 
 So I went out and studied a bunch of things,,and I found a survey that showed,that 94 percent,of business leaders worldwide,believe that the intangibles are important in their business,,things like intellectual property,,their corporate culture, their brand loyalty,,and yet, only five percent of those same leaders,actually had a means of measuring the intangibles in their business.,So as leaders, we understand,that intangibles are important,,but we don't have a clue how to measure them.,So here's another Einstein quote:,"Not everything that can be counted counts,,and not everything that counts can be counted.",I hate to argue with Einstein,,but if that which is most valuable,in our life and our business,actually can't be counted or valued,,aren't we going to spend our lives,just mired in measuring the mundane? 
 It was that sort of heady question about what counts,that led me to take my CEO hat off for a week,and fly off to the Himalayan peaks.,I flew off to a place that's been shrouded in mystery for centuries,,a place some folks call Shangri-La.,It's actually moved from the survival base of the pyramid,to becoming a transformational,role model for the world.,I went to Bhutan.,The teenage king of Bhutan was also a curious man,,but this was back in 1972,,when he ascended to the throne,two days after his father passed away.,At age 17, he started asking the kinds of questions,that you'd expect of someone with a beginner's mind. 
 On a trip through India,,early in his reign as king,,he was asked by an Indian journalist,about the Bhutanese GDP,,the size of the Bhutanese GDP.,The king responded in a fashion,that actually has transformed us four decades later.,He said the following, he said: "Why are we so obsessed,and focused with gross domestic product?,Why don't we care more about,gross national happiness?",Now, in essence, the king was asking us to consider,an alternative definition of success,,what has come to be known as,GNH, or gross national happiness.,Most world leaders didn't take notice,,and those that did thought this was just "Buddhist economics.",But the king was serious.,This was a notable moment,,because this was the first time a world leader,in almost 200 years,had suggested,that intangible of happiness --,that leader 200 years ago,,Thomas Jefferson with the Declaration of Independence --,200 years later,,this king was suggesting that intangible of happiness,is something that we should measure,,and it's something we should actually value,as government officials. 
 For the next three dozen years as king,,this king actually started measuring,and managing around happiness in Bhutan --,including, just recently, taking his country,from being an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy,with no bloodshed, no coup.,Bhutan, for those of you who don't know it,,is the newest democracy in the world, just two years ago. 
 So as I spent time with leaders in the GNH movement,,I got to really understand what they're doing.,And I got to spend some time with the prime minister.,Over dinner, I asked him an impertinent question.,I asked him,,"How can you create and measure,something which evaporates --,in other words, happiness?",And he's a very wise man, and he said,,"Listen, Bhutan's goal is not to create happiness.,We create the conditions for happiness to occur.,In other words, we create a habitat of happiness.",Wow, that's interesting.,He said that they have a science behind that art,,and they've actually created four essential pillars,,nine key indicators,and 72 different metrics,that help them to measure their GNH.,One of those key indicators is:,How do the Bhutanese feel about,how they spend their time each day?,It's a good question. How do you feel about,how you spend your time each day?,Time is one of the scarcest resources,in the modern world.,And yet, of course,,that little intangible piece of data,doesn't factor into our GDP calculations. 
 As I spent my week up in the Himalayas,,I started to imagine,what I call an emotional equation.,And it focuses on something I read long ago,from a guy named Rabbi Hyman Schachtel.,How many know him? Anybody?,1954, he wrote a book called "The Real Enjoyment of Living,",and he suggested that happiness,is not about having what you want;,instead, it's about wanting what you have.,Or in other words, I think the Bhutanese believe,happiness equals wanting what you have --,imagine gratitude --,divided by having what you want --,gratification.,The Bhutanese aren't on some aspirational treadmill,,constantly focused on what they don't have.,Their religion, their isolation,,their deep respect for their culture,and now the principles of their GNH movement,all have fostered a sense of gratitude,about what they do have.,How many of us here, as TEDsters in the audience,,spend more of our time,in the bottom half of this equation, in the denominator?,We are a bottom-heavy culture,in more ways than one. 
 (Laughter) 
 The reality is, in Western countries,,quite often we do focus on the pursuit of happiness,as if happiness is something that we have to go out --,an object that we're supposed to get, or maybe many objects.,Actually, in fact, if you look in the dictionary,,many dictionaries define pursuit,as to "chase with hostility.",Do we pursue happiness with hostility?,Good question. But back to Bhutan. 
 Bhutan's bordered on its north and south,by 38 percent of the world's population.,Could this little country,,like a startup in a mature industry,,be the spark plug that influences,a 21st century,of middle-class in China and India?,Bhutan's created the ultimate export,,a new global currency of well-being,,and there are 40 countries around the world today,that are studying their own GNH.,You may have heard, this last fall,Nicolas Sarkozy in France,announcing the results of an 18-month study,by two Nobel economists,,focusing on happiness and wellness in France.,Sarkozy suggested that,world leaders should stop,myopically focusing on GDP,and consider a new index,,what some French are calling a "joie de vivre index.",I like it.,Co-branding opportunities. 
 Just three days ago, three days ago here at TED,,we had a simulcast of David Cameron,,potentially the next prime minister of the UK,,quoting one of my favorite speeches of all-time,,Robert Kennedy's poetic speech from 1968,when he suggested that we're,myopically focused on the wrong thing,and that GDP is a misplaced metric.,So it suggests that the momentum is shifting. 
 I've taken that Robert Kennedy quote,,and I've turned it into a new balance sheet for just a moment here.,This is a collection of things,that Robert Kennedy said in that quote.,GDP counts everything from air pollution,to the destruction of our redwoods.,But it doesn't count the health of our children,or the integrity of our public officials.,As you look at these two columns here,,doesn't it make you feel like it's time for us,to start figuring out a new way to count,,a new way to imagine,what's important to us in life? 
 (Applause) 
 Certainly Robert Kennedy suggested at the end of the speech exactly that.,He said GDP "measures everything in short,,except that which makes life worthwhile.",Wow.,So how do we do that?,Let me say one thing we can just start doing,ten years from now, at least in this country.,Why in the heck in America,are we doing a census in 2010?,We're spending 10 billion dollars on the census.,We're asking 10 simple questions -- it is simplicity.,But all of those questions are tangible.,They're about demographics.,They're about where you live, how many people you live with,,and whether you own your home or not.,That's about it.,We're not asking meaningful metrics.,We're not asking important questions.,We're not asking anything that's intangible. 
 Abe Maslow said long ago,something you've heard before, but you didn't realize it was him.,He said, "If the only tool you have is a hammer,,everything starts to look like a nail.",We've been fooled by our tool.,Excuse that expression.,(Laughter),We've been fooled by our tool.,GDP has been our hammer.,And our nail has been a 19th- and 20th-century,industrial-era model of success.,And yet, 64 percent,of the world's GDP today,is in that intangible industry we call service,,the service industry, the industry I'm in.,And only 36 percent is in the tangible industries,of manufacturing and agriculture.,So maybe it's time that we get a bigger toolbox, right?,Maybe it's time we get a toolbox that,doesn't just count what's easily counted, the tangible in life,,but actually counts what we most value,,the things that are intangible. 
 I guess I'm sort of a curious CEO.,I was also a curious economics major as an undergrad.,I learned that economists measure everything,in tangible units of production and consumption,as if each of those tangible units,is exactly the same.,They aren't the same.,In fact, as leaders, what we need to learn,is that we can influence,the quality of that unit of production,by creating the conditions,for our employees to live their calling.,In Vivian's case,,her unit of production,isn't the tangible hours she works,,it's the intangible difference she makes,during that one hour of work. 
 This is Dave Arringdale who's actually,been a longtime guest at Vivian's motel.,He stayed there a hundred times,in the last 20 years,,and he's loyal to the property because of the relationship,that Vivian and her fellow employees have created with him.,They've created a habitat of happiness for Dave.,He tells me that he can always count,on Vivian and the staff there,to make him feel at home.,Why is it that,business leaders and investors,quite often don't see the connection,between creating the intangible,of employee happiness,with creating the tangible,of financial profits in their business?,We don't have to choose between,inspired employees and sizable profits,,we can have both.,In fact, inspired employees quite often,help make sizable profits, right? 
 So what the world needs now,,in my opinion,,is business leaders and political leaders,who know what to count.,We count numbers.,We count on people.,What really counts is when we actually use our numbers,to truly take into account our people.,I learned that from a maid in a motel,and a king of a country.,What can you,start counting today?,What one thing can you start counting today,that actually would be meaningful in your life,,whether it's your work life or your business life? 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Tom Green: That's a 4chan thing.,These kids on the Internet, they have this group of kids,and they like to say funny words,like "barrel roll.",It's a video game move from "Star Fox.","Star Fox 20"? (Assistant: "Star Fox 64."),Tom Green: Yeah. And they've been dogging me for a year.,I got to tell you, it's driving me nuts, actually.,Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and I scream,,"4chan!" 
 Christopher Poole: When I was 15,,I found this website called Futaba Channel.,And it was a Japanese forum and imageboard.,That format of forum, at that time,,was not well-known outside of Japan.,And so what I did is I took it, I translated it into English,,and I stuck it up for my friends to use.,Now, six and a half years later,,over seven million people are using it,,contributing over 700,000 posts per day.,And we've gone from one board,to 48 boards. 
 This is what it looks like.,So, what's unique about the site,is that it's anonymous,,and it has no memory.,There's no archive, there are no barriers, there's no registration.,These things that we're used to with forums,don't exist on 4chan.,And that's led to this,discussion that's completely raw, completely unfiltered.,What the site's known for,,because it has this environment,,is it's fostered the creation of a lot of,Internet phenomena, viral videos and whatnot, known as "memes." 
 Two of the largest memes that have come out of this site,some of you might be familiar with are these LOLcats --,just silly pictures of cats with text.,And this resonates with millions of people, apparently,,because there are tens of thousands of these,,and there is a whole blogging empire now,dedicated to pictures like these.,And Rick Astley's kind of rebirth,these past two years ...,Rickroll was this bait and switch,,really simple, classic bait and switch.,Somebody says they're linking to something interesting,,and you get an '80s pop song. That's all it was.,And it got big enough to the point where,there was a float last year at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade,,and Rick Astley pops out, and rickrolls,millions of people on television.,(Laughter) 
 There are thousands of memes that come out of the site.,There are a handful that have escaped into the mainstream,,the ones I've just shown you,,but every day, every month,,people are producing thousands of these. 
 So does a site like this have rules?,We do; they're the codified rules that I've come up with,,which are more-or-less ignored by the community.,And so they've come up with their own set of rules,,the "Rules of the Internet.",And so there are three that I want to show you specifically.,Rule one is you don't talk about /b/.,Two is you do not talk about /b/.,And this one's kind of interesting:,"If it exists, there is porn of it. No exceptions.",(Laughter),And I will spare you that slide.,I assure you, it is very true. 
 /b/ is the first board we started with,,and it is, in many ways,,the beating heart of the website.,It is where a third of all the traffic is going.,And /b/ is known for,,more than anything,,not just the memes they've created, but the exploits.,And Chris just touched on one of those a second ago,,and that was the Time 100 poll.,So somebody at Time, at the magazine,,thought it would be fun to nominate me,for this thing they did last year.,And so they placed me on it,,and the Internet got wind of it. My community,decided they wanted me to win it.,I didn't instruct them to do it; they just decided that that's what they wanted.,And so, you know, 390 percent approval rating ain't so bad.,(Laughter),So they broke that poll.,And I ended up on top.,I ended up at this really fancy party. 
 But that's not what's interesting about this.,It's that they weren't putting me at the top of this list;,they were actually --,it got so sophisticated to the point where they gamed,all of the top 21 places,to spell "mARBLECAKE. ALSO, THE GAME.",(Laughter),The amount of time and effort that went into that,is absolutely incredible.,And "marble cake" is significant because,it is the channel that this group called Anonymous organized.,Anonymous is this group of people,that protested, very famously,,Scientology.,The story is,,Scientology had this embarrassing video of Tom Cruise. It went up online.,They got it taken offline and managed to piss off part of the Internet.,And so these people, over 7,000 people,,less than one month later,,organized in a hundred cities around the globe and --,this is L.A. --,protested the Church of Scientology,,and they have continued to do so,,now, two full years after the fact.,They are still protesting.,(Laughter),So we've got this activist group that's this grassroots group,that's come out of the site. 
 And last, I'm going to show you the example,,the story of Dusty the cat.,Dusty is the name that we've given to this cat.,This young man,posted a video,of him abusing his cat on YouTube.,And, you know, this didn't sit well with people,,and so there was this outpouring of support,for people to do something about this.,So what they did is they -- I mean, they put CSI to shame here --,the Internet detectives came out.,They matched, they found his MySpace.,They took the YouTube video and they mashed everything in the video.,Within 24 hours,,they had his name,,and within 48 hours, he was arrested. 
 (Applause) 
 And so, what I think is really intriguing,about a community like 4chan,is just that it's this open place.,As I said, it's raw, it's unfiltered.,And sites like it are kind of,going the way of the dinosaur right now.,They're endangered because we're moving,towards social networking.,We're moving towards persistent identity.,We're moving towards,,you know, a lack of privacy, really.,We're sacrificing a lot of that, and I think in doing so,,moving towards those things, we're losing something valuable. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: Thank you.,Got a couple questions for you.,But if I ask them, is the TED website going to go down? 
 CP: You're lucky that this is not,being streamed to them live right now. 
 CA: Well, you never know. Some of them --,we've got people in 75 countries out there watching.,Don't tell.,But seriously,,this issue on anonymity is --,I mean, you made the case there.,But anonymity basically allows people to say anything,,all the rules gone.,You've had to wrestle with issues like child pornography.,And I'm just curious whether you,sometimes lie awake in the night,worrying that you've opened Pandora's box. 
 CP: Yes and no.,I mean, for as much good,that kind of comes out of this environment,,there is plenty of bad.,There are plenty of downsides.,But I think that the greater good,is being served here by just allowing people --,there are very few places, now, where you can go,and not have identity, to be completely anonymous,and say whatever you'd like.,And saying whatever you like, I think, is powerful.,Doing whatever you like is now crossing a line.,But I think it's important to have these places.,When I get emails, people say, "Thank you for giving me this place,,this outlet, where I can come after work,and be myself." 
 CA: But words, saying things,,you know, can be constructive; it can be really damaging.,And if you cut the link between what is said,and any attribution back to you,,I mean, surely there are huge risks with that. 
 CP: There are, certainly.,But -- 
 CA: Tell me about what -- I mean, I think you asked the board,what you might say at TED, right? 
 CP: Yeah, I posted a thread,on Sunday.,And within 24 hours,,it had over 12,000 responses.,And the thing is,,I didn't make it into that presentation,because I can't read to you anything that they said, more or less.,(Laughter),99 percent of it is just,,would have been, you know, bleeped out.,But there were some good things that came out of that too.,(Laughter),Love and peace were mentioned. 
 CA: Love and peace were mentioned,,kind of with quote marks around them, right? 
 CP: Cats and dogs were mentioned too.,CA: And that content is all off the board now.,Right, it's gone? Or is it still up there? 
 CP: I stuck that thread so it lasted a few days.,It went up to about 16,000 posts,,and now it has been taken off. 
 CA: Okay, well.,Now, I'm not sure I would have necessarily recommended,everyone at TED to go and check it out anyway.,Chris, you yourself? I mean, you're a figure of some intrigue.,You've got this surprising,semi-underground influence,,but it's not making you a lot of money, yet.,What's the commercial picture here? 
 CP: The commercial picture is that there really isn't,much of one, I guess.,The site has adult content on it.,I mean, obviously, it's got some very offensive, obscene content on it,,just in terms of language alone.,And when you've got that, you've pretty much sacrificed,any hope of making lots of money. 
 CA: But you still live at home, right? 
 CP: I actually moved out recently. 
 CA: That's very cool. 
 (Applause) 
 CP: I got out of Mom's, and I'm back in school right now. 
 CA: But what conversations did you or do you,have with your mother about 4chan? 
 CP: At first, very kind of pained,,awkward conversations.,The content is not dinner table conversation in the least.,But my parents -- I think part of why,they kind of are able to appreciate it,is because they don't understand it.,(Laughter),CA: And they were probably pleased to see you,on top of the Time poll. 
 CP: Yeah. They still didn't know what to think of that though. 
 (Laughter) 
 CA: And so, in 10 years' time,,what do you picture yourself doing? 
 CP: That's a good question.,As I said, I just went back to school,,and I am considering,majoring in urban studies,and then going on to urban planning,,kind of taking whatever I've learned from online communities,and trying to adapt that,to a physical community. 
 CA: Chris, thank you. Absolutely fascinating. Thank you for coming to TED.This is the venue,where, as a young man,,some of the music that I wrote was first performed.,It was, remarkably,,a pretty good sounding room.,With all the uneven walls and all the crap everywhere,,it actually sounded pretty good.,This is a song that was recorded there.,(Music),This is not Talking Heads,,in the picture anyway.,(Music: "A Clean Break (Let's Work)" by Talking Heads),So the nature of the room,meant that words could be understood.,The lyrics of the songs could be pretty much understood.,The sound system was kind of decent.,And there wasn't a lot of reverberation in the room.,So the rhythms,could be pretty intact too,,pretty concise.,Other places around the country had similar rooms.,This is Tootsie's Orchid Lounge in Nashville.,The music was in some ways different,,but in structure and form,,very much the same.,The clientele behavior was very much the same too.,And so the bands at Tootsie's,or at CBGB's,had to play loud enough --,the volume had to be loud enough to overcome,people falling down, shouting out,and doing whatever else they were doing. 
 Since then, I've played other places,that are much nicer.,I've played the Disney Hall here,and Carnegie Hall and places like that.,And it's been very exciting.,But I also noticed that sometimes the music,that I had written,,or was writing at the time,,didn't sound all that great,in some of those halls.,We managed,,but sometimes those halls didn't seem exactly suited,to the music I was making,or had made.,So I asked myself:,Do I write stuff,for specific rooms?,Do I have a place, a venue,,in mind when I write?,Is that a kind of model for creativity?,Do we all make things with,a venue, a context, in mind? 
 Okay, Africa.,(Music: "Wenlenga" / Various artists),Most of the popular music that we know now,has a big part of its roots in West Africa.,And the music there,,I would say, the instruments,,the intricate rhythms,,the way it's played, the setting, the context,,it's all perfect. It all works perfect.,The music works perfectly in that setting.,There's no big room,to create reverberation and confuse the rhythms.,The instruments are loud enough,that they can be heard without amplification, etc., etc.,It's no accident.,It's perfect for that particular context.,And it would be a mess,in a context like this. This is a gothic cathedral.,(Music: "Spem In Alium" by Thomas Tallis),In a gothic cathedral, this kind of music is perfect.,It doesn't change key, the notes are long,,there's almost no rhythm whatsoever,,and the room flatters the music.,It actually improves it.,This is the room that Bach,wrote some of his music for. This is the organ.,It's not as big as a gothic cathedral,,so he can write things that are a little bit more intricate.,He can, very innovatively,,actually change keys,without risking huge dissonances.,(Music: "Fantasia On Jesu, Mein Freunde" by Johann S. Bach) 
 This is a little bit later.,This is the kind of rooms that Mozart wrote in.,I think we're in like 1770, somewhere around there.,They're smaller, even less reverberant,,so he can write really frilly music,that's very intricate -- and it works.,(Music: "Sonata in F," KV 13, by Wolfgang A. Mozart),It fits the room perfectly.,This is La Scala.,It's around the same time,,I think it was built around 1776.,People in the audience in these opera houses, when they were built,,they used to yell out to one another.,They used to eat, drink and yell out to people on the stage,,just like they do at CBGB's and places like that.,If they liked an aria,,they would holler and suggest,that it be done again as an encore,,not at the end of the show, but immediately.,(Laughter),And well, that was an opera experience.,This is the opera house that Wagner built for himself.,And the size of the room is not that big.,It's smaller than this.,But Wagner made an innovation.,He wanted a bigger band.,He wanted a little more bombast,,so he increased the size of the orchestra pit,so he could get more low-end instruments in there.,(Music: "Lohengrin / Prelude to Act III" by Richard Wagner) 
 Okay.,This is Carnegie Hall.,Obviously, this kind of thing became popular.,The halls got bigger. Carnegie Hall's fair-sized.,It's larger than some of the other symphony halls.,And they're a lot more reverberant,than La Scala.,Around the same,,according to Alex Ross who writes for the New Yorker,,this kind of rule came into effect,that audiences had to be quiet --,no more eating, drinking and yelling at the stage,,or gossiping with one another,during the show.,They had to be very quiet.,So those two things combined meant that,a different kind of music,worked best in these kind of halls.,It meant that there could be extreme dynamics,,which there weren't in some of these,other kinds of music.,Quiet parts could be heard,that would have been drowned out,by all the gossiping and shouting.,But because of the reverberation,in those rooms like Carnegie Hall,,the music had to be maybe a little less rhythmic,and a little more textural.,(Music: "Symphony No. 8 in E Flat Major" by Gustav Mahler),This is Mahler.,It looks like Bob Dylan, but it's Mahler.,That was Bob's last record, yeah. 
 (Laughter) 
 Popular music, coming along at the same time.,This is a jazz band.,According to Scott Joplin, the bands were playing,on riverboats and clubs.,Again, it's noisy. They're playing for dancers.,There's certain sections of the song -- the songs had different sections,that the dancers really liked.,And they'd say, "Play that part again.",Well, there's only so many times,you can play the same section of a song over and over again for the dancers.,So the bands started to improvise new melodies.,And a new form of music was born.,(Music: "Royal Garden Blues" by W.C. Handy / Ethel Waters),These are played mainly in small rooms.,People are dancing, shouting and drinking.,So the music has to be loud enough,to be heard above that.,Same thing goes true for -- that's the beginning of the century --,for the whole of 20th-century popular music,,whether it's rock or Latin music or whatever.,[Live music] doesn't really change that much. 
 It changes about a third of the way into the 20th century,,when this became,one of the primary venues for music.,And this was one way,that the music got there.,Microphones enabled singers, in particular,,and musicians and composers,,to completely change the kind of music,that they were writing.,So far, a lot of the stuff that was on the radio was live music,,but singers, like Frank Sinatra,,could use the mic,and do things,that they could never do without a microphone.,Other singers after him,went even further.,(Music: "My Funny Valentine" by Chet Baker),This is Chet Baker.,And this kind of thing,would have been impossible without a microphone.,It would have been impossible without recorded music as well.,And he's singing right into your ear.,He's whispering into your ears.,The effect is just electric.,It's like the guy is sitting next to you,,whispering who knows what into your ear. 
 So at this point, music diverged.,There's live music,,and there's recorded music.,And they no longer have to be exactly the same.,Now there's venues like this, a discotheque,,and there's jukeboxes in bars,,where you don't even need to have a band.,There doesn't need to be any,live performing musicians whatsoever,,and the sound systems are good.,People began to make music,specifically for discos,and for those sound systems.,And, as with jazz,,the dancers liked certain sections,more than they did others.,So the early hip-hop guys would loop certain sections.,(Music: "Rapper's Delight" by The Sugarhill Gang),The MC would improvise lyrics,in the same way that the jazz players would improvise melodies.,And another new form of music was born. 
 Live performance, when it was incredibly successful,,ended up in what is probably, acoustically,,the worst sounding venues on the planet:,sports stadiums,,basketball arenas and hockey arenas.,Musicians who ended up there did the best they could.,They wrote what is now called arena rock,,which is medium-speed ballads.,(Music: "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" by U2),They did the best they could,given that this is what they're writing for.,The tempos are medium. It sounds big.,It's more a social situation,than a musical situation.,And in some ways, the music,that they're writing for this place,works perfectly. 
 So there's more new venues.,One of the new ones is the automobile.,I grew up with a radio in a car.,But now that's evolved into something else.,The car is a whole venue.,(Music: "Who U Wit" by Lil' Jon & the East Side Boyz),The music that, I would say, is written,for automobile sound systems,works perfectly on it.,It might not be what you want to listen to at home,,but it works great in the car --,has a huge frequency spectrum,,you know, big bass and high-end,and the voice kind of stuck in the middle.,Automobile music, you can share with your friends. 
 There's one other kind of new venue,,the private MP3 player.,Presumably, this is just for Christian music.,(Laughter),And in some ways it's like Carnegie Hall,,or when the audience had to hush up,,because you can now hear every single detail.,In other ways, it's more like the West African music,because if the music in an MP3 player gets too quiet,,you turn it up, and the next minute,,your ears are blasted out by a louder passage.,So that doesn't really work.,I think pop music, mainly,,it's written today,,to some extent, is written for these kind of players,,for this kind of personal experience,where you can hear extreme detail,,but the dynamic doesn't change that much. 
 So I asked myself:,Okay, is this,a model for creation,,this adaptation that we do?,And does it happen anywhere else?,Well, according to David Attenborough and some other people,,birds do it too --,that the birds in the canopy,,where the foliage is dense,,their calls tend to be,high-pitched, short and repetitive.,And the birds on the floor,tend to have lower pitched calls,,so that they don't get distorted,when they bounce off the forest floor.,And birds like this Savannah sparrow,,they tend to have a buzzing,(Sound clip: Savannah sparrow song),type call.,And it turns out that,a sound like this,is the most energy efficient and practical way,to transmit their call,across the fields and savannahs.,Other birds, like this tanager,,have adapted within the same species.,The tananger on the East Coast of the United States,,where the forests are a little denser,,has one kind of call,,and the tananger on the other side, on the west,(Sound clip: Scarlet tanager song),has a different kind of call.,(Sound clip: Scarlet tanager song),So birds do it too. 
 And I thought:,Well, if this is a model for creation,,if we make music,,primarily the form at least,,to fit these contexts,,and if we make art to fit gallery walls or museum walls,,and if we write software to fit existing operating systems,,is that how it works?,Yeah. I think it's evolutionary.,It's adaptive.,But the pleasure and the passion and the joy,is still there.,This is a reverse view of things,from the kind of traditional Romantic view.,The Romantic view is that,first comes the passion,and then the outpouring of emotion,,and then somehow it gets shaped into something.,And I'm saying,,well, the passion's still there,,but the vessel,that it's going to be injected into and poured into,,that is instinctively and intuitively,created first.,We already know where that passion is going.,But this conflict of views is kind of interesting. 
 The writer,,Thomas Frank,,says that,this might be a kind of explanation,why some voters vote,against their best interests,,that voters, like a lot of us,,assume, that if they hear something that sounds like it's sincere,,that it's coming from the gut, that it's passionate,,that it's more authentic.,And they'll vote for that.,So that, if somebody can fake sincerity,,if they can fake passion,,they stand a better chance,of being selected in that way,,which seems a little dangerous.,I'm saying the two, the passion, the joy,,are not mutually exclusive. 
 Maybe what the world needs now is for us to realize,that we are like the birds.,We adapt.,We sing.,And like the birds, the joy is still there,,even though we have changed what we do,to fit the context. 
 Thank you very much.

 Thomas Dolby: David Byrne. 
 (Applause)Chris Anderson: We're having a debate.,The debate is over the proposition:,"What the world needs now,is nuclear energy." True or false?,And before we have the debate,,I'd like to actually take a show of hands --,on balance, right now, are you for or against this?,So those who are "yes," raise your hand. "For.",Okay, hands down.,Those who are against, raise your hands.,Okay, I'm reading that at about,75 to 25 in favor at the start.,Which means we're going to take a vote at the end,and see how that shifts, if at all.,So here's the format: They're going to have six minutes each,,and then after one little, quick exchange between them,,I want two people on each side of this debate in the audience,to have 30 seconds,to make one short, crisp, pungent, powerful point. 
 So, in favor of the proposition, possibly shockingly,,is one of, truly, the founders of the,environmental movement,,a long-standing TEDster, the founder of the Whole Earth Catalog,,someone we all know and love, Stewart Brand. 
 Stewart Brand: Whoa.,(Applause),The saying is that with climate, those who know the most,are the most worried.,With nuclear, those who know the most,are the least worried.,A classic example is James Hansen,,a NASA climatologist,pushing for 350 parts per million,carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.,He came out with a wonderful book recently,called "Storms of My Grandchildren.",And Hansen is hard over for nuclear power,,as are most climatologists,who are engaging this issue seriously. 
 This is the design situation:,a planet that is facing climate change,and is now half urban.,Look at the client base for this.,Five out of six of us,live in the developing world.,We are moving to cities. We are moving up in the world.,And we are educating our kids,,having fewer kids,,basically good news all around.,But we move to cities, toward the bright lights,,and one of the things that is there that we want, besides jobs,,is electricity.,And if it isn't easily gotten, we'll go ahead and steal it.,This is one of the most desired things,by poor people all over the world,,in the cities and in the countryside.,Electricity for cities, at its best,,is what's called baseload electricity.,That's where it is on,all the time.,And so far there are only three major sources of that --,coal and gas, hydro-electric,,which in most places is maxed-out --,and nuclear.,I would love to have something in the fourth place here,,but in terms of constant, clean,,scalable energy,,[solar] and wind and the other renewables,aren't there yet because they're inconstant.,Nuclear is and has been for 40 years. 
 Now, from an environmental standpoint,,the main thing you want to look at,is what happens to the waste from nuclear and from coal,,the two major sources of electricity.,If all of your electricity in your lifetime came from nuclear,,the waste from that lifetime of electricity,would go in a Coke can --,a pretty heavy Coke can, about two pounds.,But one day of coal,adds up to one hell of a lot,of carbon dioxide,in a normal one-gigawatt coal-fired plant.,Then what happens to the waste?,The nuclear waste typically goes into,a dry cask storage,out back of the parking lot at the reactor site,because most places don't have underground storage yet.,It's just as well, because it can stay where it is.,While the carbon dioxide,,vast quantities of it, gigatons,,goes into the atmosphere,where we can't get it back -- yet --,and where it is causing the problems that we're most concerned about.,So when you add up the greenhouse gases,in the lifetime of these various energy sources,,nuclear is down there with wind and hydro,,below solar and way below, obviously, all the fossil fuels. 
 Wind is wonderful; I love wind.,I love being around these,big wind generators.,But one of the things we're discovering is that,wind, like solar, is an actually relatively,dilute source of energy.,And so it takes a very large footprint on the land,,a very large footprint in terms of materials,,five to 10 times what you'd use for nuclear,,and typically to get one gigawatt of electricity,is on the order of 250 square miles,of wind farm.,In places like Denmark and Germany,,they've maxed out on wind already.,They've run out of good sites.,The power lines are getting overloaded.,And you peak out.,Likewise, with solar,,especially here in California,,we're discovering that the 80 solar farm,schemes that are going forward,want to basically bulldoze,1,000 square miles of southern California desert.,Well, as an environmentalist, we would rather that didn't happen.,It's okay on frapped-out agricultural land.,Solar's wonderful on rooftops.,But out in the landscape,,one gigawatt is on the order of 50 square miles,of bulldozed desert. 
 When you add all these things up --,Saul Griffith did the numbers and figured out,what would it take,to get 13 clean,terawatts of energy,from wind, solar and biofuels,,and that area would be roughly the size of the United States,,an area he refers to as "Renewistan.",A guy who's added it up all this very well is David Mackay,,a physicist in England,,and in his wonderful book, "Sustainable Energy," among other things,,he says, "I'm not trying to be pro-nuclear. I'm just pro-arithmetic." 
 (Laughter) 
 In terms of weapons,,the best disarmament tool so far is nuclear energy.,We have been taking down,the Russian warheads,,turning it into electricity.,Ten percent of American electricity,comes from decommissioned warheads.,We haven't even started the American stockpile.,I think of most interest to a TED audience,would be the new generation of reactors,that are very small,,down around 10,to 125 megawatts.,This is one from Toshiba.,Here's one the Russians are already building that floats on a barge.,And that would be very interesting in the developing world.,Typically, these things are put in the ground.,They're referred to as nuclear batteries.,They're incredibly safe,,weapons proliferation-proof and all the rest of it.,Here is a commercial version from New Mexico,called the Hyperion,,and another one from Oregon called NuScale.,Babcock & Wilcox that make nuclear reactors,,here's an integral fast reactor.,Thorium reactor that Nathan Myhrvold's involved in.,The governments of the world are going to have to decide,that coals need to be made expensive, and these will go ahead.,And here's the future. 
 (Applause) 
 CA: Okay. Okay.,(Applause),So arguing against,,a man who's been at the nitty, gritty heart,of the energy debate and the climate change debate for years.,In 2000, he discovered that soot,was probably the second leading cause of global warming, after CO2.,His team have been making detailed calculations,of the relative impacts,of different energy sources.,His first time at TED, possibly a disadvantage -- we shall see --,from Stanford,,Professor Mark Jacobson. Good luck. 
 Mark Jacobson: Thank you.,(Applause),So my premise here is that nuclear energy,puts out more carbon dioxide,,puts out more air pollutants,,enhances mortality more and takes longer to put up,than real renewable energy systems,,namely wind, solar,,geothermal power, hydro-tidal wave power.,And it also enhances nuclear weapons proliferation.,So let's start just by looking at the,CO2 emissions from the life cycle.,CO2e emissions are equivalent emissions,of all the greenhouse gases and particles,that cause warming,and converted to CO2.,And if you look, wind and concentrated solar,have the lowest CO2 emissions, if you look at the graph.,Nuclear -- there are two bars here.,One is a low estimate, and one is a high estimate.,The low estimate is the nuclear energy industry,estimate of nuclear.,The high is the average of 103,scientific, peer-reviewed studies.,And this is just the,CO2 from the life cycle. 
 If we look at the delays,,it takes between 10 and 19 years,to put up a nuclear power plant,from planning to operation.,This includes about three and a half to six years,for a site permit.,and another two and a half to four years,for a construction permit and issue,,and then four to nine years for actual construction.,And in China, right now,,they're putting up five gigawatts of nuclear.,And the average, just for the construction time of these,,is 7.1 years,on top of any planning times.,While you're waiting around for your nuclear,,you have to run the regular electric power grid,,which is mostly coal in the United States and around the world.,And the chart here shows the difference between,the emissions from the regular grid,,resulting if you use nuclear, or anything else,,versus wind, CSP or photovoltaics.,Wind takes about two to five years on average,,same as concentrated solar and photovoltaics.,So the difference is the opportunity cost,of using nuclear versus wind, or something else.,So if you add these two together, alone,,you can see a separation,that nuclear puts out at least nine to 17 times,more CO2 equivalent emissions than wind energy.,And this doesn't even account,for the footprint on the ground. 
 If you look at the air pollution health effects,,this is the number of deaths per year in 2020,just from vehicle exhaust.,Let's say we converted all the vehicles in the United States,to battery electric vehicles, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles,or flex fuel vehicles run on E85.,Well, right now in the United States,,50 to 100,000 people die per year from air pollution,,and vehicles are about 25,000 of those.,In 2020, the number will go down to 15,000,due to improvements.,And so, on the right, you see gasoline emissions,,the death rates of 2020.,If you go to corn or cellulosic ethanol,,you'd actually increase the death rate slightly.,If you go to nuclear,,you do get a big reduction,,but it's not as much as with wind and concentrated solar. 
 Now if you consider the fact,that nuclear weapons proliferation,is associated with nuclear energy proliferation,,because we know for example,,India and Pakistan developed nuclear weapons secretly,by enriching uranium,in nuclear energy facilities.,North Korea did that to some extent.,Iran is doing that right now.,And Venezuela would be doing it,if they started with their nuclear energy facilities.,If you do a large scale expansion,of nuclear energy across the world,,and as a result there was just one,nuclear bomb created,that was used to destroy a city,such as Mumbai or some other big city, megacity,,the additional death rates due to this,averaged over 30 years and then scaled to the population of the U.S.,would be this.,So, do we need this? 
 The next thing is: What about the footprint? Stewart mentioned the footprint.,Actually, the footprint on the ground for wind,is by far the smallest of any energy source in the world.,That, because the footprint, as you can see,,is just the pole touching the ground.,And you can power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet,with 73,000 to 145,000,five-megawatt wind turbines.,That would take between one and three square kilometers,of footprint on the ground, entirely.,The spacing is something else.,That's the footprint that is always being confused.,People confuse footprint with spacing.,As you can see from these pictures,,the spacing between can be used for multiple purposes,including agricultural land,,range land or open space.,Over the ocean, it's not even land.,Now if we look at nuclear -- (Laughter),With nuclear, what do we have?,We have facilities around there. You also have a buffer zone,that's 17 square kilometers.,And you have the uranium mining,that you have to deal with. 
 Now if we go to the area,,lots is worse than nuclear or wind.,For example, cellulosic ethanol, to power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet,,this is how much land you would need.,That's cellulosic, second generation,biofuels from prairie grass.,Here's corn ethanol. It's smaller.,This is based on ranges from data,,but if you look at nuclear,,it would be the size of Rhode Island to power the U.S. vehicle fleet.,For wind, there's a larger area,,but much smaller footprint.,And of course, with wind,,you could put it all over the East Coast,,offshore theoretically, or you can split it up.,And now, if you go back to,looking at geothermal, it's even smaller than both,,and solar is slightly larger than the nuclear spacing,,but it's still pretty small.,And this is to power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet.,To power the entire world with 50 percent wind,,you would need about one percent of world land. 
 Matching the reliability, base load is actually irrelevant.,We want to match the hour-by-hour power supply.,You can do that by combining renewables.,This is from real data in California,,looking at wind data and solar data.,And it considers just using existing hydro,to match the hour-by-hour power demand.,Here are the world wind resources.,There's five to 10 times more wind available worldwide,than we need for all the world.,So then here's the final ranking.,And one last slide I just want to show. This is the choice:,You can either have wind or nuclear.,If you use wind,,you guarantee ice will last.,Nuclear, the time lag alone,will allow the Arctic to melt and other places to melt more.,And we can guarantee a clean, blue sky,or an uncertain future with nuclear power. 
 (Applause) 
 CA: All right.,So while they're having their comebacks on each other --,and yours is slightly short because you slightly overran --,I need two people from either side.,So if you're for this,,if you're for nuclear power, put up two hands.,If you're against, put up one.,And I want two of each for the mics.,Now then, you guys have --,you have a minute comeback on him,to pick up a point he said, challenge it,,whatever. 
 SB: I think a point of difference we're having, Mark,,has to do with weapons,and energy.,These diagrams that show that nuclear is somehow,putting out a lot of greenhouse gases --,a lot of those studies include, "Well of course war will be inevitable,and therefore we'll have cities burning and stuff like that,",which is kind of finessing it,a little bit, I think.,The reality is that there's, what,,21 nations that have nuclear power?,Of those, seven have nuclear weapons.,In every case, they got the weapons,before they got the nuclear power.,There are two nations, North Korea and Israel,,that have nuclear weapons,and don't have nuclear power at all.,The places that we would most like to have,really clean energy occur,are China, India, Europe, North America,,all of which have sorted out their situation,in relation to nuclear weapons.,So that leaves a couple of places like Iran,,maybe Venezuela,,that you would like to have very close,surveillance of anything,that goes on with fissile stuff.,Pushing ahead with nuclear power will mean we,really know where all of the fissile material is,,and we can move toward,zero weapons left, once we know all that. 
 CA: Mark,,30 seconds, either on that or on anything Stewart said. 
 MJ: Well we know India and Pakistan had nuclear energy first,,and then they developed nuclear weapons secretly in the factories.,So the other thing is, we don't need nuclear energy.,There's plenty of solar and wind.,You can make it reliable, as I showed with that diagram.,That's from real data.,And this is an ongoing research. This is not rocket science.,Solving the world's problems can be done,,if you really put your mind to it and use clean, renewable energy.,There's absolutely no need for nuclear power. 
 (Applause) 
 CA: We need someone for.,Rod Beckstrom: Thank you Chris. I'm Rod Beckstrom, CEO of ICANN.,I've been involved in global warming policy,since 1994,,when I joined the board of Environmental Defense Fund,that was one of the crafters of the Kyoto Protocol.,And I want to support Stewart Brand's position.,I've come around in the last 10 years.,I used to be against nuclear power.,I'm now supporting Stewart's position,,softly, from a risk-management standpoint,,agreeing that,the risks of overheating the planet,outweigh the risk of nuclear incident,,which certainly is possible and is a very real problem.,However, I think there may be a win-win solution here,where both parties can win this debate,,and that is, we face a situation,where it's carbon caps on this planet,or die.,And in the United States Senate,,we need bipartisan support --,only one or two votes are needed --,to move global warming through the Senate,,and this room can help.,So if we get that through, then Mark will solve these problems. Thanks Chris. 
 CA: Thank you Rod Beckstrom. Against. 
 David Fanton: Hi, I'm David Fanton. I just want to say a couple quick things.,The first is: be aware of the propaganda.,The propaganda from the industry,has been very, very strong.,And we have not had,the other side of the argument fully aired,so that people can draw their own conclusions.,Be very aware of the propaganda.,Secondly, think about this.,If we build all these nuclear power plants,,all that waste,is going to be on hundreds, if not thousands,,of trucks and trains,,moving through this country every day.,Tell me they're not going to have accidents.,Tell me that those accidents aren't going to,put material into the environment,that is poisonous for hundreds of thousands of years.,And then tell me that each and every one of those trucks and trains,isn't a potential terrorist target. 
 CA: Thank you.,For.,Anyone else for? Go. 
 Alex: Hi, I'm Alex. I just wanted to say,,I'm, first of all, renewable energy's biggest fan.,I've got solar PV on my roof.,I've got a hydro conversion,at a watermill that I own.,And I'm, you know, very much "pro" that kind of stuff.,However, there's a basic arithmetic problem here.,The capability of,the sun shining, the wind blowing and the rain falling,,simply isn't enough to add up.,So if we want to keep the lights on,,we actually need a solution,which is going to keep generating all of the time.,I campaigned against nuclear weapons in the '80s,,and I continue to do so now.,But we've got an opportunity,to recycle them into something more useful,that enables us to get energy all of the time.,And, ultimately, the arithmetic problem isn't going to go away.,We're not going to get enough energy from renewables alone.,We need a solution that generates all of the time.,If we're going to keep the lights on,,nuclear is that solution. 
 CA: Thank you.,Anyone else against? 
 Man: The last person who was in favor made the premise,that we don't have enough,alternative renewable resources.,And our "against" proponent up here,made it very clear that we actually do.,And so the fallacy,that we need this resource,and we can actually make it in a time frame,that is meaningful is not possible.,I will also add one other thing.,Ray Kurzweil and all the other talks --,we know that the stick is going up exponentially.,So you can't look at state-of-the-art technologies in renewables,and say, "That's all we have.",Because five years from now, it will blow you away,what we'll actually have as alternatives,to this horrible, disastrous nuclear power. 
 CA: Point well made. Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 So each of you has really just a couple sentences --,30 seconds each,to sum up.,Your final pitch, Stewart. 
 SB: I loved your "It all balances out" chart,that you had there.,It was a sunny day and a windy night.,And just now in England,they had a cold spell.,All of the wind in the entire country,shut down for a week.,None of those things were stirring.,And as usual, they had to buy nuclear power from France.,Two gigawatts comes through the Chunnel.,This keeps happening.,I used to worry about the 10,000 year factor.,And the fact is, we're going to use the nuclear waste we have for fuel,in the fourth generation of reactors that are coming along.,And especially the small reactors need to go forward.,I heard from Nathan Myhrvold -- and I think here's the action point --,it'll take an act of Congress,to make the Nuclear Regulatory Commission,start moving quickly on these small reactors,,which we need very much, here and in the world. 
 (Applause) 
 MJ: So we've analyzed the hour-by-hour,power demand and supply,,looking at solar, wind, using data for California.,And you can match that demand, hour-by-hour,,for the whole year almost.,Now, with regard to the resources,,we've developed the first wind map of the world,,from data alone, at 80 meters.,We know what the wind resources are. You can cover 15 percent.,Fifteen percent of the entire U.S.,has wind at fast enough speeds to be cost-competitive.,And there's much more solar than there is wind.,There's plenty of resource. You can make it reliable. 
 CA: Okay. So, thank you, Mark.,(Applause),So if you were in Palm Springs ...,(Laughter),(Applause),Shameless. Shameless. Shameless.,(Applause) 
 So, people of the TED community,,I put it to you that what the world needs now,is nuclear energy.,All those in favor, raise your hands.,(Shouts),And all those against.,Ooooh.,Now that is -- my take on that ...,Just put up ... Hands up, people who changed their minds during the debate,,who voted differently.,Those of you who changed your mind,in favor of "for",put your hands up.,Okay. So here's the read on it.,Both people won supporters,,but on my count,,the mood of the TED community shifted,from about 75 to 25,to about 65 to 35,in favor, in favor. 
 You both won. I congratulate both of you.,Thank you for that. 
 (Applause)"People do stupid things.,That's what spreads HIV.",This was a headline in a U.K. newspaper,,The Guardian, not that long ago.,I'm curious, show of hands, who agrees with it?,Well, one or two brave souls. 
 This is actually a direct quote from an epidemiologist,who's been in field of HIV for 15 years,,worked on four continents,,and you're looking at her. 
 And I am now going to argue,that this is only half true.,People do get HIV because they do stupid things,,but most of them are doing stupid things,for perfectly rational reasons.,Now, "rational" is the dominant paradigm,in public health,,and if you put your public health nerd glasses on,,you'll see that if we give people the information that they need,about what's good for them and what's bad for them,,if you give them the services,that they can use to act on that information,,and a little bit of motivation,,people will make rational decisions,and live long and healthy lives.,Wonderful. 
 That's slightly problematic for me because I work in HIV,,and although I'm sure you all know,that HIV is about poverty and gender inequality,,and if you were at TED '07,it's about coffee prices ...,Actually, HIV's about sex and drugs,,and if there are two things that make,human beings a little bit irrational,,they are erections and addiction. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, let's start with what's rational for an addict.,Now, I remember speaking to an Indonesian friend of mine, Frankie.,We were having lunch and he was telling me,about when he was in jail in Bali for a drug injection.,It was someone's birthday, and they had very kindly,smuggled some heroin into jail,,and he was very generously sharing it out,with all of his colleagues.,And so everyone lined up,,all the smackheads in a row,,and the guy whose birthday it was,filled up the fit,,and he went down and started injecting people.,So he injects the first guy,,and then he's wiping the needle on his shirt,,and he injects the next guy.,And Frankie says, "I'm number 22 in line,,and I can see the needle coming down towards me,,and there is blood all over the place.,It's getting blunter and blunter.,And a small part of my brain is thinking,,'That is so gross,and really dangerous,',but most of my brain is thinking,,'Please let there be some smack left,by the time it gets to me.,Please let there be some left.'",And then, telling me this story,,Frankie said,,"You know ... God,,drugs really make you stupid." 
 And, you know, you can't fault him for accuracy.,But, actually, Frankie, at that time,,was a heroin addict and he was in jail.,So his choice was either,to accept that dirty needle or not to get high.,And if there's one place you really want to get high,,it's when you're in jail. 
 But I'm a scientist,and I don't like to make data out of anecdotes,,so let's look at some data.,We talked to 600 drug addicts,in three cities in Indonesia,,and we said, "Well, do you know how you get HIV?","Oh yeah, by sharing needles.",I mean, nearly 100 percent. Yeah, by sharing needles.,And, "Do you know where you can get a clean needle,at a price you can afford to avoid that?","Oh yeah." Hundred percent.,"We're smackheads; we know where to get clean needles.","So are you carrying a needle?",We're actually interviewing people on the street,,in the places where they're hanging out and taking drugs.,"Are you carrying clean needles?",One in four, maximum.,So no surprises then that,the proportion that actually used clean needles,every time they injected in the last week,is just about one in 10,,and the other nine in 10 are sharing. 
 So you've got this massive mismatch;,everyone knows that,if they share they're going to get HIV,,but they're all sharing anyway.,So what's that about? Is it like you get a better high if you share or something?,We asked that to a junkie and they're like, "Are you nuts?",You don't want to share a needle anymore than you want,to share a toothbrush even with someone you're sleeping with.,There's just kind of an ick factor there.,"No, no. We share needles because we don't want to go to jail.",So, in Indonesia at this time,,if you were carrying a needle and the cops rounded you up,,they could put you into jail.,And that changes the equation slightly, doesn't it?,Because your choice now is either,I use my own needle now,,or I could share a needle now,and get a disease that's going to,possibly kill me 10 years from now,,or I could use my own needle now,and go to jail tomorrow.,And while junkies think that,it's a really bad idea to expose themselves to HIV,,they think it's a much worse idea,to spend the next year in jail,where they'll probably end up in Frankie's situation,and expose themselves to HIV anyway.,So, suddenly it becomes perfectly rational,to share needles. 
 Now, let's look at it from a policy maker's point of view.,This is a really easy problem.,For once, your incentives are aligned.,We've got what's rational for public health.,You want people to use clean needles --,and junkies want to use clean needles.,So we could make this problem go away,simply by making clean needles universally available,and taking away the fear of arrest.,Now, the first person to figure that out,and do something about it on a national scale,was that well-known, bleeding heart liberal,Margaret Thatcher.,And she put in the world's first,national needle exchange program,,and other countries followed suit: Australia, The Netherlands and few others.,And in all of those countries, you can see,,not more than four percent of injectors,ever became infected with HIV. 
 Now, places that didn't do this -- New York City for example,,Moscow, Jakarta --,we're talking, at its peak,,one in two injectors,infected with this fatal disease.,Now, Margaret Thatcher didn't do this,because she has any great love for junkies.,She did it because she ran a country,that had a national health service.,So, if she didn't invest in effective prevention,,she was going to have pick up the costs,of treatment later on,,and obviously those are much higher.,So she was making a politically rational decision.,Now, if I take out my,public health nerd glasses here,and look at these data,,it seems like a no-brainer, doesn't it?,But in this country,,where the government apparently does not feel compelled,to provide health care for citizens, (Laughter),we've taken a very different approach.,So what we've been doing in the United States,is reviewing the data -- endlessly reviewing the data.,So, these are reviews of hundreds of studies,by all the big muckety-mucks,of the scientific pantheon in the United States,,and these are the studies that show,needle programs are effective -- quite a lot of them.,Now, the ones that show that needle programs aren't effective --,you think that's one of these annoying dynamic slides,and I'm going to press my dongle and the rest of it's going to come up,,but no -- that's the whole slide. 
 (Laughter) 
 There is nothing on the other side.,So, completely irrational,,you would think.,Except that, wait a minute, politicians are rational, too,,and they're responding to what they think the voters want.,So what we see is that voters respond,very well to things like this,and not quite so well to things like this. 
 (Laughter) 
 So it becomes quite rational,to deny services to injectors.,Now let's talk about sex.,Are we any more rational about sex?,Well, I'm not even going to address,the clearly irrational positions,of people like the Catholic Church,,who think somehow that if you give out condoms,,everyone's going to run out and have sex.,I don't know if Pope Benedict,watches TEDTalks online,,but if you do, I've got news for you Benedict --,I carry condoms all the time,and I never get laid.,(Laughter) (Applause),It's not that easy!,Here, maybe you'll have better luck. 
 (Applause) 
 Okay, seriously,,HIV is actually not that easy,to transmit sexually.,So, it depends on how much virus there is,in your blood and in your body fluids.,And what we've got is a very, very high level of virus,right at the beginning when you're first infected,,then you start making antibodies,,and then it bumps along at quite low levels,for a long time -- 10 or 12 years --,you have spikes if you get another sexually transmitted infection.,But basically, nothing much is going on,until you start to get symptomatic AIDS,,and by that stage,,you're not looking great, you're not feeling great,,you're not having that much sex. 
 So the sexual transmission of HIV,is essentially determined by how many partners you have,in these very short spaces of time,when you have peak viremia.,Now, this makes people crazy,because it means that you have to talk about,some groups having more sexual partners,in shorter spaces of time than other groups,,and that's considered stigmatizing.,I've always been a bit curious about that,because I think stigma is a bad thing,,whereas lots of sex is quite a good thing,,but we'll leave that be.,The truth is that 20 years,of very good research,have shown us that,there are groups that are more likely to turnover,large numbers of partners in a short space of time.,And those groups are, globally,,people who sell sex and their more regular partners.,They are gay men on the party scene,who have, on average, three times more partners,than straight people on the party scene.,And they are heterosexuals,who come from countries that have,traditions of polygamy,and relatively high levels of female autonomy,,and almost all of those countries are in east or southern Africa.,And that is reflected in the epidemic that we have today. 
 You can see these horrifying figures from Africa.,These are all countries in southern Africa,where between one in seven,,and one in three,of all adults,,are infected with HIV.,Now, in the rest of the world,,we've got basically nothing going on in the general population --,very, very low levels --,but we have extraordinarily high levels of HIV,in these other populations who are at highest risk:,drug injectors, sex workers,and gay men.,And you'll note, that's the local data from Los Angeles:,25 percent prevalence among gay men.,Of course, you can't get HIV just by having unprotected sex.,You can only HIV by having unprotected sex,with a positive person. 
 In most of the world,,these few prevention failures,notwithstanding,,we are actually doing quite well these days,in commercial sex:,condom use rates are between 80 and 100 percent,in commercial sex in most countries.,And, again, it's because of an alignment of the incentives.,What's rational for public health,is also rational for individual sex workers,because it's really bad for business to have another STI.,No one wants it.,And, actually, clients don't want to go home with a drip either.,So essentially, you're able to achieve,quite high rates of condom use in commercial sex. 
 But in "intimate" relations,it's much more difficult because,,with your wife or your boyfriend,or someone that you hope might turn into one of those things,,we have this illusion of romance,and trust and intimacy,,and nothing is quite so unromantic,as the, "My condom or yours, darling?" question.,So in the face of that,,you really need quite a strong incentive,to use condoms. 
 This, for example, this gentleman is called Joseph.,He's from Haiti and he has AIDS.,And he's probably not having a lot of sex right now,,but he is a reminder in the population,,of why you might want to be,using condoms.,This is also in Haiti and is a reminder,of why you might want to be having sex, perhaps.,Now, funnily enough, this is also Joseph,after six months on antiretroviral treatment.,Not for nothing do we call it the Lazarus Effect.,But it is changing the equation,of what's rational,in sexual decision-making.,So, what we've got --,some people say, "Oh, it doesn't matter very much,because, actually, treatment is effective prevention,because it lowers your viral load and therefore,makes it more difficult to transmit HIV.",So, if you look at the viremia thing again,,if you do start treatment when you're sick,,well, what happens? Your viral load comes down.,But compared to what? What happens if you're not on treatment?,Well, you die,,so your viral load goes to zero.,And all of this green stuff here, including the spikes --,which are because you couldn't get to the pharmacy,,or you ran out of drugs, or you went on a three day party binge,and forgot to take your drugs,,or because you've started to get resistance, or whatever --,all of that is virus,that wouldn't be out there, except for treatment. 
 Now, am I saying, "Oh, well, great prevention strategy.,Let's just stop treating people.",Of course not, of course not.,We need to expand antiretroviral treatment as much as we can.,But what I am doing is calling into question,those people who say that more treatment,is all the prevention we need.,That's simply not necessarily true,,and I think we can learn a lot from the experience of gay men,in rich countries where treatment has been widely available,for going on 15 years now.,And what we've seen is,that, actually, condom use rates,,which were very, very high --,the gay community responded very rapidly to HIV,,with extremely little help,from public health nerds, I would say --,that condom use rate has come down dramatically since treatment,for two reasons really:,One is the assumption of, "Oh well,,if he's infected, he's probably on meds,,and his viral load's going to be low, so I'm pretty safe." 
 And the other thing is that people are simply,not as scared of HIV,as they were of AIDS, and rightly so.,AIDS was a disfiguring disease that killed you,,and HIV is an invisible virus,that makes you take a pill every day.,And that's boring,,but is it as boring as,having to use a condom every time you have sex,,no matter how drunk you are,,no matter how many poppers you've taken, whatever?,If we look at the data, we can see that,the answer to that question,is, mmm. 
 So these are data from Scotland.,You see the peak in drug injectors,before they started the national needle exchange program.,Then it came way down.,And both in heterosexuals -- mostly in commercial sex --,and in drug users,,you've really got nothing much going on after treatment begins,,and that's because of that alignment of incentives,that I talked about earlier.,But in gay men,,you've got quite a dramatic rise,starting three or four years,after treatment became widely available.,This is of new infections. 
 What does that mean?,It means that the combined effect of being less worried,and having more virus out there in the population --,more people living longer, healthier lives,,more likely to be getting laid,with HIV --,is outweighing the effects of lower viral load,,and that's a very worrisome thing.,What does it mean?,It means we need to be doing more prevention the more treatment we have. 
 Is that what's happening?,No, and I call it the "compassion conundrum.",We've talked a lot about compassion the last couple of days,,and what's happening really is that people are,unable quite to bring themselves to put in,good sexual and reproductive health services for sex workers,,unable quite to be giving out needles to junkies.,But once they've gone from being,transgressive people whose behaviors we don't want to condone,to being AIDS victims,,we come over all compassionate,and buy them incredibly expensive drugs for the rest of their lives.,It doesn't make any sense,from a public health point of view. 
 I want to give what's very nearly the last word to Ines.,Ines is a a transgender hooker on the streets of Jakarta;,she's a chick with a dick.,Why does she do that job?,Well, of course, because she's forced into it,because she doesn't have any better option, etc., etc.,And if we could just teach her to sew,and get her a nice job in a factory, all would be well.,This is what factory workers earn in an hour in Indonesia:,on average, 20 cents.,It varies a bit province to province.,I do speak to sex workers, 15,000 of them,for this particular slide,,and this is what sex workers,say they earn in an hour.,So it's not a great job, but for a lot of people,it really is quite a rational choice.,Okay, Ines. 
 We've got the tools, the knowledge and the cash,,and commitment to preventing HIV too. 
 Ines: So why is prevalence still rising?,It's all politics.,When you get to politics, nothing makes sense. 
 Elizabeth Pisani: "When you get to politics, nothing makes sense.",So, from the point of view of a sex worker,,politicians are making no sense.,From the point of view of a public health nerd,,junkies are doing dumb things.,The truth is that everyone has a different rationale.,There are as many different ways of being rational,as there are human beings on the planet,,and that's one of the glories of human existence.,But those ways of being rational,are not independent of one another,,so it's rational for,a drug injector to share needles,because of a stupid decision that's made by a politician,,and it's rational for a politician,to make that stupid decision,because they're responding to,what they think the voters want.,But here's the thing:,we are the voters.,We're not all of them, of course, but TED is a community of opinion leaders.,And everyone who's in this room,,and everyone who's watching this out there on the web,,I think, has a duty to demand of their politicians,that we make policy based on scientific evidence,and on common sense.,It's going to be really hard for us,to individually affect what's rational,for every Frankie and every Ines out there,,but you can at least use your vote,to stop politicians doing stupid things,that spread HIV. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So here it is. You can check: I am short, I'm French,,I have a pretty strong French accent,,so that's going to be clear in a moment. 
 Maybe a sobering thought,and something you all know about.,And I suspect many of you gave,something to the people of Haiti this year.,And there is something else,I believe in the back of your mind,you also know.,That is, every day,,25,000 children die,of entirely preventable causes.,That's a Haiti earthquake every eight days.,And I suspect many of you probably gave something,towards that problem as well,,but somehow it doesn't happen,with the same intensity. 
 So why is that?,Well, here is a thought experiment for you.,Imagine you have a few million dollars that you've raised --,maybe you're a politician in a developing country,and you have a budget to spend. You want to spend it on the poor:,How do you go about it?,Do you believe the people who tell you,that all we need to do is to spend money?,That we know how to eradicate poverty,,we just need to do more?,Or do you believe the people who tell you that,aid is not going to help, on the contrary it might hurt,,it might exacerbate corruption, dependence, etc.?,Or maybe you turn to the past.,After all, we have spent billions of dollars on aid.,Maybe you look at the past and see.,Has it done any good? 
 And, sadly, we don't know.,And worst of all, we will never know.,And the reason is that -- take Africa for example.,Africans have already got a lot of aid.,These are the blue bars.,And the GDP in Africa is not making much progress.,Okay, fine. How do you know what,would have happened without the aid?,Maybe it would have been much worse,,or maybe it would have been better.,We have no idea. We don't know what the counterfactual is.,There's only one Africa. 
 So what do you do?,To give the aid, and hope and pray that something comes out of it?,Or do you focus on your everyday life,and let the earthquake every eight days,continue to happen?,The thing is, if we don't know,whether we are doing any good,,we are not any better,than the Medieval doctors and their leeches.,Sometimes the patient gets better, sometimes the patient dies.,Is it the leeches? Is it something else?,We don't know. 
 So here are some other questions.,They're smaller questions,,but they are not that small.,Immunization, that's the cheapest way,to save a child's life.,And the world has spent a lot of money on it:,The GAVI and the Gates Foundations,are each pledging a lot of money towards it,,and developing countries themselves have been doing a lot of effort.,And yet, every year,at least 25 million children,do not get the immunization they should get.,So this is what you call a "last mile problem.",The technology is there,,the infrastructure is there,,and yet it doesn't happen.,So you have your million.,How do you use your million,to solve this last mile problem? 
 And here's another question:,Malaria. Malaria kills almost,900,000 people every year,,most of them in Sub-Saharan Africa,,most of them under five.,In fact, that is the leading cause of under-five mortality.,We already know how to kill malaria,,but some people come to you and say,,"You have your millions. How about bed nets?",Bed nets are very cheap.,For 10 dollars, you can manufacture and ship,an insecticide treated bed net,and you can teach someone to use them.,And, not only do they protect the people who sleep under them,,but they have these great contagion benefits.,If half of a community sleeps under a net,,the other half also benefits,because the contagion of the disease spread.,And yet, only a quarter of kids at risk sleep under a net.,Societies should be willing to go out,and subsidize the net, give them for free,,or, for that matter, pay people to use them,because of those contagion benefits.,"Not so fast," say other people.,"If you give the nets for free,,people are not going to value them.,They're not going to use them,,or at least they're not going to use them as bed nets,,maybe as fishing nets.",So, what do you do?,Do you give the nets for free to maximize coverage,,or do you make people pay,in order to make sure that they really value them?,How do you know? 
 And a third question: Education.,Maybe that's the solution, maybe we should send kids to school.,But how do you do that?,Do you hire teachers? Do you build more schools?,Do you provide school lunch?,How do you know? 
 So here is the thing.,I cannot answer the big question,,whether aid did any good or not.,But these three questions, I can answer them.,It's not the Middle Ages anymore,,it's the 21st century.,And in the 20th century,,randomized, controlled trials,have revolutionized medicine,by allowing us to distinguish,between drugs that work,and drugs that don't work.,And you can do the same,randomized, controlled trial for social policy.,You can put social innovation to the same,rigorous, scientific tests,that we use for drugs.,And in this way, you can take the guesswork,out of policy-making,by knowing what works,,what doesn't work and why.,And I'll give you some examples with those three questions. 
 So I start with immunization.,Here's Udaipur District, Rajasthan. Beautiful.,Well, when I started working there,,about one percent of children,were fully immunized.,That's bad, but there are places like that.,Now, it's not because the vaccines are not there --,they are there and they are free --,and it's not because parents do not care about their kids.,The same child that is not immunized against measles,,if they do get measles, parents will spend,thousands of rupees to help them.,So you get these empty village subcenters,and crowded hospitals.,So what is the problem?,Well, part of the problem, surely, is people do not fully understand.,After all, in this country as well,,all sorts of myths and misconceptions,go around immunization.,So if that's the case, that's difficult,,because persuasion is really difficult.,But maybe there is another problem as well.,It's going from intention to action.,Imagine you are a mother,in Udaipur District, Rajasthan.,You have to walk a few kilometers to get your kids immunized.,And maybe when you get there, what you find is this:,The subcenter is closed. Ao you have to come back,,and you are so busy and you have so many other things to do,,you will always tend to postpone and postpone,,and eventually it gets too late.,Well, if that's the problem, then that's much easier.,Because A, we can make it easy,,and B, we can maybe,give people a reason to act today,,rather than wait till tomorrow. 
 So these are simple ideas, but we didn't know.,So let's try them.,So what we did is we did a randomized, controlled trial,in 134 villages in Udaipur Districts.,So the blue dots,are selected randomly.,We made it easy -- I'll tell you how in a moment.,In the red dots, we made it easy,and gave people a reason to act now.,The white dots are comparisons, nothing changed.,So we make it easy by organizing,this monthly camp where people can,get their kids immunized.,And then you make it easy,and give a reason to act now,by adding a kilo of lentils for each immunization.,Now, a kilo of lentils is tiny.,It's never going to convince anybody,to do something that they don't want to do.,On the other hand, if your problem is you tend to postpone,,then it might give you a reason to act today,rather than later. 
 So what do we find?,Well, beforehand, everything is the same.,That's the beauty of randomization.,Afterwards,,the camp -- just having the camp --,increases immunization from six percent to 17 percent.,That's full immunization.,That's not bad, that's a good improvement.,Add the lentils and you reach to 38 percent.,So here you've got your answer.,Make it easy and give a kilo of lentils,,you multiply immunization rate by six.,Now, you might say, "Well, but it's not sustainable.,We cannot keep giving lentils to people.",Well, it turns out it's wrong economics,,because it is cheaper,to give lentils than not to give them.,Since you have to pay for the nurse anyway,,the cost per immunization,ends up being cheaper if you give incentives than if you don't. 
 How about bed nets?,Should you give them for free, or should you ask people to pay for them?,So the answer hinges,on the answer to three simple questions.,One is: If people must pay for a bed net,,are they going to purchase them?,The second one is:,If I give bed nets for free,,are people going to use them?,And the third one is:,Do free bed nets discourage future purchase?,The third one is important,because if we think people get used to handouts,,it might destroy markets to distribute free bed nets.,Now this is a debate that has generated,a lot of emotion and angry rhetoric.,It's more ideological than practical,,but it turns out it's an easy question.,We can know the answer to this question.,We can just run an experiment.,And many experiments have been run, and they all have the same results,,so I'm just going to talk to you about one. 
 And this one that was in Kenya,,they went around and distributed to people,vouchers, discount vouchers.,So people with their voucher,could get the bed net in the local pharmacy.,And some people get 100 percent discount,,and some people get 20 percent discounts,,and some people get 50 percent discount, etc.,And now we can see what happens.,So, how about the purchasing?,Well, what you can see is that,when people have to pay for their bed nets,,the coverage rate really falls down a lot.,So even with partial subsidy,,three dollars is still not the full cost of a bed net,,and now you only have 20 percent of the people with the bed nets,,you lose the health immunity, that's not great.,Second thing is, how about the use?,Well, the good news is, people, if they have the bed nets,,will use the bed nets regardless of how they got it.,If they get it for free, they use it.,If they have to pay for it, they use it.,How about the long term?,In the long term,,people who got the free bed nets,,one year later, were offered the option,to purchase a bed net at two dollars.,And people who got the free one,were actually more likely to purchase the second one,than people who didn't get a free one.,So people do not get used to handouts; they get used to nets.,Maybe we need to give them a little bit more credit. 
 So, that's for bed nets. So you will think, "That's great.,You know how to immunize kids, you know how to give bed nets.",But what politicians need is a range of options.,They need to know: Out of all the things I could do,,what is the best way to achieve my goals?,So suppose your goal is to get kids into school.,There are so many things you could do. You could pay for uniforms,,you could eliminate fees, you could build latrines,,you could give girls sanitary pads, etc., etc.,So what's the best?,Well, at some level, we think,all of these things should work.,So, is that sufficient? If we think they should work intuitively,,should we go for them?,Well, in business, that's certainly not the way we would go about it. 
 Consider for example,transporting goods.,Before the canals were invented,in Britain before the Industrial Revolution,,goods used to go on horse carts.,And then canals were built,,and with the same horseman and the same horse,,you could carry ten times as much cargo.,So should they have continued,to carry the goods on the horse carts, on the ground,,that they would eventually get there?,Well, if that had been the case,,there would have been no Industrial Revolution.,So why shouldn't we do the same with social policy?,In technology, we spend so much time,experimenting, fine-tuning,,getting the absolute cheapest way to do something,,so why aren't we doing that with social policy? 
 Well, with experiments, what you can do,is answer a simple question.,Suppose you have 100 dollars to spend,on various interventions.,How many extra years of education,do you get for your hundred dollars?,Now I'm going to show you,what we get with various education interventions.,So the first ones are if you want the usual suspects,,hire teachers, school meals,,school uniforms, scholarships.,And that's not bad. For your hundred dollars,,you get between one and three extra years of education.,Things that don't work so well is bribing parents,,just because so many kids are already going to school,that you end up spending a lot of money.,And here are the most surprising results.,Tell people the benefits of education,,that's very cheap to do.,So for every hundred dollars you spend doing that,,you get 40 extra years of education.,And, in places where there are worms,,intestinal worms,,cure the kids of their worms.,And for every hundred dollars,,you get almost 30 extra years of education.,So this is not your intuition,,this is not what people would have gone for,,and yet, these are the programs that work.,We need that kind of information, we need more of it,,and then we need to guide policy. 
 So now, I started from the big problem, and I couldn't answer it.,And I cut it into smaller questions,,and I have the answer to these smaller questions.,And they are good, scientific, robust answers. 
 So let's go back to Haiti for a moment.,In Haiti, about 200,000 people died --,actually, a bit more by the latest estimate.,And the response of the world was great:,Two billion dollars got pledged just last month,,so that's about 10,000 dollars per death.,That doesn't sound like that much when you think about it.,But if we were willing to spend 10,000 dollars,for every child under five who dies,,that would be 90 billion per year,just for that problem.,And yet it doesn't happen.,So, why is that?,Well, I think what part of the problem is that,,in Haiti, although the problem is huge,,somehow we understand it, it's localized.,You give your money to Doctors Without Borders,,you give your money to Partners In Health,,and they'll send in the doctors, and they'll send in the lumber,,and they'll helicopter things out and in.,And the problem of poverty is not like that.,So, first, it's mostly invisible;,second, it's huge;,and third, we don't know whether we are doing the right thing.,There's no silver bullet.,You cannot helicopter people out of poverty.,And that's very frustrating. 
 But look what we just did today.,I gave you three simple answers to three questions:,Give lentils to immunize people,,provide free bed nets, deworm children.,With immunization or bed nets,,you can save a life for 300 dollars per life saved.,With deworming, you can get,an extra year of education for three dollars.,So we cannot eradicate poverty just yet,,but we can get started.,And maybe we can get started small,with things that we know are effective. 
 Here's an example of how this can be powerful.,Deworming.,Worms have a little bit of a problem grabbing the headlines.,They are not beautiful and don't kill anybody.,And yet, when the young global leader in Davos,showed the numbers I gave you,,they started Deworm the World.,And thanks to Deworm the World,,and the effort of many country governments and foundations,,20 million school-aged children got dewormed in 2009.,So this evidence is powerful.,It can prompt action. 
 So we should get started now.,It's not going to be easy.,It's a very slow process.,You have to keep experimenting, and sometimes ideology,has to be trumped by practicality.,And sometimes what works somewhere doesn't work elsewhere.,So it's a slow process,,but there is no other way.,These economics I'm proposing,,it's like 20th century medicine.,It's a slow, deliberative process,of discovery.,There is no miracle cure,,but modern medicine is saving,millions of lives every year,,and we can do the same thing. 
 And now, maybe, we can go back to the bigger question,that I started with at the beginning.,I cannot tell you,whether the aid we have spent in the past has made a difference,,but can we come back here in 30 years,and say, "What we have done,,it really prompted a change for the better.",I believe we can and I hope we will. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So, these are,the Dark Ages.,And the Dark Ages are the time between,when you put away the Lego,for the last time as a kid,,and you decide as an adult that it is okay to play with a kid's toy.,Started out with my then four-year-old:,"Oh, should buy the kid some Lego.,That stuff's cool.",Walked into the Lego store.,Bought him this.,It's totally appropriate for a four-year-old.,(Laughter),I think the box says --,let's see here --,"8 to 12" on it.,I turn to my wife and said, "Who are we buying this for?",She's like, "Oh, us." I'm like, "Okay. All right. That's cool." 
 Pretty soon it got a little bit out of control.,The dining room looked like this.,You walk there, and it hurts.,So we took a room downstairs in the basement,that had been used as sort of an Abu Ghraib annex.,(Laughter),Torture, very funny.,Wow, you guys are great.,And we put down those little floor tiles,,and then I went onto eBay,and bought 150 pounds of Lego --,(Laughter),which is insane.,My daughter -- the day we got it, I was tucking her in --,and I said,,"Honey, you're my treasure.",And she said, "No, the Lego is the treasure.",(Laughter),And then she said, "Dad, we're Lego rich.",I was like, "Yeah.,I suppose we are.",So then once you do that,you're like, "Oh, crap. Where am I going to put all this?",So you go to The Container Store,and spend an enormous amount of money,,and then you start this crazy sorting process,that never --,it's just nuts.,Whatever. 
 So then you realize there are these conventions.,And you go to one of these conventions, and some dude built the Titanic.,And you're like, "Holy shit!,He had to come in like a truck,,a semi, with this thing.",And then someone built this -- this is the Smith Tower in Seattle.,Just beautiful.,And there's a dude selling these,aftermarket weapons for Lego,,because Lego -- the Danish --,no, they're not into guns.,But the Americans? Oh, we'll make some guns for Lego, no problem.,And at a certain point, you look around,,you're like, "Whoa, this is a really nerdy crowd.",And I mean like this is a nerdy crowd,,but that's like a couple of levels above furries.,(Laughter),The nerds here, they get laid --,except for the lady with the condoms in her pocket --,and you say to yourself at some point,,"Am I part of this group? Like, am I into this?",And I was just like, "Yeah, I guess I am.,I'm coming out.,I'm kind of into this stuff, and I'm going to stop being embarrassed." 
 So then you really get into it,,and you're like, "Well, the Lego people in Denmark, they've got all this software,to let you build your own virtually.",And so this is like this CAD program where you build it.,And then whatever you design virtually,,you click the button and it shows up at your doorstep a week later.,And then some of the designs that people do,they actually sell in the store.,The Lego guys don't give you any royalties, strangely,,but some user made this and then it sold.,And it's pretty amazing actually. 
 Then you notice that if that,Lego-provided CAD program isn't enough,,there's an entire open-source, third-party,,independent Lego CAD program,that lets you do 3D modeling,and 3D rendering,and make, in fact, movies out of Lego,,3D films,of which there are thousands on YouTube,,and some of them sort of mimicking famous films,and some totally original content --,just beautiful --,and people recreating all sorts of things.,I have to take a moment.,I love the guy who's like running away,with his clasps, his hooks.,Okay. Anyway. 
 (Laughter) 
 There's a whole programming language and robotics tool,,so if you want to teach someone how to program,,kid, adult, whatever it is.,And the guy that made this,,he made a slot machine out of Lego.,And I don't mean he made Lego that looked like a slot machine;,I mean he made a slot machine out of Lego.,The insides were Lego. 
 There's people getting drunk building Lego,,and you've got to finish the thing before you puke.,There's a whole gray market for Lego,,thousands of home-based businesses.,And some people will fund their entire Lego habit,by selling the little guy,,but then you have no guys in your ships. 
 And then, just some examples. This stuff really is sculpture.,This is amazing what you can do.,And don't kid yourself:,some architectural details, incredible organic shapes,and just, even, nature out of, again, little blocks.,This is my house.,And this is my house.,I was afraid a car was going to come smash it,as I was taking a picture for you guys. 
 Anyway, I'm out of time.,But just very quickly --,we'll just see if I can do this quick.,Because there aren't enough TED logos around here.,(Laughter),Let's see here.,Okay.,Ta-da. 
 (Applause)I grew up on a steady diet of science fiction.,In high school, I took a bus to school,an hour each way every day.,And I was always absorbed in a book,,science fiction book,,which took my mind to other worlds,,and satisfied, in a narrative form,,this insatiable sense of curiosity that I had. 
 And you know, that curiosity also manifested itself,in the fact that whenever I wasn't in school,I was out in the woods,,hiking and taking "samples" --,frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water --,and bringing it back, looking at it under the microscope.,You know, I was a real science geek.,But it was all about trying to understand the world,,understand the limits of possibility. 
 And my love of science fiction,actually seemed mirrored in the world around me,,because what was happening, this was in the late '60s,,we were going to the moon,,we were exploring the deep oceans.,Jacques Cousteau was coming into our living rooms,with his amazing specials that showed us,animals and places and a wondrous world,that we could never really have previously imagined.,So, that seemed to resonate,with the whole science fiction part of it. 
 And I was an artist.,I could draw. I could paint.,And I found that because there weren't video games,and this saturation of CG movies and all of this,imagery in the media landscape,,I had to create these images in my head.,You know, we all did, as kids having to,read a book, and through the author's description,,put something on the movie screen in our heads.,And so, my response to this was to paint, to draw,alien creatures, alien worlds,,robots, spaceships, all that stuff.,I was endlessly getting busted in math class,doodling behind the textbook.,That was -- the creativity,had to find its outlet somehow. 
 And an interesting thing happened: The Jacques Cousteau shows,actually got me very excited about the fact that there was,an alien world right here on Earth.,I might not really go to an alien world,on a spaceship someday --,that seemed pretty darn unlikely.,But that was a world I could really go to,,right here on Earth, that was as rich and exotic,as anything that I had imagined,from reading these books. 
 So, I decided I was going to become a scuba diver,at the age of 15.,And the only problem with that was that I lived,in a little village in Canada,,600 miles from the nearest ocean.,But I didn't let that daunt me.,I pestered my father until he finally found,a scuba class in Buffalo, New York,,right across the border from where we live.,And I actually got certified,in a pool at a YMCA in the dead of winter,in Buffalo, New York.,And I didn't see the ocean, a real ocean,,for another two years,,until we moved to California. 
 Since then, in the intervening,40 years,,I've spent about 3,000 hours underwater,,and 500 hours of that was in submersibles.,And I've learned that that deep-ocean environment,,and even the shallow oceans,,are so rich with amazing life,that really is beyond our imagination.,Nature's imagination is so boundless,compared to our own,meager human imagination.,I still, to this day, stand in absolute awe,of what I see when I make these dives.,And my love affair with the ocean is ongoing,,and just as strong as it ever was. 
 But when I chose a career as an adult,,it was filmmaking.,And that seemed to be the best way to reconcile,this urge I had to tell stories,with my urges to create images.,And I was, as a kid, constantly drawing comic books, and so on.,So, filmmaking was the way to put pictures and stories,together, and that made sense.,And of course the stories that I chose to tell,were science fiction stories: "Terminator," "Aliens",and "The Abyss.",And with "The Abyss," I was putting together my love,of underwater and diving with filmmaking.,So, you know, merging the two passions. 
 Something interesting came out of "The Abyss,",which was that to solve a specific narrative,problem on that film,,which was to create this kind of liquid water creature,,we actually embraced computer generated animation, CG.,And this resulted in the first soft-surface,character, CG animation,that was ever in a movie.,And even though the film didn't make any money --,barely broke even, I should say --,I witnessed something amazing, which is that the audience,,the global audience, was mesmerized,by this apparent magic. 
 You know, it's Arthur Clarke's law,that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.,They were seeing something magical.,And so that got me very excited.,And I thought, "Wow, this is something that needs to be embraced,into the cinematic art.",So, with "Terminator 2," which was my next film,,we took that much farther.,Working with ILM, we created the liquid metal dude,in that film. The success hung in the balance,on whether that effect would work.,And it did, and we created magic again,,and we had the same result with an audience --,although we did make a little more money on that one. 
 So, drawing a line through those two dots,of experience,came to, "This is going to be a whole new world,",this was a whole new world of creativity,for film artists.,So, I started a company with Stan Winston,,my good friend Stan Winston,,who is the premier make-up and creature designer,at that time, and it was called Digital Domain.,And the concept of the company was,that we would leapfrog past,the analog processes of optical printers and so on,,and we would go right to digital production.,And we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while. 
 But we found ourselves lagging in the mid '90s,in the creature and character design stuff,that we had actually founded the company to do.,So, I wrote this piece called "Avatar,",which was meant to absolutely push the envelope,of visual effects,,of CG effects, beyond,,with realistic human emotive characters,generated in CG,,and the main characters would all be in CG,,and the world would be in CG.,And the envelope pushed back,,and I was told by the folks at my company,that we weren't going to be able to do this for a while. 
 So, I shelved it, and I made this other movie about a big ship that sinks.,(Laughter),You know, I went and pitched it to the studio as "'Romeo and Juliet' on a ship:,"It's going to be this epic romance,,passionate film.",Secretly, what I wanted to do was,I wanted to dive to the real wreck of "Titanic.",And that's why I made the movie.,(Applause),And that's the truth. Now, the studio didn't know that.,But I convinced them. I said,,"We're going to dive to the wreck. We're going to film it for real.,We'll be using it in the opening of the film.,It will be really important. It will be a great marketing hook.",And I talked them into funding an expedition.,(Laughter) 
 Sounds crazy. But this goes back to that theme,about your imagination creating a reality.,Because we actually created a reality where six months later,,I find myself in a Russian submersible,two and a half miles down in the north Atlantic,,looking at the real Titanic through a view port.,Not a movie, not HD -- for real.,(Applause) 
 Now, that blew my mind.,And it took a lot of preparation, we had to build cameras,and lights and all kinds of things.,But, it struck me how much,this dive, these deep dives,,was like a space mission.,You know, where it was highly technical,,and it required enormous planning.,You get in this capsule, you go down to this dark,hostile environment,where there is no hope of rescue,if you can't get back by yourself.,And I thought like, "Wow. I'm like,,living in a science fiction movie.,This is really cool." 
 And so, I really got bitten by the bug of deep-ocean exploration.,Of course, the curiosity, the science component of it --,it was everything. It was adventure,,it was curiosity, it was imagination.,And it was an experience that,Hollywood couldn't give me.,Because, you know, I could imagine a creature and we could,create a visual effect for it. But I couldn't imagine what I was seeing,out that window.,As we did some of our subsequent expeditions,,I was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents,and sometimes things that I had never seen before,,sometimes things that no one had seen before,,that actually were not described by science,at the time that we saw them and imaged them. 
 So, I was completely smitten by this,,and had to do more.,And so, I actually made a kind of curious decision.,After the success of "Titanic,",I said, "OK, I'm going to park my day job,as a Hollywood movie maker,,and I'm going to go be a full-time explorer for a while.",And so, we started planning these,expeditions.,And we wound up going to the Bismark,,and exploring it with robotic vehicles.,We went back to the Titanic wreck.,We took little bots that we had created,that spooled a fiber optic.,And the idea was to go in and do an interior,survey of that ship, which had never been done.,Nobody had ever looked inside the wreck. They didn't have the means to do it,,so we created technology to do it. 
 So, you know, here I am now, on the deck,of Titanic, sitting in a submersible,,and looking out at planks that look much like this,,where I knew that the band had played.,And I'm flying a little robotic vehicle,through the corridor of the ship.,When I say, "I'm operating it,",but my mind is in the vehicle.,I felt like I was physically present,inside the shipwreck of Titanic.,And it was the most surreal kind,of deja vu experience I've ever had,,because I would know before I turned a corner,what was going to be there before the lights,of the vehicle actually revealed it,,because I had walked the set for months,when we were making the movie.,And the set was based as an exact replica,on the blueprints of the ship. 
 So, it was this absolutely remarkable experience.,And it really made me realize that,the telepresence experience --,that you actually can have these robotic avatars,,then your consciousness is injected into the vehicle,,into this other form of existence.,It was really, really quite profound.,And it may be a little bit of a glimpse as to what might be happening,some decades out,as we start to have cyborg bodies,for exploration or for other means,in many sort of,post-human futures,that I can imagine,,as a science fiction fan. 
 So, having done these expeditions,,and really beginning to appreciate what was down there,,such as at the deep ocean vents,where we had these amazing, amazing animals --,they're basically aliens right here on Earth.,They live in an environment of chemosynthesis.,They don't survive on sunlight-based,system the way we do.,And so, you're seeing animals that are living next to,a 500-degree-Centigrade,water plumes.,You think they can't possibly exist. 
 At the same time,I was getting very interested in space science as well --,again, it's the science fiction influence, as a kid.,And I wound up getting involved with,the space community,,really involved with NASA,,sitting on the NASA advisory board,,planning actual space missions,,going to Russia, going through the pre-cosmonaut,biomedical protocols,,and all these sorts of things,,to actually go and fly to the international space station,with our 3D camera systems.,And this was fascinating.,But what I wound up doing was bringing space scientists,with us into the deep.,And taking them down so that they had access --,astrobiologists, planetary scientists,,people who were interested in these extreme environments --,taking them down to the vents, and letting them see,,and take samples and test instruments, and so on. 
 So, here we were making documentary films,,but actually doing science,,and actually doing space science.,I'd completely closed the loop,between being the science fiction fan,,you know, as a kid,,and doing this stuff for real.,And you know, along the way in this journey,of discovery,,I learned a lot.,I learned a lot about science. But I also learned a lot,about leadership.,Now you think director has got to be a leader,,leader of, captain of the ship, and all that sort of thing. 
 I didn't really learn about leadership,until I did these expeditions.,Because I had to, at a certain point, say,,"What am I doing out here?,Why am I doing this? What do I get out of it?",We don't make money at these damn shows.,We barely break even. There is no fame in it.,People sort of think I went away,between "Titanic" and "Avatar" and was buffing my nails,someplace, sitting at the beach.,Made all these films, made all these documentary films,for a very limited audience. 
 No fame, no glory, no money. What are you doing?,You're doing it for the task itself,,for the challenge --,and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is --,for the thrill of discovery,,and for that strange bond that happens,when a small group of people form a tightly knit team.,Because we would do these things with 10, 12 people,,working for years at a time,,sometimes at sea for two, three months at a time. 
 And in that bond, you realize,that the most important thing,is the respect that you have for them,and that they have for you, that you've done a task,that you can't explain to someone else.,When you come back to the shore and you say,,"We had to do this, and the fiber optic, and the attentuation,,and the this and the that,,all the technology of it, and the difficulty,,the human-performance aspects of working at sea,",you can't explain it to people. It's that thing that,maybe cops have, or people in combat that have gone through something together,and they know they can never explain it.,Creates a bond, creates a bond of respect. 
 So, when I came back to make my next movie,,which was "Avatar,",I tried to apply that same principle of leadership,,which is that you respect your team,,and you earn their respect in return.,And it really changed the dynamic.,So, here I was again with a small team,,in uncharted territory,,doing "Avatar," coming up with new technology,that didn't exist before.,Tremendously exciting.,Tremendously challenging.,And we became a family, over a four-and-half year period.,And it completely changed how I do movies.,So, people have commented on how, "Well, you know,,you brought back the ocean organisms,and put them on the planet of Pandora.",To me, it was more of a fundamental way of doing business,,the process itself, that changed as a result of that. 
 So, what can we synthesize out of all this?,You know, what are the lessons learned?,Well, I think number one is,curiosity.,It's the most powerful thing you own.,Imagination is a force,that can actually manifest a reality.,And the respect of your team,is more important than all the,laurels in the world.,I have young filmmakers,come up to me and say, "Give me some advice for doing this.",And I say, "Don't put limitations on yourself.,Other people will do that for you -- don't do it to yourself,,don't bet against yourself,,and take risks." 
 NASA has this phrase that they like:,"Failure is not an option.",But failure has to be an option,in art and in exploration, because it's a leap of faith.,And no important endeavor,that required innovation,was done without risk.,You have to be willing to take those risks.,So, that's the thought I would leave you with,,is that in whatever you're doing,,failure is an option,,but fear is not. Thank you.,(Applause)I'm Jane McGonigal. I'm a game designer.,I've been making gamesnonline now for 10 years,,and my goal for the next decade,is to try to make it as easynto save the world in real life,as it is to save the worldnin online games.,Now, I have a plan for this,,and it entails convincing more people,,including all of you, to spend more timenplaying bigger and better games. 
 Right now we spend three billion hoursna week playing online games.,Some of you might be thinking,,"That's a lot of timento spend playing games.,Maybe too much time,,considering how many urgent problemsnwe have to solve in the real world.",But actually, according to my researchnat the Institute for the Future,,actually the opposite is true.,Three billion hours a weeknis not nearly enough game play,to solve the world's most urgent problems. 
 In fact, I believenthat if we want to survive,the next century on this planet,,we need to increasenthat total dramatically.,I've calculated the total we need,at 21 billion hoursnof game play every week.,So, that's probably a bitnof a counter-intuitive idea,,so I'll say it again, let it sink in:,If we want to solve problems like hunger,,poverty, climate change,nglobal conflict, obesity,,I believe that we need to aspirento play games online,for at least 21 billion hours a week,nby the end of the next decade. 
 (Laughter) 
 No. I'm serious. I am. 
 Here's why.,This picture pretty much sums upnwhy I think games are so essential,to the future survivalnof the human species. 
 (Laughter) 
 Truly.,This is a portraitnby photographer Phil Toledano.,He wanted to capturenthe emotion of gaming,,so he set up a camera in frontnof gamers while they were playing.,And this is a classic gaming emotion.,Now, if you're not a gamer,,you might miss somenof the nuance in this photo.,You probably see the sense of urgency,,a little bit of fear,nbut intense concentration,,deep, deep focus on tacklingna really difficult problem. 
 If you are a gamer, you will noticena few nuances here:,the crinkle of the eyes up,nand around the mouth,is a sign of optimism,,and the eyebrows up is surprise.,This is a gamer who's on the vergenof something called an "epic win." 
 (Laughter) 
 Oh, you've heard of that.,OK, good, so we have some gamers among us.,An epic win is an outcomenthat is so extraordinarily positive,,you had no idea it was evennpossible until you achieved it.,It was almost beyond the thresholdnof imagination, and when you get there,,you're shocked to discovernwhat you're truly capable of.,That's an epic win.,This is a gamer on the vergenof an epic win.,And this is the face that we need to see,on millions of problem-solversnall over the world,as we try to tackle the obstaclesnof the next century --,the face of someone who, against all odds,,is on the verge of an epic win. 
 Now, unfortunately this is morenof the face that we see,in everyday life now as we trynto tackle urgent problems.,This is what I callnthe "I'm Not Good At Life" face.,This is actually me making it.,Can you see? Yes. Good.,This is me makingnthe "I'm Not Good At Life" face.,This is a piece of graffitinin my old neighborhood,in Berkeley, California,nwhere I did my PhD,on why we're better in gamesnthan we are in real life.,And this is a problemnthat a lot of gamers have.,We feel that we are not as goodnin reality as we are in games. 
 I don't mean just good as in successful,nalthough that's part of it.,We do achieve more in game worlds.,But I also mean good as in motivatednto do something that matters --,inspired to collaborate and to cooperate.,And when we're in game worlds,,I believe that many of us becomenthe best version of ourselves --,the most likely to helpnat a moment's notice,,the most likely to sticknwith a problem as long at it takes,,to get up after failure and try again.,And in real life, when we face failure,,when we confront obstacles,nwe often don't feel that way.,We feel overcome, we feel overwhelmed,,we feel anxious, maybe depressed,nfrustrated or cynical.,We never have those feelingsnwhen we're playing games,,they just don't exist in games.,So that's what I wanted to studynwhen I was a graduate student. 
 What about games makes it impossible,to feel that we can't achieve everything?,How can we take those feelings from games,and apply them to real-world work?,So I looked at gamesnlike World of Warcraft,,which is really the ideal collaborativenproblem-solving environment.,And I started to notice a few things,that make epic winsnso possible in online worlds. 
 The first thing is whenever you show upnin one of these online games,,especially in World of Warcraft,,there are lots and lotsnof different characters,who are willing to trust younwith a world-saving mission, right away.,But not just any mission,,it's a mission that is perfectly matchednwith your current level in the game.,Right? So you can do it.,They never give you a challengenyou can't achieve.,But it is on the vergenof what you're capable of,,so you have to try hard.,But there's no unemploymentnin World of Warcraft; no sitting around,,wringing your hands --,there's always somethingnspecific and important to be done.,There are also tons of collaborators.,Everywhere you go,nhundreds of thousands of people,ready to work with younto achieve your epic mission. 
 That's not something we havenin real life that easily,,this sense that at our fingertipsnare tons of collaborators.,And there's this epic story,nthis inspiring story of why we're there,,and what we're doing,,and we get all this positive feedback.,You guys have heard of leveling up,n+1 strength, +1 intelligence.,We don't get that kindnof constant feedback in real life.,When I get off this stage,,I'm not going to haven+1 speaking, and +1 crazy idea,,+20 crazy idea.,I don't get that feedback in real life. 
 Now, the problem with collaborativenonline environments like World of Warcraft,is that it's so satisfying to benon the verge of an epic win all the time,,we decide to spend all our timenin these game worlds.,It's just better than reality.,So, so far, collectivelynall the World of Warcraft gamers,have spent 5.93 million years,solving the virtual problems of Azeroth.,Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing.,It might sound like it's a bad thing.,But to put that in context:,5.93 million years ago,was when our earliest primatenhuman ancestors stood up.,That was the first upright primate. 
 So when we talk about how much time,we're currently investingnin playing games,,the only way it makes sensento even think about it,is to talk about timenat the magnitude of human evolution,,which is an extraordinary thing.,But it's also apt,,because it turns out that by spendingnall this time playing games,,we're actually changingnwhat we are capable of as human beings.,We're evolving to be a morencollaborative and hearty species.,This is true. I believe this. 
 So, consider this reallyninteresting statistic;,it was recently published by a researchernat Carnegie Mellon University:,The average young person todaynin a country with a strong gamer culture,will have spent 10,000 hoursnplaying online games,by the age of 21.,Now 10,000 hours is a reallyninteresting number for two reasons.,First of all, for childrennin the United States,,10,080 hours is the exact amountnof time you will spend in school,,from fifth gradento high school graduation,,if you have perfect attendance. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, we have an entirenparallel track of education going on,,where young people are learning as muchnabout what it takes to be a good gamer,as they're learningnabout everything else in school.,Some of you have probably readnMalcolm Gladwell's new book "Outliers,",so you would have heardnof his theory of success,,the "10,000 hours" theory of success.,It's based on this greatncognitive-science research,that says if we can master 10,000 hours,of effortful study at anythingnby the age of 21,,we will be virtuosos at it.,We will be as good at whatever we do,as the greatest people in the world.,And so, now what we're looking at,is an entire generation of young peoplenwho are virtuoso gamers. 
 So, the big question is,,"What exactly are gamersngetting so good at?",Because if we could figure that out,,we would have a virtually unprecedentednhuman resource on our hands.,This is how many peoplenwe now have in the world,who spend at least an hourna day playing online games.,These are our virtuoso gamers,,500 million people who arenextraordinarily good at something.,And in the next decade,,we're going to have another billion gamers,who are extraordinarilyngood at whatever that is.,If you don't know it already,nthis is coming.,The game industry is developing consoles,that are low-energy and that worknwith the wireless phone networks,instead of broadband Internet,,so that gamers all over the world,,particularly in India, China,nBrazil, can get online.,They expect one billion morengamers in the next decade.,It will bring us up to 1.5 billion gamers. 
 So I've started to think about,what these gamesnare making us virtuosos at.,Here are the four things I came up with.,The first is urgent optimism.,OK, think of thisnas extreme self-motivation.,Urgent optimism is the desirento act immediately,to tackle an obstacle,,combined with the belief that we havena reasonable hope of success.,Gamers always believenthat an epic win is possible,,and that it's always worthntrying, and trying now.,Gamers don't sit around.,Gamers are virtuososnat weaving a tight social fabric.,There's a lot of interestingnresearch that shows,we like people betternafter we play a game with them,,even if they've beaten us badly.,And the reason is, it takes a lot of trustnto play a game with someone.,We trust that they will spendntheir time with us,,that they will play by the same rules,,value the same goal,nstay with the game until it's over. 
 And so, playing a game together,actually builds up bondsnand trust and cooperation.,And we actually build strongernsocial relationships as a result.,Blissful productivity. I love it.,You know, there's a reason whynthe average World of Warcraft gamer,plays for 22 hours a week --nkind of a half-time job.,It's because we know,nwhen we're playing a game,,that we're actually happier working hard,than we are relaxing, or hanging out.,We know that we arenoptimized as human beings,,to do hard and meaningful work.,And gamers are willingnto work hard all the time,,if they're given the right work. 
 Finally: epic meaning.,Gamers love to be attachednto awe-inspiring missions,to human planetary-scale stories.,So, just one bit of trivianthat helps put that into perspective:,So, you all know Wikipedia,nbiggest wiki in the world.,Second biggest wiki in the world,nwith nearly 80,000 articles,,is the World of Warcraft wiki.,Five million people use it every month.,They have compiled more informationnabout World of Warcraft on the Internet,than any other topic coverednon any other wiki in the world.,They are building an epic story.,They are building an epicnknowledge resource,about the World of Warcraft. 
 Okay, so these are four superpowersnthat add up to one thing:,Gamers are super-empowerednhopeful individuals.,These are people who believenthat they are individually capable,of changing the world.,And the only problem is,,they believe that they are capablenof changing virtual worlds,and not the real world.,That's the problemnthat I'm trying to solve. 
 There's an economistnnamed Edward Castronova.,His work is brilliant.,He looks at why people are investingnso much time and energy,and money in online worlds.,And he says,,"We're witnessing what amounts tonno less than a mass exodus,to virtual worlds and onlinengame environments.",And he's an economist, so he's rational.,And he says -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Not like me, I'm a gamendesigner; I'm exuberant.,But he says that this makes perfect sense,,because gamers can achievenmore in online worlds,than they can in real life.,They can have strongernsocial relationships in games,than they can have in real life;,they get better feedbacknand feel more rewarded in games,than they do in real life.,So he says, for now it makes perfect sense,for gamers to spend more timenin virtual worlds than the real world.,Now, I also agreenthat that is rational, for now.,But it is not, by any means,nan optimal situation.,We have to start makingnthe real world work more like a game. 
 I take my inspirationnfrom something that happened,2,500 years ago.,These are ancient dice,nmade out of sheep's knuckles.,Before we had awesome game controllers,,we had sheep's knuckles.,And these representnthe first game equipment,designed by human beings,,and if you're familiar with the worknof the ancient Greek historian Herodotus,,you might know this history,,which is the historynof who invented games and why.,Herodotus says that games,nparticularly dice games,,were invented in the kingdom of Lydia,,during a time of famine. 
 Apparently, there was such a severe famine,that the king of Lydia decidednthey had to do something crazy.,People were suffering.nPeople were fighting.,It was an extreme situation,nthey needed an extreme solution.,So, according to Herodotus,nthey invented dice games,,and they set up a kingdom-wide policy:,On one day, everybody would eat,,and on the next day,neverybody would play games.,And they would be so immersednin playing the dice games,,because games are so engaging,,and immerse us in such satisfying,nblissful productivity,,they would ignore the factnthat they had no food to eat.,And then on the next day,nthey would play games;,and on the next day, they would eat. 
 And according to Herodotus,,they passed 18 years this way,,surviving through a famine,,by eating on one day,nand playing games on the next.,Now, this is exactly, I think,nhow we're using games today.,We're using games to escapenreal-world suffering --,we're using games to get away,from everything that's brokennin the real environment,,everything that's not satisfyingnabout real life,,and we're getting what we need from games. 
 But it doesn't have to end there.,This is really exciting.,According to Herodotus, after 18 yearsnthe famine wasn't getting better,,so the king decided they wouldnplay one final dice game.,They divided the entire kingdom in half.,They played one dice game,,and the winners of that gamengot to go on an epic adventure.,They would leave Lydia,,and they would go out in searchnof a new place to live,,leaving behind just enough people,to survive on the resourcesnthat were available,,and hopefully to take their civilizationnsomewhere else where they could thrive. 
 Now, this sounds crazy, right?,But recently, DNA evidencenhas shown that the Etruscans,,who then led to the Roman Empire,,actually share the same DNAnas the ancient Lydians.,And so, recently,nscientists have suggested,that Herodotus' crazynstory is actually true.,And geologists have foundnevidence of a global cooling,that lasted for nearly 20 years,nthat could have explained the famine.,So this crazy story might be true.,They might have actually savedntheir culture by playing games,,escaping to games for 18 years,,and then been so inspired,,and knew so much aboutnhow to come together with games,,that they actually savednthe entire civilization that way. 
 Okay, we can do that. 
 (Laughter) 
 We've been playing Warcraft since 1994.,That was the first real-time strategyngame from the World of Warcraft series.,That was 16 years ago.,They played dice games for 18 years,,we've been playing Warcraft for 16 years.,I say we are ready for our own epic game.,Now, they had half the civilizationngo off in search of a new world,,so that's where I get my 21 billionnhours a week of game-play from.,Let's get half of us to agree,to spend an hour a day playing games,,until we solve real-world problems. 
 Now, I know you're asking,,"How are we going to solvenreal-world problems in games?",Well, that's what I've devotednmy work to over the past few years,,at the Institute for the Future.,We have this bannernin our offices in Palo Alto,,and it expresses our view of hownwe should try to relate to the future.,We do not want to trynto predict the future.,What we want to do is make the future.,We want to imaginenthe best-case scenario outcome,,and then we want to empower peoplento make that outcome a reality.,We want to imagine epic wins,,and then give people the meansnto achieve the epic win. 
 I'm just going to very briefly show younthree games that I've made,that are an attempt to give peoplenthe means to create epic wins,in their own futures.,This is World Without Oil.,We made this game in 2007.,This is an online game,in which you try to survivenan oil shortage.,The oil shortage is fictional,,but we put enough online content out there,for you to believe that it's real,,and to live your real lifenas if we've run out of oil.,So when you come to the game,,you sign up, tell us where you live,,and then we give younreal-time news videos,,data feeds that show younexactly how much oil costs,,what's not available, how foodnsupply is being affected,,how transportation is being affected,,if schools are closed, if there's rioting,,and you have to figure outnhow you would live your real life,as if this were true.,And then we ask you to blog about it,,to post videos, to post photos. 
 We piloted this gamenwith 1,700 players in 2007,,and we've tracked themnfor the three years since.,And I can tell you that thisnis a transformative experience.,Nobody wants to change how they live,,just because it's good for the world,nor because we're supposed to.,But if you immerse themnin an epic adventure,and tell them, "We've run out of oil.,This is an amazing storynand adventure for you to go on.,Challenge yourself to seenhow you would survive,",most of our playersnhave kept up the habits,that they learned in this game. 
 So for the next world-saving game,,we decided to aim higher --nbigger problem than just peak oil.,We did a game called Superstructnat the Institute for the Future.,And the premise was,na supercomputer has calculated,that humans have only 23 yearsnleft on the planet.,This supercomputer was called,the Global ExtinctionnAwareness System, of course.,We asked people to come online --,almost like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie.,You know Jerry Bruckheimernmovies, you form a dream team --,you've got the astronaut,nthe scientist, the ex-convict,,and they all have somethingnto do to save the world. 
 (Laughter) 
 But in our game, instead of just havingnfive people on the dream team,,we said, "Everybody's on the dream team,,and it's your job to inventnthe future of energy,,the future of food, the future of health,,the future of security and the futurenof the social safety net.",We had 8,000 peoplenplay that game for eight weeks.,They came up with 500ninsanely creative solutions,that you can go online,nGoogle "Superstruct," and see. 
 So, finally, the last game,,we're launching it March 3rd.,This is a game donenwith the World Bank Institute.,If you complete the game,,you will be certifiednby the World Bank Institute,as a Social Innovator, class of 2010.,Working with universitiesnall over sub-Saharan Africa,,and we are inviting themnto learn social innovation skills.,We've got a graphic novel,nwe've got leveling up,in skills like local insight,nknowledge networking,,sustainability,nvision and resourcefulness.,I would like to invite all of you,to please share this gamenwith young people,,anywhere in the world,nparticularly in developing areas,,who might benefit from coming together,to try to start to imagine their ownnsocial enterprises to save the world. 
 So, I'm going to wrap up now.,I want to ask a question.,What do you think happens next?,We've got all these amazing gamers,nwe've got these games,that are kind of pilotsnof what we might do,,but none of themnhave saved the real world yet.,Well I hope you will agree with menthat gamers are a human resource,that we can use to do real-world work,,that games are a powerfulnplatform for change.,We have all these amazing superpowers:,blissful productivity, the abilitynto weave a tight social fabric,,this feeling of urgent optimismnand the desire for epic meaning. 
 I really hope that we can come togethernto play games that matter,,to survive on this planetnfor another century.,That's my hope, that you will join menin making and playing games like this.,When I look forward to the next decade,nI know two things for sure:,that we can makenany future we can imagine,,and we can play any gamesnwe want, so I say:,Let the world-changing games begin. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I have a daughter, Mulan.,And when she was eight, last year,,she was doing a report for school,or she had some homework about frogs.,And we were at this restaurant,,and she said, "So, basically,,frogs lay eggs,and the eggs turn into tadpoles,,and tadpoles turn into frogs." 
 And I said, "Yeah. You know, I'm not really up on my frog reproduction that much.,It's the females, I think, that lay the eggs,,and then the males fertilize them.,And then they become tadpoles and frogs." 
 And she says, "What? Only the females have eggs?" 
 And I said, "Yeah." 
 And she goes, "And what's this fertilizing?" 
 So I kind of said, "Oh, it's this extra ingredient,,you know, that you need,to create a new frog,from the mom and dad frog." (Laughter) 
 And she said, "Oh, so is that true for humans too?" 
 And I thought, "Okay, here we go.",I didn't know it would happen so quick, at eight.,I was trying to remember all the guidebooks,,and all I could remember was,,"Only answer the question they're asking.,Don't give any more information." (Laughter),So I said, "Yes." 
 And she said, "And where do, um,,where do human women,,like, where do women lay their eggs?" 
 And I said, "Well,,funny you should ask. (Laughter),We have evolved to have our own pond.,We have our very own pond inside our bodies.,And we lay our eggs there,,we don't have to worry about other eggs or anything like that.,It's our own pond. And that's how it happens." 
 And she goes, "Then how do they get fertilized?" 
 And I said, "Well,,Men, through their penis,,they fertilize the eggs by the sperm coming out.,And you go through the woman's vagina." 
 And so we're just eating, and her jaw just drops,,and she goes, "Mom!,Like, where you go to the bathroom?" 
 And I said, "I know.,I know.",(Laughter),That's how we evolved. It does seem odd.,It is a little bit like having a waste treatment plant,right next to an amusement park ...,Bad zoning, but ..." (Laughter) 
 She's like, "What?" And she goes, "But Mom,,but men and women can't ever see each other naked, Mom.,So how could that ever happen?" 
 And then I go, "Well," and then I put my Margaret Mead hat on.,"Human males and females,develop a special bond,,and when they're much older, much, much older than you,,and they have a very special feeling,,then they can be naked together." 
 And she said, "Mom,,have you done this before?" 
 And I said, "Yes." 
 And she said, "But Mom, you can't have kids.",Because she knows that I adopted her and that I can't have kids. 
 And I said, "Yes." 
 And she said, "Well, you don't have to do that again." 
 And I said, "..." 
 And then she said, "But how does it happen when a man and woman are together?,Like, how do they know that's the time?,Mom, does the man just say,,'Is now the time to take off my pants?'" 
 (Laughter) 
 And I said, "Yes.",(Laughter),"That is exactly right.,That's exactly how it happens." 
 So we're driving home and she's looking out the window, and she goes,,"Mom. What if two just people saw each other on the street,,like a man and a woman, they just started doing it. Would that ever happen?" 
 And I said, "Oh, no. Humans are so private.,Oh ..." 
 And then she goes, "What if there was like a party,,and there was just like a whole bunch of girls and a whole bunch of boys,,and there was a bunch of men and women and they just started doing it, Mom?,Would that ever happen?" 
 And I said, "Oh, no, no.,That's not how we do it." 
 Then we got home and we see the cat. And she goes,,"Mom, how do cats do it?" 
 And I go, "Oh, it's the same. It's basically the same." 
 And then she got all caught up in the legs. "But how would the legs go, Mom?,I don't understand the legs.",She goes, "Mom, everyone can't do the splits." 
 And I go, "I know, but the legs ...",and I'm probably like, "The legs get worked out." 
 And she goes, "But I just can't understand it." 
 So I go, "You know, why don't we go on the Internet,,and maybe we can see ... like on Wikipedia." (Laughter) 
 So we go online, and we put in "cats mating.",And, unfortunately, on YouTube, there's many cats mating videos.,And we watched them and I'm so thankful,,because she's just like, "Wow! This is so amazing.",She goes, "What about dogs?",So we put in dogs mating, and,,you know, we're watching it, and she's totally absorbed. 
 And then she goes, "Mom,,do you think they would have, on the Internet,,any humans mating?",(Laughter),And then I realized that,I had taken my little eight year old's hand,,and taken her right into Internet porn. (Laughter) 
 And I looked into this,trusting, loving face,,and I said,,"Oh, no.,That would never happen." 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. I'm so happy to be here.You know for me, the interest in contemporary forms of slavery,started with a leaflet that I picked up in London.,It was the early '90s,,and I was at a public event.,I saw this leaflet and it said,,"There are millions of slaves in the world today.",And I thought, "No way, no way.",And I'm going to admit to hubris.,Because I also, I'm going to admit to you,,I also thought, "How can I be like,a hot-shot young full professor,who teaches human rights and not know this?,So it can't be true." 
 Well, if you teach, if you worship,in the temple of learning,,do not mock the gods,,because they will take you,,fill you with curiosity and desire,,and drive you. Drive you with a passion,to change things.,I went out and did a lit review,,3,000 articles on the key word "slavery.",Two turned out to be about contemporary -- only two.,All the rest were historical.,They were press pieces and they were full of outrage,,they were full of speculation, they were anecdotal --,no solid information. 
 So, I began to do a research project of my own.,I went to five countries around the world.,I looked at slaves. I met slaveholders,,and I looked very deeply,into slave-based businesses,because this is an economic crime.,People do not enslave people to be mean to them.,They do it to make a profit.,And I've got to tell you, what I found out in the world,in four different continents,,was depressingly familiar.,Like this:,Agricultural workers in Africa,,whipped and beaten,,showing us how they were beaten in the fields,before they escaped from slavery,and met up with our film crew.,It was mind-blowing. 
 And I want to be very clear.,I'm talking about real slavery.,This is not about lousy marriages,,this is not about jobs that suck.,This is about people who can not walk away,,people who are forced to work without pay,,people who are operating 24/7,under a threat of violence,and have no pay.,It's real slavery in exactly the same way,that slavery would be recognized,throughout all of human history. 
 Now, where is it?,Well, this map in the sort of redder, yellower colors,are the places with the highest densities of slavery.,But in fact that kind of bluey color,are the countries where we can't find any cases of slavery.,And you might notice that it's only Iceland and Greenland,where we can't find any cases of enslavement,around the world. 
 We're also particularly interested,and looking very carefully,at places where,slaves are being used to perpetrate,extreme environmental destruction.,Around the world, slaves are used to destroy the environment,,cutting down trees in the Amazon; destroying,forest areas in West Africa;,mining and spreading mercury around,in places like Ghana and the Congo;,destroying the coastal ecosystems in South Asia.,It's a pretty harrowing linkage,between what's happening to our environment,and what's happening to our human rights. 
 Now, how on Earth did we get to a situation like this,,where we have 27 million people,in slavery in the year 2010?,That's double the number that came out of Africa,in the entire transatlantic slave trade.,Well, it builds up with these factors.,They are not causal, they are actually supporting factors.,One we all know about, the population explosion:,the world goes from two billion people to almost,seven billion people in the last 50 years.,Being numerous does not make you a slave.,Add in the increased vulnerability of very large numbers of people,in the developing world,,caused by civil wars, ethnic conflicts,,kleptocratic governments, disease ... you name it, you know it. 
 We understand how that works. In some countries,all of those things happen at once,,like Sierra Leone a few years ago,,and push enormous parts ... about a billion people in the world, in fact,,as we know, live on the edge,,live in situations where,they don't have any opportunity and are usually even destitute.,But that doesn't make you a slave either.,What it takes to turn a person who is destitute and vulnerable,into a slave, is the absence of the rule of law.,If the rule of law is sound, it protects,the poor and it protects the vulnerable.,But if corruption creeps in,and people don't have the opportunity,to have that protection of the rule of law,,then if you can use violence,,if you can use violence with impunity,,you can reach out and harvest the vulnerable,into slavery. 
 Well, that is precisely what has happened around the world.,Though, for a lot of people,,the people who step,into slavery today,don't usually get kidnapped or knocked over the head.,They come into slavery because,someone has asked them this question. 
 All around the world I've been told an almost identical story.,People say, "I was home,,someone came into our village,,they stood up in the back of a truck, they said, 'I've got jobs,,who needs a job?'",And they did exactly what,you or I would do in the same situation.,They said, "That guy looked sketchy. I was suspicious,,but my children were hungry.,We needed medicine.,I knew I had to do anything I could,to earn some money to support the people I care about.",They climb into the back of the truck. They go off with the person who recruits them.,Ten miles, 100 miles, 1,000 miles later,,they find themselves in dirty, dangerous, demeaning work.,They take it for a little while,,but when they try to leave, bang!, the hammer comes down,,and they discover they're enslaved. 
 Now, that kind of slavery,is, again, pretty much what slavery has been all through human history.,But there is one thing that is particularly remarkable,and novel about slavery today,,and that is a complete collapse,in the price of human beings --,expensive in the past, dirt cheap now.,Even the business programs have started,picking up on this.,I just want to share a little clip for you. 
 Daphne: OK. Llively discussion guaranteed here, as always,,as we get macro and talk commodities.,Continuing here in the studio with our guest Michael O'Donohue,,head of commodities at Four Continents Capital Management.,And we're also joined by Brent Lawson,from Lawson Frisk Securities. 
 Brent Lawson: Happy to be here. 
 D: Good to have you with us, Brent.,Now, gentlemen ... Brent, where is your money going this year? 
 BL: Well Daphne, we've been going short on gas and oil recently,and casting our net just a little bit wider.,We really like the human being story a lot.,If you look at a long-term chart,,prices are at historical lows and yet global demand,for forced labor is still real strong.,So, that's a scenario that we think we should be capitalizing on. 
 D: Michael, what's your take on the people story? Are you interested? 
 Michael O'Donoghue: Oh definitely. Non-voluntary labor's greatest advantage,as an asset is the endless supply.,We're not about to run out of people. No other commodity has that. 
 BL: Daphne, if I may draw your attention to one thing.,That is that private equity has been sniffing around,,and that tells me that this market is about to explode.,Africans and Indians, as usual,,South Americans, and Eastern Europeans in particular,are on our buy list. 
 D: Interesting. Micheal, bottom line, what do you recommend? 
 MO: We're recommending to our clients,a buy and hold strategy.,There's no need to play the market.,There's a lot of vulnerable people out there. It's very exciting. 
 D: Exciting stuff indeed. Gentlemen, thank you very much. 
 Kevin Bales: Okay, you figured it out. That's a spoof.,Though I enjoyed watching,your jaws drop, drop, drop, until you got it.,MTV Europe worked with us and made that spoof,,and they've been slipping it in between music videos,without any introduction, which I think is kind of fun.,Here's the reality.,The price of human beings across the last 4,000 years,in today's money has averaged about 40,000 dollars.,Capital purchase items.,You can see that the lines cross when the population explodes. 
 The average price of a human being today,,around the world, is about 90 dollars.,They are more expensive in places like North America.,Slaves cost between 3,000 to 8,000 dollars in North America,,but I could take you places in India or Nepal,where human beings can be acquired for five or 10 dollars.,They key here is that,people have ceased to be that capital purchase item,and become like Styrofoam cups.,You buy them cheaply, you use them,,you crumple them up, and then when you're done,with them you just throw them away. 
 These young boys are in Nepal.,They are basically the transport system,on a quarry run by a slaveholder.,There are no roads there, so they carry loads of stone,on their backs, often of their own weight,,up and down the Himalaya Mountains.,One of their mothers said to us,,"You know, we can't survive here,,but we can't even seem to die either.",It's a horrible situation.,And if there is anything that makes me feel very positive about this,,it's that there are also --,in addition to young men like this who are still enslaved --,there are ex-slaves who are now working to free others.,Or, we say, Frederick Douglass is in the house. 
 I don't know if you've ever had a daydream,about, "Wow. What would it be like to meet Harriet Tubman?,What would it be like to meet Frederick Douglass?",I've got to say, one of the most exciting parts about my job,is that I get to,,and I want to introduce you to one of those.,His name is James Kofi Annan. He was a slave child in Ghana,enslaved in the fishing industry,,and he now, after escape and building a new life,,has formed an organization that we work closely with,to go back and get people out of slavery.,This is not James, this is one of the kids that he works with. 
 James Kofi Annan (Video): He was hit with a paddle,in the head. And this reminds me,of my childhood when I used to work here. 
 KB: James and our country director in Ghana,,Emmanuel Otoo are now receiving regular death threats,because the two of them managed to get,convictions and imprisonment for three human traffickers,for the very first time in Ghana,for enslaving people, from the fishing industry,,for enslaving children. 
 Now, everything I've been telling you,,I admit, is pretty disheartening.,But there is actually a very positive side to this,,and that is this: The 27 million people,who are in slavery today,,that's a lot of people, but it's also,the smallest fraction,of the global population to ever be in slavery.,And likewise, the 40 billion dollars that they generate,into the global economy each year,is the tiniest proportion of the global economy,to ever be represented by slave labor. 
 Slavery, illegal in every country,has been pushed to the edges of our global society.,And in a way, without us even noticing,,has ended up standing on the precipice,of its own extinction,,waiting for us to give it a big boot,and knock it over. And get rid of it.,And it can be done. 
 Now, if we do that, if we put the resources,and the focus to it,,what does it actually cost to get people out of slavery?,Well, first, before I even tell you the cost,I've got to be absolutely clear.,We do not buy people out of slavery.,Buying people out of slavery is like,paying a burglar to get your television back;,it's abetting a crime.,Liberation, however, costs some money. 
 Liberation, and more importantly,all the work that comes after liberation.,It's not an event, it's a process.,It's about helping people to build lives of dignity,,stability, economic autonomy,,citizenship.,Well, amazingly,,in places like India where costs are very low,,that family, that three-generation family that you see there,who were in hereditary slavery --,so, that granddad there, was born a baby into slavery --,but the total cost, amortized,across the rest of the work,,was about 150 dollars to bring that family,out of slavery and then take them through a two year process,to build a stable life of citizenship and education. 
 A boy in Ghana rescued from fishing slavery, about 400 dollars.,In the United States, North America,,much more expensive. Legal costs, medical costs ...,we understand that it's expensive here:,about 30,000 dollars.,But most of the people in the world in slavery,live in those places where,the costs are lowest.,And in fact, the global average is about what it is,for Ghana. 
 And that means, when you multiply it up,,the estimated cost of,not just freedom but sustainable freedom,for the entire 27 million people on the planet in slavery,is something like 10.8 billion dollars --,what Americans spend on potato chips and pretzels,,what Seattle is going to spend on its light rail system:,usually the annual expenditure in this country on blue jeans,,or in the last holiday period,when we bought GameBoys and iPods and other tech gifts for people,,we spent 10.8 billion dollars.,Intel's fourth quarter earnings: 10.8 billion. 
 It's not a lot of money at the global level.,In fact, it's peanuts.,And the great thing about it is that,it's not money down a hole,,there is a freedom dividend. When you let people out of slavery,to work for themselves,,are they motivated?,They take their kids out of the workplace,,they build a school, they say,,"We're going to have stuff we've never had before like three squares,,medicine when we're sick,,clothing when we're cold.",They become consumers and producers,and local economies begin to spiral up very rapidly. 
 That's important, all of that,about how we rebuild sustainable freedom,,because we'd never want to repeat,what happened in this country in 1865.,Four million people were lifted up out of slavery,and then dumped.,Dumped without political participation,,decent education,,any kind of real opportunity,in terms of economic lives,,and then sentenced to generations of,violence and prejudice and discrimination.,And America is still paying the price,for the botched emancipation of 1865. 
 We have made a commitment,that we will never let people,come out of slavery on our watch,,and end up as second class citizens.,It's just not going to happen.,This is what liberation really looks like.,Children rescued from slavery in the fishing industry in Ghana,,reunited with their parents,,and then taken with their parents back to their villages,to rebuild their economic well-being,so that they become slave-proof --,absolutely unenslaveable. 
 Now, this woman,lived in a village in Nepal.,We'd been working there about a month.,They had just begun to come out of a hereditary kind of slavery.,They'd just begun to light up a little bit,,open up a little bit.,But when we went to speak with her, when we took this photograph,,the slaveholders were still menacing us,from the sidelines. They hadn't been really pushed back.,I was frightened. We were frightened.,We said to her, "Are you worried? Are you upset?" 
 She said, "No, because we've got hope now.,How could we not succeed," she said,,"when people like you from the other side of the world,are coming here to stand beside us?" 
 Okay, we have to ask ourselves,,are we willing to live in a world with slavery?,If we don't take action, we just leave ourselves open,to have someone else jerk the strings,that tie us to slavery in the products we buy,,and in our government policies.,And yet, if there's one thing that every human being can agree on,,I think it's that slavery should end. 
 And if there is a fundamental violation,of our human dignity,that we would all say is horrific,,it's slavery.,And we've got to say,,what good is all of our intellectual,and political and economic power --,and I'm really thinking intellectual power in this room --,if we can't use it to bring slavery to an end?,I think there is enough intellectual power in this room,to bring slavery to an end.,And you know what? If we can't do that,,if we can't use our intellectual power to end slavery,,there is one last question:,Are we truly free?,Okay, thank you so much.,(Applause)I'm going to begin by reciting a poem.,"Oh beloved dentist:,Your rubber fingers in my mouth ...,your voice so soft and muffled ...,Lower the mask, dear dentist,,lower the mask." 
 (Laughter) 
 Okay, in this presentation,,I'm going to be putting the right side of your brains,through a fairly serious workout.,You're going to see a lot of imagery,,and it's not always connected to what I'm talking about,,so I need you to kind of split your brains in half,and let the images flow over one side,and listen to me on the other.,So I am one of those people,with a transformative personal story.,Six years ago,,after 20 years in graphic design and typography,,I changed the way I was working,and the way most graphic designers work,to pursue a more personal approach to my work,,with only the humble attempt,to simply make a living doing something that I loved.,But something weird happened.,I became bizarrely,popular.,My current work,seems to resonate with people,in a way that has so taken me by surprise,that I still frequently wonder,what in the hell is going on.,And I'm slowly coming to understand,that the appeal of what I do,may be connected to why I do it. 
 These days, I call myself a graphic artist.,So where my work as a graphic designer,was to follow strategy,,my work now,follows my heart,and my interests,with the guidance of my ego,to create work that is mutually beneficial to myself and a client.,Now, this is heresy,in the design world.,The ego is not supposed,to be involved in graphic design.,But I find that for myself,,without exception,,the more I deal with the work,as something of my own,,as something that is personal,,the more successful it is,as something that's compelling,,interesting and sustaining.,So I exist somewhat outside of the mainstream,of design thinking.,Where others might look at measurable results,,I tend to be interested in more ethereal qualities,,like "Does it bring joy?","Is there a sense of wonder?",and "Does it invoke curiosity?" 
 This is a scientific diagram, by the way.,I don't have time to explain it,,but it has to do with DNA and RNA.,So I have a particular imaginative approach to visual work.,The things that interest me when I'm working,are visual structure,,surprise,and anything that requires figuring things out.,So for this reason, I'm particularly drawn,to systems and patterns.,I'm going to give you a couple of examples of how my brain works. 
 This is a piece that I did for,The Guardian newspaper in the U.K.,They have a magazine that they call G2.,And this is for their puzzle special,in 2007.,And puzzling it is.,I started by creating a series of tiling units.,And these tiling units, I designed,specifically so that they would contain,parts of letterforms within their shapes,so that I could then,join those pieces together,to create letters and then words,within the abstract patterning.,But then as well, I was able to,just flip them, rotate them,and combine them in different ways,to create either regular patterns,or abstract patterns.,So here's the word puzzle again.,And here it is with the abstract surrounding.,And as you can see, it's extremely difficult to read.,But all I have to do is,fill certain areas of those letterforms,and I can bring those words out of,the background pattern.,But maybe that's a little too obvious.,So then I can add some color in with the background,and add a bit more color in with the words themselves,,and this way, working with the art director,,I'm able to bring it to just the right point,that it's puzzling for the audience --,they can figure out that there's something they have to read --,but it's not impossible for them to read. 
 I'm also interested in working with,unusual materials,and common materials in unusual ways.,So this requires figuring out how to,get the most out of something's innate properties,and also how to bend it to my will.,So ultimately,,my goal is to create something unexpected.,To this end, I have worked in sugar,for Stefan Sagmeister,,three-time TED speaker.,And this project began essentially,on my kitchen table.,I've been eating cereal for breakfast,all of my life.,And for that same amount of time,,I've been spilling sugar on the table,and just kind of playing with it with my fingers.,And eventually I used this technique,to create a piece of artwork.,And then I used it again to create,six pieces for Stefan's book,,"Things in My Life I've Learned So Far.",And these were created,without sketches, just freehand,,by putting the sugar down on a white surface,and then manipulating it to get,the words and designs out of it.,Recently, I've also made some,rather highbrow baroque borders,out of lowbrow pasta.,And this is for a chapter that I'm doing in a book,,and the chapter is on honor.,So it's a little bit unexpected,,but, in a way, it refers,to the macaroni art,that children make for their parents,or they make in school and give to their parents,,which is in itself a form of honor.,This is what you can do with some household tinfoil.,Okay, well, it's what I can do with some household tinfoil. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm very interested in wonder,,in design as an impetus to inquiring.,To say I wonder is to say,I question, I ask.,And to experience wonder is to experience awe.,So I'm currently working on a book,,which plays with both senses of the word,,as I explore some of my own ideas,and inquiries,in a visual display of rather,peacock-like grandeur.,The world is full of wonder.,But the world of graphic design,,for the most part, is not.,So I'm using my own writings,as a kind of testing ground for a book that has,an interdependency between word and image,as a kind of seductive force.,I think that one of the things,that religions got right,was the use of visual wonder,to deliver a message.,I think this true marriage of art and information,is woefully underused in adult literature,,and I'm mystified as to,why visual wealth is not more commonly used,to enhance intellectual wealth.,When we look at works like this,,we tend to associate them with children's literature.,There's an implication that ornamental graphics,detract from the seriousness of the content.,But I really hope to have the opportunity,to change that perception.,This book is taking rather a long time,,but I'm nearly done. 
 For some reason, I thought it would be a good idea,to put an intermission,in my talk.,And this is it -- just to give you and me a moment to catch up. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I do these valentines.,I've been sending out valentines,on a fairly large scale since 2005.,These are my valentines,from 2005 and 2006.,And I started by,doing just a single image like this,and sending them out to each person.,But in 2007,,I got the cockamamie idea,to hand-draw each valentine,for everyone on my mailing list.,I reduced my mailing list to 150 people.,And I drew each person,their own unique valentine,and put their name on it,and numbered it and signed it and sent it out.,Believe it or not, I devised this,as a timesaving method.,I was very busy in the beginning of that year,,and I didn't know when I was going to find time,to design and print a single valentine.,And I thought that I could kind of do this piecemeal,as I was traveling.,It didn't exactly work out that way.,There's a longer story to this,,but I did get them all done in time,,and they were extremely well received.,I got an almost 100 percent response rate.,(Laughter),And those who didn't respond,will never receive anything from me ever again. 
 (Laughter) 
 Last year,,I took a more conceptual approach to the valentine.,I had this idea that I wanted people,to receive a kind of,mysterious love letter,,like a found fragment in their mailbox.,I wanted it to be something,that was not addressed to them,or signed by me,,something that caused them to wonder,what on Earth this thing was.,And I specifically wrote,four pages that don't connect.,There were four different versions of this.,And I wrote them,so that they begin in the middle of a sentence,,end in the middle of a sentence.,And they're on the one hand, universal,,so I avoid specific names or places,,but on the other hand, they're personal.,So I wanted people to really get the sense that,they had received something that could have been,a love letter to them.,And I'm just going to read one of them to you. 
 "You've never really been sure of this,,but I can assure you that this quirk,you're so self-conscious of,is intensely endearing.,Just please accept that this piece of you,escapes with your smile,,and those of us who notice,are happy to catch it in passing.,Time spent with you is like chasing and catching small birds,,but without the scratches and bird shit.",(Laughter),"That is to say,,your thoughts and words flit and dart,,disconcertedly elusive at times,,but when caught and examined --,ahh, such a wonder,,such a delightful reward.,There's no passing time with you,,only collecting --,the collecting of moments with the hope for preservation,and at the same time release.,Impossible? I don't think so.,I know this makes you embarrassed.,I'm certain I can see you blushing.,But I just have to tell you because,sometimes I hear your self-doubt,,and it's so crushing to think,that you may not know how truly wonderful you are,,how inspiring and delightful,and really, truly the most completely ..." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 So Valentine's Day,is coming up in a couple of days,,and these are currently arriving,in mailboxes all around the world.,This year, I got, what I really have to say,is a rather brilliant idea,,to laser cut,my valentines,out of used Christmas cards.,So I solicited friends,to send me their used Christmas cards,,and I made 500 of these.,Each one of them is completely different.,I'm just really, really thrilled with them.,I don't have that much else to say,,but they turned out really well. 
 I do spend a lot of time on my work.,And one of the things that I've been thinking about recently,is what is worth while.,What is it that's worth spending my time on,and my life on in this way?,Working in the commercial world,,this is something that I do have to struggle with at times.,And yes, sometimes I'm swayed by money.,But ultimately, I don't consider that a worthy goal.,What makes something worthwhile for me,is the people I work for or with,,the conditions I work under,and the audience that I'm able to reach.,So I might ask: "Who is it for?","What does it say?",and "What does it do?" 
 You know, I have to tell you, it's really difficult,for someone like me to come up on stage,at this conference,with these unbelievably brilliant minds,,who are thinking these,really big-picture,,world-changing, life-changing,ideas and technologies.,And it's very, very common,for designers and people in the visual arts,to feel that we're,not contributing enough,,or worse, that all we're doing is,contributing to landfill.,Here I am; I'm showing you,some pretty visuals,and talking about aesthetics.,But I've come to believe that,truly imaginative visual work,is extremely important in society. 
 Just in the way that I'm inspired,by books,and magazines of all kinds,,conversations I have, movies,,so I also think,,when I put visual work out there into the mass media,,work that is interesting, unusual,,intriguing,,work that maybe opens up that sense,of inquiry in the mind,,that I'm seeding the imagination of the populace.,And you just never know who,is going to take something from that,and turn it into something else,,because inspiration,is cross-pollinating.,So a piece of mine,may inspire a playwright,or a novelist or a scientist,,and that in turn may be the seed,that inspires a doctor,or a philanthropist,or a babysitter.,And this isn't something that you can quantify,or track or measure,,and we tend to undervalue things in society,that we can't measure. 
 But I really believe,that a fully operating, rich society,needs these seeds coming from all directions,and all disciplines,in order to keep the gears of inspiration,and imagination,flowing and cycling and growing.,So that's why I do what I do,,and why I spend so much time and effort on it,,and why I work in the commercial, public sphere,,as opposed to the isolated, private sphere,of fine art:,because I want as many people as possible,to see my work, notice it, be drawn into it,,and be able to take something from it.,And I actually really feel that it's worthwhile,to spend my valuable,and limited time on this Earth,in this way.,And I thank you for allowing me to show it to you. 
 (Applause)Why grow homes? Because we can.,Right now, America is in an unremitting state of trauma.,And there's a cause for that, all right.,We've got McPeople, McCars, McHouses.,As an architect, I have to confront something like this. 
 So what's a technology that will allow us,to make ginormous houses?,Well, it's been around for 2,500 years.,It's called pleaching, or grafting trees together,,or grafting inosculate matter into one contiguous, vascular system.,And we do something different,than what we did in the past;,we add kind of a modicum of intelligence to that.,We use CNC to make scaffolding,to train semi-epithetic matter, plants,,into a specific geometry,that makes a home that we call a Fab Tree Hab.,It fits into the environment. It is the environment.,It is the landscape, right? 
 And you can have a hundred million of these homes,,and it's great because they suck carbon.,They're perfect.,You can have 100 million families, or take things out of the suburbs,,because these are homes that are a part of the environment.,Imagine pre-growing a village --,it takes about seven to 10 years --,and everything is green. 
 So not only do we do the veggie house,,we also do the in-vitro meat habitat,,or homes that we're doing research on now in Brooklyn,,where, as an architecture office, we're for the first of its kind,to put in a molecular cell biology lab,and start experimenting with regenerative medicine,and tissue engineering,and start thinking about what the future would be,if architecture and biology became one. 
 So we've been doing this for a couple of years, and that's our lab.,And what we do is we grow,extracellular matrix from pigs.,We use a modified inkjet printer,,and we print geometry.,We print geometry where we can make industrial design objects,like, you know, shoes, leather belts,,handbags, etc.,,where no sentient creature is harmed.,It's victimless. It's meat from a test tube.,So our theory is that eventually,we should be doing this with homes. 
 So here is a typical stud wall,,an architectural construction,,and this is a section,of our proposal for a meat house,,where you can see we use fatty cells as insulation,,cilia for dealing with wind loads,and sphincter muscles for the doors and windows. 
 (Laughter) 
 And we know it's incredibly ugly.,It could have been an English Tudor or Spanish Colonial,,but we kind of chose this shape.,And there it is kind of grown, at least one particular section of it. 
 We had a big show in Prague,,and we decided to put it in front of the cathedral,so religion can confront the house of meat.,That's why we grow homes. Thanks very much. 
 (Applause)(Music) 
 ♫ My age is three hundred ♫ 
 ♫ and seventy-two ♫ 
 ♫ I think with the deepest regret ♫ 
 ♫ How I used to pick up 
 and voraciously chew ♫ 
 ♫ the dear little boys 
 that I met ♫ 
 ♫ I've eaten them raw 
 in their holiday suits, ♫ 
 ♫ Eaten them 
 curried with rice, ♫ 
 ♫ I've eaten them baked 
 in their jackets and boots, ♫ 
 ♫ And found them exceedingly nice. ♫ 
 ♫ But now that my jaws 
 are too weak for such fare, ♫ 
 ♫ I think it's increasingly rude ♫ 
 ♫ To do such a thing 
 when I'm quite well aware ♫ 
 ♫ Little boys do not like 
 being chewed. ♫ 
 ♫ Little boys do not like

 (Applause) 
 I suppose I owe you an explanation.,I've been working on a project for the last six years,adapting children's poetry to music.,And that's a poem by Charles Edward Carryl,,who was a stockbroker in New York City,for 45 years,,but in the evenings, he wrote nonsense for his children.,And this book was one of the most famous books in America,for about 35 years.,"The Sleepy Giant," which is the song that I just sang,,is one of his poems.,Now, we're going to do,other poems for you,,and here's a preview of some of the poets.,This is Rachel Field,,Robert Graves --,a very young Robert Graves --,Christina Rossetti.,Ghosts, right?,Have nothing to say to us,,obsolete,,gone --,not so.,What I really enjoyed about this project,is reviving these people's words.,Taking them off the dead, flat pages.,Bringing them to life,,bringing them to light.,So, what we're going to do next,is a poem that was written by Nathalia Crane.,Nathalia Crane was a little girl from Brooklyn.,When she was 10 years old in 1927,,she published her first book of poems,called "The Janitor's Boy.",Here she is.,And here's her poem. 
 (Music) 
 ♫ Oh, I'm in love 
 with the janitor's boy, ♫ 
 ♫ And the janitor's boy 
 is in love with me. ♫ 
 ♫ Oh, I'm in love 
 with the janitor's boy, ♫ 
 ♫ And the janitor's boy 
 is in love with me. ♫ 
 ♫ He's going to hunt for a desert isle ♫ 
 ♫ In our geography. ♫ 
 ♫ A desert isle 
 with spicy trees ♫ 
 ♫ Somewhere in Sheepshead Bay; ♫ 
 ♫ A right nice place, 
 just fit for two ♫ 
 ♫ Where we can live always. ♫ 
 ♫ Oh, I'm in love 
 with the janitor's boy, ♫ 
 ♫ And the janitor's boy, ♫ 
 he's busy as can be; ♫ 
 ♫ Down in the cellar he's making a raft ♫ 
 ♫ Out of an old settee. ♫ 
 ♫ He'll carry me off, 
 I know that he will, ♫ 
 ♫ For his hair is exceedingly red; ♫ 
 ♫ And the only thing 
 that occurs to me ♫ 
 ♫ Is to dutifully shiver in bed. ♫ 
 ♫ And on the day that we sail, 
 I will leave a little note ♫ 
 ♫ For my parents I hate to annoy: ♫ 
 ♫ "I have flown to an island 
 in the bay ♫ 
 ♫ With my janitor's 
 red haired-boy." ♫ 
 ♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫ 
 ♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫ 
 ♫ The janitor's red-haired boy ♫

 The next poem is by E.E. Cummings,,"Maggie and Milly and Molly and May." 
 (Music) 
 ♫ Maggie and Milly, 
 Molly and May ♫ 
 ♫ They went down to the beach 
 one day to play ♫ 
 ♫ And Maggie discovered 
 a shell that sang ♫ 
 ♫ So sweetly she couldn't remember 
 her troubles ♫ 
 ♫ Maggie and Milly, 
 Molly and May ♫ 
 ♫ Maggie and Milly, 
 Molly and May ♫ 
 ♫ Milly befriended 
 a stranded star ♫ 
 ♫ Whose rays, 
 whose rays ♫ 
 ♫ Five languid fingers 
 were ♫ 
 (Music) 
 ♫ Maggie and Milly, 
 Molly and May ♫ 
 ♫ Maggie and Milly, 
 Molly and May ♫ 
 (Music) 
 ♫ Molly was chased 
 by a horrible thing ♫ 
 ♫ Which raced 
 sideways blowing ♫ 
 ♫ Blowing ♫ 
 ♫ Blowing ♫ 
 ♫ May came home 
 with a smooth, round stone ♫ 
 ♫ Small as a world 
 and as large as alone ♫ 
 (Music) 
 ♫ For whatever we lose 
 like a you or a me ♫ 
 ♫ Always ourselves 
 that we find 
 at the sea ♫ 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 The next poem is "If No One Ever Marries Me.",It was written by Laurence Alma-Tadema.,She was the daughter of a very, very famous Dutch painter,who had made his fame in England.,He went there after the death,of his wife of smallpox,and brought his two young children.,One was his daughter, Laurence.,She wrote this poem when she was,18 years old in 1888,,and I look at it as kind of a,very sweet feminist manifesto,tinged with a little bit of defiance,and a little bit of resignation and regret. 
 (Music) 
 ♫ Well, if no one ever marries me ♫ 
 ♫ And I don't see why they should, ♫ 
 ♫ Nurse says I'm not pretty, ♫ 
 ♫ And you know I'm seldom good, 
 seldom good -- ♫ 
 ♫ Well, if no one ever marries me ♫ 
 ♫ I shan't mind very much; ♫ 
 ♫ Buy a squirrel in a cage ♫ 
 ♫ And a little rabbit-hutch. ♫ 
 ♫ If no one marries me ♫ 
 ♫ If no one marries me ♫ 
 ♫ If no one marries me ♫ 
 ♫ If no one marries me ♫ 
 ♫ If no one marries me ♫ 
 ♫ I'll have a cottage near a wood ♫ 
 ♫ And a pony all my own ♫ 
 ♫ A little lamb quite clean and tame ♫ 
 ♫ That I can take to town. ♫ 
 ♫ And when I'm really getting old -- ♫ 
 ♫ And 28 or nine -- ♫ 
 ♫ Buy myself a little orphan girl ♫ 
 ♫ And bring her up as mine. ♫ 
 ♫ If no one marries me ♫ 
 ♫ If no one marries me ♫ 
 ♫ If no one marries me ♫ 
 ♫ If no one marries me ♫ 
 ♫ Well, if no one marries me ♫ 
 ♫ Marries me ♫ 
 ♫ Well, if no one marries me ♫ 
 ♫ Marries me ♫ 
 ♫ Well, if no one marries me ♫,Thank you. 
 (Applause) Thank you. 
 I became very curious about the poets,after spending six years with them,,and started to research their lives,,and then decided to write a book about it.,And the burning question about Alma-Tadema,was: Did she marry?,And the answer was no,,which I found in the London Times archive.,She died alone in 1940,in the company of her books and her dear friends.,Gerard Manley Hopkins,,a saintly man.,He became a Jesuit.,He converted from his Anglican faith.,He was moved to by the Tractarian Movement,,the Oxford Movement, otherwise known as --,and he became a Jesuit priest.,He burned all his poetry at the age of 24,and then did not write another poem for at least seven years,because he couldn't rectify the life of a poet,with the life of a priest.,He died typhoid fever,at the age of 44, I believe,,43 or 44.,At the time, he was teaching classics,at Trinity College in Dublin.,A few years before he died,,after he had resumed writing poetry,,but in secret,,he confessed to a friend in a letter,that I found when I was doing my research:,"I've written a verse.,It is to explain death to a child,,and it deserves a piece of plain-song music.",And my blood froze when I read that,because I had written the plain-song music,130 years after he'd written the letter.,And the poem is called, "Spring and Fall." 
 ♫ Margaret, 
 are you grieving ♫ 
 ♫ Over Goldengrove 
 unleaving, by and by? ♫ 
 ♫ Leaves, like the things 
 of man, you ♫ 
 ♫ With your fresh thoughts care for, 
 can you? ♫ 
 ♫ But as the heart grows older ♫ 
 ♫ It will come to such sights 
 much colder ♫ 
 ♫ By and by, 
 nor spare a sigh ♫ 
 ♫ Though worlds of 
 wanwood leafmeal lie; ♫ 
 ♫ And yet you will weep 
 and you'll know why. ♫ 
 ♫ No matter child, the name: ♫ 
 ♫ Sorrow's springs are all the same ♫ 
 ♫ They're all the same. ♫ 
 ♫ Nor mouth had 
 nor no mind expressed ♫ 
 ♫ What heart heard of, 
 ghost had guessed: ♫ 
 ♫ It's the blight 
 man was born for, ♫ 
 ♫ It is Margaret 
 that you mourn for ♫ 
 Thank you so much.

 Finger popping,,ain't no stopping.,Thank you so much. 
 (Applause)We invent.,My company invents,all kinds of new technology,in lots of different areas.,And we do that for a couple of reasons.,We invent for fun --,invention is a lot of fun to do --,and we also invent for profit.,The two are related because,the profit actually takes long enough that if it isn't fun,,you wouldn't have the time to do it.,So we do this,fun and profit-oriented inventing,for most of what we do,,but we also have a program where we invent for humanity --,where we take some of our best inventors,,and we say, "Are there problems,where we have a good idea for solving a problem the world has?" --,and to solve it in the way we try to solve problems,,which is with dramatic, crazy,,out-of-the-box solutions.,Bill Gates is one of those smartest guys of ours,that work on these problems,and he also funds this work, so thank you.,So I'm going to briefly discuss,a couple of problems that we have,and a couple of problems where,we've got some solutions underway. 
 Vaccination is one of the,key techniques in public health,,a fantastic thing.,But in the developing world a lot of vaccines,spoil before they're administered,,and that's because they need to be kept cold.,Almost all vaccines need to be kept at refrigerator temperatures.,They go bad very quickly if you don't,,and if you don't have stable power grid, this doesn't happen,,so kids die.,It's not just the loss of the vaccine that matters;,it's the fact that those kids don't get vaccinated.,This is one of the ways that,vaccines are carried:,These are Styrofoam chests. These are being carried by people,,but they're also put on the backs of pickup trucks.,We've got a different solution.,Now, one of these Styrofoam chests,will last for about four hours with ice in it. 
 And we thought, well, that's not really good enough.,So we made this thing.,This lasts six months with no power;,absolutely zero power,,because it loses less,than a half a watt.,Now, this is our second generations prototype.,The third generation prototype is, right now,,in Uganda being tested.,Now, the reason we were able to come up with this,is two key ideas:,One is that this is similar to a cryogenic Dewar,,something you'd keep liquid nitrogen or liquid helium in.,They have incredible insulation,,so let's put some incredible insulation here.,The other idea is kind of interesting,,which is, you can't reach inside anymore.,Because if you open it up and reach inside,,you'd let the heat in, the game would be over.,So the inside of this thing actually looks like a Coke machine.,It vends out little individual vials.,So a simple idea,,which we hope is going to change the way vaccines are distributed,in Africa and around the world. 
 We'll move on to malaria.,Malaria is one of the great public health problems.,Esther Duflo talked a little bit about this.,Two hundred million people a year.,Every 43 seconds a child in Africa dies;,27 will die during my talk.,And there's no way for us here in this country,to grasp really what that means to the people involved.,Another comment of Esther's,was that we react when there's,a tragedy like Haiti,,but that tragedy is ongoing.,So what can we do about it?,Well, there are a lot of things people have tried,for many years for solving malaria.,You can spray; the problem is there are environmental issues.,You can try to treat people and create awareness.,That's great, except the places that have malaria really bad,,they don't have health care systems.,A vaccine would be a terrific thing,,only they don't work yet.,People have tried for a long time. There are a couple of interesting candidates.,It's a very difficult thing to make a vaccine for.,You can distribute bed nets,,and bed nets are very effective if you use them.,You don't always use them for that. People fish with them.,They don't always get to everyone.,And bed nets,have an effect on the epidemic,,but you're never going to make it extinct with bed nets. 
 Now, malaria is,an incredibly complicated disease.,We could spend hours going over this.,It's got this sort of soap opera-like lifestyle;,they have sex, they burrow into your liver,,they tunnel into your blood cells ...,it's an incredibly complicated disease,,but that's actually one of the things we find interesting about it,and why we work on malaria:,There's a lot of potential ways in.,One of those ways might be better diagnosis.,So we hope this year,to prototype each of these devices.,One does an automatic malaria diagnosis,in the same way that a diabetic's glucose meter works:,You take a drop of blood,,you put it in there and it automatically tells you.,Today, you need to do a complicated laboratory procedure,,create a bunch of microscope slides,and have a trained person examine it. 
 The other thing is, you know,,it would be even better if you didn't have to draw the blood.,And if you look through the eye,,or you look at the vessels on the white of the eye,,in fact, you may be able to do this,directly, without drawing any blood at all,,or through your nail beds.,Because if you actually look through your fingernails, you can see blood vessels,,and once you see blood vessels, we think we can see the malaria.,We can see it because of this molecule,called hemozoin.,It's produced by the malaria parasite,and it's a very interesting crystalline substance.,Interesting, anyway, if you're a solid-state physicist.,There's a lot of cool stuff we can do with it. 
 This is our femtosecond laser lab.,So this creates pulses of light,that last a femtosecond.,That's really, really, really short.,This is a pulse of light that's,only about one wavelength of light long,,so it's a whole bunch of photons,all coming and hitting simultaneously.,It creates a very high peak power,and it lets you do all kinds of interesting things;,in particular, it lets you find hemozoin.,So here's an image of red blood cells,,and now we can actually map,where the hemozoin and where the malaria parasites are,inside those red blood cells.,And using both this technique,and other optical techniques,,we think we can make those diagnostics.,We also have another hemozoin-oriented,therapy for malaria:,a way, in acute cases, to actually,take the malaria parasite and filter it out of the blood system.,Sort of like doing dialysis,,but for relieving the parasite load. 
 This is our thousand-core supercomputer.,We're kind of software guys,,and so nearly any problem that you pose,,we like to try to solve with some software.,One of the problems that you have if you're trying to eradicate malaria,or reduce it,is you don't know what's the most effective thing to do.,Okay, we heard about bed nets earlier.,You spend a certain amount per bed net.,Or you could spray.,You can give drug administration.,There's all these different interventions,but they have different kinds of effectiveness.,How can you tell?,So we've created, using our supercomputer,,the world's best computer model of malaria,,which we'll show you now. 
 We picked Madagascar.,We have every road,,every village,,every, almost, square inch of Madagascar.,We have all of the precipitation data,and the temperature data.,That's very important because the humidity and precipitation,tell you whether you've got,standing pools of water for the mosquitoes to breed.,So that sets the stage on which you do this.,You then have to introduce the mosquitoes,,and you have to model that,and how they come and go.,Ultimately, it gives you this.,This is malaria spreading,across Madagascar.,And this is this latter part of the rainy season.,We're going to the dry season now.,It nearly goes away in the dry season,,because there's no place for the mosquitoes to breed.,And then, of course, the next year it comes roaring back.,By doing these kinds of simulations,,we want to eradicate or control malaria,thousands of times in software,before we actually have to do it in real life;,to be able to simulate both the economic trade-offs --,how many bed nets versus how much spraying? --,or the social trade-offs --,what happens if unrest breaks out? 
 We also try to study our foe.,This is a high-speed camera view,of a mosquito.,And, in a moment,,we're going to see a view of the airflow.,Here, we're trying to visualize the airflow,around the wings of the mosquito,with little particles we're illuminating with a laser.,By understanding how mosquitoes fly,,we hope to understand how to make them not fly.,Now, one of the ways you can make them not fly,is with DDT.,This is a real ad.,This is one of those things you just can't make up.,Once upon a time, this was the primary technique,,and, in fact, many countries got rid of malaria through DDT.,The United States did.,In 1935, there were 150,000 cases a year,of malaria in the United States,,but DDT and a massive public health effort,managed to squelch it. 
 So we thought,,"Well, we've done all these things that are focused on the Plasmodium,,the parasite involved.,What can we do to the mosquito?,Well, let's try to kill it with consumer electronics.",Now, that sounds silly,,but each of these devices,has something interesting in it that maybe you could use.,Your Blu-ray player has,a very cheap blue laser.,Your laser printer has a mirror galvanometer,that's used to steer a laser beam very accurately;,that's what makes those little dots on the page.,And, of course, there's signal processing,and digital cameras.,So what if we could put all that together,to shoot them out of the sky with lasers? 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Now, in our company, this is what we call,"the pinky-suck moment." 
 (Laughter) 
 What if we could do that?,Now, just suspend disbelief for a moment,,and let's think of what could happen,if we could do that.,Well, we could protect very high-value targets like clinics.,Clinics are full of people that have malaria.,They're sick, and so they're less able to defend themselves from the mosquitoes.,You really want to protect them.,Of course, if you do that,,you could also protect your backyard.,And farmers could protect their crops,that they want to sell to Whole Foods,because our photons,are 100 percent organic. (Laughter),They're completely natural. 
 Now, it actually gets better than this.,You could, if you're really smart,,you could shine a nonlethal laser on the bug,before you zap it,,and you could listen to the wing beat frequency,and you could measure the size.,And then you could decide:,"Is this an insect I want to kill,,or an insect I don't want to kill?",Moore's law made computing cheap;,so cheap we can weigh,the life of an individual insect,and decide thumbs up,or thumbs down. (Laughter),Now, it turns out we only kill the female mosquitoes.,They're the only ones that are dangerous.,Mosquitoes only drink blood,to lay eggs.,Mosquitoes actually live ... their day-to-day nutrition,comes from nectar, from flowers --,in fact, in the lab, we feed ours raisins --,but the female needs the blood meal.,So, this sounds really crazy, right?,Would you like to see it? 
 Audience: Yeah! 
 Nathan Myhrvold: Okay, so our legal department prepared a disclaimer,,and here it is.,(Laughter),Now, after thinking about this a little bit,we thought, you know, it probably would be simpler,to do this with a nonlethal laser.,So, Eric Johanson, who built the device,,actually, with parts from eBay;,and Pablos Holman over here,,he's got mosquitoes in the tank.,We have the device over here.,And we're going to show you,,instead of the kill laser,,which will be a very brief, instantaneous pulse,,we're going to have a green laser pointer,that's going to stay on the mosquito for, actually, quite a long period of time;,otherwise, you can't see it very well.,Take it away Eric. 
 Eric Johanson: What we have here,is a tank on the other side of the stage.,And we have ... this computer screen,can actually see the mosquitoes as they fly around.,And Pablos, if he stirs up our mosquitoes a little bit,we can see them flying around.,Now, that's a fairly straightforward image processing routine,,and let me show you how it works.,Here you can see that the insects are being tracked,as they're flying around,,which is kind of fun.,Next we can actually light them up with a laser. (Laughter),Now, this is a low powered laser,,and we can actually pick up a wing-beat frequency.,So you may be able to hear some mosquitoes flying around. 
 NM: That's a mosquito wing beat you're hearing. 
 EJ: Finally, let's see what this looks like.,There you can see mosquitoes as they fly around, being lit up.,This is slowed way down,so that you have an opportunity to see what's happening.,Here we have it running at high-speed mode.,So this system that was built for TED is here to illustrate,that it is technically possible to actually deploy a system like this,,and we're looking very hard at how to make it,highly cost-effective to use in places like Africa and other parts of the world. 
 (Applause) 
 NM: So it wouldn't be any fun to show you that,without showing you what actually happens when we hit 'em.,(Laughter),(Laughter),This is very satisfying.,(Laughter),This is one of the first ones we did.,The energy's a little bit high here.,(Laughter),We'll loop around here in just a second, and you'll see another one.,Here's another one. Bang.,An interesting thing is, we kill them all the time;,we've never actually gotten the wings to shut off in midair.,The wing motor is very resilient.,I mean, here we're blowing wings off,but the wing motor keeps all the way down. 
 So, that's what I have. Thanks very much. 
 (Applause)For me, this story begins about 15 years ago,,when I was a hospice doctor at the University of Chicago.,And I was taking care of people who were dying and their families,in the South Side of Chicago.,And I was observing what happened to people and their families,over the course of their terminal illness.,And in my lab, I was studying the widower effect,,which is a very old idea in the social sciences,,going back 150 years,,known as "dying of a broken heart.",So, when I die, my wife's risk of death can double,,for instance, in the first year.,And I had gone to take care of one particular patient,,a woman who was dying of dementia.,And in this case, unlike this couple,,she was being cared for,by her daughter.,And the daughter was exhausted from caring for her mother.,And the daughter's husband,,he also was sick,from his wife's exhaustion.,And I was driving home one day,,and I get a phone call from the husband's friend,,calling me because he was depressed,about what was happening to his friend.,So here I get this call from this random guy,that's having an experience,that's being influenced by people,at some social distance. 
 And so I suddenly realized two very simple things:,First, the widowhood effect,was not restricted to husbands and wives.,And second, it was not restricted to pairs of people.,And I started to see the world,in a whole new way,,like pairs of people connected to each other.,And then I realized that these individuals,would be connected into foursomes with other pairs of people nearby.,And then, in fact, these people,were embedded in other sorts of relationships:,marriage and spousal,and friendship and other sorts of ties.,And that, in fact, these connections were vast,and that we were all embedded in this,broad set of connections with each other.,So I started to see the world in a completely new way,and I became obsessed with this.,I became obsessed with how it might be,that we're embedded in these social networks,,and how they affect our lives.,So, social networks are these intricate things of beauty,,and they're so elaborate and so complex,and so ubiquitous, in fact,,that one has to ask what purpose they serve.,Why are we embedded in social networks?,I mean, how do they form? How do they operate?,And how do they effect us? 
 So my first topic with respect to this,,was not death, but obesity.,It had become trendy,to speak about the "obesity epidemic.",And, along with my collaborator, James Fowler,,we began to wonder whether obesity really was epidemic,and could it spread from person to person,like the four people I discussed earlier.,So this is a slide of some of our initial results.,It's 2,200 people in the year 2000.,Every dot is a person. We make the dot size,proportional to people's body size;,so bigger dots are bigger people.,In addition, if your body size,,if your BMI, your body mass index, is above 30 --,if you're clinically obese --,we also colored the dots yellow.,So, if you look at this image, right away you might be able to see,that there are clusters of obese and,non-obese people in the image.,But the visual complexity is still very high.,It's not obvious exactly what's going on.,In addition, some questions are immediately raised:,How much clustering is there?,Is there more clustering than would be due to chance alone?,How big are the clusters? How far do they reach?,And, most importantly,,what causes the clusters? 
 So we did some mathematics to study the size of these clusters.,This here shows, on the Y-axis,,the increase in the probability that a person is obese,given that a social contact of theirs is obese,and, on the X-axis, the degrees of separation between the two people.,On the far left, you see the purple line.,It says that, if your friends are obese,,your risk of obesity is 45 percent higher.,And the next bar over, the [red] line,,says if your friend's friends are obese,,your risk of obesity is 25 percent higher.,And then the next line over says,if your friend's friend's friend, someone you probably don't even know, is obese,,your risk of obesity is 10 percent higher.,And it's only when you get to your friend's friend's friend's friends,that there's no longer a relationship,between that person's body size and your own body size. 
 Well, what might be causing this clustering?,There are at least three possibilities:,One possibility is that, as I gain weight,,it causes you to gain weight.,A kind of induction, a kind of spread from person to person.,Another possibility, very obvious, is homophily,,or, birds of a feather flock together;,here, I form my tie to you,because you and I share a similar body size.,And the last possibility is what is known as confounding,,because it confounds our ability to figure out what's going on.,And here, the idea is not that my weight gain,is causing your weight gain,,nor that I preferentially form a tie with you,because you and I share the same body size,,but rather that we share a common exposure,to something, like a health club,that makes us both lose weight at the same time. 
 When we studied these data, we found evidence for all of these things,,including for induction.,And we found that if your friend becomes obese,,it increases your risk of obesity by about 57 percent,in the same given time period.,There can be many mechanisms for this effect:,One possibility is that your friends say to you something like --,you know, they adopt a behavior that spreads to you --,like, they say, "Let's go have muffins and beer,",which is a terrible combination. (Laughter),But you adopt that combination,,and then you start gaining weight like them.,Another more subtle possibility,is that they start gaining weight, and it changes your ideas,of what an acceptable body size is.,Here, what's spreading from person to person,is not a behavior, but rather a norm:,An idea is spreading. 
 Now, headline writers,had a field day with our studies.,I think the headline in The New York Times was,,"Are you packing it on?,Blame your fat friends." (Laughter),What was interesting to us is that the European headline writers,had a different take: They said,,"Are your friends gaining weight? Perhaps you are to blame.",(Laughter),And we thought this was a very interesting comment on America,,and a kind of self-serving,,"not my responsibility" kind of phenomenon. 
 Now, I want to be very clear: We do not think our work,should or could justify prejudice,against people of one or another body size at all.,Our next questions was:,Could we actually visualize this spread?,Was weight gain in one person actually spreading,to weight gain in another person?,And this was complicated because,we needed to take into account the fact that the network structure,,the architecture of the ties, was changing across time.,In addition, because obesity is not a unicentric epidemic,,there's not a Patient Zero of the obesity epidemic --,if we find that guy, there was a spread of obesity out from him --,it's a multicentric epidemic.,Lots of people are doing things at the same time.,And I'm about to show you a 30 second video animation,that took me and James five years of our lives to do.,So, again, every dot is a person.,Every tie between them is a relationship.,We're going to put this into motion now,,taking daily cuts through the network for about 30 years. 
 The dot sizes are going to grow,,you're going to see a sea of yellow take over.,You're going to see people be born and die --,dots will appear and disappear --,ties will form and break, marriages and divorces,,friendings and defriendings.,A lot of complexity, a lot is happening,just in this 30-year period,that includes the obesity epidemic.,And, by the end, you're going to see clusters,of obese and non-obese individuals,within the network.,Now, when looked at this,,it changed the way I see things,,because this thing, this network,that's changing across time,,it has a memory, it moves,,things flow within it,,it has a kind of consistency --,people can die, but it doesn't die;,it still persists --,and it has a kind of resilience,that allows it to persist across time. 
 And so, I came to see these kinds of social networks,as living things,,as living things that we could put under a kind of microscope,to study and analyze and understand.,And we used a variety of techniques to do this.,And we started exploring all kinds of other phenomena.,We looked at smoking and drinking behavior,,and voting behavior,,and divorce -- which can spread --,and altruism.,And, eventually, we became interested in emotions.,Now, when we have emotions,,we show them.,Why do we show our emotions?,I mean, there would be an advantage to experiencing,our emotions inside, you know, anger or happiness.,But we don't just experience them, we show them.,And not only do we show them, but others can read them.,And, not only can they read them, but they copy them.,There's emotional contagion,that takes place in human populations.,And so this function of emotions,suggests that, in addition to any other purpose they serve,,they're a kind of primitive form of communication.,And that, in fact, if we really want to understand human emotions,,we need to think about them in this way. 
 Now, we're accustomed to thinking about emotions in this way,,in simple, sort of, brief periods of time.,So, for example,,I was giving this talk recently in New York City,,and I said, "You know when you're on the subway,and the other person across the subway car,smiles at you,,and you just instinctively smile back?",And they looked at me and said, "We don't do that in New York City." (Laughter),And I said, "Everywhere else in the world,,that's normal human behavior.",And so there's a very instinctive way,in which we briefly transmit emotions to each other.,And, in fact, emotional contagion can be broader still.,Like we could have punctuated expressions of anger,,as in riots.,The question that we wanted to ask was:,Could emotion spread,,in a more sustained way than riots, across time,and involve large numbers of people,,not just this pair of individuals smiling at each other in the subway car?,Maybe there's a kind of below the surface, quiet riot,that animates us all the time.,Maybe there are emotional stampedes,that ripple through social networks.,Maybe, in fact, emotions have a collective existence,,not just an individual existence. 
 And this is one of the first images we made to study this phenomenon.,Again, a social network,,but now we color the people yellow if they're happy,and blue if they're sad and green in between.,And if you look at this image, you can right away see,clusters of happy and unhappy people,,again, spreading to three degrees of separation.,And you might form the intuition,that the unhappy people,occupy a different structural location within the network.,There's a middle and an edge to this network,,and the unhappy people seem to be,located at the edges.,So to invoke another metaphor,,if you imagine social networks as a kind of,vast fabric of humanity --,I'm connected to you and you to her, on out endlessly into the distance --,this fabric is actually like,an old-fashioned American quilt,,and it has patches on it: happy and unhappy patches.,And whether you become happy or not,depends in part on whether you occupy a happy patch. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, this work with emotions,,which are so fundamental,,then got us to thinking about: Maybe,the fundamental causes of human social networks,are somehow encoded in our genes.,Because human social networks, whenever they are mapped,,always kind of look like this:,the picture of the network.,But they never look like this.,Why do they not look like this?,Why don't we form human social networks,that look like a regular lattice?,Well, the striking patterns of human social networks,,their ubiquity and their apparent purpose,beg questions about whether we evolved to have,human social networks in the first place,,and whether we evolved to form networks,with a particular structure. 
 And notice first of all -- so, to understand this, though,,we need to dissect network structure a little bit first --,and notice that every person in this network,has exactly the same structural location as every other person.,But that's not the case with real networks.,So, for example, here is a real network of college students,at an elite northeastern university.,And now I'm highlighting a few dots.,If you look here at the dots,,compare node B in the upper left,to node D in the far right;,B has four friends coming out from him,and D has six friends coming out from him.,And so, those two individuals have different numbers of friends.,That's very obvious, we all know that.,But certain other aspects,of social network structure are not so obvious. 
 Compare node B in the upper left to node A in the lower left.,Now, those people both have four friends,,but A's friends all know each other,,and B's friends do not.,So the friend of a friend of A's,is, back again, a friend of A's,,whereas the friend of a friend of B's is not a friend of B's,,but is farther away in the network.,This is known as transitivity in networks.,And, finally, compare nodes C and D:,C and D both have six friends.,If you talk to them, and you said, "What is your social life like?",they would say, "I've got six friends.,That's my social experience.",But now we, with a bird's eye view looking at this network,,can see that they occupy very different social worlds.,And I can cultivate that intuition in you by just asking you:,Who would you rather be,if a deadly germ was spreading through the network?,Would you rather be C or D?,You'd rather be D, on the edge of the network.,And now who would you rather be,if a juicy piece of gossip -- not about you --,was spreading through the network? (Laughter),Now, you would rather be C. 
 So different structural locations,have different implications for your life.,And, in fact, when we did some experiments looking at this,,what we found is that 46 percent of the variation,in how many friends you have,is explained by your genes.,And this is not surprising. We know that some people are born shy,and some are born gregarious. That's obvious.,But we also found some non-obvious things.,For instance, 47 percent in the variation,in whether your friends know each other,is attributable to your genes.,Whether your friends know each other,has not just to do with their genes, but with yours.,And we think the reason for this is that some people,like to introduce their friends to each other -- you know who you are --,and others of you keep them apart and don't introduce your friends to each other.,And so some people knit together the networks around them,,creating a kind of dense web of ties,in which they're comfortably embedded.,And finally, we even found that,30 percent of the variation,in whether or not people are in the middle or on the edge of the network,can also be attributed to their genes.,So whether you find yourself in the middle or on the edge,is also partially heritable. 
 Now, what is the point of this?,How does this help us understand?,How does this help us,figure out some of the problems that are affecting us these days?,Well, the argument I'd like to make is that networks have value.,They are a kind of social capital.,New properties emerge,because of our embeddedness in social networks,,and these properties inhere,in the structure of the networks,,not just in the individuals within them.,So think about these two common objects.,They're both made of carbon,,and yet one of them has carbon atoms in it,that are arranged in one particular way -- on the left --,and you get graphite, which is soft and dark.,But if you take the same carbon atoms,and interconnect them a different way,,you get diamond, which is clear and hard.,And those properties of softness and hardness and darkness and clearness,do not reside in the carbon atoms;,they reside in the interconnections between the carbon atoms,,or at least arise because of the,interconnections between the carbon atoms.,So, similarly, the pattern of connections among people,confers upon the groups of people,different properties.,It is the ties between people,that makes the whole greater than the sum of its parts.,And so it is not just what's happening to these people --,whether they're losing weight or gaining weight, or becoming rich or becoming poor,,or becoming happy or not becoming happy -- that affects us;,it's also the actual architecture,of the ties around us. 
 Our experience of the world,depends on the actual structure,of the networks in which we're residing,and on all the kinds of things that ripple and flow,through the network.,Now, the reason, I think, that this is the case,is that human beings assemble themselves,and form a kind of superorganism.,Now, a superorganism is a collection of individuals,which show or evince behaviors or phenomena,that are not reducible to the study of individuals,and that must be understood by reference to,,and by studying, the collective.,Like, for example, a hive of bees,that's finding a new nesting site,,or a flock of birds that's evading a predator,,or a flock of birds that's able to pool its wisdom,and navigate and find a tiny speck,of an island in the middle of the Pacific,,or a pack of wolves that's able,to bring down larger prey.,Superorganisms have properties,that cannot be understood just by studying the individuals.,I think understanding social networks,and how they form and operate,can help us understand not just health and emotions,but all kinds of other phenomena --,like crime, and warfare,,and economic phenomena like bank runs,and market crashes,and the adoption of innovation,and the spread of product adoption. 
 Now, look at this.,I think we form social networks,because the benefits of a connected life,outweigh the costs.,If I was always violent towards you,or gave you misinformation,or made you sad or infected you with deadly germs,,you would cut the ties to me,,and the network would disintegrate.,So the spread of good and valuable things,is required to sustain and nourish social networks.,Similarly, social networks are required,for the spread of good and valuable things,,like love and kindness,and happiness and altruism,and ideas.,I think, in fact, that if we realized,how valuable social networks are,,we'd spend a lot more time nourishing them and sustaining them,,because I think social networks,are fundamentally related to goodness.,And what I think the world needs now,is more connections. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I think it was in my second grade that I was caught,drawing the bust of a nude by Michelangelo.,I was sent straight away to my school principal,,and my school principal, a sweet nun,,looked at my book with disgust,,flipped through the pages, saw all the nudes --,you know, I'd been seeing my mother draw nudes and I'd copy her --,and the nun slapped me on my face and said,,"Sweet Jesus, this kid has already begun." 
 I had no clue what she was talking about,,but it was convincing enough for me never to draw again,until the ninth grade.,Thanks to a really boring lecture,,I started caricaturing my teachers in school.,And, you know, I got a lot of popularity.,I don't play sports. I'm really bad at sports.,I don't have the fanciest gadgets at home.,I'm not on top of the class.,So for me, cartooning gave me a sense of identity.,I got popular, but I was scared I'd get caught again.,So what I did was I quickly put together,a collage of all the teachers I had drawn,,glorified my school principal, put him right on top,,and gifted it to him.,He had a good laugh at the other teachers,and put it up on the notice board.,(Laughter),This is a part of that.,And I became a school hero.,All my seniors knew me. I felt really special. 
 I have to tell you a little bit about my family.,That's my mother. I love her to bits.,She's the one who taught me how to draw and, more importantly, how to love.,She's a bit of a hippie.,She said, "Don't say that," but I'm saying it anyway.,The rest of my family are boring academics,,busy collecting Ivy League decals for our classic Ambassador car.,My father's a little different.,My father believed in a holistic approach to living,,and, you know, every time he taught us,,he'd say, "I hate these books,,because these books are hijacked by Industrial Revolution." 
 While he still held that worldview, I was 16,,I got the best lawyer in town,,my older brother Karthik,,and I sat him down, and I said, "Pa,,from today onwards I've decided,I'm going to be disciplined,,I'm going to be curious,,I'm going to learn something new every day,,I'm going to be very hard working,,and I'm not going to depend on you,emotionally or financially.",And he was very impressed. He was all tearing up. Ready to hug me.,And I said, "Hold that thought.",I said, "Can I quit school then?" 
 But, to cut a long story short,,I quit school to pursue a career as a cartoonist.,I must have done about 30,000 caricatures.,I would do birthday parties, weddings, divorces,,anything for anyone who wanted to use my services.,But, most importantly, while I was traveling,,I taught children cartooning,,and in exchange, I learned how to be spontaneous.,And mad and crazy and fun.,When I started teaching them, I said let me start doing this professionally.,When I was 18 I started my own school.,However, an 18 year-old trying to start a school,is not easy unless you have a big patron,or a big supporter. 
 So I was flipping through the pages of the Times of India,when I saw that the Prime Minister of India,was visiting my home town, Bangalore.,And, you know, just like how,every cartoonist knows Bush here,,and if you had to meet Bush,,it would be the funnest thing because,his face was a cartoonist's delight.,I had to meet my Prime Minister.,I went to the place where,his helicopter was about to land.,I saw layers of security.,I caricatured my way through three layers,by just impressing the guards,,but I got stuck. I got stuck at the third.,And what happened was, to my luck,,I saw a nuclear scientist,at whose party I had done cartoons.,I ran up to him, and said, "Hello, sir. How do you do?",He said, "What are you doing here, Raghava?",I said, "I'm here to meet the Prime Minister.",He said, "Oh, so am I.",I hopped into his car, and off we went,through the remaining layers of security.,(Applause),Thank you.,I sat him down, I caricatured him,,and since then I've caricatured hundreds of celebrities. 
 This is one I remember fondly.,Salman Rushdie was pissed-off I think,because I altered the map of New York, if you notice.,(Laughter),Anyway, the next slide I'm about to show you --,(Laughter),Should I just turn that off?,The next slide I'm about to show you,,is a little more serious.,I was hesitant to include this in my presentation,because this cartoon was published,soon after 9/11.,What was, for me, a very naive observation,,turned out to be a disaster.,That evening, I came home to hundreds of hate mails,,hundreds of people telling me how they,could have lived another day without seeing this.,I was also asked to leave the organization,,a cartoonists' organization in America,,that for me was my lifeline.,That's when I realized, you know, cartoons are really powerful,,art comes with responsibility. 
 Anyway, what I did was I decided,that I need to take a break.,I quit my job at the papers, I closed my school,,and I wrapped up my pencils and my brushes and inks,,and I decided to go traveling.,When I went traveling, I remember,,I met this fabulous old man,,who I met when I was caricaturing,,who turned out to be an artist, in Italy.,He invited me to his studio. He said, "Come and visit.",When I went, I saw the ghastliest thing ever.,I saw this dead, naked effigy of himself,hanging from the ceiling.,I said, "Oh, my God. What is that?",And I asked him, and he said,,"Oh, that thing? In the night, I die.,In the morning, I am born again.",I thought he was koo koo,,but something about that really stuck.,I loved it. I thought there was something really beautiful about that.,So I said, "I am dead, so I need to be born again." 
 So, I wanted to be a painter like him,,except, I don't know how to paint.,So, I tried going to the art store.,You know, there are a hundred types of brushes.,Forget it, they will confuse you,even if you know how to draw.,So I decided, I'm going to learn to paint by myself.,I'm going to show you a very quick clip,to show you how I painted and a little bit,about my city, Bangalore.,(Music),They had to be larger than life.,Everything had to be larger. The next painting was even bigger.,And even bigger.,And for me it was, I had to dance while I painted.,It was so exciting.,Except, I even started painting dancers.,Here for example is a Flamenco dancer,,except there was one problem.,I didn't know the dance form, so I started following them,,and I made some money,,sold my paintings and would rush off,to France or Spain and work with them.,That's Pepe Linares, the renowned Flamenco singer. 
 But I had one problem, my paintings never danced.,As much energy as I put into them,while making them, they never danced.,So I decided -- I had this crazy epiphany at two in the morning.,I called my friends, painted on their bodies,,and had them dance in front of a painting.,And, all of a sudden, my paintings came alive.,And then I was fortunate enough,to actually perform this in California with Velocity Circus.,And I sat like you guys there in the audience.,And I saw my work come alive.,You know, normally you work in isolation,,and you show at a gallery,,but here, the work was coming alive,,and it had some other artists working with me. 
 The collaborative effort was fabulous.,I said, I'm going to collaborate with anybody and everybody I meet.,I started doing fashion.,This is a fashion show we held in London.,The best collaboration, of course, is with children.,They are ruthless, they are honest,,but they're full of energy and fun.,This is a work, a library I designed for the Robin Hood Foundation.,And I must say, I spent time in the Bronx,working with these kids.,And, in exchange for me working with them,,they taught me how to be cool.,I don't think I've succeeded, but they've taught me.,They said, "Stop saying sorry. Say, my bad.",(Laughter) 
 Then I said, all this is good,,but I want to paint like a real painter.,American education is so expensive.,I was in India, and I was walking down the streets,,and I saw a billboard painter.,And these guys paint humongous paintings,,and they look really good.,And I wondered how they did it from so close.,So, one day I had the opportunity to meet one of these guys,,and I said, "How do you paint like that? Who taught you?",And he said, "Oh, it's very easy. I can teach you,,but we're leaving the city,,because billboard painters are a dying,,extinct bunch of artists,,because digital printing has totally replaced them and hijacked them.",I said, in exchange for education in how to paint,,I will support them, and I started a company.,And since then, I've been painting all over the place.,This is a painting I did of my wife in my apartment.,This is another painting.,And, in fact, I started painting on anything,,and started sending them around town. 
 Since I mentioned my wife, the most important collaboration,has been with her, Netra.,Netra and I met when she was 18.,I must have been 19 and a half then,,and it was love at first sight.,I lived in India. She lived in America.,She'd come every two months to visit me,,and then I said I'm the man,,I'm the man, and I have to reciprocate.,I have to travel seven oceans, and I have to come and see you.,I did that twice, and I went broke.,So then I said, "Nets, what do I do?",She said, "Why don't you send me your paintings?,My dad knows a bunch of rich guys.,We'll try and con them into buying it,,and then...",But it turned out, after I sent the works to her,,that her dad's friends,,like most of you, are geeks.,I'm joking.,(Laughter),No, they were really big geeks,,and they didn't know much about art.,So Netra was stuck with 30 paintings of mine. 
 So what we did was we rented a little van,and we drove all over the east coast trying to sell it.,She contacted anyone and everyone,who was willing to buy my work.,She made enough money, she sold off the whole collection,and made enough money to move me for four years,with lawyers, a company, everything,,and she became my manager.,That's us in New York.,Notice one thing,,we're equal here.,Something happened along the line.,(Laughter) 
 But this brought me -- with Netra managing my career --,it brought me a lot of success.,I was really happy. I thought of myself as a bit of a rockstar.,I loved the attention.,This is all the press we got, and we said,,it's time to celebrate.,And I said that the best way to celebrate is to marry Netra.,I said, "Let's get married.",And I said, "Not just married. Let's invite everyone who's helped us,,all the people who bought our work.",And you won't believe it, we put together a list of 7,000 people,,who had made a difference -- a ridiculous list,,but I was determined to bring them to India, so --,a lot of them were in India.,150 artists volunteered to help me with my wedding.,We had fashion designers, installation artists,,models, we had makeup artists, jewelry designers,,all kinds of people working with me,to make my wedding an art installation.,And I had a special installation in tribute to my in-laws.,I had the vegetable carvers work on that for me. 
 But all this excitement led,to the press writing about us.,We were in the papers, we're still in the news three years later,,but, unfortunately, something tragic happened right after.,My mother fell very ill.,I love my mother,and I was told all of a sudden that she was going to die.,And they said you have to say bye to her,,you have to do what you have to do.,And I was devastated.,I had shows booked up for another year.,I was on a high.,And I couldn't. I could not. 
 My life was not exuberant.,I could not live this larger than life person.,I started exploring the darker abscesses of the human mind.,Of course, my work turned ugly,,but another thing happened.,I lost all my audiences.,The Bollywood stars who I would party with,and buy my work disappeared.,The collectors, the friends, the press,,everyone said, "Nice, but thank you.","No thank you," was more like it.,But I wanted people to actually,feel my work from their gut,,because I was painting it from my gut.,If they wanted beauty,,I said, this is the beauty I'm willing to give you. It's politicized.,Of course, none of them liked it. 
 My works also turned autobiographical.,At this point, something else happened.,A very, very dear friend of mine,came out of the closet,,and in India at that time, it was illegal to be gay,,and it's disgusting to see how people respond to a gay person.,I was very upset.,I remember the time when my mother used to dress me up,as a little girl -- that's me there --,because she wanted a girl, and she has only boys.,(Laughter),Anyway, I don't know what my friends are going to say after this talk.,It's a secret. 
 So, after this, my works turned a little violent.,I talked about this masculinity that one need not perform.,And I talked about the weakness of male sexuality.,This time, not only did my collectors disappear,,the political activists decided to ban me,and to threaten me,and to forbid me from showing.,It turned nasty, and I'm a bit of a chicken.,I can't deal with any threat. This was a big threat. 
 So, I decided it was time,to end and go back home.,This time I said let's try something different.,I need to be reborn again.,And I thought the best way, as most of you know who have children,,the best way to have a new lease on life,,is to have a child.,I decided to have a child,,and before I did that, I quickly studied what can go wrong.,How can a family get dysfunctional?,And Rudra was born.,That's my little son. 
 And two magical things happened after he was born.,My mother miraculously recovered,after a serious operation,,and this man was elected president of this country.,You know I sat at home and I watched.,I teared up and I said that's where I want to be.,So Netra and I wound up our life,,closed up everything we had,,and we decided to move to New York.,And this was just eight months ago. 
 I moved back to New York, my work has changed.,Everything about my work has become more whimsical.,This one is called "What the Fuck Was I Thinking?",It talks about mental incest.,You know, I may appear to be a very nice, clean, sweet boy.,But I'm not. I'm capable of thinking anything.,But I'm very civil in my action, I assure you.,(Laughter),These are just different cartoons. 
 And, before I go, I want to tell you a little story.,I was talking to mother and father this morning,,and my dad said, "I know you have so much you want to say,,but you have to talk about your work with children.",So I said, okay. 
 I work with children all over the world,,and that's an entirely different talk,,but I want to leave you with one story,that really, really inspired me.,I met Belinda when she was 16.,I was 17.,I was in Australia,,and Belinda had cancer,,and I was told she's not going to live very long.,They, in fact, told me three weeks.,I walk into her room, and there was a shy girl,,and she was bald, and she was trying to hide her baldness.,I whipped out my pen, and I started drawing on her head,and I drew a crown for her.,And then, we started talking, and we spent a lovely time --,I told her how I ended up in Australia,,how I backpacked and who I conned, and how I got a ticket,,and all the stories.,And I drew it out for her.,And then I left.,Belinda died,and within a few days of her death,,they published a book for her,,and she used my cartoon on the cover.,And she wrote a little note, she said,,"Hey Rags, thank you for the magic carpet ride around the world." 
 For me, my art is my magic carpet ride.,I hope you will join me in this magic carpet ride,,and touch children and be honest.,Thank you so much.,(Applause)Imagine, if you will -- a gift.,I'd like for you to picture it in your mind.,It's not too big --,about the size of a golf ball.,So envision what it looks like all wrapped up.,But before I show you what's inside,,I will tell you, it's going to do incredible things for you.,It will bring all of your family together.,You will feel loved and appreciated like never before,and reconnect with friends and acquaintances,you haven't heard from in years.,Adoration and admiration,will overwhelm you.,It will recalibrate what's most important in your life. 
 It will redefine your sense,of spirituality and faith.,You'll have a new understanding,and trust in your body.,You'll have unsurpassed vitality and energy.,You'll expand your vocabulary,,meet new people,,and you'll have a healthier lifestyle.,And get this --,you'll have an eight-week vacation,of doing absolutely nothing.,You'll eat countless gourmet meals.,Flowers will arrive by the truckload.,People will say to you,,"You look great. Have you had any work done?",And you'll have a lifetime supply,of good drugs. 
 You'll be challenged, inspired,,motivated and humbled.,Your life will have new meaning.,Peace, health,,serenity, happiness,,nirvana.,The price?,$55,000,,and that's an incredible deal. 
 By now I know you're dying to know,what it is and where you can get one.,Does Amazon carry it?,Does it have the Apple logo on it?,Is there a waiting list?,Not likely.,This gift came to me about five months ago.,It looked more like this when it was all wrapped up --,not quite so pretty.,And this,,and then this.,It was a rare gem --,a brain tumor,,hemangioblastoma --,the gift that keeps on giving. 
 And while I'm okay now,,I wouldn't wish this gift for you.,I'm not sure you'd want it.,But I wouldn't change my experience.,It profoundly altered my life,in ways I didn't expect,in all the ways I just shared with you. 
 So the next time you're faced,with something that's unexpected,,unwanted and uncertain,,consider,that it just may be a gift. 
 (Applause)So I want to talk today about an idea. It's a big idea.,Actually, I think it'll eventually,be seen as probably the single biggest idea,that's emerged in the past century.,It's the idea of computation.,Now, of course, that idea has brought us,all of the computer technology we have today and so on.,But there's actually a lot more to computation than that.,It's really a very deep, very powerful, very fundamental idea,,whose effects we've only just begun to see. 
 Well, I myself have spent the past 30 years of my life,working on three large projects,that really try to take the idea of computation seriously.,So I started off at a young age as a physicist,using computers as tools.,Then, I started drilling down,,thinking about the computations I might want to do,,trying to figure out what primitives they could be built up from,and how they could be automated as much as possible.,Eventually, I created a whole structure,based on symbolic programming and so on,that let me build Mathematica.,And for the past 23 years, at an increasing rate,,we've been pouring more and more ideas,and capabilities and so on into Mathematica,,and I'm happy to say that that's led to many good things,in R & D and education,,lots of other areas.,Well, I have to admit, actually,,that I also had a very selfish reason for building Mathematica:,I wanted to use it myself,,a bit like Galileo got to use his telescope,400 years ago.,But I wanted to look not at the astronomical universe,,but at the computational universe. 
 So we normally think of programs as being,complicated things that we build,for very specific purposes.,But what about the space of all possible programs?,Here's a representation of a really simple program.,So, if we run this program,,this is what we get.,Very simple.,So let's try changing the rule,for this program a little bit.,Now we get another result,,still very simple.,Try changing it again.,You get something a little bit more complicated.,But if we keep running this for a while,,we find out that although the pattern we get is very intricate,,it has a very regular structure.,So the question is: Can anything else happen?,Well, we can do a little experiment.,Let's just do a little mathematical experiment, try and find out. 
 Let's just run all possible programs,of the particular type that we're looking at.,They're called cellular automata.,You can see a lot of diversity in the behavior here.,Most of them do very simple things,,but if you look along all these different pictures,,at rule number 30,,you start to see something interesting going on.,So let's take a closer look,at rule number 30 here.,So here it is.,We're just following this very simple rule at the bottom here,,but we're getting all this amazing stuff.,It's not at all what we're used to,,and I must say that, when I first saw this,,it came as a huge shock to my intuition.,And, in fact, to understand it,,I eventually had to create,a whole new kind of science. 
 (Laughter) 
 This science is different, more general,,than the mathematics-based science that we've had,for the past 300 or so years.,You know, it's always seemed like a big mystery:,how nature, seemingly so effortlessly,,manages to produce so much,that seems to us so complex.,Well, I think we've found its secret:,It's just sampling what's out there in the computational universe,and quite often getting things like Rule 30,or like this.,And knowing that starts to explain,a lot of long-standing mysteries in science.,It also brings up new issues, though,,like computational irreducibility.,I mean, we're used to having science let us predict things,,but something like this,is fundamentally irreducible.,The only way to find its outcome,is, effectively, just to watch it evolve.,It's connected to, what I call,,the principle of computational equivalence,,which tells us that even incredibly simple systems,can do computations as sophisticated as anything.,It doesn't take lots of technology or biological evolution,to be able to do arbitrary computation;,just something that happens, naturally,,all over the place.,Things with rules as simple as these can do it.,Well, this has deep implications,about the limits of science,,about predictability and controllability,of things like biological processes or economies,,about intelligence in the universe,,about questions like free will,and about creating technology. 
 You know, in working on this science for many years,,I kept wondering,,"What will be its first killer app?",Well, ever since I was a kid,,I'd been thinking about systematizing knowledge,and somehow making it computable.,People like Leibniz had wondered about that too,300 years earlier.,But I'd always assumed that to make progress,,I'd essentially have to replicate a whole brain.,Well, then I got to thinking:,This scientific paradigm of mine suggests something different --,and, by the way, I've now got,huge computation capabilities in Mathematica,,and I'm a CEO with some worldly resources,to do large, seemingly crazy, projects --,So I decided to just try to see,how much of the systematic knowledge that's out there in the world,we could make computable. 
 So, it's been a big, very complex project,,which I was not sure was going to work at all.,But I'm happy to say it's actually going really well.,And last year we were able,to release the first website version,of Wolfram Alpha.,Its purpose is to be a serious knowledge engine,that computes answers to questions.,So let's give it a try.,Let's start off with something really easy.,Hope for the best.,Very good. Okay.,So far so good.,(Laughter),Let's try something a little bit harder.,Let's do,some mathy thing,,and with luck it'll work out the answer,and try and tell us some interesting things,things about related math.,We could ask it something about the real world.,Let's say -- I don't know --,what's the GDP of Spain?,And it should be able to tell us that.,Now we could compute something related to this,,let's say ... the GDP of Spain,divided by, I don't know,,the -- hmmm ...,let's say the revenue of Microsoft. 
 (Laughter) 
 The idea is that we can just type this in,,this kind of question in, however we think of it.,So let's try asking a question,,like a health related question.,So let's say we have a lab finding that ...,you know, we have an LDL level of 140,for a male aged 50.,So let's type that in, and now Wolfram Alpha,will go and use available public health data,and try and figure out,what part of the population that corresponds to and so on.,Or let's try asking about, I don't know,,the International Space Station. 
 And what's happening here is that,Wolfram Alpha is not just looking up something;,it's computing, in real time,,where the International Space Station is right now at this moment,,how fast it's going, and so on.,So Wolfram Alpha knows about lots and lots of kinds of things.,It's got, by now,,pretty good coverage of everything you might find,in a standard reference library.,But the goal is to go much further,and, very broadly, to democratize,all of this knowledge,,and to try and be an authoritative,source in all areas.,To be able to compute answers to specific questions that people have,,not by searching what other people,may have written down before,,but by using built in knowledge,to compute fresh new answers to specific questions. 
 Now, of course, Wolfram Alpha,is a monumentally huge, long-term project,with lots and lots of challenges.,For a start, one has to curate a zillion,different sources of facts and data,,and we built quite a pipeline of Mathematica automation,and human domain experts for doing this.,But that's just the beginning.,Given raw facts or data,to actually answer questions,,one has to compute:,one has to implement all those methods and models,and algorithms and so on,that science and other areas have built up over the centuries.,Well, even starting from Mathematica,,this is still a huge amount of work.,So far, there are about 8 million lines,of Mathematica code in Wolfram Alpha,built by experts from many, many different fields. 
 Well, a crucial idea of Wolfram Alpha,is that you can just ask it questions,using ordinary human language,,which means that we've got to be able to take,all those strange utterances that people type into the input field,and understand them.,And I must say that I thought that step,might just be plain impossible.,Two big things happened:,First, a bunch of new ideas about linguistics,that came from studying the computational universe;,and second, the realization that having actual computable knowledge,completely changes how one can,set about understanding language.,And, of course, now,with Wolfram Alpha actually out in the wild,,we can learn from its actual usage.,And, in fact, there's been,an interesting coevolution that's been going on,between Wolfram Alpha,and its human users,,and it's really encouraging.,Right now, if we look at web queries,,more than 80 percent of them get handled successfully the first time.,And if you look at things like the iPhone app,,the fraction is considerably larger.,So, I'm pretty pleased with it all. 
 But, in many ways,,we're still at the very beginning with Wolfram Alpha.,I mean, everything is scaling up very nicely,and we're getting more confident.,You can expect to see Wolfram Alpha technology,showing up in more and more places,,working both with this kind of public data, like on the website,,and with private knowledge,for people and companies and so on.,You know, I've realized that Wolfram Alpha actually gives one,a whole new kind of computing,that one can call knowledge-based computing,,in which one's starting not just from raw computation,,but from a vast amount of built-in knowledge.,And when one does that, one really changes,the economics of delivering computational things,,whether it's on the web or elsewhere. 
 You know, we have a fairly interesting situation right now.,On the one hand, we have Mathematica,,with its sort of precise, formal language,and a huge network,of carefully designed capabilities,able to get a lot done in just a few lines.,Let me show you a couple of examples here.,So here's a trivial piece of Mathematica programming.,Here's something where we're sort of,integrating a bunch of different capabilities here.,Here we'll just create, in this line,,a little user interface that allows us to,do something fun there.,If you go on, that's a slightly more complicated program,that's now doing all sorts of algorithmic things,and creating user interface and so on.,But it's something that is very precise stuff.,It's a precise specification with a precise formal language,that causes Mathematica to know what to do here. 
 Then on the other hand, we have Wolfram Alpha,,with all the messiness of the world,and human language and so on built into it.,So what happens when you put these things together?,I think it's actually rather wonderful.,With Wolfram Alpha inside Mathematica,,you can, for example, make precise programs,that call on real world data.,Here's a real simple example.,You can also just sort of give vague input,and then try and have Wolfram Alpha,figure out what you're talking about.,Let's try this here.,But actually I think the most exciting thing about this,is that it really gives one the chance,to democratize programming.,I mean, anyone will be able to say what they want in plain language.,Then, the idea is that Wolfram Alpha will be able to figure out,what precise pieces of code,can do what they're asking for,and then show them examples that will let them pick what they need,to build up bigger and bigger, precise programs.,So, sometimes, Wolfram Alpha,will be able to do the whole thing immediately,and just give back a whole big program that you can then compute with.,Here's a big website,where we've been collecting lots of educational,and other demonstrations about lots of kinds of things.,I'll show you one example here.,This is just an example of one of these computable documents.,This is probably a fairly small,piece of Mathematica code,that's able to be run here. 
 Okay. Let's zoom out again.,So, given our new kind of science,,is there a general way to use it to make technology?,So, with physical materials,,we're used to going around the world,and discovering that particular materials,are useful for particular,technological purposes.,Well, it turns out we can do very much the same kind of thing,in the computational universe.,There's an inexhaustible supply of programs out there.,The challenge is to see how to,harness them for human purposes.,Something like Rule 30, for example,,turns out to be a really good randomness generator.,Other simple programs are good models,for processes in the natural or social world.,And, for example, Wolfram Alpha and Mathematica,are actually now full of algorithms,that we discovered by searching the computational universe.,And, for example, this -- if we go back here --,this has become surprisingly popular,among composers,finding musical forms by searching the computational universe.,In a sense, we can use the computational universe,to get mass customized creativity.,I'm hoping we can, for example,,use that even to get Wolfram Alpha,to routinely do invention and discovery on the fly,,and to find all sorts of wonderful stuff,that no engineer,and no process of incremental evolution would ever come up with. 
 Well, so, that leads to kind of an ultimate question:,Could it be that someplace out there in the computational universe,we might find our physical universe?,Perhaps there's even some quite simple rule,,some simple program for our universe.,Well, the history of physics would have us believe,that the rule for the universe must be pretty complicated.,But in the computational universe,,we've now seen how rules that are incredibly simple,can produce incredibly rich and complex behavior.,So could that be what's going on with our whole universe?,If the rules for the universe are simple,,it's kind of inevitable that they have to be,very abstract and very low level;,operating, for example, far below,the level of space or time,,which makes it hard to represent things.,But in at least a large class of cases,,one can think of the universe as being,like some kind of network,,which, when it gets big enough,,behaves like continuous space,in much the same way as having lots of molecules,can behave like a continuous fluid.,Well, then the universe has to evolve by applying,little rules that progressively update this network.,And each possible rule, in a sense,,corresponds to a candidate universe. 
 Actually, I haven't shown these before,,but here are a few of the candidate universes,that I've looked at.,Some of these are hopeless universes,,completely sterile,,with other kinds of pathologies like no notion of space,,no notion of time, no matter,,other problems like that.,But the exciting thing that I've found in the last few years,is that you actually don't have to go very far,in the computational universe,before you start finding candidate universes,that aren't obviously not our universe.,Here's the problem:,Any serious candidate for our universe,is inevitably full of computational irreducibility.,Which means that it is irreducibly difficult,to find out how it will really behave,,and whether it matches our physical universe.,A few years ago, I was pretty excited to discover,that there are candidate universes with incredibly simple rules,that successfully reproduce special relativity,,and even general relativity and gravitation,,and at least give hints of quantum mechanics.,So, will we find the whole of physics?,I don't know for sure,,but I think at this point it's sort of,almost embarrassing not to at least try. 
 Not an easy project.,One's got to build a lot of technology.,One's got to build a structure that's probably,at least as deep as existing physics.,And I'm not sure what the best way to organize the whole thing is.,Build a team, open it up, offer prizes and so on.,But I'll tell you, here today,,that I'm committed to seeing this project done,,to see if, within this decade,,we can finally hold in our hands,the rule for our universe,and know where our universe lies,in the space of all possible universes ...,and be able to type into Wolfram Alpha, "the theory of the universe,",and have it tell us. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I've been working on the idea of computation,now for more than 30 years,,building tools and methods and turning intellectual ideas,into millions of lines of code,and grist for server farms and so on.,With every passing year,,I realize how much more powerful,the idea of computation really is.,It's taken us a long way already,,but there's so much more to come.,From the foundations of science,to the limits of technology,to the very definition of the human condition,,I think computation is destined to be,the defining idea of our future. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: That was astonishing.,Stay here. I've got a question. 
 (Applause) 
 So, that was, fair to say, an astonishing talk.,Are you able to say in a sentence or two,how this type of thinking,could integrate at some point,to things like string theory or the kind of things that people think of,as the fundamental explanations of the universe? 
 Stephen Wolfram: Well, the parts of physics,that we kind of know to be true,,things like the standard model of physics:,what I'm trying to do better reproduce the standard model of physics,or it's simply wrong.,The things that people have tried to do in the last 25 years or so,with string theory and so on,have been an interesting exploration,that has tried to get back to the standard model,,but hasn't quite gotten there.,My guess is that some great simplifications of what I'm doing,may actually have considerable resonance,with what's been done in string theory,,but that's a complicated math thing,that I don't yet know how it's going to work out. 
 CA: Benoit Mandelbrot is in the audience.,He also has shown how complexity,can arise out of a simple start.,Does your work relate to his? 
 SW: I think so.,I view Benoit Mandelbrot's work,as one of the founding contributions,to this kind of area.,Benoit has been particularly interested,in nested patterns, in fractals and so on,,where the structure is something,that's kind of tree-like,,and where there's sort of a big branch that makes little branches,and even smaller branches and so on.,That's one of the ways,that you get towards true complexity.,I think things like the Rule 30 cellular automaton,get us to a different level.,In fact, in a very precise way, they get us to a different level,because they seem to be things that are,capable of complexity,that's sort of as great as complexity can ever get ... 
 I could go on about this at great length, but I won't. (Laughter) (Applause) 
 CA: Stephen Wolfram, thank you. 
 (Applause)Now, I want to start with a question:,When was the last timenyou were called "childish"?,For kids like me,,being called childishncan be a frequent occurrence.,Every time we make irrational demands,,exhibit irresponsible behavior,,or display any other signsnof being normal American citizens,,we are called childish.,Which really bothers me.,After all, take a look at these events:,Imperialism and colonization,,world wars, George W. Bush.,Ask yourself, who's responsible? Adults. 
 Now, what have kids done?,Well, Anne Frank touched millions,with her powerful accountnof the Holocaust.,Ruby Bridges helped to endnsegregation in the United States.,And, most recently,,Charlie Simpson helped to raisen120,000 pounds for Haiti,,on his little bike.,So as you can see evidencednby such examples,,age has absolutely nothing to do with it.,The traits the word "childish" addressesnare seen so often in adults,,that we should abolishnthis age-discriminatory word,,when it comes to criticizing behaviornassociated with irresponsibility,and irrational thinking. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 Then again, who's to saynthat certain types of irrational thinking,aren't exactly what the world needs?,Maybe you've had grand plans before,,but stopped yourself, thinking,,"That's impossible,"nor "That costs too much,",or "That won't benefit me.",For better or worse, we kidsnaren't hampered as much,when it comes to thinkingnabout reasons why not to do things.,Kids can be full of inspiringnaspirations and hopeful thinking,,like my wish that no one went hungry,,or that everything were free,na kind of utopia.,How many of you still dream like that,nand believe in the possibilities?,Sometimes a knowledge of historynand the past failures of Utopian ideals,can be a burden,,because you knownthat if everything were free,,then the food stocks would becomendepleted and scarce and lead to chaos.,On the other hand, we kidsnstill dream about perfection.,And that's a good thing, becausenin order to make anything a reality,,you have to dream about it first. 
 In many ways, our audacity to imagine,helps push the boundaries of possibility.,For instance, the Museumnof Glass in Tacoma, Washington,,my home state -- yoohoo, Washington! 
 (Applause) 
 has a program called Kids Design Glass,,and kids draw their ownnideas for glass art.,The resident artist saidnthey got some of their best ideas,from the program, because kidsndon't think about the limitations,of how hard it can be to blownglass into certain shapes,,they just think of good ideas.,Now, when you think of glass, younmight think of colorful Chihuly designs,,or maybe Italian vases,,but kids challenge glass artistsnto go beyond that,,into the realm of brokenhearted snakes,and bacon boys,nwho you can see has meat vision. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, our inherent wisdom doesn'tnhave to be insider's knowledge.,Kids already do a lotnof learning from adults,,and we have a lot to share.,I think that adults shouldnstart learning from kids.,Now, I do most of my speaking,in front of an education crowd --nteachers and students,,and I like this analogy:,It shouldn't be a teachernat the head of the class,,telling students, "Do this, do that.",The students should teach their teachers.,Learning between grown-upsnand kids should be reciprocal.,The reality, unfortunately,nis a little different,,and it has a lot to donwith trust, or a lack of it. 
 Now, if you don't trust someone,nyou place restrictions on them, right?,If I doubt my older sister's abilitynto pay back the 10 percent interest,I established on her last loan,,I'm going to withhold her abilitynto get more money from me,,until she pays it back. 
 (Laughter) 
 True story, by the way.,Now, adults seem to have,a prevalently restrictivenattitude towards kids,,from every "Don't do that, don't do this"nin the school handbook,,to restrictions on school Internet use.,As history points out,nregimes become oppressive,when they're fearfulnabout keeping control.,And although adultsnmay not be quite at the level,of totalitarian regimes,,kids have no or very little saynin making the rules,,when really, the attitudenshould be reciprocal,,meaning that the adultnpopulation should learn,and take into account the wishesnof the younger population. 
 Now, what's even worse than restriction,,is that adults oftennunderestimate kids' abilities.,We love challenges, but whennexpectations are low,,trust me, we will sink to them.,My own parents had anythingnbut low expectations,for me and my sister.,Okay, so they didn't tell us to becomendoctors or lawyers or anything like that,,but my dad did read to us about Aristotlenand pioneer germ-fighters,,when lots of other kids were hearing,"The Wheels on the BusnGo Round and Round.",Well, we heard that one too, butn"Pioneer Germ Fighters" totally rules. 
 (Laughter) 
 I loved to write from the agenof four, and when I was six,,my mom bought me my own laptopnequipped with Microsoft Word.,Thank you, Bill Gates, and thank you, Ma.,I wrote over 300 short storiesnon that little laptop,,and I wanted to get published.,Instead of just scoffing at this heresynthat a kid wanted to get published,,or saying wait until you're older,,my parents were really supportive.,Many publishers were notnquite so encouraging.,One large children'snpublisher ironically said,that they didn't work with children.,Children's publisher notnworking with children?,I don't know, you're kindnof alienating a large client there. 
 (Laughter) 
 One publisher, Action Publishing, wasnwilling to take that leap and trust me,,and to listen to what I had to say.,They published my first book,n"Flying Fingers," you see it here.,And from there on, it's gonento speaking at hundreds of schools,,keynoting to thousands of educators,,and finally, today, speaking to you. 
 I appreciate your attention today,,because to show that yountruly care, you listen.,But there's a problemnwith this rosy picture,of kids being so much better than adults.,Kids grow up and becomenadults just like you. 
 (Laughter) 
 Or just like you? Really?,The goal is not to turn kidsninto your kind of adult,,but rather, better adultsnthan you have been,,which may be a little challenging,nconsidering your guys' credentials. 
 (Laughter) 
 But the way progress happens,,is because new generations and new eras,grow and develop and becomenbetter than the previous ones.,It's the reason we're notnin the Dark Ages anymore.,No matter your position or place in life,,it is imperative to createnopportunities for children,,so that we can grow up to blow you away. 
 (Laughter) 
 Adults and fellow TEDsters,,you need to listen and learn from kids,,and trust us and expect more from us.,You must lend an ear today,,because we are the leadersnof tomorrow, which means,we're going to take care of younwhen you're old and senile.,No, just kidding. 
 (Laughter) 
 No, really, we are goingnto be the next generation,,the ones who will bringnthis world forward.,And in case you don't thinknthat this really has meaning for you,,remember that cloning is possible,,and that involves goingnthrough childhood again,,in which case you'll want to benheard, just like my generation.,Now, the world needs opportunitiesnfor new leaders and new ideas.,Kids need opportunitiesnto lead and succeed.,Are you ready to make the match?,Because the world's problemsnshouldn't be the human family's heirloom. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. Thank you.First of all, I'm a geek.,I'm an organic food-eating,,carbon footprint-minimizing, robotic surgery geek.,And I really want to build green,,but I'm very suspicious,of all of these well-meaning articles,,people long on moral authority,and short on data,,telling me how to do these kinds of things.,And so I have to figure this out for myself.,For example: Is this evil?,I have dropped a blob of organic yogurt,from happy self-actualized local cows,on my counter top,,and I grab a paper towel and I want to wipe it up.,But can I use a paper towel? (Laughter) 
 The answer to this can be found in embodied energy.,This is the amount of energy that goes into,any paper towel or embodied water,,and every time I use a paper towel,,I am using this much,virtual energy and water.,Wipe it up, throw it away.,Now, if I compare that to a cotton towel,that I can use a thousand times,,I don't have a whole lot of embodied energy,until I wash that yogurty towel.,This is now operating energy.,So if I throw my towel in the washing machine,,I've now put energy and water,back into that towel ...,unless I use a front-loading, high-efficiency washing machine, (Laughter),and then it looks a little bit better.,But what about a recycled paper towel,that comes in those little half sheets?,Well, now a paper towel looks better.,Screw the paper towels. Let's go to a sponge.,I wipe it up with a sponge, and I put it under the running water,,and I have a lot less energy and a lot more water.,Unless you're like me and you leave the handle,in the position of hot even when you turn it on,,and then you start to use more energy.,Or worse, you let it run until it's warm,to rinse out your towel.,And now all bets are off. 
 (Laughter) 
 So what this says is that,sometimes the things that you least expect --,the position in which you put the handle --,have a bigger effect than any of those other things,that you were trying to optimize.,Now imagine someone as twisted as me,trying to build a house.,(Laughter),That's what my husband and I are doing right now.,And so, we wanted to know, how green could we be?,And there's a thousand and one articles out there,telling us how to make all these green trade-offs.,And they are just as suspect,in telling us to optimize these little things around the edges,and missing the elephant in the living room.,Now, the average house,has about 300 megawatt hours,of embodied energy in it;,this is the energy it takes to make it --,millions and millions of paper towels. 
 We wanted to know how much better we could do.,And so, like many people,,we start with a house on a lot,,and I'm going to show you a typical construction on the top,and what we're doing on the bottom.,So first, we demolish it.,It takes some energy, but if you deconstruct it --,you take it all apart, you use the bits --,you can get some of that energy back.,We then dug a big hole,to put in a rainwater catchment tank,to take our yard water independent.,And then we poured a big foundation,for passive solar.,Now, you can reduce the embodied energy,by about 25 percent,by using high fly ash concrete.,We then put in framing.,And so this is framing -- lumber,,composite materials --,and it's kind of hard to get the embodied energy out of that,,but it can be a sustainable resource,if you use FSC-certified lumber. 
 We then go on to,the first thing that was very surprising.,If we put aluminum windows in this house,,we would double the energy use right there.,Now, PVC is a little bit better,,but still not as good as the wood that we chose.,We then put in plumbing,,electrical and HVAC,,and insulate.,Now, spray foam is an excellent insulator -- it fills in all the cracks --,but it is pretty high embodied energy,,and, sprayed-in cellulose or blue jeans,is a much lower energy alternative to that.,We also used straw bale,infill for our library,,which has zero embodied energy.,When it comes time to sheetrock,,if you use EcoRock it's about a quarter,of the embodied energy of standard sheetrock. 
 And then you get to the finishes,,the subject of all of those "go green" articles,,and on the scale of a house,they almost make no difference at all.,And yet, all the press is focused on that.,Except for flooring.,If you put carpeting in your house,,it's about a tenth of the embodied energy of the entire house,,unless you use concrete or wood,for a much lower embodied energy.,So now we add in the final construction energy, we add it all up,,and we've built a house for less than half,of the typical embodied energy for building a house like this. 
 But before we pat ourselves,too much on the back,,we have poured 151 megawatt hours,of energy into constructing this house,when there was a house there before.,And so the question is:,How could we make that back?,And so if I run my new energy-efficient house forward,,compared with the old, non-energy-efficient house,,we make it back in about six years.,Now, I probably would have upgraded the old house,to be more energy-efficient,,and in that case,,it would take me more about 20 years to break even.,Now, if I hadn't paid attention to embodied energy,,it would have taken us,over 50 years to break even,compared to the upgraded house.,So what does this mean?,On the scale of my portion of the house,,this is equivalent to about,as much as I drive in a year,,it's about five times as much,as if I went entirely vegetarian.,But my elephant in the living room flies.,Clearly, I need to walk home from TED.,But all the calculations,for embodied energy are on the blog. 
 And, remember, it's sometimes the things that you are not expecting,to be the biggest changes that are. 
 Thank you. (Applause)Most of the talks,that you've heard in the last several fabulous days,have been from people who have the characteristic,that they have thought about something,,they are experts, they know what's going on.,All of you know about the topic,that I'm supposed to talk about.,That is, you know what simplicity is,,you know what complexity is.,The trouble is, I don't.,And what I'm going to do is share with you,my ignorance on this subject. 
 I want you to read this,,because we're going to come back to it in a moment.,The quote is from,the fabled Potter Stewart,opinion on pornography.,And let me just read it,,the important details here:,"Shorthand description, ['hardcore pornography'];,and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly defining it.,But I know it when I see it.",I'm going to come back to that in a moment. 
 So, what is simplicity?,It's good to start with some examples.,A coffee cup -- we don't think about coffee cups,,but it's much more interesting than one might think --,a coffee cup is a device,,which has a container and a handle.,The handle enables you to hold it,when the container is filled with hot liquid.,Why is that important?,Well, it enables you to drink coffee.,But also, by the way, the coffee is hot,,the liquid is sterile;,you're not likely to get cholera that way.,So the coffee cup, or the cup with a handle,,is one of the tools used by society,to maintain public health.,Scissors are your clothes,,glasses enable you to see things,and keep you from being eaten by cheetahs,or run down by automobiles,,and books are, after all, your education. 
 But there's another class of simple things,,which are also very important.,Simple in function,,but not at all simple in how they're constructed.,And the two here are just examples.,One is the cellphone, which we use every day.,And it rests on a complexity,,which has some characteristics,very different from those that my friend,Benoit Mandelbrot discussed,,but are very interesting.,And the other, of course, is a birth control pill,,which, in a very simple way,,fundamentally changed the structure of society,by changing the role of women in it,by providing to them,the opportunity to make reproductive choices. 
 So, there are two ways of thinking about this word, I think.,And here I've corrupted,the Potter Stewart quotation,by saying that we can think about something --,which spans all the way from scissors,to the cell phone,,Internet and birth control pills --,by saying that they're simple,,the functions are simple,,and we recognize what that simplicity is,when we see it. 
 Or there may be another way of doing it,,which is to think about the problem in terms of what --,if you associate with moral philosophers --,is called the teapot problem.,The teapot problem I'll pose this way.,Suppose you see a teapot,,and the teapot is,filled with hot water.,And you then ask the question:,Why is the water hot?,And that's a simple question.,It's like, what is simplicity?,One answer would be:,because the kinetic energy of the water molecules is high,and they bounce against things rapidly --,that's a kind of physical science argument.,A second argument would be:,because it was sitting on a stove with the flame on --,that's an historical argument.,A third is that I wanted hot water,for tea --,that's an intentional argument.,And, since this is coming from a moral philosopher,,the fourth would be that it's part of God's plan for the universe.,All of these are possibilities. 
 The point is that you get into trouble,when you ask a single question,with a single box for an answer,,in which that single question actually is many questions,with quite different meanings,,but with the same words.,Asking, "What is simplicity?" I think falls in that category.,What is the state of science?,And, interestingly, complexity,is very highly evolved.,We have a lot of interesting information,about what complexity is.,Simplicity, for reasons,that are a little bit obscure,,is almost not pursued,,at least in the academic world. 
 We academics -- I am an academic --,we love complexity.,You can write papers about complexity,,and the nice thing about complexity is,it's fundamentally intractable in many ways,,so you're not responsible for outcomes. (Laughter),Simplicity -- all of you really would like,your Waring Blender in the morning,to make whatever a Waring Blender does,,but not explode or play Beethoven.,You're not interested in the limits of these things.,So what one is interested in,has a lot to do with the rewards of the system.,And there's a lot of rewards in thinking,about complexity and emergence,,not so much in thinking about simplicity.,One of the things I want to do,is to help you with a very important task --,which you may not know that you have very often --,which is to understand,how to sit next to a physicist at a dinner party,and have a conversation. (Laughter),And the words that I would like you to focus on,are complexity and emergence,,because these will enable you to start the conversation,and then daydream about other things. 
 (Laughter) 
 All right, what is complexity in this view of things,,and what is emergence?,We have, actually, a pretty good working definition of complexity.,It is a system, like traffic,,which has components.,The components interact with one another.,These are cars and drivers. They dissipate energy.,It turns out that, whenever you have that system,,weird stuff happens,,and you in Los Angeles,probably know this better than anyone.,Here's another example,,which I put up because,it's an example of really important current science.,You can't possibly read that. It's not intended that you read it,,but that's a tiny part,of the chemical reactions going on,in each of your cells at any given moment.,And it's like the traffic that you see.,The amazing thing about the cell is that,it actually does maintain a fairly stable,working relationship with other cells,,but we don't know why.,Anyone who tells you that we understand life,,walk away. 
 And let me reduce this to the simplest level.,We've heard from Bill Gates recently.,All of us, to some extent, study,this thing called a Bill Gates.,Terrific. You learn everything you can about that.,And then there's another kind of thing that you might study,,and you study that hard.,That's a Bono, this is a Bono.,But then, if you know everything you can know about those two things,,and you put them together,,what can you say about this combination?,The answer is, not a lot.,And that's complexity.,Now, imagine building that up to a city, or to a society,,and you've got, obviously, an interesting problem. 
 All right, so let me give you an example,of simplicity,of a particular kind.,And I want to introduce a word,that I think is very useful,,which is stacking.,And I'm going to use stacking for a kind of simplicity,that has the characteristic,that it is so simple,and so reliable,that I can build things with it.,Or I'm going to use simple to mean,reliable, predictable, repeatable.,And I'm going to use as an example the Internet,,because it's a particularly good example,of stacked simplicity.,We call it a complex system, which it is,,but it's also something else. 
 The Internet starts with mathematics,,it starts with binary.,And if you look at the list of things on the bottom,,we are familiar with the Arabic numbers,one to 10 and so on.,In binary, one is 0001,,seven is 0111.,The question is: Why is binary,simpler than Arabic?,And the answer is, simply,,that if I hold up three fingers, you can count that easily,,but if I hold up this,,it's sort of hard to say that I just did seven.,The virtue of binary is that it's the simplest possible way,of representing numbers.,Anything else is more complicated.,You can catch errors with it,,it's unambiguous in its reading,,there are lots of good things about binary.,So it is very, very simple,once you learn how to read it.,Now, if you like to represent,this zero and one of binary,,you need a device.,And think of things in your life,that are binary,,one of them is light switches.,They can be on and off. That's binary. 
 Now wall switches, we all know, fail.,But our friends who are condensed matter physicists,managed to come up, some 50 years ago,,with a very nice device, shown under that bell jar,,which is a transistor.,A transistor is nothing more than a wall switch.,It turns things on and off,,but it does so without moving parts,and it doesn't fail, basically, for a very long period of time.,So the second layer of simplicity,was the transistor in the Internet.,So, since the transistor is so simple,,you can put lots of them together.,And you put lots of them together and you come with,something called integrated circuits.,And a current integrated circuit,might have in each one of these chips,something like a billion transistors,,all of which have to work perfectly every time.,So that's the next layer of simplicity,,and, in fact, integrated circuits,are really simple in the sense that they,,in general, work really well. 
 With integrated circuits, you can build cellphones.,You all are accustomed to having your cellphones work,the large majority of the time.,In Boston ... Boston is a little bit like Namibia,in its cell phone coverage, (Laughter),so that we're not accustomed to that all the time,,but some of the time.,But, in fact, if you have cell phones,,you can now go to this nice lady,who's somewhere like Namibia,,and who is extremely happy with the fact,that although she does not have,an master's degree in,electrical engineering from MIT,,she's nonetheless able to hack her cell phone,to get power in some funny way.,And from that comes the Internet.,And this is a map of bitflows across the continent.,The two blobs that are light in the middle there,are the United States and Europe. 
 And then back to simplicity again.,So here we have what I think is one of the great ideas,,which is Google.,Which, in this simple portal,makes the claim,that it makes accessible,all of the world's information.,But the point is that,that extraordinary simple idea,rests on layers of simplicity,each compounded into a complexity,that is itself simple,,in the sense that it is completely reliable. 
 All right, let me then finish off,with four general statements,,an example and two aphorisms.,The characteristics, which I think,are useful to think about for simple things:,First, they are predictable.,Their behavior is predictable.,Now, one of the nice characteristics,of simple things,is you know what it's going to do, in general.,So simplicity and predictability,are characteristics of simple things.,The second is, and this is a real world statement,,they're cheap.,If you have things that are cheap enough,,people will find uses for them,,even if they seem very primitive.,So, for example, stones.,You can build cathedrals out of stones,,you just have to know what it does.,You carve them in blocks and then you,pile them on top of one another,,and they support weight. 
 So there has to be function, the function has to be predictable,and the cost has to be low.,What that means is,that you have to have a high performance,or value for cost.,And then I would propose,as this last component,that they serve, or have the potential to serve,,as building blocks.,That is, you can stack them.,And stack can mean this way, or it can mean this way,,or it can mean in some arbitrary n-dimensional space.,But if you have something that has a function,,and it's really cheap,,people will find new ways of putting it together,to make new things.,Cheap, functional, reliable things,unleash the creativity of people,who then build stuff that you could not imagine.,There's no way of predicting the Internet,based on the first transistor.,It just is not possible.,So these are the components. 
 Now, the example,is something that I want to give you,from the work that we ourselves do.,We are very interested in,delivering health care in the developing world,,and one of the things that we wish to do in this particular business,is to find a way of doing medical diagnosis,at as close to zero cost,as we can manage.,So, how does one do that?,This is a world in which there's no electricity,,there's no money, there's no medical competence.,And I don't want to spend your time in going through the details,,but in the lower right-hand corner,,you see an example of the kind of thing that we have.,It's a little paper chip.,It has a few things printed on it,using the same technology,that you use for making comic books,,which was the inspiration for this particular idea.,And you put a drop, in this case, of urine at the bottom.,It wicks its way up into these little branches.,You know, no power required.,It turns colors. In this particular case,,you're reading kidney function.,And, since the health care worker,of much of this part of the world,is an 18 year-old with an AK-47,,who happens to be out of work and is willing,to go around and do this sort of thing,,he can take a picture of it with his cellphone,,send the picture back to where there is a doctor,,and the doctor can look at it. 
 So what you've done is to take a technology,,which is available everywhere,,make a device, which is extremely cheap,,and make it in such a fashion,that it is very, very reliable.,If we can pull this off,,if we can build more function,,it will be stackable.,That is to say, if we can make the basic technology,of one or two things work,,it will be applicable to a very, very,large variety of human conditions,,and hence, extendable in both,vertical and horizontal directions.,Part of my interest in this, I have to say,,is that I would like to -- how do I put this politely? --,change the way, or maybe eviscerate,,the capital structure of the U.S. health care system,,which I think is fundamentally broken. 
 So, let me close --,(Applause) 
 Let me close with my two aphorisms.,One of them is from Mr. Einstein,,and he says, "Everything should be made,as simple as possible, but not simpler.",And I think that's a very good way of thinking about the problem.,If you take too much out,of something that's simple, you lose function.,You have to have low cost,,but you also have to have a function.,So you can't make it too simple.,And the second is a design issue,,and it's not directly relevant, but it's a nice statement. 
 This is by de Saint-Exupery.,And he says, "You know you've achieved perfection in design,,not when you have nothing more to add,,but when you have nothing more to take away.",And that certainly is going in the right direction.,So, what I think one can begin to do,with this kind of,cut at the word simplicity,,which doesn't cover Brancusi,,it doesn't answer the question of,why Mondrian is better or worse,or simpler or less simpler than Van Gogh,,and certainly doesn't address the question,of whether Mozart is simpler than Bach. 
 But it does make a point --,which is one which, in a sense,,differentiates the real world of people who make things,,and the world of people who think about things,,which is, there is an intellectual merit,to asking: How do we make things,as simple as we can,,as cheap as we can, as functional as we can,and as freely interconnectable as we can?,If we make that kind of simplicity in our technology,and then give it to you guys,,you can go off and do all kinds of fabulous things with it. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: Quick question.,So can you picture,that a science of simplicity,might get to the point where,you could look out at various systems --,say a financial system or a legal system, health system -- and say,,"That has got to the point of danger,or dysfunctionality for the following reasons,,and this is how we might simplify it"? 
 George Whitesides: Yes, I think you could. Because if you look,at the components from which the system is made,and examine their fragility, or their stability,,you can probably build a kind of risk assessment based on that basis. 
 CA: Have you started to do that?,I mean, with the health system, you got a sort of,radical solution on the cost side,,but in terms of the system itself? 
 GW: Well, no.,How do I put that simply? No. 
 CA: That was a simple, powerful answer. GW: Yes. 
 CA: So, in terms of,that diagnostic technology that you've got,,where is that, and when do you see that,maybe getting rolled out to scale. 
 GW: That's coming out soon. I mean, the systems work,,and we have to find out how to manufacture them and do things of this kind,,but the basic technology works. 
 CA: You've got a company set up to ...,GW: A foundation, a foundation. Not-for-profit. 
 CA: All right. Well, thank you so much for your talk. Thank you. (Applause)I've always been interested in,the relationship of formal structures and human behavior.,If you build a wide road out to the outskirts of town, people will move there.,Well, law is also a powerful driver,of human behavior.,And what I'd like to discuss today,is the need to overhaul and simplify the law,to release the energy and passion,of Americans, so that we can begin,to address the challenges of our society. 
 You might have noticed that law has grown,progressively denser in your lives over the last decade or two.,If you run a business, it's hard to do much of anything,without calling your general counsel.,Indeed, there is this phenomenon now,where the general counsels are becoming the CEOs.,It's a little bit like the Invasion Of The Body Snatchers.,You need a lawyer to run the company,,because there's so much law.,But it's not just business that's affected by this,,it's actually pressed down into the daily activities,of ordinary people. 
 A couple of years ago I was hiking near Cody, Wyoming.,It was in a grizzly bear preserve,,although no one told me that before we went.,And our guide was a local science teacher.,She was wholly unconcerned about the bears,,but she was terrified of lawyers.,The stories started pouring out.,She'd just been involved in an episode where a parent,had threatened to sue the school,because she lowered the grade of the student by 10 percent,when he turned the paper in late.,The principal didn't want to stand up to the parent,because he didn't want to get dragged into some legal proceedings.,So, she had to go to meeting after meeting, same arguments made,over and over again.,After 30 days of sleepless nights, she finally capitulated,and raised the grade.,She said, "Life's too short, I just can't keep going with this." 
 About the same time, she was going to take two students to a leadership conference,in Laramie, which is a couple of hours away,,and she was going to drive them in her car,,but the school said, "No, you can't drive them in the car,for liability reasons.,You have to go in a school bus.",So, they provided a bus that held 60 people,and drove the three of them back and forth,several hours to Laramie. 
 Her husband is also a science teacher,,and he takes his biology class on a hike,in the nearby national park.,But he was told he couldn't go on the hike this year,because one of the students in the class was disabled,,so the other 25 students didn't get to go on the hike either.,At the end of this day I could have filled a book,just with stories about law,from this one teacher. 
 Now, we've been taught to believe that law,is the foundation of freedom.,But somehow or another, in the last couple of decades,,the land of the free has become a legal minefield.,It's really changed our lives in ways,that are sort of imperceptible;,and yet, when you pull back, you see it all the time.,It's changed the way we talk. I was talking to a,pediatrician friend,in North Carolina. He said,,"Well you know, I don't deal with patients the same way anymore.,You wouldn't want to say something off-the-cuff,that might be used against you.",This is a doctor, whose life is caring for people.,My own law firm has a list of questions,that I'm not allowed to ask,when interviewing candidates,,such as the sinister question,,bulging with hidden motives and innuendo,,"Where are you from?",(Laughter) 
 Now for 20 years, tort reformers have been sounding the alarm,that lawsuits are out of control.,And we read every once in while,about these crazy lawsuits, like the guy,in the District of Columbia who sued his dry cleaners for 54 million dollars,because they lost his pair of pants.,The case went on for two years; I think he's still appealing the case. 
 But the reality is, these crazy cases,are relatively rare. They don't usually win.,And the total of direct tort cost,in this country is about two percent,,which is twice as much as in other countries,but, as taxes go, hardly crippling.,But the direct costs are really only the tip of the iceberg. 
 What's happened here, again,,almost without our knowing,,is our culture has changed.,People no longer feel free,to act on their best judgment.,So, what do we do about it?,We certainly don't want to give up the rights,,when people do something wrong, to seek redress in the courts.,We need regulation to make sure,people don't pollute and such.,We lack even a vocabulary to deal with,this problem,,and that's because we have the wrong frame of reference. 
 We've been trained to think that the way to look at every dispute,,every issue, is a matter of kind of individual rights.,And so we peer through a legal microscope, and look at everything.,Is it possible that there are extenuating circumstances,that explain why Johnny,turned his paper in late in Cody, Wyoming?,Is it possible that the doctor,might have done something differently when the sick person gets sicker?,And of course the hindsight bias is perfect.,There's always a different scenario that you can sketch out,where it's possible that something could have been done differently. 
 And yet, we've been trained to squint into this legal microscope,,hoping that we can judge any dispute,against the standard of a perfect society,,where everyone will agree what's fair,,and where accidents will be extinct,,risk will be no more.,Of course, this is Utopia;,it's a formula for paralysis, not freedom.,It's not the basis of the rule of law,,it's not the basis of a free society.,So, now I have the first of four propositions,I'm going to leave with you about how you simplify the law:,You've got to judge law mainly,by its effect on the broader society,,not individual disputes.,Absolutely vital. 
 So, let's pull back from the anecdotes for a second,and look at our society from high above.,Is it working?,What does the macro-data show us?,Well, the healthcare system has been transformed:,a culture pervaded with defensiveness,,universal distrust of the system of justice,,universal practice of defensive medicine.,It's very hard to measure,because there are mixed motives.,Doctors can make more on ordering tests sometimes,,and also they no longer even know what's right or wrong.,But reliable estimates,range between 60 billion and,200 billion dollars per year.,That's enough to provide care to all the people,in America who don't have it. 
 The trial lawyers say, "Well, this legal fear,makes doctors practice better medicine.",Well that's been studied too, by the Institute of Medicine,and others. Turns out that's not the case.,The fear has chilled professional interaction,so thousands of tragic errors occur,because doctors are afraid,to speak up: "Are you sure that's the right dosage?",Because they're not sure,,and they don't want to take legal responsibility. 
 Let's go to schools.,As we saw with the teacher in Cody, Wyoming,,she seems to be affected by the law.,Well it turns out the schools are literally drowning in law.,You could have a separate section of a law library,around each of the following legal concepts:,due process, special education,,no child left behind,,zero tolerance, work rules ...,it goes on. We did a study,of all the rules that affect one school,in New York. The Board of Ed. had no idea.,Tens of thousands of discreet rules,,60 steps to suspend a student from school:,It's a formula for paralysis.,What's the effect of that? One is a decline in order. 
 Again, studies have shown,it's directly attributable,to the rise of due process.,Public agenda did a survey for us a couple of years ago,where they found that 43 percent of the high school teachers in America,say that they spend at least half of their time,maintaining order in the classroom.,That means those students are getting half the learning,they're supposed to, because if one child is disrupting the class,no one can learn.,And what happens when the teacher tries to assert order?,They're threatened with a legal claim.,We also surveyed that. Seventy-eight percent of the middle and high school teachers,in America have been threatened by their students,with violating their rights, with lawsuits,by their students. They are threatening, their students.,It's not that they usually sue,,it's not that they would win, but it's an,indication of the corrosion of authority. 
 And how has this system of law worked for government?,It doesn't seem to be working very well does it?,Neither in Sacramento nor in Washington.,The other day at the State of the Union speech,,President Obama said,,and I think we could all agree with this goal,,"From the first railroads to the interstate highway system,,our nation has always been the first to compete.,There is no reason Europe or China should have the fastest trains.",Well, actually there is a reason:,Environmental review has evolved into a process,of no pebble left unturned,for any major project taking the better part of a decade,,then followed by years of litigation,by anybody who doesn't like the project. 
 Then, just staying above the Earth for one more second,,people are acting like idiots,,(Laughter),all across the country.,(Applause),Idiots. A couple of years ago,,Broward County, Florida, banned running at recess.,(Laughter),That means all the boys are going to be ADD.,I mean it's just absolutely,a formula for failure. 
 My favorite, though, are all the warning labels.,"Caution: Contents are hot,",on billions of coffee cups.,Archeologists will dig us up in a thousand years,and they won't know about defensive medicine and stuff,,but they'll see all these labels, "Contents are extremely hot.",They'll think it was some kind of aphrodisiac.,That's the only explanation. Because why,would you have to tell people that something was actually hot?,My favorite warning was one on a five-inch fishing lure.,I grew up in the South and whiled away the summers fishing.,Five-inch fishing lure, it's a big fishing lure,,with a three pronged hook in the back,,and outside it said, "Harmful if swallowed.",(Laughter) 
 So, none of these people,are doing what they think is right.,And why not? They don't trust the law. Why don't they trust the law?,Because it gives us the worst of both worlds:,It's random -- anybody can sue for almost anything,and take it to a jury, not even an effort at consistency --,and it's also too detailed.,In the areas that are regulated, there are so many rules,no human could possibly know it.,Well how do you fix it? We could spend 10,000 lifetimes,trying to prune this legal jungle.,But the challenge here is not one of just,amending the law,,because the hurdle for success is trust. 
 People -- for law to be the platform for freedom,,people have to trust it.,So, that's my second proposition:,Trust is an essential condition,to a free society.,Life is complicated enough without legal fear.,But law is different than other kinds of uncertainties,,because it carries with it the power of state.,And so the state can come in.,It actually changes the way people think.,It's like having a little lawyer on your shoulders,all day long, whispering in your ear,,"Could that go wrong? Might that go wrong?",It drives people from the smart part of the brain --,that dark, deep well of the subconscious,,where instincts and experience,,and all the other factors of creativity,and good judgment are --,it drives us to the thin veneer of conscious logic. 
 Pretty soon the doctor's saying, "Well, I doubt,if that headache could be a tumor, but who would protect me,if it were? So maybe I'll just order the MRI.",Then you've wasted 200 billion dollars in unnecessary tests.,If you make people self-conscious,about their judgments, studies show,you will make them make worse judgments.,If you tell the pianist to think about how she's hitting the notes,when she's playing the piece, she can't play the piece.,Self-consciousness is the enemy of accomplishment.,Edison stated it best. He said,,"Hell, we ain't got no rules around here,,we're trying to accomplish something.",(Laughter) 
 So, how do you restore trust?,Tweaking the law's clearly not good enough,,and tort reform, which is a great idea,,lowers your cost if you're a businessperson,,but it's like a Band-Aid on this gaping wound of distrust.,States with extensive tort reform,still suffer all these pathologies.,So, what's needed is not just to limit claims,,but actually create a dry ground of freedom.,It turns out that freedom actually has a formal structure.,And it is this:,Law sets boundaries,,and on one side of those boundaries are all the things,you can't do or must do --,you can't steal, you've got to pay your taxes --,but those same boundaries are supposed to define,and protect a dry ground of freedom. 
 Isaiah Berlin put it this way:,"Law sets frontiers, not artificially drawn,,within which men shall be inviolable.",We've forgotten that second part.,Those dikes have burst. People wade through law,all day long.,So, what's needed now,is to rebuild these boundaries.,And it's especially important to rebuild them,for lawsuits.,Because what people can sue for establishes the boundaries,for everybody else's freedom.,If someone brings a lawsuit over, "A kid fell off the seesaw,",it doesn't matter what happens in the lawsuit,,all the seesaws will disappear.,Because no one will want to take the risk of a lawsuit.,And that's what's happened. There are no seesaws, jungle gyms,,merry-go-rounds, climbing ropes,,nothing that would interest a kid over the age of four,,because there's no risk associated with it. 
 So, how do we rebuild it?,Life is too complex for...,(Applause),Life is too complex for a software program.,All these choices involve value judgments,and social norms, not objective facts.,And so here is the fourth proposition.,This is what we have, the philosophy we have to change to.,And there are two essential elements of it:,We have to simplify the law.,We have to migrate from all this complexity,towards general principles and goals.,The constitution is only 16 pages long.,Worked pretty well for 200 years. 
 Law has to be simple enough,so that people can internalize it,in their daily choices.,If they can't internalize it, they won't trust it.,And how do you make it simple?,Because life is complex,,and here is the hardest and biggest change:,We have to restore the authority,to judges and officials,to interpret and apply the law.,(Applause),We have to rehumanize the law.,To make law simple so that you feel free,,the people in charge have to be free,to use their judgment to interpret and apply the law,in accord with reasonable social norms.,As you're going down, and walking down the sidewalk during the day,,you have to think that if there is a dispute,,there's somebody in society who sees it as their job,to affirmatively protect you,if you're acting reasonably.,That person doesn't exist today. 
 This is the hardest hurdle.,It's actually not very hard. Ninety-eight percent of cases, this is a piece of cake.,Maybe you've got a claim in small claims court,for your lost pair of pants for $100,,but not in a court of general jurisdiction for millions of dollars.,Case dismissed without prejudice or refiling in small claims court.,Takes five minutes. That's it,,it's not that hard. 
 But it's a hard hurdle because we got into this legal quicksand,because we woke up in the 1960s,to all these really bad values: racism,,gender discrimination, pollution --,they were bad values. And we wanted to create a legal system,where no one could have bad values anymore.,The problem is, we created a system,where we eliminated the right to have good values.,It doesn't mean that people in authority,can do whatever they want.,They're still bounded by legal goals and principles:,The teacher is accountable to the principal,,the judge is accountable to an appellate court,,the president is accountable to voters.,But the accountability's up the line,judging the decision against the effect on everybody,,not just on the disgruntled person.,You can't run a society by the lowest common denominator.,(Applause) 
 So, what's needed is a basic shift in philosophy.,We can pull the plug on a lot of this stuff if we shift our philosophy.,We've been taught that authority is the enemy of freedom.,It's not true. Authority, in fact,,is essential to freedom.,Law is a human institution;,responsibility is a human institution.,If teachers don't have authority to run the classroom,,to maintain order, everybody's learning suffers.,If the judge doesn't have the authority to toss out unreasonable claims,,then all of us go through the day looking over our shoulders.,If the environmental agency can't decide,that the power lines are good for the environment,,then there's no way to bring the power from the wind farms,to the city.,A free society requires red lights and green lights,,otherwise it soon descends into gridlock.,That's what's happened to America. Look around. 
 What the world needs now,is to restore the authority to make common choices.,It's the only way to get our freedom back,,and it's the only way to release the energy and passion,needed so that we can meet the challenges,of our time. Thank you.,(Applause)Several years ago here at TED, Peter Skillman,introduced a design challenge,called the marshmallow challenge.,And the idea's pretty simple:,Teams of four have to build the tallest free-standing structure,out of 20 sticks of spaghetti,,one yard of tape, one yard of string,and a marshmallow.,The marshmallow has to be on top.,And, though it seems really simple, it's actually pretty hard,because it forces people,to collaborate very quickly.,And so, I thought this was an interesting idea,,and I incorporated it into a design workshop.,And it was a huge success.,And since then, I've conducted,about 70 design workshops across the world,with students and designers and architects,,even the CTOs of the Fortune 50,,and there's something about this exercise,that reveals very deep lessons,about the nature of collaboration,,and I'd like to share some of them with you. 
 So, normally, most people begin,by orienting themselves to the task.,They talk about it, they figure out what it's going to look like,,they jockey for power.,Then they spend some time planning, organizing,,they sketch and they lay out spaghetti.,They spend the majority of their time,assembling the sticks into ever-growing structures.,And then finally, just as they're running out of time,,someone takes out the marshmallow,,and then they gingerly put it on top,,and then they stand back, and -- ta-da! --,they admire their work.,But what really happens, most of the time,,is that the "ta-da" turns into an "uh-oh,",because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure,to buckle and to collapse. 
 So there are a number of people,who have a lot more "uh-oh" moments than others,,and among the worst are recent graduates of business school.,(Laughter),They lie, they cheat, they get distracted,and they produce really lame structures.,And of course there are teams,that have a lot more "ta-da" structures,,and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten.,(Laughter),And it's pretty amazing.,As Peter tells us,,not only do they produce the tallest structures,,but they're the most interesting structures of them all. 
 So the question you want to ask is:,How come? Why? What is it about them?,And Peter likes to say that,none of the kids spend any time,trying to be CEO of Spaghetti, Inc. Right?,They don't spend time jockeying for power.,But there's another reason as well.,And the reason is that business students are trained,to find the single right plan, right?,And then they execute on it.,And then what happens is, when they put the marshmallow on the top,,they run out of time and what happens?,It's a crisis.,Sound familiar? Right.,What kindergarteners do differently,is that they start with the marshmallow,,and they build prototypes, successive prototypes,,always keeping the marshmallow on top,,so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototypes along the way.,Designers recognize this type of collaboration,as the essence of the iterative process.,And with each version, kids get instant feedback,about what works and what doesn't work. 
 So the capacity to play in prototype is really essential,,but let's look at how different teams perform.,So the average for most people is around 20 inches;,business schools students, about half of that;,lawyers, a little better, but not much better than that,,kindergarteners, better than most adults.,Who does the very best?,Architects and engineers, thankfully.,(Laughter),Thirty-nine inches is the tallest structure I've seen.,And why is it? Because they understand triangles,and self-reinforcing geometrical patterns,are the key to building,stable structures.,So CEOs, a little bit better than average,,but here's where it gets interesting.,If you put you put an executive admin. on the team,,they get significantly better.,(Laughter),It's incredible. You know, you look around, you go, "Oh, that team's going to win.",You can just tell beforehand. And why is that?,Because they have special skills,of facilitation.,They manage the process, they understand the process.,And any team who manages,and pays close attention to work,will significantly improve the team's performance.,Specialized skills and facilitation skills,are the combination that leads to strong success.,If you have 10 teams that typically perform,,you'll get maybe six or so that have standing structures. 
 And I tried something interesting.,I thought, let's up the ante, once.,So I offered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the winning team.,So what do you think happened to these design students?,What was the result?,Here's what happened:,Not one team had a standing structure.,If anyone had built, say, a one inch structure,,they would have taken home the prize.,So, isn't that interesting? That high stakes,have a strong impact.,We did the exercise again with the same students.,What do you think happened then?,So now they understand the value of prototyping.,So the same team went from being the very worst,to being among the very best.,They produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time.,So there's deep lessons for us,about the nature of incentives and success. 
 So, you might ask: Why would anyone,actually spend time writing a marshmallow challenge?,And the reason is, I help create,digital tools and processes,to help teams build cars and video games,and visual effects.,And what the marshmallow challenge does,is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions.,Because, frankly,,every project has its own marshmallow, doesn't it?,The challenge provides a shared experience,,a common language,,a common stance to build the right prototype.,And so, this is the value of the experience,,of this so simple exercise. 
 And those of you who are interested,may want to go to MarshmallowChallenge.com.,It's a blog that you can look at,how to build the marshmallows.,There's step-by-step instructions on this.,There are crazy examples from around the world,of how people tweak and adjust the system.,There's world records that are on this as well. 
 And the fundamental lesson, I believe,,is that design truly is,a contact sport.,It demands that we bring all of our senses to the task,,and that we apply the very best of our thinking,,our feeling and our doing,to the challenge that we have at hand.,And sometimes, a little prototype of this experience,is all that it takes to turn us,from an "uh-oh" moment to a "ta-da" moment.,And that can make a big difference. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Sadly,,in the next 18 minutes when I do our chat,,four Americans that are alive,will be dead throughnthe food that they eat. 
 My name's Jamie Oliver.,I'm 34 years old.,I'm from Essex in England,and for the last seven years,I've worked fairly tirelesslynto save lives in my own way.,I'm not a doctor;,I'm a chef,,I don't have expensive equipment,or medicine.,I use information, education. 
 I profoundly believenthat the power of food,has a primal place in our homes,that binds us to the best bits of life.,We have an awful, awful reality right now.,America, you're at the top of your game.,This is one of the most unhealthyncountries in the world. 
 Can I please just see a raise of hands,for how many of you havenchildren in this room today?,Put your hands up.,You can continue to put your hands up,naunties and uncles as well.,Most of you. OK.,We, the adults of the lastnfour generations,,have blessed our children with the destiny,of a shorter lifespannthan their own parents.,Your child will live a lifenten years younger than you,because of the landscape of foodnthat we've built around them.,Two-thirds of this room,,today, in America, are statisticallynoverweight or obese.,You lot, you're all right,,but we'll get you eventually, don't worry. 
 (Laughter) 
 The statistics of bad health are clear,,very clear.,We spend our lives being paranoidnabout death, murder, homicide,,you name it; it's on the front pagenof every paper, CNN.,Look at homicidenat the bottom, for God's sake.,Right? 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Every single one of those in the rednis a diet-related disease.,Any doctor, any specialistnwill tell you that.,Fact: diet-related diseasenis the biggest killer,in the United States,nright now, here today.,This is a global problem.,It's a catastrophe.,It's sweeping the world.,England is right behind you, as usual. 
 (Laughter) 
 I know they were close,nbut not that close.,We need a revolution.,Mexico, Australia, Germany,,India, China,,all have massive problemsnof obesity and bad health.,Think about smoking.,It costs way less than obesity now.,Obesity costs you Americansn10 percent of your health-care bills,,150 billion dollars a year.,In 10 years, it's set to double:,300 billion dollars a year.,Let's be honest, guys,nyou haven't got that cash. 
 (Laughter) 
 I came here to start a food revolutionnthat I so profoundly believe in.,We need it. The time is now.,We're in a tipping-point moment.,I've been doing this for seven years.,I've been trying in Americanfor seven years.,Now is the time when it's ripe --nripe for the picking.,I went to the eye of the storm.,I went to West Virginia,nthe most unhealthy state in America.,Or it was last year.,We've got a new one this year,nbut we'll work on that next season. 
 (Laughter) 
 Huntington, West Virginia. Beautiful town.,I wanted to put heart and soul and people,,your public,,around the statisticsnthat we've become so used to.,I want to introduce younto some of the people that I care about:,your public, your children.,I want to show a picturenof my friend Brittany.,She's 16 years old.,She's got six years to live,because of the food that she's eaten.,She's the third generation of Americans,that hasn't grown upnwithin a food environment,where they've been taughtnto cook at home or in school,,or her mom, or her mom's mom.,She has six years to live.,She's eating her liver to death. 
 Stacy, the Edwards family.,This is a normal family, guys.,Stacy does her best,nbut she's third-generation as well;,she was never taught to cooknat home or at school.,The family's obese.,Justin here, 12 years old,nhe's 350 pounds.,He gets bullied, for God's sake.,The daughter there, Katie,nshe's four years old.,She's obese before she even getsnto primary school.,Marissa, she's all right,nshe's one of your lot.,But you know what?,Her father, who was obese,ndied in her arms,,And then the secondnmost important man in her life,,her uncle, died of obesity,,and now her step-dad is obese.,You see, the thing is,,obesity and diet-related disease,doesn't just hurt the people that have it;,it's all of their friends, families,nbrothers, sisters. 
 Pastor Steve:,an inspirational man,,one of my early alliesnin Huntington, West Virginia.,He's at the sharp knife-edgenof this problem.,He has to bury the people, OK?,And he's fed up with it.,He's fed up with burying his friends,nhis family, his community.,Come winter, three timesnas many people die.,He's sick of it.,This is preventable disease.nWaste of life.,By the way, this isnwhat they get buried in.,We're not geared up to do this.,Can't even get them out the door,nand I'm being serious.,Can't even get them there. Forklift. 
 OK, I see it as a triangle, OK?,This is our landscape of food.,I need you to understand it.,You've probably heard all this before.,Over the last 30 years,,what's happened that's rippednthe heart out of this country?,Let's be frank and honest.,Well, modern-day life. 
 Let's start with the Main Street.,Fast food has taken overnthe whole country; we know that.,The big brands arensome of the most important powers,,powerful powers, in this country. 
 (Sighs) 
 Supermarkets as well.,Big companies. Big companies.,Thirty years ago, most of the food,was largely local and largely fresh.,Now it's largely processednand full of all sorts of additives,,extra ingredients,nand you know the rest of the story.,Portion size is obviouslyna massive, massive problem.,Labeling is a massive problem.,The labeling in this countrynis a disgrace.,The industry wantsnto self-police themselves.,What, in this kind of climate?nThey don't deserve it.,How can you say something is low-fatnwhen it's full of so much sugar? 
 Home.,The biggest problem with the home,is that used to be the heartnof passing on food culture,,what made our society.,That is not happening anymore.,And you know, as we gonto work and as life changes,,and as life always evolves,,we kind of havento look at it holistically --,step back for a moment,nand re-address the balance.,It hasn't happened for 30 years, OK?,I want to show you a situation,that is very normal right now;nthe Edwards family. 
 (Video) Jamie Oliver: Let's have a talk.,This stuff goes through younand your family's body every week.,And I need you to know,that this is going to killnyour children early.,How are you feeling? 
 Stacy: Just feeling really sadnand depressed right now.,But, you know, I wantnmy kids to succeed in life,and this isn't going to get them there.,But I'm killing them. 
 JO: Yes you are. You are.,But we can stop that.,Normal.,Let's get on schools,,something that I'm fairly muchna specialist in.,OK, school.,What is school? Who invented it?nWhat's the purpose of school?,School was always inventednto arm us with the tools,to make us creative, do wonderful things,,make us earn a living, etc., etc.,You know, it's been kind of in this sortnof tight box for a long, long time, OK?,But we haven't really evolved it,to deal with the healthncatastrophes of America, OK?,School food is something,that most kids --n31 million a day, actually --,have twice a day, more than often,nbreakfast and lunch,,180 days of the year.,So you could say that schoolnfood is quite important, really,,judging the circumstances. 
 (Laughter) 
 Before I crack into my rant,,which I'm sure you're waiting for -- 
 (Laughter) 
 I need to say one thing,nand it's so important,in, hopefully, the magicnthat happens and unfolds,in the next three months.,The lunch ladies,nthe lunch cooks of America --,I offer myself as their ambassador.,I'm not slagging them off.,They're doing the best they can do.,They're doing their best.,But they're doing what they're told,,and what they're beingntold to do is wrong.,The system is highly run by accountants;,there's not enough, or any,nfood-knowledgeable people in the business.,There's a problem:,If you're not a food expert,nand you've got tight budgets,and it's getting tighter,nthen you can't be creative,,you can't duck and divenand write different things around things.,If you're an accountant, and a box-ticker,,the only thing you can donin these circumstances,is buy cheaper shit. 
 Now, the reality is,,the food that your kids getnevery day is fast food,,it's highly processed,,there's not enoughnfresh food in there at all.,You know, the amountnof additives, E numbers,,ingredients you wouldn't believe --,there's not enough veggies at all.,French fries are considered a vegetable.,Pizza for breakfast.nThey don't even get crockery.,Knives and forks?nNo, they're too dangerous.,They have scissors in the classroom,,but knives and forks? No.,And the way I look at it is:,If you don't have knivesnand forks in your school,,you're purely endorsing,,from a state level, fast food,nbecause it's handheld.,And yes, by the way, it is fast food:,It's sloppy Joes, it's burgers,,it's wieners, it's pizzas,nit's all of that stuff. 
 (Sighs) 
 Ten percent of what we spendnon health care, as I said earlier,,is on obesity, and it's going to double.,We're not teaching our kids.,There's no statutory rightnto teach kids about food,,elementary or secondary school, OK?,We don't teach kids about food, right?,And this is a little clipnfrom an elementary school,,which is very common in England. 
 (Video) Who knows what this is? 
 Child: Potatoes. 
 Jamie Oliver: Potato?nSo, you think these are potatoes?,Do you know what that is?,Do you know what that is? 
 Child: Broccoli? 
 JO: What about this? Our good old friend. 
 Child: Celery. 
 JO: No. What do you think this is? 
 Child: Onion.nJO: Onion? No. 
 JO: Immediately younget a really clear sense,of "Do the kids know anythingnabout where food comes from?",Who knows what that is? Child: Uh, pear? 
 JO: What do you think this is?nChild: I don't know. 
 JO: If the kids don't know what stuff is,,then they will never eat it. 
 (Laughter) 
 JO: Normal. England and America,,England and America.,Guess what fixed that.,Two one-hour sessions.,We've got to start teaching our kidsnabout food in schools, period. 
 (Applause) 
 I want to tell you about something,that kind of epitomizes the troublenthat we're in, guys, OK?,I want to talk about somethingnso basic as milk.,Every kid has the right to milk at school.,Your kids will be having milknat school, breakfast and lunch, right?,They'll be having two bottles, OK?,And most kids do.,But milk ain't good enough anymore.,Don't get me wrong, I support milk --,but someone at the milk board,probably paid a lot of moneynfor some geezer to work out,that if you put loads of flavorings,,colorings and sugar in milk,,more kids will drink it.,Yeah. 
 Obviously now that's going to catch on,the apple board is going to work out,that if they make toffee applesnthey'll eat more as well.,Do you know what I mean?,For me, there isn't any neednto flavor the milk.,Okay? There's sugar in everything.,I know the ins and outsnof those ingredients.,It's in everything.,Even the milk hasn't escapednthe kind of modern-day problems.,There's our milk. There's our carton.,In that is nearly as much sugarnas one of your favorite cans of fizzy pop,,and they are having two a day.,So, let me just show you.,We've got one kid, here --,having, you know,neight tablespoons of sugar a day.,You know, there's your week.,There's your month.,And I've taken the liberty of putting in,just the five yearsnof elementary school sugar,,just from milk.,Now, I don't know about you guys,,but judging the circumstances, right,,any judge in the whole world,,would look at the statisticsnand the evidence,,and they would find any governmentnof old guilty of child abuse.,That's my belief. 
 (Applause) 
 (Applause ends) 
 Now, if I came up here, and I wishnI could come up here today,and hang a cure for AIDS or cancer,,you'd be fightingnand scrambling to get to me.,This, all this bad news, is preventable.,That's the good news.,It's very, very preventable.,So, let's just think about,nwe got a problem here,,we need to reboot.,Okay so, in my world,nwhat do we need to do?,Here is the thing, right,,it cannot just come from one source.,To reboot and make real tangible change,,real change, so that I could look younin the white of the eyes,and say, "In 10 years' time,,the history of your children's lives,,happiness -- and let's not forget,nyou're clever if you eat well,,you know you're going to live longer --,all of that stuff,nit will look different. OK?" 
 So, supermarkets.,Where else do you shop so religiously?,Week in, week out.,How much money do you spend,nin your life, in a supermarket?,Love them.,They just sell us what we want. All right.,They owe us to put a food ambassadornin every major supermarket.,They need to help us shop.,They need to show us how to cooknquick, tasty, seasonal meals,for people that are busy.,This is not expensive.,It is done in some, and it needsnto be done across the board,in America soon, and quick.,The big brands, you know, the food brands,,need to put food educationnat the heart of their businesses.,I know, easier said than done.,It's the future. It's the only way. 
 Fast food.,With the fast-food industry,you know, it's very competitive.,I've had loadsnof secret papers and dealings,with fast food restaurants.,I know how they do it.,I mean, basically they've weaned us on,to these hits of sugar,nsalt and fat, and x, y, and z,,and everyone loves them, right?,So, these guys are goingnto be part of the solution.,But we need to get the government to work,with all of the fast food purveyorsnand the restaurant industry,,and over a five, six, seven year period,wean of us off the extreme amounts,of fat, sugar and all the othernnon-food ingredients. 
 Now, also, back to the sort of big brands:,labeling, I said earlier,nis an absolute farce,and has got to be sorted.,OK, school.,Obviously, in schools, we owe it to them,to make sure those 180 days of the year,,from that little precious age of four,,until 18, 20, 24, whatever,,they need to be cooked proper, fresh food,from local growers on site, OK?,There needs to be a newnstandard of fresh, proper food,for your children, yeah? 
 (Applause) 
 Under the circumstances,nit's profoundly important,that every singlenAmerican child leaves school,knowing how to cook 10 recipes,that will save their life.,Life skills. 
 (Applause) 
 That means that they can benstudents, young parents,,and be able to sort of duck and divenaround the basics of cooking,,no matter what recession hitsnthem next time.,If you can cook,nrecession money doesn't matter.,If you can cook, time doesn't matter.,The workplace, we haven'tnreally talked about it.,You know, it's now timenfor corporate responsibility,to really look at what they feednor make available to their staff.,The staff are the moms and dadsnof America's children.,Marissa, her father died in her hand,,I think she'd be quite happy,if corporate America could startnfeeding their staff properly.,Definitely they shouldn't be left out.,Let's go back to the home. 
 Now, look, if we donall this stuff, and we can,,it's so achievable.,You can care and be commercial.,Absolutely.,But the home needs to start passing onncooking again, for sure.,For sure, pass it on as a philosophy.,And for me, it's quite romantic,,but it's about if one personnteaches three people,how to cook something,,and they teach three of their mates,,that only has to repeat itself 25 times,,and that's the wholenpopulation of America.,Romantic, yes, but most importantly,,it's about trying to get people to realize,that every one of your individual effortsnmakes a difference.,We've got to put back what's been lost.,Huntington's Kitchen.,Huntington, where I made this program,,we've got this prime-time program,that hopefully will inspire peoplento really get on this change.,I truly believe that change will happen.,Huntington's Kitchen.nI work with a community.,I worked in the schools.,I found local sustainable funding,to get every single school in the areanfrom the junk, onto the fresh food:,six-and-a-half grand per school. 
 (Applause) 
 That's all it takes,nsix-and-a-half grand per school.,The Kitchen is 25 grand a month. Okay?,This can do 5,000 people a year,,which is 10 percent of their population,,and it's people on people.,You know, it's local cooksnteaching local people.,It's free cooking lessons,nguys, in the Main Street.,This is real, tangible change,nreal, tangible change.,Around America, if we just look back now,,there is plenty of wonderfulnthings going on.,There is plenty of beautifulnthings going on.,There are angelsnaround America doing great things,in schools -- farm-to-school set-ups,,garden set-ups, education --,there are amazing peoplendoing this already.,The problem is they all want to roll out,what they're doing to the next school,,but there's no cash.,We need to recognize the expertsnand the angels quickly,,identify them, and allow themnto easily find the resource,to keep rolling outnwhat they're already doing,,and doing well.,Businesses of America need to support,Mrs. Obama to do the thingsnthat she wants to do. 
 (Applause) 
 And look, I know it's weird,having an English personnstanding here before you,talking about all this.,All I can say is: I care.,I'm a father,,and I love this country.,And I believe truly, actually,,that if change can be madenin this country,,beautiful things will happennaround the world.,If America does it,nother people will follow.,It's incredibly important. 
 (Audience) Yeah! 
 (Applause) 
 When I was in Huntington,,trying to get a few things to worknwhen they weren't,,I thought "If I had a magic wand,nwhat would I do?",And I thought, "You know what?,I'd just love to be put in frontnof some of the most amazing,movers and shakers in America.",And a month later, TED phoned me upnand gave me this award.,I'm here.,So, my wish.,Dyslexic, so I'm a bit slow.,My wish,is for you to help a strong,nsustainable movement,to educate every child,about food,,to inspire families to cook again,,and to empower people everywhere,to fight obesity. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause continues)I'm here to spread the word about the,magnificence of spiders,and how much we can learn from them.,Spiders are truly global citizens.,You can find spiders in nearly,every terrestrial habitat.,This red dot marks,the Great Basin of North America,,and I'm involved with an alpine biodiversity,project there with some collaborators.,Here's one of our field sites,,and just to give you a sense of perspective,,this little blue smudge here,,that's one of my collaborators.,This is a rugged and barren landscape,,yet there are quite a few spiders here.,Turning rocks over revealed this crab spider,grappling with a beetle. 
 Spiders are not just everywhere,,but they're extremely diverse.,There are over 40,000 described species,of spiders.,To put that number into perspective,,here's a graph comparing the 40,000,species of spiders,to the 400 species of primates.,There are two orders of magnitude more,spiders than primates.,Spiders are also extremely old.,On the bottom here,,this is the geologic timescale,,and the numbers on it indicate millions,of years from the present, so the zero here,,that would be today.,So what this figure shows is that spiders,date back to almost 380 million years.,To put that into perspective, this red,vertical bar here marks the divergence time,of humans from chimpanzees,,a mere seven million years ago. 
 All spiders make silk,at some point in their life.,Most spiders use copious amounts of silk,,and silk is essential to their survival,and reproduction.,Even fossil spiders can make silk,,as we can see from this impression of,a spinneret on this fossil spider.,So this means that both spiders,and spider silk have been around,for 380 million years.,It doesn't take long from working with spiders,to start noticing how essential silk is,to just about every aspect of their life.,Spiders use silk for many purposes, including,the trailing safety dragline,,wrapping eggs for reproduction,,protective retreats,and catching prey. 
 There are many kinds of spider silk.,For example, this garden spider can make,seven different kinds of silks.,When you look at this orb web, you're actually,seeing many types of silk fibers.,The frame and radii of this web,is made up of one type of silk,,while the capture spiral is a composite,of two different silks:,the filament and the sticky droplet.,How does an individual spider,make so many kinds of silk?,To answer that, you have to look a lot closer,at the spinneret region of a spider.,So silk comes out of the spinnerets, and for,those of us spider silk biologists, this is what,we call the "business end" of the spider. (Laughter),We spend long days ...,Hey! Don't laugh. That's my life.,(Laughter),We spend long days and nights,staring at this part of the spider.,And this is what we see.,You can see multiple fibers,coming out of the spinnerets, because,each spinneret has many spigots on it.,Each of these silk fibers exits from the spigot,,and if you were to trace the fiber back,into the spider, what you would find is that,each spigot connects to its own individual,silk gland. A silk gland kind of looks like a sac,with a lot of silk proteins stuck inside.,So if you ever have the opportunity to dissect,an orb-web-weaving spider,,and I hope you do,,what you would find is a bounty,of beautiful, translucent silk glands. 
 Inside each spider, there are hundreds,of silk glands, sometimes thousands.,These can be grouped into seven categories.,They differ by size, shape,,and sometimes even color.,In an orb-web-weaving spider,,you can find seven types of silk glands,,and what I have depicted here in this picture,,let's start at the one o'clock position,,there's tubuliform silk glands, which are used,to make the outer silk of an egg sac.,There's the aggregate and flagelliform silk,glands which combine to make the sticky,capture spiral of an orb web.,Pyriform silk glands make the attachment,cement -- that's the silk that's used to adhere,silk lines to a substrate.,There's also aciniform silk,,which is used to wrap prey.,Minor ampullate silk is used in web construction.,And the most studied silk line,of them all: major ampullate silk.,This is the silk that's used to make the frame,and radii of an orb web, and also,the safety trailing dragline. 
 But what, exactly, is spider silk?,Spider silk is almost entirely protein.,Nearly all of these proteins can be explained,by a single gene family,,so this means that the diversity of silk types,we see today is encoded by one gene family,,so presumably the original spider ancestor,made one kind of silk,,and over the last 380 million years,,that one silk gene has duplicated,and then diverged, specialized,,over and over and over again, to get,the large variety of flavors of spider silks,that we have today.,There are several features that all these silks,have in common. They all have a common,design, such as they're all very long --,they're sort of outlandishly long,compared to other proteins.,They're very repetitive, and they're very rich,in the amino acids glycine and alanine.,To give you an idea of what,a spider silk protein looks like,,this is a dragline silk protein,,it's just a portion of it,,from the black widow spider.,This is the kind of sequence that I love,looking at day and night. (Laughter) 
 So what you're seeing here is the one letter,abbreviation for amino acids, and I've colored,in the glycines with green,,and the alanines in red, and so,you can see it's just a lot of G's and A's.,You can also see that there's a lot of short,sequence motifs that repeat over and over,and over again, so for example there's a lot of,what we call polyalanines, or iterated A's,,AAAAA. There's GGQ. There's GGY.,You can think of these short motifs,that repeat over and over again as words,,and these words occur in sentences.,So for example this would be one sentence,,and you would get this sort of green region,and the red polyalanine, that repeats,over and over and over again,,and you can have that hundreds and,hundreds and hundreds of times within,an individual silk molecule. 
 Silks made by the same spider can have,dramatically different repeat sequences.,At the top of the screen, you're seeing,the repeat unit from the dragline silk,of a garden argiope spider.,It's short. And on the bottom,,this is the repeat sequence for the,egg case, or tubuliform silk protein,,for the exact same spider. And you can see,how dramatically different,these silk proteins are -- so this is,sort of the beauty of the diversification,of the spider silk gene family.,You can see that the repeat units differ,in length. They also differ in sequence.,So I've colored in the glycines again,in green, alanine in red, and the serines,,the letter S, in purple. And you can see,that the top repeat unit can be explained,almost entirely by green and red,,and the bottom repeat unit has,a substantial amount of purple.,What silk biologists do is we try to relate,these sequences, these amino acid,sequences, to the mechanical properties,of the silk fibers. 
 Now, it's really convenient that spiders use their silk,completely outside their body.,This makes testing spider silk really, really,easy to do in the laboratory, because,we're actually, you know, testing it in air,that's exactly the environment that,spiders are using their silk proteins.,So this makes quantifying silk properties by,methods such as tensile testing, which is,basically, you know, tugging on one end,of the fiber, very amenable.,Here are stress-strain curves,generated by tensile testing,five fibers made by the same spider.,So what you can see here is that,the five fibers have different behaviors.,Specifically, if you look on the vertical axis,,that's stress. If you look at the maximum,stress value for each of these fibers,,you can see that there's a lot of variation,,and in fact dragline, or major ampullate silk,,is the strongest of these fibers.,We think that's because the dragline silk,,which is used to make the frame and radii,for a web, needs to be very strong. 
 On the other hand, if you were to look at,strain -- this is how much a fiber can be,extended -- if you look at the maximum value,here, again, there's a lot of variation,and the clear winner is flagelliform,,or the capture spiral filament.,In fact, this flagelliform fiber can,actually stretch over twice its original length.,So silk fibers vary in their strength,and also their extensibility.,In the case of the capture spiral,,it needs to be so stretchy to absorb,the impact of flying prey.,If it wasn't able to stretch so much, then,basically when an insect hit the web,,it would just trampoline right off of it.,So if the web was made entirely out of,dragline silk, an insect is very likely to just,bounce right off. But by having really, really,stretchy capture spiral silk, the web is actually,able to absorb the impact,of that intercepted prey. 
 There's quite a bit of variation within,the fibers that an individual spider can make.,We call that the tool kit of a spider.,That's what the spider has,to interact with their environment.,But how about variation among spider,species, so looking at one type of silk,and looking at different species of spiders?,This is an area that's largely unexplored,but here's a little bit of data I can show you.,This is the comparison of the toughness,of the dragline spilk spun,by 21 species of spiders.,Some of them are orb-weaving spiders and,some of them are non-orb-weaving spiders.,It's been hypothesized that,orb-weaving spiders, like this argiope here,,should have the toughest dragline silks,because they must intercept flying prey.,What you see here on this toughness graph,is the higher the black dot is on the graph,,the higher the toughness. 
 The 21 species are indicated here by this,phylogeny, this evolutionary tree, that shows,their genetic relationships, and I've colored,in yellow the orb-web-weaving spiders.,If you look right here at the two red arrows,,they point to the toughness values,for the draglines of nephila clavipes and,araneus diadematus.,These are the two species of spiders,for which the vast majority of time and money,on synthetic spider silk research has been,to replicate their dragline silk proteins.,Yet, their draglines are not the toughest.,In fact, the toughest dragline in this survey,is this one right here in this white region,,a non orb-web-weaving spider.,This is the dragline spun by scytodes,,the spitting spider.,Scytodes doesn't use a web at all,to catch prey. Instead, scytodes,sort of lurks around and waits for prey,to get close to it, and then immobilizes prey,by spraying a silk-like venom onto that insect.,Think of hunting with silly string.,That's how scytodes forages.,We don't really know why scytodes,needs such a tough dragline,,but it's unexpected results like this that make,bio-prospecting so exciting and worthwhile.,It frees us from the constraints,of our imagination. 
 Now I'm going to mark on,the toughness values for nylon fiber,,bombyx -- or domesticated silkworm silk --,wool, Kevlar, and carbon fibers.,And what you can see is that nearly,all the spider draglines surpass them.,It's the combination of strength, extensibility,and toughness that makes spider silk so,special, and that has attracted the attention,of biomimeticists, so people that turn,to nature to try to find new solutions.,And the strength, extensibility and toughness,of spider silks combined with the fact that,silks do not elicit an immune response,,have attracted a lot of interest in the use,of spider silks in biomedical applications,,for example, as a component of,artificial tendons, for serving as,guides to regrow nerves, and for,scaffolds for tissue growth. 
 Spider silks also have a lot of potential,for their anti-ballistic capabilities.,Silks could be incorporated into body,and equipment armor that would be more,lightweight and flexible,than any armor available today.,In addition to these biomimetic,applications of spider silks,,personally, I find studying spider silks,just fascinating in and of itself.,I love when I'm in the laboratory,,a new spider silk sequence comes in.,That's just the best. (Laughter),It's like the spiders are sharing,an ancient secret with me, and that's why,I'm going to spend the rest of my life,studying spider silk.,The next time you see a spider web,,please, pause and look a little closer.,You'll be seeing one of the most,high-performance materials known to man.,To borrow from the writings,of a spider named Charlotte,,silk is terrific. 
 Thank you. (Applause) 
 (Applause)I am a cultural omnivore,,one whose daily commute is made possiblenby attachment to an iPod --,an iPod that contains Wagner and Mozart,,pop diva Christina Aguilera,,country singer Josh Turner,,gangsta rap artist Kirk Franklin,,concerti, symphonies and more and more.,I'm a voracious reader,,a reader who deals with Ian McEwanndown to Stephanie Meyer.,I have read the Twilight tetralogy.,And one who lives for my home theater,,a home theater where I devournDVDs, video on demand,and a lot of television.,For me, "Law & Order: SVU,"nTina Fey and "30 Rock",and "Judge Judy" --,"The people are real, the cases are real,nthe rulings are final." 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, I'm convinced a lot of younprobably share my passions,,especially my passion for "Judge Judy,",and you'd fight anybodynwho attempted to take her away from us,,but I'm a little less convinced that younshare the central passion of my life,,a passion for the livenprofessional performing arts,,performing arts that representnthe orchestral repertoire, yes,,but jazz as well, modern dance, opera,,theater and more and more and more. 
 Frankly, it's a sector that many of usnwho work in the field,worry is being endangerednand possibly dismantled by technology.,While we initially heralded the Internetnas the fantastic new marketing device,that was going to solve all our problems,,we now realize that the Internetnis, if anything,,too effective in that regard.,Depending on who you read,nan arts organization,or an artist, who triesnto attract the attention,of a potential single ticket buyer,,now competes with between three and 5,000ndifferent marketing messages,a typical citizen sees every single day.,We now know, in fact,,that technology is our biggestncompetitor for leisure time.,Five years ago,,Gen Xers spent 20.7 hours online and TV,nthe majority on TV.,Gen Yers spent even more --,23.8 hours, the majority online.,And now, a typical university-enteringnstudent arrives at college,already having spent 20,000 hours online,and an additional 10,000 hoursnplaying video games --,a stark reminder that we operatenin a cultural context,where video games now outsellnmusic and movie recordings combined. 
 Moreover, we're afraid that technology,has altered our very assumptionsnof cultural consumption.,Thanks to the Internet,,we believe we can get anythingnwe want whenever we want it,,delivered to our own doorstep.,We can shop at three in the morningnor eight at night,,ordering jeans tailor-madenfor our unique body types.,Expectations of personalizationnand customization,that the live performing arts --,which have set curtain times, set venues,,attendant inconveniencesnof travel, parking and the like --,simply cannot meet.,And we're all acutely aware:,what's it going to mean in the future,when we ask someonento pay a hundred dollars,for a symphony, opera or ballet ticket,,when that cultural consumernis used to downloading on the internet,24 hours a daynfor 99 cents a song or for free?,These are enormous questionsnfor those of us that work in this terrain.,But as particular as they feel to us,nwe know we're not alone. 
 All of us are engaged,in a seismic, fundamental realignmentnof culture and communications,,a realignment that is shakingnand decimating the newspaper industry,,the magazine industry,nthe book and publishing industry and more.,Saddled in the performing arts as we are,nby antiquated union agreements,that inhibit and often prohibitnmechanical reproduction and streaming,,locked into large facilitiesnthat were designed to ossify,the ideal relationshipnbetween artist and audience,most appropriate to the 19th century,and locked into a business modelndependent on high ticket revenues,,where we charge exorbitant prices.,Many of us shudder in the wakenof the collapse of Tower Records,and ask ourselves, "Are we next?",Everyone I talk to in performing artsnresonates to the words of Adrienne Rich,,who, in "Dreams of a CommonnLanguage," wrote,,"We are out in a countrynthat has no language, no laws.,Whatever we do together is pure invention.,The maps they gave usnare out of date by years.",And for those of you who love the arts,,aren't you glad you invitednme here to brighten your day? 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Now, rather than saying that we'renon the brink of our own annihilation,,I prefer to believe that we are engagednin a fundamental reformation,,a reformation like the religiousnReformation of the 16th century.,The arts reformation,nlike the religious Reformation,,is spurred in part by technology,,with indeed, the printing pressnreally leading the charge,on the religious Reformation.,Both reformations were predicatednon fractious discussion,,internal self-doubt,and massive realignmentnof antiquated business models.,And at heart, both reformations, I think,nwere asking the questions:,who's entitled to practice?,How are they entitled to practice?,And indeed, do we need anyonento intermediate for us,in order to have an experiencenwith a spiritual divine? 
 Chris Anderson,nsomeone I trust you all know,,editor in chief of Wired magazinenand author of The Long Tail,,really was the first, for me,nto nail a lot of this.,He wrote a long time ago, you know,,thanks to the invention of the Internet,nweb technology, minicams and more,,the means of artistic productionnhave been democratized,for the first timenin all of human history.,In the 1930s, if any of you wantednto make a movie,,you had to work fornWarner Brothers or RKO,,because who could afford a movie set,and lighting equipmentnand editing equipment,and scoring, and more?,And now who in this roomndoesn't know a 14 year-old,hard at work on her second,nthird, or fourth movie? 
 (Laughter) 
 Similarly, the meansnof artistic distribution,have been democratizednfor the first time in human history.,Again, in the '30s, Warner Brothers,nRKO did that for you.,Now, go to YouTube, Facebook;,you have worldwide distribution,without leaving the privacynof your own bedroom. 
 This double impact is occasioning,a massive redefinitionnof the cultural market,,a time when anyone is a potential author.,Frankly, what we're seeing nownin this environment,is a massive time,nwhen the entire world is changing,as we move from a timenwhen audience numbers are plummeting.,But the number of arts participants,,people who write poetry, who sing songs,nwho perform in church choirs,,is exploding beyondnour wildest imaginations.,This group, others havencalled the pro-ams,,amateur artists doing worknat a professional level.,You see them on YouTube,nin dance competitions,,film festivals and more.,They are radically expanding,our notions of the potentialnof an aesthetic vocabulary,,while they are challenging and undermining,the cultural autonomynof our traditional institutions.,Ultimately, we now live in a worldndefined not by consumption,,but by participation. 
 But I want to be clear,,just as the religious Reformationndid not spell the end,to the formal Church or to the priesthood;,I believe that our artistic institutionsnwill continue to have importance.,They currently are the best opportunities,for artists to have livesnof economic dignity --,not opulence, of dignity.,And they are the places where artists,who deserve and want to worknat a certain scale of resources,will find a home.,But to view them as synonymousnwith the entirety of the arts community,is, by far, too shortsighted.,And indeed, while we've tended to polarizenthe amateur from the professional,,the single most exciting developmentnin the last five to 10 years,has been the risenof the professional hybrid artist,,the professional artist who works,,not primarily in the concert hallnor on the stage;,but most frequently aroundnwomen's rights, or human rights,,or on global warming issuesnor AIDS relief for more --,not out of economic necessity,,but out of a deep, organic conviction,that the work that she or henis called to do,cannot be accomplished in the traditionalnhermetic arts environment. 
 Today's dance world is not defined solely,by the Royal Winnipeg Balletnor the National Ballet of Canada,,but by Liz Lerman's Dance Exchange --,a multi-generational,nprofessional dance company,,whose dancers range in age from 18 to 82,,and who work with genomic scientistsnto embody the DNA strand,and with nuclear physicists at CERN.,Today's professional theater community,is defined, not only the Shawnand Stratford Festivals,,but by the Cornerstone Theaternof Los Angeles --,a collective of artists that after 9/11,,brought together 10 differentnreligious communities --,the Baha'i, the Catholic,,the Muslim, the Jewish,,even the Native American,and the gay and lesbianncommunities of faith,,helping them createntheir own individual plays,and one massive play,,where they explorednthe differences in their faith,and found commonality,as an important first stepntoward cross-community healing.,Today's performers, like Rhodessa Jones,nwork in women's prisons,,helping women prisonersnarticulate the pain of incarceration,,while today's playwrightsnand directors work with youth gangs,to find alternate channels to violencenand more and more and more.,And indeed, I think,nrather than being annihilated,,the performing artsnare poised on the brink of a time,when we will be more importantnthan we have ever been. 
 You know, we've said for a long time,,we are critical to the healthnof the economic communities in your town.,And absolutely --,I hope you know that every dollar spentnon a performing arts ticket in a community,generates five to sevennadditional dollars for the local economy,,dollars spent in restaurantsnor on parking,,at the fabric storesnwhere we buy fabric for costumes,,the piano tuner who tunesnthe instruments, and more.,But the arts are going to be morenimportant to economies as we go forward,,especially in industriesnwe can't even imagine yet,,just as they have been central to the iPodnand the computer game industries,,which few, if any of us,ncould have foreseen 10 to 15 years ago.,Business leadership will dependnmore and more on emotional intelligence,,the ability to listen deeply,,to have empathy,,to articulate change,nto motivate others --,the very capacities that the artsncultivate with every encounter. 
 Especially now,,as we all must confrontnthe fallacy of a market-only orientation,,uninformed by social conscience;,we must seize and celebratenthe power of the arts,to shape our individualnand national characters,,and especially charactersnof the young people,,who all too often are subjectednto bombardment of sensation,,rather than digested experience.,Ultimately, especially now in this world,,where we live in a context of regressivenand onerous immigration laws,,in reality TV that thrives on humiliation,,and in a context of analysis,,where the thing we hear most repeatedly,nday in, day out in the United States,,in every train station, every bus station,nevery plane station is,,"Ladies and gentlemen,,please report any suspicious behaviornor suspicious individuals,to the authorities nearest to you,",when all of these ways we are encouraged,to view our fellow human beingnwith hostility and fear,and contempt and suspicion. 
 The arts, whatever they do,nwhenever they call us together,,invite us to look at our fellownhuman being with generosity and curiosity.,God knows, if we ever needednthat capacity in human history,,we need it now.,You know, we're bound together,,not, I think by technology,nentertainment and design,,but by common cause.,We work to promotenhealthy vibrant societies,,to ameliorate human suffering,,to promote a more thoughtful,nsubstantive, empathic world order. 
 I salute all of younas activists in that quest,and urge you to embracenand hold dear the arts in your work,,whatever your purpose may be.,I promise you the handnof the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation,is stretched out in friendshipnfor now and years to come.,And I thank you for your kindnessnand your patience,in listening to me this afternoon. 
 Thank you, and Godspeed.Can I ask you to please recall a time,when you really loved something --,a movie, an album, a song or a book --,and you recommended it wholeheartedly,to someone you also really liked,,and you anticipated that reaction, you waited for it,,and it came back, and the person hated it?,So, by way of introduction,,that is the exact same state,in which I spent every working day of the last six years. (Laughter),I teach high school math.,I sell a product to a market,that doesn't want it, but is forced by law to buy it.,I mean, it's just a losing proposition. 
 So there's a useful stereotype about students that I see,,a useful stereotype about you all.,I could give you guys,an algebra-two final exam,,and I would expect no higher,than a 25 percent pass rate.,And both of these facts say less about you or my students,than they do about what we call math education,in the U.S. today. 
 To start with, I'd like to break math down into two categories.,One is computation; this is the stuff you've forgotten.,For example, factoring quadratics with,leading coefficients greater than one.,This stuff is also really easy to relearn,,provided you have a really strong grounding,in reasoning. Math reasoning --,we'll call it the application,of math processes to the world around us --,this is hard to teach.,This is what we would love students to retain,,even if they don't go into mathematical fields.,This is also something that, the way we teach it in the U.S.,all but ensures they won't retain it.,So, I'd like to talk about why that is,,why that's such a calamity for society, what we can do about it,and, to close with, why this is an amazing time,to be a math teacher. 
 So first, five symptoms,that you're doing math reasoning wrong,in your classroom.,One is a lack of initiative; your students don't self-start.,You finish your lecture block,and immediately you have five hands going up,asking you to re-explain the entire thing at their desks.,Students lack perseverance.,They lack retention; you find yourself,re-explaining concepts three months later, wholesale.,There's an aversion to word problems,,which describes 99 percent of my students.,And then the other one percent,is eagerly looking for the formula,to apply in that situation.,This is really destructive. 
 David Milch, creator of "Deadwood" and other amazing TV shows,,has a really good description for this.,He swore off creating,contemporary drama,,shows set in the present day,,because he saw that when people fill their mind,with four hours a day of, for example, "Two and a Half Men," no disrespect,,it shapes the neural pathways, he said,,in such a way that they expect simple problems.,He called it, "an impatience with irresolution.",You're impatient with things that don't resolve quickly.,You expect sitcom-sized problems that wrap up in 22 minutes,,three commercial breaks and a laugh track.,And I'll put it to all of you,,what you already know, that no problem worth solving is that simple.,I am very concerned about this,because I'm going to retire in a world that my students will run.,I'm doing bad things,to my own future and well-being,when I teach this way.,I'm here to tell you that the way our textbooks -- particularly,mass-adopted textbooks -- teach math reasoning,and patient problem solving,,it's functionally equivalent to turning on "Two and a Half Men" and calling it a day. 
 (Laughter) 
 In all seriousness. Here's an example from a physics textbook.,It applies equally to math.,Notice, first of all here,,that you have exactly three pieces of information there,,each of which will figure into a formula,somewhere, eventually,,which the student will then compute.,I believe in real life.,And ask yourself, what problem have you solved, ever,,that was worth solving,where you knew all of the given information in advance;,where you didn't have a surplus of information and you had to filter it out,,or you didn't have sufficient information,and had to go find some.,I'm sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that.,And the textbook, I think, knows how it's hamstringing students,because, watch this, this is the practice problem set.,When it comes time to do the actual problem set,,we have problems like this right here,where we're just swapping out numbers and tweaking the context a little bit.,And if the student still doesn't recognize the stamp this was molded from,,it helpfully explains to you,what sample problem you can return to to find the formula.,You could literally, I mean this,,pass this particular unit without knowing any physics,,just knowing how to decode a textbook. That's a shame. 
 So I can diagnose the problem a little more specifically in math.,Here's a really cool problem. I like this.,It's about defining steepness and slope,using a ski lift.,But what you have here is actually four separate layers,,and I'm curious which of you can see the four separate layers,and, particularly, how when they're compressed together,and presented to the student all at once,,how that creates this impatient problem solving.,I'll define them here: You have the visual.,You also have the mathematical structure,,talking about grids, measurements, labels,,points, axes, that sort of thing.,You have substeps, which all lead to what we really want to talk about:,which section is the steepest. 
 So I hope you can see.,I really hope you can see how what we're doing here,is taking a compelling question, a compelling answer,,but we're paving a smooth, straight path,from one to the other,and congratulating our students for how well,they can step over the small cracks in the way.,That's all we're doing here.,So I want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way,and build them up with students,,we can have everything we're looking for in terms of patient problem solving. 
 So right here I start with the visual,,and I immediately ask the question:,Which section is the steepest?,And this starts conversation,because the visual is created in such a way where you can defend two answers.,So you get people arguing against each other,,friend versus friend,,in pairs, journaling, whatever.,And then eventually we realize,it's getting annoying to talk about,the skier in the lower left-hand side of the screen,or the skier just above the mid line.,And we realize how great would it be,if we just had some A, B, C and D labels,to talk about them more easily.,And then as we start to define what does steepness mean,,we realize it would be nice to have some measurements,to really narrow it down, specifically what that means.,And then and only then,,we throw down that mathematical structure.,The math serves the conversation,,the conversation doesn't serve the math.,And at that point, I'll put it to you that nine out of 10 classes,are good to go on the whole slope, steepness thing.,But if you need to,,your students can then develop those substeps together. 
 Do you guys see how this, right here, compared to that --,which one creates that patient problem solving, that math reasoning?,It's been obvious in my practice, to me.,And I'll yield the floor here for a second to Einstein,,who, I believe, has paid his dues.,He talked about the formulation of a problem being so incredibly important,,and yet in my practice, in the U.S. here,,we just give problems to students;,we don't involve them in the formulation of the problem. 
 So 90 percent of what I do,with my five hours of prep time per week,is to take fairly compelling elements,of problems like this from my textbook,and rebuild them in a way that supports math reasoning and patient problem solving.,And here's how it works.,I like this question. It's about a water tank.,The question is: How long will it take you to fill it up?,First things first, we eliminate all the substeps.,Students have to develop those,,they have to formulate those.,And then notice that all the information written on there is stuff you'll need.,None of it's a distractor, so we lose that.,Students need to decide, "All right, well,,does the height matter? Does the side of it matter?,Does the color of the valve matter? What matters here?",Such an underrepresented question in math curriculum.,So now we have a water tank.,How long will it take you to fill it up? And that's it. 
 And because this is the 21st century,and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms,,not in terms of line art or clip art,that you so often see in textbooks,,we go out and we take a picture of it.,So now we have the real deal.,How long will it take it to fill it up?,And then even better is we take a video,,a video of someone filling it up.,And it's filling up slowly, agonizingly slowly.,It's tedious.,Students are looking at their watches, rolling their eyes,,and they're all wondering at some point or another,,"Man, how long is it going to take to fill up?",(Laughter),That's how you know you've baited the hook, right? 
 And that question, off this right here, is really fun for me,because, like the intro,,I teach kids -- because of my inexperience --,I teach the kids that are the most remedial, all right?,And I've got kids who will not join a conversation about math,because someone else has the formula;,someone else knows how to work the formula better than me,,so I won't talk about it.,But here, every student is on a level playing field of intuition.,Everyone's filled something up with water before,,so I get kids answering the question, "How long will it take?",I've got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated,joining the conversation.,We put names on the board, attach them to guesses,,and kids have bought in here.,And then we follow the process I've described.,And the best part here, or one of the better parts,is that we don't get our answer from the answer key,in the back of the teacher's edition.,We, instead, just watch the end of the movie.,(Laughter),And that's terrifying,,because the theoretical models that always work out,in the answer key in the back of a teacher's edition,,that's great, but,it's scary to talk about sources of error,when the theoretical does not match up with the practical.,But those conversations have been so valuable,,among the most valuable. 
 So I'm here to report some really fun games,with students who come pre-installed,with these viruses day one of the class.,These are the kids who now, one semester in,,I can put something on the board,,totally new, totally foreign,,and they'll have a conversation about it for three or four minutes more,than they would have at the start of the year,,which is just so fun.,We're no longer averse to word problems,,because we've redefined what a word problem is.,We're no longer intimidated by math,,because we're slowly redefining what math is.,This has been a lot of fun. 
 I encourage math teachers I talk to to use multimedia,,because it brings the real world into your classroom,in high resolution and full color;,to encourage student intuition for that level playing field;,to ask the shortest question you possibly can,and let those more specific questions come out in conversation;,to let students build the problem,,because Einstein said so;,and to finally, in total, just be less helpful,,because the textbook is helping you in all the wrong ways:,It's buying you out of your obligation,,for patient problem solving and math reasoning, to be less helpful. 
 And why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now,is because we have the tools to create,this high-quality curriculum in our front pocket.,It's ubiquitous and fairly cheap,,and the tools to distribute it,freely under open licenses,has also never been cheaper or more ubiquitous.,I put a video series on my blog not so long ago,and it got 6,000 views in two weeks.,I get emails still from teachers in countries I've never visited,saying, "Wow, yeah. We had a good conversation about that.,Oh, and by the way, here's how I made your stuff better,",which, wow.,I put this problem on my blog recently:,In a grocery store, which line do you get into,,the one that has one cart and 19 items,or the line with four carts and three, five, two and one items.,And the linear modeling involved in that was some good stuff for my classroom,,but it eventually got me on "Good Morning America" a few weeks later,,which is just bizarre, right? 
 And from all of this, I can only conclude,that people, not just students,,are really hungry for this.,Math makes sense of the world.,Math is the vocabulary,for your own intuition.,So I just really encourage you, whatever your stake is in education --,whether you're a student, parent, teacher, policy maker, whatever --,insist on better math curriculum.,We need more patient problem solvers. Thank you. (Applause)I would be willing to betnI'm the dumbest guy in the room,,because I couldn't get through school;nI struggled with school.,But I knew at a very early agenthat I loved money, I loved business,and I loved this entrepreneurial thing.,I was raised to be an entrepreneur.,What I've been reallynpassionate about ever since --,and I've never spokennabout this ever, until now --,so this is the first timenanyone's heard it,,except my wife, three days ago.,She said, "What are you talking about?",I told her that I thinknwe miss an opportunity,to find these kidsnwho have the entrepreneurial traits,,and to groom them or show them,that being an entrepreneurnis actually a cool thing.,It's not somethingnthat is a bad thing and is vilified,,which is what happens in a lot of society. 
 Kids, when we grow up, have dreams,,and we have passions, and we have visions,,and somehow we get those things crushed.,We get told that we need to study harder,or be more focused or get a tutor.,My parents got me a tutor in French,nand I still suck in French.,Two years ago,,I was the highest-rated lecturernat MIT's Entrepreneurial Master's Program.,It was a speaking eventnin front of groups of entrepreneurs,from around the world.,When I was in grade two,nI won a citywide speaking competition,,but nobody had ever said,n"Hey, this kid's a good speaker.,He can't focus, but he loves walkingnaround and getting people energized.",No one said, "Get himna coach in speaking.",They said, get me a tutornin what I suck at. 
 So as kids show these traits --nand we need to start looking for them --,I think we should be raising kidsnto be entrepreneurs instead of lawyers.,Unfortunately, the school systemnis grooming this world to say,,"Let's be a lawyer,"nor, "Let's be a doctor.",We're missing that opportunity,,because no one ever says,n"Hey, be an entrepreneur.",Entrepreneurs are people --nwe have a lot of them in this room --,who have ideas and passionsnor see these needs in the world,and decide to stand up and do it.,And we put everything on the linento make that stuff happen.,We have the abilitynto get the groups of people around us,that want to build that dream with us.,And I think if we could get kidsnto embrace the idea at a young age,,of being entrepreneurial,,we could change everythingnin the world that's a problem today.,Every problem out there,nsomebody has the idea for.,And as a young kid,nnobody can say it can't happen,,because you're too dumb to realizenthat you couldn't figure it out. 
 I think we have an obligationnas parents and a society,to start teaching our kids to fishninstead of giving them the fish --,the old parable: "Give a manna fish, you feed him for a day.,Teach a man to fish,nyou feed him for a lifetime.",If we can teach our kidsnto be entrepreneurial,,the ones that show the traits to be,,like we teach the ones who havenscience gifts to go on in science,,what if we saw the onesnwith entrepreneurial traits,and taught them to be entrepreneurs?,We could have these kidsnspreading businesses,instead of waitingnfor government handouts. 
 What we do is teach our kidsnthe things they shouldn't do:,don't hit; don't bite; don't swear.,Right now we teach our kidsnto go after really good jobs;,the school system teaches themnto go after things like,being a doctor and being a lawyernand being an accountant and a dentist,and a teacher and a pilot.,And the media says it's really coolnif we could go out,and be a model or a singer,or a sports hero like Luongo or Crosby.,Our MBA programs do not teach kidsnto be entrepreneurs.,The reason I avoided an MBA program,nother than that I didn't get into any,,since I had a 61 percentnaverage out of high school,,then a 61 percent average,at the only school in Canadanthat accepted me, Carlton,,is that our MBA programs don't teachnkids to be entrepreneurs.,They teach them to work in corporations. 
 So who's starting these companies?nIt's these random few people.,Even in popular literature,nthe only book I've ever found --,and this should benon all your reading lists --,the only book I've ever found,that makes the entrepreneurna hero is "Atlas Shrugged.",Everything else in the worldnlooks at entrepreneurs,and says we're bad people.,I look at even my family.,Both my grandfathers and my dadnwere entrepreneurs.,My brother, sister and I,nall three of us own companies as well.,We all decided to start these thingsnbecause it's the only place we fit.,We didn't fit in normal work;nwe couldn't work for somebody else,,we're stubborn and we havenall these other traits. 
 But kids could be entrepreneurs as well.,I'm a big part of a couple organizations,called the Entrepreneurs' Organizationnand the Young Presidents' Organization.,I just came back from speakingnin Barcelona at the YPO global conference.,And everyone I met over therenwho's an entrepreneur,struggled with school.,I have 18 out of the 19 signsnof attention deficit disorder diagnosed.,So this thing right herenis freaking me out. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's probably why I'm a bit panicked,,other than all the caffeinenI've had and the sugar.,But this is really creepynfor an entrepreneur.,Attention deficit disorder,nbipolar disorder.,Do you know that bipolar disordernis nicknamed the CEO disease?,Ted Turner's got it. Steve Jobs has it.,All three of the foundersnof Netscape had it.,I could go on and on.,Kids -- you can see these signs in kids.,And we're giving them Ritalin and saying,,"Don't be an entrepreneurial type.,Fit into this other systemnand try to become a student.",Sorry, entrepreneurs aren't students.,We fast-track. We figure out the game.,I stole essays. I cheated on exams.,I hired kids to do my accountingnassignments in university,for 13 consecutive assignments.,But as an entrepreneur, you don't donaccounting, you hire accountants.,So I just figured that out earlier. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 At least I can admit I cheatednin university; most of you won't.,I'm also quoted -- and I toldnthe person who wrote the textbook --,I'm now quoted in that exact samenuniversity textbook,in every Canadian universitynand college studies --,in managerial accounting,nI'm chapter eight.,I open up chapter eight,ntalking about budgeting.,I told the author,nafter they did my interview,,that I cheated in that same course.,She thought it was too funnynto not include it. 
 But kids, you can see these signs in them.,The definition of entrepreneurnis "a person who organizes, operates,and assumes the risknof a business venture.",That doesn't mean you havento go to an MBA program,,or that you have to get through school.,It just means that those few thingsnhave to feel right in your gut.,We've heard, "Is it nurturenor is it nature?" Right?,Is it thing one or thing two? What is it?,Well, I don't think it's either.nI think it can be both.,I was groomed as an entrepreneur. 
 When I was growing upnas a young kid, I had no choice,,because I was taught at a very early age,,when my dad realized I didn't fitninto everything else,that was being taught to me in school,,that he could teach mento figure out business at an early age.,He groomed us, the three of us,nto hate the thought of having a job,and to love the fact of creating companies,where we could employ other people. 
 My first business venture:nI was seven years old, in Winnipeg.,I was in my bedroomnwith one of those long extension cords,,calling all the dry cleaners in Winnipeg,to find out how much they'd paynme for coat hangers.,And my mom came into the room and said,,"Where are you going to get the hangersnto sell to the dry cleaners?",And I said, "Let's go looknin the basement.",We went down to the basement,nand I opened up this cupboard.,There was about 1,000 hangersnthat I'd collected,,because, when I told hernI was going out to play,,I was going door to doornin the neighborhood,to collect hangers to put in the basement,,because I saw herna few weeks before that --,you could get paid, they used to payntwo cents per coat hanger.,So I was like, well,nthere's all kinds of hangers,,so I'll just go get them.,I knew she wouldn't want me to get them,,so I just did it anyway.,And I learned that you couldnactually negotiate with people.,This one guy offered me three centsnand I got him up to three and a half.,I even knew at seven years old,that I could getna fractional percent of a cent,,and people would pay it,nbecause it multiplied up.,At seven years old I figured it out.,I got three and a half centsnfor 1,000 hangers. 
 I sold license platenprotectors door to door.,My dad actually made me go find someone,who would sell me them at wholesale.,At nine years old, I walkednaround in the city of Sudbury,selling license-platenprotectors door to door.,And I remembernthis one customer so vividly --,I also did some other stuffnwith these clients, I sold newspapers,,and he wouldn't buyna newspaper from me, ever.,But I was convinced I was going to get himnto buy a license-plate protector.,And he's like, "We don't need one.",I said, "But you've got two cars.",Remember, I'm nine years old.,I'm like, "You have two cars and theyndon't have license-plate protectors.,And this car has one license platenthat's all crumpled up.",He said, "That's my wife's car.",I said, "Why don't we test one on her carnand see if it lasts longer?",So I knew there were two carsnwith two license plates on each.,If I couldn't sell all four,nI could at least get one.,I learned that at a young age. 
 I did comic book arbitrage.,When I was about 10 years old,nI sold comic books,out of our cottage on Georgian Bay.,I would go bikingnup to the end of the beach,,buy all the comics from the poor kids,,then go back to the other end of the beachnto sell them to the rich kids.,It was obvious to me: buy low, sell high.,You've got this demandnover here that has money.,Don't try to sell to the poor kids;nthey don't have cash.,The rich people do. Obvious, right?,It's like a recession.,So there's a recession.,There's still 13 trillion dollarsncirculating in the US economy.,Go get some of that.nI learned that at a young age.,I also learned, don't reveal your source:,I got beat up after four weeks of this,,because one of the rich kids found outnwhere I was buying my comics,,and didn't like that he was paying more. 
 I was forced to getna paper route at 10 years old.,I didn't want a paper route, but my dadnsaid, "That's your next business.",Not only did he get me one,nbut I had to get two.,He wanted me to hire someonento deliver half the papers,,which I did.,Then I realized: collecting tipsnis how you made all the money.,So I'd collect tips and get payment.,I would collect for the papers --nhe could just deliver them.,Because then I realizednI could make money.,By this point, I was definitelynnot going to be an employee. 
 (Laughter) 
 My dad owned an automotivenand industrial repair shop.,He had all these oldnautomotive parts lying around.,They had this old brass and copper.,I asked what he did with it,nand he said he just throws it out.,I said, "Wouldn't somebody paynfor that?" And he goes, "Maybe.",Remember: at 10 years old, 34 years ago,,I saw opportunity in this stuff,nI saw there was money in garbage.,And I collected it from the automotivenshops in the area on my bicycle.,Then my dad would drive me on Saturdaysnto a scrap metal recycler,where I got paid.,And I thought that was kind of cool.,Strangely enough, 30 years later,nwe're building 1-800-GOT-JUNK?,and making money off that, too. 
 I built these little pincushionsnwhen I was 11 years old in Cubs.,We made these pincushionsnfor our moms for Mother's Day,out of wooden clothespins --,when we used to hang clothesnon clotheslines outside.,And you'd make these chairs.,And I had these little pillowsnthat I would sew up.,And you could stuff pins in them.,Because people used to sewnand they needed a pincushion.,But I realized you had to have options,,so I spray-paintedna whole bunch of them brown,,so when I went to the door,nit wasn't, "Do you want to buy one?",It was, "Which color would you like?",I'm 10 years old;nyou're not going to say no,,especially if you have two options,nthe brown one or the clear one.,So I learned that lesson at a young age. 
 I learned that manual labor really sucks.,Right, like cutting lawns is brutal.,But because I had to cut lawnsnall summer for all of our neighbors,and get paid to do that,,I realized that recurring revenuenfrom one client is amazing,,that if I land this client once,,and every week I get paid by that person,,that's way better than trying to sellnone clothespin thing to one person,,because you can't sell them more.,So I love that recurring revenue modelnI started to learn at a young age. 
 Remember, I was being groomed to do this.nI was not allowed to have jobs.,I would go to the golf coursenand caddy for people,,but I realized there was this one hillnon our golf course, the 13th hole,,that had this huge hill,,and people could nevernget their bags up it.,So I'd sit there in a lawn chairnand carry for all the people,who didn't have caddies.,I'd carry their golf bags to the top;nthey'd pay me a dollar,,while my friends worked for hoursnhauling some guy's bag around,for 10 bucks.,I'm like, "That's stupid.nYou have to work for five hours.,That doesn't make sense. Figure outna way to make more money faster. 
 Every week, I'd go to the corner storenand buy all these pops,,Then I'd deliver themnto these 70-year-old women playing bridge.,They'd give me their ordersnfor the following week.,I'd deliver pop and charge twice.,I had this captured market.,You didn't need contracts, you just needednto have a supply and demand,and this audience who bought into you.,These women weren't goingnto go to anybody else,because they liked me,nand I kind of figured it out. 
 I went and got golf ballsnfrom golf courses.,But everybody else was looking in the bush,and looking in the ditches for golf balls.,I'm like, screw that. They're in the pond.nAnd nobody's going into the pond.,So I'd go into the ponds and crawlnaround and pick them up with my toes,,just pick them up with both feet.,You can't do it onstage.,You get the golf balls,nthrow them in your bathing suit trunks,and when you're done, you've gotna couple hundred of them.,But the problem is, peoplendidn't want all the golf balls.,So I just packaged them.nI'm like 12, right?,I packaged them up three ways.,I had the Pinnacles, DDHsnand the really cool ones.,Those sold for two dollars each.,Then I had the good onesnthat didn't look crappy: 50 cents each.,And then I'd sell 50 at a timenof all the crappy ones.,And they could use thosenfor practice balls. 
 I sold sunglasses when I was in school,,to all the kids in high school.,This is what really kind of getsneverybody hating you,,because you're trying to extract moneynfrom all your friends all the time.,But it paid the bills.,So I sold lots and lots of sunglasses.,Then when the school shut me down --,they called me into the officenand told me I couldn't do it --,I went to the gas stations and soldnlots of them to the gas stations,and had the gas stationsnsell them to their customers.,That was cool because then,nI had retail outlets.,I think I was 14. 
 Then I paid my entire way throughnfirst year of university at Carlton,by selling wineskins door to door.,You know you can holdna 40-ounce bottle of rum,and two bottles of coke in a wineskin?,So what, right? But you know what?,Stuff that down your shortsnwhen you go to a football game,,you can get booze in for free.,Everybody bought them.,Supply, demand, big opportunity.,I also branded it, so I sold themnfor five times the normal cost.,It had our university logo on it. 
 You know, we teach our kidsnand we buy them games,,but why don't we get them games,nif they're entrepreneurial kids,,that nurture the traitsnyou need to be entrepreneurs?,Why don't you teach themnnot to waste money?,I remember being told to walknout into the middle of a street,in Banff, Alberta.,I'd thrown a penny out in the street,,and my dad said, "Go pick it up.,I work too damn hard for my money.nI'm not going to see you waste a penny.",I remember that lesson to this day. 
 Allowances teach kids the wrong habits.,Allowances, by nature,nare teaching kids to think about a job.,An entrepreneur doesn't expectna regular paycheck.,Allowance is breeding kids at a young agento expect a regular paycheck.,That's wrong, for me,nif you want to raise entrepreneurs.,What I do with my kids, nine and seven,,is teach them to walknaround the house and the yard,,looking for stuff that needs to get done.,Come and tell me what it is.,Or I'll say, "Here's what I need done.",And then, you knownwhat we do? We negotiate.,They go around looking for what it is,,then we negotiate what they'll get paid.,They don't have a regular check,,but they have opportunitiesnto find more stuff,,and learn the skill of negotiatingnand of finding opportunities. 
 You breed that kind of stuff.,Each of my kids has two piggy banks.,Fifty percent of all the money they earnngoes in their house account,,50 percent goes in their toy account.,The toy account,nthey spend on whatever they want.,The 50 percent in their house account,nevery six months, goes to the bank.,they walk up with me.,Every year, all the moneynin the bank goes to their broker.,Both my nine- and seven-year-oldsnhave a stockbroker already.,I'm teaching themnto force that savings habit.,It drives me crazynthat 30-year-olds are saying,,"Maybe I'll start contributingnto my RSP now.",Shit, you've missed 25 years.,You can teach those habits to young kids,,when they don't even feel the pain yet. 
 Don't read bedtime stories every night --nmaybe four nights of the week,,and three nights, have them tell stories.,Why don't you sit down with kidsnand give them four items,,a red shirt, a blue tie,na kangaroo and a laptop,,and have them tell a storynabout those four things?,My kids do that all the time.,It teaches them to sell,nteaches them creativity,,teaches them to think on their feet.,Do that kind of stuff, have fun with it. 
 Get kids to stand upnin front of groups and talk,,even if it's justnin front of their friends,,and do plays and have speeches.,Those are entrepreneurial traitsnyou want to be nurturing.,Show kids what bad customersnor bad employees look like.,Show them grumpy employees.,When you see grumpyncustomer service, point it out.,Say, "By the way,nthat guy is a crappy employee.",And say, "These are good ones." 
 (Laughter) 
 If you go into a restaurantnand have bad customer service,,show them what badncustomer service looks like. 
 (Laughter) 
 We have all these lessons in front of us,,but we don't take those opportunities;nwe teach kids to get a tutor.,Imagine if you actually tooknall the kids' junk in the house right now,,all the toys they outgrew two years ago,and said, "Why don't we sellnsome of this on Craigslist and Kijiji?",And they actually sell it and learnnhow to find scammers when offers come in.,They can come into your accountnor a sub account or whatever.,But teach them how to fixnthe price, guess the price,,pull up the photos.,Teach them how to donthat kind of stuff and make money.,Then 50 percentngoes in their house account,,50 percent in their toy account.,My kids love this stuff. 
 Some of the entrepreneurial traitsnyou've got to nurture in kids:,attainment, tenacity, leadership,nintrospection, interdependence, values.,All these traits, you can find in youngnkids, and you can help nurture them.,Look for that kind of stuff.,There's two traits I want younto also look out for,that we don't get out of their system.,Don't medicate kidsnfor attention deficit disorder,unless it is really, really freaking bad. 
 (Applause) 
 The same with the whole thingsnon mania and stress and depression,,unless it is so clinically brutal, man.,Bipolar disorder is nicknamedn"the CEO disease.",When Steve Jurvetson, Jim Clarknand Jim Barksdale have all got it,,and they built Netscape --,imagine if they were given Ritalin.,We wouldn't have that stuff, right?,Al Gore really would have hadnto invented the Internet. 
 (Laughter) 
 These are the skillsnwe should be teaching in the classroom,,as well as everything else.,I'm not saying don't get kidsnto want to be lawyers.,But how about getting entrepreneurshipnto be ranked right up there,with the rest of them?,Because there's hugenopportunities in that. 
 I want to close with a quick video,that was done by onenof the companies I mentor.,These guys, Grasshopper.,It's about kids.,It's about entrepreneurship.,Hopefully, this inspires younto take what you've heard from me,and do something with itnto change the world. 
 [Kid... "And you thoughtnyou could do anything?"] 
 [You still can.] 
 [Because a lot of whatnwe consider impossible],[is easy to overcome] 
 [Because in case you haven'tnnoticed, we live in a place where],[one individual can make a difference] 
 [Want proof?],[Just look at the peoplenwho built our country:],[Our parents, grandparents,nour aunts, uncles],[They were immigrants, newcomersnready to make their mark],[Maybe they came with very little],[or perhaps they didn't ownnanything except for],[a single brilliant idea],[These people were thinkers, doers],[innovators],[until they came up with the name],[entrepreneurs] 
 [They change the way we thinknabout what is possible.],[They have a clear visionnof how life can be better],[for all of us, even whenntimes are tough.] 
 [Right now, it's hard to see],[when our view is clutterednwith obstacles.],[But turbulence creates opportunities],[for success, achievement, and pushes us],[to discover new ways of doing things] 
 [So what opportunitiesnwill you go after and why?],[If you're an entrepreneur],[you know that risk isn't the reward.],[No. The rewards are driving innovation],[changing people's lives. Creating jobs.],[Fueling growth.],[And making a better world.] 
 [Entrepreneurs are everywhere.],[They run small businessesnthat support our economy,],[design tools to help you],[stay connected with friends,nfamily and colleagues],[And they're finding new ways of helpingnto solve society's oldest problems.] 
 [Do you know an entrepreneur?],[Entrepreneurs can be anyonenEven... you],[So seize the opportunity to createnthe job you always wanted],[Help heal the economy],[Make a difference.],[Take your business to new heights,],[but most importantly,],[remember when you were a kid],[when everything was within your reach,],[and then say to yourselfnquietly, but with determination:] 
 [it still is.] 
 Thank you very much for having me. 
 (Applause)Basking sharks are awesome creatures.,They are just magnificent.,They grow 10 meters long; some say bigger.,They might weigh up to two tons.,Some say up to five tons.,They're the second-largestnfish in the world.,They're also harmlessnplankton-feeding animals.,And they are thought to be able to filterna cubic kilometer of water every hour,and can feed on 30 kilosnof zoo plankton a day to survive.,They're fantastic creatures.,We're very lucky in Ireland,,we have plenty of basking sharksnand plenty of opportunities to study them. 
 They were very importantnto coastal communities,,going back hundreds of years,,especially aroundnthe Claddaghduff, Connemara region,where subsistence farmers used to sailnout on their hookers and open boats,,sometimes way offshorento a place called the Sunfish Bank,,about 30 miles west of Achill Island,,to kill the basking sharks.,This is a woodcut from about the 1800s. 
 They were very important,nfor the oil out of their liver.,A third of the baskingnshark's size is their liver,,and it's full of oil, gallons of oil.,That oil was used especially for lighting,,but also for dressing woundsnand other things.,In fact, the streetlights in 1742,,of Galway, Dublin and Waterford,,were lit with sunfish oil.,"Sunfish" is one of the wordsnfor basking sharks.,So they were incredibly important animals.,They've been around a long time,nvery important to coastal communities. 
 Probably the best-documentednbasking shark fishery in the world,is that from Achill Island.,This is Keem Bay up in Achill Island.,Sharks used to come into the bay,,and the fishermennwould tie a net off the headland,,string it out, an old Manila net,,and as the shark came round,nit would hit the net,,the net would collapse on it.,It would often drown and suffocate.,Or at times, they would row outnin their small curraghs,and kill it with a lancenthrough the back of the neck.,And then they'd tow the sharksnback to Purteen Harbour,,boil them up, use the oil.,They also used the fleshnas well, for fertilizer,and also would fin the sharks.,This is probably the biggest threatnto sharks worldwide --,the finning of sharks. 
 We're often frightenednof sharks, thanks to "Jaws.",Maybe five or six peoplenget killed by sharks every year.,There was someone recently, wasn't there?nJust a couple weeks ago.,We kill about 100 million sharks a year.,So I don't know what the balance is,,but I think sharks have more rightnto be fearful of us than we have of them.,It was a well-documented fishery.,As you can see here,nit peaked in the '50s,,where they were killingn1,500 sharks a year.,And it declined very fast --na classic boom-and-bust fishery,,which suggests that a stocknhas been depleted,or there's low reproductive rates.,They killed about 12,000 sharksnwithin this period,,literally just by stringing a Manila rope,off the tip of Keem Baynup in Achill Island. 
 Sharks were still killednup into the mid-80s,,especially out of placesnlike Dunmore East in County Waterford.,About two and a half, 3,000nsharks were killed up till '85,,mainly by Norwegian vessels.,You can't really see,,but these are Norwegiannbasking shark hunting vessels.,The black line in the crow's nestnsignifies this is a shark vessel,,rather than a whaling vessel. 
 The importance of basking sharksnto the coast communities,is recognized through the language.,I don't pretendnto [know many Irish words],,but in Kerry they were oftennknown as "ainmhide Na seolta,","the monster with the sails.",Another title would be "liop an dá lapa,","the unwieldy beast with two fins.","Liabhán mór," suggesting a big animal.,Or my favorite, "liabhán chor gréine,"n"the great fish of the sun.",That's a lovely, evocative name.,On Tory Island -- a strange placenanyway -- they were known as "muldoons." 
 (Laughter) 
 No one seems to know why.,Hope there's no onenfrom Tory here. Lovely place.,But more commonly all around the island,nthey were known as the sunfish.,And this represents their habitnof basking on the surface,when the sun is out. 
 There's great concernnthat basking sharks are depleted,all throughout the world.,Some say it's not population decline,,it might be a changenin the distribution of plankton.,It's been suggested,that these sharks would makenfantastic indicators of climate change,,as they're basicallyncontinuous plankton recorders,,swimming around with their mouth open.,They're now listednas vulnerable under the IUCN.,There's movements in Europento try and stop catching them.,There's now a ban on catchingnand even landing them,,even landing ones caught accidentally.,They're not protected in Ireland;,in fact, they have no legislativenstatus in Ireland whatsoever,,despite our importance for the species,and also the historical contextnwithin which basking sharks reside. 
 We know very little about them.,And most of what we do know,is based on their habitnof coming to the surface --,we try and guess what they're doingnfrom their behavior on the surface.,I only found out last year,nat a conference on the Isle of Man,,just how unusual it is to live somewhere,where basking sharks regularly,nfrequently and predictably,come to the surface to "bask.",It's a fantastic opportunitynfor a scientist,to see and experience basking sharks.,They are awesome creatures.,It gives us a fantastic opportunitynto study them, to get access to them. 
 What we've been doing for a couplenyears -- last year was a big year --,is we started tagging sharks,,so we could try to get some ideanof sight fidelity and movement,and things like that.,So we concentrated mainlynin North Donegal and West Kerry,as the two areasnwhere I was mainly active.,And we tagged themnvery simply, not very high-tech,,with a big, long pole.,This is a beachcaster rodnwith a tag on the end.,You go up in your boat and tag the shark.,And we were very effective.,We tagged 105 sharks last summer.,We got 50 in three daysnoff Inishowen Peninsula. 
 Half the challenge to get access,is to be in the right placenat the right time.,But it's a very simple, easy technique;nI'll show you what it looks like.,We use a pole camera on the boatnto actually film the shark.,One, it's to try and work outnthe gender of the shark.,We also deployed some satellite tags,nso we did use high-tech stuff as well.,These are archival tags.,What they do is store the data.,A satellite tag only worksnwhen the air is clear of the water,and can send a signal to the satellite.,And sharks and fishnare underwater most of the time,,so this tag actually works outnthe locations of shark,,depending on the timingnand the setting of the sun,,plus water temperature and depth.,And you have to kind ofnreconstruct the path. 
 What happens is,,you set the tag to detachnfrom the shark after a fixed period --,in this case, eight months --,and literally to the day,nthe tag popped off,,drifted up, said hello to the satellite,and sent, not all the data,nbut enough data for us to use.,This is the only way to really work outntheir behavior and movements,when they're underwater. 
 And here's a couplenof maps that we've done.,In that one, you can seenthat we tagged both off Kerry.,Basically, it spent all its time,nthe last eight months, in Irish waters.,On Christmas, it was outnon the shelf edge.,Here's one we haven't ground-truthed yet,with sea-surface temperaturenand water depth,,but again, the second sharknspent most of its time,in and around the Irish Sea.,Colleagues from the Isle of Mannlast year actually tagged one shark,that went from the Isle of Mannto Nova Scotia in about 90 days.,Nine and a half thousand kilometers --nwe never thought that happened. 
 Another colleague in the Statesntagged about 20 sharks off Massachusetts.,His tags didn't really work.,All he knows is where he tagged them,,and where they popped off.,His tags popped off in the Caribbean,,and even in Brazil.,We thought basking sharksnwere temperate animals,and lived in our latitudes,,but in actual fact, they're obviouslyncrossing the equator as well. 
 So very simple things like that,,we're trying to learnnabout basking sharks.,One thing that I thinknis a very surprising and strange thing,is just how low the geneticndiversity of sharks is.,I'm not a geneticist, so I won't pretendnto understand the genetics.,And that's why it's greatnto have collaboration.,Whereas I'm a field person,,I get panic attacks,if I have to spend too many hoursnin a lab with a white coat on.,Take me away.,So we can work with geneticistsnwho understand that.,So when they looked atnthe genetics of basking sharks,,they found that the diversitynwas incredibly low. 
 If you look at the first line, really,,you can see that all these differentnshark species are all quite similar.,I think this means they're all sharks,and they've come from a common ancestry.,But if you look at nucleotide diversity,,which is more geneticsnthat are passed on through the parents,,you see that basking sharks,nif you look at the first study,,was order of magnitude less diverseneven than other shark species.,You can see this worknwas only done in 2006. 
 Before 2006, we had no idea of the geneticnvariability of basking sharks.,We had no idea: Did they distinguishninto different populations?,Were there subpopulations?,And that's very importantnif you want to know,what the population size is,nand the status of the animals.,So, Les Noble in Aberdeen kind of foundnthis a bit unbelievable, really.,So he did another studynusing microsatellites,,which is much more expensive,nmuch more time-consuming,,and to his surprise,ncame up with almost identical results. 
 So it does seem to benthat basking sharks, for some reason,,have incredibly low diversity.,And it's thought maybenit was a genetic bottleneck,,thought to have been 12,000 years ago,,and this has caused a very low diversity.,And yet, if you look at the whale shark,,which is the othernplankton-eating large shark,,its diversity is much greater. 
 So it doesn't really make sense at all.,They found that there wasnno genetic differentiation,between any of the world's oceansnof basking sharks:,even though they're foundnthroughout the world,,you couldn't tellnthe difference, genetically,,from one from the Pacific, Atlantic,nNew Zealand, Ireland, South Africa.,They all basically seem the same.,Which, again, is kind of surprising;nyou wouldn't expect that.,I don't understand or pretendnto understand this;,I suspect most geneticists don't either,,but they produce the numbers. 
 So you can actually estimatenthe population size,based on the diversity of the genetics.,And Rus Hoelzel came up withnan effective population size:,8,200 animals.,That's it -- 8,000 animals in the world.,You're thinking,n"That's ridiculous. No way.",So Les did a finer study,,and he found out it came out about 9,000.,Using different microsatellitesngave the different results,,but the mean of all thesenstudies is about 5,000,,which I personally don't believe.,But then, I am a skeptic.,But even if you toss a few numbers around,,you're probably talking an effectivenpopulation of about 20,000 animals.,Do you remember how many they killednoff Achill in the 70s and the 50s?,So what it tells us, actually,,is that there's actually a risknof extinction of this species,because its population is so small.,In fact, of those 20,000,,8,000 were thought to be females.,There's only 8,000 basking sharknfemales in the world?,I don't know. I don't believe it. 
 The problem with thisnis they were constrained with samples.,They didn't get enough samples,to really explore the geneticsnin enough detail.,So, where do you get samples fromnfor your genetic analysis?,Well, one obvious source is dead sharks --,dead sharks, washed up.,We might get two or three dead sharksnwashed up in Ireland a year,,if we're kind of lucky.,Another source would benfisheries' bycatch.,We were getting quite a few caughtnin surface drift nets.,That's banned now, and that'll bengood news for the sharks.,And some are caught in nets, in trawls.,This is a shark that was actuallynlanded in Howth just before Christmas --,illegally, because you're not allowednto do that under EU law --,and was actually soldnfor eight euros a kilo as shark steak.,They even put a recipe up on the wall,,until they were told it was illegal.,They actually did get a fine for that. 
 So if you look atnall those studies I showed you,,the total number of samples worldwide,is 86, at present.,So it's very important work,,and they can asknsome really good questions,,and tell us about population sizenand subpopulations and structure,,but they're constrainednby lack of samples. 
 When we were out tagging our sharks --,this is how we tagged them on the frontnof a RIB, get in there fast --,occasionally, the sharks do react.,On one occasion, when we werenup in Malin Head in Donegal,,the shark smacked the sidenof the boat with his tail,,more, I think, in startle to the factnthat a boat came near it,,rather than the tag going in.,And that was fine. We got wet. No problem.,And then when myself and Emmettngot back to Malin Head, to the pier,,I noticed some black slimenon the front of the boat.,I used to spend a lot of timenon commercial fishing boats,,and I remember fishermen saying,they can tell when a basking sharknhas been caught in a net,,because it leaves a black slime behind.,So that must have come from the shark. 
 Now, we had an interestnin getting tissue samples for genetics,because we knew they were very valuable.,We would use conventional methods;,I have a crossbow --nyou see it in my hand there,,which we use to sample whalesnand dolphins for genetic studies as well.,So I tried that, I tried many techniques.,All it was doing was breaking my arrows,,because the shark's skinnis just so strong.,There was no way we were goingnto get a sample from that.,That wasn't going to work. 
 So when I saw the black slimenon the bow of the boat,,I thought, "If you takenwhat you're given in this world ...",So I scraped it off.,I had a little tube with alcohol in itnto send to the geneticists.,So I scraped the slime offnand sent it to Aberdeen,,and said, "You might try that.",And they sat on it for months.,It was only because we hadna conference on the Isle of Man.,But I kept emailing Les, saying,,"Have you had a chancento look at my slime?",And he was like, "Yeah, yeah. Later.",He thought he'd better do itnbecause I never met him before;,he might lose face if he hadn't donenthe thing I sent him. 
 And he was amazed that they actuallyngot DNA from the slime.,They amplified it and they tested it,,and they found, yes,nthis was actually basking shark DNA,,which was got from the slime.,So he was very excited.,It became known as "Simon's shark slime.",And I thought, "Hey, you know,nI can build on this.",So we thought, OK, we're going to trynto get out and get some slime.,So having spent three-and-a-halfnthousand on satellite tags ...,I then thought I'd invest 7.95 --nthe price is still on it --,in my local hardware store in Kilrush,for a mop handle,,and even less money on some oven cleaners.,And I wrapped the oven cleanernaround the edge of the mop handle,and ... 
 (Laughter) 
 I was desperate to have an opportunitynto get some sharks.,And this was into August now,nand normally sharks peak in June, July,,and you rarely see them,nor rarely can be in the right place,to find sharks into August.,We were desperate,nso we rushed out to the Blaskets,as soon as we heardnthere were sharks there,,and managed to find some sharks.,So by just rubbingnthe mop handle down the shark,as it swam under the boat --,you see a sharknrunning under the boat here --,we managed to collect slime.,And here it is.,Look at that lovely black shark slime.,And in about half an hour,nwe got five samples.,Five individual sharks were sampled,using Simon's Shark Slime Sampling System. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 I've been working on whales and dolphinsnin Ireland for 20 years now,,and they're a bit more dramatic.,You probably sawnthe humpback whale footage,we got a month or two agonoff County Wexford.,And you always thinknyou might have some legacy,you can leave the world behind,,and I was thinking of humpbacknwhales breaching and dolphins.,But hey -- sometimesnthese things are sent to you,and you just have to take themnwhen they come.,So this is possiblyngoing to be my legacy --,Simon's Shark Slime. 
 We got more money this year,to carry on collectingnmore and more samples.,One thing that is very usefulnis that we use a pole camera --,this is my colleague, Joanne,nwith a pole camera --,where you can look underneath the shark.,What you're trying to look at is,nthe males have claspers,,which kind of dangle outnbehind the back of the shark.,So you can quite easily tellnthe gender of the shark.,If we can tell the gender of the sharknbefore we sample it,,we can tell the geneticistnthis was taken from a male or a female.,Because in the moment,nthey have no way, genetically,,of telling the differencenbetween a male and a female,,which I find staggering,,because they don't knownwhat primers to look for.,Being able to tell the gender of a shark,is very importantnfor things like policing the trade,in basking shark and other speciesnthrough the sightings,,because it is illegalnto trade in these sharks.,And they are caught and are on the market. 
 So as a field biologist,,you just want to get encountersnwith these animals,,and learn as much as you can.,They're often quite brief,nthey're often very seasonally constrained.,You just want to learn as muchnas you can as soon as you can.,But isn't it fantastic,that you can then offernthese samples and opportunities,to other disciplines,nsuch as the geneticists,,who can gain so much more from that. 
 So as I said, these thingsnare sent to you in strange ways.,Grab them while you can.,I'll take that as my scientific legacy.,Hopefully, I might get somethingna bit more dramatic and romantic,before I die.,But for the time being,nthank you for that.,And keep an eye out for sharks. 
 If you're more interested, we havena basking shark website now set up.,So thank you and thank you for listening. 
 (Applause)Sustainability represents,the what, the where and the how,of what is caught.,The who and the why are what's important to me.,I want to know the people behind my dinner choices.,I want to know how I impact them.,I want to know how they impact me.,I want to know why they fish.,I want to know how they rely on the water's bounty,for their living.,Understanding all of this enables us,to shift our perception of seafood,away from a commodity,to an opportunity,to restore our ecosystem.,It allows for us to celebrate the seafood,that we're also so fortunate to eat. 
 So what do we call this?,I think we call it restorative seafood.,Where sustainability is the capacity,to endure and maintain,,restorative is the ability to replenish and progress.,Restorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system,and acknowledges our relationship with the ocean,as a resource,,suggesting that we engage to replenish the ocean,and to encourage its resiliency.,It is a more hopeful, it is a more human,,and is a more useful way of understanding our environment. 
 Wallet guides -- standard issue,by lots in the marine conservation world --,are very handy; they're a wonderful tool.,Green, yellow and red lists [of] seafood species.,The association is very easy: buy green, don't buy red,,think twice about yellow.,But in my mind, it's really not enough,to just eat green list.,We can't sustain this without the measure of our success,really changing the fate of the species,in the yellow and the red.,But what if we eat only in the green list?,You've got pole-caught yellowfin tuna here --,comes from sustainable stocks.,Pole caught -- no bycatch.,Great for fishermen. Lots of money. Supporting local economies.,But it's a lion of the sea. It's a top predator. 
 What's the context of this meal?,Am I sitting down in a steakhouse to a 16-ounce portion of this?,Do I do this three times a week?,I might still be in the green list,,but I'm not doing myself, or you,,or the oceans any favors.,The point is that we have to have a context,,a gauge for our actions in all this.,Example: I've heard that red wine is great for my health --,antioxidants and minerals -- heart healthy.,That's great! I love red wine!,I'm going to drink so much of it. I'm going to be so healthy.,Well, how many bottles is it,before you tell me that I have a problem?,Well folks, we have a protein problem.,We have lost this sensibility,when it regards our food,,and we are paying a cost.,The problem is we are hiding that cost beneath the waves.,We are hiding that cost,behind the social acceptance of expanding waistlines.,And we are hiding that cost behind monster profits. 
 So the first thing about this idea of restorative seafood,is that it really takes into account our needs.,Restorative seafood might best be represented,not by Jaws, or by Flipper, or the Gordon's fisherman,,but rather, by the Jolly Green Giant.,Vegetables:,they might yet save the oceans.,Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green.,Well I'd like to respectfully submit,that broccoli green might then be the new blue.,We must continue to eat,the best seafood possible, if at all.,But we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables.,The best part about restorative seafood though,is that it comes on the half-shell,with a bottle of Tabasco and lemon wedges.,It comes in a five-ounce portion of tilapia,breaded with Dijon mustard and crispy, broiled breadcrumbs,and a steaming pile of pecan quinoa pilaf,with crunchy, grilled broccoli,so soft and sweet and charred and smoky on the outside,with just a hint of chili flake.,Whooo!,This is an easy sell.,And the best part is all of those ingredients are available,to every family at the neighborhood Walmart. 
 Jamie Oliver is campaigning,to save America from the way we eat.,Sylvia is campaigning to save the oceans,from the way we eat.,There's a pattern here.,Forget nuclear holocaust;,it's the fork that we have to worry about.,We have ravaged our Earth,and then used the food that we've sourced,to handicap ourselves in more ways than one.,So I think we have this whole eating thing wrong.,And so I think it's time,we change what we expect from our food.,Sustainability is complicated,but dinner is a reality that we all very much understand.,So let's start there. 
 There's been a lot of movement recently in greening our food systems.,Dan Barber and Alice Waters,are leading passionately the green food Delicious Revolution.,But green foods often represent,a way for us to disregard,the responsibility as eaters.,Just because it comes from a green source,doesn't mean we can treat it with disregard on the plate.,We have eco-friendly shrimp.,We can make them; we have that technology.,But we can never have any eco-friendly all-you-can-eat shrimp buffet.,It doesn't work.,Heart-healthy dinner is a very important part,of restorative seafood.,While we try to manage declining marine populations,,the media's recommending increased consumption of seafood.,Studies say that tens of thousands,of American grandmothers, grandfathers, mothers and fathers,might be around for another birthday,if we included more seafood.,That's a reward I am not willing to pass up.,But it's not all about the seafood.,It's about the way that we look at our plates. 
 As a chef, I realize the easiest thing for me to do,is reduce the portion sizes on my plate.,A couple things happened.,I made more money.,People started buying appetizers and salads,,because they knew they weren't going to fill up on the entrees alone.,People spent more time engaging in their meals,,engaging with each other over their meals.,People got, in short, more of what they came there for,even though they got less protein.,They got more calories over the course of a diversified meal.,They got healthier. I made more money.,This is great.,Environmental consideration was served with every plate,,but it was served with a heaping mound,of consideration for human interests at the same time. 
 One of the other things we did,was begin to diversify the species that we served --,small silverfish, anchovies, mackerel, sardines were uncommon.,Shellfish, mussels, oysters,,clams, tilapia, char -- these were the common species.,We were directing tastes,towards more resilience, more restorative options.,This is what we need to favor.,This is what the green list says.,But this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment. 
 But what of those big predators,,those fashionable species,,that green list tuna that I was talking about earlier?,Well, if you must, I have a recipe for you.,It pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean,,so here we go.,Start with a 16-ounce portion of big fish.,Get a knife. Cut it into four portions.,Put it on four plates.,Mound up those four plates with vegetables,and then open up the very best bottle of Burgundy you have,,light the candles and celebrate it.,Celebrate the opportunity you have to eat this.,Invite your friends and neighbors over,and repeat once a year,,maybe. 
 I expect a lot from food.,I expect health,and joy and family and community.,I expect that producing ingredients,,preparing dishes and eating meals,is all part of the communion of human interests.,I was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook.,And he taught me very early on,about the privilege that eating represents.,I remember well the meals of my childhood.,They were reasonable portions of protein,served with copious quantities of vegetables,and small amounts of starch, usually rice.,This is still how I largely eat today.,I get sick when I go to steakhouses.,I get the meat sweats.,It's like a hangover from protein.,It's disgusting.,But of all the dire news that you'll hear,and that you have heard about the state of our oceans,,I have the unfortunate burden of delivering to you,possibly the very worst of it,and that is this whole time,your mother was right.,Eat your vegetables.,It's pretty straightforward. 
 So what are we looking for in a meal?,Well for health, I'm looking for wholesome ingredients,that are good for my body.,For joy, I'm looking for butter and salt,and sexy things that make things taste less like penance.,For family, I'm looking for recipes,that genuflect to my own personal histories.,For community though, we start at the very beginning.,There's no escaping the fact,that everything we eat has a global impact.,So try and learn as best you can what that impact is,and then take the first step to minimize it.,We've seen an image of our blue planet,,our world bank.,But it is more than just a repository of our resources;,it's also the global geography,of the communion we call dinner.,So if we all take only what we need,,then we can begin to share the rest,,we can begin to celebrate,,we can begin to restore.,We need to savor vegetables.,We need to savor smaller portions of seafood.,And we need to save dinner. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I first became fascinated with octopus at an early age.,I grew up in Mobile, Alabama --,somebody's got to be from Mobile, right? --,and Mobile sits at the confluence of five rivers,,forming this beautiful delta.,And the delta has alligators crawling,in and out of rivers filled with fish,and cypress trees dripping with snakes,,birds of every flavor.,It's an absolute magical wonderland to live in --,if you're a kid interested in animals, to grow up in.,And this delta water flows to Mobile Bay, and finally into the Gulf of Mexico. 
 And I remember my first real contact with octopus,was probably at age five or six.,I was in the gulf, and I was swimming around and saw a little octopus on the bottom.,And I reached down and picked him up, and immediately,became fascinated and impressed by its speed and its strength and agility.,It was prying my fingers apart and moving to the back of my hand.,It was all I could do to hold onto this amazing creature.,Then it sort of calmed down in the palms of my hands,and started flashing colors,,just pulsing all of these colors.,And as I looked at it, it kind of tucked its arms under it,,raised into a spherical shape,and turned chocolate brown with two white stripes.,I'm going, "My gosh!" I had never seen anything like this in my life!,So I marveled for a moment, and then decided it was time to release him,,so I put him down.,The octopus left my hands and then did the damnedest thing:,It landed on the bottom in the rubble,and -- fwoosh! -- vanished,right before my eyes. 
 And I knew, right then, at age six,,that is an animal that I want to learn more about. So I did.,And I went off to college and got a degree in marine zoology,,and then moved to Hawaii and entered graduate school,at the University of Hawaii.,And while a student at Hawaii, I worked at the Waikiki Aquarium.,And the aquarium had a lot of big fish tanks,but not a lot of invertebrate displays,,and being the spineless guy, I thought, well,I'll just go out in the field and collect these wonderful animals,I had been learning about as a student,and bring them in, and I built these elaborate sets and put them on display. 
 Now, the fish in the tanks were gorgeous to look at,,but they didn't really interact with people.,But the octopus did.,If you walked up to an octopus tank,,especially early in the morning before anyone arrived,,the octopus would rise up and look at you,and you're thinking, "Is that guy really looking at me? He is looking at me!",And you walk up to the front of the tank. Then you realize,that these animals all have different personalities:,Some of them would hold their ground,,others would slink into the back of the tank and disappear in the rocks,,and one in particular, this amazing animal ...,I went up to the front of the tank, and he's just staring at me,,and he had little horns come up above his eyes.,So I went right up to the front of the tank --,I was three or four inches from the front glass --,and the octopus was sitting on a perch, a little rock,,and he came off the rock and he also came down right to the front of the glass.,So I was staring at this animal about six or seven inches away,,and at that time I could actually focus that close;,now as I look at my fuzzy fingers I realize those days are long gone.,Anyway, there we were, staring at each other,,and he reaches down and grabs an armful of gravel,and releases it in the jet of water entering the tank,from the filtration system,,and -- chk chk chk chk chk! -- this gravel hits the front of the glass and falls down.,He reaches up, takes another armful of gravel, releases it --,chk chk chk chk chk! -- same thing.,Then he lifts another arm and I lift an arm.,Then he lifts another arm and I lift another arm.,And then I realize the octopus won the arms race,,because I was out and he had six left. (Laughter),But the only way I can describe what I was seeing that day,was that this octopus was playing,,which is a pretty sophisticated behavior for a mere invertebrate. 
 So, about three years into my degree,,a funny thing happened on the way to the office,,which actually changed the course of my life.,A man came into the aquarium. It's a long story, but essentially,he sent me and a couple of friends of mine to the South Pacific,to collect animals for him,,and as we left, he gave us two 16-millimeter movie cameras.,He said, "Make a movie about this expedition.","OK, a couple of biologists making a movie --,this'll be interesting,",and off we went. And we did, we made a movie,,which had to be the worst movie ever made,in the history of movie making,,but it was a blast. I had so much fun.,And I remember that proverbial light going off in my head,,thinking, "Wait a minute.,Maybe I can do this all the time.,Yeah, I'll be a filmmaker.",So I literally came back from that job,,quit school, hung my filmmaking shingle,and just never told anyone that I didn't know what I was doing.,It's been a good ride.,And what I learned in school though was really beneficial.,If you're a wildlife filmmaker,and you're going out into the field to film animals,,especially behavior,,it helps to have a fundamental background,on who these animals are,,how they work and, you know, a bit about their behaviors. 
 But where I really learned about octopus,was in the field, as a filmmaker,making films with them,,where you're allowed to spend large periods of time,with the animals, seeing octopus being octopus,in their ocean homes.,I remember I took a trip to Australia,,went to an island called One Tree Island.,And apparently, evolution had occurred,at a pretty rapid rate on One Tree,,between the time they named it and the time I arrived,,because I'm sure there were at least three trees,on that island when we were there.,Anyway, one tree is situated right next to,a beautiful coral reef.,In fact, there's a surge channel,where the tide is moving back and forth, twice a day, pretty rapidly.,And there's a beautiful reef,,very complex reef, with lots of animals,,including a lot of octopus.,And not uniquely,but certainly, the octopus in Australia,are masters at camouflage.,As a matter of fact,,there's one right there.,So our first challenge was to find these things,,and that was a challenge, indeed.,But the idea is, we were there for a month,and I wanted to acclimate the animals to us,so that we could see behaviors without disturbing them.,So the first week was pretty much spent,just getting as close as we could,,every day a little closer, a little closer, a little closer.,And you knew what the limit was: they would start getting twitchy,and you'd back up, come back in a few hours.,And after the first week, they ignored us.,It was like, "I don't know what that thing is, but he's no threat to me.",So they went on about their business,and from a foot away, we're watching mating,and courting and fighting,and it is just an unbelievable experience. 
 And one of the most fantastic displays,that I remember, or at least visually,,was a foraging behavior.,And they had a lot of different techniques,that they would use for foraging,,but this particular one used vision.,And they would see a coral head,,maybe 10 feet away,,and start moving over toward that coral head.,And I don't know whether they actually saw crab in it, or imagined that one might be,,but whatever the case, they would leap off the bottom,and go through the water and land right on top of this coral head,,and then the web between the arms,would completely engulf the coral head,,and they would fish out, swim for crabs.,And as soon as the crabs touched the arm, it was lights out.,And I always wondered what happened under that web.,So we created a way to find out, (Laughter),and I got my first look at that famous beak in action.,It was fantastic. 
 If you're going to make a lot of films about a particular group of animals,,you might as well pick one that's fairly common.,And octopus are, they live in all the oceans.,They also live deep.,And I can't say octopus are responsible,for my really strong interest,in getting in subs and going deep,,but whatever the case, I like that.,It's like nothing you've ever done. 
 If you ever really want to get away from it all,and see something that you have never seen,,and have an excellent chance of seeing something,no one has ever seen, get in a sub.,You climb in, seal the hatch, turn on a little oxygen,,turn on the scrubber,,which removes the CO2 in the air you breathe, and they chuck you overboard.,Down you go. There's no connection to the surface,apart from a pretty funky radio.,And as you go down, the washing machine,at the surface calms down.,And it gets quiet.,And it starts getting really nice.,And as you go deeper, that lovely, blue water you were launched in,gives way to darker and darker blue.,And finally, it's a rich lavender,,and after a couple of thousand feet, it's ink black.,And now you've entered the realm,of the mid-water community. 
 You could give an entire talk,about the creatures that live in the mid-water.,Suffice to say though, as far as I'm concerned,,without question, the most bizarre designs,and outrageous behaviors,are in the animals that live in the mid-water community.,But we're just going to zip right past this area,,this area that includes about 95 percent,of the living space on our planet,and go to the mid-ocean ridge, which I think is even more extraordinary. 
 The mid-ocean ridge is a huge mountain range,,40,000 miles long, snaking around the entire globe.,And they're big mountains, thousands of feet tall,,some of which are tens of thousands of feet,and bust through the surface,,creating islands like Hawaii.,And the top of this mountain range,is splitting apart, creating a rift valley.,And when you dive into that rift valley, that's where the action is,because literally thousands of active volcanoes,are going off at any point in time,all along this 40,000 mile range.,And as these tectonic plates are spreading apart,,magma, lava is coming up and filling those gaps,,and you're looking land -- new land --,being created right before your eyes.,And over the tops of them is 3,000 to 4,000 meters of water,creating enormous pressure,,forcing water down through the cracks toward the center of the earth,,until it hits a magma chamber,where it becomes superheated,and supersaturated with minerals,,reverses its flow and starts shooting back to the surface,and is ejected out of the earth like a geyser at Yellowstone.,In fact, this whole area,is like a Yellowstone National Park with all of the trimmings. 
 And this vent fluid is about 600 or 700 degrees F.,The surrounding water is just a couple of degrees above freezing.,So it immediately cools,,and it can no longer hold in suspension,all of the material that it's dissolved,,and it precipitates out, forming black smoke.,And it forms these towers, these chimneys,that are 10, 20, 30 feet tall.,And all along the sides of these chimneys,is shimmering with heat and loaded with life.,You've got black smokers going all over the place,and chimneys that have tube worms,that might be eight to 10 feet long.,And out of the tops of these tube worms,are these beautiful red plumes.,And living amongst the tangle of tube worms,is an entire community of animals:,shrimp, fish, lobsters, crab,,clams and swarms of arthropods,that are playing that dangerous game,between over here is scalding hot and freezing cold. 
 And this whole ecosystem,wasn't even known about,until 33 years ago.,And it completely threw science on its head.,It made scientists rethink,where life on Earth might have actually begun.,And before the discovery of these vents,,all life on Earth, the key to life on Earth,,was believed to be the sun and photosynthesis.,But down there, there is no sun,,there is no photosynthesis;,it's chemosynthetic environment down there driving it,,and it's all so ephemeral.,You might film this,unbelievable hydrothermal vent,,which you think at the time has to be on another planet.,It's amazing to think that this is actually on earth;,it looks like aliens in an alien environment.,But you go back to the same vent eight years later,and it can be completely dead.,There's no hot water.,All of the animals are gone, they're dead,,and the chimneys are still there,creating a really nice ghost town,,an eerie, spooky ghost town,,but essentially devoid of animals, of course.,But 10 miles down the ridge...,pshhh! There's another volcano going.,And there's a whole new hydrothermal vent community that has been formed.,And this kind of life and death of hydrothermal vent communities,is going on every 30 or 40 years,all along the ridge. 
 And that ephemeral nature,of the hydrothermal vent community,isn't really different from some of the,areas that I've seen,in 35 years of traveling around, making films.,Where you go and film a really nice sequence at a bay.,And you go back, and I'm at home,,and I'm thinking, "Okay, what can I shoot ...,Ah! I know where I can shoot that.,There's this beautiful bay, lots of soft corals and stomatopods.",And you show up, and it's dead.,There's no coral, algae growing on it, and the water's pea soup.,You think, "Well, what happened?",And you turn around,,and there's a hillside behind you with a neighborhood going in,,and bulldozers are pushing piles of soil back and forth.,And over here,there's a golf course going in.,And this is the tropics.,It's raining like crazy here.,So this rainwater is flooding down the hillside,,carrying with it sediments from the construction site,,smothering the coral and killing it.,And fertilizers and pesticides,are flowing into the bay from the golf course --,the pesticides killing all the larvae and little animals,,fertilizer creating this beautiful plankton bloom --,and there's your pea soup. 
 But, encouragingly, I've seen just the opposite.,I've been to a place that was a pretty trashed bay.,And I looked at it, just said, "Yuck,",and go and work on the other side of the island.,Five years later, come back,,and that same bay is now gorgeous. It's beautiful.,It's got living coral, fish all over the place,,crystal clear water, and you go, "How did that happen?",Well, how it happened is,the local community galvanized.,They recognized what was happening on the hillside and put a stop to it;,enacted laws and made permits required,to do responsible construction,and golf course maintenance,and stopped the sediments flowing into the bay,,and stopped the chemicals flowing into the bay,,and the bay recovered.,The ocean has an amazing ability,to recover, if we'll just leave it alone. 
 I think Margaret Mead,said it best.,She said that a small group of thoughtful people,could change the world.,Indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.,And a small group of thoughtful people,changed that bay.,I'm a big fan of grassroots organizations.,I've been to a lot of lectures,where, at the end of it, inevitably,,one of the first questions that comes up is,,"But, but what can I do?,I'm an individual. I'm one person.,And these problems are so large and global, and it's just overwhelming.",Fair enough question. 
 My answer to that is don't look,at the big, overwhelming issues of the world.,Look in your own backyard.,Look in your heart, actually.,What do you really care about that isn't right where you live?,And fix it.,Create a healing zone in your neighborhood,and encourage others to do the same.,And maybe these healing zones can sprinkle a map,,little dots on a map.,And in fact, the way that we can communicate today --,where Alaska is instantly knowing what's going on in China,,and the Kiwis did this, and then over in England they tried to ...,and everybody is talking to everyone else --,it's not isolated points on a map anymore,,it's a network we've created.,And maybe these healing zones can start growing,,and possibly even overlap, and good things can happen.,So that's how I answer that question.,Look in your own backyard, in fact, look in the mirror.,What can you do that is more responsible,than what you're doing now?,And do that, and spread the word.,The vent community animals,can't really do much,about the life and death,that's going on where they live, but up here we can.,In theory, we're thinking, rational human beings.,And we can make changes to our behavior,that will influence and affect the environment,,like those people changed the health of that bay. 
 Now, Sylvia's TED Prize wish,was to beseech us to do anything we could,,everything we could,,to set aside not pin pricks,,but significant expanses,of the ocean for preservation,,"hope spots," she calls them.,And I applaud that. I loudly applaud that.,And it's my hope that some of these "hope spots",can be in the deep ocean,,an area that has historically,been seriously neglected, if not abused.,The term "deep six" comes to mind:,"If it's too big or too toxic for a landfill,,deep six it!",So, I hope that we can also keep,some of these "hope spots" in the deep sea.,Now, I don't get a wish,,but I certainly can say,that I will do anything I can,to support Sylvia Earle's wish.,And that I do. 
 Thank you very much. (Applause)Hi, my name is Roz Savage,and I row across oceans.,Four years ago, I rowed solo across the Atlantic,,and since then, I've done two out of three stages,across the Pacific,,from San Francisco to Hawaii,and from Hawaii to Kiribati.,And tomorrow, I'll be leaving this boat,to fly back to Kiribati,to continue with the third and final stage,of my row across the Pacific.,Cumulatively, I will have rowed,over 8,000 miles,,taken over three million oar strokes,and spent more than 312 days alone,on the ocean on a 23 foot rowboat.,This has given me a very,special relationship with the ocean.,We have a bit of a love/hate thing going on.,I feel a bit about it like I did about,a very strict math teacher that I once had at school.,I didn't always like her, but I did respect her,,and she taught me a heck of a lot.,So today I'd like to share with you,some of my ocean adventures,and tell you a little bit about what they've taught me,,and how I think we can maybe take some of those lessons,and apply them to this environmental challenge,that we face right now. 
 Now, some of you might be thinking,,"Hold on a minute. She doesn't look very much like an ocean rower.,Isn't she meant to be about this tall,and about this wide,and maybe look a bit more like these guys?",You'll notice, they've all got something that I don't.,Well, I don't know what you're thinking, but I'm talking about the beards. (Laughter),And no matter how long I've spent on the ocean,,I haven't yet managed to muster a decent beard,,and I hope that it remains that way. 
 For a long time, I didn't believe that I could have a big adventure.,The story that I told myself was,that adventurers looked like this.,I didn't look the part.,I thought there were them and there were us,,and I was not one of them.,So for 11 years, I conformed.,I did what people from my kind of background were supposed to do.,I was working in an office in London,as a management consultant.,And I think I knew from day one that it wasn't the right job for me.,But that kind of conditioning,just kept me there for so many years,,until I reached my mid-30s and I thought,,"You know, I'm not getting any younger.,I feel like I've got a purpose in this life, and I don't know what it is,,but I'm pretty certain that management consultancy is not it. 
 So, fast forward a few years.,I'd gone through some changes.,To try and answer that question of,,"What am I supposed to be doing with my life?",I sat down one day,and wrote two versions of my own obituary,,the one that I wanted, a life of adventure,,and the one that I was actually heading for,which was a nice, normal, pleasant life,,but it wasn't where I wanted to be by the end of my life.,I wanted to live a life that I could be proud of.,And I remember looking at these two versions of my obituary,and thinking, "Oh boy,,I'm on totally the wrong track here.,If I carry on living as I am now,,I'm just not going to end up where I want to be,in five years, or 10 years,,or at the end of my life.",I made a few changes,,let go of some loose trappings of my old life,,and through a bit of a leap of logic,,decided to row across the Atlantic Ocean. 
 (Laughter) 
 The Atlantic Rowing Race runs from the Canaries to Antigua,,it's about 3,000 miles,,and it turned out to be,the hardest thing I had ever done.,Sure, I had wanted to get outside of my comfort zone,,but what I'd sort of failed to notice was that,getting out of your comfort zone is, by definition,,extremely uncomfortable.,And my timing was not great either:,2005, when I did the Atlantic,,was the year of Hurricane Katrina.,There were more tropical storms in the North Atlantic,than ever before, since records began.,And pretty early on,,those storms started making their presence known. 
 All four of my oars broke,before I reached halfway across.,Oars are not supposed to look like this.,But what can you do? You're in the middle of the ocean.,Oars are your only means of propulsion.,So I just had to look around the boat,and figure out what I was going to use,to fix up these oars so that I could carry on.,So I found a boat hook and my trusty duct tape,and splintered the boat hook,to the oars to reinforce it.,Then, when that gave out,,I sawed the wheel axles off my spare rowing seat,and used those.,And then when those gave out, I cannibalized one of the broken oars.,I'd never been very good at fixing stuff,when I was living my old life,,but it's amazing how resourceful you can become,when you're in the middle of the ocean,and there's only one way to get to the other side. 
 And the oars kind of became a symbol,of just in how many ways,I went beyond what I thought were my limits.,I suffered from tendinitis on my shoulders,and saltwater sores on my bottom.,I really struggled psychologically,,totally overwhelmed by the scale of the challenge,,realizing that, if I carried on moving at two miles an hour,,3,000 miles was going to,take me a very, very long time.,There were so many times,when I thought I'd hit that limit,,but had no choice but to just carry on,and try and figure out how I was going to get to the other side,without driving myself crazy. 
 And eventually after,103 days at sea,,I arrived in Antigua.,I don't think I've ever felt so happy,in my entire life.,It was a bit like finishing a marathon,and getting out of solitary confinement,and winning an Oscar all rolled into one.,I was euphoric.,And to see all the people coming out to greet me,and standing along the cliff tops and clapping and cheering,,I just felt like a movie star.,It was absolutely wonderful.,And I really learned then that, the bigger the challenge,,the bigger the sense of achievement,when you get to the end of it. 
 So this might be a good moment to take a quick time-out,to answer a few FAQs about ocean rowing,that might be going through your mind.,Number one that I get asked: What do you eat?,A few freeze-dried meals, but mostly I try and eat,much more unprocessed foods.,So I grow my own beansprouts.,I eat fruits and nut bars,,a lot of nuts.,And generally arrive about 30 pounds lighter,at the other end.,Question number two: How do you sleep?,With my eyes shut. Ha-ha.,I suppose what you mean is:,What happens to the boat while I'm sleeping?,Well, I plan my route so that I'm drifting,with the winds and the currents while I'm sleeping.,On a good night, I think my best ever was 11 miles,in the right direction.,Worst ever, 13 miles in the wrong direction.,That's a bad day at the office.,What do I wear?,Mostly, a baseball cap,,rowing gloves and a smile -- or a frown,,depending on whether I went backwards overnight --,and lots of sun lotion.,Do I have a chase boat?,No I don't. I'm totally self-supporting out there.,I don't see anybody for the whole time,that I'm at sea, generally.,And finally: Am I crazy?,Well, I leave that one up to you to judge. 
 So, how do you top rowing across the Atlantic?,Well, naturally, you decide to row across the Pacific.,Well, I thought the Atlantic was big,,but the Pacific is really, really big.,I think we tend to do it a little bit of a disservice in our usual maps.,I don't know for sure that the Brits,invented this particular view of the world, but I suspect we might have done so:,we are right in the middle,,and we've cut the Pacific in half,and flung it to the far corners of the world.,Whereas if you look in Google Earth,,this is how the Pacific looks.,It pretty much covers half the planet.,You can just see a little bit of North America up here,and a sliver of Australia down there.,It is really big --,65 million square miles --,and to row in a straight line across it,would be about 8,000 miles.,Unfortunately, ocean rowboats,very rarely go in a straight line.,By the time I get to Australia,,if I get to Australia,,I will have rowed probably nine or 10,000 miles in all. 
 So, because nobody in their straight mind would row,straight past Hawaii without dropping in,,I decided to cut this very big undertaking,into three segments.,The first attempt didn't go so well.,In 2007, I did a rather involuntary capsize drill,three times in 24 hours.,A bit like being in a washing machine.,Boat got a bit dinged up,,so did I.,I blogged about it. Unfortunately, somebody,with a bit of a hero complex decided that,this damsel was in distress and needed saving.,The first I knew about this was when the Coast Guard plane turned up overhead.,I tried to tell them to go away.,We had a bit of a battle of wills.,I lost and got airlifted.,Awful, really awful.,It was one of the worst feelings of my life,,as I was lifted up on that winch line into the helicopter,and looked down at my trusty little boat,rolling around in the 20 foot waves,and wondering if I would ever see her again.,So I had to launch a very expensive,salvage operation,and then wait another nine months,before I could get back out onto the ocean again. 
 But what do you do?,Fall down nine times, get up 10.,So, the following year, I set out,and, fortunately, this time made it safely across to Hawaii.,But it was not without misadventure.,My watermaker broke,,only the most important piece of kit that I have on the boat.,Powered by my solar panels,,it sucks in saltwater,and turns it into freshwater.,But it doesn't react very well to being immersed in ocean,,which is what happened to it.,Fortunately, help was at hand. 
 There was another unusual boat out there,at the same time, doing as I was doing,,bringing awareness to the North Pacific Garbage Patch,,that area in the North Pacific about twice the size of Texas,,with an estimated 3.5 million,tons of trash in it,,circulating at the center of,that North Pacific Gyre.,So, to make the point, these guys,had actually built their boat out of plastic trash,,15,000 empty water bottles,latched together into two pontoons.,They were going very slowly.,Partly, they'd had a bit of a delay.,They'd had to pull in at Catalina Island shortly after they left Long Beach,because the lids of all the water bottles were coming undone,,and they were starting to sink.,So they'd had to pull in and do all the lids up. 
 But, as I was approaching the end of my water reserves,,luckily, our courses were converging.,They were running out of food; I was running out of water.,So we liaised by satellite phone and arranged to meet up.,And it took about a week,for us to actually gradually converge.,I was doing a pathetically slow speed,of about 1.3 knots,,and they were doing only marginally less pathetic speed of about 1.4:,it was like two snails in a mating dance.,But, eventually, we did manage to meet up,and Joel hopped overboard,,caught us a beautiful, big mahi-mahi,,which was the best food I'd had,in, ooh, at least three months. 
 Fortunately, the one that he caught that day,was better than this one they caught a few weeks earlier.,When they opened this one up,,they found its stomach was full of plastic.,And this is really bad news because plastic,is not an inert substance.,It leaches out chemicals,into the flesh of the poor critter that ate it,,and then we come along and eat that poor critter,,and we get some of the toxins accumulating,in our bodies as well.,So there are very real implications for human health. 
 I eventually made it to Hawaii still alive.,And, the following year, set out,on the second stage of the Pacific,,from Hawaii down to Tarawa.,And you'll notice something about Tarawa;,it is very low-lying.,It's that little green sliver on the horizon,,which makes them very nervous,about rising oceans.,This is big trouble for these guys.,They've got no points of land more than about six feet above sea level.,And also, as an increase in extreme,weather events due to climate change,,they're expecting more waves,to come in over the fringing reef,,which will contaminate their fresh water supply.,I had a meeting with the president there,,who told me about his,exit strategy for his country.,He expects that within the next 50 years,,the 100,000 people that live there,will have to relocate to,New Zealand or Australia.,And that made me think about how would I feel,if Britain was going to disappear under the waves;,if the places where I'd been born,and gone to school,and got married,,if all those places were just going to disappear forever.,How, literally, ungrounded,that would make me feel. 
 Very shortly, I'll be setting out to try and get to Australia,,and if I'm successful, I'll be the first woman ever to row solo,all the way across the Pacific.,And I try to use this to bring awareness to these environmental issues,,to bring a human face to the ocean.,If the Atlantic was about my inner journey,,discovering my own capabilities,,maybe the Pacific has been about my outer journey,,figuring out how I can use,my interesting career choice,to be of service to the world,,and to take some of those things that I've learned out there,and apply them to the situation,that humankind now finds itself in. 
 I think there are probably three key points here.,The first one is about,the stories that we tell ourselves.,For so long, I told myself,that I couldn't have an adventure,because I wasn't six foot tall,and athletic and bearded.,And then that story changed.,I found out that people had rowed across oceans.,I even met one of them and she was just about my size.,So even though I didn't grow any taller,,I didn't sprout a beard,,something had changed: My interior dialogue had changed.,At the moment, the story that we collectively tell ourselves,is that we need all this stuff,,that we need oil.,But what about if we just change that story?,We do have alternatives,,and we have the power of free will,to choose those alternatives, those sustainable ones,,to create a greener future. 
 The second point is about,the accumulation of tiny actions.,We might think that anything that we do as an individual,is just a drop in the ocean, that it can't really make a difference.,But it does. Generally, we haven't,got ourselves into this mess through big disasters.,Yes, there have been the Exxon Valdezes,and the Chernobyls,,but mostly it's been an accumulation,of bad decisions,by billions of individuals,,day after day and year after year.,And, by the same token, we can turn that tide.,We can start making better,,wiser, more sustainable decisions.,And when we do that, we're not just one person.,Anything that we do spreads ripples.,Other people will see if you're in the supermarket line,and you pull out your,reusable grocery bag.,Maybe if we all start doing this,,we can make it socially unacceptable,to say yes to plastic in the checkout line.,That's just one example.,This is a world-wide community. 
 The other point:,It's about taking responsibility.,For so much of my life,,I wanted something else to make me happy.,I thought if I had the right house or the right car,or the right man in my life,,then I could be happy.,But when I wrote that obituary exercise,,I actually grew up a little bit in that moment,and realized that I needed to create my own future.,I couldn't just wait passively,for happiness to come and find me.,And I suppose I'm a selfish environmentalist.,I plan on being around for a long time,,and when I'm 90 years old,,I want to be happy and healthy.,And it's very difficult to be happy,on a planet that's racked,with famine and drought.,It's very difficult to be healthy on a planet,where we've poisoned the earth,and the sea and the air. 
 So, shortly, I'm going to be,launching a new initiative,called Eco-Heroes.,And the idea here is that,all our Eco-Heroes will log at least one green deed every day.,It's meant to be a bit of a game.,We're going to make an iPhone app out of it.,We just want to try and create that awareness,because, sure, changing a light bulb isn't going to change the world,,but that attitude,,that awareness that leads you to change the light bulb,or take your reusable coffee mug,,that is what could change the world. 
 I really believe that we stand,at a very important point in history.,We have a choice. We've been blessed,,or cursed, with free will.,We can choose a greener future,,and we can get there,if we all pull together to take it one stroke at a time. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)In the spirit of Jacques Cousteau, who said,,"People protect what they love,",I want to share with you today what I love most in the ocean,,and that's the incredible number and variety,of animals in it that make light. 
 My addiction began with this strange looking diving suit called Wasp;,that's not an acronym -- just somebody thought it looked like the insect.,It was actually developed for use by the offshore oil industry,for diving on oil rigs down to a depth of 2,000 feet.,Right after I completed my Ph.D.,,I was lucky enough to be included with a group of scientists,that was using it for the first time,as a tool for ocean exploration.,We trained in a tank in Port Hueneme,,and then my first open ocean dive,was in Santa Barbara Channel.,It was an evening dive.,I went down to a depth of 880 feet,and turned out the lights.,And the reason I turned out the lights is because I knew I would see,this phenomenon of animals making light,called bioluminescence.,But I was totally unprepared,for how much there was,and how spectacular it was.,I saw chains of jellyfish called siphonophores,that were longer than this room,,pumping out so much light,that I could read the dials and gauges,inside the suit without a flashlight;,and puffs and billows,of what looked like luminous blue smoke;,and explosions of sparks,that would swirl up out of the thrusters --,just like when you throw a log on a campfire and the embers swirl up off the campfire,,but these were icy, blue embers.,It was breathtaking. 
 Now, usually if people are familiar with bioluminescence at all,,it's these guys; it's fireflies.,And there are a few other land-dwellers that can make light --,some insects, earthworms, fungi --,but in general, on land, it's really rare.,In the ocean, it's the rule,rather than the exception.,If I go out in the open ocean environment,,virtually anywhere in the world,,and I drag a net from 3,000 feet to the surface,,most of the animals --,in fact, in many places, 80 to 90 percent,of the animals that I bring up in that net --,make light.,This makes for some pretty spectacular light shows. 
 Now I want to share with you a little video,that I shot from a submersible.,I first developed this technique working from a little,single-person submersible called Deep Rover,and then adapted it for use on the Johnson Sea-Link,,which you see here.,So, mounted in front of the observation sphere,,there's a a three-foot diameter hoop,with a screen stretched across it.,And inside the sphere with me is an intensified camera,that's about as sensitive as a fully dark-adapted human eye,,albeit a little fuzzy.,So you turn on the camera, turn out the lights.,That sparkle you're seeing is not luminescence,,that's just electronic noise,on these super intensified cameras.,You don't see luminescence until the submersible,begins to move forward through the water,,but as it does, animals bumping into the screen,are stimulated to bioluminesce. 
 Now, when I was first doing this,,all I was trying to do was count the numbers of sources.,I knew my forward speed, I knew the area,,and so I could figure out how many hundreds of sources,there were per cubic meter.,But I started to realize that I could actually identify animals,by the type of flashes they produced.,And so, here, in the Gulf of Maine,at 740 feet,,I can name pretty much everything you're seeing there to the species level.,Like those big explosions, sparks,,are from a little comb jelly,,and there's krill and other kinds of crustaceans,,and jellyfish.,There was another one of those comb jellies.,And so I've worked with computer image analysis engineers,to develop automatic recognition systems,that can identify these animals,and then extract the XYZ coordinate of the initial impact point.,And we can then do the kinds of things that ecologists do on land,,and do nearest neighbor distances. 
 But you don't always have to go down to the depths of the ocean,to see a light show like this.,You can actually see it in surface waters.,This is some shot, by Dr. Mike Latz at Scripps Institution,,of a dolphin swimming through bioluminescent plankton.,And this isn't someplace exotic,like one of the bioluminescent bays in Puerto Rico,,this was actually shot in San Diego Harbor.,And sometimes you can see it even closer than that,,because the heads on ships --,that's toilets, for any land lovers that are listening --,are flushed with unfiltered seawater,that often has bioluminescent plankton in it.,So, if you stagger into the head late at night,and you're so toilet-hugging sick,that you forget to turn on the light,,you may think that you're having a religious experience. (Laughter) 
 So, how does a living creature make light?,Well, that was the question that 19th century,French physiologist Raphael Dubois,,asked about this bioluminescent clam.,He ground it up and he managed to get out a couple of chemicals;,one, the enzyme, he called luciferase;,the substrate, he called luciferin,after Lucifer the Lightbearer.,That terminology has stuck, but it doesn't actually refer to specific chemicals,because these chemicals come in a lot of different shapes and forms.,In fact, most of the people,studying bioluminescence today,are focused on the chemistry, because these chemicals,have proved so incredibly valuable,for developing antibacterial agents,,cancer fighting drugs,,testing for the presence of life on Mars,,detecting pollutants in our waters --,which is how we use it at ORCA.,In 2008,,the Nobel Prize in Chemistry,was awarded for work done,on a molecule called green fluorescent protein,that was isolated from the bioluminescent chemistry,of a jellyfish,,and it's been equated to the invention of the microscope,,in terms of the impact that it has had,on cell biology and genetic engineering. 
 Another thing all these molecules are telling us,that, apparently, bioluminescence has evolved,at least 40 times, maybe as many as 50 separate times,in evolutionary history,,which is a clear indication,of how spectacularly important,this trait is for survival.,So, what is it about bioluminescence,that's so important to so many animals?,Well, for animals that are trying to avoid predators,by staying in the darkness,,light can still be very useful,for the three basic things that animals have to do to survive:,and that's find food,,attract a mate and avoid being eaten.,So, for example, this fish,has a built-in headlight behind its eye,that it can use for finding food,or attracting a mate.,And then when it's not using it, it actually can roll it down into its head,just like the headlights on your Lamborghini.,This fish actually has high beams. 
 And this fish, which is one of my favorites,,has three headlights on each side of its head.,Now, this one is blue,,and that's the color of most bioluminescence in the ocean,because evolution has selected,for the color that travels farthest through seawater,in order to optimize communication.,So, most animals make blue light,,and most animals can only see blue light,,but this fish is a really fascinating exception,because it has two red light organs.,And I have no idea why there's two,,and that's something I want to solve some day --,but not only can it see blue light,,but it can see red light.,So it uses its red bioluminescence like a sniper's scope,to be able to sneak up on animals,that are blind to red light,and be able to see them without being seen.,It's also got a little chin barbel here,with a blue luminescent lure on it,that it can use to attract prey from a long way off.,And a lot of animals will use their bioluminescence as a lure. 
 This is another one of my favorite fish.,This is a viperfish, and it's got a lure,on the end of a long fishing rod,that it arches in front of the toothy jaw,that gives the viperfish its name.,The teeth on this fish are so long,that if they closed inside the mouth of the fish,,it would actually impale its own brain.,So instead, it slides in grooves,on the outside of the head.,This is a Christmas tree of a fish;,everything on this fish lights up,,it's not just that lure.,It's got a built-in flashlight.,It's got these jewel-like light organs on its belly,that it uses for a type of camouflage,that obliterates its shadow,,so when it's swimming around and there's a predator looking up from below,,it makes itself disappear.,It's got light organs in the mouth,,it's got light organs in every single scale, in the fins,,in a mucus layer on the back and the belly,,all used for different things --,some of which we know about, some of which we don't. 
 And we know a little bit more about bioluminescence thanks to Pixar,,and I'm very grateful to Pixar for sharing,my favorite topic with so many people.,I do wish, with their budget,,that they might have spent just a tiny bit more money,to pay a consulting fee to some poor, starving graduate student,,who could have told them that those are the eyes,of a fish that's been preserved in formalin.,These are the eyes of a living anglerfish.,So, she's got a lure that she sticks out,in front of this living mousetrap,of needle-sharp teeth,in order to attract in some unsuspecting prey.,And this one has a lure,with all kinds of little interesting threads coming off it. 
 Now we used to think that the different shape of the lure,was to attract different types of prey,,but then stomach content analyses on these fish,done by scientists, or more likely their graduate students,,have revealed that,they all eat pretty much the same thing.,So, now we believe that the different shape of the lure,is how the male recognizes the female,in the anglerfish world,,because many of these males,are what are known as dwarf males.,This little guy,has no visible means of self-support.,He has no lure for attracting food,and no teeth for eating it when it gets there.,His only hope for existence on this planet,is as a gigolo. (Laughter),He's got to find himself a babe,and then he's got to latch on for life.,So this little guy,has found himself this babe,,and you will note that he's had the good sense,to attach himself in a way that he doesn't actually have to look at her.,(Laughter),But he still knows a good thing when he sees it,,and so he seals the relationship with an eternal kiss.,His flesh fuses with her flesh,,her bloodstream grows into his body,,and he becomes nothing more than a little sperm sac.,(Laughter),Well, this is a deep-sea version of Women's Lib.,She always knows where he is,,and she doesn't have to be monogamous,,because some of these females,come up with multiple males attached. 
 So they can use it for finding food, for attracting mates.,They use it a lot for defense, many different ways.,A lot of them can release their luciferin or luferase in the water,just the way a squid or an octopus will release an ink cloud.,This shrimp is actually,spewing light out of its mouth,like a fire breathing dragon,in order to blind or distract this viperfish,so that the shrimp can swim away into the darkness.,And there are a lot of different animals that can do this:,There's jellyfish, there's squid,,there's a whole lot of different crustaceans, 
 there's even fish that can do this.,This fish is called the shining tubeshoulder,because it actually has a tube on its shoulder,that can squirt out light.,And I was luck enough to capture one of these,when we were on a trawling expedition,off the northwest coast of Africa for "Blue Planet,",for the deep portion of "Blue Planet.",And we were using a special trawling net,that we were able to bring these animals up alive.,So we captured one of these, and I brought it into the lab.,So I'm holding it,,and I'm about to touch that tube on its shoulder,,and when I do, you'll see bioluminescence coming out.,But to me, what's shocking,is not just the amount of light,,but the fact that it's not just luciferin and luciferase.,For this fish, it's actually whole cells,with nuclei and membranes.,It's energetically very costly for this fish to do this,,and we have no idea why it does it --,another one of these great mysteries that needs to be solved. 
 Now, another form of defense,is something called a burglar alarm --,same reason you have a burglar alarm on your car;,the honking horn and flashing lights,are meant to attract the attention of, hopefully,,the police that will come and take the burglar away --,when an animal's caught in the clutches of a predator,,its only hope for escape may be,to attract the attention of something bigger and nastier,that will attack their attacker,,thereby affording them a chance for escape.,This jellyfish, for example, has,a spectacular bioluminescent display.,This is us chasing it in the submersible.,That's not luminescence, that's reflected light from the gonads.,We capture it in a very special device on the front of the submersible,that allows us to bring it up in really pristine condition,,bring it into the lab on the ship.,And then to generate the display you're about to see,,all I did was touch it once per second,on its nerve ring with a sharp pick,that's sort of like the sharp tooth of a fish.,And once this display gets going, I'm not touching it anymore.,This is an unbelievable light show.,It's this pinwheel of light,,and I've done calculations that show that this could be seen,from as much as 300 feet away by a predator.,And I thought, "You know,,that might actually make a pretty good lure.",Because one of the things that's frustrated me,as a deep-sea explorer,is how many animals there probably are in the ocean that we know nothing about,because of the way we explore the ocean. 
 The primary way that we know about what lives in the ocean,is we go out and drag nets behind ships.,And I defy you to name any other branch of science,that still depends on hundreds of year-old technology.,The other primary way is we go down,with submersibles and remote-operated vehicles.,I've made hundreds of dives in submersibles.,When I'm sitting in a submersible though,,I know that I'm not unobtrusive at all --,I've got bright lights and noisy thrusters --,any animal with any sense is going to be long gone.,So, I've wanted for a long time,to figure out a different way to explore. 
 And so, sometime ago, I got this idea for a camera system.,It's not exactly rocket science. We call this thing Eye-in-the-Sea.,And scientists have done this on land for years;,we just use a color that the animals can't see,and then a camera that can see that color.,You can't use infrared in the sea.,We use far-red light, but even that's a problem,because it gets absorbed so quickly.,Made an intensified camera,,wanted to make this electronic jellyfish.,Thing is, in science,,you basically have to tell the funding agencies what you're going to discover,before they'll give you the money.,And I didn't know what I was going to discover,,so I couldn't get the funding for this.,So I kluged this together, I got the Harvey Mudd Engineering Clinic,to actually do it as an undergraduate student project initially,,and then I kluged funding from a whole bunch of different sources. 
 Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute,gave me time with their ROV,so that I could test it and we could figure out,,you know, for example, which colors of red light we had to use,so that we could see the animals, but they couldn't see us --,get the electronic jellyfish working.,And you can see just what a shoestring operation this really was,,because we cast these 16 blue LEDs in epoxy,and you can see in the epoxy mold that we used,,the word Ziploc is still visible.,Needless to say, when it's kluged together like this,,there were a lot of trials and tribulations getting this working.,But there came a moment when it all came together,,and everything worked.,And, remarkably, that moment got caught on film,by photographer Mark Richards,,who happened to be there at the precise moment,that we discovered that it all came together.,That's me on the left,,my graduate student at the time, Erika Raymond,,and Lee Fry, who was the engineer on the project.,And we have this photograph posted in our lab in a place of honor,with the caption: "Engineer satisfying two women at once." (Laughter),And we were very, very happy. 
 So now we had a system,that we could actually take to some place,that was kind of like an oasis on the bottom of the ocean,that might be patrolled by large predators.,And so, the place that we took it to,was this place called a Brine Pool,,which is in the northern part of the Gulf of Mexico.,It's a magical place.,And I know this footage isn't going to look like anything to you --,we had a crummy camera at the time --,but I was ecstatic.,We're at the edge of the Brine Pool,,there's a fish that's swimming towards the camera.,It's clearly undisturbed by us.,And I had my window into the deep sea.,I, for the first time, could see what animals were doing down there,when we weren't down there disturbing them in some way.,Four hours into the deployment,,we had programmed the electronic jellyfish,to come on for the first time.,Eighty-six seconds after,it went into its pinwheel display,,we recorded this:,This is a squid, over six feet long,,that is so new to science,,it cannot be placed in any known scientific family.,I could not have asked for a better proof of concept. 
 And based on this, I went back to the National Science Foundation,and said, "This is what we will discover.",And they gave me enough money to do it right,,which has involved developing the world's first deep-sea webcam --,which has been installed in,the Monterey Canyon for the past year --,and now, more recently,,a modular form of this system,,a much more mobile form,that's a lot easier to launch and recover,,that I hope can be used on Sylvia's "hope spots",to help explore,and protect these areas,,and, for me, learn more about,the bioluminescence in these "hope spots." 
 So one of these take-home messages here,is, there is still a lot to explore in the oceans.,And Sylvia has said,that we are destroying the oceans before we even know what's in them,,and she's right.,So if you ever, ever get an opportunity,to take a dive in a submersible,,say yes -- a thousand times, yes --,and please turn out the lights.,I promise, you'll love it. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm an ecologist,,mostly a coral reef ecologist.,I started out in Chesapeake Bay,and went diving in the winter,and became a tropical ecologist overnight.,And it was really a lot of fun,for about 10 years.,I mean, somebody pays you,to go around and travel,and look at some of the most,beautiful places on the planet.,And that was what I did. 
 And I ended up in Jamaica,,in the West Indies,,where the coral reefs were really,among the most extraordinary, structurally,,that I ever saw in my life.,And this picture here,,it's really interesting, it shows two things:,First of all, it's in black and white,because the water was so clear,and you could see so far,,and film was so slow,in the 1960s and early 70s,,you took pictures in black and white.,The other thing it shows you,is that, although there's this beautiful,forest of coral,,there are no fish in that picture. 
 Those reefs at Discovery Bay, Jamaica,were the most studied coral reefs,in the world for 20 years.,We were the best and the brightest.,People came to study our reefs from Australia,,which is sort of funny,because now we go to theirs.,And the view of scientists,about how coral reefs work, how they ought to be,,was based on these reefs,without any fish.,Then, in 1980,,there was a hurricane, Hurricane Allen.,I put half the lab,up in my house.,The wind blew very strong.,The waves were 25,to 50 feet high.,And the reefs disappeared, and new islands formed,,and we thought, "Well, we're real smart.,We know that hurricanes,have always happened in the past.",And we published a paper in Science,,the first time that anybody ever,described the destruction,on a coral reef by a major hurricane.,And we predicted what would happen,,and we got it all wrong.,And the reason was,because of overfishing,,and the fact that a last common grazer,,a sea urchin, died.,And within a few months,after that sea urchin dying, the seaweed started to grow.,And that is the same reef;,that's the same reef 15 years ago;,that's the same reef today.,The coral reefs of the north coast of Jamaica,have a few percent live coral cover,and a lot of seaweed and slime.,And that's more or less the story,of the coral reefs of the Caribbean,,and increasingly, tragically,,the coral reefs worldwide. 
 Now, that's my little, depressing story.,All of us in our 60s and 70s,have comparable depressing stories.,There are tens of thousands,of those stories out there,,and it's really hard to conjure up,much of a sense of well-being,,because it just keeps getting worse.,And the reason it keeps getting worse,is that after a natural catastrophe,,like a hurricane,,it used to be that there was,some kind of successional sequence of recovery,,but what's going on now is that,overfishing and pollution and climate change,are all interacting,in a way that prevents that.,And so I'm going to sort of go through,and talk about those three,kinds of things. 
 We hear a lot about,the collapse of cod.,It's difficult to imagine that,two, or some historians would say three world wars,were fought during the colonial era,for the control of cod.,Cod fed most of the people of Western Europe.,It fed the slaves,brought to the Antilles,,the song "Jamaica Farewell" --,"Ackee rice salt fish are nice" --,is an emblem of the importance,of salt cod from northeastern Canada.,It all collapsed in the 80s and the 90s:,35,000 people lost their jobs.,And that was the beginning,of a kind of serial depletion,from bigger and tastier species,to smaller and not-so-tasty species,,from species that were near to home,to species that were all around the world,,and what have you.,It's a little hard to understand that,,because you can go to a Costco in the United States,and buy cheap fish.,You ought to read the label to find out where it came from,,but it's still cheap,,and everybody thinks it's okay. 
 It's hard to communicate this,,and one way that I think is really interesting,is to talk about sport fish,,because people like to go out and catch fish.,It's one of those things.,This picture here shows the trophy fish,,the biggest fish caught,by people who pay a lot of money,to get on a boat,,go to a place off of Key West in Florida,,drink a lot of beer,,throw a lot of hooks and lines into the water,,come back with the biggest and the best fish,,and the champion trophy fish,are put on this board, where people take a picture,,and this guy is obviously,really excited about that fish.,Well, that's what it's like now,,but this is what it was like in the 1950s,from the same boat in the same place,on the same board on the same dock.,The trophy fish,were so big,that you couldn't put any of those small fish up on it.,And the average size trophy fish,weighed 250 to 300 pounds, goliath grouper,,and if you wanted to go out and kill something,,you could pretty much count on,being able to catch one of those fish.,And they tasted really good.,And people paid less in 1950 dollars,to catch that,than what people pay now,to catch those little, tiny fish.,And that's everywhere. 
 It's not just the fish, though,,that are disappearing.,Industrial fishing uses big stuff,,big machinery.,We use nets that are 20 miles long.,We use longlines,that have one million or two million hooks.,And we trawl,,which means to take something,the size of a tractor trailer truck,that weighs thousands and thousands of pounds,,put it on a big chain,,and drag it across the sea floor,to stir up the bottom and catch the fish.,Think of it as,being kind of the bulldozing of a city,or of a forest,,because it clears it away.,And the habitat destruction,is unbelievable.,This is a photograph,,a typical photograph,,of what the continental shelves,of the world look like.,You can see the rows in the bottom,,the way you can see the rows,in a field that has just been plowed,to plant corn.,What that was, was a forest of sponges and coral,,which is a critical habitat,for the development of fish.,What it is now is mud,,and the area of the ocean floor,that has been transformed from forest,to level mud, to parking lot,,is equivalent to the entire area,of all the forests,that have ever been cut down,on all of the earth,in the history of humanity.,We've managed to do that,in the last 100 to 150 years. 
 We tend to think of oil spills,and mercury,and we hear a lot about plastic these days.,And all of that stuff is really disgusting,,but what's really insidious,is the biological pollution that happens,because of the magnitude of the shifts,that it causes,to entire ecosystems.,And I'm going to just talk very briefly,about two kinds of biological pollution:,one is introduced species,and the other is what comes from nutrients.,So this is the infamous,Caulerpa taxifolia,,the so-called killer algae.,A book was written about it.,It's a bit of an embarrassment.,It was accidentally released,from the aquarium in Monaco,,it was bred to be cold tolerant,to have in peoples aquaria.,It's very pretty,,and it has rapidly started,to overgrow,the once very rich,biodiversity of the,northwestern Mediterranean.,I don't know how many of you remember the movie,"The Little Shop of Horrors,",but this is the plant of "The Little Shop of Horrors.",But, instead of devouring the people in the shop,,what it's doing is overgrowing,and smothering,virtually all of the bottom-dwelling life,of the entire northwestern,Mediterranean Sea.,We don't know anything that eats it,,we're trying to do all sorts of genetics,and figure out something that could be done,,but, as it stands, it's the monster from hell,,about which nobody knows what to do. 
 Now another form of pollution,that's biological pollution,is what happens from excess nutrients.,The green revolution,,all of this artificial nitrogen fertilizer, we use too much of it.,It's subsidized, which is one of the reasons we used too much of it.,It runs down the rivers,,and it feeds the plankton,,the little microscopic plant cells,in the coastal water.,But since we ate all the oysters,and we ate all the fish that would eat the plankton,,there's nothing to eat the plankton,and there's more and more of it,,so it dies of old age,,which is unheard of for plankton.,And when it dies, it falls to the bottom,and then it rots,,which means that bacteria break it down.,And in the process,they use up all the oxygen,,and in using up all the oxygen,they make the environment utterly lethal,for anything that can't swim away.,So, what we end up with,is a microbial zoo,dominated by bacteria,and jellyfish, as you see,on the left in front of you.,And the only fishery left --,and it is a commercial fishery --,is the jellyfish fishery,you see on the right, where there used to be prawns.,Even in Newfoundland,where we used to catch cod,,we now have a jellyfish fishery. 
 And another version of this sort of thing,is what is often called red tides,or toxic blooms.,That picture on the left is just staggering to me.,I have talked about it a million times,,but it's unbelievable.,In the upper right of that picture on the left,is almost the Mississippi Delta,,and the lower left of that picture,is the Texas-Mexico border.,You're looking at the entire,northwestern Gulf of Mexico;,you're looking at one toxic,dinoflagellate bloom that can kill fish,,made by that beautiful little creature,on the lower right.,And in the upper right you see this,black sort of cloud,moving ashore.,That's the same species.,And as it comes to shore and the wind blows,,and little droplets of the water get into the air,,the emergency rooms of all the hospitals fill up,with people with acute respiratory distress.,And that's retirement homes,on the west coast of Florida.,A friend and I did this thing in Hollywood,we called Hollywood ocean night,,and I was trying to figure out how to,explain to actors what's going on.,And I said,,"So, imagine you're in a movie called 'Escape from Malibu',because all the beautiful people have moved,to North Dakota, where it's clean and safe.,And the only people who are left there,are the people who can't afford,to move away from the coast,,because the coast, instead of being paradise,,is harmful to your health." 
 And then this is amazing.,It was when I was on holiday last early autumn in France.,This is from the coast of Brittany,,which is being enveloped,in this green, algal slime.,The reason that it attracted so much attention,,besides the fact that it's disgusting,,is that sea birds flying over it,are asphyxiated by the smell and die,,and a farmer died of it,,and you can imagine the scandal that happened.,And so there's this war,between the farmers,and the fishermen about it all,,and the net result is that,the beaches of Brittany have to be bulldozed of this stuff,on a regular basis. 
 And then, of course, there's climate change,,and we all know about climate change.,I guess the iconic figure of it,is the melting of the ice,in the Arctic Sea.,Think about the thousands and thousands of people who died,trying to find the Northwest Passage.,Well, the Northwest Passage is already there.,I think it's sort of funny;,it's on the Siberian coast,,maybe the Russians will charge tolls.,The governments of the world,are taking this really seriously.,The military of the Arctic nations,is taking it really seriously.,For all the denial of climate change,by government leaders,,the CIA,and the navies of Norway,and the U.S. and Canada, whatever,are busily thinking about,how they will secure their territory,in this inevitability,from their point of view.,And, of course, Arctic communities are toast. 
 The other kinds of effects of climate change --,this is coral bleaching. It's a beautiful picture, right?,All that white coral.,Except it's supposed to be brown.,What happens is that,the corals are a symbiosis,,and they have these little algal cells,that live inside them.,And the algae give the corals sugar,,and the corals give the algae,nutrients and protection.,But when it gets too hot,,the algae can't make the sugar.,The corals say, "You cheated. You didn't pay your rent.",They kick them out, and then they die.,Not all of them die; some of them survive,,some more are surviving,,but it's really bad news.,To try and give you a sense of this,,imagine you go camping in July,somewhere in Europe or in North America,,and you wake up the next morning, and you look around you,,and you see that 80 percent of the trees,,as far as you can see,,have dropped their leaves and are standing there naked.,And you come home, and you discover,that 80 percent of all the trees,in North America and in Europe,have dropped their leaves.,And then you read in the paper a few weeks later,,"Oh, by the way, a quarter of those died.",Well, that's what happened in the Indian Ocean,during the 1998 El Nino,,an area vastly greater,than the size of North America and Europe,,when 80 percent of all the corals bleached,and a quarter of them died. 
 And then the really scary thing,about all of this --,the overfishing, the pollution and the climate change --,is that each thing doesn't happen in a vacuum.,But there are these, what we call, positive feedbacks,,the synergies among them,that make the whole vastly greater,than the sum of the parts.,And the great scientific challenge,for people like me in thinking about all this,,is do we know how,to put Humpty Dumpty back together again?,I mean, because we, at this point, we can protect it.,But what does that mean?,We really don't know. 
 So what are the oceans going to be like,in 20 or 50 years?,Well, there won't be any fish,except for minnows,,and the water will be pretty dirty,,and all those kinds of things,and full of mercury, etc., etc.,And dead zones will get bigger and bigger,and they'll start to merge,,and we can imagine something like,the dead-zonification,of the global, coastal ocean.,Then you sure won't want to eat fish that were raised in it,,because it would be a kind of,gastronomic Russian roulette.,Sometimes you have a toxic bloom;,sometimes you don't.,That doesn't sell. 
 The really scary things though,are the physical, chemical,,oceanographic things that are happening.,As the surface of the ocean gets warmer,,the water is lighter when it's warmer,,it becomes harder and harder,to turn the ocean over.,We say it becomes,more strongly stratified.,The consequence of that is that,all those nutrients,that fuel the great anchoveta fisheries,,of the sardines of California,or in Peru or whatever,,those slow down,and those fisheries collapse.,And, at the same time,,water from the surface, which is rich in oxygen,,doesn't make it down,and the ocean turns into a desert. 
 So the question is: How are we all,going to respond to this?,And we can do,all sorts of things to fix it,,but in the final analysis,,the thing we really need to fix,is ourselves.,It's not about the fish; it's not about the pollution;,it's not about the climate change.,It's about us,and our greed and our need for growth,and our inability to imagine a world,that is different from the selfish world,we live in today.,So the question is: Will we respond to this or not?,I would say that the future of life,and the dignity of human beings,depends on our doing that. 
 Thank you. (Applause)I'm going to speak,about a tiny, little idea.,And this is about shifting baseline.,And because the idea can be explained in one minute,,I will tell you three stories before,to fill in the time.,And the first story,is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.,And he was here, as you well know, in '35.,And you'd think he was chasing finches,,but he wasn't.,He was actually collecting fish.,And he described one of them,as very "common.",This was the sailfin grouper.,A big fishery was run on it,until the '80s.,Now the fish is on the IUCN Red List.,Now this story,,we have heard it lots of times,on Galapagos and other places,,so there is nothing particular about it.,But the point is, we still come to Galapagos.,We still think it is pristine.,The brochures still say,it is untouched.,So what happens here? 
 The second story, also to illustrate another concept,,is called shifting waistline.,(Laughter),Because I was there in '71,,studying a lagoon in West Africa.,I was there because I grew up in Europe,and I wanted later to work in Africa.,And I thought I could blend in.,And I got a big sunburn,,and I was convinced that I was really not from there.,This was my first sunburn. 
 And the lagoon,was surrounded by palm trees,,as you can see, and a few mangrove.,And it had tilapia,about 20 centimeters,,a species of tilapia called blackchin tilapia.,And the fisheries for this tilapia,sustained lots of fish and they had a good time,and they earned more than average,in Ghana.,When I went there 27 years later,,the fish had shrunk to half of their size.,They were maturing at five centimeters.,They had been pushed genetically.,There were still fishes.,They were still kind of happy.,And the fish also were happy to be there.,So nothing has changed,,but everything has changed. 
 My third little story,is that I was an accomplice,in the introduction of trawling,in Southeast Asia.,In the '70s -- well, beginning in the '60s --,Europe did lots of development projects.,Fish development,meant imposing on countries,that had already 100,000 fishers,to impose on them industrial fishing.,And this boat, quite ugly,,is called the Mutiara 4.,And I went sailing on it,,and we did surveys,throughout the southern South China sea,and especially the Java Sea.,And what we caught,,we didn't have words for it.,What we caught, I know now,,is the bottom of the sea.,And 90 percent of our catch,were sponges,,other animals that are fixed on the bottom.,And actually most of the fish,,they are a little spot on the debris,,the piles of debris, were coral reef fish.,Essentially the bottom of the sea came onto the deck,and then was thrown down. 
 And these pictures are extraordinary,because this transition is very rapid.,Within a year, you do a survey,and then commercial fishing begins.,The bottom is transformed,from, in this case, a hard bottom or soft coral,into a muddy mess.,This is a dead turtle.,They were not eaten, they were thrown away because they were dead.,And one time we caught a live one.,It was not drowned yet.,And then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat.,This mountain of debris,is actually collected by fishers,every time they go,into an area that's never been fished.,But it's not documented. 
 We transform the world,,but we don't remember it.,We adjust our baseline,to the new level,,and we don't recall what was there.,If you generalize this,,something like this happens.,You have on the y axis some good thing:,biodiversity, numbers of orca,,the greenness of your country, the water supply.,And over time it changes --,it changes,because people do things, or naturally.,Every generation,will use the images,that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives,as a standard,and will extrapolate forward.,And the difference then,,they perceive as a loss.,But they don't perceive what happened before as a loss.,You can have a succession of changes.,At the end you want to sustain,miserable leftovers.,And that, to a large extent, is what we want to do now.,We want to sustain things that are gone,or things that are not the way they were. 
 Now one should think,this problem affected people,certainly when in predatory societies,,they killed animals,and they didn't know they had done so,after a few generations.,Because, obviously,,an animal that is very abundant,,before it gets extinct,,it becomes rare.,So you don't lose abundant animals.,You always lose rare animals.,And therefore they're not perceived,as a big loss.,Over time,,we concentrate on large animals,,and in a sea that means the big fish.,They become rarer because we fish them.,Over time we have a few fish left,and we think this is the baseline. 
 And the question is,,why do people accept this?,Well because they don't know that it was different.,And in fact, lots of people, scientists,,will contest that it was really different.,And they will contest this,because the evidence,presented in an earlier mode,is not in the way,they would like the evidence presented.,For example,,the anecdote that some present,,as Captain so-and-so,observed lots of fish in this area,cannot be used,or is usually not utilized by fishery scientists,,because it's not "scientific.",So you have a situation,where people don't know the past,,even though we live in literate societies,,because they don't trust,the sources of the past. 
 And hence, the enormous role,that a marine protected area can play.,Because with marine protected areas,,we actually recreate the past.,We recreate the past that people cannot conceive,because the baseline has shifted,and is extremely low.,That is for people,who can see a marine protected area,and who can benefit,from the insight that it provides,,which enables them to reset their baseline. 
 How about the people who can't do that,because they have no access --,the people in the Midwest for example?,There I think,that the arts and film,can perhaps fill the gap,,and simulation.,This is a simulation of Chesapeake Bay.,There were gray whales in Chesapeake Bay a long time ago --,500 years ago.,And you will have noticed that the hues and tones,are like "Avatar.",(Laughter),And if you think about "Avatar,",if you think of why people were so touched by it --,never mind the Pocahontas story --,why so touched by the imagery?,Because it evokes something,that in a sense has been lost.,And so my recommendation,,it's the only one I will provide,,is for Cameron to do "Avatar II" underwater. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I want to talk about penguins today.,But first, I want to start by saying that,we need a new operating system,,for the oceans and for the Earth.,When I came to the Galapagos 40 years ago,,there were 3,000 people,that lived in the Galapagos.,Now there are over 30,000.,There were two Jeeps on Santa Cruz.,Now, there are around a thousand trucks,and buses and cars there.,So the fundamental problems that we face,are overconsumption and too many people.,It's the same problems in the Galapagos,,except, obviously,,it's worse here, in some ways, than other places.,Because we've only doubled the population of the Earth,since the 1960s -- a little more than doubled --,but we have 6.7 billion people in the world,,and we all like to consume.,And one of the major problems that we have,is our operating system,is not giving us the proper feedback.,We're not paying the true,environmental costs of our actions. 
 And when I came at age 22 to live on Fernandina,,let me just say, that I had never,camped before.,I had never lived alone,for any period of time,,and I'd never slept with sea lions,snoring next to me all night.,But moreover, I'd never lived on an uninhabited island.,Punta Espinosa is where I lived for over a year,,and we call it uninhabited,because there are no people there.,But it's alive with life;,it's hardly uninhabited.,So a lot has happened in the last 40 years, 
 and what I learned when I came to the Galapagos,is the importance of wild places, wild things,,certainly wildlife,,and the amazing qualities that penguins have.,Penguins are real athletes:,They can swim 173 kilometers in a day.,They can swim at the same speed day and night --,that's faster than any Olympic swimmer.,I mean, they can do like seven kilometers an hour,and sustain it.,But what is really amazing, because of this deepness here,,Emperor penguins can go down,more than 500 meters,and they can hold their breath for 23 minutes.,Magellanic penguins, the ones that I work on,,they can dive to about 90 meters,and they can stay down for,about 4.6 minutes.,Humans, without fins: 90 meters, 3.5 minutes.,And I doubt anybody in this room,could really hold their breath for 3.5 minutes.,You have to train to be able to do that.,So penguins are amazing athletes. 
 The other thing is, I've never met anybody,that really doesn't say that they like penguins.,They're comical, they walk upright,,and, of course, they're diligent.,And, more importantly, they're well-dressed.,So they have all the criteria,that people normally like.,But scientifically, they're amazing because they're sentinels.,They tell us about our world in a lot of different ways,,and particularly the ocean. 
 This is a picture of a Galapagos penguin,that's on the front of a little zodiac here in the Galapagos.,And that's what I came to study.,I thought I was going to study the social behavior of Galapagos penguins,,but you already know,penguins are rare.,These are the rarest penguins in the world.,Why I thought I was going to be able to do that, I don't know.,But the population has changed,dramatically since I was first here.,When I counted penguins for the first time,and tried to do a census,,we just counted all the individual beaks that we could,around all these islands.,We counted around 2,000, so I don't know how many penguins there really are,,but I know I can count 2,000.,If you go and do it now, the national parks,count about 500.,So we have a quarter of the penguins,that we did 40 years ago.,And this is true of most of our living systems.,We have less than we had before,,and most of them are in fairly steep decline.,And I want to just show you a little bit about why. 
 (Braying) 
 That's a penguin braying,to tell you that,it's important to pay attention to penguins.,Most important of all,,I didn't know what that was the first time I heard it.,And you can imagine sleeping on Fernandina your first night there,and you hear this lonesome, plaintful call.,I fell in love with penguins,,and it certainly has changed the rest of my life.,What I found out I was studying,is really the difference in how the Galapagos changes,,the most extreme variation.,You've heard about these El Ninos,,but this is the extreme that penguins all over the world,have to adapt to.,This is a cold-water event,called La Nina.,Where it's blue and it's green, it means the water is really cold.,And so you can see this current coming up --,in this case, the Humboldt Current --,that comes all the way out to the Galapagos Islands,,and this deep undersea current, the Cromwell Current,,that upwells around the Galapagos.,That brings all the nutrients:,When this is cold in the Galapagos,,it's rich, and there's plenty of food for everyone. 
 When we have extreme El Nino events,,you see all this red,,and you see no green,out here around the Galapagos.,That means that there's no upwelling,,and there's basically no food.,So it's a real desert,for not only for the penguins and the sea lions and the marine iguanas ...,things die when there's no food.,But we didn't even know that that,affected the Galapagos when I went to study penguins.,And you can imagine being on an island hoping you're going to see penguins,,and you're in the middle of an El Nino event,and there are no penguins.,They're not breeding; they're not even around.,I studied marine iguanas at that point.,But this is a global phenomenon, we know that. 
 And if you look along the coast of Argentina, where I work now,,at a place called Punta Tombo --,the largest Magellanic penguin colony in the world,down here about 44 degrees south latitude --,you see that there's great variation here.,Some years, the cold water,goes all the way up to Brazil,,and other years, in these La Nina years, it doesn't.,So the oceans don't always act together; they act differently,,but that is the kind of variation,that penguins have to live with,,and it's not easy.,So when I went to study the Magellanic penguins,,I didn't have any problems.,There were plenty of them. 
 This is a picture at Punta Tombo in February,showing all the penguins along the beach.,I went there because the Japanese wanted to start harvesting them,and turning them into high fashion golf gloves,,protein and oil.,Fortunately, nobody has harvested any penguins,and we're getting over 100,000 tourists a year to see them.,But the population is declining,and it's declined fairly substantially, about 21 percent,since 1987, when I started these surveys,,in terms of number of active nests.,Here, you can see where Punta Tombo is,,and they breed in incredibly dense colonies.,We know this because of long-term science,,because we have long-term studies there.,And science is important in informing decision makers,,and also in changing how we do,and knowing the direction of change that we're going in. 
 And so we have this penguin project. The Wildlife Conservation Society,has funded me along with a lot of individuals,over the last 27 years,to be able to produce these kinds of maps.,And also, we know that it's not only,Galapagos penguins that are in trouble,,but Magellanics and many other species of penguins.,And so we have started a global penguin society,to try to focus on the real plight of penguins.,This is one of the plights of penguins: oil pollution.,Penguins don't like oil,and they don't like to swim through oil.,The nice thing is, if you look down here in Argentina,,there's no surface oil pollution from this composite map.,But, in fact, when we went to Argentina,,penguins were often found,totally covered in oil.,So they were just minding their own business.,They ended up swimming through ballast water that had oil in it.,Because when tankers carry oil,they have to have ballast at some point,,so when they're empty, they have the ballast water in there.,When they come back, they actually dump,this oily ballast water into the ocean.,Why do they do that? Because it's cheaper,,because they don't pay the real environmental costs.,We usually don't, and we want to start,getting the accounting system right,so we can pay the real cost. 
 At first, the Argentine government said, "No, there's no way.,You can't find oiled penguins in Argentina.,We have laws,,and we can't have illegal dumping; it's against the law.",So we ended up spending nine years,convincing the government that there were lots of oiled penguins.,In some years, like this year, we found,more than 80 percent,of the adult penguins dead on the beach,were covered in oil.,These little blue dots are the fledglings --,we do this survey every March --,which means that they're only in the environment,from January until March,,so maybe three months at the most,that they could get covered in oil.,And you can see, in some years over 60 percent,of the fledglings were oiled. 
 Eventually, the government listened,and, amazingly, they changed their laws.,They moved the tanker lanes,40 kilometers farther off shore,,and people are not doing as much illegal dumping.,So what we're seeing now,is very few penguins are oiled.,Why are there even these penguins oiled?,Because we've solved the problem in Chubut province,,which is like a state in Argentina,where Punta Tombo is --,so that's about 1,000 kilometers of coastline --,but we haven't solved the problem,in northern Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil.,So now I want to show you that penguins are affected. 
 I'm just going to talk about two things.,This is climate change. Now this has really been a fun study,because I put satellite tags on the back,of these Magellanic penguins.,Try to convince donors to give you a couple thousand dollars,to glue a satellite tag on the back of penguins.,But we've been doing this now for more than a decade to learn where they go.,We thought we needed a marine protected area,of about 30 kilometers,,and then we put a satellite tag on the back of a penguin.,And what the penguins show us --,and these are all the little dots,from where the penguins' positions were,for penguins in incubation in 2003 --,and what you see is some of these individuals,are going 800 kilometers away from their nests.,So that means as their mate,is sitting on the nest incubating the eggs,,the other one is out there foraging,,and the longer they have to stay gone,,the worse condition the mate is in when the mate comes back.,And, of course, all of this then leads to a vicious cycle,and you can't raise a lot of chicks. 
 Here you see in 2003 --,these are all the dots of where the penguins are --,they were raising a little over,a half of a chick.,Here, you can see in 2006,,they raised almost three quarters,of a chick per nest,,and you can see that they're closer to Punta Tombo;,they're not going as far away.,This past year, in 2009,,you can see that they're now raising,about a fourth of a chick,,and some of these individuals are going,more than 900 kilometers away from their nests.,So it's kind of like you having a job in Chicago,,and then you get transferred,to St. Louis,,and your mate is not happy about this,because you've got to pay airfare,,because you're gone longer.,The same thing's true for penguins as well.,And they're going about, on average now,,40 kilometers farther than they did a decade ago. 
 We need to be able to get information out to the general public.,And so we started a publication,with the Society for Conservation,that we think presents cutting-edge science,in a new, novel way,,because we have reporters that are good writers,that actually can distill the information,and make it accessible to the general public.,So if you're interested in cutting-edge science,and smarter conservation,,you should join with our 11 partners --,some of them here in this room, like the Nature Conservancy --,and look at this magazine,because we need to get information out about conservation,to the general public. 
 Lastly I want to say that,all of you, probably,,have had some relationship at some time in your life,with a dog, a cat, some sort of pet,,and you recognized that those are individuals.,And some of you consider them almost part of your family.,If you had a relationship with a penguin,,you'd see it in the same sort of way.,They're amazing creatures,that really change how you view the world,because they're not that different from us:,They're trying to make a living,,they're trying to raise their offspring,,they're trying to get on and survive in the world. 
 This is Turbo the Penguin.,Turbo's never been fed.,He met us and got his name,because he started standing under,my diesel truck: a turbo truck,,so we named him Turbo.,Turbo has taken to knocking on the door with his beak,,we let him in and he comes in here.,And I just wanted to show you,what happened one day,when Turbo brought in a friend.,So this is Turbo.,He's coming up to one of my graduate students and flipper patting,,which he would do to a female penguin.,And you can see, he's not trying to bite.,This guy has never been in before,and he's trying to figure out, "What is going on?,What is this guy doing?,This is really pretty weird.",And you'll see soon,that my graduate student ...,and you see, Turbo's pretty intent,on his flipper patting.,And now he's looking at the other guy,,saying, "You are really weird.",And now look at this: not friendly.,So penguins really differ in their personalities,just like our dogs and our cats. 
 We're also trying to collect our information,and become more technologically literate.,So we're trying to put that,in computers in the field.,And penguins are always involved in helping us,or not helping us in one way or another.,This is a radio frequency ID system.,You put a little piece of rice in the foot of a penguin,that has a barcode, so it tells you who it is.,It walks over the pad, and you know who it is. 
 Okay, so here are a few penguins coming in.,See, this one's coming back to its nest.,They're all coming in at this time,,walking across there, just kind of leisurely coming in.,Here's a female that's in a hurry. She's got food.,She's really rushing back, because it's hot,,to try to feed her chicks.,And then there's another fellow that will leisurely come by.,Look how fat he is. He's walking back to feed his chicks.,Then I realize that they're playing,king of the box.,This is my box up here, and this is the system that works.,You can see this penguin, he goes over, he looks at those wires,,does not like that wire.,He unplugs the wire; we have no data. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, they really are pretty amazing creatures.,OK.,Most important thing is:,Only you can change yourself,,and only you can change the world,and make it better, for people,as well as penguins. 
 So, thank you very much. (Applause)I'm going to tell you two things today:,One is what we have lost,,and two, a way to bring it back.,And let me start with this.,This is my baseline:,This is the Mediterranean coast,with no fish, bare rock,and lots of sea urchins that like to eat the algae.,Something like this is what I first saw,when I jumped in the water for the first time,in the Mediterranean coast off Spain.,Now, if an alien came to earth --,let's call him Joe --,what would Joe see?,If Joe jumped in a coral reef,,there are many things the alien could see.,Very unlikely, Joe would jump,on a pristine coral reef,,a virgin coral reef with lots of coral, sharks, crocodiles,,manatees, groupers,,turtles, etc.,So, probably, what Joe would see,would be in this part, in the greenish part of the picture.,Here we have the extreme with dead corals,,microbial soup and jellyfish.,And where the diver is,,this is probably where most of the reefs of the world are now,,with very few corals, algae overgrowing the corals,,lots of bacteria,,and where the large animals are gone.,And this is what most marine scientists have seen too.,This is their baseline. This is what they think is natural,because we started modern science,with scuba diving long after,we started degrading marine ecosystems. 
 So I'm going to get us all on a time machine,,and we're going to the left; we're going to go back to the past,to see what the ocean was like.,And let's start with this time machine, the Line Islands,,where we have conducted a series,of National Geographic expeditions.,This sea is an archipelago belonging to Kiribati,that spans across the equator,and it has several uninhabited,,unfished, pristine islands,and a few inhabited islands.,So let's start with the first one: Christmas Island, over 5,000 people.,Most of the reefs are dead,,most of the corals are dead -- overgrown by algae --,and most of the fish are smaller than,the pencils we use to count them.,We did 250 hours of diving here,in 2005.,We didn't see a single shark.,This is the place that Captain Cook discovered in 1777,and he described a huge abundance of sharks,biting the rudders and the oars of their small boats,while they were going ashore. 
 Let's move the dial a little bit to the past.,Fanning Island, 2,500 people.,The corals are doing better here. Lots of small fish.,This is what many divers would consider paradise.,This is where you can see most,of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.,And many people think this is really, really beautiful,,if this is your baseline.,If we go back to a place,like Palmyra Atoll,,where I was with Jeremy Jackson a few years ago,,the corals are doing better and there are sharks.,You can see sharks in every single dive.,And this is something that is very unusual in today's coral reefs.,But then, if we shift the dial,200, 500 years back,,then we get to the places where the corals,are absolutely healthy and gorgeous,,forming spectacular structures,,and where the predators,are the most conspicuous thing,,where you see between 25 and 50 sharks per dive. 
 What have we learned from these places?,This is what we thought was natural.,This is what we call the biomass pyramid.,If we get all of the fish of a coral reef together and weigh them,,this is what we would expect.,Most of the biomass is low on the food chain, the herbivores,,the parrotfish, the surgeonfish that eat the algae.,Then the plankton feeders, these little damselfish,,the little animals floating in the water.,And then we have a lower biomass of carnivores,,and a lower biomass of top head,,or the sharks, the large snappers, the large groupers.,But this is a consequence.,This view of the world is a consequence,of having studied degraded reefs. 
 When we went to pristine reefs,,we realized that the natural world,was upside down;,this pyramid was inverted.,The top head does account for most of the biomass,,in some places up to 85 percent,,like Kingman Reef, which is now protected.,The good news is that, in addition to having more predators,,there's more of everything.,The size of these boxes is bigger.,We have more sharks, more biomass of snappers,,more biomass of herbivores, too,,like these parrot fish that are like marine goats.,They clean the reef; everything that grows enough to be seen,,they eat, and they keep the reef clean,and allow the corals to replenish.,Not only do these places --,these ancient, pristine places -- have lots of fish,,but they also have other important components,of the ecosystem like the giant clams;,pavements of giant clams in the lagoons,,up to 20, 25 per square meter.,These have disappeared from every inhabited reef in the world,,and they filter the water;,they keep the water clean from,microbes and pathogens. 
 But still, now we have global warming.,If we don't have fishing because these reefs are protected by law,or their remoteness, this is great.,But the water gets warmer for too long,and the corals die.,So how are these fish,,these predators going to help?,Well, what we have seen is that,in this particular area,during El Nino, year '97, '98,,the water was too warm for too long,,and many corals bleached,and many died.,In Christmas, where the food web is really trimmed down,,where the large animals are gone,,the corals have not recovered.,In Fanning Island, the corals are not recovered.,But you see here,a big table coral that died and collapsed.,And the fish have grazed the algae,,so the turf of algae is a little lower.,Then you go to Palmyra Atoll,that has more biomass of herbivores,,and the dead corals are clean,,and the corals are coming back.,And when you go to the pristine side,,did this ever bleach?,These places bleached too, but they recovered faster.,The more intact, the more complete,,[and] the more complex your food web,,the higher the resilience, [and] the more likely,that the system is going to recover,from the short-term impacts of warming events.,And that's good news, so we need to recover that structure.,We need to make sure that all of the pieces of the ecosystem are there,so the ecosystem can adapt,to the effects of global warming. 
 So if we have to reset the baseline,,if we have to push the ecosystem back to the left,,how can we do it?,Well, there are several ways.,One very clear way is the marine protected areas,,especially no-take reserves,that we set aside,to allow for the recovery for marine life.,And let me go back to that image,of the Mediterranean.,This was my baseline. This is what I saw when I was a kid.,And at the same time I was watching,Jacques Cousteau's shows on TV,,with all this richness and abundance and diversity.,And I thought that this richness,belonged to tropical seas,,and that the Mediterranean was a naturally poor sea.,But, little did I know,,until I jumped for the first time in a marine reserve.,And this is what I saw, lots of fish. 
 After a few years, between five and seven years,,fish come back, they eat the urchins,,and then the algae grow again.,So you have this little algal forest,,and in the size of a laptop,you can find more than 100 species of algae,,mostly microscopic fit,hundreds of species of little animals,that then feed the fish,,so that the system recovers.,And this particular place, the Medes Islands Marine Reserve,,is only 94 hectares,,and it brings 6 million euros to the local economy,,20 times more than fishing,,and it represents 88 percent,of all the tourist revenue.,So these places not only help the ecosystem,but also help the people,who can benefit from the ecosystem. 
 So let me just give you a summary,of what no-take reserves do.,These places, when we protect them,,if we compare them to unprotected areas nearby, this is what happens.,The number of species increases 21 percent;,so if you have 1,000 species,you would expect 200 more in a marine reserve.,This is very substantial.,The size of organisms increases a third,,so your fish are now this big.,The abundance, how many fish you have per square meter,,increases almost 170 percent.,And the biomass -- this is the most spectacular change --,4.5 times greater biomass,on average, just after five to seven years.,In some places up to 10 times,larger biomass inside the reserves. 
 So we have all these things,inside the reserve that grow, and what do they do?,They reproduce. That's population biology 101.,If you don't kill the fish, they take a longer time to die,,they grow larger and they reproduce a lot.,And same thing for invertebrates. This is the example.,These are egg cases,laid by a snail off the coast of Chile,,and this is how many eggs they lay on the bottom.,Outside the reserve,,you cannot even detect this.,One point three million eggs per square meter,inside the marine reserve where these snails are very abundant.,So these organisms reproduce,,the little larvae juveniles spill over,,they all spill over,,and then people can benefit from them outside too.,This is in the Bahamas: Nassau grouper.,Huge abundance of groupers inside the reserve,,and the closer you get to the reserve,,the more fish you have.,So the fishermen are catching more.,You can see where the limits of the reserve are,because you see the boats lined up.,So there is spill over;,there are benefits beyond the boundaries of these reserves,that help people around them,,while at the same time,the reserve is protecting,the entire habitat. It is building resilience. 
 So what we have now --,or a world without reserves --,is like a debit account,where we withdraw all the time,and we never make any deposit.,Reserves are like savings accounts.,We have this principal that we don't touch;,that produces returns,,social, economic and ecological.,And if we think about the increase of biomass inside the reserves,,this is like compound interest.,Two examples, again,,of how these reserves can benefit people.,This is how much fishermen get,everyday in Kenya, fishing,over a series of years,,in a place where,there is no protection; it's a free-for-all.,Once the most degrading fishing gear,,seine nets, were removed,,the fishermen were catching more.,If you fish less, you're actually catching more.,But if we add the no-take reserve on top of that,,the fishermen are still making more money,by fishing less around an area that is protected. 
 Another example:,Nassau groupers in Belize in the Mesoamerican Reef.,This is grouper sex,,and the groupers aggregate around the full moons,of December and January for a week.,They used to aggregate up to the,tens of thousands, 30,000 groupers about this big,in one hectare, in one aggregation.,Fishermen knew about these things; they caught them, and they depleted them.,When I went there for the first time in 2000,,there were only 3,000 groupers left.,And the fishermen were authorized to catch 30 percent,of the entire spawning population every year.,So we did a simple analysis,,and it doesn't take rocket science,to figure out that, if you take 30 percent every year,,your fishery is going to collapse very quickly.,And with the fishery, the entire reproductive ability,of the species goes extinct.,It happened in many places around the Caribbean.,And they would make 4,000 dollars per year,,total, for the entire fishery,,several fishing boats.,Now, if you do an economic analysis,and project what would happen,if the fish were not cut,,if we brought just 20 divers,one month per year,,the revenue would be more than 20 times higher,and that would be sustainable over time. 
 So how much of this do we have?,If this is so good, if this is such a no-brainer, how much of this do we have?,And you already heard that,less than one percent of the ocean's protected.,We're getting closer to one percent now,,thanks to the protections of the Chagos Archipelago,,and only a fraction of this is fully protected from fishing.,Scientific studies recommend that at least 20 percent,of the ocean should be protected.,The estimated range is between 20 and 50 percent,for a series of goals of biodiversity,and fishery enhancement and resilience. 
 Now, is this possible? People would ask: How much would that cost?,Well, let's think about,how much we are paying now,to subsidize fishing:,35 billion dollars per year.,Many of these subsidies go to destructive fishing practices.,Well, there are a couple estimates,of how much it would cost to create,a network of protected areas,covering 20 percent of the ocean,that would be only a fraction,of what we are now paying;,the government hands out to a fishery,that is collapsing.,People are losing their jobs because the fisheries are collapsing.,A creation of a network of reserves,would provide direct employment for more than a million people,plus all the secondary jobs and all the secondary benefits. 
 So how can we do that?,If it's so clear that these savings accounts,are good for the environment and for people,,why don't we have 20, 50 percent of the ocean?,And how can we reach that goal?,Well, there are two ways of getting there.,The trivial solution is to create really large protected areas,like the Chagos Archipelago.,The problem is that we can create these large reserves,only in places where there are no people, where there is no social conflict,,where the political cost is really low,and the economic cost is also low.,And a few of us, a few organizations in this room and elsewhere,are working on this. 
 But what about the rest of the coast of the world,,where people live and make a living out of fishing?,Well, there are three main reasons why,we don't have tens of thousands of small reserves:,The first one is that people have no idea,what marine reserves do,,and fishermen tend to be really, really defensive,when it comes to regulating or closing,an area, even if it's small.,Second, the governance is not right,because most coastal communities around the world,don't have the authority,to monitor the resources to create the reserve and enforce it.,It's a top down hierarchical structure,where people wait for,government agents to come,and this is not effective. And the government doesn't have enough resources. 
 Which takes us to the third reason,,why we don't have many more reserves,,is that the funding models have been wrong.,NGOs and governments,spend a lot of time and energy and resources,in a few small areas, usually.,So marine conservation and coastal protection,has become a sink for government or philanthropic money,,and this is not sustainable.,So the solutions are just,fixing these three issues.,First, we need to develop a global awareness campaign,to inspire local communities and governments,to create no-take reserves,that are better than what we have now.,It's the savings accounts,versus the debit accounts with no deposits.,Second, we need to redesign our governance,so conservation efforts can be decentralized,,so conservation efforts don't depend on,work from NGOs,or from government agencies,and can be created by the local communities,,like it happens in the Philippines and a few other places.,And third, and very important,,we need to develop new business models.,The philanthropy sink as the only way to create reserves,is not sustainable.,We really need to develop models, business models,,where coastal conservation,is an investment,,because we already know,that these marine reserves provide,social, ecological and economic benefits. 
 And I'd like to finish with one thought,,which is that no one,organization alone,is going to save the ocean.,There has been a lot of competition in the past,,and we need to develop,a new model of partnership,,truly collaborative,,where we are looking for complementing,,not substituting.,The stakes are just too high,to continue the way we are going.,So let's do that. Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: Thank you Enric. 
 Enric Sala: Thank you. 
 CA: That was a masterful job,of pulling things together.,First of all, your pyramid, your inverted pyramid,,showing 85 percent biomass in the predators,,that seems impossible.,How could 85 percent,survive on 15 percent? 
 ES: Well, imagine that you have two gears,of a watch, a big one and a small one.,The big one is moving very slowly, and the small one is moving fast.,That's basically it.,The animals at the lower parts of the food chain,,they reproduce very fast; they grow really fast; they produce millions of eggs.,Up there, you have sharks and large fish that live 25, 30 years.,They reproduce very slowly; they have a slow metabolism;,and, basically, they just maintain their biomass.,So, basically, the production surplus of these guys down there,is enough to maintain this biomass,that is not moving.,They are like capacitors of the system. 
 CA: That's very fascinating.,So, really, our picture of a food pyramid,is just -- we have to change that completely. 
 ES: At least in the seas.,What we found in coral reefs is that the inverted pyramid,is the equivalent of the Serengeti,,with five lions per wildebeest.,And on land, this cannot work.,But at least on coral reefs are systems,where there is a bottom component with structure.,We think this is universal.,But we have started studying pristine reefs,only very recently. 
 CA: So the numbers you presented really are astonishing.,You're saying we're spending 35 billion dollars,now on subsidies.,It would only cost 16 billion to set up,20 percent of the ocean as,marine protected areas,that actually give new living choices,to the fishermen as well.,If the world was a smarter place,,we could solve this problem for negative 19 billion dollars.,We've got 19 billion to spend on health care or something. 
 ES: And then we have the under-performance of fisheries,that is 50 billion dollars.,So again, one of the big solutions is,have the World Trade Organization shifting the subsidies,to sustainable practices. 
 CA: Okay, so there's a lot of examples that I'm hearing out there,about ending this subsidies madness.,So thank you for those numbers.,The last one's a personal question.,A lot of the experience of people here,who've been in the oceans for a long time,has just been seeing this degradation, the places they saw that were beautiful,getting worse, depressing.,Talk to me about the feeling that you must have experienced,of going to these pristine areas,and seeing things coming back. 
 ES: It is a spiritual experience.,We go there to try to understand the ecosystems,,to try to measure or count fish and sharks,and see how these places are different from the places we know.,But the best feeling,is this biophilia that E.O. Wilson talks about,,where humans have this sense of awe and wonder,in front of untamed nature, of raw nature.,And there, only there,,you really feel that you are part of a larger thing,or of a larger global ecosystem.,And if it were not for these places that show hope,,I don't think I could continue doing this job.,It would be just too depressing. 
 CA: Well, Enric, thank you so much for sharing,some of that spiritual experience with us all. Thank you. 
 ES: Thank you very much.I want to talk about,what we learn from conservatives.,And I'm at a stage in life where I'm yearning for my old days,,so I want to confess to you,that when I was a kid,,indeed, I was a conservative.,I was a Young Republican, a Teenage Republican,,a leader in the Teenage Republicans.,Indeed, I was the youngest member,of any delegation,in the 1980 convention that elected Ronald Reagan,to be the Republican nominee for president. 
 Now, I know what you're thinking.,(Laughter),You're thinking, "That's not what the Internets say.",You're thinking, "Wikipedia doesn't say this fact.",And indeed, this is just one of the examples,of the junk that flows across the tubes,in these Internets here.,Wikipedia reports that this guy,,this former congressman from Erie, Pennsylvania,was, at the age of 20, one of the youngest people,at the Republican National Convention,,but it's just not true.,(Laughter),Indeed, it drives me so nuts, let me just change this little fact here.,(Laughter),(Applause),All right. Okay, so ... perfect.,Perfect.,(Laughter),Okay, speaker Lawrence Lessig, right.,Okay.,Finally, truth will be brought here.,Okay, see? It's done. It's almost done. Here we go.,"... Youngest Republican," okay, we're finished.,That's it. Please save this.,Great, here we go.,And ... Wikipedia is fixed, finally.,Okay, but no, this is really besides the point. 
 (Applause) 
 But the thing I want you to think about when we think about conservatives --,not so much this issue of the 1980 convention --,the thing to think about is this:,They go to church.,Now, you know, I mean, a lot of people go to church.,I'm not talking about that only conservatives go to church.,And I'm not talking about the God thing.,I don't want to get into that, you know; that's not my point.,They go to church, by which I mean,,they do lots of things for free for each other.,They hold potluck dinners.,Indeed, they sell books about potluck dinners.,They serve food to poor people.,They share, they give,,they give away for free.,And it's the very same people,leading Wall Street firms,who, on Sundays, show up,and share.,And not only food, right. 
 These very same people,are strong believers, in lots of contexts,,in the limits on the markets.,They are in many important places,against markets.,Indeed, they, like all of us, celebrate this kind of relationship.,But they're very keen that we don't,let money drop into that relationship,,else it turns into something like this.,They want to regulate us, those conservatives,,to stop us from allowing the market to spread in those places.,Because they understand:,There are places for the market,and places where the market should not exist,,where we should be free,to enjoy the fellowship of others.,They recognize: Both of these things have to live together. 
 And the second great thing about conservatives:,they get ecology.,Right, it was the first great Republican president of the 20th century,who taught us about,environmental thinking -- Teddy Roosevelt.,They first taught us about ecology,in the context of natural resources.,And then they began to teach us in the context of,innovation, economics.,They understand, in that context,,"free." They understand "free" is an important,essential part of the,cultural ecology as well.,That's the thing I want you to think about them. 
 Now, I know,you don't believe me, really, here.,So here's exhibit number one.,I want to share with you my latest hero, Julian Sanchez,,a libertarian who works at the, for many people,,"evil" Cato Institute.,Okay, so Julian made this video.,He's a terrible producer of videos,,but it's great content, so I'm going to give you a little bit of it.,So here he is beginning. 
 Julian Sanchez: I'm going to make an observation about the way,remix culture seems to be evolving ... 
 Larry Lessig: So what he does is he begins to tell us,about these three videos.,This is this fantastic Brat Pack remix,set to Lisztomania.,Which, of course, spread virally.,Hugely successful. 
 (Music),And then some people from Brooklyn saw it.,They decided they wanted to do the same.,(Music),And then, of course, people from San Fransisco saw it.,And San Franciscans thought they had to do the same as well.,(Music),And so they're beautiful, but this libertarian,has some important lessons he wants us to learn from this.,Here's lesson number one. 
 JS: There's obviously also something really deeply great about this.,They are acting in the sense that they're,emulating the original mashup.,And the guy who shot it obviously has a strong eye,and some experience with video editing.,But this is also basically just a group of friends,having an authentic social moment,and screwing around together.,It should feel familiar and kind of resonate,for anyone who's had a sing-a-long or a dance party,with a group of good friends. 
 LL: Or ... 
 JS: So that's importantly different from the earlier videos we looked at,because here, remix isn't just about,an individual doing something alone in his basement;,it becomes an act of social creativity.,And it's not just that it yields,a different kind of product at the end,,it's that potentially it changes the way that we relate to each other.,All of our normal social interactions,become a kind of invitation,to this sort of collective expression.,It's our real social lives themselves,that are transmuted into art. 
 LL: And so then, what this libertarian draws from these two points ... 
 JS: One remix is about,individuals using our shared culture,as a kind of language to communicate something to an audience.,Stage two, social remix,,is really about using it to mediate,people's relationships to each other.,First, within each video,,the Brat Pack characters are used as a kind of template,for performing the social reality of each group.,But there's also a dialogue between the videos,,where, once the basic structure is established,,it becomes a kind of platform,for articulating the similarities and differences,between the groups' social and physical worlds. 
 LL: And then, here's for me,,the critical key to what,Julian has to say ... 
 JS: Copyright policy isn't just about,how to incentivize the production,of a certain kind of artistic commodity;,it's about what level of control,we're going to permit to be exercised,over our social realities --,social realities that are now inevitably,permeated by pop culture.,I think it's important that we,keep these two different kinds of public goods in mind.,If we're only focused on how to maximize,the supply of one,,I think we risk suppressing,this different and richer,and, in some ways, maybe even more important one. 
 LL: Right. Bingo. Point.,Freedom needs this opportunity,to both have the commercial success,of the great commercial works,and the opportunity,to build this different kind of culture.,And for that to happen, you need,ideas like fair use to be central and protected,,to enable this kind of innovation,,as this libertarian tells us,,between these two creative cultures,,a commercial and a sharing culture.,The point is they, he, here,,gets that culture. 
 Now, my concern is, we Dems,,too often, not so much.,All right, take for example this great company.,In the good old days when this Republican ran that company,,their greatest work was work that built on the past, right.,All of the great Disney works,were works that took works that,were in the public domain and remixed them,,or waited until they entered the public domain to remix them,,to celebrate this add-on remix creativity.,Indeed, Mickey Mouse himself, of course,,as "Steamboat Willie,",is a remix of the then, very dominant,,very popular "Steamboat Bill",by Buster Keaton.,This man was a remixer extraordinaire.,He is the celebration and ideal,of exactly this kind of creativity. 
 But then the company passes,through this dark stage,to this Democrat.,Wildly different.,This is the mastermind behind,the eventual passage of what we call,the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act,,extending the term of existing copyrights,by 20 years,,so that no one could do to Disney,what Disney did to the Brothers Grimm.,Now, when we tried to challenge this,,going to the Supreme Court, getting the Supreme Court, the bunch of conservatives there --,if we could get them to wake up to this -- to strike it down,,we had the assistance of Nobel Prize winners,including this right-wing,Nobel Prize winner, Milton Friedman,,who said he would join our brief,only if the word "no brainer",was in the brief somewhere.,(Laughter),But apparently, no brains,existed in this place,when Democrats passed and signed,this bill into law.,Now, tiny little quibble of a footnote:,Sonny Bono, you might say, was a Republican,,but I don't buy it.,This guy is no Republican. 
 Okay, for a second example,,think about this cultural hero,,icon on the Left,,creator of this character.,Look at the site that he built: "Star Wars" MashUps,,inviting people to come and use their creative energy,to produce a new generation of attention,towards this extraordinarily important cultural icon.,Read the license.,The license for these remixers,assigns all of the rights,to the remix back to Lucas.,The mashup is owned by Lucas.,Indeed, anything you add to the mashup,,music you might add,,Lucas has a worldwide perpetual right,to exploit that for free.,There is no creator here to be recognized.,The creator doesn't have any rights.,The creator is a sharecropper in this story.,And we should remember,who employed the sharecroppers:,the Democrats, right? 
 So the point is the Republicans here,recognize that there's a certain need,of ownership,,a respect for ownership,,the respect we should give the creator,,the remixer, the owner, the property owner,,the copyright owner,of this extraordinarily powerful stuff,,and not a generation of sharecroppers.,Now, I think there are lessons we should learn here,,lessons about openness.,Our lives are sharing activities,,at least in part.,Even for the head of Goldman Sachs,,at least in part.,And for that sharing activity to happen, we have to have,well-protected spaces of fair use. 
 That's number one. Number two:,This ecology of sharing,needs freedom,within which to create.,Freedom, which means without permission from anyone,,the ability to create.,And number three: We need to,respect the creator,,the creator of these remixes,through rights that are,directly tied to them.,Now, this explains the right-wing nonprofit,Creative Commons.,Actually, it's not a right-wing nonprofit,,but of course -- let me just tie it here --,the Creative Commons, which is,offering authors this simple way to mark their content,with the freedoms,they intended to carry. 
 So that we go from a "all rights reserved" world,to a "some rights reserved" world,so that people can know the freedoms they have attached to the content,,building and creating,on the basis of this,creative copyrighted work.,These tools that we built,enable this sharing in parts,through licenses that make it clear,and a freedom to create,without requiring permission first,because the permission has already been granted,and a respect for the creator because it builds upon,a copyright the creator,has licensed freely.,And it explains the vast right-wing conspiracy,that's obviously developed around these licenses,,as now more than 350 million digital objects,are out there, licensed freely,in this way. 
 Now that picture of an ecology of creativity,,the picture of an ecology,of balanced creativity,,is that the ecology of creativity we have right now?,Well, as you all know,,not many of us believe we do.,I tripped on the reality of this ecology of creativity,just last week.,I created a video which was based,on a Wireside Chat that I'd given,,and I uploaded it to YouTube.,I then got this email from YouTube,weirdly notifying me,that there was content in that,owned by the mysterious WMG,that matched their content ID.,So I didn't think much about it. 
 And then on Twitter, somebody said to me,,"Your talk on YouTube was DMCA'd. Was that your purpose?",imagining that I had this deep conspiracy,to reveal the obvious flaws in the DMCA.,I answered, "No." I didn't even think about it.,But then I went to the site,and all of the audio in my site had been silenced.,My whole 45-minute video,had been silenced,because there were snippets in that video,,a video about fair use,,that included Warner Music Group music.,Now, interestingly,,they still sold ads for that music,,if you played the silent video.,You could still buy the music,,but you couldn't hear anything,because it had been silenced. 
 So I did what the current regime,says I must do,to be free to use,YouTube to talk about fair use.,I went to this site, and I had to answer these questions.,And then in an extraordinarily,Bart Simpson-like, juvenile way,you've actually got to type out these words,and get them right,to reassert your freedom to speak.,And I felt like I was in third grade again.,"I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair.,I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair.",This is absurd.,It is outrageous.,It is an extraordinary perversion of the system of freedom,we should be encouraging. 
 And the question I ask you is: Who's fighting it?,Well, interestingly, in the last presidential election,,who was the number one, active,opponent of this system of regulation,in online speech?,John McCain.,Letter after letter attacking YouTube's refusal,to be more respectful of fair use,with their extraordinary notice and take down system,,that led his campaign so many times,to be thrown off the Internet. 
 Now, that was the story of me then,,my good old days of right-wing lunacy.,Let me come back to now,,now when I'm a little leftist --,I'm certainly left-handed, so at least a lefty --,And I wonder, can we on the Left,expect to build this,ecology of freedom, now,,in a world where,we know the extraordinarily powerful,influences against it,,where even icons of the Left like this,entertain and push bills,that would effectively ban the requirement,of open access for government-funded research?,The president, who has supported,a process that secretly negotiates agreements,,which effectively lock us into the insane system,of DMCA,that we have adopted,and likely lock us down a path of three strikes, you're out,that, of course, the rest of the world are increasingly adopting.,Not a single example of reform,has been produced yet.,And we're not going to see this change,in this system,anytime soon. 
 So here's the lessons of openness,that I think we need to learn.,Openness is a commitment,to a certain set of values.,We need to speak of those values.,The value of freedom. It's a value of community.,It's a value of the limits in regulation.,It's a value respecting the creator.,Now, if we can learn those values,from at least some influences on the Right,,if we can take them and incorporate them,,maybe we could do a little trade.,We learn those values on the Left,,and maybe they'll do health care,or global warming legislation or something in the Right. 
 Anyway, please join me,in teaching these values. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)For the next few minutes we're going to talk about energy,,and it's going to be a bit of a varied talk.,I'll try to spin a story about energy,,and oil's a convenient starting place.,The talk will be broadly about energy,,but oil's a good place to start.,And one of the reasons is this is remarkable stuff.,You take about eight or so carbon atoms,,about 20 hydrogen atoms,,you put them together in exactly the right way,and you get this marvelous liquid:,very energy-dense and very easy to refine,into a number of very useful products and fuels.,It's great stuff.,Now, as far as it goes,,there's a lot of oil out there in the world. 
 Here's my little pocket map,of where it's all located.,A bigger one for you to look at.,But this is it, this is the oil in the world.,Geologists have a pretty good idea of where the oil is.,This is about 100 trillion gallons,of crude oil,still to be developed and produced in the world today.,Now, that's just one story about oil,,and we could end it there and say,,"Well, oil's going to last forever,because, well, there's just a lot of it.",But there's actually more to the story than that.,Oh, by the way, if you think you're very far from some of this oil,,1000 meters below where you're all sitting,is one of the largest producing oil fields in the world.,Come talk to me about it, I'll fill in some of the details if you want. 
 So, that's one of the stories of oil; there's just a lot of it.,But what about oil? Where is it in the energy system?,Here's a little snapshot of 150 years of oil,,and it's been a dominant part of our energy system,for most of those 150 years.,Now, here's another little secret I'm going to tell you about:,For the last 25 years,,oil has been playing less and less of a role,in global energy systems.,There was one kind of peak oil in 1985,,when oil represented 50 percent of global energy supply.,Now, it's about 35 percent.,It's been declining,and I believe it will continue to decline.,Gasoline consumption in the U.S. probably peaked in 2007,and is declining. 
 So oil is playing a less significant role,every year.,And so, 25 years ago,,there was a peak oil;,just like, in the 1920s,,there was a peak coal;,and a hundred years before that,,there was a peak wood.,This is a very important picture of the evolution of energy systems.,And what's been taking up the slack in the last few decades?,Well, a lot of natural gas,and a little bit of nuclear, for starters.,And what goes on in the future?,Well, I think out ahead of us a few decades,is peak gas,,and beyond that,,peak renewables. 
 Now, I'll tell you another little, very important,story about this picture.,Now, I'm not pretending that energy use in total,isn't increasing, it is --,that's another part of the story. Come talk to me about it,,we'll fill in some of the details --,but there's a very important message here:,This is 200 years of history,,and for 200 years we've been systematically decarbonizing,our energy system.,Energy systems of the world,becoming progressively -- year on year,,decade on decade, century on century --,becoming less carbon intense.,And that continues into the future,with the renewables that we're developing today,,reaching maybe 30 percent of primary energy,by mid century.,Now that might be the end of the story --,Okay, we just replace it all with conventional renewables --,but I think, actually, there's more to the story than that. 
 And to tell the next part of the story --,and this is looking out say 2100 and beyond.,What is the future,of truly sustainable, carbon-free energy?,Well, we have to take a little excursion,,and we'll start in central Texas.,Here's a piece of limestone.,I picked it up outside of Marble Falls, Texas.,It's about 400 million years old.,And it's just limestone, nothing really special about it.,Now, here's a piece of chalk.,I picked this up at MIT. It's a little younger.,And it's different than this limestone, you can see that.,You wouldn't build a building out of this stuff,,and you wouldn't try to give a lecture and write on the chalkboard with this.,Yeah, it's very different -- no, it's not different.,It's not different, it's the same stuff:,calcium carbonate, calcium carbonate.,What's different is how the molecules are put together. 
 Now, if you think that's kind of neat,,the story gets really neat right now.,Off the coast of California comes this:,It's an abalone shell.,Now, millions of abalone every year,make this shell.,Oh, by the way, just in case you weren't already guessing,,it's calcium carbonate.,It's the same stuff as this,and the same stuff as this.,But it's not the same stuff; it's different.,It's thousands of times,,maybe 3,000 times tougher than this.,And why? Because the lowly abalone,is able to lay down,the calcium carbonate crystals in layers,,making this beautiful, iridescent,mother of pearl.,Very specialized material,that the abalone self-assembles,,millions of abalone,,all the time, every day, every year.,This is pretty incredible stuff.,All the same, what's different?,How the molecules are put together. 
 Now, what does this have to do with energy?,Here's a piece of coal.,And I'll suggest that this coal,is about as exciting,as this chalk.,Now, whether we're talking about fuels,or energy carriers,,or perhaps novel materials for batteries,or fuel cells,,nature hasn't ever built those perfect materials yet,because nature didn't need to.,Nature didn't need to because, unlike the abalone shell,,the survival of a species didn't depend,on building those materials,,until maybe now when it might just matter.,So, when we think about the future of energy,,imagine,what would it be like,if instead of this,,we could build the energy equivalent of this,just by rearranging the molecules differently. 
 And so that is my story.,The oil will never run out.,It's not because we have a lot of it.,It's not because we're going to build a bajillion windmills.,It's because, well,,thousands of years ago,,people invented ideas --,they had ideas, innovations, technology --,and the Stone Age ended,,not because we ran out of stones.,(Laughter),It's ideas, it's innovation, it's technology,that will end the age of oil, long before we run out of oil. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)It can be a very complicated thing, the ocean.,And it can be a very complicated thing, what human health is.,And bringing those two together might seem a very daunting task,,but what I'm going to try to say is that,even in that complexity,,there's some simple themes that I think,,if we understand, we can really move forward.,And those simple themes aren't really,themes about the complex science of what's going on,,but things that we all pretty well know.,And I'm going to start with this one:,If momma ain't happy, ain't nobody happy.,We know that, right? We've experienced that.,And if we just take that,and we build from there,,then we can go to the next step,,which is that if the ocean ain't happy,,ain't nobody happy.,That's the theme of my talk.,And we're making the ocean pretty unhappy in a lot of different ways. 
 This is a shot of Cannery Row in 1932.,Cannery Row, at the time,,had the biggest industrial,canning operation on the west coast.,We piled enormous amounts of pollution,into the air and into the water.,Rolf Bolin, who was a professor,at the Hopkin's Marine Station where I work,,wrote in the 1940s that,"The fumes from the scum floating on the inlets of the bay,were so bad they turned,lead-based paints black.",People working in these canneries,could barely stay there all day because of the smell,,but you know what they came out saying?,They say, "You know what you smell?,You smell money.",That pollution was money to that community,,and those people dealt with the pollution,and absorbed it into their skin and into their bodies,because they needed the money.,We made the ocean unhappy; we made people very unhappy,,and we made them unhealthy. 
 The connection between ocean health and human health,is actually based upon another couple simple adages,,and I want to call that,"pinch a minnow, hurt a whale.",The pyramid of ocean life ...,Now, when an ecologist looks at the ocean -- I have to tell you --,we look at the ocean in a very different way,,and we see different things than when a regular person looks at the ocean,because when an ecologist looks at the ocean,,we see all those interconnections.,We see the base of the food chain,,the plankton, the small things,,and we see how those animals,are food to animals in the middle of the pyramid,,and on so up this diagram.,And that flow, that flow of life,,from the very base up to the very top,,is the flow that ecologists see.,And that's what we're trying to preserve,when we say, "Save the ocean. Heal the ocean.",It's that pyramid. 
 Now why does that matter for human health?,Because when we jam things in the bottom,of that pyramid that shouldn't be there,,some very frightening things happen.,Pollutants, some pollutants have been created by us:,molecules like PCBs,that can't be broken down by our bodies.,And they go in the base of that pyramid,,and they drift up; they're passed up that way,,on to predators and on to the top predators,,and in so doing,,they accumulate. 
 Now, to bring that home, I thought I'd invent a little game.,We don't really have to play it; we can just think about it here.,It's the Styrofoam and chocolate game.,Imagine that when we got on this boat,,we were all given,two Styrofoam peanuts.,Can't do much with them: Put them in your pocket.,Suppose the rules are: every time you offer somebody a drink,,you give them the drink,,and you give them your Styrofoam peanuts too.,What'll happen is that the Styrofoam peanuts,will start moving through our society here,,and they will accumulate in,the drunkest, stingiest people.,(Laughter),There's no mechanism in this game,for them to go anywhere but into,a bigger and bigger pile,of indigestible Styrofoam peanuts.,And that's exactly what happens with PDBs,in this food pyramid:,They accumulate into the top of it. 
 Now suppose, instead of Styrofoam peanuts,,we take these lovely little chocolates that we get,and we had those instead.,Well, some of us would be eating those chocolates,instead of passing them around,,and instead of accumulating,,they will just pass into our group here,and not accumulate in any one group,because they're absorbed by us.,And that's the difference between a PCB,and, say, something natural like an omega-3,,something we want out of the marine food chain. 
 PCBs accumulate.,We have great examples of that, unfortunately.,PCBs accumulate in dolphins,in Sarasota Bay, in Texas, in North Carolina.,They get into the food chain.,The dolphins eat the fish,that have PCBs from the plankton,,and those PCBs, being fat-soluble,,accumulate in these dolphins.,Now, a dolphin,,mother dolphin, any dolphin --,there's only one way,that a PCB can get out of a dolphin.,And what's that?,In mother's milk.,Here's a diagram of the PCB load,of dolphins in Sarasota Bay.,Adult males: a huge load.,Juveniles: a huge load.,Females after their first calf is already weaned:,a lower load.,Those females, they're not trying to.,Those females are passing the PCBs,in the fat of their own mother's milk,into their offspring,,and their offspring don't survive.,The death rate in these dolphins,,for the first calf born of every female dolphin,,is 60 to 80 percent.,These mothers pump their first offspring,full of this pollutant,,and most of them die.,Now, the mother then can go and reproduce,,but what a terrible price to pay,for the accumulation of this pollutant,in these animals --,the death of the first-born calf. 
 There's another top predator in the ocean, it turns out.,That top predator, of course, is us.,And we also are eating meat,that comes from some of these same places.,This is whale meat,that I photographed in a grocery store in Tokyo --,or is it?,In fact, what we did a few years ago,was learn how to smuggle,a molecular biology lab into Tokyo,and use it to genetically test the DNA,out of whale meat samples,and identify what they really were.,And some of those whale meat samples were whale meat.,Some of them were illegal whale meat, by the way.,That's another story.,But some of them were not whale meat at all.,Even though they were labeled whale meat, they were dolphin meat.,Some of them were dolphin liver. Some of them were dolphin blubber.,And those dolphin parts,had a huge load of PCBs,,dioxins and heavy metals.,And that huge load was passing into the people,that ate this meat.,It turns out that a lot of dolphins,are being sold as meat,in the whale meat market around the world.,That's a tragedy for those populations,,but it's also a tragedy,for the people eating them,because they don't know that that's toxic meat. 
 We had these data a few years ago.,I remember sitting at my desk,being about the only person in the world,who knew that whale meat being sold in these markets,was really dolphin meat, and it was toxic.,It had two-to-three-to-400 times the toxic loads,ever allowed by the EPA.,And I remember there sitting at my desk thinking,,"Well, I know this. This is a great scientific discovery,",but it was so awful.,And for the very first time in my scientific career,,I broke scientific protocol,,which is that you take the data and publish them in scientific journals,and then begin to talk about them.,We sent a very polite letter,to the Minister of Health in Japan,and simply pointed out that,this is an intolerable situation, not for us,,but for the people of Japan,because mothers who may be breastfeeding,,who may have young children,,would be buying something that they thought was healthy,,but it was really toxic.,That led to a whole series of other campaigns in Japan,,and I'm really proud to say that at this point,,it's very difficult to buy anything in Japan,that's labeled incorrectly,,even though they're still selling whale meat,,which I believe they shouldn't.,But at least it's labeled correctly,,and you're no longer going to be buying,toxic dolphin meat instead. 
 It isn't just there that this happens,,but in a natural diet of some communities,in the Canadian arctic and in the United States,and in the European arctic,,a natural diet of seals and whales,leads to an accumulation of PCBs,that have gathered up from all parts of the world,and ended up in these women.,These women have toxic breast milk.,They cannot feed their offspring, their children,,their breast milk,because of the accumulation of these toxins,in their food chain,,in their part of the world's,ocean pyramid.,That means their immune systems are compromised.,It means that their children's development,can be compromised.,And the world's attention on this over the last decade,has reduced the problem,for these women,,not by changing the pyramid,,but by changing what they particularly eat out of it.,We've taken them out of their natural pyramid,in order to solve this problem.,That's a good thing for this particular acute problem,,but it does nothing to solve the pyramid problem. 
 There's other ways of breaking the pyramid.,The pyramid, if we jam things in the bottom,,can get backed up like a sewer line that's clogged.,And if we jam nutrients, sewage, fertilizer,in the base of that food pyramid,,it can back up all through it.,We end up with things we've heard about before:,red tides, for example,,which are blooms of toxic algae,floating through the oceans,causing neurological damage.,We can also see blooms of bacteria,,blooms of viruses in the ocean.,These are two shots of a red tide coming on shore here,and a bacteria,in the genus vibrio,,which includes the genus that has cholera in it.,How many people have seen a "beach closed" sign?,Why does that happen?,It happens because we have jammed so much,into the base of the natural ocean pyramid,that these bacteria clog it up,and overfill onto our beaches.,Often what jams us up is sewage. 
 Now how many of you have ever gone to a state park or a national park,where you had a big sign at the front saying,,"Closed because human sewage,is so far over this park,that you can't use it"?,Not very often. We wouldn't tolerate that.,We wouldn't tolerate our parks,being swamped by human sewage,,but beaches are closed a lot in our country.,They're closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason,,and I believe we shouldn't tolerate that either.,It's not just a question of cleanliness;,it's also a question of,how those organisms,then turn into human disease.,These vibrios, these bacteria, can actually infect people.,They can go into your skin and create skin infections. 
 This is a graph from NOAA's ocean and human health initiative,,showing the rise of the infections,by vibrio in people,over the last few years.,Surfers, for example, know this incredibly.,And if you can see on some surfing sites,,in fact, not only do you see,what the waves are like or what the weather's like,,but on some surf rider sites,,you see a little flashing poo alert.,That means that the beach might have great waves,,but it's a dangerous place for surfers to be,because they can carry with them,,even after a great day of surfing,,this legacy of an infection that might take a very long time to solve.,Some of these infections are actually carrying,antibiotic resistance genes now,,and that makes them even more difficult. 
 These same infections,create harmful algal blooms.,Those blooms are generating other kinds of chemicals.,This is just a simple list of some of the types of poisons,that come out of these harmful algal blooms:,shellfish poisoning,fish ciguatera,,diarrheic shellfish poisoning -- you don't want to know about that --,neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, paralytic shellfish poisoning.,These are things that are getting into our food chain,because of these blooms.,Rita Calwell very famously,traced a very interesting story,of cholera into human communities,,brought there, not by,a normal human vector,,but by a marine vector, this copepod.,Copepods are small crustaceans.,They're a tiny fraction of an inch long,,and they can carry on their little legs,some of the cholera bacteria,that then leads to human disease.,That has sparked cholera epidemics,in ports along the world,and has led to increased concentration,on trying to make sure shipping,doesn't move these,vectors of cholera around the world. 
 So what do you do?,We have major problems in disrupted ecosystem flow,that the pyramid may not be working so well,,that the flow from the base up into it,is being blocked and clogged.,What do you do when you have this sort of disrupted flow?,Well, there's a bunch of things you could do.,You could call Joe the Plumber, for example.,And he could come in,and fix the flow.,But in fact, if you look around the world,,not only are there hope spots,for where we may be able to fix problems,,there have been places where problems have been fixed,,where people have come to grips with these issues,and begun to turn them around.,Monterey is one of those. 
 I started out showing how much,we had distressed the Monterey Bay ecosystem,with pollution and the canning industry,and all of the attendant problems.,In 1932, that's the picture.,In 2009, the picture is dramatically different.,The canneries are gone. The pollution has abated.,But there's a greater sense here,that what the individual communities need,is working ecosystems.,They need a functioning pyramid from the base all the way to the top.,And that pyramid,in Monterey, right now,,because of the efforts of a lot of different people,,is functioning better than it's ever functioned,for the last 150 years. 
 It didn't happen accidentally.,It happened because many people put their time and effort,and their pioneering spirit into this.,On the left there, Julia Platt,,the mayor of my little hometown in Pacific Grove.,At 74 years old, became mayor,because something had to be done,to protect the ocean.,In 1931, she produced California's first,community-based marine protected area,,right next to the biggest polluting cannery,,because Julia knew,that when the canneries eventually were gone,,the ocean needed a place to grow from,,that the ocean needed a place to spark a seed,,and she wanted to provide that seed. 
 Other people, like David Packard and Julie Packard,,who were instrumental in producing the Monterey Bay aquarium,to lock into people's notion,that the ocean,and the health of the ocean ecosystem,were just as important to the economy of this area,as eating the ecosystem would be.,That change in thinking has led to a dramatic shift,,not only in the fortunes of Monterey Bay,,but other places around the world. 
 Well, I want to leave you with the thought that,what we're really trying to do here,is protect this ocean pyramid,,and that ocean pyramid,connects to our own pyramid of life.,It's an ocean planet,,and we think of ourselves as a terrestrial species,,but the pyramid of life in the ocean,and our own lives on land,are intricately connected.,And it's only through having the ocean being healthy,that we can remain healthy ourselves. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Cartoons are basically short stories.,I tried to find one that didn't have a whole lot of words.,Not all of them have happy endings.,So how did I get started cartooning?,I doodled a lot as a kid,,and if you spend enough time doodling,,sooner or later, something happens:,all your career options run out.,So you have to make a living cartooning. 
 Actually, I fell in love with the ocean when I was a little boy,,when I was about eight or nine.,And I was particularly fascinated with sharks.,This is some of my early work.,Eventually, my mom took the red crayon away,,so it was [unclear].,But I'd like to relay to you a childhood experience of mine,that really made me see the ocean differently,,and it's become the foundation of my work,because, I feel like, if in a day,,I can see the ocean differently,,then I can evoke that same kind of change in others,,especially kids.,Before that day, this is how I saw the ocean.,It's just a big blue surface.,And this is how we've seen the ocean since the beginning of time.,It's a mystery.,There's been a lot of folklore,developed around the ocean,,mostly negative.,And that prompted people to make maps like this,,with all kinds of wonderful detail on the land,,but when you get to the waters edge,,the ocean looks like one giant puddle of blue paint.,And this is the way I saw the ocean at school --,as if to say, "All geography and science lessons,stop at water's edge.,This part's not going to be on the test." 
 But that day I flew low over the islands --,it was a family trip to the Caribbean,,and I flew in a small plane low over the islands.,This is what I saw. I saw hills and valleys.,I saw forests and meadows.,I saw grottoes and secret gardens,and places I'd love to hide as a kid,,if I could only breathe underwater.,And best of all, I saw the animals.,I saw a manta ray that looked as big as the plane I was flying in.,And I flew over a lagoon with a shark in it,,and that was the day that my comic strip about a shark was born. 
 So from that day on, I was an ordinary kid,walking around on dry land,,but my head was down there, underwater.,Up until that day,,these were the animals that were most common in my life.,These were the ones I'd like to draw --,all variations of four legs and fur.,But when you got to the ocean,,my imagination was no competition for nature.,Every time I'd come up with a crazy cartoon character on the drawing board,,I'd find a critter in the ocean that was even crazier.,And the differences in scale between this tiny sea dragon,and this enormous humpback whale,was like something out of a science-fiction movie. 
 Whenever I talk to kids, I always like to tell them,,the biggest animal that ever lived is still alive.,It's not a dinosaur; it's a whale,,animals as big as office buildings,still swimming around out there in our ocean.,Speaking of dinosaurs, sharks are basically,the same fish they were 300 million years ago.,So if you ever fantasize about going back in time,and seeing what a dinosaur looked like,,that's what a dinosaur looks like.,So you have living dinosaurs,and space aliens,,animals that evolved in zero gravity in harsh conditions.,It's just incredible; no Hollywood designer,could come up with something more interesting than that.,Or this fangtooth. The particles in the water,make it look like it's floating in outer space.,Could you image if we looked through the Hubble Telescope,and we saw that?,It would start a whole new space race.,But instead, we stick a camera in the deep ocean,,and we see a fish, and it doesn't capture our imagination,as a society.,We say to ourselves,,"Maybe we can make fish sticks with it or something." 
 So, what I'd like to do now,is try a little drawing.,So, I'm going to try to draw this fangtooth here.,I love to draw the deep sea fish,,because they are so ugly,,but beautiful in their own way.,Maybe we can give him a little bioluminescence here --,give him a headlight,,maybe a brake light,,turn signals.,But it's easy to see why these animals,make such great cartoon characters,,their shapes and sizes.,So some of them actually seem to have powers,like superheroes in a comic book.,For instance,,take these sea turtles.,They kind of have a sixth sense,like Superman's x-ray vision.,They can sense the magnetic fields of the earth.,And they can use that sense,to navigate hundreds of miles of open ocean.,I kind of give my turtle hands,just to make them an easier cartoon character to work with.,Or take this sea cucumber.,It's not an animal we draw cartoons of,or draw at all.,He's like an underwater Spiderman.,He shoots out these sticky webs,to entangle his enemy.,Of course, sea cucumbers shoot them out their rears,,which, in my opinion, makes them much more interesting a superhero.,(Laughter),He can't spin a web anytime; he's got to pull his pants down first. 
 (Laughter) 
 Or the blowfish.,The blowfish is like the Incredible Hulk.,It can change its body,into a big, intimidating fish,in a matter of seconds.,I'm going to draw this blowfish uninflated.,And then I'm going to attempt,onscreen animation here.,Let's see.,Try and inflate it.,(Laughter),"You talkin' to me?" See, he can inflate himself,when he wants to be intimidating.,Or take this swordfish.,Could you imagine being born with a tool for a nose?,Do you think he wakes up in the morning, looks in the mirror and says,,"Somebody's getting stabbed today.",Or this lionfish for instance.,Imagine trying to make friends,covered with razor-sharp poisonous barbs.,It's not something you want to put on your Facebook page, right? 
 My characters are --,my lead character's a shark named Sherman.,He's a great white shark.,And I kind of broke the mold with Sherman.,I didn't want to go with this ruthless,predator image.,He's kind of just out there making a living.,He's sort of a Homer Simpson with fins.,And then his sidekick,is a sea turtle, as I mentioned before, named Filmore.,He uses his wonderful skills at navigation,to wander the oceans, looking for a mate.,And he does manage to find them,,but great navigation skills, lousy pick-up lines.,He never seems,to settle on,any particular girl.,I have a hermit crab named Hawthorne,,who doesn't get a lot of respect as a hermit crab,,so he kind of wishes,he were a great white shark.,And then I'll introduce you to one more character,,this guy, Ernest,,who is basically a juvenile delinquent,in a fish body. 
 So with characters, you can make stories.,Sometimes making a story is as easy,as putting two characters in a room,and seeing what happens.,So, imagine a great white shark and a giant squid in the same bathroom.,(Laughter),Or, sometimes I take them to places,that people have never heard of because they're underwater.,For instance, I took them skiing in the Mid-Atlantic Range,,which is this range of mountains in the middle of the Atlantic.,I've taken them to the Sea of Japan,,where they met giant jellyfish.,I've taken them camping in the kelp forests of California. 
 This next one here,,I did a story on the census of marine life.,And that was a lot of fun because, as most of you know,,it's a real project we've heard about.,But it was a chance for me to introduce readers,to a lot of crazy undersea characters.,So we start off the story with Ernest,,who volunteers as a census taker.,He goes down and he meets this famous anglerfish.,Then he meets the yeti crab,,the famous vampire squid -- elusive, hard to find --,and the Dumbo octopus, which looks so much like a cartoon in real life,that really didn't have to change a thing when I drew it. 
 I did another story on marine debris.,I was speaking to a lot of my friends,in the conservation business,,and they --,I asked them, "So what's one issue you would like everyone to know more about?",And they said -- this one friend of mine said,,"I've got one word for you: plastic.",And I told him, "Well, I need something a little sexier than that.,Plastic just is not going to do it.",We sort of worked things out.,He wanted me to use words like polyvinyl chloride,,which doesn't really work in voice balloons very well.,I couldn't fit them in.,So what I did was I made an adventure strip. 
 Basically, this bottle travels a long way.,What I'm trying to tell readers,is that plastic doesn't really go away;,it just continues to wash downstream.,And a lot of it ends up washing into the ocean,,which is a great story if you attach a couple characters to it,,especially if they can't stand each other, like these two.,So, I sent them to Boise, Idaho,,where they dropped a plastic bottle,into the Boise sewer system.,And it ended up in the Boise River,and then on to the Columbia River,and then to the mouth of the Columbia,and to the Pacific Ocean,and then on to this place called the Great Pacific Garbage Patch --,which is this giant Pacific gyre in the North Pacific,,where a lot of this plastic ends up floating around --,and then back onto the lagoon.,So that was basically a buddy story,with a plastic bottle following along.,So a lot of people remember the plastic bottle anyway,,but we really talked about marine debris and plastic,in the course of that one. 
 The third storyline I did about a year and a half ago,was probably my most difficult.,It was on shark finning, and I felt really strongly,about this issue.,And I felt like, since my main character was a shark,,the comic strip was a perfect vehicle for telling the public about this.,Now, finning is the act,of taking a shark, cutting the valuable fins off,and throwing the live animal back in the water.,It's cruel, it's wasteful.,There's nothing funny or entertaining about it,,but I really wanted to take this issue on.,I had to kill my main character, who is a shark. 
 We start with Sherman in a Chinese restaurant,,who gets a fortune that he's about to get caught by a trawler,,which he does.,And then he dies.,He gets finned, and then he gets thrown overboard.,Ostensibly, he's dead now.,And so I killed a character that's been in the newspaper for 15 years.,So I got a lot of reader feedback on that one.,Meanwhile, the other characters are talking about shark fin soup.,I do three or four strips after that,where we explore the finning issue,and the shark fin soup issue.,Sherman's up in shark heaven.,This is what I love about comic strips, you know.,You really don't have to worry about the audience suspending its sense of disbelief,because, if you start with a talking shark,,readers pretty much check their disbelief at the door.,You can kind of do anything.,It becomes a near-death experience for Sherman.,Meanwhile, Ernest finds his fins on the internet.,There was a real website based in China,that actually sold shark fins,,so I kind of exposed that.,And he clicks the "buy now" button.,And voila, next-day air, they show up,,and they surgically reattach them.,I ended that series with a kind of a mail-in petition,that encouraged our National Marine Fishery Service,,to force other countries,to have a stronger stance with shark management. 
 (Applause) 
 Thanks.,I'd like to end with a little metaphor here.,I've been trying to think of a metaphor to represent Mission Blue,,and this is what I came up with.,Imagine you're in an enormous room,,and it's as dark as a cave.,And you can have anything in that room, anything you want,,but you can't see anything.,You've been given one tool, a hammer.,So you wander around in the darkness, and you bump into something,,and it feels like it's made of stone.,It's big, it's heavy. You can't carry it away,,so you bang it with your hammer, and you break off a piece.,And you take the piece out into the daylight.,And you see you have a beautiful piece of white alabaster.,So you say to yourself, "Well, that's worth something.",So you go back into the room,,and you break this thing to pieces, and you haul it away.,And you find other things, and you break that up, and you haul those away.,And you're getting all kinds of cool stuff.,And you hear other people doing the same thing.,So you get this sense of urgency,,like you need to find as much stuff as possible as soon as possible.,And then some yells, "Stop!",And they turn up the lights.,And you realize where you are; you're in the Louvre.,And you've taken all this complexity and beauty,,and you've turned it into a cheap commodity. 
 And that's what we're doing with the ocean.,And part of what Mission Blue is about,is yelling, "Stop!",so that each of us --,explorer, scientist, cartoonist, singer, chef --,can turn up the lights in their own way.,And that's what I hope my comic strip does in a small way.,That's why I like what I do. 
 Thanks for listening. 
 (Applause)Hi there.,I'm going to be talking a little bit about,music, machines and life.,Or, more specifically,,what we learned from the creation of a very large and complicated machine,for a music video.,Some of you may recognize this image.,This is the opening frame of the video that we created.,We'll be showing the video at the end,,but before we do, I want to talk a little bit about,what it is that they wanted. 
 Now, when we first started talking to OK Go --,the name of the song is "This Too Shall Pass" --,we were really excited because,they expressed interest in building a machine that they could dance with.,And we were very excited about this,because, of course,,they have a history of dancing with machines.,They're responsible for this video, "Here It Goes Again.",50-million-plus views on YouTube.,Four guys dancing on treadmills,,no cuts, just a static camera.,A fantastically viral and wonderful video.,So we were really excited about working with them.,And we sort of started talking about what it is that they wanted.,And they explained that they wanted,kind of a Rube Goldberg machine. 
 Now, for those of you who don't know,,a Rube Goldberg machine,is a complicated contraption,,an incredibly over-engineered piece of machinery,that accomplishes a relatively simple task.,So we were excited by this idea,,and we started talking about,exactly what it would look like.,And we came up with some parameters, because,,you know, building a Rube Goldberg machine,has limitations,,but it also is pretty wide open. 
 And we wanted to make sure that we did something,that would work for a music video.,So we came up with a list of requirements,,the "10 commandments,",and they were, in order of ascending difficulty:,The first is "No magic.",Everything that happened on screen had to be,very easily understood by a typical viewer.,The rule of thumb was that, if my mother couldn't understand it,,then we couldn't use it in the video.,They wanted band integration,,that is, the machine acting upon the band members,,specifically not the other way around.,They wanted the machine action to follow the song feeling.,So as the song picks up emotion,,so should the machine,get grander in its process.,They wanted us to make use of the space.,So we have this 10,000-square-foot warehouse we were using,,divided between two floors.,It included an exterior loading dock.,We used all of that, including a giant hole in the floor,that we actually descended the camera and cameraman through.,They wanted it messy, and we were happy to oblige.,The machine itself would start the music.,So the machine would get started,,it would travel some distance,,reacting along the way,,hit play on an iPod or a tape deck,or something that would start playback.,And the machine would maintain synchronization throughout.,And speaking of synchronization,,they wanted it to sync to the rhythm,and to hit specific beats along the way.,Okay. (Laughter),They wanted it to end precisely on time.,Okay, so now the start to finish timing has to be perfect.,And they wanted the music to drop out,at a certain point in the video,and actual live audio from the machine,to play part of the song.,And as if that wasn't enough,,all of these incredibly complicating things, right,,they wanted it in one shot. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Okay.,So, just some statistics,about what we went through in the process.,The machine itself has,89 distinct interactions.,It took us 85 takes,to get it on film,to our satisfaction.,Of those 85 takes,,only three actually successfully completed their run.,We destroyed two pianos,and 10 televisions in the process.,We went to Home Depot well over a hundred times.,(Laughter),And we lost one high-heeled shoe,when one of our engineers, Heather Knight,,left her high-heeled shoe -- after a nice dinner,,and returned back to the build --,and left it in a pile of stuff.,And another engineer thought, "Well, that would be a really good thing to use",and ended up using it as a really nice trigger.,And it's actually in the machine. 
 So what did we learn from all of this?,Well, having completed this,,we have the opportunity to step back and reflect,on some of the things.,And we learned that small stuff stinks.,Little balls in wooden tracks,are really susceptible to,humidity and temperature and a little bit of dust,,and they fall out of the tracks,,the exact angles makes it hard to get right.,And yet, a bowling ball will always follow the same path.,It doesn't matter what temperature it is,,doesn't matter what's in its way;,it will pretty much get where it needs to go.,But as much as the small stuff stinks, we needed somewhere to start,,so that we would have somewhere to go.,And so you have to start with it. You have to focus on it.,Small stuff stinks,,but, of course, it's essential, right? 
 What else? Planning is incredibly important.,(Laughter),You know, we spent a lot of time ideating,and even building some of these things.,It's been said that, "No battle plan,survives contact with the enemy.",I think our enemy was physics --,(Laughter),and she's a cruel mistress.,Often, we had to pull things out as a result,because of timing or aesthetics or whatever.,And so while planning is important, so is flexibility.,These are all things that ended up,not making it into the final machine.,So also, put reliable stuff last,,the stuff that's going to run every time.,Again, small to large is relevant here.,The little Lego car in the beginning of the video,references the big, real car,near the end of the video.,The big, real car works every time; there's no problem about it.,The little one had a tendency to try to run off the track,and that's a problem.,But you don't want to have to reset the whole machine,because the Lego car at the end doesn't work, right.,So you put that up front so that, if it fails,,at least you know,you don't have to reset the whole thing. 
 Life can be,messy.,There were incredibly difficult moments in the building of this thing.,Months were spent in this tiny, cold warehouse.,And the wonderful elation that we had,when we finally completed it.,So it's important to remember that whether it's good or it's bad,,"This Too Shall Pass." 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause),And now to introduce 
 their music video,,we have OK Go. 
 OK Go: An introduction. Hello TEDxUSC.,We are OK Go.,What are we doing? Oh, just hanging out with our Grammy. What what!,It think we can do better than this. Hello TEDxUSC.,We are OK Go. Have you read the "Natural Curiosity Cabinet?",I mean, "Curiosity" -- excuse me.,Let me start again.,We need some more ridiculous things besides "The Cabinet of Natural Curiosities.",Tim's sundial hat.,Have you seen the new work they've done to the Waltz Towers?,Sorry, start again.,(Barking),Dogs.,Hello, TEDxUSC. We are OK Go,,and this our new video, "This Too Shall Pass.",[unclear],Kay, we can still do one better I think, yeah.,That one's pretty good. It's getting better.

 (Cheering)I heard this amazing story about Miuccia Prada.,She's an Italian fashion designer.,She goes to this vintage store in Paris,with a friend of hers.,She's rooting around, she finds this one jacket by Balenciaga --,she loves it.,She's turning it inside out.,She's looking at the seams. She's looking at the construction.,Her friend says, "Buy it already.",She said, "I'll buy it, but I'm also going to replicate it.",Now, the academics in this audience may think,,"Well, that sounds like plagiarism.",But to a fashionista, what it really is,is a sign of Prada's genius:,that she can root through the history of fashion,and pick the one jacket,that doesn't need to be changed by one iota,,and to be current and to be now. 
 You might also be asking whether it's possible,that this is illegal for her to do this.,Well, it turns out that it's actually not illegal.,In the fashion industry, there's very little,intellectual property protection.,They have trademark protection,,but no copyright protection,and no patent protection to speak of.,All they have, really, is trademark protection,,and so it means that anybody,could copy any garment,on any person in this room,and sell it as their own design.,The only thing that they can't copy,is the actual trademark label,within that piece of apparel.,That's one reason that you see logos,splattered all over these products.,It's because it's a lot harder for knock-off artists,to knock off these designs,because they can't knock off the logo.,But if you go to Santee Alley, yeah.,(Laughter) Well, yeah.,Canal Street, I know.,And sometimes these are fun, right? 
 Now, the reason for this, the reason that the fashion industry,doesn't have any copyright protection,is because the courts decided long ago,that apparel is too utilitarian,to qualify for copyright protection.,They didn't want a handful of designers,owning the seminal building blocks of our clothing.,And then everybody else would have to license this cuff or this sleeve,because Joe Blow owns it.,But too utilitarian? I mean is that the way you think of fashion?,This is Vivienne Westwood. No!,We think of it as maybe too silly,,too unnecessary. 
 Now, those of you who are familiar with the logic,behind copyright protection --,which is that without ownership, there is no incentive to innovate --,might be really surprised,by both the critical success of the fashion industry,and the economic success of this industry.,What I'm going to argue today is that,because there's no copyright protection,in the fashion industry,,fashion designers have actually been able to elevate,utilitarian design,,things to cover our naked bodies,,into something that we consider art.,Because there's no copyright protection,in this industry,,there's a very open and creative,ecology of creativity. 
 Unlike their creative brothers and sisters,,who are sculptors or photographers,or filmmakers or musicians,,fashion designers can sample,from all their peers' designs.,They can take any element from any garment,from the history of fashion,and incorporate it into their own design.,They're also notorious for riffing off of the zeitgeist.,And here, I suspect,,they were influenced by the costumes in Avatar.,Maybe just a little.,Can't copyright a costume either. 
 Now, fashion designers have,the broadest palette imaginable,in this creative industry.,This wedding dress here,is actually made of sporks,,and this dress is actually made of aluminum.,I've heard this dress actually sort of sounds like wind chimes,as they walk through.,So, one of the magical side effects,of having a culture of copying,,which is really what it is,,is the establishment of trends.,People think this is a magical thing. How does it happen?,Well, it's because it's legal for people to copy one another. 
 Some people believe that,there are a few people at the top of the fashion food chain,who sort of dictate to us what we're all going to wear,,but if you talk to any designer at any level,,including these high-end designers,,they always say,their main inspiration comes from the street:,where people like you and me remix and match,our own fashion looks.,And that's where they really get a lot of their,creative inspiration,,so it's both a top-down and a bottom-up kind of industry. 
 Now, the fast fashion giants have,probably benefited the most,from the lack of copyright protection in the fashion industry.,They are notorious for knocking off high-end designs,and selling them at very low prices.,And they've been faced with a lot of lawsuits,,but those lawsuits are usually not won by fashion designers.,The courts have said over and over again, "You don't need,any more intellectual property protection.",When you look at copies like this,,you wonder: How do the luxury high-end brands,remain in business?,If you can get it for 200 bucks, why pay a thousand?,Well, that's one reason we had a conference here at USC a few years ago.,We invited Tom Ford to come --,the conference was called, "Ready to Share:,Fashion and the Ownership of Creativity" --,and we asked him exactly this question.,Here's what he had to say.,He had just come off a successful stint as the lead designer at Gucci,,in case you didn't know. 
 Tom Ford: And we found after much research,that -- actually not much research, quite simple research --,that the counterfeit customer was not our customer. 
 Johanna Blakley: Imagine that.,The people on Santee Alley,are not the ones who shop at Gucci.,(Laughter),This is a very different demographic.,And, you know, a knock-off is never the same,as an original high-end design,,at least in terms of the materials; they're always made of cheaper materials.,But even sometimes a cheaper version,can actually have some charming aspects,,can breathe a little extra life into a dying trend.,There's lots of virtues of copying.,One that a lot of cultural critics have pointed to,is that we now have,a much broader palette,of design choices to choose from than we ever have before,,and this is mainly because of the fast fashion industry, actually.,And this is a good thing. We need lots of options. 
 Fashion, whether you like it or not,,helps you project who you are to the world.,Because of fast fashion,,global trends actually get established much more quickly than they used to.,And this, actually, is good news to trendsetters;,they want trends to be set,so that they can move product.,For fashionistas,,they want to stay ahead of the curve.,They don't want to be wearing what everybody else is wearing.,And so, they want to move on to the next trend,as soon as possible. 
 I tell you, there is no rest for the fashionable.,Every season, these designers have to struggle,to come up with the new fabulous idea that everybody's going to love.,And this, let me tell you,,is very good for the bottom line.,Now of course, there's a bunch of effects,that this culture of copying has,on the creative process.,And Stuart Weitzman is a very successful shoe designer.,He has complained a lot about people copying him,,but in one interview I read,,he said it has really forced him to up his game.,He had to come up with new ideas,,new things that would be hard to copy.,He came up with this Bowden-wedge heel,that has to be made out of steel or titanium;,if you make it from some sort of cheaper material,,it'll actually crack in two.,It forced him to be a little more innovative. (Music) 
 And that actually reminded me,of jazz great, Charlie Parker.,I don't know if you've heard this anecdote, but I have.,He said that one of the reasons he invented bebop,was that he was pretty sure,that white musicians wouldn't be able to replicate the sound. (Laughter),He wanted to make it too difficult to copy,,and that's what fashion designers are doing all the time.,They're trying to put together,a signature look, an aesthetic,that reflects who they are.,When people knock it off, everybody knows,because they've put that look out on the runway,,and it's a coherent aesthetic. 
 I love these Gallianos.,Okay, we'll move on. (Laughter) 
 This is not unlike the world of comedy.,I don't know if you know that jokes,also can't be copyright protected.,So when one-liners were really popular,,everybody stole them from one another.,But now, we have a different kind of comic.,They develop a persona,,a signature style, much like fashion designers.,And their jokes,,much like the fashion designs by a fashion designer,,really only work within that aesthetic.,If somebody steals a joke,from Larry David, for instance,,it's not as funny. 
 Now, the other thing that fashion designers have done,to survive in this culture of copying,is they've learned how to copy themselves.,They knock themselves off.,They make deals with the fast fashion giants,and they come up with a way to sell their product,to a whole new demographic:,the Santee Alley demographic. 
 Now, some fashion designers will say,,"It's only in the United States that we don't have any respect.,In other countries there is protection,for our artful designs.",But if you take a look at the two other biggest markets in the world,,it turns out that the protection that's offered,is really ineffectual.,In Japan, for instance, which I think is the third largest market,,they have a design law; it protects apparel,,but the novelty standard is so high,,you have to prove that your garment has never existed before,,it's totally unique.,And that's sort of like,the novelty standard for a U.S. patent,,which fashion designers never get --,rarely get here in the states. 
 In the European Union, they went in the other direction.,Very low novelty standard,,anybody can register anything.,But even though it's the home of the fast fashion industry,and you have a lot of luxury designers there,,they don't register their garments, generally,,and there's not a lot of litigation.,It turns out it's because the novelty standard is too low.,A person can come in and take somebody else's gown,,cut off three inches from the bottom,,go to the E.U. and register it as a new, original design.,So, that does not stop the knock-off artists.,If you look at the registry, actually,,a lot of the registered things in the E.U.,are Nike T-shirts,that are almost identical to one another. 
 But this has not stopped Diane von Furstenberg.,She is the head of,the Council of Fashion Designers of America,,and she has told her constituency that,she is going to get copyright protection,for fashion designs.,The retailers have kind of quashed this notion though.,I don't think the legislation is going anywhere,,because they realized it is so hard,to tell the difference between a pirated design,and something that's just part of a global trend.,Who owns a look?,That is a very difficult question to answer.,It takes lots of lawyers and lots of court time,,and the retailers decided that would be way too expensive. 
 You know, it's not just the fashion industry,that doesn't have copyright protection.,There's a bunch of other industries that don't have copyright protection,,including the food industry.,You cannot copyright a recipe,because it's a set of instructions, it's fact,,and you cannot copyright the look and feel,of even the most unique dish.,Same with automobiles.,It doesn't matter how wacky they look or how cool they look,,you cannot copyright the sculptural design.,It's a utilitarian article, that's why.,Same with furniture,,it's too utilitarian.,Magic tricks, I think they're instructions, sort of like recipes:,no copyright protection.,Hairdos, no copyright protection.,Open source software, these guys decided,they didn't want copyright protection.,They thought it'd be more innovative without it.,It's really hard to get copyright for databases.,Tattoo artists, they don't want it; it's not cool.,They share their designs.,Jokes, no copyright protection.,Fireworks displays,,the rules of games,,the smell of perfume: no.,And some of these industries may seem,sort of marginal to you,,but these are the gross sales,for low I.P. industries,,industries with very little copyright protection,,and there's the gross sales of,films and books.,(Applause),It ain't pretty. 
 (Applause) 
 So you talk to people in the fashion industry,and they're like, "Shhh!,Don't tell anybody,we can actually steal from each other's designs.,It's embarrassing.",But you know what? It's revolutionary,,and it's a model that a lot of other industries --,like the ones we just saw with the really small bars --,they might have to think about this.,Because right now, those industries with a lot of copyright protection,are operating in an atmosphere,where it's as if they don't have any protection,,and they don't know what to do. 
 When I found out that there are a whole bunch of industries,that didn't have copyright protection,,I thought, "What exactly is the underlying logic?,I want a picture." And the lawyers do not provide a picture,,so I made one.,These are the two main,sort of binary oppositions within the logic of copyright law.,It is more complex than this, but this will do.,First: Is something an artistic object?,Then it deserves protection.,Is it a utilitarian object?,Then no, it does not deserve protection.,This is a difficult, unstable binary. 
 The other one is: Is it an idea?,Is it something that needs to,freely circulate in a free society?,No protection.,Or is it a physically fixed,expression of an idea:,something that somebody made,and they deserve to own it for a while and make money from it?,The problem is that digital technology,has completely subverted the logic,of this physically fixed, expression,versus idea concept.,Nowadays,,we don't really recognize a book,as something that sits on our shelf,or music as something that is,a physical object that we can hold.,It's a digital file.,It is barely tethered to any sort of,physical reality in our minds.,And these things, because we can copy and transmit them so easily,,actually circulate within our culture,a lot more like ideas,than like physically instantiated objects. 
 Now, the conceptual issues are truly profound,when you talk about creativity,and ownership,and, let me tell you, we don't want to leave this just to lawyers to figure out.,They're smart.,I'm with one. He's my boyfriend, he's okay.,He's smart, he's smart.,But you want an interdisciplinary team of people,hashing this out,,trying to figure out: What is the kind of ownership model,,in a digital world,,that's going to lead to the most innovation?,And my suggestion is that,fashion might be a really good place,to start looking for a model,for creative industries in the future. 
 If you want more information about this research project,,please visit our website: it's ReadyToShare.org.,And I really want to thank Veronica Jauriqui,for making this very fashionable presentation. 
 Thank you so much. (Applause)For a moment, what I need to do,is project something on the screen of your imagination.,We're in 17th century Japan,on the west coast,,and a little, wizened monk,is hurrying along, near midnight,,to the crest of a small hill.,He arrives on the small hill,,dripping with water.,He stands there,,and he looks across at the island, Sado.,And he scans across the ocean, and he looks at the sky.,Then he says to himself, very quietly,,"[Turbulent the sea,],[Stretching across to Sado],[The Milky Way].",Basho was a brilliant man.,He said more with less,than any human,that I have ever read or talked to.,Basho, in 17 syllables,,juxtaposed,a turbulent ocean,driven by a storm now past,,and captured the almost,impossible beauty,of our home galaxy,with millions of stars,,probably hundreds and hundreds of -- who knows how many -- planets,,maybe even an ocean,that we will probably call Sylvia in time.,As he was nearing his death,,his disciples and followers,kept asking him,,"What's the secret?,How can you,make haiku poems so beautiful so easily?",And toward the end, he said,,"If you would know the pine tree,,go to the pine tree.",That was it. 
 (Laughter) 
 Sylvia has said we must use,every capacity we have,in order to know the oceans.,If we would know the oceans,,we must go to the oceans.,And what I'd like to talk to you today about, a little bit,,is really transforming,the relationship, or the interplay,,between humans and oceans,with a new capability,that is not at all routine yet.,I hope it will be.,There are a few key points.,One of them is the oceans are central,to the quality of life on earth.,Another is that there are bold, new ways,of studying oceans,that we have not used well yet.,And the last is that these bold, new ways,that we are exploring,as a community,will transform the way we look at our planet, our oceans,,and eventually how we manage,probably the entire planet, for what it's worth.,So what scientists do when they begin,is to start with the system.,They define what the system is.,The system isn't Chesapeake Bay.,It's not the Kuril arc. It's not even the entire Pacific.,It's the whole planet,,the entire planet, continents and oceans together.,That's the system. 
 And basically, our challenge,is to optimize the benefits,and mitigate the risks,of living on a planet that's driven by only two processes,,two sources of energy,,one of which is solar,,that drives the winds, the waves,,the clouds, the storms and photosynthesis.,The second one is internal energy.,And these two war against one another,almost continuously.,Mountain ranges, plate tectonics,,moves the continents around, forms ore deposits.,Volcanoes erupt.,That's the planet that we live on.,It's immensely complex. 
 Now I don't expect all of you to see all the details here,,but what I want you to see is,this is about 10 percent,of the processes that operate within,the oceans almost continuously,,and have for the last 4 billion years.,This is a system that's been around a very long time.,And these have all co-evolved.,What do I mean by that?,They interact with one another constantly.,All of them interact with one another.,So the complexity of this system that we're looking at,,the one driven by the sun --,upper portion, mostly --,and the lower portion is partly driven,by the input from heat below,and by other processes.,This is very, very important,because this is the system, this is the crucible,,out of which life on the planet came,,and it's now time for us to understand it.,We must understand it.,That's one of the themes that Sylvia reminds us about:,understand this ocean of ours,,this basic life support system,,the dominant life support system on the planet. 
 Look at this complexity here.,This is only one variable.,If you can see the complexity,,you can see how,tiny, little eddies,and large eddies and the motion --,this is just sea surface temperature,,but it's immensely complicated.,Now a layer in,,the other two or three hundred processes,that are all interacting,,partly as a function of temperature, partly as a function of all the other factors,,and you've got a really complicated system.,That's our challenge, is to understand,,understand this system in new and phenomenal ways.,And there's an urgency to this.,Part of the urgency comes from the fact,that, of order, a billion people on the planet currently,are undernourished or starving.,And part of the issue,is for Cody --,who's here,,16 years old --,and I have permission to relay this number.,When he, 40 years from now,,is the age of Nancy Brown,,there are going to be,another two and a half billion people on the planet.,We can't solve all the problems,by looking only at the oceans,,but if we don't understand,the fundamental life support system of this planet,much more thoroughly than we do now,,then the stresses that we will face,,and that Cody will face,,and even Nancy, who's going to live till she's 98,,will have really problems coping. 
 All right, let's talk about another perspective,on the importance of the oceans.,Look at this diagram, which is showing,warm waters in red,,cool waters in blue,,and on the continents, what you're seeing in bright green,,is the growth of vegetation,,and in olive green, the dieback of vegetation.,And in the lower left hand corner there's a clock ticking away,from 1982 to 1998,and then cycling again.,What you'll see is that the rhythms,of growth, of vegetation --,a subset of which is food on the continents --,is directly tied to the rhythms,of the sea surface temperatures.,The oceans control,,or at least significantly influence,,correlate with,,the growth patterns and the drought patterns,and the rain patterns on the continents.,So people in Kansas, in a wheat field in Kansas,,need to understand that the oceans,are central to them as well.,Another complexity: this is the age of the oceans.,I'm going to layer in on top of this,the tectonic plates.,The age of the ocean, the tectonic plates,,gives rise to a totally new phenomenon,that we have heard about,in this conference. 
 And I share with you some very high-definition video,that we collected in real time.,Seconds after this video was taken,,people in Beijing,,people in Sydney, people in Amsterdam,,people in Washington D.C. were watching this.,Now you've heard of hydrothermal vents,,but the other discovery,is that deep below the sea floor,,there is vast reservoir of microbial activity,,which we have only just discovered,and we have almost no way to study.,Some people have estimated,that the biomass,tied up in these microbes,living in the pours and the cracks,of the sea floor and below,rival the total amount of living biomass,at the surface of the planet.,It's an astonishing insight,,and we have only found out about this recently.,This is very, very exciting.,It may be the next rainforest,,in terms of pharmaceuticals.,We know little or nothing about it. 
 Well, Marcel Proust has this wonderful saying,that, "The real voyage of discovery,consists not so much in seeking new territory,,but possibly in having new sets of eyes,",new ways of seeing things,,a new mindset.,And many of you remember,the early stages of oceanography,,when we had to use what we had at our fingertips.,And it wasn't easy. It wasn't easy in those days.,Some of you remember this, I'm sure.,And now, we have an entire suite of tools,that are really pretty powerful --,ships, satellites, moorings.,But they don't quite cut it. They don't quite give us what we need. 
 And the program that I wanted to talk to you about,just a little bit here,,was funded, and it involves autonomous vehicles,like the one running across the base of this image.,Modeling: on the right hand side,,there's a very complex computational model.,On the left hand side, there's a new type of mooring,,which I'll show you in just a second.,And on the basis,of several points,,the oceans are complex, and they're central to the life on earth.,They are changing rapidly, but not predictably.,And the models that we need to predict the future,do not have enough data to refine them.,The computational power,is amazing.,But without data, those models,will never ever be predicted.,And that's what we really need.,For a variety of reasons they're dangerous,,but we feel that OOI,,this Ocean Observatory Initiative,,which the National Science Foundation,has begun to fund,,has the potential to really transform things.,And the goal of the program is to,launch an era of scientific discovery,and understanding,across and within the ocean basins,,utilizing widely accessible,,interactive telepresence.,It's a new world. 
 We will be present throughout,the volume of the ocean, at will,,communicating in real time.,And this is what the system involves,,a number of sites in the southern hemisphere,,shown in those circles.,And in the northern hemisphere there are four sites.,I won't talk a lot about most of them right here,,but the one on the west coast, that's in the box,,is called the regional scale nodes.,It was once called Neptune.,And let me show you what's behind it. 
 Fiber: next-generation way of communicating.,You can see the copper tips on these things.,You can transmit power,,but the bandwidth is in those tiny, little threads,smaller than the hair on your head in diameter.,And this particular set here,can transmit something of the order of,three to five terabits per second.,This is phenomenal bandwidth.,And this is what the planet looks like.,We are already laced up,as if we're in a fiber optic corset, if you like.,This is what it looks like.,And the cables go really continent to continent.,It's a very powerful system,,and most of our communications consist of it. 
 So this is the system that I'm talking about,,off the west coast. It's coincident with the tectonic plate,,the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate.,And it's going to deliver abundant power,and unprecedented bandwidth,across this entire volume --,in the overlying ocean,,on the sea floor and below the sea floor.,Bandwidth and power,and a wide variety of processes,that will be operating.,This is what one of those primary nodes looks like,,and it's like a sub station with power and bandwidth,that can spread out over an area the size of Seattle.,And the kind of science that can be done,will be determined by a variety of scientists who want to be involved,and can bring the instrumentation to the table.,They will bring it and link it in.,It'll be, in a sense, like having time on a telescope,,except you'll have your own port.,Climate change, ocean acidification,,dissolved oxygen,,carbon cycle, coastal upwelling,,fishing dynamics --,the full spectrum of,earth science and ocean science,simultaneously in the same volume.,So anyone coming along later,simply accesses the database,and can draw down the information they need,about anything that has taken place.,And this is just the first of these.,In conjunction with our Canadian colleagues, we've set this up. 
 Now I want to take you into the caldera.,On the left hand side there,is a large volcano called Axial Seamount.,And we're going to go down into the Axial Seamount,using animation.,Here's what this system is going to look like,that we are funded to build at this point.,Very powerful.,That's an elevator that's constantly moving up and down,,but it can be controlled by the folks on land,who are responsible for it.,Or they can transfer control,to someone in India or China,who can take over for a while,,because it's all going to be directly connected,through the Internet.,There will be massive amounts of data flowing ashore,,all available to anyone who has any interest in using it.,This is going to be much more powerful,than having a single ship,in a single location,,then move to a new location. 
 We're flying across the caldera floor.,There is a number of robotic systems.,There's cameras that can be turned on and off at your will,,if those are your experiments.,The kinds of systems that will be down there,,the kinds of instruments that will be on the sea floor,,consist of -- if you can read them there --,there's cameras, there's pressure sensors,,fluorometers, there's seismometers.,It's a full spectrum of tools.,Now, that mound right there,actually looks like this.,This is what it actually looks like.,And this is the kind of activity,that we can see with high-definition video,,because the bandwidth of these cables,is so huge,that we could have five to 10,stereo HD systems,running continuously,and, again, directed through robotic techniques from land.,Very, very powerful.,And these are the things that we're funded to do today. 
 So what can we actually do tomorrow?,We're about to ride the wave,of technological opportunity.,There are emerging technologies throughout,the field around oceanography,,which we will incorporate into oceanography,,and through that convergence,,we will transform oceanography into something even more magical.,Robotics systems are just incredible these days,,absolutely incredible.,And we will be bringing robotics of all sorts,into the ocean.,Nanotechnology: this is a small generator.,It's smaller than a postage stamp,,and it can generate power just by being,attached to your shirt as you move.,Just as you move, it generates power.,There are many kinds of things that can be used in the ocean, continuously.,Imaging: Many of you know a good deal more about this type of thing than I,,but stereo imaging at four times the definition,that we have in HD,will be routine within five years. 
 And this is the magic one.,As a result of the human genome process,,we are in a situation where,events that take place in the ocean --,like an erupting volcano, or something of that sort --,can actually be sampled.,We pump the fluid through one of these systems,,and we press the button,,and it's analyzed for the genomic character.,And that's transmitted back to land immediately.,So in the volume of the ocean,,we will know, not just the physics and the chemistry,,but the base of the food chain,will be transparent to us,with data on a continuous basis.,Grid computing: the power of grid computers,is going to be just amazing here.,We will soon be using grid computing,to do pretty much everything, like adjust the data,and everything,that goes with the data.,The power generation will come from the ocean itself.,And the next generation fiber,will be simply magic.,It's far beyond what we currently have.,So the presence of the power,and the bandwidth in the environment,will allow all of these new technologies,to converge in a manner that is just unprecedented. 
 So within five to seven years,,I see us having,a capacity to be completely present,throughout the ocean,and have all of that connected to the Internet,,so we can reach many, many folks.,Delivering the power and the bandwidth into the ocean,will dramatically accelerate adaptation.,Here's an example.,When earthquakes take place, massive amounts,of these new microbes we've never seen before,come out of the sea floor.,We have a way of addressing that,,a new way of addressing that.,We've determined from the earthquake activity that you're seeing here,that the top of that volcano is erupting,,so we deploy the troops.,What are the troops? The troops are the autonomous vehicles, of course.,And they fly into the erupting volcano.,They sample the fluids coming out of the sea floor,during an eruption,,which have the microbes that have never been,to the surface of the planet before.,They eject it to the surface where it floats,,and it is picked up,by an autonomous airplane,,and it's brought back to the laboratory,within 24 hours of the eruption.,This is doable. All the pieces are there. 
 A laboratory: many of you heard what happened,on 9/7.,Some doctors in New York City removed,the gallbladder of a woman in France.,We could do work on the sea floor that would be stunning,,and it would be on live TV,,if we have interesting things to show.,So we can bring an entirely new telepresence,to the world, throughout the ocean.,This -- I've shown you sea floor --,but so the goal here is real time interaction,with the oceans from anywhere on earth.,It's going to be amazing. 
 And as I go here,,I just want to show you what we can bring into classrooms,,and indeed, what we can bring into your pocket.,Many of you don't think of this yet,,but the ocean will be in your pocket.,It won't be long. It won't be long. 
 So let me leave you then,with a few words,from another poet, if you'll forgive me.,In 1943,,T.S. Eliot wrote the "Four Quartets.",He won the Nobel Prize for literature,in 1948.,In "Little Gidding" he says --,speaking I think for the human race,,but certainly for the TED Conference and Sylvia --,"We shall not cease from exploration,,and the end of all our exploring,will be to arrive where we started,and know the place for the first time,,arrive through the unknown remembered gate,where the last of earth left to discover,is that which was the beginning.,At the source of the longest river,the voice of a hidden waterfall,not known because not looked for,,but heard, half heard,in the stillness beneath the waves of the sea." 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Thank you so much. I'm going to try to take you,on a journey of the underwater acoustic world,of whales and dolphins.,Since we are such a visual species,,it's hard for us to really understand this,,so I'll use a mixture of figures and sounds,and hope this can communicate it.,But let's also think, as a visual species,,what it's like when we go snorkeling or diving,and try to look underwater.,We really can't see very far.,Our vision, which works so well in air,,all of a sudden is very restricted and claustrophobic.,And what marine mammals have evolved,over the last tens of millions of years,is ways to depend on sound,to both explore their world,and also to stay in touch with one another. 
 Dolphins and toothed whales use echolocation.,They can produce loud clicks,and listen for echoes from the sea floor in order to orient.,They can listen for echoes from prey,in order to decide where food is,and to decide which one they want to eat.,All marine mammals use sound for communication to stay in touch.,So the large baleen whales,will produce long, beautiful songs,,which are used in reproductive advertisement,for male and females, both to find one another,and to select a mate.,And mother and young and closely bonded animals,use calls to stay in touch with one another,,so sound is really critical for their lives. 
 The first thing that got me interested in the sounds,of these underwater animals,,whose world was so foreign to me,,was evidence from captive dolphins,that captive dolphins could imitate human sounds.,And I mentioned I'll use,some visual representations of sounds.,Here's the first example.,This is a plot of frequency against time --,sort of like musical notation,,where the higher notes are up higher and the lower notes are lower,,and time goes this way.,This is a picture of a trainer's whistle,,a whistle a trainer will blow to tell a dolphin,it's done the right thing and can come get a fish.,It sounds sort of like "tweeeeeet." Like that.,This is a calf in captivity,making an imitation,of that trainer's whistle.,If you hummed this tune to your dog or cat,and it hummed it back to you,,you ought to be pretty surprised.,Very few nonhuman mammals,can imitate sounds.,It's really important for our music and our language. 
 So it's a puzzle: The few other mammal groups that do this,,why do they do it?,A lot of my career has been devoted,to trying to understand,how these animals use their learning,,use the ability to change what you say,based on what you hear,in their own communication systems.,So let's start with calls of a nonhuman primate.,Many mammals have to produce contact calls,when, say, a mother and calf are apart.,This is an example of a call produced by squirrel monkeys,when they're isolated from another one.,And you can see, there's not much,variability in these calls.,By contrast, the signature whistle,which dolphins use to stay in touch,,each individual here has a radically different call.,They can use this ability to learn calls,in order to develop more complicated and more distinctive calls,to identify individuals. 
 How about the setting in which animals need to use this call?,Well let's look at mothers and calves.,In normal life for mother and calf dolphin,,they'll often drift apart or swim apart if Mom is chasing a fish,,and when they separate,they have to get back together again.,What this figure shows is the percentage of the separations,in which dolphins whistle,,against the maximum distance.,So when dolphins are separating by less than 20 meters,,less than half the time they need to use whistles.,Most of the time they can just find each other,just by swimming around.,But all of the time when they separate by more than 100 meters,,they need to use these individually distinctive whistles,to come back together again.,Most of these distinctive signature whistles,are quite stereotyped and stable,through the life of a dolphin.,But there are some exceptions. 
 When a male dolphin leaves Mom,,it will often join up with another male,and form an alliance, which may last for decades.,As these two animals form a social bond,,their distinctive whistles actually converge,and become very similar.,This plot shows two members of a pair.,As you can see at the top here,,they share an up-sweep, like "woop, woop, woop.",They both have that kind of up-sweep.,Whereas these members of a pair go "wo-ot, wo-ot, wo-ot.",And what's happened is,they've used this learning process,to develop a new sign that identifies this new social group.,It's a very interesting way that they can,form a new identifier,for the new social group that they've had. 
 Let's now take a step back,and see what this message can tell us,about protecting dolphins,from human disturbance.,Anybody looking at this picture,will know this dolphin is surrounded,,and clearly his behavior is being disrupted.,This is a bad situation.,But it turns out that when just a single boat,is approaching a group of dolphins,at a couple hundred meters away,,the dolphins will start whistling,,they'll change what they're doing, they'll have a more cohesive group,,wait for the boat to go by,,and then they'll get back to normal business.,Well, in a place like Sarasota, Florida,,the average interval between times,that a boat is passing within a hundred meters of a dolphin group,is six minutes.,So even in the situation that doesn't look as bad as this,,it's still affecting the amount of time these animals have,to do their normal work. 
 And if we look at a very pristine environment like western Australia,,Lars Bider has done work,comparing dolphin behavior and distribution,before there were dolphin-watching boats.,When there was one boat, not much of an impact.,And two boats: When the second boat was added,,what happened was that some of the dolphins,left the area completely.,Of the ones that stayed, their reproductive rate declined.,So it could have a negative impact on the whole population.,When we think of marine-protected areas for animals like dolphins,,this means that we have to be,quite conscious about activities that we thought were benign.,We may need to regulate the intensity,of recreational boating and actual whale watching,in order to prevent these kinds of problems.,I'd also like to point out that sound,doesn't obey boundaries.,So you can draw a line to try to protect an area,,but chemical pollution and noise pollution,will continue to move through the area. 
 And I'd like to switch now from this local,,familiar, coastal environment,to a much broader world of the baleen whales and the open ocean.,This is a kind of map we've all been looking at.,The world is mostly blue.,But I'd also like to point out that the oceans,are much more connected than we think.,Notice how few barriers there are to movement,across all of the oceans compared to land.,To me, the most mind-bending example,of the interconnectedness of the ocean,comes from an acoustic experiment,where oceanographers,took a ship to the southern Indian Ocean,,deployed an underwater loudspeaker,and played back a sound.,That same sound,traveled to the west, and could be heard in Bermuda,,and traveled to the east, and could be heard in Monterey --,the same sound. 
 So we live in a world of satellite communication,,are used to global communication,,but it's still amazing to me.,The ocean has properties,that allow low-frequency sound,to basically move globally.,The acoustic transit time for each of these paths is about three hours.,It's nearly halfway around the globe.,In the early '70s,,Roger Payne and an ocean acoustician,published a theoretical paper,pointing out that it was possible,that sound could transmit over these large areas,,but very few biologists believed it. 
 It actually turns out, though,,even though we've only known of long-range propagation for a few decades,,the whales clearly have evolved,,over tens of millions of years,,a way to exploit this amazing property of the ocean.,So blue whales and fin whales,produce very low-frequency sounds,that can travel over very long ranges.,The top plot here shows,a complicated series of calls,that are repeated by males.,They form songs, and they appear to play a role in reproduction,,sort of like that of song birds.,Down below here, we see calls made by both males and females,that also carry over very long ranges. 
 The biologists continued to be skeptical,of the long-range communication issue,well past the '70s,,until the end of the Cold War.,What happened was, during the Cold War,,the U.S. Navy had a system that was secret at the time,,that they used to track Russian submarines.,It had deep underwater microphones, or hydrophones,,cabled to shore,,all wired back to a central place that could listen,to sounds over the whole North Atlantic.,And after the Berlin Wall fell, the Navy made these systems available,to whale bio-acousticians,to see what they could hear. 
 This is a plot from Christopher Clark,who tracked one individual blue whale,as it passed by Bermuda,,went down to the latitude of Miami and came back again.,It was tracked for 43 days,,swimming 1,700 kilometers,,or more than 1,000 miles.,This shows us both that the calls,are detectable over hundreds of miles,and that whales routinely swim hundreds of miles.,They're ocean-based and scale animals,who are communicating over much longer ranges,than we had anticipated. 
 Unlike fins and blues, which,disperse into the temperate and tropical oceans,,the humpbacked whales congregate,in local traditional breeding grounds,,so they can make a sound that's a little higher in frequency,,broader-band and more complicated.,So you're listening to the complicated song,produced by humpbacks here.,Humpbacks, when they develop,the ability to sing this song,,they're listening to other whales,and modifying what they sing based on what they're hearing,,just like song birds or the dolphin whistles I described.,This means that humpback song,is a form of animal culture,,just like music for humans would be. 
 I think one of the most interesting examples of this,comes from Australia.,Biologists on the east coast of Australia,were recording the songs of humpbacks in that area.,And this orange line here marks the typical songs,of east coast humpbacks.,In '95 they all sang the normal song.,But in '96 they heard a few weird songs,,and it turned out that these strange songs,were typical of west coast whales.,The west coast calls became more and more popular,,until by 1998,,none of the whales sang the east coast song; it was completely gone.,They just sang the cool new west coast song.,It's as if some new hit style,had completely wiped out,the old-fashioned style before,,and with no golden oldies stations.,Nobody sang the old ones. 
 I'd like to briefly just show what the ocean does to these calls.,Now you are listening to a recording made by Chris Clark,,0.2 miles away from a humpback.,You can hear the full frequency range. It's quite loud.,You sound very nearby.,The next recording you're going to hear,was made of the same humpback song,50 miles away.,That's shown down here.,You only hear the low frequencies.,You hear the reverberation,as the sound travels over long-range in the ocean,and is not quite as loud.,Now after I play back these humpback calls,,I'll play blue whale calls, but they have to be sped up,because they're so low in frequency,that you wouldn't be able to hear it otherwise.,Here's a blue whale call at 50 miles,,which was distant for the humpback.,It's loud, clear -- you can hear it very clearly.,Here's the same call recorded from a hydrophone,500 miles away.,There's a lot of noise, which is mostly other whales.,But you can still hear that faint call. 
 Let's now switch and think about,a potential for human impacts.,The most dominant sound that humans put into the ocean,comes from shipping.,This is the sound of a ship,,and I'm having to talk a little louder to talk over it.,Imagine that whale listening from 500 miles.,There's a potential problem that maybe,this kind of shipping noise would prevent whales,from being able to hear each other.,Now this is something that's been known for quite a while. 
 This is a figure from a textbook on underwater sound.,And on the y-axis,is the loudness of average ambient noise in the deep ocean,by frequency.,In the low frequencies, this line indicates,sound that comes from seismic activity of the earth.,Up high, these variable lines,indicate increasing noise in this frequency range,from higher wind and wave.,But right in the middle here where there's a sweet spot,,the noise is dominated by human ships.,Now think about it. This is an amazing thing:,That in this frequency range where whales communicate,,the main source globally, on our planet, for the noise,comes from human ships,,thousands of human ships, distant, far away,,just all aggregating. 
 The next slide will show what the impact this may have,on the range at which whales can communicate.,So here we have the loudness of a call at the whale.,And as we get farther away,,the sound gets fainter and fainter.,Now in the pre-industrial ocean, as we were mentioning,,this whale call could be easily detected.,It's louder than noise,at a range of a thousand kilometers.,Let's now take that additional increase in noise,that we saw comes from shipping.,All of a sudden, the effective range of communication,goes from a thousand kilometers to 10 kilometers.,Now if this signal is used for males and females,to find each other for mating and they're dispersed,,imagine the impact this could have,on the recovery of endangered populations. 
 Whales also have contact calls,like I described for the dolphins.,I'll play the sound of a contact call used,by right whales to stay in touch.,And this is the kind of call that is used by,,say, right whale mothers and calves,as they separate to come back again.,Now imagine -- let's put the ship noise in the picture.,What's a mother to do,if the ship comes by and her calf isn't there?,I'll describe a couple strategies. 
 One strategy is if your call's down here,,and the noise is in this band,,you could shift the frequency of your call out of the noise band,and communicate better.,Susan Parks of Penn State has actually studied this.,She's looked in the Atlantic. Here's data from the South Atlantic.,Here's a typical South Atlantic contact call from the '70s.,Look what happened by 2000 to the average call.,Same thing in the North Atlantic,,in the '50s versus 2000.,Over the last 50 years,,as we've put more noise into the oceans,,these whales have had to shift.,It's as if the whole population had to shift,from being basses to singing as a tenor.,It's an amazing shift, induced by humans,over this large scale,,in both time and space. 
 And we now know that whales can compensate for noise,by calling louder, like I did when that ship was playing,,by waiting for silence,and by shifting their call out of the noise band.,Now there's probably costs to calling louder,or shifting the frequency away from where you want to be,,and there's probably lost opportunities.,If we also have to wait for silence,,they may miss a critical opportunity to communicate.,So we have to be very concerned,about when the noise in habitats,degrades the habitat enough,that the animals either have to pay too much to be able to communicate,,or are not able to perform critical functions.,It's a really important problem. 
 And I'm happy to say that there are several,very promising developments in this area,,looking at the impact of shipping on whales.,In terms of the shipping noise,,the International Maritime Organization of the United Nations,has formed a group whose job is to establish,guidelines for quieting ships,,to tell the industry how you could quiet ships.,And they've already found,that by being more intelligent about better propeller design,,you can reduce that noise by 90 percent.,If you actually insulate and isolate,the machinery of the ship from the hull,,you can reduce that noise by 99 percent.,So at this point, it's primarily an issue of cost and standards.,If this group can establish standards,,and if the shipbuilding industry adopts them for building new ships,,we can now see a gradual decline,in this potential problem. 
 But there's also another problem from ships that I'm illustrating here,,and that's the problem of collision.,This is a whale that just squeaked by,a rapidly moving container ship and avoided collision.,But collision is a serious problem.,Endangered whales are killed every year by ship collision,,and it's very important to try to reduce this.,I'll discuss two very promising approaches.,The first case comes from the Bay of Fundy.,These black lines mark shipping lanes,in and out of the Bay of Fundy.,The colorized area,shows the risk of collision for endangered right whales,because of the ships moving in this lane.,It turns out that this lane here,goes right through a major feeding area of right whales in the summer time,,and it makes an area of a significant risk of collision.,Well, biologists,who couldn't take no for an answer,went to the International Maritime Organization,and petitioned them to say,,"Can't you move that lane? Those are just lines on the ground.,Can't you move them over to a place,where there's less of a risk?",And the International Maritime Organization responded very strongly,,"These are the new lanes.",The shipping lanes have been moved.,And as you can see, the risk of collision is much lower. 
 So it's very promising, actually.,We can be very creative about thinking,of different ways to reduce these risks.,Another action which was just taken independently,by a shipping company itself,was initiated because of concerns the shipping company had,about greenhouse gas emissions with global warming.,The Maersk Line looked at their competition,and saw that everybody who is in shipping thinks time is money.,They rush as fast as they can to get to their port.,But then they often wait there.,What Maersk did is they worked ways to slow down.,They could slow down by about 50 percent.,This reduced their fuel consumption by about 30 percent,,which saved them money,,and at the same time, it had a significant benefit for whales.,It you slow down, you reduce the amount of noise you make,and you reduce the risk of collision. 
 So to conclude, I'd just like to point out,,you know, the whales live in,an amazing acoustic environment.,They've evolved over tens of millions of years,to take advantage of this.,And we need to be very attentive and vigilant,to thinking about where things that we do,may unintentionally prevent them,from being able to achieve their important activities.,At the same time, we need to be really creative,in thinking of solutions to be able to help reduce these problems.,I hope these examples have shown,some of the different directions we can take,in addition to protected areas,to be able to keep the ocean safe for whales to be able to continue to communicate. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)If you really want to understand,the problem that we're facing with the oceans,,you have to think about the biology,at the same time you think about the physics.,We can't solve the problems,unless we start studying the ocean,in a very much more interdisciplinary way.,So I'm going to demonstrate that through,discussion of some of the climate change things that are going on in the ocean.,We'll look at sea level rise.,We'll look at ocean warming.,And then the last thing on the list there, ocean acidification --,if you were to ask me, you know, "What do you worry about the most?,What frightens you?",for me, it's ocean acidification.,And this has come onto the stage pretty recently.,So I will spend a little time at the end. 
 I was in Copenhagen in December,like a number of you in this room.,And I think we all found it, simultaneously,,an eye-opening,and a very frustrating experience.,I sat in this large negotiation hall,,at one point, for three or four hours,,without hearing the word "oceans" one time.,It really wasn't on the radar screen.,The nations that brought it up,when we had the speeches of the national leaders --,it tended to be the leaders of the small island states,,the low-lying island states.,And by this weird quirk,of alphabetical order of the nations,,a lot of the low-lying states,,like Kiribati and Nauru,,they were seated at the very end of these immensely long rows.,You know, they were marginalized,in the negotiation room. 
 One of the problems,is coming up with the right target.,It's not clear what the target should be.,And how can you figure out how to fix something,if you don't have a clear target?,Now, you've heard about "two degrees":,that we should limit temperature rise to no more than two degrees.,But there's not a lot of science behind that number.,We've also talked about,concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.,Should it be 450? Should it be 400?,There's not a lot of science behind that one either.,Most of the science that is behind these numbers,,these potential targets,,is based on studies on land.,And I would say, for the people that work in the ocean,and think about what the targets should be,,we would argue that they must be much lower.,You know, from an oceanic perspective,,450 is way too high.,Now there's compelling evidence,that it really needs to be 350.,We are, right now, at 390 parts per million,of CO2 in the atmosphere.,We're not going to put the brakes on in time to stop at 450,,so we've got to accept we're going to do an overshoot,,and the discussion as we go forward,has to focus on how far the overshoot goes,and what's the pathway back to 350. 
 Now, why is this so complicated?,Why don't we know some of these things a little bit better?,Well, the problem is that,we've got very complicated forces in the climate system.,There's all kinds of natural causes of climate change.,There's air-sea interactions.,Here in Galapagos,,we're affected by El Ninos and La Nina.,But the entire planet warms up when there's a big El Nino.,Volcanoes eject aerosols into the atmosphere.,That changes our climate.,The ocean contains most of the exchangeable heat on the planet.,So anything that influences,how ocean surface waters mix with the deep water,changes the ocean of the planet.,And we know the solar output's not constant through time.,So those are all natural causes of climate change.,And then we have the human-induced causes,of climate change as well.,We're changing the characteristics of the surface of the land,,the reflectivity.,We inject our own aerosols into the atmosphere,,and we have trace gases, and not just carbon dioxide --,it's methane, ozone,,oxides of sulfur and nitrogen. 
 So here's the thing. It sounds like a simple question.,Is CO2 produced by man's activities,causing the planet to warm up?,But to answer that question,,to make a clear attribution to carbon dioxide,,you have to know something about,all of these other agents of change.,But the fact is we do know a lot about all of those things.,You know, thousands of scientists,have been working on understanding,all of these man-made causes,and the natural causes.,And we've got it worked out, and we can say,,"Yes, CO2 is causing the planet to warm up now.",Now, we have many ways to study natural variability.,I'll show you a few examples of this now. 
 This is the ship that I spent the last three months on in the Antarctic.,It's a scientific drilling vessel.,We go out for months at a time and drill into the sea bed,to recover sediments,that tell us stories of climate change, right.,Like one of the ways to understand our greenhouse future,is to drill down in time,to the last period,where we had CO2 double what it is today.,And so that's what we've done with this ship.,This was -- this is south of the Antarctic Circle.,It looks downright tropical there.,One day where we had calm seas and sun,,which was the reason I could get off the ship.,Most of the time it looked like this.,We had a waves up to 50 ft.,and winds averaging,about 40 knots for most of the voyage,and up to 70 or 80 knots. 
 So that trip just ended,,and I can't show you too many results from that right now,,but we'll go back one more year,,to another drilling expedition I've been involved in.,This was led by Ross Powell and Tim Naish.,It's the ANDRILL project.,And we made the very first bore hole,through the largest floating ice shelf on the planet.,This is a crazy thing, this big drill rig wrapped in a blanket,to keep everybody warm,,drilling at temperatures of minus 40.,And we drilled in the Ross Sea.,That's the Ross Sea Ice Shelf on the right there.,So, this huge floating ice shelf,the size of Alaska,comes from West Antarctica.,Now, West Antarctica is the part of the continent,where the ice is grounded on sea floor,as much as 2,000 meters deep.,So that ice sheet is partly floating,,and it's exposed to the ocean, to the ocean heat. 
 This is the part of Antarctica that we worry about.,Because it's partly floating, you can imagine,,is sea level rises a little bit,,the ice lifts off the bed, and then it can break off and float north.,When that ice melts, sea level rises by six meters.,So we drill back in time to see how often that's happened,,and exactly how fast that ice can melt.,Here's the cartoon on the left there.,We drilled through a hundred meters of floating ice shelf,then through 900 meters of water,and then 1,300 meters into the sea floor.,So it's the deepest geological bore hole ever drilled. 
 It took about 10 years to put this project together.,And here's what we found.,Now, there's 40 scientists working on this project,,and people are doing all kinds of really complicated,and expensive analyses.,But it turns out, you know, the thing that told the best story,was this simple visual description.,You know, we saw this in the core samples as they came up.,We saw these alternations,between sediments that look like this --,there's gravel and cobbles in there,and a bunch of sand.,That's the kind of material in the deep sea.,It can only get there if it's carried out by ice.,So we know there's an ice shelf overhead.,And that alternates with a sediment that looks like this.,This is absolutely beautiful stuff.,This sediment is 100 percent made up,of the shells of microscopic plants.,And these plants need sunlight,,so we know when we find that sediment,there's no ice overhead.,And we saw about 35 alternations,between open water and ice-covered water,,between gravels and these plant sediments. 
 So what that means is, what it tells us,is that the Ross Sea region, this ice shelf,,melted back and formed anew,about 35 times.,And this is in the past four million years.,This was completely unexpected.,Nobody imagined that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet,was this dynamic.,In fact, the lore for many years has been,,"The ice formed many tens of millions of years ago,,and it's been there ever since.",And now we know that in our recent past,it melted back and formed again,,and sea level went up and down, six meters at a time. 
 What caused it?,Well, we're pretty sure that it's very small changes,in the amount of sunlight reaching Antarctica,,just caused by natural changes in the orbit of the Earth.,But here's the key thing:,you know, the other thing we found out,is that the ice sheet passed a threshold,,that the planet warmed up enough --,and the number's about one degree to one and a half degrees Centigrade --,the planet warmed up enough that it became ...,that ice sheet became very dynamic,and was very easily melted.,And you know what?,We've actually changed the temperature in the last century,just the right amount.,So many of us are convinced now,that West Antarctica, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, is starting to melt.,We do expect to see a sea-level rise,on the order of one to two meters by the end of this century.,And it could be larger than that.,This is a serious consequence,for nations like Kiribati,,you know, where the average elevation,is about a little over a meter above sea level. 
 Okay, the second story takes place here in Galapagos.,This is a bleached coral,,coral that died during the 1982-'83 El Nino.,This is from Champion Island.,It's about a meter tall Pavona clavus colony.,And it's covered with algae. That's what happens.,When these things die,,immediately, organisms come in,and encrust and live on that dead surface.,And so, when a coral colony is killed,by an El Nino event,,it leaves this indelible record.,You can go then and study corals,and figure out how often do you see this.,So one of the things thought of in the '80s,was to go back and take cores,of coral heads throughout the Galapagos,and find out how often was there a devastating event.,And just so you know, 1982-'83,,that El Nino killed 95 percent,of all the corals here in Galapagos.,Then there was similar mortality in '97-'98.,And what we found,after drilling back in time two to 400 years,was that these were unique events.,We saw no other mass mortality events.,So these events in our recent past really are unique.,So they're either just truly monster El Ninos,,or they're just very strong El Ninos,that occurred against a backdrop of global warming.,Either case, it's bad news,for the corals of the Galapagos Islands. 
 Here's how we sample the corals.,This is actually Easter Island. Look at this monster.,This coral is eight meters tall, right.,And it been growing for about 600 years.,Now, Sylvia Earle turned me on to this exact same coral.,And she was diving here with John Lauret -- I think it was 1994 --,and collected a little nugget and sent it to me.,And we started working on it,,and we figured out we could tell the temperature of the ancient ocean,from analyzing a coral like this.,So we have a diamond drill.,We're not killing the colony; we're taking a small core sample out of the top.,The core comes up as these cylindrical tubes of limestone.,And that material then we take back to the lab and analyze it.,You can see some of the coral cores there on the right. 
 So we've done that all over the Eastern Pacific.,We're starting to do it in the Western Pacific as well.,I'll take you back here to the Galapagos Islands.,And we've been working at this fascinating uplift here in Urbina Bay.,That the place where,,during an earthquake in 1954,,this marine terrace was lifted up,out of the ocean very quickly,,and it was lifted up about six to seven meters.,And so now you can walk through a coral reef without getting wet.,If you go on the ground there, it looks like this,,and this is the grandaddy coral.,It's 11 meters in diameter,,and we know that it started growing,in the year 1584.,Imagine that.,And that coral was growing happily in those shallow waters,,until 1954, when the earthquake happened. 
 Now the reason we know it's 1584,is that these corals have growth bands.,When you cut them, slice those cores in half and x-ray them,,you see these light and dark bands.,Each one of those is a year.,We know these corals grow about a centimeter and a half a year.,And we just count on down to the bottom.,Then their other attribute is,that they have this great chemistry.,We can analyze the carbonate,that makes up the coral,,and there's a whole bunch of things we can do.,But in this case, we measured the different isotopes of oxygen.,Their ratio tells us the water temperature.,In this example here,,we had monitored this reef in Galapagos,with temperature recorders,,so we know the temperature of the water the coral's growing in.,Then after we harvest a coral, we measure this ratio,,and now you can see, those curves match perfectly. 
 In this case, at these islands,,you know, corals,are instrumental-quality recorders of change in the water.,And of course, our thermometers,only take us back 50 years or so here.,The coral can take us back,hundreds and thousands of years.,So, what we do:,we've merged a lot of different data sets.,It's not just my group; there's maybe 30 groups worldwide doing this.,But we get these instrumental- and near-instrumental-quality records,of temperature change that go back hundreds of years,,and we put them together.,Here's a synthetic diagram.,There's a whole family of curves here. 
 But what's happening: we're looking at the last thousand years,of temperature on the planet.,And there's five or six different compilations there,,But each one of those compilations reflects input,from hundreds of these kinds of records from corals.,We do similar things with ice cores.,We work with tree rings.,And that's how we discover,what is truly natural,and how different is the last century, right?,And I chose this one,because it's complicated and messy looking, right.,This is as messy as it gets.,You can see there's some signals there.,Some of the records,show lower temperatures than others.,Some of them show greater variability.,But they all tell us,what the natural variability is.,Some of them are from the northern hemisphere;,some are from the entire globe. 
 But here's what we can say:,what's natural in the last thousand years is that the planet was cooling down.,It was cooling down,until about 1900 or so.,And there is natural variability,caused by the Sun, caused by El Ninos.,A century-scale, decadal-scale variability,,and we know the magnitude;,it's about two-tenths to four-tenths of a degree Centigrade.,But then at the very end is where,we have the instrumental record in black.,And there's the temperature up there in 2009.,You know, we've warmed the globe,about a degree Centigrade in the last century,,and there's nothing,in the natural part of that record,that resembles what we've seen in the last century.,You know, that's the strength of our argument,,that we are doing something that's truly different. 
 So I'll close with a short discussion,of ocean acidification.,I like it as a component of global change to talk about,,because, even if you are a hard-bitten global warming skeptic,,and I talk to that community fairly often,,you cannot deny,the simple physics,of CO2 dissolving in the ocean.,You know, we're pumping out lots of CO2 into the atmosphere,,from fossil fuels, from cement production.,Right now, about a third of that carbon dioxide,is dissolving straight into the sea, right?,And as it does so,,it makes the ocean more acidic.,So, you cannot argue with that.,That is what's happening right now,,and it's a very different issue,than the global warming issue.,It has many consequences. 
 There's consequences for carbonate organisms.,There are many organisms,that build their shells out of calcium carbonate --,plants and animals both.,The main framework material of coral reefs,is calcium carbonate.,That material is more soluble,in acidic fluid.,So one of the things we're seeing,is organisms are having,to spend more metabolic energy,to build and maintain their shells.,At some point, as this transience,,as this CO2 uptake in the ocean continues,,that material's actually going to start to dissolve.,And on coral reefs,,where some of the main framework organisms disappear,,we will see a major loss,of marine biodiversity.,But it's not just the carbonate producers that are affected.,There's many physiological processes,that are influenced by the acidity of the ocean.,So many reactions involving enzymes and proteins,are sensitive to the acid content of the ocean.,So, all of these things --,greater metabolic demands,,reduced reproductive success,,changes in respiration and metabolism.,You know, these are things that we have good physiological reasons,to expect to see stressed,caused by this transience. 
 So we figured out some pretty interesting ways,to track CO2 levels in the atmosphere,,going back millions of years.,We used to do it just with ice cores,,but in this case, we're going back 20 million years.,And we take samples of the sediment,,and it tells us the CO2 level of the ocean,,and therefore the CO2 level of the atmosphere.,And here's the thing:,you have to go back about 15 million years,to find a time when CO2 levels,were about what they are today.,You have to go back about 30 million years,to find a time when CO2 levels,were double what they are today.,Now, what that means is,that all of the organisms that live in the sea,have evolved in this chemostatted ocean,,with CO2 levels lower than they are today.,That's the reason that they're not able to respond or adapt,to this rapid acidification,that's going on right now. 
 So, Charlie Veron,came up with this statement last year:,"The prospect of ocean acidification,may well be the most serious,of all of the predicted outcomes,of anthropogenic CO2 release.",And I think that may very well be true,,so I'll close with this.,You know, we do need the protected areas, absolutely,,but for the sake of the oceans,,we have to cap or limit CO2 emissions,as soon as possible. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I've been fascinated for a lifetime,by the beauty, form and function,of giant bluefin tuna.,Bluefin are warmblooded like us.,They're the largest of the tunas,,the second-largest fish in the sea -- bony fish.,They actually are a fish,that is endothermic --,powers through the ocean with warm muscles like a mammal.,That's one of our bluefin at the Monterey Bay Aquarium.,You can see in its shape and its streamlined design,it's powered for ocean swimming.,It flies through the ocean on its pectoral fins, gets lift,,powers its movements,with a lunate tail.,It's actually got a naked skin for most of its body,,so it reduces friction with the water.,This is what one of nature's finest machines. 
 Now, bluefin,were revered by Man,for all of human history.,For 4,000 years, we fished sustainably for this animal,,and it's evidenced,in the art that we see,from thousands of years ago.,Bluefin are in cave paintings in France.,They're on coins,that date back 3,000 years.,This fish was revered by humankind.,It was fished sustainably,till all of time,,except for our generation.,Bluefin are pursued wherever they go --,there is a gold rush on Earth,,and this is a gold rush for bluefin.,There are traps that fish sustainably,up until recently.,And yet, the type of fishing going on today,,with pens, with enormous stakes,,is really wiping bluefin,ecologically off the planet.,Now bluefin, in general,,goes to one place: Japan.,Some of you may be guilty,of having contributed to the demise of bluefin.,They're delectable muscle,,rich in fat --,absolutely taste delicious.,And that's their problem; we're eating them to death.,Now in the Atlantic, the story is pretty simple.,Bluefin have two populations: one large, one small.,The North American population,is fished at about 2,000 ton.,The European population and North African -- the Eastern bluefin tuna --,is fished at tremendous levels:,50,000 tons over the last decade almost every year. 
 The result is whether you're looking,at the West or the Eastern bluefin population,,there's been tremendous decline on both sides,,as much as 90 percent,if you go back with your baseline,to 1950.,For that, bluefin have been given a status,equivalent to tigers, to lions,,to certain African elephants,and to pandas.,These fish have been proposed,for an endangered species listing in the past two months.,They were voted on and rejected,just two weeks ago,,despite outstanding science,that shows from two committees,this fish meets the criteria of CITES I.,And if it's tunas you don't care about,,perhaps you might be interested,that international long lines and pursing,chase down tunas and bycatch animals,such as leatherbacks, sharks,,marlin, albatross.,These animals and their demise,occurs in the tuna fisheries.,The challenge we face,is that we know very little about tuna,,and everyone in the room knows what it looks like,when an African lion,takes down its prey.,I doubt anyone has seen a giant bluefin feed.,This tuna symbolizes,what's the problem for all of us in the room. 
 It's the 21st century, but we really have only just begun,to really study our oceans in a deep way.,Technology has come of age,that's allowing us to see the Earth from space,and go deep into the seas remotely.,And we've got to use these technologies immediately,to get a better understanding,of how our ocean realm works.,Most of us from the ship -- even I --,look out at the ocean and see this homogeneous sea.,We don't know where the structure is.,We can't tell where are the watering holes,like we can on an African plain.,We can't see the corridors,,and we can't see what it is,that brings together a tuna,,a leatherback and an albatross.,We're only just beginning to understand,how the physical oceanography,and the biological oceanography,come together,to create a seasonal force,that actually causes the upwelling,that might make a hot spot a hope spot.,The reasons these challenges are great,is that technically it's difficult to go to sea.,It's hard to study a bluefin on its turf,,the entire Pacific realm.,It's really tough to get up close and personal with a mako shark,and try to put a tag on it.,And then imagine being Bruce Mate's team from OSU,,getting up close to a blue whale,and fixing a tag on the blue whale that stays,,an engineering challenge,we've yet to really overcome. 
 So the story of our team, a dedicated team,,is fish and chips.,We basically are taking,the same satellite phone parts,,or the same parts that are in your computer, chips.,We're putting them together in unusual ways,,and this is taking us into the ocean realm,like never before.,And for the first time,,we're able to watch the journey of a tuna beneath the ocean,using light and photons,to measure sunrise and sunset.,Now, I've been working with tunas for over 15 years.,I have the privilege of being a partner,with the Monterey Bay Aquarium.,We've actually taken a sliver of the ocean,,put it behind glass,,and we together,have put bluefin tuna and yellowfin tuna on display.,When the veil of bubbles lifts every morning,,we can actually see a community from the Pelagic ocean,,one of the only places on Earth,you can see giant bluefin swim by.,We can see in their beauty of form and function,,their ceaseless activity.,They're flying through their space, ocean space.,And we can bring two million people a year,into contact with this fish,and show them its beauty. 
 Behind the scenes is a working lab at Stanford University,partnered with the Monterey Bay Aquarium.,Here, for over 14 or 15 years,,we've actually brought in,both bluefin and yellowfin in captivity.,We'd been studying these fish,,but first we had to learn how to husbandry them.,What do they like to eat?,What is it that they're happy with?,We go in the tanks with the tuna -- we touch their naked skin --,it's pretty amazing. It feels wonderful.,And then, better yet,,we've got our own version of tuna whisperers,,our own Chuck Farwell, Alex Norton,,who can take a big tuna,and in one motion,,put it into an envelope of water,,so that we can actually work with the tuna,and learn the techniques it takes,to not injure this fish,who never sees a boundary in the open sea.,Jeff and Jason there, are scientists,who are going to take a tuna,and put it in the equivalent of a treadmill, a flume.,And that tuna thinks it's going to Japan, but it's staying in place.,We're actually measuring its oxygen consumption,,its energy consumption.,We're taking this data and building better models.,And when I see that tuna -- this is my favorite view --,I begin to wonder:,how did this fish solve the longitude problem before we did?,So take a look at that animal.,That's the closest you'll probably ever get.,Now, the activities from the lab,have taught us now how to go out in the open ocean. 
 So in a program called Tag-A-Giant,we've actually gone from Ireland to Canada,,from Corsica to Spain.,We've fished with many nations around the world,in an effort to basically,put electronic computers,inside giant tunas.,We've actually tagged 1,100 tunas.,And I'm going to show you three clips,,because I tagged 1,100 tunas.,It's a very hard process, but it's a ballet.,We bring the tuna out, we measure it.,A team of fishers, captains, scientists and technicians,work together to keep this animal out of the ocean,for about four to five minutes.,We put water over its gills, give it oxygen.,And then with a lot of effort, after tagging,,putting in the computer,,making sure the stalk is sticking out so it senses the environment,,we send this fish back into the sea.,And when it goes, we're always happy.,We see a flick of the tail.,And from our data that gets collected,,when that tag comes back,,because a fisher returns it,for a thousand-dollar reward,,we can get tracks beneath the sea,for up to five years now,,on a backboned animal. 
 Now sometimes the tunas are really large,,such as this fish off Nantucket.,But that's about half the size,of the biggest tuna we've ever tagged.,It takes a human effort,,a team effort, to bring the fish in.,In this case, what we're going to do,is put a pop-up satellite archival tag on the tuna.,This tag rides on the tuna,,senses the environment around the tuna,and actually will come off the fish,,detach, float to the surface,and send back to Earth-orbiting satellites,position data estimated by math on the tag,,pressure data and temperature data.,And so what we get then from the pop-up satellite tag,is we get away from having to have a human interaction,to recapture the tag.,Both the electronic tags I'm talking about are expensive.,These tags have been engineered,by a variety of teams in North America.,They are some of our finest instruments,,our new technology in the ocean today.,One community in general,has given more to help us than any other community.,And that's the fisheries off the state of North Carolina.,There are two villages, Harris and Morehead City,,every winter for over a decade,,held a party called Tag-A-Giant,,and together, fishers worked with us,to tag 800 to 900 fish.,In this case, we're actually going to measure the fish.,We're going to do something that in recent years we've started:,take a mucus sample.,Watch how shiny the skin is; you can see my reflection there.,And from that mucus, we can get gene profiles,,we can get information on gender,,checking the pop-up tag one more time,,and then it's out in the ocean.,And this is my favorite. 
 With the help of my former postdoc, Gareth Lawson,,this is a gorgeous picture of a single tuna.,This tuna is actually moving on a numerical ocean.,The warm is the Gulf Stream,,the cold up there in the Gulf of Maine.,That's where the tuna wants to go -- it wants to forage on schools of herring --,but it can't get there. It's too cold.,But then it warms up, and the tuna pops in, gets some fish,,maybe comes back to home base,,goes in again,and then comes back to winter down there in North Carolina,and then on to the Bahamas.,And my favorite scene, three tunas going into the Gulf of Mexico.,Three tunas tagged.,Astronomically, we're calculating positions.,They're coming together. That could be tuna sex --,and there it is.,That is where the tuna spawn.,So from data like this,,we're able now to put the map up,,and in this map,you see thousands of positions,generated by this decade and a half of tagging.,And now we're showing that tunas on the western side,go to the eastern side.,So two populations of tunas --,that is, we have a Gulf population, one that we can tag --,they go to the Gulf of Mexico, I showed you that --,and a second population.,Living amongst our tunas -- our North American tunas --,are European tunas that go back to the Med.,On the hot spots -- the hope spots --,they're mixed populations. 
 And so what we've done with the science,is we're showing the International Commission,,building new models,,showing them that a two-stock no-mixing model --,to this day, used to reject,the CITES treaty --,that model isn't the right model.,This model, a model of overlap,,is the way to move forward.,So we can then predict,where management places should be.,Places like the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean,are places where the single species,,the single population, can be captured.,These become forthright in places we need to protect.,The center of the Atlantic where the mixing is,,I could imagine a policy that lets Canada and America fish,,because they manage their fisheries well,,they're doing a good job.,But in the international realm,,where fishing and overfishing has really gone wild,,these are the places that we have to make hope spots in.,That's the size they have to be to protect the bluefin tuna. 
 Now in a second project,called Tagging of Pacific Pelagics,,we took on the planet as a team,,those of us in the Census of Marine Life.,And, funded primarily through Sloan Foundation and others,,we were able to actually go in, in our project --,we're one of 17 field programs,and begin to take on tagging large numbers of predators,,not just tunas.,So what we've done,is actually gone up to tag salmon shark in Alaska,,met salmon shark on their home territory,,followed them catching salmon,and then went in and figured out,that, if we take a salmon and put it on a line,,we can actually take up a salmon shark --,This is the cousin of the white shark --,and very carefully --,note, I say "very carefully," --,we can actually keep it calm,,put a hose in its mouth, keep it off the deck,and then tag it with a satellite tag.,That satellite tag will now have your shark phone home,and send in a message.,And that shark leaping there, if you look carefully, has an antenna.,It's a free swimming shark with a satellite tag,jumping after salmon,,sending home its data.,Salmon sharks aren't the only sharks we tag.,But there goes salmon sharks with this meter-level resolution,on an ocean of temperature -- warm colors are warmer.,Salmon sharks go down,to the tropics to pup,and come into Monterey. 
 Now right next door in Monterey and up at the Farallones,are a white shark team led by Scott Anderson -- there --,and Sal Jorgensen.,They can throw out a target --,it's a carpet shaped like a seal --,and in will come a white shark, a curious critter,that will come right up to our 16-ft. boat.,It's a several thousand-pound animal.,And we'll wind in the target.,And we'll place an acoustic tag,that says, "OMSHARK 10165,",or something like that, acoustically with a ping.,And then we'll put on a satellite tag,that will give us the long-distance journeys,with the light-based geolocation algorithms,solved on the computer that's on the fish.,So in this case, Sal's looking at two tags there,,and there they are: the white sharks of California,going off to the white shark cafe and coming back.,We also tag makos with our NOAA colleagues,,blue sharks.,And now, together, what we can see,on this ocean of color that's temperature,,we can see ten-day worms of makos and salmon sharks.,We have white sharks and blue sharks.,For the first time,,an ecoscape as large as ocean-scale,,showing where the sharks go. 
 The tuna team from TOPP has done the unthinkable:,three teams tagged 1,700 tunas,,bluefin, yellowfin and albacore,all at the same time --,carefully rehearsed tagging programs,in which we go out, pick up juvenile tunas,,put in the tags that actually have the sensors,,stick out the tuna,and then let them go.,They get returned, and when they get returned,,here on a NASA numerical ocean,you can see bluefin in blue,go across their corridor,,returning to the Western Pacific. 
 Our team from UCSC has tagged elephant seals,with tags that are glued on their heads, that come off when they slough.,These elephant seals cover half an ocean,,take data down to 1,800 feet --,amazing data.,And then there's Scott Shaffer and our shearwaters,wearing tuna tags, light-based tags,,that now are going to take you from New Zealand to Monterey and back,,journeys of 35,000 nautical miles,we had never seen before.,But now with light-based geolocation tags that are very small,,we can actually see these journeys.,Same thing with Laysan albatross,who travel an entire ocean,on a trip sometimes,,up to the same zone the tunas use.,You can see why they might be caught.,Then there's George Schillinger and our leatherback team out of Playa Grande,tagging leatherbacks,that go right past where we are.,And Scott Benson's team,that showed that leatherbacks go from Indonesia,all the way to Monterey.,So what we can see on this moving ocean,is we can finally see where the predators are.,We can actually see how they're using ecospaces,as large as an ocean. 
 And from this information,,we can begin to map the hope spots.,So this is just three years of data right here --,and there's a decade of this data.,We see the pulse and the seasonal activities,that these animals are going on.,So what we're able to do with this information,is boil it down to hot spots,,4,000 deployments,,a huge herculean task,,2,000 tags,in an area, shown here for the first time,,off the California coast,,that appears to be a gathering place.,And then for sort of an encore from these animals,,they're helping us.,They're carrying instruments,that are actually taking data down to 2,000 meters.,They're taking information from our planet,at very critical places like Antarctica and the Poles.,Those are seals from many countries,being released,who are sampling underneath the ice sheets,and giving us temperature data of oceanographic quality,on both poles. 
 This data, when visualized, is captivating to watch.,We still haven't figured out best how to visualize the data.,And then, as these animals swim,and give us the information,that's important to climate issues,,we also think it's critical,to get this information to the public,,to engage the public with this kind of data.,We did this with the Great Turtle Race --,tagged turtles, brought in four million hits.,And now with Google's Oceans,,we can actually put a white shark in that ocean.,And when we do and it swims,,we see this magnificent bathymetry,that the shark knows is there on its path,as it goes from California to Hawaii.,But maybe Mission Blue,can fill in that ocean that we can't see.,We've got the capacity, NASA has the ocean.,We just need to put it together. 
 So in conclusion,,we know where Yellowstone is for North America;,it's off our coast.,We have the technology that's shown us where it is.,What we need to think about perhaps for Mission Blue,is increasing the biologging capacity.,How is it that we can actually,take this type of activity elsewhere?,And then finally -- to basically get the message home --,maybe use live links,from animals such as blue whales and white sharks.,Make killer apps, if you will.,A lot of people are excited,when sharks actually went under the Golden Gate Bridge.,Let's connect the public to this activity right on their iPhone.,That way we do away with a few internet myths. 
 So we can save the bluefin tuna.,We can save the white shark.,We have the science and technology.,Hope is here. Yes we can.,We need just to apply this capacity,further in the oceans. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I would like to share with you this morning,some stories about the ocean,through my work as a still photographer,for National Geographic magazine.,I guess I became an underwater photographer,and a photojournalist,because I fell in love with the sea as a child.,And I wanted to tell stories,about all the amazing things I was seeing underwater,,incredible wildlife and interesting behaviors.,And after even 30 years of doing this,,after 30 years of exploring the ocean,,I never cease to be amazed,at the extraordinary encounters that I have while I'm at sea.,But more and more frequently these days,I'm seeing terrible things underwater as well,,things that I don't think most people realize.,And I've been compelled to turn my camera towards these issues,to tell a more complete story.,I want people to see what's happening underwater,,both the horror and the magic. 
 The first story that I did for National Geographic,,where I recognized the ability to include,environmental issues within a natural history coverage,,was a story I proposed on harp seals.,The story I wanted to do initially,was just a small focus to look at the few weeks each year,where these animals migrate down from the Canadian arctic,to the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada,to engage in courtship, mating and to have their pups.,And all of this is played out against,the backdrop of transient pack ice,that moves with wind and tide.,And because I'm an underwater photographer,,I wanted to do this story from both above and below,,to make pictures like this that show one of these little pups,making its very first swim in the icy 29-degree water.,But as I got more involved in the story,,I realized that there were two big environmental issues I couldn't ignore.,The first was that these animals continue to be hunted,,killed with hakapiks at about eight, 15 days old.,It actually is the largest marine mammal,slaughter on the planet,,with hundreds of thousands of these seals being killed every year. 
 But as disturbing as that is,,I think the bigger problem for harp seals,is the loss of sea ice due to global warming.,This is an aerial picture that I made that shows,the Gulf of St. Lawrence during harp seal season.,And even though we see a lot of ice in this picture,,there's a lot of water as well, which wasn't there historically.,And the ice that is there is quite thin.,The problem is that these pups need a stable platform of solid ice,in order to nurse from their moms.,They only need 12 days from the moment they're born until they're on their own.,But if they don't get 12 days,,they can fall into the ocean and die.,This is a photo that I made showing,one of these pups that's only about five or seven days old --,still has a little bit of the umbilical cord on its belly --,that has fallen in because of the thin ice,,and the mother is frantically trying to push it up to breathe,and to get it back to stable purchase.,This problem has continued to grow each year since I was there.,I read that last year the pup mortality rate,was 100 percent in parts of the Gulf of St. Lawrence.,So, clearly, this species has a lot of problems going forward.,This ended up becoming a cover story at National Geographic.,And it received quite a bit of attention. 
 And with that, I saw the potential to begin,doing other stories about ocean problems.,So I proposed a story on the global fish crisis,,in part because I had personally witnessed,a lot of degradation in the ocean over the last 30 years,,but also because I read a scientific paper,that stated that 90 percent of the big fish in the ocean,have disappeared in the last 50 or 60 years.,These are the tuna, the billfish and the sharks.,When I read that, I was blown away by those numbers.,I thought this was going to be headline news in every media outlet,,but it really wasn't, so I wanted to do a story,that was a very different kind of underwater story.,I wanted it to be more like war photography,,where I was making harder-hitting pictures,that showed readers what was happening,to marine wildlife around the planet. 
 The first component of the story that I thought was essential, however,,was to give readers a sense of appreciation,for the ocean animals that they were eating.,You know, I think people go into a restaurant,,and somebody orders a steak, and we all know where steak comes from,,and somebody orders a chicken, and we know what a chicken is,,but when they're eating bluefin sushi,,do they have any sense of the magnificent animal that they're consuming?,These are the lions and tigers of the sea.,In reality, these animals have no terrestrial counterpart;,they're unique in the world.,These are animals that can practically swim,from the equator to the poles,and can crisscross entire oceans in the course of a year.,If we weren't so efficient at catching them, because they grow their entire life,,would have 30-year-old bluefin out there that weigh a ton.,But the truth is we're way too efficient at catching them,,and their stocks have collapsed worldwide. 
 This is the daily auction at the Tsukiji Fish Market,that I photographed a couple years ago.,And every single day these tuna, bluefin like this,,are stacked up like cordwood,,just warehouse after warehouse.,As I wandered around and made these pictures,,it sort of occurred to me that the ocean's not a grocery store, you know.,We can't keep taking without expecting,serious consequences as a result. 
 I also, with the story, wanted to show readers,how fish are caught, some of the methods that are used to catch fish,,like a bottom trawler, which is one of the most common methods in the world.,This was a small net that was being used in Mexico to catch shrimp,,but the way it works is essentially the same everywhere in the world.,You have a large net in the middle,with two steel doors on either end.,And as this assembly is towed through the water,,the doors meet resistance with the ocean,,and it opens the mouth of the net,,and they place floats at the top and a lead line on the bottom.,And this just drags over the bottom, in this case to catch shrimp.,But as you can imagine, it's catching everything else in its path as well.,And it's destroying that precious benthic community on the bottom,,things like sponges and corals,,that critical habitat for other animals. 
 This photograph I made of the fisherman,holding the shrimp that he caught after towing his nets for one hour.,So he had a handful of shrimp, maybe seven or eight shrimp,,and all those other animals on the deck of the boat are bycatch.,These are animals that died in the process,,but have no commercial value.,So this is the true cost of a shrimp dinner,,maybe seven or eight shrimp,and 10 pounds of other animals that had to die in the process.,And to make that point even more visual, I swam under the shrimp boat,and made this picture of the guy shoveling,this bycatch into the sea as trash,and photographed this cascade of death,,you know, animals like guitarfish, bat rays,,flounder, pufferfish, that only an hour before,,were on the bottom of the ocean, alive,,but now being thrown back as trash. 
 I also wanted to focus on the shark fishing industry,because, currently on planet Earth,,we're killing over 100 million sharks,every single year.,But before I went out to photograph this component,,I sort of wrestled with the notion of how do you make a picture of a dead shark,that will resonate with readers,You know, I think there's still a lot of people out there who think,the only good shark is a dead shark.,But this one morning I jumped in and found this thresher,that had just recently died in the gill net.,And with its huge pectoral fins and eyes still very visible,,it struck me as sort of a crucifixion, if you will.,This ended up being the lead picture,in the global fishery story in National Geographic.,And I hope that it helped readers to take notice,of this problem of 100 million sharks. 
 And because I love sharks -- I'm somewhat obsessed with sharks --,I wanted to do another, more celebratory, story about sharks,,as a way of talking about the need for shark conservation.,So I went to the Bahamas,because there're very few places in the world,where sharks are doing well these days,,but the Bahamas seem to be a place where stocks were reasonably healthy,,largely due to the fact that the government there,had outlawed longlining several years ago.,And I wanted to show several species,that we hadn't shown much in the magazine and worked in a number of locations. 
 One of the locations was this place called Tiger Beach,,in the northern Bahamas where tiger sharks,aggregate in shallow water.,This is a low-altitude photograph that I made,showing our dive boat with about a dozen of these big old tiger sharks,sort of just swimming around behind.,But the one thing I definitely didn't want to do with this coverage,was to continue to portray sharks as something like monsters.,I didn't want them to be overly threatening or scary.,And with this photograph of a beautiful,15-feet, probably 14-feet, I guess,,female tiger shark,,I sort of think I got to that goal,,where she was swimming with these little barjacks off her nose,,and my strobe created a shadow on her face.,And I think it's a gentler picture, a little less threatening,,a little more respectful of the species. 
 I also searched on this story,for the elusive great hammerhead,,an animal that really hadn't been photographed much,until maybe about seven or 10 years ago.,It's a very solitary creature.,But this is an animal that's considered data deficient by science,in both Florida and in the Bahamas.,You know, we know almost nothing about them.,We don't know where they migrate to or from,,where they mate, where they have their pups,,and yet, hammerhead populations in the Atlantic,have declined about 80 percent in the last 20 to 30 years.,You know, we're losing them faster than we can possibly find them. 
 This is the oceanic whitetip shark,,an animal that is considered the fourth most dangerous species,,if you pay attention to such lists.,But it's an animal that's about 98 percent in decline,throughout most of its range.,Because this is a pelagic animal and it lives out in the deeper water,,and because we weren't working on the bottom,,I brought along a shark cage here,,and my friend, shark biologist Wes Pratt is inside the cage.,You'll see that the photographer, of course, was not inside the cage here,,so clearly the biologist is a little smarter than the photographer I guess. 
 And lastly with this story,,I also wanted to focus on baby sharks, shark nurseries.,And I went to the island of Bimini, in the Bahamas,,to work with lemon shark pups.,This is a photo of a lemon shark pup,,and it shows these animals where they live for the first two to three years of their lives,in these protective mangroves.,This is a very sort of un-shark-like photograph.,It's not what you typically might think of as a shark picture.,But, you know, here we see a shark that's maybe 10 or 11 inches long,swimming in about a foot of water.,But this is crucial habitat and it's where they spend the first two, three years of their lives,,until they're big enough to go out on the rest of the reef.,After I left Bimini, I actually learned,that this habitat was being bulldozed,to create a new golf course and resort. 
 And other recent stories have looked at,single, flagship species, if you will,,that are at risk in the ocean,as a way of talking about other threats.,One such story I did documented the leatherback sea turtle.,This is the largest, widest-ranging,,deepest-diving and oldest of all turtle species.,Here we see a female crawling,out of the ocean under moonlight,on the island of Trinidad.,These are animals whose lineage dates back about 100 million years.,And there was a time in their lifespan,where they were coming out of the water to nest,and saw Tyrannosaurus rex running by.,And today, they crawl out and see condominiums.,But despite this amazing longevity,,they're now considered critically endangered.,In the Pacific, where I made this photograph,,their stocks have declined about 90 percent,in the last 15 years. 
 This is a photograph that shows a hatchling,about to taste saltwater for the very first time,beginning this long and perilous journey.,Only one in a thousand,leatherback hatchlings will reach maturity.,But that's due to natural predators,like vultures that pick them off on a beach,or predatory fish that are waiting offshore.,Nature has learned to compensate with that,,and females have multiple clutches of eggs,to overcome those odds.,But what they can't deal with is anthropogenic stresses,,human things, like this picture that shows,a leatherback caught at night in a gill net.,I actually jumped in and photographed this,,and with the fisherman's permission,,I cut the turtle out, and it was able to swim free.,But, you know, thousands of other leatherbacks each year,are not so fortunate,,and the species' future is in great danger. 
 Another charismatic megafauna species that I worked with,is the story I did on the right whale.,And essentially, the story is this with right whales,,that about a million years ago, there was,one species of right whale on the planet,,but as land masses moved around and oceans became isolated,,the species sort of separated,,and today we have essentially two distinct stocks.,We have the Southern right whale that we see here,and the North Atlantic right whale that we see here,with a mom and calf off the coast of Florida.,Now, both species were hunted to the brink of extinction,by the early whalers,,but the Southern right whales have rebounded a lot better,because they're located in places,farther away from human activity. 
 The North Atlantic right whale is listed as,the most endangered species on the planet today,because they are urban whales; they live along the east coast,of North America, United States and Canada,,and they have to deal with all these urban ills.,This photo shows an animal popping its head out at sunset off the coast of Florida.,You can see the coal burning plant in the background.,They have to deal with things like toxins and pharmaceuticals,that are flushed out into the ocean,,and maybe even affecting their reproduction.,They also get entangled in fishing gear.,This is a picture that shows the tail of a right whale.,And those white markings are not natural markings.,These are entanglement scars.,72 percent of the population has such scars,,but most don't shed the gear, things like lobster traps and crab pots.,They hold on to them, and it eventually kills them.,And the other problem is they get hit by ships.,And this was an animal that was struck by a ship,in Nova Scotia, Canada,being towed in, where they did a necropsy,to confirm the cause of death,,which was indeed a ship strike.,So all of these ills are stacking up against these animals,and keeping their numbers very low. 
 And to draw a contrast with that beleaguered North Atlantic population,,I went to a new pristine population of Southern right whales,that had only been discovered about 10 years ago,in the sub-Antarctic of New Zealand, a place called the Auckland Islands.,I went down there in the winter time.,And these are animals that had never seen humans before,,and I was one of the first people they probably had ever seen.,And I got in the water with them,,and I was amazed at how curious they were.,This photograph shows my assistant standing on the bottom at about 70 feet,and one of these amazingly beautiful, 45-foot,,70-ton whales,,like a city bus just swimming up, you know.,They were in perfect condition,,very fat and healthy, robust, no entanglement scars,,the way they're supposed to look.,You know, I read that the pilgrims, when they landed at Plymouth Rock,in Massachusetts in 1620,,wrote that you could walk across Cape Cod Bay,on the backs of right whales.,And we can't go back and see that today,,but maybe we can preserve what we have left. 
 And I wanted to close this program with a story of hope,,a story I did on marine reserves,as sort of a solution,to the problem of overfishing, the global fish crisis story.,I settled on working in the country of New Zealand,because New Zealand was rather progressive,,and is rather progressive in terms of protecting their ocean.,And I really wanted this story to be about three things:,I wanted it to be about abundance,,about diversity and about resilience.,And one of the first places I worked,was a reserve called Goat Island,in Leigh of New Zealand.,What the scientists there told me was that,when protected this first marine reserve in 1975,,they hoped and expected that certain things might happen. 
 For example, they hoped that certain species of fish,like the New Zealand snapper would return,because they had been fished to the brink of commercial extinction.,And they did come back. What they couldn't predict was that other things would happen.,For example, these fish,predate on sea urchins,,and when the fish were all gone,,all anyone ever saw underwater,was just acres and acres of sea urchins.,But when the fish came back,and began predating and controlling the urchin population,,low and behold, kelp forests emerged in shallow water.,And that's because the urchins eat kelp.,So when the fish control the urchin population,,the ocean was restored to its natural equilibrium.,You know, this is probably how the ocean looked here,one or 200 years ago, but nobody was around to tell us. 
 I worked in other parts of New Zealand as well,,in beautiful, fragile, protected areas,like in Fiordland, where this sea pen colony was found.,Little blue cod swimming in for a dash of color.,In the northern part of New Zealand,,I dove in the blue water, where the water's a little warmer,,and photographed animals like this giant sting ray,swimming through an underwater canyon.,Every part of the ecosystem in this place,seems very healthy,,from tiny, little animals like a nudibrank,crawling over encrusting sponge,or a leatherjacket,that is a very important animal in this ecosystem,because it grazes on the bottom and allows new life to take hold. 
 And I wanted to finish with this photograph,,a picture I made on a very stormy day in New Zealand,when I just laid on the bottom,amidst a school of fish swirling around me.,And I was in a place that had only been protected,about 20 years ago.,And I talked to divers that had been diving there for many years,,and they said that the marine life was better here today,than it was in the 1960s.,And that's because it's been protected,,that it has come back. 
 So I think the message is clear.,The ocean is, indeed, resilient and tolerant to a point,,but we must be good custodians.,I became an underwater photographer,because I fell in love with the sea,,and I make pictures of it today because I want to protect it,,and I don't think it's too late. 
 Thank you very much.I'm a visual artist,,and I'm also one of the co-founders of the Plastic Pollution Coalition.,I've been working with plastic bags,,which I cut up and sew back together as my primary material for my artwork,for the last 20 years.,I turn them into two and three-dimensional pieces,and sculptures and installations.,Upon working with the plastic, after about the first eight years,,some of my work started to fissure,and break down into smaller little bits of plastic.,And I thought, "Great.,It's ephemeral just like us." 
 Upon educating myself a little further about plastics,,I actually realized this was a bad thing.,It's a bad thing that plastic breaks down into smaller little bits,,because it's always still plastic.,And what we're finding,is that a lot of it is in the marine environment.,I then, in the last few years,,learned about the Pacific garbage patch and the gyre.,And my initial reaction --,and I think this is a lot of people's first reaction,to learning about it --,is, "Oh my God!,We've got to go out there and clean this thing up.",So I actually developed a proposal,to go out with a cargo ship,and two decommissioned fishing trawlers,,a crane, a chipping machine,and a cold-molding machine.,And my intention was to go out to the gyre,,raise awareness about this issue,and begin to pick up the plastic,,chip it into little bits and cold mold it into bricks,that could potentially be used as building materials,in underdeveloped communities. 
 I began talking with people,who actually had been out to the gyre,and were studying the plastic problem in the marine environment,and upon doing so,,I realized actually that cleaning it up,would be a very small drop in the bucket,relative to how much is being generated,every day around the world,,and that actually I needed to back up and look at the bigger picture.,And the bigger picture is:,we need to find a way to turn off the faucet.,We need to cut the spigot,of single-use and disposable plastics,,which are entering the marine environment every day,on a global scale. 
 So in looking at that, I also realized that I was really angry.,I wasn't just concerned about plastic,that you're trying to imagine out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean --,of which I have learned there are now,11 gyres, potentially, of plastic,in five major oceans in the world.,It's not just that gyre of plastic that I'm concerned about --,it's the gyre of plastic in the supermarket.,I'd go to the supermarket and all of my food is packaged in plastic.,All of my beverages are packaged in plastic,,even at the health food market.,I'm also concerned about the plastic in the refrigerator,,and I'm concerned about the plastic and the toxins that leach from plastic,into us and into our bodies. 
 So I came together with a group of other people,who were all looking at this issue,,and we created the Plastic Pollution Coalition.,We have many initiatives that we're working on,,but some of them are very basic.,One is: if 80 to 90 percent,of what we're finding in the ocean --,of the marine debris that we're finding in the ocean -- is plastic,,then why don't we call it what it is.,It's plastic pollution.,Recycling -- everybody kind of ends their books,about being sustainable and greening with the idea of recycling.,You put something in a bin and you don't have to think about it again.,What is the reality of that?,In the United States, less than seven percent of our plastics are recycled.,And if you really look into it,,particularly when it comes to plastic bottles,,most of it is only down-cycled,,or incinerated, or shipped to China.,It is down-cycled and turned into lesser things,,while a glass bottle can be a glass bottle again,or can be used again --,a plastic bottle can never be a plastic bottle again. 
 So this is a big issue for us.,Another thing that we're looking at and asking people to think about,is we've added a fourth R,onto the front,of the "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle," three R's,,and that is refuse.,Whenever possible, refuse single-use and disposable plastics.,Alternatives exist;,some of them are very old-school.,I myself am now collecting these cool Pyrex containers,and using those instead of Glad and Tupperware containers,to store food in.,And I know that I am doing a service,to myself and my family.,It's very easy to pick up a stainless-steel bottle,or a glass bottle,,if you're traveling and you've forgotten to bring your stainless-steel bottle,and fill that up with water or filtered water,,versus purchasing plastic bottled water. 
 I guess what I want to say to everybody here --,and I know that you guys know a lot about this issue --,is that this is a huge problem in the oceans,,but this is a problem that we've created as consumers,and we can solve.,We can solve this by raising awareness of the issue,and teaching people to choose alternatives.,So whenever possible, to choose alternatives,to single-use plastics.,We can cut the stem -- tide the stem of this,into our oceans,and in doing so,,save our oceans, save our planet, save ourselves. 
 Thank you. (Applause)I guess the story actually has to start,maybe back in the the 1960s,,when I was seven or eight years old,,watching Jacques Cousteau documentaries on the living room floor,with my mask and flippers on.,Then after every episode, I had to go up to the bathtub,and swim around the bathtub and look at the drain,,because that's all there was to look at.,And by the time I turned 16,,I pursued a career in marine science,,in exploration and diving,,and lived in underwater habitats, like this one off the Florida Keys,,for 30 days total.,Brian Skerry took this shot. Thanks, Brian.,And I've dived in deep-sea submersibles around the world.,And this one is the deepest diving submarine in the world,,operated by the Japanese government. 
 And Sylvia Earle and I,were on an expedition in this submarine,20 years ago in Japan.,And on my dive, I went down 18,000 feet,,to an area that I thought,would be pristine wilderness area on the sea floor.,But when I got there, I found,lots of plastic garbage and other debris.,And it was really a turning point in my life,,where I started to realize,that I couldn't just go have fun doing science and exploration.,I needed to put it into a context.,I needed to head towards conservation goals.,So I began to work,with National Geographic Society and others,and led expeditions to Antarctica.,I led three diving expeditions to Antarctica.,Ten years ago was a seminal trip,,where we explored that big iceberg, B-15,,the largest iceberg in history, that broke off the Ross Ice Shelf.,And we developed techniques,to dive inside and under the iceberg,,such as heating pads on our kidneys,with a battery that we dragged around,,so that, as the blood flowed through our kidneys,,it would get a little boost of warmth,before going back into our bodies.,But after three trips to Antarctica,,I decided that it might be nicer to work in warmer water.,And that same year, 10 years ago,,I headed north to the Phoenix Islands. 
 And I'm going to tell you that story here in a moment.,But before I do, I just want you to ponder this graph for a moment.,You may have seen this in other forms,,but the top line is the amount of protected area,on land, globally,,and it's about 12 percent.,And you can see that it kind of hockey sticks up,around the 1960s and '70s,,and it's on kind of a nice trajectory right now.,And that's probably because,that's when everybody got aware of the environment,and Earth Day,and all the stuff that happened in the '60s with the Hippies and everything,really did, I think, have an affect on global awareness.,But the ocean-protected area,is basically flat line,until right about now -- it appears to be ticking up.,And I do believe that we are at the hockey stick point,of the protected area in the ocean.,I think we would have gotten there a lot earlier,if we could see what happens in the ocean,like we can see what happens on land.,But unfortunately, the ocean is opaque,,and we can't see what's going on.,And therefore we're way behind on protection.,But scuba diving, submersibles,and all the work that we're setting about to do here,will help rectify that. 
 So where are the Phoenix Islands?,They were the world's largest marine-protected area,up until last week,when the Chagos Archipelago was declared.,It's in the mid-Pacific. It's about five days from anywhere.,If you want to get to the Phoenix Islands,,it's five days from Fiji,,it's five days from Hawaii, it's five days from Samoa.,It's out in the middle of the Pacific,,right around the Equator.,I had never heard of the islands 10 years ago,,nor the country, Kiribati, that owns them,,till two friends of mine who run a liveaboard dive boat in Fiji,said, "Greg, would you lead a scientific expedition up to these islands?,They've never been dived.",And I said, "Yeah.,But tell me where they are and the country that owns them.",So that's when I first learned of the Islands,and had no idea what I was getting into.,But I was in for the adventure.,Let me give you a little peek here of the Phoenix Islands-protected area.,It's a very deep-water part of our planet.,The average depths are about 12,000 ft.,There's lots of seamounts in the Phoenix Islands,,which are specifically part of the protected area.,Seamounts are important for biodiversity.,There's actually more mountains in the ocean than there are on land.,It's an interesting fact.,And the Phoenix Islands is very rich in those seamounts.,So it's a deep -- think about it in a big three-dimensional space,,very deep three-dimensional space,with herds of tuna, whales,,all kinds of deep sea marine life,like we've seen here before. 
 That's the vessel that we took up there,for these studies, early on,,and that's what the Islands look like -- you can see in the background.,They're very low to the water,,and they're all uninhabited, except one island,has about 35 caretakers on it.,And they've been uninhabited for most of time,because even in the ancient days,,these islands were too far away,from the bright lights of Fiji and Hawaii and Tahiti,for those ancient Polynesian mariners,that were traversing the Pacific so widely.,But we got up there,,and I had the unique and wonderful scientific opportunity and personal opportunity,to get to a place that had never been dived,and just get to an island and go, "Okay, where are we going to dive?,Let's try there,",and then falling into the water.,Both my personal and my professional life changed. 
 Suddenly, I saw a world,that I had never seen before in the ocean --,schools of fish that were so dense,they dulled the penetration of sunlight from the surface,,coral reefs that were continuous,and solid and colorful,,large fish everywhere,,manta rays.,It was an ecosystem. Parrotfish spawning --,this is about 5,000 longnose parrotfish spawning,at the entrance to one of the Phoenix Islands.,You can see the fish are balled up,and then there's a little cloudy area there,where they're exchanging the eggs and sperm for reproduction --,events that the ocean is supposed to do,,but struggles to do in many places now,because of human activity.,The Phoenix Islands and all the equatorial parts of our planet,are very important for tuna fisheries,,especially this yellowfin tuna that you see here.,Phoenix Islands is a major tuna location.,And sharks -- we had sharks on our early dives,,up to 150 sharks at once,,which is an indication,of a very, very healthy, very strong, system. 
 So I thought the scenes,of never-ending wilderness,would go on forever,,but they did finally come to an end.,And we explored the surface of the Islands as well --,very important bird nesting site,,some of the most important bird-nesting sites in the Pacific, in the world.,And we finished our trip.,And that's the area again.,You can see the Islands -- there are eight islands --,that pop out of the water.,The peaks that don't come out of the water are the seamounts.,Remember, a seamount turns into an island when it hits the surface. 
 And what's the context of the Phoenix Islands?,Where do these exist?,Well they exist in the Republic of Kiribati,,and Kiribati is located in the Central Pacific,in three island groups.,In the west we have the Gilbert Islands.,In the center we have the Phoenix Islands,,which is the subject that I'm talking about.,And then over to the east we have the Line Islands.,It's the largest atoll nation in the world.,And they have,about 110,000 people,spread out over 33 islands.,They control 3.4 million cubic miles of ocean,,and that's between one and two percent,of all the ocean water on the planet.,And when I was first going up there,,I barely knew the name of this country 10 years ago,,and people would ask me,,"Why are you going to this place called Kiribati?",And it reminded me of that old joke,where the bank robber comes out of the courthouse handcuffed,,and the reporter yells, "Hey, Willy. Why do you rob banks?",And he says, "cause that's where all the money is.",And I would tell people, "Why do I go to Kiribati?,Because that's where all the ocean is.",They basically are one nation,that controls most of the equatorial waters,of the Central Pacific Ocean. 
 They're also a country,that is in dire danger.,Sea levels are rising,,and Kiribati, along with 42 other nations in the world,,will be under water within 50 to 100 years,due to climate change,and the associated sea-level rise from thermal expansion,and the melting of freshwater into the ocean.,The Islands rise only one to two meters,above the surface.,Some of the islands have already gone under water.,And these nations are faced with a real problem.,We as a world are faced with a problem.,What do we do with displaced fellow Earthlings,who no longer have a home on the planet?,The president of the Maldives,conducted a mock cabinet meeting,underwater recently,to highlight the dire straits of these countries.,So it's something we need to focus on.,But back to the Phoenix Islands,,which is the subject of this Talk. 
 After I got back, I said,,okay, this is amazing, what we found.,I'd like to go back and share it with the government of Kiribati,,who are over in Tarawa,,the westernmost group.,So I started contacting them --,because they had actually given me a permit to do this --,and I said, "I want to come up and tell you what we found.",And for some reason they didn't want me to come,,or it was hard to find a time and a place, and it took a while,,but finally they said, "Okay, you can come.,But if you come, you have to buy lunch,for everybody who comes to the seminar.",So I said, "Okay, I'm happy to buy lunch.,Just get whatever anybody wants.",So David Obura, a coral reef biologist, and I went to Tarawa,,and we presented for two hours,on the amazing findings of the Phoenix Islands.,And the country never knew this. They never had any data from this area.,They'd never had any information from the Phoenix Islands.,After the talk, the Minister of Fisheries walked up to me,and he said, "Greg, do you realize,that you are the first scientist,who has ever come back,and told us what they did?",He said, "We often issue these permits,to do research in our waters,,but usually we get a note two or three years later,,or a reprint.,But you're the first one who's ever come back and told us what you did.,And we really appreciate that. And we're buying you lunch today.,And are you free for dinner?" 
 And I was free for dinner,,and I went out to dinner with the Minister of Fisheries in Kiribati.,And over the course of dinner,,I learned that Kiribati gains most of its revenue --,it's a very poor country --,but it gains what revenue is has,by selling access to foreign nations,to take fish out of its waters,,because Kiribati does not have the capacity,to take the fish itself.,And the deal that they strike,is the extracting country,gives Kiribati five percent,of the landed value.,So if the United States,removes a million dollars',worth of lobsters from a reef,,Kiribati gets 50,000 dollars.,And, you know, it didn't seem like a very good deal to me.,So I asked the Minister over dinner,,I said, "Would you consider a situation,where you would still get paid --,we do the math and figure out what the value of the resource is --,but you leave fish and the sharks,and the shrimp in the water?",He stopped, and he said, "Yes, we would like to do that,to deal with our overfishing problem,,and I think we would call it a reverse fishing license.",He coined the term "reverse fishing license.",So I said, "Yes, a 'reverse fishing license.'" 
 So we walked away from this dinner,really not knowing where to go at that point.,I went back to the States and started looking around,to see if I could find examples,where reverse fishing licenses,had been issued,,and it turned out there were none.,There were no oceanic deals,where countries were compensated for not fishing.,It had occurred on land,,in rainforests of South America and Africa,,where landowners had been paid,not to cut the trees down.,And Conservation International had struck some of those deals.,So I went to Conservation International,and brought them in as a partner,and went through the process,of valuing the fishery resource,,deciding how much Kiribati should be compensated,,what the range of the fishes were,,brought in a whole bunch of other partners --,the government of Australia,,the government of New Zealand, the World Bank.,The Oak Foundation and National Geographic,have been big funders of this as well.,And we basically founded the park,on the idea of an endowment,that would pay the equivalent lost fishing license fees,to this very poor country,to keep the area intact. 
 Halfway through this process, I met the president of Kiribati,,President Anote Tong.,He's a really important leader,,a real visionary, forward-thinking man,,and he told me two things when I approached him.,He said, "Greg, there's two things I'd like you to do.,One is, remember I'm a politician,,so you've got to go out and work with my ministers,and convince the people of Kiribati that this is a good idea.,Secondly, I'd like you to create principles,that will transcend my own presidency.,I don't want to do something like this,if it's going to go away after I'm voted out of office.",So we had very strong leadership, very good vision,and a lot of science, a lot of lawyers involved.,Many, many steps were taken to pull this off.,And it was primarily because Kiribati realized,that this was in their own self-interest to do this.,They realized that this was a common cause,that they had found,with the conservation community. 
 Then in 2002,,when this was all going full-swing,,a coral-bleaching event happened in the Phoenix Islands.,Here's this resource that we're looking to save,,and it turns out it's the hottest heating event,that we can find on record.,The ocean heated up as it does sometimes,,and the hot spot formed and stalled,right over the Phoenix Islands for six months.,It was over 32 degrees Celsius for six months,and it basically killed,60 percent of the coral.,So suddenly we had this area that we were protecting,,but now it appeared to be dead, at least in the coral areas.,Of course the deep-sea areas and the open ocean areas were fine,,but the coral, which everybody likes to look at, was in trouble.,Well, the good news is it's recovered,and recovering fast,,faster than any reef we've seen.,This picture was just taken by Brian Skerry a few months ago,when we returned to the Phoenix Islands,and discovered that, because it is a protected area,and has healthy fish populations,that keep the algae grazed down,and keep the rest of the reef healthy,,the coral is booming, is just booming back.,It's almost like if a person,has multiple diseases,,it's hard to get well, you might die,,but if you only have one disease to deal with, you can get better.,And that's the story with climate-change heating.,It's the only threat,,the only influence that the reef had to deal with.,There was no fishing, there was no pollution, there was no coastal development,,and the reef is on a full-bore recovery. 
 Now I remember that dinner I had with the Minister of Fisheries 10 years ago,when we first brought this up and I got quite animated during the dinner,and said, "Well, I think that the conservation community,might embrace this idea, Minister.",He paused and put his hands together and said,,"Yes, Greg,,but the devil will be in the details," he said.,And it certainly was.,The last 10 years have been detail after detail,ranging from creating legislation,to multiple research expeditions,to communication plans,,as I said, teams of lawyers,,MOUs,,creating the Phoenix Islands Trust Board.,And we are now in the process of raising the full endowment.,Kiribati has frozen extracting activities,at its current state while we raise the endowment.,We just had our first PIPA Trust Board meeting three weeks ago.,So it's a fully functional,up-and-running entity,that negotiates the reverse fishing license with the country.,And the PIPA Trust Board holds that license,and pays the country for this.,So it's a very solid, very well thought-out,,very well grounded system,,and it was a bottom-up system,,and that was very important with this work,,from the bottom up to secure this.,So the conditions for success here are listed.,You can read them yourselves.,But I would say the most important one in my mind,was working within the market forces,of the situation.,And that insured that we could move this forward,and it would have both the self-interest of Kiribati,as well as the self-interest of the world. 
 And I'll leave you with one final slide,,that is: how do we scale this up?,How do we realize Sylvia's dream?,Where eventually do we take this?,Here's the Pacific,with large MPAs,and large conservation zones on it.,And as you can see,,we have a patchwork across this ocean.,I've just described to you the one story,behind that rectangular area in the middle, the Phoenix Islands,,but every other green patch on that,has its own story.,And what we need to do now,is look at the whole Pacific Ocean,in its entirety,and make a network of MPAs,across the Pacific,so that we have our world's largest ocean,protected and self-sustaining,over time. 
 Thank you very much. (Applause)Today I'm going to take you on a voyage,to some place so deep,,so dark, so unexplored,that we know less about it than we know about the dark side of the moon.,It's a place of myth and legend.,It's a place marked on ancient maps,as "here be monsters.",It is a place where each new voyage of exploration,brings back new discoveries of creatures so wondrous and strange,that our forefathers would have considered them monstrous indeed.,Instead, they just make me green with envy,that my colleague from IUCN,was able to go on this journey to the south of Madagascar seamounts,to actually take photographs,and to see these wondrous creatures of the deep. 
 We are talking about the high seas.,The "high seas" is a legal term,,but in fact, it covers 50 percent of the planet.,With an average depth of the oceans,of 4,000 meters,,in fact, the high seas covers and provides,nearly 90 percent of the habitat,for life on this Earth.,It is, in theory, the global commons,,belonging to us all.,But in reality,,it is managed by and for,those who have the resources,to go out and exploit it.,So today I'm going to take you on a voyage,to cast light on some of the outdated myths,and legends and assumptions,that have kept us as the true stakeholders,in the high seas in the dark.,We're going to voyage to some of these special places,that we've been discovering in the past few years,to show why we really need to care.,And then finally, we're going to try,to develop and pioneer a new perspective,on high seas governance,that's rooted in ocean-basin-wide conservation,,but framed in an arena of global norms,of precaution and respect. 
 So here is a picture of the high seas,as seen from above --,that area in the darker blue.,To me, as an international lawyer,,this scared me far more,than any of the creatures or the monsters we may have seen,,for it belies the notion that you can actually protect the ocean,,the global ocean,,that provides us all with carbon storage,,with heat storage, with oxygen,,if you can only protect 36 percent.,This is indeed the true heart of the planet.,Some of the problems that we have to confront,are that the current international laws --,for example, shipping --,provide more protection,to the areas closest to shore.,For example, garbage discharge,,something you would think just simply goes away,,but the laws regulating,ship discharge of garbage,actually get weaker the further you are from shore.,As a result, we have garbage patches,the size of twice-Texas.,It's unbelievable.,We used to think the solution to pollution,was dilution,,but that has proved to be no longer the case. 
 So what we have learned from social scientists,and economists like Elinor Ostrom,,who are studying the phenomenon,of management of the commons on a local scale,,is that there are certain prerequisites,that you can put into place,that enable you to manage,and access open space,for the good of one and all.,And these include a sense of shared responsibility,,common norms that bind people together as a community.,Conditional access: You can invite people in,,but they have to be able to play by the rules.,And of course, if you want people to play by the rules,,you still need an effective system,of monitoring and enforcement,,for as we've discovered,,you can trust, but you also need to verify. 
 What I'd also like to convey,is that it is not all doom and gloom,that we are seeing in the high seas.,For a group of very dedicated individuals --,scientists, conservationists,,photographers and states --,were able to actually change a tragic trajectory,that was destroying fragile seascapes,such as this coral garden,that you see in front of you.,That is, we're able to save it from a fate,of deep-sea bottom trawling.,And how did we do that?,Well, as I said, we had a group of photographers that went out on board ships,and actually photographed the activities in process.,But we also spent many hours,in the basements of the United Nations,,trying to work with governments to make them understand,what was going on so far away from land,that few of us had ever even imagined,that these creatures existed. 
 So within three years,,from 2003 to 2006,,we were able to get norm in place,that actually changed the paradigm,of how fishers went about,deep-sea bottom trawling.,Instead of "go anywhere, do anything you want,",we actually created a regime,that required prior assessment of where you're going,and a duty to prevent significant harm.,In 2009, when the U.N. reviewed progress,,they discovered,that almost 100 million square-kilometers of seabed,had been protected.,This does not mean that it's the final solution,,or that this even provides permanent protection.,But what it does mean,is that a group of individuals can form a community,to actually shape,the way high seas are governed,,to create a new regime.,So I'm looking optimistically at our opportunities,for creating a true, blue perspective,for this beautiful planet.,Sylvia's wish,provides us with that leverage, that access,to the heart of human beings,,you might say,,who have rarely seen places beyond their own toes,,but are now hopefully going to become interested,in the full life-cycle of creatures like these sea turtles,,who indeed spend most of their time in the high seas. 
 Today, we're just going to voyage to a small sampling,of some of these special areas,,just to give you an idea of the flavor,of the riches and wonders they do contain.,The Sargasso Sea, for example,,is not a sea bounded by coastlines,,but it is bounded by oceanic currents,that contain and envelope,this wealth of sargassum,that grows and aggregates there.,It's also known as the spawning ground for eels,from Northern European,and Northern American rivers,that are now so dwindling in numbers,that they've actually stopped showing up in Stockholm,,and five showed up in the U.K. just recently. 
 But the Sargasso Sea,,the same way it aggregates sargassum weed,,actually is pulling in the plastic,from throughout the region.,This picture doesn't exactly show,the plastics that I would like it to show, because I haven't been out there myself.,But there has just been a study,that was released in February,that showed there are 200,000,pieces of plastic per square-kilometer,now floating in the surface of the Sargasso Sea,,and that is affecting the habitat,for the many species in their juvenile stages,who come to the Sargasso Sea,for its protection and its food.,The Sargasso Sea is also a wondrous place,for the aggregation of these unique species,that have developed to mimic the sargassum habitat.,It also provides a special habitat,for these flying fish to lay their eggs.,But what I'd like to get from this picture,is that we truly do have an opportunity,to launch a global initiative for protection.,Thus, the government of Bermuda has recognized the need,and its responsibility,as having some of the Sargasso Sea,within its national jurisdiction --,but the vast majority is beyond --,to help spearhead a movement,to achieve protection for this vital area. 
 Spinning down to someplace a little bit cooler than here right now:,the Ross Sea in the Southern Ocean.,It's actually a bay.,It's considered high seas, because the continent,has been put off limits,to territorial claims.,So anything in the water is treated as if it's the high seas.,But what makes the Ross Sea important,is the vast sea of pack ice,that in the spring and summer,provides a wealth of phytoplankton and krill,that supports what, till recently,,has been a virtually intact,near-shore ecosystem.,But unfortunately, CCAMLR,,the regional commission,in charge of conserving and managing fish stocks,and other living marine resources,,is unfortunately starting to give in to fishing interests,and has authorized the expansion,of toothfish fisheries in the region.,The captain of a New Zealand vessel,who was just down there,is reporting a significant decline,in the number of the Ross Sea killer whales,,who are directly dependent on the Antarctic toothfish,as their main source of food.,So what we need to do is to stand up boldly,,singly and together,,to push governments,,to push regional fisheries management organizations,,to declare our right,to declare certain areas off-limits to high seas fishing,,so that the freedom to fish no longer means,the freedom to fish anywhere and anytime. 
 Coming closer to here, the Costa Rica Dome,is a recently discovered area --,potentially year-round habitat for blue whales.,There's enough food there to last them,the summer and the winter long.,But what's unusual about the Costa Rica Dome,is, in fact, it's not a permanent place.,It's an oceanographic phenomenon,that shifts in time and space on a seasonal basis.,So, in fact, it's not permanently in the high seas.,It's not permanently in the exclusive economic zones,of these five Central American countries,,but it moves with the season.,As such, it does create a challenge to protect,,but we also have a challenge protecting the species that move along with it.,We can use the same technologies that fishers use,to identify where the species are,,in order to close the area,when it's most vulnerable,,which may, in some cases, be year-round. 
 Getting closer to shore, where we are,,this was in fact taken in the Galapagos.,Many species are headed through this region,,which is why there's been so much attention,put into conservation,of the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape.,This is the initiative that's been coordinated,by Conservation International,with a variety of partners and governments,to actually try to bring integrated management regime,throughout the area.,That is, it provides a wonderful example of where you can go,with a real regional initiative.,It's protecting five World Heritage sites.,Unfortunately, the World Heritage Convention,does not recognize the need to protect areas,beyond national jurisdiction, at present.,So a place like the Costa Rica Dome,could not technically qualify,the time it's in the high seas.,So what we've been suggesting,is that we either need to amend the World Heritage Convention,,so that it can adopt,and urge universal protection of these World Heritage sites,,or we need to change the name,and call it Half-the-World Heritage Convention.,But what we also know is that species like these sea turtles,do not stay put in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape.,These happen to go down to a vast South Pacific Gyre,,where they spend most of their time,and often end up getting hooked like this,,or as bycatch. 
 So what I'd really like to suggest is that we need to scale-up.,We need to work locally,,but we also need to work ocean-basin-wide.,We have the tools and technologies now,to enable us to take a broader,ocean-basin-wide initiative.,We've heard about the Tagging of Pacific Predators project,,one of the 17 Census of Marine Life projects.,It's provided us data like this,,of tiny, little sooty shearwaters,that make the entire ocean basin their home.,They fly 65,000 kilometers,in less than a year.,So we have the tools and treasures coming from the Census of Marine Life.,And its culminating year,that's going to be launched in October.,So stay tuned for further information.,What I find so exciting,is that the Census of Marine Life,has looked at more than the tagging of pacific predators;,it's also looked in the really unexplored mid-water column,,where creatures like this flying sea cucumber,have been found.,And fortunately, we've been able, as IUCN,,to team up with the Census of Marine Life,and many of the scientists working there,to actually try to translate,much of this information to policymakers.,We have the support of governments now behind us.,We've been revealing this information through technical workshops.,And the exciting thing is that we do have sufficient information,to move ahead to protect some of these,significant hope spots, hotspots.,At the same time we're saying,,"Yes, we need more. We need to move forward." 
 But many of you have said,,if you get these marine protected areas,,or a reasonable regime for high seas fisheries management in place,,how are you going to enforce it?,Which leads me to my second passion besides ocean science,,which is outer space technology.,I wanted to be an astronaut,,so I've constantly followed,what are the tools available to monitor Earth,from outer space --,and that we have incredible tools like we've been learning about,,in terms of being able to follow tagged species,throughout their life-cycles,in the open ocean.,We can also tag and track fishing vessels.,Many already have transponders on board,that allow us to find out where they are and even what they're doing.,But not all the vessels have those to date.,It does not take too much rocket science,to actually try to create new laws to mandate,,if you're going to have the privilege,of accessing our high seas resources,,we need to know -- someone needs to know --,where you are and what you're doing. 
 So it brings me to my main take-home message,,which is we can avert a tragedy of the commons.,We can stop the collision course,of 50 percent of the planet,with the high seas.,But we need to think broad-scale. We need to think globally.,We need to change how we actually go about,managing these resources.,We need to get the new paradigm,of precaution and respect.,At the same time, we need to think locally,,which is the joy and marvel of Sylvia's hope spot wish,,is that we can shine a spotlight,on many of these previously unknown areas,,and to bring people to the table, if you will,,to actually make them feel part of this community,that truly has a stake,in their future management.,And third is that we need to look at ocean-basin-wide management.,Our species are ocean-basin-wide.,Many of the deep-sea communities,have genetic distribution,that goes ocean-basin-wide.,We need to better understand,,but we also need to start to manage and protect.,And in order to do that,,you also need ocean-basin management regimes.,That is, we have regional management regimes,within the exclusive economic zone,,but we need to scale these up, we need to build their capacity,,so they're like the Southern Ocean,,where they do have the two-pronged fisheries,and conservation organization. 
 So with that, I would just like to sincerely thank and honor,Sylvia Earle for her wish,,for it is helping us to put a face on the high seas,and the deep seas beyond national jurisdiction.,It's helping to bring an incredible group,of talented people together,to really try to solve and penetrate,these problems that have created our obstacles,to management and rational use,of this area that was once so far away and remote. 
 So on this tour, I hope I provided you,with a new perspective of the high seas:,one, that it is our home too,,and that we need to work together,if we are to make this a sustainable ocean future for us all. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)We live in difficult and challenging,economic times, of course.,And one of the first victims,of difficult economic times,,I think, is public spending of any kind,,but certainly in the firing line at the moment,is public spending for science,,and particularly curiosity-led science,and exploration.,So I want to try and convince you in about 15 minutes,that that's a ridiculous,and ludicrous thing to do. 
 But I think to set the scene,,I want to show -- the next slide is not my attempt,to show the worst TED slide in the history of TED,,but it is a bit of a mess.,(Laughter),But actually, it's not my fault; it's from the Guardian newspaper.,And it's actually a beautiful demonstration,of how much science costs.,Because, if I'm going to make the case,for continuing to spend on curiosity-driven science and exploration,,I should tell you how much it costs.,So this is a game called "spot the science budgets.",This is the U.K. government spend.,You see there, it's about 620 billion a year. 
 The science budget is actually --,if you look to your left, there's a purple set of blobs,and then yellow set of blobs.,And it's one of the yellow set of blobs,around the big yellow blob.,It's about 3.3 billion pounds per year,out of 620 billion.,That funds everything in the U.K.,from medical research, space exploration,,where I work, at CERN in Geneva, particle physics,,engineering, even arts and humanities,,funded from the science budget,,which is that 3.3 billion, that little, tiny yellow blob,around the orange blob at the top left of the screen.,So that's what we're arguing about.,That percentage, by the way, is about the same,in the U.S. and Germany and France.,R&D in total in the economy,,publicly funded, is about,0.6 percent of GDP.,So that's what we're arguing about. 
 The first thing I want to say,,and this is straight from "Wonders of the Solar System,",is that our exploration of the solar system and the universe,has shown us that it is indescribably beautiful.,This is a picture that actually was sent back,by the Cassini space probe around Saturn,,after we'd finished filming "Wonders of the Solar System.",So it isn't in the series.,It's of the moon Enceladus.,So that big sweeping, white,sphere in the corner is Saturn,,which is actually in the background of the picture.,And that crescent there is the moon Enceladus,,which is about as big as the British Isles.,It's about 500 kilometers in diameter.,So, tiny moon.,What's fascinating and beautiful ...,this an unprocessed picture, by the way, I should say,,it's black and white, straight from Saturnian orbit. 
 What's beautiful is, you can probably see on the limb there,some faint, sort of,,wisps of almost smoke,rising up from the limb.,This is how we visualize that in "Wonders of the Solar System.",It's a beautiful graphic.,What we found out were that those faint wisps,are actually fountains of ice,rising up from the surface of this tiny moon.,That's fascinating and beautiful in itself,,but we think that the mechanism,for powering those fountains,requires there to be lakes of liquid water,beneath the surface of this moon.,And what's important about that,is that, on our planet, on Earth,,wherever we find liquid water,,we find life.,So, to find strong evidence,of liquid, pools of liquid, beneath the surface of a moon,750 million miles away from the Earth,is really quite astounding.,So what we're saying, essentially,,is maybe that's a habitat for life in the solar system.,Well, let me just say, that was a graphic. I just want to show this picture.,That's one more picture of Enceladus.,This is when Cassini flew beneath Enceladus.,So it made a very low pass,,just a few hundred kilometers above the surface.,And so this, again, a real picture of the ice fountains rising up into space,,absolutely beautiful. 
 But that's not the prime candidate for life in the solar system.,That's probably this place,,which is a moon of Jupiter, Europa.,And again, we had to fly to the Jovian system,to get any sense that this moon, as most moons,,was anything other than a dead ball of rock.,It's actually an ice moon.,So what you're looking at is the surface of the moon Europa,,which is a thick sheet of ice, probably a hundred kilometers thick.,But by measuring the way that,Europa interacts,with the magnetic field of Jupiter,,and looking at how those cracks in the ice,that you can see there on that graphic move around,,we've inferred very strongly,that there's an ocean of liquid surrounding,the entire surface of Europa.,So below the ice, there's an ocean of liquid around the whole moon.,It could be hundreds of kilometers deep, we think.,We think it's saltwater, and that would mean that,there's more water on that moon of Jupiter,than there is in all the oceans of the Earth combined.,So that place, a little moon around Jupiter,,is probably the prime candidate,for finding life on a moon,or a body outside the Earth, that we know of.,Tremendous and beautiful discovery. 
 Our exploration of the solar system,has taught us that the solar system is beautiful.,It may also have pointed the way to answering,one of the most profound questions that you can possibly ask,,which is: "Are we alone in the universe?",Is there any other use to exploration and science,,other than just a sense of wonder?,Well, there is.,This is a very famous picture,taken, actually, on my first Christmas Eve,,December 24th, 1968,,when I was about eight months old.,It was taken by Apollo 8,as it went around the back of the moon.,Earthrise from Apollo 8.,A famous picture; many people have said that it's the picture,that saved 1968,,which was a turbulent year --,the student riots in Paris,,the height of the Vietnam War.,The reason many people think that about this picture,,and Al Gore has said it many times, actually, on the stage at TED,,is that this picture, arguably, was,the beginning of the environmental movement.,Because, for the first time,,we saw our world,,not as a solid, immovable,,kind of indestructible place,,but as a very small, fragile-looking world,just hanging against the blackness of space. 
 What's also not often said,about the space exploration, about the Apollo program,,is the economic contribution it made.,I mean while you can make arguments that it was wonderful,and a tremendous achievement,and delivered pictures like this,,it cost a lot, didn't it?,Well, actually, many studies have been done,about the economic effectiveness,,the economic impact of Apollo.,The biggest one was in 1975 by Chase Econometrics.,And it showed that for every $1 spent on Apollo,,14 came back into the U.S. economy.,So the Apollo program paid for itself,in inspiration,,in engineering, achievement,and, I think, in inspiring young scientists and engineers,14 times over.,So exploration can pay for itself. 
 What about scientific discovery?,What about driving innovation?,Well, this looks like a picture of virtually nothing.,What it is, is a picture of the spectrum,of hydrogen.,See, back in the 1880s, 1890s,,many scientists, many observers,,looked at the light given off from atoms.,And they saw strange pictures like this.,What you're seeing when you put it through a prism,is that you heat hydrogen up and it doesn't just glow,like a white light,,it just emits light at particular colors,,a red one, a light blue one, some dark blue ones.,Now that led to an understanding of atomic structure,because the way that's explained,is atoms are a single nucleus,with electrons going around them.,And the electrons can only be in particular places.,And when they jump up to the next place they can be,,and fall back down again,,they emit light at particular colors. 
 And so the fact that atoms, when you heat them up,,only emit light at very specific colors,,was one of the key drivers,that led to the development of the quantum theory,,the theory of the structure of atoms.,I just wanted to show this picture because this is remarkable.,This is actually a picture of the spectrum of the Sun.,And now, this is a picture of atoms in the Sun's atmosphere,absorbing light.,And again, they only absorb light at particular colors,when electrons jump up and fall down,,jump up and fall down.,But look at the number of black lines in that spectrum.,And the element helium,was discovered just by staring at the light from the Sun,because some of those black lines were found,that corresponded to no known element.,And that's why helium's called helium.,It's called "helios" -- helios from the Sun. 
 Now, that sounds esoteric,,and indeed it was an esoteric pursuit,,but the quantum theory quickly led,to an understanding of the behaviors of electrons in materials,like silicon, for example.,The way that silicon behaves,,the fact that you can build transistors,,is a purely quantum phenomenon.,So without that curiosity-driven,understanding of the structure of atoms,,which led to this rather esoteric theory, quantum mechanics,,then we wouldn't have transistors, we wouldn't have silicon chips,,we wouldn't have pretty much the basis,of our modern economy. 
 There's one more, I think, wonderful twist to that tale.,In "Wonders of the Solar System,",we kept emphasizing the laws of physics are universal.,It's one of the most incredible things about the physics,and the understanding of nature that you get on Earth,,is you can transport it, not only to the planets,,but to the most distant stars and galaxies.,And one of the astonishing predictions,of quantum mechanics,,just by looking at the structure of atoms --,the same theory that describes transistors --,is that there can be no stars in the universe,that have reached the end of their life,that are bigger than, quite specifically, 1.4 times the mass of the Sun.,That's a limit imposed on the mass of stars.,You can work it out on a piece of paper in a laboratory,,get a telescope, swing it to the sky,,and you find that there are no dead stars,bigger than 1.4 times the mass of the Sun.,That's quite an incredible prediction. 
 What happens when you have a star that's right on the edge of that mass?,Well, this is a picture of it.,This is the picture of a galaxy, a common "our garden" galaxy,with, what, 100 billion,stars like our Sun in it.,It's just one of billions of galaxies in the universe.,There are a billion stars in the galactic core,,which is why it's shining out so brightly.,This is about 50 million light years away,,so one of our neighboring galaxies.,But that bright star there,is actually one of the stars in the galaxy.,So that star is also,50 million light years away.,It's part of that galaxy, and it's shining as brightly,as the center of the galaxy,with a billion suns in it.,That's a Type Ia supernova explosion.,Now that's an incredible phenomena,,because it's a star that sits there.,It's called a carbon-oxygen dwarf.,It sits there about, say, 1.3 times the mass of the Sun.,And it has a binary companion that goes around it,,so a big star, a big ball of gas.,And what it does is it sucks gas,off its companion star,,until it gets to this limit called the Chandrasekhar limit,,and then it explodes.,And it explodes, and it shines as brightly,as a billion suns for about two weeks,,and releases, not only energy,,but a huge amount of chemical elements into the universe.,In fact, that one is a carbon-oxygen dwarf. 
 Now, there was no carbon and oxygen,in the universe at the Big Bang.,And there was no carbon and oxygen in the universe,throughout the first generation of stars.,It was made in stars like that,,locked away and then returned to the universe,in explosions like that,in order to recondense into planets,,stars, new solar systems,and, indeed, people like us.,I think that's a remarkable demonstration of the power,and beauty and universality of the laws of physics,,because we understand that process,,because we understand,the structure of atoms here on Earth. 
 This is a beautiful quote that I found --,we're talking about serendipity there -- from Alexander Fleming:,"When I woke up just after dawn,on September 28, 1928,,I certainly didn't plan to revolutionize all medicine,by discovering the world's first antibiotic.",Now, the explorers of the world of the atom,did not intend to invent the transistor.,And they certainly didn't intend to,describe the mechanics of supernova explosions,,which eventually told us where,the building blocks of life,were synthesized in the universe.,So, I think science can be --,serendipity is important.,It can be beautiful. It can reveal quite astonishing things.,It can also, I think, finally,reveal the most profound,ideas to us,about our place in the universe,and really the value of our home planet. 
 This is a spectacular picture of our home planet.,Now, it doesn't look like our home planet.,It looks like Saturn because, of course, it is.,It was taken by the Cassini space probe.,But it's a famous picture, not because of,the beauty and majesty of Saturn's rings,,but actually because of a tiny, faint blob,just hanging underneath one of the rings.,And if I blow it up there, you see it.,It looks like a moon,,but in fact, it's a picture of Earth.,It was a picture of Earth captured in that frame of Saturn.,That's our planet from 750 million miles away.,I think the Earth has got a strange property,that the farther away you get from it,,the more beautiful it seems. 
 But that is not the most distant or most famous picture of our planet.,It was taken by this thing, which is called the Voyager spacecraft.,And that's a picture of me in front of it for scale.,The Voyager is a tiny machine.,It's currently 10 billion miles away from Earth,,transmitting with that dish, with the power of 20 watts,,and we're still in contact with it.,But it visited Jupiter, Saturn,,Uranus and Neptune.,And after it visited all four of those planets,,Carl Sagan, who's one of my great heroes,,had the wonderful idea,of turning Voyager around,and taking a picture of every planet it had visited.,And it took this picture of Earth.,Now it's very hard to see the Earth there, it's called the "Pale Blue Dot" picture,,but Earth is suspended in that red shaft of light.,That's Earth from four billion miles away. 
 And I'd like to read you what,Sagan wrote about it, just to finish,,because I cannot say words as beautiful as this,to describe what he saw,in that picture that he had taken.,He said, "Consider again that dot.,That's here. That's home. That's us.,On it, everyone you love,,everyone you know, everyone you've ever heard of,,every human being who ever was,lived out their lives.,The aggregates of joy and suffering,thousands of confident religions,,ideologies and economic doctrines,,every hunter and forager, every hero and coward,,every creator and destroyer of civilization,,every king and peasant, every young couple in love,,every mother and father, hopeful child,,inventor and explorer,,every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician,,every superstar, every supreme leader,,every saint and sinner in the history of our species,,lived there, on a mote of dust,,suspended in a sunbeam.,It's been said that astronomy's a humbling,and character-building experience.,There is perhaps no better demonstration,of the folly of human conceits,than this distant image of our tiny world.,To me, it underscores our responsibility,to deal more kindly with one another,and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot,,the only home we've ever known." 
 Beautiful words about,the power of science and exploration.,The argument has always been made, and it will always be made,,that we know enough about the universe.,You could have made it in the 1920s; you wouldn't have had penicillin.,You could have made it in the 1890s; you wouldn't have the transistor.,And it's made today in these difficult economic times.,Surely, we know enough.,We don't need to discover anything else about our universe. 
 Let me leave the last words to someone,who's rapidly becoming a hero of mine,,Humphrey Davy, who did his science at the turn of the 19th century.,He was clearly under assault all the time.,"We know enough at the turn of the 19th century.,Just exploit it; just build things.",He said this, he said, "Nothing is more fatal,to the progress of the human mind,than to presume that our views of science,are ultimate,,that our triumphs are complete,,that there are no mysteries in nature,,and that there are no new worlds to conquer." 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Those of you who may remember me from TEDGlobal,remember me asking a few questions,which still preoccupy me.,One of them was: Why is it necessary to spend,six billion pounds,speeding up the Eurostar train,when, for about 10 percent of that money,,you could have top supermodels, male and female,,serving free Chateau Petrus to all the passengers,for the entire duration of the journey?,You'd still have five billion left in change,,and people would ask for the trains to be slowed down.,Now, you may remember me asking the question as well,,a very interesting observation,,that actually those strange little signs,that actually flash "35" at you,,occasionally accompanying a little smiley face,or a frown,,according to whether you're within or outside the speed limit --,those are actually more effective,at preventing road accidents than speed cameras,,which come with the actual threat,of real punishment. 
 So there seems to be a strange disproportionality at work,,I think, in many areas of human problem solving,,particularly those which involve human psychology,,which is: The tendency,of the organization or the institution,is to deploy as much force as possible,,as much compulsion as possible,,whereas actually, the tendency of the person,is to be almost influenced,in absolute reverse proportion,to the amount of force being applied.,So there seems to be a complete disconnect here.,So what I'm asking for is the creation of a new job title --,I'll come to this a little later --,and perhaps the addition of a new word,into the English language.,Because it does seem to me that large organizations,including government, which is, of course, the largest organization of all,,have actually become,completely disconnected,with what actually matters to people. 
 Let me give you one example of this.,You may remember this as the AOL-Time Warner merger, okay,,heralded at the time as the largest,single deal of all time.,It may still be, for all I know.,Now, all of you in this room, in one form or other,,are probably customers of one or both,of those organizations that merged.,Just interested, did anybody notice anything different,as a result of this at all?,So unless you happened to be a shareholder,of one or the other organizations,or one of the dealmakers or lawyers involved in the no-doubt lucrative activity,,you're actually engaging in a huge piece of activity,that meant absolutely bugger-all to anybody, okay?,By contrast, years of marketing have taught me,that if you actually want people to remember you,and to appreciate what you do,,the most potent things are actually very, very small.,This is from Virgin Atlantic upper-class,,it's the cruet salt and pepper set.,Quite nice in itself, they're little, sort of, airplane things.,What's really, really sweet is every single person looking at these things,has exactly the same mischievous thought,,which is, "I reckon I can heist these.",However, you pick them up and underneath,,actually engraved in the metal, are the words,,"Stolen from Virgin Atlantic Airways upper-class.",(Laughter),Now, years after,you remember the strategic question,of whether you're flying in a 777 or an Airbus,,you remember those words and that experience. 
 Similarly, this is from a hotel in Stockholm, the Lydmar.,Has anybody stayed there?,It's the lift, it's a series of buttons in the lift.,Nothing unusual about that at all,,except that these are actually not the buttons that take you to an individual floor.,It starts with garage at the bottom, I suppose, appropriately,,but it doesn't go up garage, grand floor, mezzanine, one, two, three, four.,It actually says garage, funk, rhythm and blues.,You have a series of buttons. You actually choose your lift music.,My guess is that the cost of installing this in the lift,in the Lydmar Hotel in Stockholm,is probably 500 to 1,000 pounds max.,It's frankly more memorable,than all those millions of hotels we've all stayed at,that tell you that your room has actually been recently renovated,at a cost of 500,000 dollars,,in order to make it resemble every other hotel room you've ever stayed in,in the entire course of your life. 
 Now, these are trivial marketing examples, I accept.,But I was at a TED event recently and Esther Duflo,,probably one of the leading experts in,,effectively, the eradication of poverty in the developing world,,actually spoke.,And she came across a similar example,of something that fascinated me,as being something which, in a business context or a government context,,would simply be so trivial a solution,as to seem embarrassing.,It was simply to encourage the inoculation of children,by, not only making it a social event --,I think good use of behavioral economics in that,,if you turn up with several other mothers,to have your child inoculated,,your sense of confidence is much greater than if you turn up alone.,But secondly, to incentivize that inoculation,by giving a kilo of lentils to everybody who participated.,It's a tiny, tiny thing.,If you're a senior person at UNESCO,and someone says, "So what are you doing,to eradicate world poverty?",you're not really confident standing up there,saying, "I've got it cracked; it's the lentils," are you? 
 Our own sense of self-aggrandizement,feels that big important problems,need to have big important, and most of all, expensive,solutions attached to them.,And yet, what behavioral economics shows time after time after time,is in human behavioral and behavioral change,there's a very, very strong disproportionality at work,,that actually what changes our behavior,and what changes our attitude to things,is not actually proportionate to the degree,of expense entailed,,or the degree of force that's applied.,But everything about institutions,makes them uncomfortable,with that disproportionality.,So what happens in an institution,is the very person who has the power to solve the problem,also has a very, very large budget.,And once you have a very, very large budget,,you actually look for expensive things to spend it on.,What is completely lacking is a class of people,who have immense amounts of power, but no money at all.,(Laughter),It's those people I'd quite like to create,in the world going forward. 
 Now, here's another thing that happens,,which is what I call sometimes "Terminal 5 syndrome,",which is that big, expensive things,get big, highly-intelligent attention,,and they're great, and Terminal 5 is absolutely magnificent,,until you get down to the small detail, the usability,,which is the signage,,which is catastrophic.,You come out of "Arrive" at the airport, and you follow,a big yellow sign that says "Trains" and it's in front of you.,So you walk for another hundred yards,,expecting perhaps another sign,,that might courteously be yellow, in front of you and saying "Trains.",No, no, no, the next one is actually blue, to your left,,and says "Heathrow Express.",I mean, it could almost be rather like that scene from the film "Airplane.",A yellow sign? That's exactly what they'll be expecting. 
 Actually, what happens in the world increasingly --,now, all credit to the British Airport Authority.,I spoke about this before,,and a brilliant person got in touch with me and said, "Okay, what can you do?",So I did come up with five suggestions, which they are actually actioning.,One of them also being,,although logically it's quite a good idea,to have a lift with no up and down button in it,,if it only serves two floors,,it's actually bloody terrifying, okay?,Because when the door closes,and there's nothing for you to do,,you've actually just stepped into a Hammer film. 
 (Laughter) 
 So these questions ... what is happening in the world,is the big stuff, actually,,is done magnificently well.,But the small stuff, what you might call the user interface,,is done spectacularly badly.,But also, there seems to be a complete sort of gridlock,in terms of solving these small solutions.,Because the people who can actually solve them,actually are too powerful and too preoccupied,with something they think of as "strategy" to actually solve them.,I tried this exercise recently, talking about banking.,They said, "Can we do an advertising campaign?,What can we do and encourage more online banking?",I said, "It's really, really easy.",I said, "When people login to their online bank,there are lots and lots of things they'd probably quite like to look at.,The last thing in the world you ever want to see is your balance.",I've got friends who actually,never use their own bank cash machines,because there's the risk that it might display,their balance on the screen. 
 Why would you willingly expose yourself to bad news?,Okay, you simply wouldn't.,I said, "If you make, actually, 'Tell me my balance.',If you make that an option rather than the default,,you'll find twice as many people log on to online banking,,and they do it three times as often.",Let's face it, most of us -- how many of you,actually check your balance before you remove cash from a cash machine?,And you're pretty rich by the standards of the world at large.,Now, interesting that no single person does that,,or at least can admit to being so anal as to do it.,But what's interesting about that suggestion,was that, to implement that suggestion wouldn't cost 10 million pounds;,it wouldn't involve large amounts of expenditure;,it would actually cost about 50 quid.,And yet, it never happens. 
 Because there's a fundamental disconnect, as I said,,that actually, the people with the power,want to do big expensive things.,And there's to some extent a big strategy myth,that's prevalent in business now.,And if you think about it, it's very, very important,that the strategy myth is maintained.,Because, if the board of directors convince everybody,that the success of any organization,is almost entirely dependent on the decisions made by the board of directors,,it makes the disparity in salaries,slightly more justifiable,than if you actually acknowledge that quite a lot of the credit for a company's success,might actually lie somewhere else,,in small pieces of tactical activity. 
 But what is happening is that effectively --,and the invention of the spreadsheet hasn't helped this;,lots of things haven't helped this --,business and government suffers from a kind of physics envy.,It wants the world to be the kind of place where,the input and the change are proportionate.,It's a kind of mechanistic world,that we'd all love to live in,where, effectively, it sits very nicely on spreadsheets,,everything is numerically expressible,,and the amount you spend on something is proportionate,to the scale of your success.,That's the world people actually want.,In truth, we do live in a world that science can understand.,Unfortunately, the science is probably closer to being climatology,in that in many cases,,very, very small changes,can have disproportionately huge effects,,and equally, vast areas of activity, enormous mergers,,can actually accomplish absolutely bugger-all.,But it's very, very uncomfortable for us,to actually acknowledge that we're living in such a world. 
 But what I'm saying is we could just make things,a little bit better for ourselves,if we looked at it in this very simple four-way approach.,That is actually strategy, and I'm not denying that strategy has a role.,You know, there are cases where you spend quite a lot of money,and you accomplish quite a lot.,And I'd be wrong to dis that completely.,Moving over, we come, of course, to consultancy. 
 (Laughter) 
 I thought it was very indecent of Accenture,to ditch Tiger Woods in such,a sort of hurried and hasty way.,I mean, Tiger surely was actually obeying the Accenture model.,He developed an interesting outsourcing model for sexual services,,(Laughter),no longer tied to a single monopoly provider,,in many cases, sourcing things locally,,and of course, the ability to have between one and three girls delivered at any time,led for better load-balancing.,So what Accenture suddenly found so unattractive about that, I'm not sure. 
 Then there are other things that don't cost much and achieve absolutely nothing.,That's called trivia.,But there's a fourth thing.,And the fundamental problem is we don't actually have a word for this stuff.,We don't know what to call it.,And actually we don't spend nearly enough money,looking for those things,,looking for those tiny things that may or may not work,,but which, if they do work,,can have a success absolutely out of proportion,to their expense, their efforts,and the disruption they cause. 
 So the first thing I'd like,is a competition -- to anybody watching this as a film --,is to come up with a name for that stuff on the bottom right.,And the second thing, I think,,is that the world needs to have people in charge of that.,That's why I call for the "Chief Detail Officer.",Every corporation should have one,,and every government should have a Ministry of Detail.,The people who actually have no money,,who have no extravagant budget,,but who realize that actually,you might achieve greater success in uptake,of a government program,by actually doubling the level of benefits you pay,,but you'll probably achieve exactly that same effect,simply by redesigning the form,and writing it in comprehensible English.,And if actually we created a Ministry of Detail,and business actually had Chief Detail Officers,,then that fourth quadrant,,which is so woefully neglected at the moment,,might finally get the attention it deserves. 
 Thank you very much.It's a great pleasure to be here.,It's a great pleasure to speak after,Brian Cox from CERN.,I think CERN is the home,of the Large Hadron Collider.,What ever happened to the Small Hadron Collider?,Where is the Small Hadron Collider?,Because the Small Hadron Collider once was the big thing.,Now, the Small Hadron Collider,is in a cupboard, overlooked and neglected.,You know when the Large Hadron Collider started,,and it didn't work, and people tried to work out why,,it was the Small Hadron Collider team,who sabotaged it,because they were so jealous.,The whole Hadron Collider family,needs unlocking. 
 The lesson of Brian's presentation, in a way --,all those fantastic pictures --,is this really:,that vantage point determines everything that you see.,What Brian was saying was,science has opened up successively different vantage points,from which we can see ourselves,,and that's why it's so valuable.,So the vantage point you take,determines virtually everything that you will see.,The question that you will ask,will determine much of the answer that you get. 
 And so if you ask this question:,Where would you look to see the future of education?,The answer that we've traditionally given to that,is very straightforward, at least in the last 20 years:,You go to Finland.,Finland is the best place in the world to see school systems.,The Finns may be a bit boring and depressive and there's a very high suicide rate,,but by golly, they are qualified.,And they have absolutely amazing education systems.,So we all troop off to Finland,,and we wonder at the social democratic miracle of Finland,and its cultural homogeneity and all the rest of it,,and then we struggle to imagine how we might,bring lessons back. 
 Well, so, for this last year,,with the help of Cisco who sponsored me,,for some balmy reason, to do this,,I've been looking somewhere else.,Because actually radical innovation does sometimes,come from the very best,,but it often comes from places,where you have huge need --,unmet, latent demand --,and not enough resources for traditional solutions to work --,traditional, high-cost solutions,,which depend on professionals,,which is what schools and hospitals are. 
 So I ended up in places like this.,This is a place called Monkey Hill.,It's one of the hundreds of favelas in Rio.,Most of the population growth of the next 50 years,will be in cities.,We'll grow by six cities of 12 million people a year,for the next 30 years.,Almost all of that growth will be in the developed world.,Almost all of that growth will be,in places like Monkey Hill.,This is where you'll find the fastest growing,young populations of the world.,So if you want recipes to work --,for virtually anything -- health, education,,government politics,and education --,you have to go to these places.,And if you go to these places, you meet people like this. 
 This is a guy called Juanderson.,At the age of 14,,in common with many 14-year-olds in the Brazilian education system,,he dropped out of school.,It was boring.,And Juanderson, instead, went into,what provided kind of opportunity and hope,in the place that he lived, which was the drugs trade.,And by the age of 16, with rapid promotion,,he was running the drugs trade in 10 favelas.,He was turning over 200,000 dollars a week.,He employed 200 people.,He was going to be dead by the age of 25.,And luckily, he met this guy,,who is Rodrigo Baggio,,the owner of the first laptop to ever appear in Brazil.,1994, Rodrigo started something,called CDI,,which took computers,donated by corporations,,put them into community centers in favelas,and created places like this.,What turned Juanderson around,was technology for learning,that made learning fun and accessible. 
 Or you can go to places like this.,This is Kibera, which is the largest slum in East Africa.,Millions of people living here,,stretched over many kilometers.,And there I met these two,,Azra on the left, Maureen on the right.,They just finished their Kenyan certificate,of secondary education.,That name should tell you that the Kenyan education system,borrows almost everything,from Britain, circa 1950,,but has managed to make it even worse.,So there are schools in slums like this.,They're places like this.,That's where Maureen went to school.,They're private schools. There are no state schools in slums.,And the education they got was pitiful.,It was in places like this. This a school set up by some nuns,in another slum called Nakuru.,Half the children in this classroom have no parents,because they've died through AIDS.,The other half have one parent,because the other parent has died through AIDS.,So the challenges of education,in this kind of place,are not to learn the kings and queens of Kenya or Britain.,They are to stay alive, to earn a living,,to not become HIV positive.,The one technology that spans rich and poor,in places like this,is not anything to do with industrial technology.,It's not to do with electricity or water.,It's the mobile phone.,If you want to design from scratch,virtually any service in Africa,,you would start now with the mobile phone.,Or you could go to places like this. 
 This is a place called the Madangiri Settlement Colony,,which is a very developed slum,about 25 minutes outside New Delhi,,where I met these characters,who showed me around for the day.,The remarkable thing about these girls,,and the sign of the kind of social revolution,sweeping through the developing world,is that these girls are not married.,Ten years ago, they certainly would have been married.,Now they're not married, and they want to go on,to study further, to have a career.,They've been brought up by mothers who are illiterate,,who have never ever done homework.,All across the developing world there are millions of parents --,tens, hundreds of millions --,who for the first time,are with children doing homework and exams.,And the reason they carry on studying,is not because they went to a school like this.,This is a private school.,This is a fee-pay school. This is a good school.,This is the best you can get,in Hyderabad in Indian education.,The reason they went on studying was this. 
 This is a computer installed in the entrance to their slum,by a revolutionary social entrepreneur,called Sugata Mitra,who has conducted the most radical experiments,,showing that children, in the right conditions,,can learn on their own with the help of computers.,Those girls have never touched Google.,They know nothing about Wikipedia.,Imagine what their lives would be like,if you could get that to them. 
 So if you look, as I did,,through this tour,,and by looking at about a hundred case studies,of different social entrepreneurs,working in these very extreme conditions,,look at the recipes that they come up with for learning,,they look nothing like school.,What do they look like?,Well, education is a global religion.,And education, plus technology,,is a great source of hope.,You can go to places like this. 
 This is a school three hours outside of Sao Paulo.,Most of the children there have parents who are illiterate.,Many of them don't have electricity at home.,But they find it completely obvious,to use computers, websites,,make videos, so on and so forth.,When you go to places like this,what you see is that,education in these settings,works by pull, not push.,Most of our education system is push.,I was literally pushed to school.,When you get to school, things are pushed at you:,knowledge, exams,,systems, timetables.,If you want to attract people like Juanderson,who could, for instance,,buy guns, wear jewelry,,ride motorbikes and get girls,through the drugs trade,,and you want to attract him into education,,having a compulsory curriculum doesn't really make sense.,That isn't really going to attract him.,You need to pull him.,And so education needs to work by pull, not push. 
 And so the idea of a curriculum,is completely irrelevant in a setting like this.,You need to start education,from things that make a difference,to them in their settings.,What does that?,Well, the key is motivation, and there are two aspects to it.,One is to deliver extrinsic motivation,,that education has a payoff.,Our education systems all work,on the principle that there is a payoff,,but you have to wait quite a long time.,That's too long if you're poor.,Waiting 10 years for the payoff from education,is too long when you need to meet daily needs,,when you've got siblings to look after,or a business to help with.,So you need education to be relevant and help people,to make a living there and then, often.,And you also need to make it intrinsically interesting. 
 So time and again, I found people like this.,This is an amazing guy, Sebastiao Rocha,,in Belo Horizonte,,in the third largest city in Brazil.,He's invented more than 200 games,to teach virtually any subject under the sun.,In the schools and communities,that Taio works in,,the day always starts in a circle,and always starts from a question.,Imagine an education system that started from questions,,not from knowledge to be imparted,,or started from a game, not from a lesson,,or started from the premise,that you have to engage people first,before you can possibly teach them.,Our education systems,,you do all that stuff afterward, if you're lucky,,sport, drama, music.,These things, they teach through.,They attract people to learning,because it's really a dance project,or a circus project,or, the best example of all --,El Sistema in Venezuela --,it's a music project.,And so you attract people through that into learning,,not adding that on after,all the learning has been done,and you've eaten your cognitive greens. 
 So El Sistema in Venezuela,uses a violin as a technology of learning.,Taio Rocha uses making soap,as a technology of learning.,And what you find when you go to these schemes,is that they use people and places,in incredibly creative ways.,Masses of peer learning.,How do you get learning to people,when there are no teachers,,when teachers won't come, when you can't afford them,,and even if you do get teachers,,what they teach isn't relevant to the communities that they serve?,Well, you create your own teachers.,You create peer-to-peer learning,,or you create para-teachers, or you bring in specialist skills.,But you find ways to get learning that's relevant to people,through technology, people and places that are different. 
 So this is a school in a bus,on a building site,in Pune, the fastest growing city in Asia.,Pune has 5,000 building sites.,It has 30,000 children,on those building sites.,That's one city.,Imagine that urban explosion,that's going to take place across the developing world,and how many thousands of children,will spend their school years on building sites.,Well, this is a very simple scheme,to get the learning to them through a bus.,And they all treat learning,,not as some sort of academic, analytical activity,,but as that's something that's productive,,something you make,,something that you can do, perhaps earn a living from. 
 So I met this character, Steven.,He'd spent three years in Nairobi living on the streets,because his parents had died of AIDS.,And he was finally brought back into school,,not by the offer of GCSEs,,but by the offer of learning how to become a carpenter,,a practical making skill.,So the trendiest schools in the world,,High Tech High and others,,they espouse a philosophy of learning as productive activity.,Here, there isn't really an option.,Learning has to be productive,in order for it to make sense. 
 And finally, they have a different model of scale,,and it's a Chinese restaurant model,of how to scale.,And I learned it from this guy,,who is an amazing character.,He's probably the most remarkable social entrepreneur,in education in the world.,His name is Madhav Chavan,,and he created something called Pratham.,And Pratham runs preschool play groups,for, now, 21 million children in India.,It's the largest NGO in education in the world.,And it also supports working-class kids going into Indian schools.,He's a complete revolutionary.,He's actually a trade union organizer by background,,and that's how he learned the skills,to build his organization. 
 When they got to a certain stage,,Pratham got big enough to attract,some pro bono support from McKinsey.,McKinsey came along and looked at his model and said,,"You know what you should do with this, Madhav?,You should turn it into McDonald's.,And what you do when you go to any new site,is you kind of roll out a franchise.,And it's the same wherever you go.,It's reliable and people know exactly where they are.,And there will be no mistakes.",And Madhav said,,"Why do we have to do it that way?,Why can't we do it more like the Chinese restaurants?" 
 There are Chinese restaurants everywhere,,but there is no Chinese restaurant chain.,Yet, everyone knows what is a Chinese restaurant.,They know what to expect, even though it'll be subtly different,and the colors will be different and the name will be different.,You know a Chinese restaurant when you see it.,These people work with the Chinese restaurant model --,same principles, different applications and different settings --,not the McDonald's model.,The McDonald's model scales.,The Chinese restaurant model spreads. 
 So mass education,started with social entrepreneurship,in the 19th century.,And that's desperately what we need again,on a global scale.,And what can we learn from all of that?,Well, we can learn a lot,because our education systems,are failing desperately in many ways.,They fail to reach the people,they most need to serve.,They often hit their target but miss the point.,Improvement is increasingly,difficult to organize;,our faith in these systems, incredibly fraught.,And this is just a very simple way of,understanding what kind of innovation,,what kind of different design we need. 
 There are two basic types of innovation.,There's sustaining innovation,,which will sustain an existing institution or an organization,,and disruptive innovation,that will break it apart, create some different way of doing it.,There are formal settings --,schools, colleges, hospitals --,in which innovation can take place,,and informal settings -- communities,,families, social networks.,Almost all our effort goes in this box,,sustaining innovation in formal settings,,getting a better version,of the essentially Bismarckian school system,that developed in the 19th century.,And as I said, the trouble with this is that,,in the developing world,there just aren't teachers to make this model work.,You'd need millions and millions of teachers,in China, India, Nigeria,and the rest of developing world to meet need.,And in our system, we know,that simply doing more of this won't eat into,deep educational inequalities,,especially in inner cities,and former industrial areas. 
 So that's why we need three more kinds of innovation.,We need more reinvention.,And all around the world now you see,more and more schools reinventing themselves.,They're recognizably schools, but they look different.,There are Big Picture schools,in the U.S. and Australia.,There are Kunskapsskolan schools,in Sweden.,Of 14 of them,,only two of them are in schools.,Most of them are in other buildings not designed as schools.,There is an amazing school in Northen Queensland,called Jaringan.,And they all have the same kind of features:,highly collaborative, very personalized,,often pervasive technology,,learning that starts from questions,and problems and projects,,not from knowledge and curriculum.,So we certainly need more of that. 
 But because so many of the issues in education,aren't just in school,,they're in family and community,,what you also need, definitely,,is more on the right hand side.,You need efforts to supplement schools.,The most famous of these is Reggio Emilia in Italy,,the family-based learning system,to support and encourage people in schools.,The most exciting is the Harlem Children's Zone,,which over 10 years, led by Geoffrey Canada,,has, through a mixture of schooling,and family and community projects,,attempted to transform not just education in schools,,but the entire culture and aspiration,of about 10,000 families in Harlem.,We need more of that,completely new and radical thinking.,You can go to places an hour away, less,,from this room,,just down the road, which need that,,which need radicalism of a kind that we haven't imagined. 
 And finally, you need transformational innovation,that could imagine getting learning to people,in completely new and different ways.,So we are on the verge, 2015,,of an amazing achievement,,the schoolification of the world.,Every child up to the age of 15 who wants a place in school,will be able to have one in 2015.,It's an amazing thing.,But it is,,unlike cars, which have developed,so rapidly and orderly,,actually the school system is recognizably,an inheritance from the 19th century,,from a Bismarkian model of German schooling,that got taken up by English reformers,,and often by,religious missionaries,,taken up in the United States,as a force of social cohesion,,and then in Japan and South Korea as they developed. 
 It's recognizably 19th century in its roots.,And of course it's a huge achievement.,And of course it will bring great things.,It will bring skills and learning and reading.,But it will also lay waste to imagination.,It will lay waste to appetite. It will lay waste to social confidence.,It will stratify society,as much as it liberates it.,And we are bequeathing to the developing world,school systems that they will now spend,a century trying to reform.,That is why we need really radical thinking,,and why radical thinking is now,more possible and more needed than ever in how we learn. 
 Thank you. (Applause)I'm a bug lover, myself --,not from childhood, by the way,,but rather late.,When I bachelored,,majoring in zoologynat Tel Aviv University,,I kind of fell in love with bugs.,And then, within zoology,,I took the coursenor the discipline of entomology,,the science of insects.,And then I thought to myself,nhow can I be practical,or help in the science of entomology?,And then I moved to the worldnof plant protection --,plant protection from insects,,from bad bugs.,And then within plant protection,,I came into the disciplinenof biological pest control,,which we actually define,as the use of living organisms,to reduce populationsnof noxious plant pests.,So it's a whole disciplinenin plant protection,aimed at the reduction of chemicals. 
 And biological pest control, by the way,,or these "good bugs"nthat we are talking about,,they've existed in the worldnfor thousands and thousands of years,,for a long, long time.,But only in the last 120 years,,people started, or peoplenknew more and more,how to exploit, or how to use,nthis biological control phenomenon,,or in fact, natural control phenomenon,,for their own needs.,Because biological control phenomenon --nyou can see it in your backyard.,Just take a magnifying glass.nYou see what I have here?,That's a magnifier, times 10.,You just open it, twist leaves,,and you see a whole new worldnof minute insects,,or little spiders of one millimeter,none-and-a-half, two millimeters long,,and you can distinguishnbetween the good ones and the bad ones.,So this phenomenon of natural controlnexists literally everywhere.,Here, in front of this building, I'm sure.,Just have a look at the plants.,So it's everywhere,nand we need to know how to exploit it. 
 Well, let's go hand by hand,and browse through just a few examples.,What is a pest?,What damage does it actuallyninflict on the plant?,And what is the natural enemy,,the biological control agent,nor the "good bug",that we're talking about?,In general, I'm going to talknabout insects and spiders,,or mites, let us call them.,Insects, those six-legged organisms,and spiders or mites,nthe eight-legged organisms.,Let's have a look at that.,Here is a devastating pest, a spider mite,,because it does a lotnof webbing, like a spider.,You see the mother in between,,and two daughters, probably,non the left and right,,and a single egg on the right-hand side.,And then you seenwhat kind of damage it can inflict. 
 On your right-hand side,nyou can see a cucumber leaf,,in the middle, a cotton leaf,,and on the left, a tomato leafnwith these little stipplings.,They can literally turnnfrom green to white,,because of the sucking, piercingnmouth parts of those spiders. 
 But here comes nature,nthat provides us with a good spider.,This is a predatory mite --njust as small as a spider mite;,one, two millimeters long,nnot more than that --,running quickly, hunting,nchasing the spider mites.,And here, you can see this ladynin action on your left-hand side --,just pierces, sucks the body fluidsnon the left-hand side of the pest mite.,And after five minutes,nthis is what you see:,just a typical dead corpse --,the shriveled, sucked-out,ndead corpse of the spider mite,,and next to it, two satiatednindividuals, predatory mites,,a mother on the left-hand side,na young nymph on the right-hand side.,By the way, a meal for them for 24 hours,,is about five of the spider mites,nof the bad mites,,and-or 15 to 20 eggs of the pest mites.,By the way, they are always hungry. 
 (Laughter) 
 And here is another example: aphids.,It's springtime now in Israel.,When temperatures rise sharply,,you can see those bad ones,nthose aphids, all over the plants --,in your hibiscus, in your lantana,,in the young, fresh foliagenof the so-called spring flush.,By the way, with aphids you havenonly females, like Amazons.,Females giving rise to females,ngiving rise to other females.,No males at all.,Parthenogenesis, as it's so called.,And they're very happynwith that, apparently. 
 (Laughter) 
 Here we can see the damage.,Those aphids secrete a sticky,nsugary liquid called honeydew,,and this just clogsnthe upper parts of the plant.,Here you see a typical cucumber leafnthat turned from green to black,because of a black fungus, sooty mold,nwhich is covering it. 
 And here comes the salvation,nthrough this parasitic wasp.,Here we are not talking about a predator.,Here we are talking a parasite --,not a two-legged parasite,,but an eight-legged parasite, of course.,This is a parasitic wasp,,again, two millimeters long, slender,na very quick and sharp flier.,And here you can seenthis parasite in action,,like in an acrobatic maneuver.,She stands vis-à-vis,in front of the victimnat the right-hand side,,bending its abdomennand inserting a single egg,into the body fluids of the aphid.,By the way, the aphid tries to escape.,She kicks and bitesnand secretes different liquids,,but nothing will happen, in fact --,only the egg of the parasitoidnwill be inserted,into the body fluids of the aphid.,And after a few days,ndepending upon temperature,,the egg will hatch,and the larva of this parasitenwill eat the aphid from the inside. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is all natural. This is all natural.,This is not fiction, nothing at all.,Again -- in your backyard.nIn your backyard. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 But this is the end result: mummies.,This is the visual resultnof a dead aphid encompassing inside,,a developing parasitoid that,nafter a few minutes, you see halfway out.,The birth is almost complete.,You can see, by the way,nin different movies, etc.,,it takes just a few minutes.,And if this is a female,nshe'll immediately mate with a male,and off she goes,nbecause time is very short.,This female can livenonly three to four days,,and she needs to give risento around 400 eggs.,That means she has 400 bad aphids,to put her eggs into their body fluids.,This is, of course, not the end of it. 
 There is a whole wealthnof other natural enemies,and this is just the last example.,Again, we'll start first with the pest:,the thrips.,By the way, all these weird names --,I didn't bother you with the Latinnnames of these creatures,,just the popular names.,But this is a nice,nslender, very bad pest.,If you can see this: sweet peppers.,This is not just an exotic,nornamental sweet pepper.,This is a sweet peppernwhich is not consumable,because it is sufferingnfrom a viral disease,transmitted by those thrip adults.,And here comes the natural enemy,nminute pirate bug --,"minute," because it is rather small.,Here you can see the adult,nblack, and two young ones.,And again, in action.,This adult pierces the thrips,,sucking it within just several minutes,,going to the other prey,ncontinuing all over the place.,And if we spread those minutenpirate bugs, the good ones,,for example, in a sweet pepper plot,,they go to the flowers.,And look -- this flower is floodednwith predatory bugs, with the good ones,,after wiping out the bad ones, the thrips.,So this is a very positive situation.,No harm to the developing fruit.nNo harm to the fruit set.,Everything is just finenunder these circumstances.,But again, the question is,,here you saw them on a one-to-one basis --nthe pest, the natural enemy. 
 What we do is actually this.,In Northeast Israel,nin Kibbutz Sde Eliyahu,,there is a facility that mass-producesnthose natural enemies.,In other words, what we do therenis amplify the natural control,,or the biological control phenomenon.,And in 30,000 square metersnof state-of-the-art greenhouses,,there, we are mass-producingnthose predatory mites,,those minute pirate bugs,,those parasitic wasps, etc.,Many different parts.,By the way, they havena very nice landscape --,you see the Jordanian Mountainsnon the one hand,,and the Jordan Valley on the other hand,,and a good, mild winternand a nice, hot summer,,which is an excellent conditionnto mass-produce those creatures.,And by the way, mass-production --nit is not genetic manipulation.,There are no GMOs -- geneticallynmodified organisms -- whatsoever.,We take them from nature,,and the only thing that we donis give them the optimal conditions,,under the greenhousesnor in the climate rooms,,in order to proliferate,nmultiply and reproduce.,And that's what we get. 
 You see under a microscope.,You see in the upper left corner?nYou see a single predatory mite.,And this is the whole bunchnof predatory mites.,You see this ampul. You see this one.,I have one gram of those predatory mites.,One gram is 80,000 individuals.,80,000 individuals are good enoughnto control one acre,,4,000 square meters,,of a strawberry plot,against spider mites for the whole season,of almost one year.,And we can producenfrom this, believe you me,,several dozens of kilogramsnon an annual basis.,So this is what I callnamplification of the phenomenon.,And no, we do not disrupt the balance.,On the contrary,,because we bring it to every cultural plot,where the balance was already disrupted,by the chemicals.,Here we come with those natural enemies,in order to reversena little bit of the wheel,and to bring more natural balancento the agricultural plot,by reducing those chemicals.,That's the whole idea. 
 And what is the impact?,In this table, you cannactually see what is an impact,of a successful biologicalncontrol by good bugs.,For example, in Israel, where we employnmore than 1,000 hectares --,10,000 dunams in Israeli terms --,of biological pestsncontrolling sweet pepper,under protection,,75 percent of the pesticidesnwere actually reduced.,And Israeli strawberries, even more --,80 percent of the pesticides,,especially those aimednagainst pest mites in strawberries.,So the impact is very strong.,And there goes the question,,especially if you askngrowers, agriculturists:,Why biological control?,Why good bugs?,By the way, the number of answers you get,equals the number of people you ask.,But if we go, for example,nto this place, Southeast Israel,,the Arava areanabove the Great Rift Valley,,where the pearl of Israelinagriculture is located,,especially under greenhouse conditions,nor under screenhouse conditions --,if you drive all the waynto Eilat, you see this,just in the middle of the desert.,And if you zoom in,,you can definitely watch this:,grandparents with their grandchildren,,distributing the naturalnenemies, the good bugs,,instead of wearing special clothes,and gas masks and applying chemicals.,So safety, with respectnto the application,,is the number one answernthat we get from growers,,for "Why biological control?" 
 Number two, many growersnare, in fact, petrified,by the idea of resistance,,that the pests will becomenresistant to the chemicals,,just like in our case, that bacterianbecomes resistant to antibiotics.,It's the same, and it cannhappen very quickly.,Fortunately, in either biological controlnor even natural control,,resistance is extremely rare.,It hardly happens.,Because this is evolution,nthis is the natural ratio,,unlike resistance, which happensnin the case of chemicals. 
 And thirdly, public demand.,The more the public demandsnthe reduction of chemicals,,the more growers become aware of the fact,that they should, wherever they cannand wherever possible,,replace the chemical controlnwith biological control.,Even here, there is another grower,,you see, very interested in the bugs,nthe bad ones and the good ones,,wearing this magnifiernalready on her head,,just walking safely in her crop. 
 Finally, I want to get to my vision,,or, in fact, to my dream.,Because, you see, this is the reality.,Have a look at the gap.,If we take the overall turnover,of the biocontrol industry worldwide,,it's 250 million dollars.,And look at the overall pesticide industry,in all the crops throughout the world.,I think it's times 100nor something like that.,Twenty-five billion.,So there is a huge gap to bridge.,So actually, how can we do it?,How can we bridge, or let's say,nnarrow, this gap over the years?,First of all, we need to find more robust,,good and reliable biological solutions,,more good bugs that we canneither mass-produce,or actually conserve in the field.,Secondly, to create even more intensivenand strict public demand,for the reduction of chemicalsnin agricultural fresh produce.,And thirdly, also to increasenawareness by the growers,to the potential of this industry.,And this gap really narrows.,Step by step, it does narrow. 
 So I think my last slide is:,All we are saying --nwe can actually sing it --,Give nature a chance.,I'm saying it on behalfnof all the biocontrol practitioners,and implementers,,in Israel and abroad,,really give nature a chance. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Mountain biking in Israel,is something that I do with great passion,and commitment.,And when I'm on my bike,,I feel that I connect,with the profound beauty of Israel,,and I feel that I'm united,with this country's history,and biblical law.,And also, for me,,biking is a matter of empowerment.,When I reach the summit,of a steep mountain in the middle of nowhere,,I feel young,,invincible, eternal.,It's as if I'm connecting with some legacy,or with some energy,far greater than myself.,You can see my fellow riders,at the end of the picture,,looking at me with some concern.,And here is another picture of them.,Unfortunately, I cannot show their faces,,neither can I disclose their true names,,and that's because my fellow riders,are juvenile inmates,,offenders,spending time in a correction facility,about 20 minutes' ride from here --,well, like everything in Israel.,And I've been riding with these kids once a week,,every Tuesday, rain or shine, for the last four years,and by now, they've become a very big part of my life. 
 This story began four years ago.,The correction facility where they are locked up,happens to be right in the middle,of one of my usual trips,,and it's surrounded by barbed wires,and electric gates and armed guards.,So on one of these rides,,I talked my way into the compound,and went to see the warden.,I told the warden,that I wanted to start a mountain biking club in this place,and that basically I wanted to take the kids,from here to there.,And I told him, "Let's find a way,in which I'll be able to take out 10 kids once a week,to ride with in the summer in the country.",And the warden was quite amused,,and he told me he thought that I was a nut,and he told me,,"This place is a correction facility. These guys are serious offenders.,They are supposed to be locked up.,They aren't supposed to be out at large.",And yet, we began to talk about it,,and one thing led to another.,And I can't see myself,going into a state prison in New Jersey,and making such a proposition,,but this being Israel,,the warden somehow made it happen.,And so two months later,,we found ourselves "at large" --,myself,,10 juvenile inmates,and a wonderful fellow named Russ,,who became a very good friend of mine,and my partner in this project. 
 And in the next few weeks, I had the tremendous pleasure,of introducing these kids,to the world of total freedom,,a world consisting of magnificent vistas,like these --,everything you see here is obviously in Israel --,as well as close encounters,with all sorts of small creatures,coming in all sorts of sizes,,colors, shapes, forms,and so on.,In spite of all this splendor,,the beginning was extremely frustrating.,Every small obstacle,,every slight uphill,,would cause these fellows,to stop in their tracks and give up.,So we had a lot of this going on.,I found out that they had a very hard time,dealing with frustration and difficulties --,not because they were physically unfit.,But that's one reason why they ended up where they were.,And I became increasingly more and more agitated,,because I was there,not only to be with them,,but also to ride and create a team,and I didn't know what to do. 
 Now, let me give you an example.,We're going downhill in some rocky terrain,,and the front tire of Alex,gets caught in one of these crevasses here.,So he crashes down,,and he gets slightly injured,,but this does not prevent him from jumping up,and then starting to jump up and down on his bike,and curse violently.,Then he throws his helmet in the air.,His backpack goes ballistic in some other direction.,And then he runs to the nearest tree,and starts to break branches and throw rocks,and curse like I've never heard.,And I'm just standing there,,watching this scene,with a complete disbelief,,not knowing what to do.,I'm used to algorithms,and data structures,and super motivated students,,and nothing in my background,prepared me to deal,with a raging, violent adolescent,in the middle of nowhere.,And you have to realize that these incidents,did not happen in convenient locations.,They happened in places like this,,in the Judean Desert,,20 kilometers away from the nearest road.,And what you don't see in this picture,is that somewhere between these riders there,,there's a teenager sitting on a rock,,saying, "I'm not moving from here. Forget it.,I've had it.",Well, that's a problem,because one way or another, you have to get this guy moving,because it's getting dark soon and dangerous. 
 It took me several such incidents to figure out what I was supposed to do.,At the beginning, it was a disaster.,I tried harsh words and threats,and they took me nowhere.,That's what they had all their lives.,And at some point I found out,,when a kid like this gets into a fit,,the best thing that you can possibly do,is stay as close as possible to this kid,,which is difficult,,because what you really want to do is go away.,But that's what he had all his life,,people walking away from him.,So what you have to do is stay close,and try to reach in,and pet his shoulder,or give him a piece of chocolate.,So I would say, "Alex, I know that it's terribly difficult.,Why don't you rest for a few minutes,and then we'll go on.","Go away you maniac-psychopath.,Why would you bring us to this goddamn place?",And I would say, "Relax, Alex.,Here's a piece of chocolate.",And Alex would go, "Arrrrggg!",Because you have to understand,that on these rides we are constantly hungry --,and after the rides also. 
 And who is this guy, Alex, to begin with?,He's a 17-year-old.,When he was eight,,someone put him on a boat in Odessa,and sent him, shipped him to Israel,on his own.,And he ended up in south Tel Aviv,and did not have the good luck,to be picked up by a [unclear],and roamed the streets,and became a prominent gang member.,And he spent the last 10 years of his life,in two places only,,the slums and the state prison,,where he spent the last two years,before he ended up sitting on this rock there.,And so this kid,was probably abused,,abandoned, ignored, betrayed,by almost every adult along the way.,So, for such a kid,,when an adult that he learns to respect stays close to him,and doesn't walk away from him,in any situation,,irrespective of how he behaves,,it's a tremendous healing experience.,It's an act of unconditional acceptance,,something that he never had. 
 I want to say a few words about vision.,When I started this program four years ago,,I had this original plan,of creating a team,of winning underdogs.,I had an image of Lance Armstrong,in my mind.,And it took me exactly two months,of complete frustration,to realize that this vision,was misplaced,,and that there was another vision,supremely more important,and more readily available.,It all of a sudden dawned on me, in this project,,that the purpose of these rides,should actually be,to expose the kids,to one thing only: love.,Love to the country, to the uphill,and the downhill,,to all the incredible creatures that surround us --,the animals, the plants,,the insects --,love and respect,to other fellow members in your team,,in your biking team,,and most importantly,,love and respect to yourself,,which is something,that they badly miss. 
 Together with the kids,,I also went through a remarkable transformation.,Now, I come from a cutthroat world,of science and high technology.,I used to think that reason and logic,and relentless drive,were the only ways to make things happen.,And before I worked with the kids,,anything that I did with them,,or anything that I did with myself,,was supposed to be perfect,,ideal, optimal,,but after working with them for some time,,I discovered the great virtues of empathy,and flexibility,and being able to start with some vision,,and if the vision doesn't work, well nothing happened.,All you have to do is play with it, change it a little bit,,and come up with something that does help, that does work.,So right now, I feel more,like these are my principles,,and if you don't like them,,I have others. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 And one of these principles,is focus.,Before each ride,we sit together with the kids,,and we give them one word,to think about during the ride.,You have to focus their attention on something,because so many things happen.,So these are words like "teamwork",or "endurance",or even complicated concepts,like "resource allocation",or "perspective," a word that they don't understand.,You know, perspective,is one of these critically important,life-coping strategies,that mountain biking can really teach you.,I tell kids,when they struggle through some uphill,and feel like they cannot take it anymore,,it really helps to ignore the immediate obstacles,and raise your head and look around,and see how the vista around you grows.,It literally propels you upwards.,That's what perspective is all about.,Or you can also look back in time,and realize that you've already conquered,steeper mountains before.,And that's how they develop self-esteem. 
 Now, let me give you an example of how it works.,You stand with your bike at the beginning of February.,It's very cold, and you're standing in one of these rainy days,,and it's drizzling,and cold and chilly,,and you're standing in, let's say, Yokneam.,And you look up at the sky through a hole in the clouds,you see the monastery at the top of the Muhraka --,that's where you're supposed to climb now --,and you say, "There's no way that I could possibly get there.",And yet, two hours later,you find yourself standing on the roof of this monastery,,smeared with mud,,blood and sweat.,And you look down at Yokneam;,everything is so small and tiny.,And you say, "Hey, Alex. Look at this parking lot where we started.,It's that big.,I can't believe that I did it.",And that's the point,when you start loving yourself. 
 And so we talked about,these special words that we teach them.,And at the end of each ride, we sit together,and share moments,in which those special words of the day,popped up and made a difference,,and these discussions,can be extremely inspiring.,In one of them, one of the kids once said,,"When we were riding on this ridge,overlooking the Dead Sea --,and he's talking about this spot here --,"I was reminded,of the day when I left my village in Ethiopia,and went away together with my brother.,We walked 120 kilometers,until we reached Sudan.,This was the first place where we got some water and supplies.",And he goes on saying, and everyone looks at him like a hero,,probably for the first time in his life.,And he says -- because I also have volunteers riding with me,,adults, who are sitting there,listening to him --,and he says, "And this was just the beginning,of our ordeal,until we ended up in Israel.,And only now," he says,,"I'm beginning to understand where I am,,and I actually like it.",Now I remember, when he said it,,I felt goosebumps on my body,,because he said it overlooking the Moab Mountains here in the background.,That's where Joshua descended,and crossed the Jordan,and led the people of Israel into the land of Canaan,3,000 years ago,in this final leg,of the journey from Africa. 
 And so, perspective,and context and history,play key roles,in the way I plan my rides,with the kids.,We visit Kibbutzim,that were established by Holocaust survivors.,We explore ruins,of Palestinian villages,,and we discuss how they became ruins.,And we go through numerous remnants,of Jewish settlements, Nabatic settlements,,Canaanite settlements --,three-, four, five-thousand years old.,And through this tapestry,,which is the history of this country,,the kids acquire,what is probably the most important,value in education,,and that is the understanding that life is complex,,and there's no black and white.,And by appreciating complexity,,they become more tolerant,,and tolerance leads to hope. 
 I ride with these kids once a week,,every Tuesday.,Here's a picture I took last Tuesday -- less than a week ago --,and I ride with them tomorrow also.,In every one of these rides,I always end up standing in one of these incredible locations,,taking in this incredible landscape around me,,and I feel blessed and fortunate,that I'm alive,,and that I sense every fiber,in my aching body.,And I feel blessed and fortunate,that 15 years ago,I had the courage to resign,my tenured position at NYU,and return to my home country,where I can do these incredible rides,with this group of troubled kids,coming from Ethiopia,and Morocco and Russia.,And I feel blessed and fortunate,that every week, every Tuesday --,and actually every Friday also --,I can once again celebrate,in the marrow of my bones,the very essence of living in Israel on the edge. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm Ellen and I'm totallynobsessed with food.,But I didn't start out obsessed with food.,I started out obsessednwith global security policy,,because I lived in New York during 9/11nand it was a very relevant thing.,I got from global security policy to food,because I realized when I'm hungry,nI'm really pissed off,,and I'm assumingnthe rest of the world is too.,Especially if you and your kids are hungrynand your neighbor's kids are hungry,and your whole neighborhood is hungry.,And actually, it looks likenthe areas of the world that are hungry,are also the areas of the worldnthat are pretty insecure. 
 So I took a job at the United NationsnWorld Food Programme,as a way to try to addressnthese security issues,through food security issues.,There, I came across what I thinknis the most brilliant of their programs.,It's called School Feedingnand it's a really simple idea,to get in the middlenof the cycle of poverty and hunger,that continues for a lot of peoplenaround the world, and stop it.,A free school meal gets kids into school,,which is education,nthe first step out of poverty,,but it also gives them the micronutrientsnand the macronutrients they need,to develop mentally and physically. 
 While I was working at the UN,nI met this girl. Her name is Lauren Bush.,And she had this really awesome ideanto sell the bag, called the "Feed Bag" --,which is really beautifully ironicnbecause you can strap on the Feed Bag.,But each bag we'd sell would provide,a year's worthnof school meals for one kid.,It's so simple, and we thought, OK,,it costs between 20 and 50 bucksnto provide school feeding for a year.,We could sell these bagsnand raise a ton of money and awareness,for the World Food Programme.,But at the UN,nsometimes things move slowly,and they basically said no.,And we thought, this is such a good idea,nit's going to raise so much money.,So we said screw it,nwe'll start our own company,,which we did, three years ago.,That was my first dream,nto start this company called FEED,,and here's a screenshot of our website.,We did a bag for Haitinjust a month after the earthquake,to provide school meals for kids in Haiti.,So FEED's doing great.,We've so far provided 55 million mealsnto kids around the world,by selling now 550,000 bags,na ton of bags, a lot of bags. 
 All this time you're really --,hunger is a hard thing to think about,,because what we think about is eating.,I think about eating a lotnand I really love it.,And the thing that's strangenabout international hunger,and talking about international issues,is that most people want to know:,"What are you doing for America's kids?",There's definitely hunger in America:,49 million peoplenand almost 16.7 million children.,I mean that's pretty dramaticnfor our own country.,Hunger definitely meansnsomething different in America,than it does internationally,,but it's incredibly importantnto address hunger in our own country.,But the bigger problemnthat we all know about is obesity,,and it's dramatic.,The other thing that's dramatic,is that both hunger and obesitynhave really risen in the last 30 years.,Unfortunately, obesity'snnot only an American problem.,It's actually been spreadingnall around the world,and mainly through our kindnof food systems that we're exporting.,The numbers are pretty crazy.,There's a billion peoplenobese or overweight,and a billion people hungry. 
 So those seem likentwo bifurcated problems,,but I kind of startednto think about, you know,,what is obesity and hunger?,What are both those things about?,Well, they're both about food.,And when you think about food,,the underpinning of food in both casesnis potentially problematic agriculture.,And agriculture is where food comes from.,Agriculture in America's very interesting.,It's very consolidated,and the foods that are producednlead to the foods that we eat.,The foods that are produced are,nmore or less, corn, soy and wheat.,And that's three-quartersnof the food that we're eating:,processed foods and fast foods.,Unfortunately, in our agricultural system,,we haven't done a good jobnin the last three decades,of exporting those technologiesnaround the world.,So African agriculture, which is the placenof most hunger in the world,,has actually fallen precipitouslynas hunger has risen.,So somehow we're not making the connect,between exportingna good agricultural system,that will help feed peoplenall around the world. 
 Who is farming?nThat's what I was wondering.,So I went and stoodnon a big grain bin in the Midwest,,and that really didn't help menunderstand farming,,but I think it's a really cool picture.,And the reality isnthat between farmers in America --,who actually, quite frankly,nwhen I spend time in the Midwest,,are pretty large in general.,And their farms are also large.,But farmers in the rest of the worldnare actually quite skinny,,and that's because they're starving.,Most hungry people in the worldnare subsistence farmers.,And most of those people are women --,which is a totally other topicnthat I won't get on right now,,but I'd love to donthe feminist thing at some point.,I think it's really interesting to looknat agriculture from these two sides.,There's this large, consolidated farmingnthat's led to what we eat in America,,and it's really been since around 1980,nafter the oil crisis,,when, you know -- mass consolidation,,mass exodus of small farmersnin this country.,And then in the same time period,,we've kind of left Africa's farmersnto do their own thing.,Unfortunately, what is farmednends up as what we eat.,And in America, a lot of what we eatnhas led to obesity,and has led to a real change,in sort of what our diet is,nin the last 30 years. 
 It's crazy.,A fifth of kids under two drinks soda.,Hello! You don't put soda in bottles.,But people do, because it's so cheap,,and so our whole food systemnin the last 30 years has really shifted.,I mean, you know,nit's not just in our own country,,but really we're exportingnthe system around the world,,and when you look at the datanof least developed countries --,especially in cities,nwhich are growing really rapidly --,people are eatingnAmerican processed foods.,And in one generation,nthey're going from hunger,and all of the detrimentalnhealth effects of hunger,to obesity and things like diabetesnand heart disease in one generation.,So the problematic food systemnis affecting both hunger and obesity.,Not to beat a dead horse,nbut this is a global food system,where there's a billion people hungrynand a billion people obese.,I think that's the only way to look at it.,And instead of taking these two things,as bifurcated problemsnthat are very separate,,it's really importantnto look at them as one system.,We get a lot of our foodnfrom all around the world,and people from all around the worldnare importing our food system,,so it's incredibly relevantnto start a new way of looking at it. 
 I've learned --nand the technology people here,,which I'm totally not one of --,but apparently, it really takes 30 years,for a lot of technologiesnto become really endemic to us,,like the mousenand the Internet and Windows.,You know, there's 30-year cycles.,I think 2010 can bena really interesting year,because it is the endnof the 30-year cycle,,and it's the birthdaynof the global food system.,That's the first birthdaynI want to talk about.,If we really think that this is somethingnthat's happened in the last 30 years,,there's hope in that.,It's the 30th anniversary of GMO crops,and the Big Gulp, Chicken McNuggets,nhigh-fructose corn syrup,,the farm crisis in America,and the change in how we've addressednagriculture internationally.,So there's a lot of reasonsnto take this 30-year time period,as sort of the creationnof this new food system.,I'm not the only one who's obsessednwith this whole 30-year thing.,The icons like Michael Pollannand Jamie Oliver in his TED Prize wish,both addressed this lastnthree-decade time period,as incredibly relevantnfor food system change.,Well, I really care about 1980,because it's also the 30thnanniversary of me this year.,And so in my lifetime,,a lot of what's happened in the world --,and being a person obsessed with food --,a lot of this has really changed. 
 So my second dream is that I thinknwe can look to the next 30 years,as a time to change the food system again.,And we know what's happened in the past,,so if we start nownand we look at technologies,and improvementsnto the food system long-term,,we might be ablento recreate the food system,so when I give my next talknand I'm 60 years old,,I'll be able to saynthat it's been a success.,So I'm announcing todaynthe start of a new organization,,or a new fund within the FEED Foundation,ncalled the 30 Project.,And the 30 Project is really focused,on these long-term ideasnfor food system change.,And I think by aligning internationalnadvocates that are addressing hunger,and domestic advocatesnthat are addressing obesity,,we might actually looknfor long-term solutions,that will make the food systemnbetter for everyone. 
 We all tend to thinknthat these systems are quite different,and people argue whether or notnorganic can feed the world,,but if we take a 30-year view,nthere's more hope in collaborative ideas.,So I'm hoping that by connectingnreally disparate organizations,like the ONE campaign and Slow Food,,which don't seem right nownto have much in common,,we can talk about holistic,nlong-term, systemic solutions,that will improve food for everyone.,Some ideas I've had is like,nlook, the reality is --,kids in the South Bronxnneed apples and carrots,and so do kids in Botswana.,And how are we goingnto get those kids those nutritious foods? 
 Another thing that's become incrediblynglobal is production of meat and fish.,Understanding how to produce protein,in a way that's healthynfor the environment,and healthy for people,will be incredibly importantnto address things like climate change,and how we use petrochemical fertilizers.,And, you know, these arenreally relevant topics,that are long-term and important,for both people in Africanwho are small farmers,and people in Americanwho are farmers and eaters. 
 And I also think that thinkingnabout processed foods in a new way,,where we actuallynprice the negative externalities,like petrochemicalsnand like fertilizer runoff,into the price of a bag of chips --,Well, if that bag of chips then becomesninherently more expensive than an apple,,then maybe it's time for a different sensenof personal responsibility in food choice,because the choices are actually choices,instead of three-quarters of the productsnbeing made just from corn, soy and wheat. 
 The 30Project.org is launched,and I've gathered a coalitionnof a few organizations to start.,And it'll be growingnover the next few months.,But I really hopenthat you will all think of ways,that you can look long-termnat things like the food system,and make change. 
 (Applause)So, a funny thing happened,on my way to becoming a brilliant,nworld-class neuropsychologist:,I had a baby.,And that's not to say,I ever went on to become a brilliant,nworld-class neuropsychologist.,Sorry, TED.,But I did go on to be a reasonably astute,,arguably world-class worrier.,One of my girlfriendsnin graduate school, Marie,,said, "Kim, I figured it out.,It's not that you're more neuroticnthan everyone else;,it's just that you're more honestnabout how neurotic you are." 
 So in the spirit of full disclosure,,I brought some pictures to share.,Awwww. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'll just say: July. 
 (Laughter) 
 Zip! 
 (Laughter) 
 For safety. 
 (Laughter) 
 Water wings --,an inch of water.,And then, finally, all suited up,for the 90-minute drivento Copper Mountain.,So you can get kind of a feel for this.,So my baby, Vander,nis eight years old now.,And, despite being cursednwith my athletic inability,,he plays soccer.,He's interested in playing football.,He wants to learn how to ride a unicycle. 
 So why would I worry?,Because this is what I do.nThis is what I teach.,It's what I study. It's what I treat.,And I know that kidsnget concussed every year.,In fact, more than four million peoplensustain a concussion every year,,and these data are justnamong kids under 14,who were seen in emergency rooms.,And so when kids sustain a concussion,,we talk about them getting dingednor getting their bell rung,,but what is it thatnwe're really talking about?,Let's take a look. 
 [Concussive Force] 
 "Starsky and Hutch"? Arguably, yes.,So, a car accident.,Forty miles an hour into a fixed barrier:,35 Gs.,A heavyweight boxer punchesnyou straight in the face:,58 Gs. 
 (Music) 
 In case you missed it, we'll look again.,So look to the right-handnside of the screen. 
 (Music) 
 What would you say?,How many Gs?,Close.,Seventy-two?,Would it be crazy to know:,103 Gs?,The average concussive impact,is 95 Gs.,Now, when the kidnon the right doesn't get up,,we know they've had a concussion. 
 But how about the kid on the left,,or the athlete that leavesnthe field of play?,How do we know if he or shenhas sustained a concussion?,How do we know,that legislation that would requirenthey be pulled from play,,cleared for return to play,,applies to them?,The definition of concussion,doesn't actually requirena loss of consciousness.,It requires only a changenin consciousness,,and that can be any onenor a number of symptoms,,including feeling foggy, feeling dizzy,,hearing a ringing in your ear,,being more impulsivenor hostile than usual. 
 So given all of that and givennhow darn neurotic I am,,how do I get any sleep at all?,Because I know our brains are resilient.,They're designed to recovernfrom an injury.,If -- God forbid --,any of us left here tonightnand sustained a concussion,,most of us would go on to fully recoverninside of a couple hours,to a couple of weeks.,But kids are more vulnerablento brain injury.,In fact, high-school athletesnare three times more likely,to sustain catastrophic injuries,relative even to their college-age peers,,and it takes them longernto return to a symptom-free baseline.,After that first injury,,their risk for second injurynis exponentially greater.,From there, their risk for a third injury,ngreater still, and so on. 
 And here's the really alarming part:,We don't fully understandnthe long-term impact of multiple injuries.,You guys may be familiarnwith this research,that's coming out of the NFL.,In a nutshell,nthis research suggests that,,among retired NFL playersnwith three or more career concussions,,the incidence of early-onsetndementing disease,is much greater than itnis for the general population.,So you've all seen that --nNew York Times, you've seen it.,What you may not be familiar with,is that this research was spearheadednby NFL wives who said,,"Isn't it weirdnthat my 46-year-old husband,is forever losing his keys?","Isn't it weird thatnmy 47-year-old husband,is forever losing the car?","Isn't it weird thatnmy 48-year-old husband,is forever losing his way home,in the car, from the driveway?",I may have forgotten to mentionnthat my son is an only child.,So it's going to be really important,that he be able to drivenme around someday. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, how do we guaranteenthe safety of our kids?,How can we 100 percentnguarantee the safety of our kids?,Let me tell you what I've come up with. 
 (Laughter) 
 If only.,My little boy's right there,nand he's like, "She's not kidding.,She's totally not kidding.",So in all seriousness:,Should my kid play football?,Should your kid play football?,I don't know.,But I do know there arenthree things you can do.,The first: study up.,You have to be familiar with the issuesnwe're talking about today.,There are some great resources out there. 
 The CDC has a program, HEADS UP.,It's at CDC.gov.,HEADS UP is specificnto concussion in kids.,The second is a resourcenI'm personally really proud of.,We've just rolled this outnin the last couple months --,CO Kids With Brain Injury.,This is a great resourcenfor student athletes,,teachers, parents, professionals,nathletic and coaching staff.,It's a great place to startnif you have questions. 
 The second thing is: speak up.,Just two weeks ago,,a bill introduced by Senator Kefalas,that would have requirednathletes, kids under 18,,to wear a helmetnwhen they're riding their bike,,died in committee.,It died, in large part,,because it lacked constituent buy-in;,it lacked stakeholder traction.,Now, I'm not here to tell you,what kind of legislationnyou should or shouldn't support,,but I am going to tell younthat, if it matters to you,,your legislators need to know that. 
 Speak up also with coaching staff.,Ask about what kindnof protective equipment is available.,What's the budgetnfor protective equipment?,How old it is?,Maybe offer to spearheadna fundraiser to buy new gear. 
 Which brings us to: suit up.,Wear a helmet.,The only way to prevent a bad outcome,is to prevent that first injurynfrom happening.,Recently, one of my graduatenstudents, Tom, said,,"Kim, I've decided to wear a bike helmetnon the way to class.",And Tom knows that that little bitnof foam in a bike helmet,can reduce the g-force of impact by half.,Now, I thought it was because I haventhis totally compelling helmet crusade,,this epiphany of Tom's.,As it turns out, it occurrednto Tom that a $20 helmet,is a good way to protectna $100,000 graduate education. 
 (Laughter) 
 So ...,Should Vander play football?,I can't say no,,but I can guarantee that every timenhe leaves the house,,that kid's wearing a helmet --,like, to the car,,or at school.,So whether athlete, scholar,,overprotected kid, neurotic mom,,or otherwise,,here's my baby, Vander,,reminding you,to mind your matter. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)We're here today to announce,the first synthetic cell,,a cell made by,starting with the digital code in the computer,,building the chromosome,from four bottles of chemicals,,assembling that chromosome in yeast,,transplanting it into,a recipient bacterial cell,and transforming that cell,into a new bacterial species.,So this is the first self-replicating species,that we've had on the planet,whose parent is a computer.,It also is the first species,to have its own website,encoded in its genetic code.,But we'll talk more about,the watermarks in a minute. 
 This is a project that had its inception,15 years ago,when our team then --,we called the institute TIGR --,was involved in sequencing,the first two genomes in history.,We did Haemophilus influenzae,and then the smallest genome of a self-replicating organism,,that of Mycoplasma genitalium.,And as soon as,we had these two sequences,we thought, if this is supposed to be the smallest genome,of a self-replicating species,,could there be even a smaller genome?,Could we understand the basis of cellular life,at the genetic level?,It's been a 15-year quest,just to get to the starting point now,to be able to answer those questions,,because it's very difficult to eliminate,multiple genes from a cell.,You can only do them one at a time.,We decided early on,that we had to take a synthetic route,,even though nobody had been there before,,to see if we could synthesize,a bacterial chromosome,so we could actually vary the gene content,to understand the essential genes for life.,That started our 15-year quest,to get here. 
 But before we did the first experiments,,we actually asked,Art Caplan's team at the University of Pennsylvania,to undertake a review,of what the risks, the challenges,,the ethics around creating new,species in the laboratory were,because it hadn't been done before.,They spent about two years,reviewing that independently,and published their results in Science in 1999.,Ham and I took two years off,as a side project to sequence the human genome,,but as soon as that was done,we got back to the task at hand. 
 In 2002, we started,a new institute,,the Institute for Biological Energy Alternatives,,where we set out two goals:,One, to understand,the impact of our technology on the environment,,and how to understand the environment better,,and two, to start down this process,of making synthetic life,to understand basic life.,In 2003,,we published our first success.,So Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison,developed some new methods,for making error-free DNA,at a small level.,Our first task was,a 5,000-letter code bacteriophage,,a virus that attacks only E. coli.,So that was,the phage phi X 174,,which was chosen for historical reasons.,It was the first DNA phage,,DNA virus, DNA genome,that was actually sequenced.,So once we realized,that we could make 5,000-base pair,viral-sized pieces,,we thought, we at least have the means,then to try and make serially lots of these pieces,to be able to eventually assemble them together,to make this mega base chromosome.,So, substantially larger than,we even thought we would go initially. 
 There were several steps to this. There were two sides:,We had to solve the chemistry,for making large DNA molecules,,and we had to solve the biological side,of how, if we had this new chemical entity,,how would we boot it up, activate it,in a recipient cell.,We had two teams working in parallel:,one team on the chemistry,,and the other on trying to,be able to transplant,entire chromosomes,to get new cells.,When we started this out, we thought the synthesis would be the biggest problem,,which is why we chose the smallest genome. 
 And some of you have noticed that we switched from the smallest genome,to a much larger one.,And we can walk through the reasons for that,,but basically the small cell,took on the order of,one to two months to get results from,,whereas the larger, faster-growing cell,takes only two days.,So there's only so many cycles we could go through,in a year at six weeks per cycle.,And you should know that basically,99, probably 99 percent plus,of our experiments failed.,So this was a debugging,,problem-solving scenario from the beginning,because there was no recipe,of how to get there. 
 So, one of the most important publications we had,was in 2007.,Carole Lartigue led the effort,to actually transplant a bacterial chromosome,from one bacteria to another.,I think philosophically, that was one of the most important papers,that we've ever done,because it showed how dynamic life was.,And we knew, once that worked,,that we actually had a chance,if we could make the synthetic chromosomes,to do the same with those.,We didn't know that it was going to take us,several years more to get there. 
 In 2008,,we reported the complete synthesis,of the Mycoplasma genitalium genome,,a little over 500,000 letters of genetic code,,but we have not yet succeeded in booting up that chromosome.,We think in part, because of its slow growth,and, in part,,cells have all kinds of unique defense mechanisms,to keep these events from happening.,It turned out the cell that we were trying to transplant into,had a nuclease, an enzyme that chews up DNA on its surface,,and was happy to eat,the synthetic DNA that we gave it,and never got transplantations.,But at the time, that was the largest,molecule of a defined structure,that had been made. 
 And so both sides were progressing,,but part of the synthesis,had to be accomplished or was able to be accomplished,using yeast, putting the fragments in yeast,and yeast would assemble these for us.,It's an amazing step forward,,but we had a problem because now we had,the bacterial chromosomes growing in yeast.,So in addition to doing the transplant,,we had to find out how to get a bacterial chromosome,out of the eukaryotic yeast,into a form where we could transplant it,into a recipient cell. 
 So our team developed new techniques,for actually growing, cloning,entire bacterial chromosomes in yeast.,So we took the same mycoides genome,that Carole had initially transplanted,,and we grew that in yeast,as an artificial chromosome.,And we thought this would be a great test bed,for learning how to get chromosomes out of yeast,and transplant them.,When we did these experiments, though,,we could get the chromosome out of yeast,but it wouldn't transplant and boot up a cell.,That little issue took the team two years to solve. 
 It turns out, the DNA in the bacterial cell,was actually methylated,,and the methylation protects it from the restriction enzyme,,from digesting the DNA.,So what we found is if we took the chromosome,out of yeast and methylated it,,we could then transplant it.,Further advances came,when the team removed the restriction enzyme genes,from the recipient capricolum cell.,And once we had done that, now we can take,naked DNA out of yeast and transplant it. 
 So last fall,when we published the results of that work in Science,,we all became overconfident,and were sure we were only,a few weeks away,from being able to now boot up,a chromosome out of yeast.,Because of the problems with,Mycoplasma genitalium and its slow growth,about a year and a half ago,,we decided to synthesize,the much larger chromosome, the mycoides chromosome,,knowing that we had the biology worked out on that,for transplantation.,And Dan led the team for the synthesis,of this over one-million-base pair chromosome.,But it turned out it wasn't going to be as simple in the end,,and it set us back three months,because we had one error,out of over a million base pairs in that sequence. 
 So the team developed new debugging software,,where we could test each synthetic fragment,to see if it would grow in a background,of wild type DNA.,And we found that 10 out of the 11,100,000-base pair pieces we synthesized,were completely accurate,and compatible with,a life-forming sequence.,We narrowed it down to one fragment;,we sequenced it,and found just one base pair had been deleted,in an essential gene.,So accuracy is essential.,There's parts of the genome,where it cannot tolerate even a single error,,and then there's parts of the genome,where we can put in large blocks of DNA,,as we did with the watermarks,,and it can tolerate all kinds of errors.,So it took about three months to find that error,and repair it.,And then early one morning, at 6 a.m.,we got a text from Dan,saying that, now, the first blue colonies existed. 
 So, it's been a long route to get here:,15 years from the beginning.,We felt,one of the tenets of this field,was to make absolutely certain,we could distinguish synthetic DNA,from natural DNA.,Early on, when you're working in a new area of science,,you have to think about all the pitfalls,and things that could lead you,to believe that you had done something when you hadn't,,and, even worse, leading others to believe it.,So, we thought the worst problem would be,a single molecule contamination,of the native chromosome,,leading us to believe that we actually had,created a synthetic cell,,when it would have been just a contaminant. 
 So early on, we developed the notion,of putting in watermarks in the DNA,to absolutely make clear,that the DNA was synthetic.,And the first chromosome we built,in 2008 --,the 500,000-base pair one --,we simply assigned,the names of the authors of the chromosome,into the genetic code,,but it was using just amino acid,single letter translations,,which leaves out certain letters of the alphabet.,So the team actually developed a new code,within the code within the code.,So it's a new code,for interpreting and writing messages in DNA.,Now, mathematicians have been hiding and writing,messages in the genetic code for a long time,,but it's clear they were mathematicians and not biologists,because, if you write long messages,with the code that the mathematicians developed,,it would more than likely lead to,new proteins being synthesized,with unknown functions. 
 So the code that Mike Montague and the team developed,actually puts frequent stop codons,,so it's a different alphabet,but allows us to use,the entire English alphabet,with punctuation and numbers.,So, there are four major watermarks,all over 1,000 base pairs of genetic code.,The first one actually contains within it,this code for interpreting,the rest of the genetic code.,So in the remaining information,,in the watermarks,,contain the names of, I think it's,46 different authors,and key contributors,to getting the project to this stage.,And we also built in,a website address,so that if somebody decodes the code,within the code within the code,,they can send an email to that address.,So it's clearly distinguishable,from any other species,,having 46 names in it,,its own web address.,And we added three quotations,,because with the first genome,we were criticized for not trying to say something more profound,than just signing the work. 
 So we won't give the rest of the code,,but we will give the three quotations.,The first is,,"To live, to err,,to fall, to triumph,and to recreate life out of life.",It's a James Joyce quote.,The second quotation is, "See things not as they are,,but as they might be.",It's a quote from the "American Prometheus",book on Robert Oppenheimer.,And the last one is a Richard Feynman quote:,"What I cannot build,,I cannot understand.",So, because this is as much a philosophical advance,as a technical advance in science,,we tried to deal with both the philosophical,and the technical side. 
 The last thing I want to say before turning it over to questions,is that the extensive work,that we've done --,asking for ethical review,,pushing the envelope,on that side as well as the technical side --,this has been broadly discussed in the scientific community,,in the policy community,and at the highest levels of the federal government.,Even with this announcement,,as we did in 2003 --,that work was funded by the Department of Energy,,so the work was reviewed,at the level of the White House,,trying to decide whether to classify the work or publish it.,And they came down on the side of open publication,,which is the right approach --,we've briefed the White House,,we've briefed members of Congress,,we've tried to take and push,the policy issues,in parallel with the scientific advances. 
 So with that, I would like,to open it first to the floor for questions.,Yes, in the back. 
 Reporter: Could you explain, in layman's terms,,how significant a breakthrough this is please? 
 Craig Venter: Can we explain how significant this is?,I'm not sure we're the ones that should be explaining how significant it is.,It's significant to us.,Perhaps it's a giant philosophical change,in how we view life.,We actually view it as a baby step in terms of,,it's taken us 15 years to be able,to do the experiment,we wanted to do 15 years ago,on understanding life at its basic level.,But we actually believe,this is going to be a very powerful set of tools,and we're already starting,in numerous avenues,to use this tool. 
 We have, at the Institute,,ongoing funding now from NIH,in a program with Novartis,to try and use these new,synthetic DNA tools,to perhaps make the flu vaccine,that you might get next year.,Because instead of taking weeks to months to make these,,Dan's team can now make these,in less than 24 hours.,So when you see how long it took to get an H1N1 vaccine out,,we think we can shorten that process,quite substantially.,In the vaccine area,,Synthetic Genomics and the Institute,are forming a new vaccine company,because we think these tools can affect vaccines,to diseases that haven't been possible to date,,things where the viruses rapidly evolve,,such with rhinovirus.,Wouldn't it be nice to have something that actually blocked common colds?,Or, more importantly, HIV,,where the virus evolves so quickly,the vaccines that are made today,can't keep up,with those evolutionary changes. 
 Also, at Synthetic Genomics,,we've been working,on major environmental issues.,I think this latest oil spill in the Gulf,is a reminder.,We can't see CO2 --,we depend on scientific measurements for it,and we see the beginning results,of having too much of it --,but we can see pre-CO2 now,floating on the waters,and contaminating the beaches in the Gulf.,We need some alternatives,for oil.,We have a program with Exxon Mobile,to try and develop new strains of algae,that can efficiently capture carbon dioxide,from the atmosphere or from concentrated sources,,make new hydrocarbons that can go into their refineries,to make normal gasoline,and diesel fuel out of CO2. 
 Those are just a couple of the approaches,and directions that we're taking. 
 (Applause)So today I'm going to talk to you,about the rise of collaborative consumption.,I'm going to explain what it is,and try and convince you -- in just 15 minutes --,that this isn't a flimsy idea,,or a short-term trend,,but a powerful cultural and economic force,reinventing not just what we consume,,but how we consume. 
 Now I'm going to start with a deceptively simple example.,Hands up -- how many of you,have books, CDs, DVDs, or videos,lying around your house,that you probably won't use again,,but you can't quite bring yourself to throw away?,Can't see all the hands,,but it looks like all of you, right?,On our shelves at home,,we have a box set of the DVD series "24,",season six to be precise.,I think it was bought for us around three years ago for a Christmas present.,Now my husband, Chris, and I,love this show.,But let's face it, when you've watched it once maybe, or twice,,you don't really want to watch it again,,because you know how Jack Bauer is going to defeat the terrorists.,So there it sits on our shelves,obsolete to us,,but with immediate latent value to someone else.,Now before we go on, I have a confession to make.,I lived in New York for 10 years,,and I am a big fan of "Sex and the City.",Now I'd love to watch the first movie again,as sort of a warm-up to the sequel coming out next week.,So how easily could I swap,our unwanted copy of "24",for a wanted copy of "Sex and the City?",Now you may have noticed,there's a new sector emerging called swap-trading.,Now the easiest analogy for swap-trading,is like an online dating service,for all your unwanted media.,What it does is use the Internet,to create an infinite marketplace,to match person A's "haves",with person C's "wants,",whatever they may be. 
 The other week, I went on one of these sites,,appropriately called Swaptree,,and there were over 59,300 items,that I could instantly swap,for my copy of "24.",Lo and behold,,there in Reseda, CA was Rondoron,who wanted swap his or her,"like new" copy of "Sex and the City",for my copy of "24.",So in other words, what's happening here,is that Swaptree,solves my carrying company's sugar rush problem,,a problem the economists call "the coincidence of wants,",in approximately 60 seconds.,What's even more amazing is it will print out a postage label on the spot,,because it knows the way of the item.,Now there are layers of technical wonder,behind sites such as Swaptree,,but that's not my interest,,and nor is swap trading, per se. 
 My passion, and what I've spent the last few years,dedicated to researching,,is the collaborative behaviors and trust-mechanics,inherent in these systems.,When you think about it,,it would have seemed like a crazy idea, even a few years ago,,that I would swap my stuff with a total stranger,whose real name I didn't know,and without any money changing hands.,Yet 99 percent of trades on Swaptree,happen successfully,,and the one percent that receive a negative rating,,it's for relatively minor reasons,,like the item didn't arrive on time. 
 So what's happening here?,An extremely powerful dynamic,that has huge commercial and cultural implications,is at play.,Namely, that technology,is enabling,trust between strangers.,We now live in a global village,where we can mimic the ties,that used to happen face to face,,but on a scale and in ways,that have never been possible before.,So what's actually happening,is that social networks and real-time technologies,are taking us back.,We're bartering, trading,,swapping, sharing,,but they're being reinvented,into dynamic and appealing forms.,What I find fascinating,is that we've actually wired our world to share,,whether that's our neighborhood, our school,,our office, or our Facebook network,,and that's creating an economy,of "what's mine is yours.",From the mighty eBay,,the grandfather of exchange marketplaces,,to car-sharing companies such as GoGet,,where you pay a monthly fee to rent cars by the hour,,to social lending platforms such as Zopa,,that will take anyone in this audience,with 100 dollars to lend,,and match them with a borrower anywhere in the world,,we're sharing and collaborating again,in ways that I believe,are more hip than hippie.,I call this "groundswell collaborative consumption." 
 Now before I dig into the different systems,of collaborative consumption,,I'd like to try and answer the question,that every author rightfully gets asked,,which is, where did this idea come from?,Now I'd like to say I woke up one morning,and said, "I'm going to write about collaborative consumption,",but actually it was a complicated web,of seemingly disconnected ideas.,Over the next minute,,you're going to see a bit like a conceptual fireworks display,of all the dots that went on in my head.,The first thing I began to notice:,how many big concepts were emerging --,from the wisdom of crowds to smart mobs --,around how ridiculously easy it is,to form groups for a purpose.,And linked to this crowd mania,were examples all around the world --,from the election of a president,to the infamous Wikipedia, and everything in between --,on what the power of numbers could achieve. 
 Now, you know when you learn a new word,,and then you start to see that word everywhere?,That's what happened to me,when I noticed that we are moving,from passive consumers,to creators,,to highly enabled collaborators.,What's happening,is the Internet is removing the middleman,,so that anyone from a T-shirt designer,to a knitter,can make a living selling peer-to-peer.,And the ubiquitous force,of this peer-to-peer revolution,means that sharing is happening at phenomenal rates.,I mean, it's amazing to think,that, in every single minute of this speech,,25 hours,of YouTube video will be loaded.,Now what I find fascinating about these examples,is how they're actually tapping into,our primate instincts.,I mean, we're monkeys,,and we're born and bred to share and cooperate.,And we were doing so for thousands of years,,whether it's when we hunted in packs,,or farmed in cooperatives,,before this big system called hyper-consumption came along,and we built these fences,and created out own little fiefdoms.,But things are changing,,and one of the reasons why,is the digital natives, or Gen-Y.,They're growing up sharing --,files, video games, knowledge.,It's second nature to them.,So we, the millennials -- I am just a millennial --,are like foot soldiers,,moving us from a culture of "me" to a culture of "we." 
 The reason why it's happening so fast,is because of mobile collaboration.,We now live in a connected age,where we can locate anyone, anytime, in real-time,,from a small device in our hands.,All of this was going through my head,towards the end of 2008,,when, of course, the great financial crash happened.,Thomas Friedman is one of my favorite New York Times columnists,,and he poignantly commented,that 2008 is when we hit a wall,,when Mother Nature and the market,both said, "No more.",Now we rationally know,that an economy built on hyper-consumption,is a Ponzi scheme. It's a house of cards.,Yet, it's hard for us to individually know what to do. 
 So all of this is a lot of twittering, right?,Well it was a lot of noise and complexity in my head,,until actually I realized it was happening,because of four key drivers.,One, a renewed belief in the importance of community,,and a very redefinition of what friend and neighbor really means.,A torrent of peer-to-peer social networks,and real-time technologies,,fundamentally changing the way we behave.,Three, pressing unresolved environmental concerns.,And four, a global recession,that has fundamentally shocked,consumer behaviors.,These four drivers,are fusing together,and creating the big shift --,away from the 20th century,,defined by hyper-consumption,,towards the 21st century,,defined by collaborative consumption.,I generally believe we're at an inflection point,where the sharing behaviors --,through sites such as Flickr and Twitter,that are becoming second nature online --,are being applied to offline areas of our everyday lives.,From morning commutes to the way fashion is designed,to the way we grow food,,we are consuming and collaborating once again. 
 So my co-author, Roo Rogers, and I,have actually gathered thousands of examples,from all around the world of collaborative consumption.,And although they vary enormously,in scale, maturity and purpose,,when we dived into them,,we realized that they could actually be organized into three clear systems.,The first is redistribution markets.,Redistribution markets, just like Swaptree,,are when you take a used, or pre-owned, item,and move it from where it's not needed,to somewhere, or someone, where it is.,They're increasingly thought of as the fifth 'R' --,reduce, reuse, recycle, repair,and redistribute --,because they stretch the life cycle of a product,and thereby reduce waste. 
 The second is collaborative lifestyles.,This is the sharing of resources,of things like money, skills and time.,I bet, in a couple of years,,that phrases like "coworking",and "couchsurfing" and "time banks",are going to become a part of everyday vernacular.,One of my favorite examples of collaborative lifestyles,is called Landshare.,It's a scheme in the U.K.,that matches Mr. Jones,,with some spare space in his back garden,,with Mrs. Smith, a would-be grower.,Together they grow their own food.,It's one of those ideas that's so simple, yet brilliant,,you wonder why it's never been done before. 
 Now, the third system,is product-service systems.,This is where you pay for the benefit of the product --,what it does for you --,without needing to own the product outright.,This idea is particularly powerful,for things that have,high-idling capacity.,And that can be anything from baby goods,to fashions to --,how many of you have a power drill,,own a power drill? Right.,That power drill will be used around 12 to 13 minutes,in its entire lifetime.,(Laughter),It's kind of ridiculous, right?,Because what you need is the hole, not the drill.,(Laughter),(Applause),So why don't you rent the drill,,or, even better, rent out your own drill to other people,and make some money from it?,These three systems are coming together,,allowing people to share resources,without sacrificing their lifestyles,,or their cherished personal freedoms.,I'm not asking people,to share nicely in the sandpit. 
 So I want to just give you an example,of how powerful collaborative consumption can be,to change behaviors.,The average car,costs 8,000 dollars a year to run.,Yet, that car sits idle,for 23 hours a day.,So when you consider these two facts,,it starts to make a little less sense,that we have to own one outright.,So this is where car-sharing companies,such as Zipcar and GoGet come in.,In 2009,,Zipcar took 250 participants,from across 13 cities --,and they're all self-confessed car addicts,and car-sharing rookies --,and got them to surrender their keys for a month.,Instead, these people had to walk,,bike, take the train,,or other forms of public transport.,They could only use their Zipcar membership,when absolutely necessary.,The results of this challenge after just one month,was staggering.,It's amazing that 413 lbs were lost,just from the extra exercise.,But my favorite statistic,is that 100,out of the 250 participants,did not want their keys back.,In other words, the car addicts,had lost their urge to own. 
 Now products-service systems have been around for years.,Just think of libraries and laundrettes.,But I think they're entering a new age,,because technology makes sharing,frictionless and fun.,There's a great quote that was written in the New York Times,that said, "Sharing is to ownership,what the iPod is to the 8-track,,what solar power is to the coal mine.",I believe also, our generation,,our relationship to satisfying what we want,is far less tangible,than any other previous generation.,I don't want the DVD; I want the movie it carries.,I don't want a clunky answering machine;,I want the message it saves.,I don't want a CD; I want the music it plays.,In other words, I don't want stuff;,I want the needs or experiences it fulfills.,This is fueling a massive shift,from where usage trumps possessions --,or as Kevin Kelly, the editor of Wired magazine, puts it,,"where access is better than ownership." 
 Now as our possessions,dematerialize into the cloud,,a blurry line is appearing,between what's mine, what's yours,,and what's ours.,I want to give you one example,that shows how fast this evolution is happening.,This represents an eight-year time span.,We've gone from traditional car-ownership,to car-sharing companies, such as Zipcar and GoGet,,to ride-sharing platforms that match rides,to the newest entry, which is peer-to-peer car rental,,where you can actually make money,out of renting that car that sits idle for 23 hours a day,to your neighbor.,Now all of these systems,require a degree of trust,,and the cornerstone to this working,is reputation. 
 Now in the old consumer system,,our reputation didn't matter so much,,because our credit history was far more important,that any kind of peer-to-peer review.,But now with the Web, we leave a trail.,With every spammer we flag,,with every idea we post, comment we share,,we're actually signaling how well we collaborate,,and whether we can or can't be trusted.,Let's go back to my first example,,Swaptree.,I can see that Rondoron,has completed 553 trades,with a 100 percent success rate.,In other words, I can trust him or her.,Now mark my words,,it's only a matter of time,before we're going to be able to perform a Google-like search,and see a cumulative picture,of our reputation capital.,And this reputation capital,will determine our access to collaborative consumption.,It's a new social currency, so to speak,,that could become as powerful as our credit rating. 
 Now as a closing thought,,I believe we're actually in a period,where we're waking up,from this humongous hangover,of emptiness and waste,,and we're taking a leap,to create a more sustainable system,built to serve our innate needs,for community and individual identity.,I believe it will be referred to,as a revolution, so to speak --,when society, faced with great challenges,,made a seismic shift,from individual getting and spending,towards a rediscovery of collective good.,I'm on a mission to make sharing cool.,I'm on a mission to make sharing hip.,Because I really believe,it can disrupt outdated modes of business,,help us leapfrog,over wasteful forms of hyper-consumption,and teach us when enough really is enough. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)What I thought I would do,is I would start with a simple request.,I'd like all of you,to pause for a moment,,you wretched weaklings,,and take stock of your miserable existence.,(Laughter) 
 Now that was the advice,that St. Benedict gave his rather startled followers,in the fifth century.,It was the advice that I decided to follow myself,when I turned 40.,Up until that moment, I had been that classic corporate warrior --,I was eating too much, I was drinking too much,,I was working too hard,and I was neglecting the family.,And I decided that I would try,and turn my life around.,In particular, I decided,I would try to address the thorny issue,of work-life balance.,So I stepped back from the workforce,,and I spent a year at home,with my wife and four young children.,But all I learned about work-life balance,from that year,was that I found it quite easy,to balance work and life,when I didn't have any work.,(Laughter),Not a very useful skill,,especially when the money runs out. 
 So I went back to work,,and I've spent these seven years since,struggling with, studying,and writing about work-life balance.,And I have four observations,I'd like to share with you today.,The first is:,if society's to make any progress on this issue,,we need an honest debate.,But the trouble is,so many people talk so much rubbish,about work-life balance.,All the discussions about flexi-time,or dress-down Fridays,or paternity leave,only serve to mask the core issue,,which is,that certain job and career choices,are fundamentally incompatible,with being meaningfully engaged,on a day-to-day basis,with a young family.,Now the first step in solving any problem,is acknowledging the reality of the situation you're in.,And the reality of the society that we're in,is there are thousands and thousands,of people out there,leading lives of quiet, screaming desperation,,where they work long, hard hours,at jobs they hate,to enable them to buy things they don't need,to impress people they don't like.,(Laughter),(Applause),It's my contention that going to work on Friday in jeans and [a] T-shirt,isn't really getting to the nub of the issue. 
 (Laughter) 
 The second observation I'd like to make,is we need to face the truth,that governments and corporations,aren't going to solve this issue for us.,We should stop looking outside.,It's up to us as individuals,to take control and responsibility,for the type of lives that we want to lead.,If you don't design your life,,someone else will design it for you,,and you may just not like,their idea of balance.,It's particularly important --,this isn't on the World Wide Web, is it? I'm about to get fired --,it's particularly important,that you never put the quality of your life,in the hands of a commercial corporation.,Now I'm not talking here just about the bad companies --,the "abattoirs of the human soul," as I call them.,(Laughter),I'm talking about all companies.,Because commercial companies,are inherently designed,to get as much out of you [as],they can get away with.,It's in their nature; it's in their DNA;,it's what they do --,even the good, well-intentioned companies.,On the one hand,,putting childcare facilities in the workplace,is wonderful and enlightened.,On the other hand, it's a nightmare --,it just means you spend more time at the bloody office.,We have to be responsible,for setting and enforcing,the boundaries that we want in our life. 
 The third observation is,we have to be careful,with the time frame that we choose,upon which to judge our balance.,Before I went back to work,after my year at home,,I sat down,and I wrote out,a detailed, step-by-step description,of the ideal balanced day,that I aspired to.,And it went like this:,wake up well rested,after a good night's sleep.,Have sex.,Walk the dog.,Have breakfast with my wife and children.,Have sex again.,(Laughter),Drive the kids to school on the way to the office.,Do three hours' work.,Play a sport with a friend at lunchtime.,Do another three hours' work.,Meet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink.,Drive home for dinner,with my wife and kids.,Meditate for half an hour.,Have sex.,Walk the dog. Have sex again.,Go to bed.,(Applause),How often do you think I have that day?,(Laughter),We need to be realistic.,You can't do it all in one day.,We need to elongate the time frame,upon which we judge the balance in our life,,but we need to elongate it,without falling into the trap,of the "I'll have a life when I retire,,when my kids have left home,,when my wife has divorced me, my health is failing,,I've got no mates or interests left.",(Laughter),A day is too short; "after I retire" is too long.,There's got to be a middle way. 
 A fourth observation:,We need to approach balance,in a balanced way.,A friend came to see me last year --,and she doesn't mind me telling this story -- a friend came to see me last year,and said, "Nigel, I've read your book.,And I realize that my life is completely out of balance.,It's totally dominated by work.,I work 10 hours a day; I commute two hours a day.,All of my relationships have failed.,There's nothing in my life,apart from my work.,So I've decided to get a grip and sort it out.,So I joined a gym.",(Laughter),Now I don't mean to mock,,but being a fit 10-hour-a-day office rat,isn't more balanced; it's more fit.,(Laughter),Lovely though physical exercise may be,,there are other parts to life --,there's the intellectual side; there's the emotional side;,there's the spiritual side.,And to be balanced,,I believe we have to attend,to all of those areas --,not just do 50 stomach crunches. 
 Now that can be daunting.,Because people say, "Bloody hell mate, I haven't got time to get fit.,You want me to go to church and call my mother.",And I understand.,I truly understand how that can be daunting.,But an incident that happened a couple of years ago,gave me a new perspective.,My wife, who is somewhere in the audience today,,called me up at the office,and said, "Nigel, you need to pick our youngest son" --,Harry -- "up from school.",Because she had to be somewhere else with the other three children for that evening.,So I left work an hour early that afternoon,and picked Harry up at the school gates.,We walked down to the local park,,messed around on the swings, played some silly games.,I then walked him up the hill to the local cafe,,and we shared a pizza for two,,then walked down the hill to our home,,and I gave him his bath,and put him in his Batman pajamas.,I then read him a chapter,of Roald Dahl's "James and the Giant Peach.",I then put him to bed, tucked him in,,gave him a kiss on his forehead and said, "Goodnight, mate,",and walked out of his bedroom.,As I was walking out of his bedroom,,he said, "Dad?" I went, "Yes, mate?",He went, "Dad, this has been the best day,of my life, ever.",I hadn't done anything,,hadn't taken him to Disney World or bought him a Playstation. 
 Now my point is,the small things matter.,Being more balanced,doesn't mean dramatic upheaval in your life.,With the smallest investment,in the right places,,you can radically transform the quality of your relationships,and the quality of your life.,Moreover, I think,,it can transform society.,Because if enough people do it,,we can change society's definition of success,away from the moronically simplistic notion,that the person with the most money when he dies wins,,to a more thoughtful and balanced definition,of what a life well lived looks like.,And that, I think,,is an idea worth spreading. 
 (Applause)(Whistling) 
 (Whistling ends) 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you very much.,That was whistling.,I'm trying to do this in English.,What is a chubby,ncurly-haired guy from Holland --,why is he whistling?,Well actually, I've been whistlingnsince the age of four, about four.,My dad was always whistlingnaround the house,,and I just thought that's partnof communication in my family.,So I whistled along with him.,And actually, until I was 34,,I always annoyed and irritatednpeople with whistling,,because, to be honest,,my whistling is a kindnof deviant behavior.,I whistled alone,nI whistled in the classroom,,I whistled on bike, I whistled everywhere. 
 And I also whistlednat a Christmas Eve party,with my family-in-law.,And they had some, in my opinion,nterrible Christmas music.,And when I hear music that I don't like,nI try to make it better. 
 (Laughter) 
 So when "Rudolph the Red-NosednReindeer" -- you know it? 
 (Whistling) 
 But it can also sound like this. 
 (Whistling) 
 But during a Christmas party --,at dinner, actually -- it's very annoying.,So my sister-in-law asked me a few times,n"Please stop whistling.",And I just couldn't.,And at one point --,and I had some wine,nI have to admit that --,at one point I said,n"If there was a contest, I would join." 
 And two weeks later,,I received a text message:n"You're going to America." 
 (Laughter) 
 So, OK, I'm going to America.,I would love to, but why?,So I immediately called her up, of course.,She googled, and she foundnthis World Whistling Championship,in America, of course. 
 (Laughter) 
 She didn't expect me to go there.,And I would have lost my face.,I don't know if that's correct English.,But the Dutch people herenwill understand what I mean. 
 (Laughter) 
 I lost my face. 
 (Applause) 
 And she thought, "He will never go there.",But actually, I did.,So I went to Louisburg, North Carolina,nsoutheast of the United States,,and I entered the world of whistling.,And I also entered the World Championship,,and I won there, in 2004. 
 (Applause) 
 That was great fun, of course.,And to defend my title --nlike judokas do and sportsmen --,I thought, well let's go back in 2005 --,and I won again. 
 (Laughter) 
 Then I couldn't participatenfor a few years.,And in 2008, I entered againnin Japan, Tokyo, and I won again.,So what happened now,is I'm standing here in Rotterdam,nin the beautiful city, on a big stage,,and I'm talking about whistling.,And actually, I earn my moneynwhistling, at the moment.,So I quit my day job as a nurse. 
 (Applause) 
 And I try to live my dream --,well, actually, it was never my dream,nbut it sounds so good. 
 (Laughter) 
 OK, I'm not the only one whistling here.,You say, "Huh, what do you mean?",Well actually, you are goingnto whistle along.,And then always the same thing happens:,people are watching each othernand think, "Oh, my God.,Why? Can I go away?",No, you can't. 
 (Laughter) 
 Actually, it's very simple.,The track that I will whistlenis called "Fête de la Belle.",It's about 80 minutes long. 
 (Laughter) 
 No, no, no. It's four minutes long.,And I want to first rehearsenwith you your whistling.,Yes, so I whistle the tone. 
 (Whistling) 
 (Laughter) 
 Sorry, I forgot one thing --,you whistle the same tone as me. 
 (Laughter) 
 I heard a wide variety of tones. 
 (Geert Chatrou and audience whistling) 
 (Whistling ends) 
 This is very promising. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is very promising.,I'll ask the techniciansnto start the music.,And if it's started,nI just point where you whistle along,,and we will see what happens. 
 (Laughter) 
 Oh, I'm so sorry, technicians. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm so used to that. 
 (Laughter) 
 I start it myself. 
 (Laughter) 
 OK, here it is. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Music) 
 (Whistling) 
 (Whistling ends) 
 (Music) 
 OK. 
 (Whistling) 
 It's easy, isn't it? 
 (Whistling) 
 Now comes the solo,nI propose I do that myself, OK? 
 (Music) 
 (Whistling) 
 (Applause) 
 Max Westerman: Geert Chatrou,nthe World Champion of Whistling. 
 Geert Chatrou: Thank you. Thank you.I'm here today to share with you,an extraordinary journey -,extraordinarily rewarding journey,nactually -,which brought me into,training rats,to save human lives,by detecting landmines,and tuberculosis.,As a child, I had two passions.,One was a passion for rodents.,I had all kinds of rats,,mice, hamsters,,gerbils, squirrels.,You name it, I bred it, and I sold them to pet shops.,(Laughter),I also had a passion for Africa.,Growing up in a multicultural environment,,we had African students in the house,,and I learned about their stories,,so different backgrounds,,dependency on imported know-how,,goods, services,,exuberant cultural diversity.,Africa was truly fascinating for me. 
 I became an industrial engineer,,engineer in product development,,and I focused on appropriate detection technologies,,actually the first appropriate technologies,for developing countries.,I started working in the industry,,but I wasn't really happy to contribute,to a material consumer society,in a linear, extracting,and manufacturing mode.,I quit my job to focus on the real world problem:,landmines.,We're talking '95 now.,Princess Diana is announcing on TV,that landmines form a structural barrier,to any development, which is really true.,As long as these devices are there,,or there is suspicion of landmines,,you can't really enter into the land.,Actually, there was an appeal worldwide,for new detectors,sustainable in the environments,where they're needed to produce,,which is mainly in the developing world.,We chose rats. 
 Why would you choose rats?,Because, aren't they vermin?,Well, actually rats are,,in contrary to what most people think about them,,rats are highly sociable creatures.,And actually, our product -- what you see here.,There's a target somewhere here.,You see an operator, a trained African,with his rats in front,who actually are left and right.,There, the animal finds a mine.,It scratches on the soil.,And the animal comes back for a food reward.,Very, very simple.,Very sustainable in this environment.,Here, the animal gets its food reward.,And that's how it works.,Very, very simple. 
 Now why would you use rats?,Rats have been used since the '50s last century,,in all kinds of experiments.,Rats have more genetic material,allocated to olfaction,than any other mammal species.,They're extremely sensitive to smell.,Moreover, they have the mechanisms to map all these smells,and to communicate about it.,Now how do we communicate with rats?,Well don't talk rat,,but we have a clicker,,a standard method for animal training,,which you see there.,A clicker, which makes a particular sound,with which you can reinforce particular behaviors.,First of all, we associate the click sound with a food reward,,which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe.,Once the animal knows click, food,,click, food, click, food --,so click is food --,we bring it in a cage with a hole,,and actually the animal learns,to stick the nose in the hole,under which a target scent is placed,,and to do that for five seconds --,five seconds, which is long for a rat.,Once the animal knows this, we make the task a bit more difficult.,It learns how to find the target smell,in a cage with several holes, up to 10 holes. 
 Then the animal learns,to walk on a leash in the open,and find targets.,In the next step, animals learn,to find real mines in real minefields.,They are tested and accredited,according to International Mine Action Standards,,just like dogs have to pass a test.,This consists of 400 square meters.,There's a number of mines,placed blindly,,and the team of trainer and their rat,have to find all the targets.,If the animal does that, it gets a license,as an accredited animal,to be operational in the field --,just like dogs, by the way.,Maybe one slight difference:,we can train rats at a fifth of the price,of training the mining dog. 
 This is our team in Mozambique:,one Tanzanian trainer,,who transfers the skills,to these three Mozambican fellows.,And you should see the pride in the eyes of these people.,They have a skill,,which makes them much less dependent,on foreign aid.,Moreover, this small team,together with, of course, you need the heavy vehicles,and the manual de-miners to follow-up.,But with this small investment in a rat capacity,,we have demonstrated in Mozambique,that we can reduce the cost-price per square meter,up to 60 percent,of what is currently normal --,two dollars per square meter, we do it at $1.18,,and we can still bring that price down.,Question of scale.,If you can bring in more rats,,we can actually make the output even bigger.,We have a demonstration site in Mozambique.,Eleven African governments,have seen that they can become less dependent,by using this technology.,They have signed the pact for peace,and treaty in the Great Lakes region,,and they endorse hero rats,to clear their common borders of landmines. 
 But let me bring you to a very different problem.,And there's about 6,000 people last year,that walked on a landmine,,but worldwide last year,,almost 1.9 million died from tuberculosis,as a first cause of infection.,Especially in Africa,where T.B. and HIV are strongly linked,,there is a huge common problem.,Microscopy, the standard WHO procedure,,reaches from 40 to 60 percent reliability.,In Tanzania -- the numbers don't lie --,45 percent of people -- T.B. patients --,get diagnosed with T.B. before they die.,It means that, if you have T.B.,,you have more chance that you won't be detected,,but will just die from T.B. secondary infections and so on.,And if, however,,you are detected very early, diagnosed early,,treatment can start,,and even in HIV-positives, it makes sense.,You can actually cure T.B.,,even in HIV-positives. 
 So in our common language, Dutch,,the name for T.B.,is "tering,",which, etymologically,,refers to the smell of tar.,Already the old Chinese,and the Greek, Hippocrates,,have actually published,,documented, that T.B. can be diagnosed,based on the volatiles,exuding from patients.,So what we did is we collected some samples --,just as a way of testing --,from hospitals,,trained rats on them,and see if this works,,and wonder, well,,we can reach 89 percent sensitivity,,86 percent specificity,using multiple rats in a row.,This is how it works,,and really, this is a generic technology.,We're talking now explosives, tuberculosis,,but can you imagine,,you can actually put anything under there. 
 So how does it work?,You have a cassette with 10 samples.,You put these 10 samples at once in the cage.,An animal only needs two hundredths of a second,to discriminate the scent, so it goes extremely fast.,Here it's already at the third sample.,This is a positive sample.,It gets a click sound and comes for the food reward.,And by doing so, very fast,,we can have like a second-line opinion,to see which patients are positive,,which are negative.,Just as an indication,,whereas a microscopist can process,40 samples in a day,,a rat can process,the same amount of samples,in seven minutes only.,A cage like this --,(Applause),A cage like this -- provided that you have rats,,and we have now currently,25 tuberculosis rats --,a cage like this, operating throughout the day,,can process 1,680 samples.,Can you imagine the potential offspring applications --,environmental detection,of pollutants in soils,,customs applications,,detection of illicit goods in containers and so on. 
 But let's stick first to tuberculosis.,I just want to briefly highlight,,the blue rods,are the scores of microscopy only,at the five clinics in Dar es Salaam,on a population of 500,000 people,,where 15,000 reported to get a test done.,Microscopy for 1,800 patients.,And by just presenting the samples once more to the rats,and looping those results back,,we were able to increase case detection rates,by over 30 percent.,Throughout last year,,we've been -- depending on which intervals you take --,we've been consistently,increasing case detection rates,in five hospitals in Dar es Salaam,between 30 and 40 percent.,So this is really considerable.,Knowing that a missed patient by microscopy,infects up to 15 people,,healthy people, per year,,you can be sure,that we have saved lots of lives.,At least our hero rats have saved lots of lives. 
 The way forward for us,is now to standardize this technology.,And there are simple things,like, for instance, we have a small laser in the sniffer hole,where the animal has to stick for five seconds.,So, to standardize this.,Also, to standardize the pellets,,the food rewards,,and to semi-automate this,in order to replicate this on a much larger scale,and affect the lives of many more people.,To conclude, there are also other applications at the horizon.,Here is a first prototype,of our camera rat,,which is a rat with a rat backpack,with a camera that can go under rubble,to detect for victims,after earthquake and so on.,This is in a prototype stage.,We don't have a working system here yet. 
 To conclude, I would actually like to say,,you may think this is about rats, these projects,,but in the end it is about people.,It is about empowering vulnerable communities,to tackle difficult, expensive,and dangerous humanitarian detection tasks,,and doing that with a local resource,,plenty available.,So something completely different,is to keep on challenging your perception,about the resources surrounding you,,whether they are environmental,,technological, animal, or human.,And to respectfully harmonize with them,in order to foster a sustainable world. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)So, I'll start with this: a couplenyears ago, an event planner called me,because I was goingnto do a speaking event.,And she called, and she said,,"I'm really struggling with hownto write about you on the little flyer.",And I thought,n"Well, what's the struggle?",And she said, "Well, I saw you speak,,and I'm going to call youna researcher, I think,,but I'm afraid if I call youna researcher, no one will come,,because they'll thinknyou're boring and irrelevant." 
 (Laughter) 
 And I was like, "Okay.",And she said, "But the thingnI liked about your talk,is you're a storyteller.,So I think what I'll donis just call you a storyteller.",And of course, the academic,ninsecure part of me,was like, "You're goingnto call me a what?",And she said, "I'm goingnto call you a storyteller.",And I was like, "Why not 'magic pixie'?" 
 (Laughter) 
 I was like, "Let me thinknabout this for a second.",I tried to call deep on my courage.,And I thought, you know,nI am a storyteller.,I'm a qualitative researcher.,I collect stories; that's what I do.,And maybe storiesnare just data with a soul.,And maybe I'm just a storyteller.,And so I said, "You know what?,Why don't you just saynI'm a researcher-storyteller.",And she went, "Ha ha.nThere's no such thing." 
 (Laughter) 
 So I'm a researcher-storyteller,nand I'm going to talk to you today --,we're talking aboutnexpanding perception --,and so I want to talk to younand tell some stories,about a piece of my researchnthat fundamentally expanded my perception,and really actually changednthe way that I live and love,and work and parent. 
 And this is where my story starts.,When I was a young researcher,ndoctoral student,,my first year, I hadna research professor who said to us,,"Here's the thing, if you cannotnmeasure it, it does not exist.",And I thought he was justnsweet-talking me.,I was like, "Really?"nand he was like, "Absolutely.",And so you have to understand,that I have a bachelor'snand a master's in social work,,and I was getting my Ph.D. in social work,nso my entire academic career,was surrounded by people who kind ofnbelieved in the "life's messy, love it.",And I'm more of the, "life's messy,nclean it up, organize it,and put it into a bento box." 
 (Laughter) 
 And so to think that I had found my way,nto found a career that takes me --,really, one of the big sayingsnin social work is,,"Lean into the discomfort of the work.",And I'm like, knock discomfortnupside the head,and move it over and get all A's.,That was my mantra.,So I was very excited about this.,And so I thought, you know what,nthis is the career for me,,because I am interestednin some messy topics.,But I want to be ablento make them not messy.,I want to understand them.,I want to hack into these thingsnthat I know are important,and lay the code out for everyone to see. 
 So where I started was with connection.,Because, by the timenyou're a social worker for 10 years,,what you realize is that connectionnis why we're here.,It's what gives purposenand meaning to our lives.,This is what it's all about.,It doesn't matter whethernyou talk to people,who work in social justice,nmental health and abuse and neglect,,what we know is that connection,nthe ability to feel connected, is --,neurobiologicallynthat's how we're wired --,it's why we're here. 
 So I thought, you know what,nI'm going to start with connection.,Well, you know that situation,where you get an evaluationnfrom your boss,,and she tells you 37 thingsnthat you do really awesome,,and one "opportunity for growth?" 
 (Laughter) 
 And all you can think aboutnis that opportunity for growth, right?,Well, apparently this is the waynmy work went as well,,because, when you ask people about love,nthey tell you about heartbreak.,When you ask people about belonging,,they'll tell you their most excruciatingnexperiences of being excluded.,And when you ask people about connection,,the stories they told menwere about disconnection. 
 So very quickly -- really about six weeksninto this research --,I ran into this unnamed thingnthat absolutely unraveled connection,in a way that I didn't understandnor had never seen.,And so I pulled back out of the research,and thought, I neednto figure out what this is.,And it turned out to be shame.,And shame is really easily understoodnas the fear of disconnection:,Is there something about me that,nif other people know it or see it,,that I won't be worthy of connection? 
 The things I can tell you about it:,It's universal; we all have it.,The only people who don't experience shame,have no capacity for humannempathy or connection.,No one wants to talk about it,,and the less you talk about it,nthe more you have it.,What underpinned this shame,nthis "I'm not good enough," --,which, we all know that feeling:,"I'm not blank enough.nI'm not thin enough,,rich enough, beautiful enough,nsmart enough, promoted enough.",The thing that underpinned thisnwas excruciating vulnerability.,This idea of, in ordernfor connection to happen,,we have to allow ourselvesnto be seen, really seen. 
 And you know how I feelnabout vulnerability. I hate vulnerability.,And so I thought, this is my chancento beat it back with my measuring stick.,I'm going in, I'm goingnto figure this stuff out,,I'm going to spend a year,nI'm going to totally deconstruct shame,,I'm going to understandnhow vulnerability works,,and I'm going to outsmart it.,So I was ready, and I was really excited.,As you know,nit's not going to turn out well. 
 (Laughter) 
 You know this.,So, I could tell you a lot about shame,,but I'd have to borrowneveryone else's time.,But here's what I can tell younthat it boils down to --,and this may be one of the most importantnthings that I've ever learned,in the decade of doing this research. 
 My one year turned into six years:,Thousands of stories, hundredsnof long interviews, focus groups.,At one point, people werensending me journal pages,and sending me their stories --,thousands of pieces of data in six years.,And I kind of got a handle on it.,I kind of understood, this isnwhat shame is, this is how it works.,I wrote a book, I published a theory,nbut something was not okay --,and what it was is that, if I roughlyntook the people I interviewed,and divided them into people who reallynhave a sense of worthiness --,that's what this comes down to,na sense of worthiness --,they have a strong sensenof love and belonging --,and folks who struggle for it,,and folks who are always wonderingnif they're good enough. 
 There was only one variable that separated,the people who have a strong sensenof love and belonging,and the people who really struggle for it.,And that was, the people who havena strong sense of love and belonging,believe they're worthynof love and belonging.,That's it.,They believe they're worthy.,And to me, the hard part of the one thingnthat keeps us out of connection,is our fear that we're notnworthy of connection,,was something that,npersonally and professionally,,I felt like I needed to understand better.,So what I did is I tooknall of the interviews,where I saw worthiness,nwhere I saw people living that way,,and just looked at those. 
 What do these people have in common?,I have a slight office supply addiction,nbut that's another talk.,So I had a manila folder,nand I had a Sharpie,,and I was like, what am I goingnto call this research?,And the first words that camento my mind were "whole-hearted.",These are whole-hearted people,nliving from this deep sense of worthiness.,So I wrote at the topnof the manila folder,,and I started looking at the data.,In fact, I did it first in a four-day,nvery intensive data analysis,,where I went back, pulled the interviews,nthe stories, pulled the incidents.,What's the theme? What's the pattern?,My husband left town with the kids,because I always go into thisnJackson Pollock crazy thing,,where I'm just writingnand in my researcher mode. 
 And so here's what I found.,What they had in commonnwas a sense of courage.,And I want to separate couragenand bravery for you for a minute.,Courage, the originalndefinition of courage,,when it first cameninto the English language --,it's from the Latin word "cor,"nmeaning "heart" --,and the original definition was to tellnthe story of who you are,with your whole heart.,And so these folks had, very simply,nthe courage to be imperfect.,They had the compassion to be kindnto themselves first and then to others,,because, as it turns out,,we can't practice compassionnwith other people,if we can't treat ourselves kindly.,And the last was they had connection,nand -- this was the hard part --,as a result of authenticity,,they were willing to let gonof who they thought they should be,in order to be who they were,nwhich you have to absolutely do that,for connection. 
 The other thing that they hadnin common was this:,They fully embraced vulnerability.,They believed that what made themnvulnerable made them beautiful.,They didn't talk about vulnerabilitynbeing comfortable,,nor did they really talknabout it being excruciating --,as I had heard it earliernin the shame interviewing.,They just talked about it being necessary.,They talked about the willingnessnto say, "I love you" first ...,the willingness to do somethingnwhere there are no guarantees ...,the willingness to breathenthrough waiting for the doctor to call,after your mammogram.,They're willing to investnin a relationship,that may or may not work out.,They thought this was fundamental. 
 I personally thought it was betrayal.,I could not believe I had pledgednallegiance to research, where our job --,you know, the definition of researchnis to control and predict,,to study phenomena for the explicitnreason to control and predict.,And now my mission to control and predict,had turned up the answernthat the way to live is with vulnerability,and to stop controlling and predicting.,This led to a little breakdown -- 
 (Laughter) 
 -- which actually looked more like this. 
 (Laughter) 
 And it did. 
 I call it a breakdown; my therapistncalls it a spiritual awakening. 
 (Laughter) 
 A spiritual awakeningnsounds better than breakdown,,but I assure you, it was a breakdown.,And I had to put my data awaynand go find a therapist.,Let me tell you something:nyou know who you are,when you call your friends and say,n"I think I need to see somebody.,Do you have any recommendations?",Because about fivenof my friends were like,,"Wooo, I wouldn't wantnto be your therapist." 
 (Laughter) 
 I was like, "What does that mean?",And they're like,n"I'm just saying, you know.,Don't bring your measuring stick." 
 (Laughter) 
 I was like, "Okay.",So I found a therapist.,My first meeting with her, Diana --,I brought in my list of the waynthe whole-hearted live, and I sat down.,And she said, "How are you?",And I said, "I'm great. I'm okay.",She said, "What's going on?",And this is a therapistnwho sees therapists,,because we have to go to those,nbecause their B.S. meters are good. 
 (Laughter) 
 And so I said, "Here's the thing,nI'm struggling.",And she said, "What's the struggle?",And I said, "Well, I havena vulnerability issue.,And I know that vulnerabilitynis the core of shame and fear,and our struggle for worthiness,,but it appears that it's alsonthe birthplace of joy, of creativity,,of belonging, of love.,And I think I have a problem,nand I need some help.",And I said, "But here's the thing:nno family stuff, no childhood shit." 
 (Laughter) 
 "I just need some strategies." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you.,So she goes like this. 
 (Laughter) 
 And then I said, "It's bad, right?",And she said, "It's neither good nor bad." 
 (Laughter) 
 "It just is what it is.",And I said, "Oh my God,nthis is going to suck." 
 (Laughter) 
 And it did, and it didn't.,And it took about a year.,And you know how there are people,that, when they realize that vulnerabilitynand tenderness are important,,that they surrender and walk into it.,A: that's not me,,and B: I don't even hang outnwith people like that. 
 (Laughter) 
 For me, it was a yearlong street fight.,It was a slugfest.,Vulnerability pushed, I pushed back.,I lost the fight,,but probably won my life back. 
 And so then I went back into the research,and spent the next couple of years,really trying to understandnwhat they, the whole-hearted,,what choices they were making,nand what we are doing with vulnerability.,Why do we struggle with it so much?,Am I alone in strugglingnwith vulnerability?,No. 
 So this is what I learned.,We numb vulnerability --,when we're waiting for the call.,It was funny, I sent something outnon Twitter and on Facebook,that says, "How would youndefine vulnerability?,What makes you feel vulnerable?",And within an hour and a half,nI had 150 responses.,Because I wanted to know what's out there.,Having to ask my husband for helpnbecause I'm sick, and we're newly married;,initiating sex with my husband;,initiating sex with my wife;,being turned down; asking someone out;,waiting for the doctor to call back;,getting laid off; laying off people.,This is the world we live in.,We live in a vulnerable world.,And one of the ways we dealnwith it is we numb vulnerability. 
 And I think there's evidence --,and it's not the only reasonnthis evidence exists,,but I think it's a huge cause --,We are the most in-debt ...,obese ...,addicted and medicatednadult cohort in U.S. history.,The problem is -- and I learned thisnfrom the research --,that you cannot selectively numb emotion.,You can't say, here's the bad stuff.,Here's vulnerability,nhere's grief, here's shame,,here's fear, here's disappointment.,I don't want to feel these.,I'm going to have a couple of beersnand a banana nut muffin. 
 (Laughter) 
 I don't want to feel these.,And I know that's knowing laughter.,I hack into your lives for a living.,God. 
 (Laughter) 
 You can't numb those hard feelings,without numbingnthe other affects, our emotions.,You cannot selectively numb.,So when we numb those,,we numb joy,,we numb gratitude,,we numb happiness.,And then, we are miserable,,and we are lookingnfor purpose and meaning,,and then we feel vulnerable,,so then we have a couple of beersnand a banana nut muffin.,And it becomes this dangerous cycle. 
 One of the things that I thinknwe need to think about,is why and how we numb.,And it doesn't just have to be addiction.,The other thing we do is we makeneverything that's uncertain certain.,Religion has gone from a beliefnin faith and mystery to certainty.,"I'm right, you're wrong. Shut up.",That's it.,Just certain.,The more afraid we are,nthe more vulnerable we are,,the more afraid we are.,This is what politics looks like today.,There's no discourse anymore.,There's no conversation.,There's just blame.,You know how blamenis described in the research?,A way to discharge pain and discomfort.,We perfect.,If there's anyone who wants their lifento look like this, it would be me,,but it doesn't work.,Because what we do is we take fatnfrom our butts and put it in our cheeks. 
 (Laughter) 
 Which just, I hope in 100 years,npeople will look back and go, "Wow." 
 (Laughter) 
 And we perfect,nmost dangerously, our children.,Let me tell you what we thinknabout children.,They're hardwired for strugglenwhen they get here.,And when you hold those perfectnlittle babies in your hand,,our job is not to say,n"Look at her, she's perfect.,My job is just to keep her perfect --,make sure she makes the tennis teamnby fifth grade and Yale by seventh.",That's not our job.,Our job is to look and say,,"You know what? You're imperfect,nand you're wired for struggle,,but you are worthy of love and belonging.",That's our job.,Show me a generationnof kids raised like that,,and we'll end the problems,nI think, that we see today.,We pretend that what we dondoesn't have an effect on people.,We do that in our personal lives.,We do that corporate --,whether it's a bailout, an oil spill ...,a recall.,We pretend like what we're doing,doesn't have a huge impactnon other people.,I would say to companies,nthis is not our first rodeo, people.,We just need you to be authenticnand real and say ...,"We're sorry. We'll fix it." 
 But there's another way,nand I'll leave you with this.,This is what I have found:,To let ourselves be seen,ndeeply seen, vulnerably seen ...,to love with our whole hearts,neven though there's no guarantee --,and that's really hard,,and I can tell you as a parent,nthat's excruciatingly difficult --,to practice gratitude and joynin those moments of terror,,when we're wondering,n"Can I love you this much?,Can I believe in this this passionately?,Can I be this fierce about this?",just to be able to stop and, instead ofncatastrophizing what might happen,,to say, "I'm just so grateful,,because to feel this vulnerablenmeans I'm alive.",And the last, which I thinknis probably the most important,,is to believe that we're enough.,Because when we work from a place,nI believe, that says, "I'm enough" ...,then we stop screamingnand start listening,,we're kinder and gentlernto the people around us,,and we're kinder and gentler to ourselves. 
 That's all I have. Thank you. 
 (Applause)I spent the best part of last year,working on a documentary,about my own happiness --,trying to see,if I can actually train my mind,in a particular way,,like I can train my body,,so I can end up with an improved feeling,of overall well-being.,Then this January,,my mother died,,and pursuing a film like that,just seemed the last thing that was interesting to me.,So in a very typical, silly designer fashion,,after years worth of work,,pretty much all I have to show for it are the titles for the film. 
 (Music) 
 They were still done,when I was on sabbatical with my company in Indonesia.,We can see the first part here was designed here by pigs.,It was a little bit too funky,,and we wanted a more feminine point of view,and employed a duck,who did it in a much more fitting way --,fashion.,My studio in Bali,was only 10 minutes away from a monkey forest,,and monkeys, of course,,are supposed to be the happiest of all animals.,So we trained them to be able to do three separate words,,to lay out them properly.,You can see,,there still is a little bit of a legibility problem there.,The serif is not really in place.,So of course, what you don't do properly yourself,is never deemed done really.,So this is us climbing onto the trees,and putting it up over the Sayan Valley,in Indonesia. 
 In that year, what I did do a lot,was look at all sorts of surveys,,looking at a lot of data on this subject.,And it turns out,that men and women,report very, very similar levels of happiness.,This is a very quick overview,of all the studies that I looked at.,That climate plays no role.,That if you live in the best climate,,in San Diego in the United States,,or in the shittiest climate, in Buffalo, New York,,you are going to be just as happy,in either place.,If you make more than 50,000 bucks a year in the U.S.,,any salary increase you're going to experience,will have only a tiny, tiny influence,on your overall well-being.,Black people are just as happy as white people are.,If you're old or young,it doesn't really make a difference.,If you're ugly or if you're really, really good-looking,it makes no difference whatsoever.,You will adapt to it and get used to it.,If you have manageable health problems,it doesn't really matter. 
 Now this does matter.,So now the woman on the right,is actually much happier than the guy on the left --,meaning that, if you have a lot of friends,,and you have meaningful friendships,,that does make a lot of difference.,As well as being married -- you are likely to be much happier,than if you are single. 
 A fellow TED speaker, Jonathan Haidt,,came up with this beautiful little analogy,between the conscious and the unconscious mind.,He says that the conscious mind is this tiny rider,on this giant elephant, the unconscious.,And the rider thinks,that he can tell the elephant what to do,,but the elephant really has his own ideas.,If I look at my own life,,I'm born in 1962 in Austria.,If I would have been born a hundred years earlier,,the big decisions in my life would have been made for me --,meaning I would have stayed in the town that I was born in;,I would have very much likely,entered the same profession that my dad did;,and I would have very much likely married a woman,that my mom had selected.,I, of course, and all of us,,are very much in charge,of these big decisions in our lives.,We live where we want to be --,at least in the West.,We become what we really are interested in.,We choose our own profession,,and we choose our own partners.,And so it's quite surprising,that many of us,let our unconscious influence those decisions,in ways that we are not quite aware of. 
 If you look at the statistics,and you see that the guy called George,,when he decides on where he wants to live --,is it Florida or North Dakota? --,he goes and lives in Georgia.,And if you look at a guy called Dennis,,when he decides what to become --,is it a lawyer, or does he want to become a doctor,or a teacher? --,best chance is that he wants to become a dentist.,And if Paula decides,should she marry Joe or Jack,,somehow Paul sounds the most interesting.,And so even if we make,those very important decisions,for very silly reasons,,it remains statistically true,that there are more Georges living in Georgia,and there are more Dennises becoming dentists,and there are more Paulas who are married to Paul,than statistically viable.,(Laughter),Now I, of course, thought,,"Well this is American data,",and I thought, "Well, those silly Americans.,They get influenced by things,that they're not aware of.,This is just completely ridiculous.",Then, of course, I looked at my mom and my dad --,(Laughter),Karolina and Karl,,and grandmom and granddad,,Josefine and Josef.,So I am looking still for a Stephanie.,I'll figure something out. 
 If I make this whole thing a little bit more personal,and see what makes me happy as a designer,,the easiest answer, of course,,is do more of the stuff that I like to do,and much less of the stuff that I don't like to do --,for which it would be helpful,to know what it is that I actually do like to do.,I'm a big list maker,,so I came up with a list.,One of them is to think without pressure.,This is a project we're working on right now,with a very healthy deadline.,It's a book on culture,,and, as you can see,,culture is rapidly drifting around.,Doing things like I'm doing right now --,traveling to Cannes.,The example I have here,is a chair that came out of the year in Bali --,clearly influenced by local manufacturing and culture,,not being stuck behind,a single computer screen all day long,and be here and there.,Quite consciously, design projects,that need an incredible amount of various techniques,,just basically to fight,straightforward adaptation. 
 Being close to the content --,that's the content really is close to my heart.,This is a bus, or vehicle,,for a charity, for an NGO,that wants to double the education budget in the United States --,carefully designed,,so, by two inches, it still clears highway overpasses.,Having end results -- things that come back from the printer well,,like this little business card for an animation company,called Sideshow,on lenticular foils.,Working on projects,that actually have visible impacts,,like a book for a deceased German artist,whose widow came to us,with the requirement to make her late husband famous.,It just came out six months ago,,and it's getting unbelievable traction right now in Germany.,And I think that his widow,is going to be very successful on her quest. 
 And lately, to be involved in projects,where I know about 50 percent of the project,technique-wise,and the other 50 percent would be new.,So in this case,,it's an outside projection for Singapore,on these giant Times Square-like screens.,And I of course knew stuff, as a designer,,about typography,,even though we worked with those animals not so successfully.,But I didn't quite know,all that much about movement or film.,And from that point of view we turned it into a lovely project.,But also because the content was very close.,In this case, "Keeping a Diary,Supports Personal Development" --,I've been keeping a diary since I was 12.,And I've found that it influenced my life and work,in a very intriguing way.,In this case also because,it's part of one of the many sentiments,that we build the whole series on --,that all the sentiments originally had come out of the diary. 
 Thank you so much. 
 (Applause)I got up this morning at 6:10 a.m.,after going to sleep at 12:45 a.m.,I was awakened once during the night.,My heart rate was 61 beats per minute --,my blood pressure, 127 over 74.,I had zero minutes of exercise yesterday,,so my maximum heart rate during exercise wasn't calculated.,I had about 600 milligrams of caffeine,,zero of alcohol.,And my score on the Narcissism Personality Index,,or the NPI-16,,is a reassuring 0.31. 
 We know that numbers are useful for us,when we advertise, manage, govern, search.,I'm going to talk about how they're useful when we reflect,,learn, remember,and want to improve.,A few years ago, Kevin Kelly, my partner, and I,noticed that people were subjecting themselves,to regimes of quantitative measurement and self-tracking,that went far beyond the ordinary, familiar habits,such as stepping on a scale every day.,People were tracking their food via Twitter,,their kids' diapers on their iPhone.,They were making detailed journals,of their spending, their mood,,their symptoms, their treatments. 
 Now, we know some of the technological facts,that are driving this change in our lifestyle --,the uptake and diffusion of mobile devices,,the exponential improvement in data storage,and data processing,,and the remarkable improvement in human biometric sensors.,This little black dot there,is a 3D accelerometer.,It tracks your movement through space.,It is, as you can see, very small and also very cheap.,They're now down to well under a dollar a piece,,and they're going into all kinds of devices.,But what's interesting,is the incredible detailed information that you can get,from just one sensor like this.,This kind of sensor,is in the hit biometric device --,among early adopters at the moment -- the Fitbit.,This tracks your activity and also your sleep.,It has just that sensor in it. 
 You're probably familiar with the Nike+ system.,I just put it up because that little blue dot is the sensor.,It's really just a pressure sensor,like the kind that's in a doorbell.,And Nike knows how to get,your pace and distance from just that sensor.,This is the strap,that people use to transmit heart-rate data,to their Nike+ system. 
 This is a beautiful, new device,that gives you detailed sleep tracking data,,not just whether you're asleep or awake, but also your phase of sleep --,deep sleep, light sleep, REM sleep.,The sensor is just a little strip of metal in that headband there.,The rest of it is the bedside console;,just for reference, this is a sleep tracking system from just a few years ago --,I mean, really until now.,And this is the sleep tracking system of today. 
 This just was presented,at a health care conference in D.C.,Most of what you see there is an asthma inhaler,,but the top is a very small GPS transceiver,,which gives you the date and location,of an asthma incident,,giving you a new awareness,of your vulnerability,in relation to time and environmental factors. 
 Now, we know that new tools,are changing our sense of self in the world --,these tiny sensors that gather data in nature,,the ubiquitous computing,that allows that data to be understood and used,,and of course the social networks,that allow people to collaborate and contribute.,But we think of these tools as pointing outward,,as windows,and I'd just like to invite you to think of them,as also turning inward,and becoming mirrors.,So that when we think about using them,to get some systematic improvement,,we also think about how they can be useful for self-improvement,,for self-discovery, self-awareness, self-knowledge. 
 Here's a biometric device:,a pair of Apple Earbuds.,Last year, Apple filed some patents,to get blood oxygenation,,heart rate and body temperature via the Earbuds.,What is this for?,What should it be for?,Some people will say it's for biometric security.,Some people will say it's for public health research.,Some people will say it's for avant-garde marketing research.,I'd like to tell you,that it's also for self-knowledge.,And the self isn't the only thing; it's not even most things.,The self is just our operation center,,our consciousness,,our moral compass.,So, if we want to act,more effectively in the world,,we have to get to know ourselves better. 
 Thank you.I still remember the day in school,when our teacher told us,that the world population had become,three billion people,,and that was in 1960.,I'm going to talk now about,how world population has changed from that year,and into the future,,but I will not use digital technology,,as I've done during my first five TEDTalks.,Instead, I have progressed,,and I am, today, launching,a brand new analog teaching technology,that I picked up from IKEA:,this box. 
 This box contains one billion people.,And our teacher told us,that the industrialized world, 1960,,had one billion people.,In the developing world, she said,,they had two billion people.,And they lived away then.,There was a big gap between,the one billion in the industrialized world,and the two billion in the developing world.,In the industrialized world,,people were healthy,,educated, rich,,and they had small families.,And their aspiration,was to buy a car.,And in 1960, all Swedes were saving,to try to buy a Volvo like this.,This was the economic level at which Sweden was.,But in contrast to this,,in the developing world, far away,,the aspiration of the average family there,was to have food for the day.,They were saving,to be able to buy a pair of shoes.,There was an enormous gap in the world,when I grew up.,And this gap between the West and the rest,has created a mindset of the world,,which we still use linguistically,when we talk about "the West",and "the Developing World.",But the world has changed,,and it's overdue to upgrade that mindset,and that taxonomy of the world, and to understand it. 
 And that's what I'm going to show you,,because since 1960,what has happened in the world up to 2010,is that a staggering,four billion people,have been added to the world population.,Just look how many.,The world population has doubled,since I went to school.,And of course, there's been economic growth in the West.,A lot of companies have happened to grow the economy,,so the Western population moved over to here.,And now their aspiration is not only to have a car.,Now they want to have a holiday on a very remote destination,and they want to fly.,So this is where they are today.,And the most successful of the developing countries,,they have moved on, you know,,and they have become emerging economies, we call them.,They are now buying cars.,And what happened a month ago,was that the Chinese company, Geely,,they acquired the Volvo company,,and then finally the Swedes understood that,something big had happened in the world.,(Laughter) 
 So there they are.,And the tragedy is that the two billion over here,that is struggling for food and shoes,,they are still almost as poor,as they were 50 years ago.,The new thing is that,we have the biggest pile of billions, the three billions here,,which are also becoming emerging economies,,because they are quite healthy, relatively well-educated,,and they already also have two to three children,per woman, as those [richer also] have.,And their aspiration now,is, of course, to buy a bicycle,,and then later on they would like to have a motorbike also.,But this is the world,we have today,,no longer any gap.,But the distance from the poorest here, the very poorest,,to the very richest over here is wider than ever.,But there is a continuous world,from walking, biking,,driving, flying --,there are people on all levels,,and most people tend to be somewhere in the middle.,This is the new world we have today,in 2010. 
 And what will happen in the future?,Well, I'm going to project,into 2050.,I was in Shanghai recently,,and I listened to what's happening in China,,and it's pretty sure that they will catch up,,just as Japan did.,All the projections [say that] this one [billion] will [only] grow with,one to two or three percent.,[But this second] grows with seven, eight percent, and then they will end up here.,They will start flying.,And these,lower or middle income countries, the emerging income countries,,they will also forge forwards economically.,And if,,but only if,,we invest in the right green technology --,so that we can avoid severe climate change,,and energy can still be relatively cheap --,then they will move all the way up here.,And they will start to buy,electric cars.,This is what we will find there. 
 So what about the poorest two billion?,What about the poorest two billion here?,Will they move on?,Well, here population [growth] comes in,because there [among emerging economies] we already have two to three children per woman,,family planning is widely used,,and population growth is coming to an end.,Here [among the poorest], population is growing.,So these [poorest] two billion will, in the next decades,,increase to three billion,,and they will thereafter,increase to four billion.,There is nothing --,but a nuclear war of a kind we've never seen --,that can stop this [growth] from happening.,Because we already have this [growth] in process.,But if, and only if,,[the poorest] get out of poverty,,they get education, they get improved child survival,,they can buy a bicycle and a cell phone and come [to live] here,,then population growth,will stop in 2050.,We cannot have people on this level,looking for food and shoes,because then we get continued population growth. 
 And let me show you why,by converting back to the old-time,digital technology.,Here I have on the screen,my country bubbles.,Every bubble is a country. The size is population.,The colors show the continent.,The yellow on there is the Americas;,dark blue is Africa; brown is Europe;,green is the Middle East,and this light blue is South Asia.,That's India and this is China. Size is population.,Here I have children per woman:,two children, four children, six children, eight children --,big families, small families.,The year is 1960.,And down here, child survival,,the percentage of children surviving childhood,up to starting school:,60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent, 90,,and almost 100 percent, as we have today,in the wealthiest and healthiest countries.,But look, this is the world my teacher talked about in 1960:,one billion Western world here --,high child-survival, small families --,and all the rest,,the rainbow of developing countries,,with very large families,and poor child survival. 
 What has happened? I start the world. Here we go.,Can you see, as the years pass by, child survival is increasing?,They get soap, hygiene, education,,vaccination, penicillin,and then family planning. Family size is decreasing.,[When] they get up to 90-percent child survival, then families decrease,,and most of the Arab countries in the Middle East,is falling down there [to small families].,Look, Bangladesh catching up with India.,The whole emerging world,joins the Western world,with good child survival,and small family size,,but we still have the poorest billion.,Can you see the poorest billion,,those [two] boxes I had over here?,They are still up here.,And they still have a child survival,of only 70 to 80 percent,,meaning that if you have six children born,,there will be at least four who survive,to the next generation.,And the population will double in one generation. 
 So the only way,of really getting world population [growth] to stop,is to continue to improve child survival,to 90 percent.,That's why investments by Gates Foundation,,UNICEF and aid organizations,,together with national government in the poorest countries,,are so good;,because they are actually,helping us to reach,a sustainable population size of the world.,We can stop at nine billion if we do the right things.,Child survival is the new green.,It's only by child survival,that we will stop population growth.,And will it happen?,Well, I'm not an optimist,,neither am I a pessimist.,I'm a very serious "possibilist.",It's a new category where we take emotion apart,,and we just work analytically with the world.,It can be done.,We can have a much more just world.,With green technology,and with investments to alleviate poverty,,and global governance,,the world can become like this. 
 And look at the position of the old West.,Remember when this blue box was all alone,,leading the world, living its own life.,This will not happen [again].,The role of the old West in the new world,is to become the foundation,of the modern world --,nothing more, nothing less.,But it's a very important role.,Do it well and get used to it. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)For the last 10 years, I've been spending my time trying to figure out,how and why human beings,assemble themselves into social networks.,And the kind of social network I'm talking about,is not the recent online variety,,but rather, the kind of social networks,that human beings have been assembling for hundreds of thousands of years,,ever since we emerged from the African savannah.,So, I form friendships and co-worker,and sibling and relative relationships with other people,who in turn have similar relationships with other people.,And this spreads on out endlessly into a distance.,And you get a network that looks like this.,Every dot is a person.,Every line between them is a relationship between two people --,different kinds of relationships.,And you can get this kind of vast fabric of humanity,,in which we're all embedded. 
 And my colleague, James Fowler and I have been studying for quite sometime,what are the mathematical, social,,biological and psychological rules,that govern how these networks are assembled,and what are the similar rules,that govern how they operate, how they affect our lives.,But recently, we've been wondering,whether it might be possible to take advantage of this insight,,to actually find ways to improve the world,,to do something better,,to actually fix things, not just understand things.,So one of the first things we thought we would tackle,would be how we go about predicting epidemics. 
 And the current state of the art in predicting an epidemic --,if you're the CDC or some other national body --,is to sit in the middle where you are,and collect data,from physicians and laboratories in the field,that report the prevalence or the incidence of certain conditions.,So, so and so patients have been diagnosed with something,,or other patients have been diagnosed,,and all these data are fed into a central repository, with some delay.,And if everything goes smoothly,,one to two weeks from now,you'll know where the epidemic was today.,And actually, about a year or so ago,,there was this promulgation,of the idea of Google Flu Trends, with respect to the flu,,where by looking at people's searching behavior today,,we could know where the flu --,what the status of the epidemic was today,,what's the prevalence of the epidemic today. 
 But what I'd like to show you today,is a means by which we might get,not just rapid warning about an epidemic,,but also actually,early detection of an epidemic.,And, in fact, this idea can be used,not just to predict epidemics of germs,,but also to predict epidemics of all sorts of kinds.,For example, anything that spreads by a form of social contagion,could be understood in this way,,from abstract ideas on the left,like patriotism, or altruism, or religion,to practices,like dieting behavior, or book purchasing,,or drinking, or bicycle-helmet [and] other safety practices,,or products that people might buy,,purchases of electronic goods,,anything in which there's kind of an interpersonal spread.,A kind of a diffusion of innovation,could be understood and predicted,by the mechanism I'm going to show you now. 
 So, as all of you probably know,,the classic way of thinking about this,is the diffusion-of-innovation,,or the adoption curve.,So here on the Y-axis, we have the percent of the people affected,,and on the X-axis, we have time.,And at the very beginning, not too many people are affected,,and you get this classic sigmoidal,,or S-shaped, curve.,And the reason for this shape is that at the very beginning,,let's say one or two people,are infected, or affected by the thing,and then they affect, or infect, two people,,who in turn affect four, eight, 16 and so forth,,and you get the epidemic growth phase of the curve.,And eventually, you saturate the population.,There are fewer and fewer people,who are still available that you might infect,,and then you get the plateau of the curve,,and you get this classic sigmoidal curve.,And this holds for germs, ideas,,product adoption, behaviors,,and the like.,But things don't just diffuse in human populations at random.,They actually diffuse through networks.,Because, as I said, we live our lives in networks,,and these networks have a particular kind of a structure. 
 Now if you look at a network like this --,this is 105 people.,And the lines represent -- the dots are the people,,and the lines represent friendship relationships.,You might see that people occupy,different locations within the network.,And there are different kinds of relationships between the people.,You could have friendship relationships, sibling relationships,,spousal relationships, co-worker relationships,,neighbor relationships and the like.,And different sorts of things,spread across different sorts of ties.,For instance, sexually transmitted diseases,will spread across sexual ties.,Or, for instance, people's smoking behavior,might be influenced by their friends.,Or their altruistic or their charitable giving behavior,might be influenced by their coworkers,,or by their neighbors.,But not all positions in the network are the same. 
 So if you look at this, you might immediately grasp,that different people have different numbers of connections.,Some people have one connection, some have two,,some have six, some have 10 connections.,And this is called the "degree" of a node,,or the number of connections that a node has.,But in addition, there's something else.,So, if you look at nodes A and B,,they both have six connections.,But if you can see this image [of the network] from a bird's eye view,,you can appreciate that there's something very different,about nodes A and B.,So, let me ask you this -- I can cultivate this intuition by asking a question --,who would you rather be,if a deadly germ was spreading through the network, A or B?,(Audience: B.) Nicholas Christakis: B, it's obvious.,B is located on the edge of the network.,Now, who would you rather be,if a juicy piece of gossip were spreading through the network?,A. And you have an immediate appreciation,that A is going to be more likely,to get the thing that's spreading and to get it sooner,by virtue of their structural location within the network.,A, in fact, is more central,,and this can be formalized mathematically.,So, if we want to track something,that was spreading through a network,,what we ideally would like to do is to set up sensors,on the central individuals within the network,,including node A,,monitor those people that are right there in the middle of the network,,and somehow get an early detection,of whatever it is that is spreading through the network. 
 So if you saw them contract a germ or a piece of information,,you would know that, soon enough,,everybody was about to contract this germ,or this piece of information.,And this would be much better,than monitoring six randomly chosen people,,without reference to the structure of the population.,And in fact, if you could do that,,what you would see is something like this.,On the left-hand panel, again, we have the S-shaped curve of adoption.,In the dotted red line, we show,what the adoption would be in the random people,,and in the left-hand line, shifted to the left,,we show what the adoption would be,in the central individuals within the network.,On the Y-axis is the cumulative instances of contagion,,and on the X-axis is the time.,And on the right-hand side, we show the same data,,but here with daily incidence.,And what we show here is -- like, here --,very few people are affected, more and more and more and up to here,,and here's the peak of the epidemic.,But shifted to the left is what's occurring in the central individuals.,And this difference in time between the two,is the early detection, the early warning we can get,,about an impending epidemic,in the human population. 
 The problem, however,,is that mapping human social networks,is not always possible.,It can be expensive, not feasible,,unethical,,or, frankly, just not possible to do such a thing.,So, how can we figure out,who the central people are in a network,without actually mapping the network?,What we came up with,was an idea to exploit an old fact,,or a known fact, about social networks,,which goes like this:,Do you know that your friends,have more friends than you do?,Your friends have more friends than you do,,and this is known as the friendship paradox.,Imagine a very popular person in the social network --,like a party host who has hundreds of friends --,and a misanthrope who has just one friend,,and you pick someone at random from the population;,they were much more likely to know the party host.,And if they nominate the party host as their friend,,that party host has a hundred friends,,therefore, has more friends than they do.,And this, in essence, is what's known as the friendship paradox.,The friends of randomly chosen people,have higher degree, and are more central,than the random people themselves. 
 And you can get an intuitive appreciation for this,if you imagine just the people at the perimeter of the network.,If you pick this person,,the only friend they have to nominate is this person,,who, by construction, must have at least two,and typically more friends.,And that happens at every peripheral node.,And in fact, it happens throughout the network as you move in,,everyone you pick, when they nominate a random --,when a random person nominates a friend of theirs,,you move closer to the center of the network.,So, we thought we would exploit this idea,in order to study whether we could predict phenomena within networks.,Because now, with this idea,we can take a random sample of people,,have them nominate their friends,,those friends would be more central,,and we could do this without having to map the network. 
 And we tested this idea with an outbreak of H1N1 flu,at Harvard College,in the fall and winter of 2009, just a few months ago.,We took 1,300 randomly selected undergraduates,,we had them nominate their friends,,and we followed both the random students and their friends,daily in time,to see whether or not they had the flu epidemic.,And we did this passively by looking at whether or not they'd gone to university health services.,And also, we had them [actively] email us a couple of times a week.,Exactly what we predicted happened.,So the random group is in the red line.,The epidemic in the friends group has shifted to the left, over here.,And the difference in the two is 16 days.,By monitoring the friends group,,we could get 16 days advance warning,of an impending epidemic in this human population. 
 Now, in addition to that,,if you were an analyst who was trying to study an epidemic,or to predict the adoption of a product, for example,,what you could do is you could pick a random sample of the population,,also have them nominate their friends and follow the friends,and follow both the randoms and the friends.,Among the friends, the first evidence you saw of a blip above zero,in adoption of the innovation, for example,,would be evidence of an impending epidemic.,Or you could see the first time the two curves diverged,,as shown on the left.,When did the randoms -- when did the friends take off,and leave the randoms,,and [when did] their curve start shifting?,And that, as indicated by the white line,,occurred 46 days,before the peak of the epidemic.,So this would be a technique,whereby we could get more than a month-and-a-half warning,about a flu epidemic in a particular population. 
 I should say that,how far advanced a notice one might get about something,depends on a host of factors.,It could depend on the nature of the pathogen --,different pathogens,,using this technique, you'd get different warning --,or other phenomena that are spreading,,or frankly, on the structure of the human network.,Now in our case, although it wasn't necessary,,we could also actually map the network of the students. 
 So, this is a map of 714 students,and their friendship ties.,And in a minute now, I'm going to put this map into motion.,We're going to take daily cuts through the network,for 120 days.,The red dots are going to be cases of the flu,,and the yellow dots are going to be friends of the people with the flu.,And the size of the dots is going to be proportional,to how many of their friends have the flu.,So bigger dots mean more of your friends have the flu.,And if you look at this image -- here we are now in September the 13th --,you're going to see a few cases light up.,You're going to see kind of blooming of the flu in the middle.,Here we are on October the 19th.,The slope of the epidemic curve is approaching now, in November.,Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang -- you're going to see lots of blooming in the middle,,and then you're going to see a sort of leveling off,,fewer and fewer cases towards the end of December.,And this type of a visualization,can show that epidemics like this take root,and affect central individuals first,,before they affect others. 
 Now, as I've been suggesting,,this method is not restricted to germs,,but actually to anything that spreads in populations.,Information spreads in populations,,norms can spread in populations,,behaviors can spread in populations.,And by behaviors, I can mean things like criminal behavior,,or voting behavior, or health care behavior,,like smoking, or vaccination,,or product adoption, or other kinds of behaviors,that relate to interpersonal influence.,If I'm likely to do something that affects others around me,,this technique can get early warning or early detection,about the adoption within the population.,The key thing is that for it to work,,there has to be interpersonal influence.,It cannot be because of some broadcast mechanism,affecting everyone uniformly. 
 Now the same insights,can also be exploited -- with respect to networks --,can also be exploited in other ways,,for example, in the use of targeting,specific people for interventions.,So, for example, most of you are probably familiar,with the notion of herd immunity.,So, if we have a population of a thousand people,,and we want to make the population immune to a pathogen,,we don't have to immunize every single person.,If we immunize 960 of them,,it's as if we had immunized a hundred [percent] of them.,Because even if one or two of the non-immune people gets infected,,there's no one for them to infect.,They are surrounded by immunized people.,So 96 percent is as good as 100 percent.,Well, some other scientists have estimated,what would happen if you took a 30 percent random sample,of these 1000 people, 300 people and immunized them.,Would you get any population-level immunity?,And the answer is no.,But if you took this 30 percent, these 300 people,and had them nominate their friends,and took the same number of vaccine doses,and vaccinated the friends of the 300 --,the 300 friends --,you can get the same level of herd immunity,as if you had vaccinated 96 percent of the population,at a much greater efficiency, with a strict budget constraint. 
 And similar ideas can be used, for instance,,to target distribution of things like bed nets,in the developing world.,If we could understand the structure of networks in villages,,we could target to whom to give the interventions,to foster these kinds of spreads.,Or, frankly, for advertising with all kinds of products.,If we could understand how to target,,it could affect the efficiency,of what we're trying to achieve.,And in fact, we can use data,from all kinds of sources nowadays [to do this]. 
 This is a map of eight million phone users,in a European country.,Every dot is a person, and every line represents,a volume of calls between the people.,And we can use such data, that's being passively obtained,,to map these whole countries,and understand who is located where within the network.,Without actually having to query them at all,,we can get this kind of a structural insight.,And other sources of information, as you're no doubt aware,are available about such features, from email interactions,,online interactions,,online social networks and so forth.,And in fact, we are in the era of what I would call,"massive-passive" data collection efforts.,They're all kinds of ways we can use massively collected data,to create sensor networks,to follow the population,,understand what's happening in the population,,and intervene in the population for the better.,Because these new technologies tell us,not just who is talking to whom,,but where everyone is,,and what they're thinking based on what they're uploading on the Internet,,and what they're buying based on their purchases.,And all this administrative data can be pulled together,and processed to understand human behavior,in a way we never could before. 
 So, for example, we could use truckers' purchases of fuel.,So the truckers are just going about their business,,and they're buying fuel.,And we see a blip up in the truckers' purchases of fuel,,and we know that a recession is about to end.,Or we can monitor the velocity,with which people are moving with their phones on a highway,,and the phone company can see,,as the velocity is slowing down,,that there's a traffic jam.,And they can feed that information back to their subscribers,,but only to their subscribers on the same highway,located behind the traffic jam!,Or we can monitor doctors prescribing behaviors, passively,,and see how the diffusion of innovation with pharmaceuticals,occurs within [networks of] doctors.,Or again, we can monitor purchasing behavior in people,and watch how these types of phenomena,can diffuse within human populations. 
 And there are three ways, I think,,that these massive-passive data can be used.,One is fully passive,,like I just described --,as in, for instance, the trucker example,,where we don't actually intervene in the population in any way.,One is quasi-active,,like the flu example I gave,,where we get some people to nominate their friends,and then passively monitor their friends --,do they have the flu, or not? -- and then get warning.,Or another example would be,,if you're a phone company, you figure out who's central in the network,and you ask those people, "Look, will you just text us your fever every day?,Just text us your temperature.",And collect vast amounts of information about people's temperature,,but from centrally located individuals.,And be able, on a large scale,,to monitor an impending epidemic,with very minimal input from people.,Or, finally, it can be more fully active --,as I know subsequent speakers will also talk about today --,where people might globally participate in wikis,,or photographing, or monitoring elections,,and upload information in a way that allows us to pool,information in order to understand social processes,and social phenomena. 
 In fact, the availability of these data, I think,,heralds a kind of new era,of what I and others would like to call,"computational social science.",It's sort of like when Galileo invented -- or, didn't invent --,came to use a telescope,and could see the heavens in a new way,,or Leeuwenhoek became aware of the microscope --,or actually invented --,and could see biology in a new way.,But now we have access to these kinds of data,that allow us to understand social processes,and social phenomena,in an entirely new way that was never before possible.,And with this science, we can,understand how exactly,the whole comes to be greater,than the sum of its parts.,And actually, we can use these insights,to improve society and improve human well-being. 
 Thank you.The story starts in Kenya,in December of 2007,,when there was a disputed presidential election,,and in the immediate aftermath of that election,,there was an outbreak of ethnic violence.,And there was a lawyer in Nairobi, Ory Okolloh --,who some of you may know from her TEDTalk --,who began blogging about it on her site,,Kenyan Pundit.,And shortly after the election and the outbreak of violence,,the government suddenly imposed,a significant media blackout.,And so weblogs went from being,commentary as part of the media landscape,to being a critical part of the media landscape,in trying to understand where the violence was.,And Okolloh solicited,from her commenters,more information about what was going on.,The comments began pouring in,,and Okolloh would collate them. She would post them.,And she quickly said, "It's too much.,I could do this all day every day,and I can't keep up.,There is more information,about what's going on in Kenya right now,than any one person can manage.,If only there was a way to automate this." 
 And two programmers who read her blog,held their hands up and said, "We could do that,",and in 72 hours, they launched Ushahidi.,Ushahidi -- the name means "witness",or "testimony" in Swahili --,is a very simple way of taking reports from the field,,whether it's from the web or, critically,,via mobile phones and SMS,,aggregating it and putting it on a map.,That's all it is, but that's all that's needed,because what it does is it takes the tacit information,available to the whole population --,everybody knows where the violence is,,but no one person knows what everyone knows --,and it takes that tacit information,and it aggregates it,,and it maps it and it makes it public.,And that, that maneuver,called "crisis mapping,",was kicked off in Kenya,in January of 2008. 
 And enough people looked at it and found it valuable enough,that the programmers who created Ushahidi,decided they were going to make it open source,and turn it into a platform.,It's since been deployed in Mexico,to track electoral fraud.,It's been deployed in Washington D.C. to track snow cleanup.,And it's been used most famously in Haiti,in the aftermath of the earthquake.,And when you look at the map,now posted on the Ushahidi front page,,you can see that the number of deployments in Ushahidi,has gone worldwide, all right?,This went from a single idea,and a single implementation,in East Africa in the beginning of 2008,to a global deployment,in less than three years. 
 Now what Okolloh did,would not have been possible,without digital technology.,What Okolloh did would not have been possible,without human generosity.,And the interesting moment now,,the number of environments,where the social design challenge,relies on both of those things being true.,That is the resource that I'm talking about.,I call it cognitive surplus.,And it represents the ability,of the world's population,to volunteer and to contribute and collaborate,on large, sometimes global, projects.,Cognitive surplus is made up of two things.,The first, obviously, is the world's free time and talents.,The world has over,a trillion hours a year,of free time,to commit to shared projects.,Now, that free time existed in the 20th century,,but we didn't get Ushahidi in the 20th century. 
 That's the second half of cognitive surplus.,The media landscape in the 20th century,was very good at helping people consume,,and we got, as a result,,very good at consuming.,But now that we've been given media tools --,the Internet, mobile phones -- that let us do more than consume,,what we're seeing is that people weren't couch potatoes,because we liked to be.,We were couch potatoes because that was,the only opportunity given to us.,We still like to consume, of course.,But it turns out we also like to create,,and we like to share.,And it's those two things together --,ancient human motivation,and the modern tools to allow that motivation,to be joined up in large-scale efforts --,that are the new design resource.,And using cognitive surplus,,we're starting to see truly incredible experiments,in scientific, literary,,artistic, political efforts.,Designing. 
 We're also getting, of course, a lot of LOLcats.,LOLcats are cute pictures of cats,made cuter with the addition of cute captions.,And they are also,part of the abundant media landscape we're getting now.,This is one of the participatory --,one of the participatory models,we see coming out of that, along with Ushahidi.,Now I want to stipulate, as the lawyers say,,that LOLcats are the stupidest possible,creative act.,There are other candidates of course,,but LOLcats will do as a general case.,But here's the thing:,The stupidest possible creative act,is still a creative act.,Someone who has done something like this,,however mediocre and throwaway,,has tried something, has put something forward in public.,And once they've done it, they can do it again,,and they could work on getting it better. 
 There is a spectrum between mediocre work and good work,,and as anybody who's worked as an artist or a creator knows,,it's a spectrum you're constantly,struggling to get on top of.,The gap is between,doing anything and doing nothing.,And someone who makes a LOLcat,has already crossed over that gap.,Now it's tempting to want to get the Ushahidis,without the LOLcats, right,,to get the serious stuff without the throwaway stuff.,But media abundance never works that way.,Freedom to experiment means freedom to experiment with anything.,Even with the sacred printing press,,we got erotic novels 150 years,before we got scientific journals. 
 So before I talk about,what is, I think, the critical difference,between LOLcats and Ushahidi,,I want to talk about,their shared source.,And that source is design for generosity.,It is one of the curiosities of our historical era,that even as cognitive surplus,is becoming a resource we can design around,,social sciences are also starting to explain,how important,our intrinsic motivations are to us,,how much we do things because we like to do them,rather than because our boss told us to do them,,or because we're being paid to do them. 
 This is a graph from a paper,by Uri Gneezy and Aldo Rustichini,,who set out to test, at the beginning of this decade,,what they called "deterrence theory.",And deterrence theory is a very simple theory of human behavior:,If you want somebody to do less of something,,add a punishment and they'll do less of it.,Simple, straightforward, commonsensical --,also, largely untested.,And so they went and studied,10 daycare centers in Haifa, Israel.,They studied those daycare centers,at the time of highest tension,,which is pick-up time.,At pick-up time the teachers,,who have been with your children all day,,would like you to be there at the appointed hour to take your children back.,Meanwhile, the parents -- perhaps a little busy at work, running late, running errands --,want a little slack to pick the kids up late. 
 So Gneezy and Rustichini said,,"How many instances of late pick-ups,are there at these 10 daycare centers?",Now they saw -- and this is what the graph is,,these are the number of weeks and these are the number of late arrivals --,that there were between six and 10,instances of late pick-ups,on average in these 10 daycare centers.,So they divided the daycare centers into two groups.,The white group there,is the control group; they change nothing.,But the group of daycare centers represented by the black line,,they said, "We are changing this bargain,as of right now.,If you pick your kid up more than 10 minutes late,,we're going to add a 10 shekel fine to your bill.,Boom. No ifs, ands or buts." 
 And the minute they did that,,the behavior in those daycare centers changed.,Late pick-ups went up,every week for the next four weeks,until they topped out at triple the pre-fine average,,and then they fluctuated,at between double and triple the pre-fine average,for the life of the fine.,And you can see immediately what happened, right?,The fine broke the culture,of the daycare center.,By adding a fine,,what they did was communicate to the parents,that their entire debt to the teachers,had been discharged,with the payment of 10 shekels,,and that there was no residue of guilt or social concern,that the parents owed the teachers.,And so the parents, quite sensibly, said,,"10 shekels to pick my kid up late?,What could be bad?",(Laughter) 
 The explanation of human behavior,that we inherited in the 20th century,was that we are all rational, self-maximizing actors,,and in that explanation --,the daycare center had no contract --,should have been operating without any constraints.,But that's not right.,They were operating with social constraints,rather than contractual ones.,And critically, the social constraints,created a culture that was more generous,than the contractual constraints did.,So Gneezy and Rustichini run this experiment for a dozen weeks --,run the fine for a dozen weeks --,and then they say, "Okay, that's it. All done; fine.",And then a really interesting thing happens:,Nothing changes.,The culture that got broken by the fine,stayed broken when the fine was removed.,Not only are economic motivations,and intrinsic motivations,incompatible,,that incompatibility,can persist over long periods.,So the trick,in designing these kinds of situations,is to understand where you're relying on,the economic part of the bargain -- as with the parents paying the teachers --,and when you're relying on the social part of the bargain,,when you're really designing for generosity. 
 This brings me back to the LOLcats,and to Ushahidi.,This is, I think, the range that matters.,Both of these rely on cognitive surplus.,Both of these design for the assumption,that people like to create and we want to share.,Here is the critical difference between these:,LOLcats is communal value.,It's value created by the participants,for each other.,Communal value on the networks we have,is everywhere --,every time you see a large aggregate,of shared, publicly available data,,whether it's photos on Flickr,or videos on Youtube or whatever.,This is good. I like LOLcats as much as the next guy,,maybe a little more even,,but this is also,a largely solved problem.,I have a hard time envisioning a future,in which someone is saying,,"Where, oh where, can I find a picture,of a cute cat?" 
 Ushahidi, by contrast,,is civic value.,It's value created by the participants,but enjoyed by society as a whole.,The goals set out by Ushahidi,are not just to make life better,for the participants,,but to make life better for everyone in the society,in which Ushahidi is operating.,And that kind of civic value,is not just a side effect,of opening up to human motivation.,It really is going to be a side effect,of what we, collectively,,make of these kinds of efforts.,There are a trillion,hours a year,of participatory value,up for grabs.,That will be true year-in and year-out.,The number of people who are going to be able,to participate in these kinds of projects,is going to grow,,and we can see that organizations,designed around a culture of generosity,can achieve incredible effects,without an enormous amount of contractual overhead --,a very different model,than our default model for large-scale group action in the 20th century. 
 What's going to make the difference here,is what Dean Kamen said,,the inventor and entrepreneur.,Kamen said, "Free cultures get what they celebrate.",We've got a choice before us.,We've got this trillion hours a year.,We can use it to crack each other up, and we're going to do that.,That, we get for free.,But we can also celebrate,and support and reward the people,trying to use cognitive surplus,to create civic value.,And to the degree we're going to do that, to the degree we're able to do that,,we'll be able to change society. 
 Thank you very much.This is the ocean as I used to know it.,And I find that since I've beennin the Gulf a couple of times,,I really kind of am traumatizednbecause whenever I look at the ocean now,,no matter where I am,,even where I knownthat none of the oil has gone,,I sort of see slicks,,and I'm finding that I'm very muchnhaunted by it.,But what I want to talk to you about today,is a lot of things that trynto put all of this in context,,not just about the oil eruption,nbut what it means and why it has happened. 
 First, just a little bit about me.,I'm basically just a guynthat likes to go fishing,ever since I was a little kid,nand because I did,,I wound up studying sea birds,to try to stay in the coastal habitatsnthat I so loved.,And now I mainly write booksnabout how the ocean is changing,,and the ocean is certainlynchanging very rapidly.,Now we saw this graphic earlier on,nthat we really live on a hard marble,that has just a slight bitnof wetness to it.,It's like you dipped a marble in water.,And the same thing with the atmosphere:,If you took all the atmospherenand rolled it up in a ball,,you would get that little spherenof gas on the right.,So we live on the most fragilenlittle soap bubble you can imagine,,a very sacred soap bubble,nbut one that is very, very easy to affect. 
 And all the burning of oil and coalnand gas, all the fossil fuels,,have changed the atmosphere greatly.,Carbon dioxide levelnhas gone up and up and up.,We're warming the climate.,So the blowout in the Gulf,is just a little piecenof a much larger problem,that we have with the energynthat we use to run civilization.,Beyond warming,,we have the problemnof the oceans getting more acidified --,and already measurably so,nand already affecting animals.,Now in the laboratory, if you take a clamnand you put it in the pH that is not 8.1,,which is the normal pHnof seawater, but 7.5,,it dissolves in about three days.,If you take a sea urchin larva from 8.1,,put it in a pH of 7.7 --nnot a huge change --,it becomes deformed and dies.,Already, commercial oyster larvaenare dying at large scales in some places.,Coral reefs are growing slowernin some places because of this problem.,So this really matters. 
 Now, let's take a little tournaround the Gulf a little bit.,One of the things that really impresses menabout the people in the Gulf:,They are really, really aquatic people.,And they can handle water.,They can handle a hurricanenthat comes and goes.,When the water goes down,nthey know what to do.,But when it's something other than water,nand their water habitat changes,,they don't have many options.,In fact, those entire communitiesnreally don't have many options.,They don't have another thing they can do.,They can't go and worknin the local hotel business,because there isn't onenin their community. 
 If you go to the Gulf and you look around,nyou do see a lot of oil.,You see a lot of oil on the ocean.,You see a lot of oil on the shoreline.,If you go to the site of the blowout,nit looks pretty unbelievable.,It looks like you just emptiednthe oil pan in your car,,and you just dumped it in the ocean.,And one of the reallynmost incredible things, I think,,is that there's nobody out therentrying to collect it,at the site where it is densest.,Parts of the ocean therenlook just absolutely apocalyptic.,You go in along the shore,nyou can find it everywhere.,It's really messy.,If you go to the placesnwhere it's just arriving,,like the eastern partnof the Gulf, in Alabama,,there's still people using the beach,while there are peoplencleaning up the beach.,And they have a very strangenway of cleaning up the beach.,They're not allowed to putnmore than 10 pounds of sand,in a 50-gallon plastic bag.,They have thousandsnand thousands of plastic bags.,I don't know what they'll donwith all that stuff.,Meanwhile, there are stillnpeople trying to use the beach.,They don't see the signnthat says: "Stay out of the water.",Their kids are in the water;,they're getting tar all overntheir clothes and their sandals--,It's a mess.,If you go to where the oil has beennfor a while, it's an even bigger mess.,And there's basicallynnobody there anymore,,a few people trying to keep using it. 
 You see people who are reallynshell-shocked.,They are very hardworking people.,All they know about lifenis they get up in the morning,,and if their engine starts,nthey go to work.,They always felt thatnthey could rely on the assurances,that nature brought themnthrough the ecosystem of the Gulf.,They're finding that their worldnis really collapsing.,And so you can see, literally,nsigns of their shock ...,signs of their outrage ...,signs of their anger ...,and signs of their grief.,These are the things that you can see. 
 There's a lot you can't see,nalso, underwater.,What's going on underwater?,Well, some people saynthere are oil plumes.,Some people say there are not oil plumes.,And Congressman Markey asks, you know,,"Is it going to take a submarine ridento see if there are really oil plumes?",But I couldn't take a submarine ride --,especially between the time I knewnI was coming here and today --,so I had to do a little experiment myself,to see if there was oilnin the Gulf of Mexico.,So this is the Gulf of Mexico ...,sparkling place full of fish.,And I created a little oil spillnin the Gulf of Mexico.,And I learned, in fact,nI confirmed the hypothesis,that oil and water don't mix ...,until you add a dispersant ...,and then ...,they start mixing.,And you add a little energynfrom the wind and the waves,,and you get a big mess,,a big mess that you can't possibly clean,,you can't touch, you can't extract,and, I think most importantly --nthis is what I think --,you can't see it.,I think it's being hidden on purpose.,Now this is such a catastrophenand such a mess,that lots of stuff is leaking outnon the edges of the information stream.,But as many people have said,,there's a large attemptnto suppress what's going on.,Personally, I think that the dispersantsnare a major strategy to hide the body,,because we put the murderernin charge of the crime scene.,But you can see it.,You can see where the oilnis concentrated at the surface,,and then it is attacked,,because they don't wantnthe evidence, in my opinion. 
 OK.,We heard that bacteria eat oil?,So do sea turtles.,When it breaks up,,it has a long way to gonbefore it gets down to bacteria.,Turtles eat it.nIt gets in the gills of fish.,These guys have to swim around through it.,I heard the most incredible story todaynwhen I was on the train coming here.,A writer named Ted Williams called me,,and he was asking mena couple of questions about what I saw,,because he's writing an articlenfor Audubon magazine.,He said that he had been in the Gulfna little while ago; like about a week ago,,and a guy who hadnbeen a recreational fishing guide,took him out to show him what's going on.,That guide's entire calendar yearnis canceled bookings.,He has no bookings left.,Everybody wanted their deposit back,neverybody is fleeing.,That's the story of thousands of people.,But he told Tednthat on the last day he went out,,a bottlenose dolphinnsuddenly appeared next to the boat,,and it was splattering oilnout its blowhole.,And he moved awaynbecause it was his last fishing trip,,and he knew that the dolphins scare fish.,So he moved away from it,nturned around a few minutes later,,it was right next to the sidenof the boat again.,He said that in 30 years of fishingnhe had never seen a dolphin do that.,And he felt that -- 
 (Sigh) 
 he felt that it wasncoming to ask for help.,Sorry. 
 Now, in the Exxon Valdez spill,,about 30 percent of the killer whalesndied in the first few months.,Their numbers have never recovered.,So the recovery rate of all this stuffnis going to be variable.,It's going to take longer for some things.,And some things, I think,nwill probably come back a little faster.,The other thing about the Gulfnthat is important,is that there are a lot of animalsnthat concentrate in the Gulf,at certain parts of the year.,So the Gulf is a reallynimportant piece of water --,more important than a similar volumenof water in the open Atlantic Ocean.,These tuna swim the entire ocean.,They get in the Gulf Stream,nthey go all the way to Europe.,When it comes time to spawn,nthey come inside,,and these two tuna that were tagged,,you can see them on the spawning grounds,very much right in the area of the slick.,They're probably having,nat the very least,,a catastrophic spawning season this year.,I'm hoping that maybe the adultsnare avoiding that dirty water.,They don't usually like to go into waternthat is very cloudy anyway.,But these are reallynhigh-performance athletic animals.,I don't know what this kind of stuffnwill do in their gills.,I don't know if it'll affect the adults.,If it's not, it's certainly affectingntheir eggs and larvae,,I would certainly think.,But if you look at that graphnthat goes down and down and down,,that's what we've done to this speciesnthrough overfishing over many decades. 
 So while the oil spill, the leak,nthe eruption, is a catastrophe,,I think it's important to keep in mind,that we've done a lot to affectnwhat's in the ocean, for a very long time.,It's not like we're startingnwith something that's been OK.,We're starting with somethingnthat's had a lot of stresses,and a lot of problems to begin with.,If you look around at the birds,nthere are a lot of birds in the Gulf,that concentrate in the Gulfnat certain times of the year,,but then leave.,And they populate much larger areas.,For instance, most of the birdsnin this picture are migratory birds.,They were all on the Gulf in May,,while oil was startingnto come ashore in certain places.,Down on the lower left therenare ruddy turnstones and sanderlings.,They breed in the High Arctic,,and they winterndown in southern South America.,But they concentrate in the Gulfnand then fan out all across the Arctic.,I saw birds that breednin Greenland, in the Gulf.,So this is a hemispheric issue.,The economic effectsngo at least nationally in many ways.,The biological effectsnare certainly hemispheric. 
 I think that this is one of the mostnabsolutely mind-boggling examples,of total unpreparednessnthat I can even think of.,Even when the Japanesenbombed Pearl Harbor,,at least they shot back.,And we just seem to be unablento figure out what to do.,There was nothing ready,,and, you know, as we can seenby what they're doing.,Mainly what they're doingnis booms and dispersants.,The booms are absolutelynnot made for open water.,They don't even attempt to corralnthe oil where it is most concentrated.,They get near shore --nLook at these two boats.,That one on the rightnis called Fishing Fool.,And I think, you know, that's a great name,for boats that thinknthat they're going to do anything,to make a dent in this,nby dragging a boom between them,when there are literallynhundreds of thousands of square miles,in the Gulf right nownwith oil at the surface. 
 The dispersants make the oilngo right under the booms.,The booms are onlynabout 13 inches in diameter.,So it's just absolutely crazy.,Here are shrimp boats employed.,There are hundreds of shrimp boatsnemployed to drag booms instead of nets.,Here they are working.,You can see easily,that all the oily waternjust goes over the back of the boom.,All they're doing is stirring it.,It's just ridiculous.,Also, for all the shorelinenthat has booms --,hundreds and hundredsnof miles of shoreline --,all of the shoreline that has booms,,there's adjacent shorelinenthat doesn't have any booms.,There is ample opportunity for oilnand dirty water to get in behind them. 
 And that lower photo,nthat's a bird colony that has been boomed.,Everybody's trying to protectnthe bird colonies there.,Well, as an ornithologist,nI can tell you that birds fly, and that -- 
 (Laughter) 
 and that booming a bird colonyndoesn't do it; it doesn't do it.,These birds make a livingnby diving into the water.,In fact ...,really what I thinknthey should do, if anything --,they're trying so hardnto protect those nests --,actually, if they destroyednevery single nest,,some of the birds would leave,,and that would be betternfor them this year.,As far as cleaning them ...,I don't mean to cast any aspersionnon people cleaning birds.,It's really, really importantnthat we express our compassion.,I think that's the most importantnthing that people have, is compassion.,It's really importantnto get those images and to show it.,But really, where are those birdsngoing to get released to?,It's like taking somebodynout of a burning building,,treating them for smoke inhalation,and sending them back into the building,nbecause the oil is still gushing. 
 I refuse to acknowledge thisnas anything like an accident.,I think that this is the resultnof gross negligence. 
 (Applause) 
 Not just BP.,BP operated very sloppilynand very recklessly because they could.,And they were allowed to do so,because of the absolute failurenof oversight of the government,that is supposed to benour government, protecting us.,It turns out that --,you see this sign on every commercialnvessel in the United States --,you know, if you spilledna couple of gallons of oil,,you would be in big trouble.,And you have to really wondernwho are the laws made for,,and who has gotten above the laws.,And there are thingsnthat we can do in the future.,We could have the kinds of equipmentnthat we would really need.,It would not takenan awful lot to anticipate,that after making 30,000 holes,in the sea floor of the Gulfnof Mexico looking for oil,,oil might start coming out of one of them.,And you'd have some idea of what to do.,That's certainlynone of the things we need to do. 
 But I think we have to understandnwhere this leak really started from.,It really started from the destructionnof the idea that the government is there,because it's our government,,meant to protectnthe larger public interest.,So I think that the oil blowout,nthe bank bailout,,the mortgage crisis and all these thingsnare absolutely symptoms of the same cause.,We still seem to understand that at least,,we need the police to protect usnfrom a few bad people.,And even though the policencan be a little annoying at times --,giving us tickets and stuff like that --,nobody says that we shouldnjust get rid of them.,But in the entire restnof government right now,and for the last at least 30 years,,there has been a culture of deregulation,that is caused directly by the peoplenwho we need to be protected from,,buying the government out from under us. 
 (Applause) 
 Now this has been a problemnfor a very, very long time.,You can see that corporations were illegalnat the founding of America,,and even Thomas Jefferson complained,that they were already bidding defiancento the laws of our country.,OK, people who say they're conservative,,if they really wanted to benreally conservative and patriotic,,they would tellnthese corporations to go to hell.,That's what it would really meannto be conservative.,So what we really need to donis regain the idea,that it's our governmentnsafeguarding our interests,,and regain a sense of unitynand common cause in our country,that really has been lost.,I think there are signs of hope. 
 We seem to be waking up a little bit.,The Glass-Steagall Act --nwhich was really to protect us,from the kind of thingnthat caused the recession to happen,,and the bank meltdown and all that stuffnthat required the bailouts --,that was put in effect in 1933,nwas systematically destroyed.,Now there's a mood to putnsome of that stuff back in place,,but the lobbyists are already therentrying to weaken the regulations,after the legislation has just passed.,So it's a continued fight.,It's a historic moment right now.,We're either going to have an absolutelynunmitigated catastrophe,of this oil leak in the Gulf,,or we will make the momentnwe need out of this,,as many people have noted today.,There's certainly a common theme,about needing to makenthe moment out of this. 
 We've been through this beforenwith other ways of offshore drilling.,The first offshore wellsnwere called whales.,The first offshore drillsnwere called harpoons.,We emptied the oceannof the whales at that time.,Now are we stuck with this?,Ever since we lived in caves,nevery time we wanted any energy,,we lit something on fire,nand that is still what we're doing.,We're still lighting something on firenevery time we want energy. 
 And people say we can't have clean energy,because it's too expensive.,Who says it's too expensive?,People who sell us fossil fuels.,We've been here before with energy,,and people saying the economyncannot withstand a switch,,because the cheapest energy was slavery.,Energy is always a moral issue.,It's an issue that is moral right now.,It's a matter of right and wrong. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)So I'm going to talk to you about you about the political chemistry of oil spills,and why this is an incredibly important,,long, oily, hot summer,,and why we need to keep ourselves from getting distracted.,But before I talk about the political chemistry,,I actually need to talk about the chemistry of oil. 
 This is a photograph from when I visited,Prudhoe Bay in Alaska in 2002,to watch the Minerals Management Service,testing their ability,to burn oil spills in ice.,And what you see here is, you see a little bit of crude oil,,you see some ice cubes,,and you see two sandwich baggies of napalm.,The napalm is burning there quite nicely.,And the thing is, is that,oil is really an abstraction for us as the American consumer.,We're four percent of the world's population;,we use 25 percent of the world's oil production.,And we don't really understand what oil is,,until you check out its molecules,,And you don't really understand that until you see this stuff burn.,So this is what happens as that burn gets going.,It takes off. It's a big woosh.,I highly recommend that you get a chance to see crude oil burn someday,,because you will never need to hear another poli sci lecture,on the geopolitics of oil again.,It'll just bake your retinas.,So there it is; the retinas are baking. 
 Let me tell you a little bit about this chemistry of oil.,Oil is a stew of hydrocarbon molecules.,It starts of with the very small ones,,which are one carbon, four hydrogen --,that's methane -- it just floats off.,Then there's all sorts of intermediate ones with middle amounts of carbon.,You've probably heard of benzene rings; they're very carcinogenic.,And it goes all the way over,to these big, thick, galumphy ones that have hundreds of carbons,,and they have thousands of hydrogens,,and they have vanadium and heavy metals and sulfur,and all kinds of craziness hanging off the sides of them.,Those are called the asphaltenes; they're an ingredient in asphalt.,They're very important in oil spills. 
 Let me tell you a little bit about,the chemistry of oil in water.,It is this chemistry that makes oil so disastrous.,Oil doesn't sink, it floats.,If it sank, it would be a whole different story as far as an oil spill.,And the other thing it does is it spreads out the moment it hits the water.,It spreads out to be really thin,,so you have a hard time corralling it.,The next thing that happens,is the light ends evaporate,,and some of the toxic things float into the water column,and kill fish eggs,and smaller fish and things like that, and shrimp.,And then the asphaltenes -- and this is the crucial thing --,the asphaltenes get whipped by the waves,into a frothy emulsion, something like mayonnaise.,It triples the amount,of oily, messy goo that you have in the water,,and it makes it very hard to handle.,It also makes it very viscous.,When the Prestige sank off the coast of Spain,,there were big, floating cushions the size of sofa cushions,of emulsified oil,,with the consistency, or the viscosity, of chewing gum.,It's incredibly hard to clean up.,And every single oil is different when it hits water. 
 When the chemistry of the oil and water,also hits our politics,,it's absolutely explosive.,For the first time, American consumers,will kind of see the oil supply chain in front of themselves.,They have a "eureka!" moment,,when we suddenly understand oil in a different context.,So I'm going to talk just a little bit about the origin of these politics,,because it's really crucial to understanding,why this summer is so important, why we need to stay focused.,Nobody gets up in the morning and thinks,,"Wow! I'm going to go buy,some three-carbon-to-12-carbon molecules to put in my tank,and drive happily to work.",No, they think, "Ugh. I have to go buy gas.,I'm so angry about it. The oil companies are ripping me off.,They set the prices, and I don't even know.,I am helpless over this.",And this is what happens to us at the gas pump --,and actually, gas pumps are specifically designed,to diffuse that anger.,You might notice that many gas pumps, including this one,,are designed to look like ATMs.,I've talked to engineers. That's specifically to diffuse our anger,,because supposedly we feel good about ATMs.,(Laughter),That shows you how bad it is. 
 But actually, I mean, this feeling of helplessness,comes in because most Americans actually feel,that oil prices are the result of a conspiracy,,not of the vicissitudes of the world oil market.,And the thing is, too,,is that we also feel very helpless about the amount that we consume,,which is somewhat reasonable,,because in fact, we have designed this system,where, if you want to get a job,,it's much more important to have a car that runs,,to have a job and keep a job, than to have a GED.,And that's actually very perverse. 
 Now there's another perverse thing about the way we buy gas,,which is that we'd rather be doing anything else.,This is BP's gas station,in downtown Los Angeles.,It is green. It is a shrine to greenishness.,"Now," you think, "why would something so lame,work on people so smart?",Well, the reason is, is because, when we're buying gas,,we're very invested in this sort of cognitive dissonance.,I mean, we're angry at the one hand and we want to be somewhere else.,We don't want to be buying oil;,we want to be doing something green.,And we get kind of in on our own con.,I mean -- and this is funny,,it looks funny here.,But in fact, that's why the slogan "beyond petroleum" worked.,But it's an inherent part of our energy policy,,which is we don't talk about,reducing the amount of oil that we use.,We talk about energy independence. We talk about hydrogen cars.,We talk about biofuels that haven't been invented yet.,And so, cognitive dissonance,is part and parcel of the way that we deal with oil,,and it's really important to dealing with this oil spill. 
 Okay, so the politics of oil,are very moral in the United States.,The oil industry is like a huge, gigantic octopus,of engineering and finance,and everything else,,but we actually see it in very moral terms.,This is an early-on photograph -- you can see, we had these gushers.,Early journalists looked at these spills,,and they said, "This is a filthy industry.",But they also saw in it,that people were getting rich for doing nothing.,They weren't farmers, they were just getting rich for stuff coming out of the ground.,It's the "Beverly Hillbillies," basically.,But in the beginning, this was seen as a very morally problematic thing,,long before it became funny. 
 And then, of course, there was John D. Rockefeller.,And the thing about John D. is that,he went into this chaotic wild-east,of oil industry,,and he rationalized it,into a vertically integrated company, a multinational.,It was terrifying; you think Walmart is a terrifying business model now,,imagine what this looked like in the 1860s or 1870s.,And it also the kind of root,of how we see oil as a conspiracy.,But what's really amazing is that,Ida Tarbell, the journalist,,went in and did a big exposé of Rockefeller,and actually got the whole antitrust laws,put in place.,But in many ways,,that image of the conspiracy still sticks with us.,And here's one of the things,that Ida Tarbell said --,she said, "He has a thin nose like a thorn.,There were no lips.,There were puffs under the little colorless eyes,with creases running from them.",(Laughter),Okay, so that guy is actually still with us.,(Laughter),I mean, this is a very pervasive -- this is part of our DNA.,And then there's this guy, okay. 
 So, you might be wondering why it is that,,every time we have high oil prices or an oil spill,,we call these CEOs down to Washington,,and we sort of pepper them with questions in public and we try to shame them.,And this is something that we've been doing since 1974,,when we first asked them, "Why are there these obscene profits?",And we've sort of personalized the whole oil industry,into these CEOs.,And we take it as, you know --,we look at it on a moral level,,rather than looking at it on a legal and financial level.,And so I'm not saying these guys aren't liable to answer questions --,I'm just saying that, when you focus on,whether they are or are not a bunch of greedy bastards,,you don't actually get around to the point,of making laws that are either going to either change the way they operate,,or you're going to get around,to really reducing the amount of oil,and reducing our dependence on oil.,So I'm saying this is kind of a distraction.,But it makes for good theater,,and it's powerfully cathartic as you probably saw last week. 
 So the thing about water oil spills,is that they are very politically galvanizing.,I mean, these pictures -- this is from the Santa Barbara spill.,You have these pictures of birds.,They really influence people.,When the Santa Barbara spill happened in 1969,,it formed the environmental movement in its modern form.,It started Earth Day.,It also put in place the National Environmental Policy Act,,the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act.,Everything that we are really stemmed from this period.,I think it's important to kind of look at these pictures of the birds,and understand what happens to us.,Here we are normally;,we're standing at the gas pump, and we're feeling kind of helpless.,We look at these pictures,and we understand, for the first time, our role in this supply chain.,We connect the dots in the supply chain.,And we have this kind of --,as voters, we have kind of a "eureka!" moment.,This is why these moments of these oil spills,are so important.,But it's also really important that we don't get distracted,by the theater or the morals of it.,We actually need to go in,and work on the roots of the problem. 
 One of the things that happened with the two previous oil spills,was that we really worked on some of the symptoms.,We were very reactive, as opposed to being proactive,about what happened.,And so what we did was, actually,,we made moratoriums on the east and west coasts on drilling.,We stopped drilling in ANWR,,but we didn't actually reduce the amount of oil that we consumed.,In fact, it's continued to increase.,The only thing that really reduces the amount of oil that we consume,is much higher prices.,As you can see, our own production has fallen off,as our reservoirs have gotten old and expensive to drill out.,We only have two percent of the world's oil reserves;,65 percent of them are in the Persian Gulf. 
 One of the things that's happened because of this,is that, since 1969,,the country of Nigeria, or the part of Nigeria that pumps oil,,which is the delta -- which is two times the size of Maryland --,has had thousands of oil spills a year.,I mean, we've essentially been exporting oil spills,when we import oil from places,without tight environmental regulations.,That has been the equivalent of an Exxon Valdez spill,every year since 1969.,And we can wrap our heads around the spills,,because that's what we see here,,but in fact, these guys actually live in a war zone.,There's a thousand battle-related deaths a year,in this area twice the size of Maryland,,and it's all related to the oil.,And these guys, I mean, if they were in the U.S.,,they might be actually here in this room.,They have degrees in political science, degrees in business --,they're entrepreneurs. They don't actually want to be doing what they're doing.,And it's sort of one of the other groups of people,who pay a price for us. 
 The other thing that we've done,,as we've continued to increase demand,,is that we kind of play a shell game with the costs.,One of the places we put in a big oil project,in Chad, with Exxon.,So the U.S. taxpayer paid for it;,the World Bank, Exxon paid for it.,We put it in. There was a tremendous banditry problem.,I was there in 2003.,We were driving along this dark, dark road,,and the guy in the green stepped out,,and I was just like, "Ahhh! This is it.",And then the guy in the Exxon uniform stepped out,,and we realized it was okay.,They have their own private sort of army around them at the oil fields.,But at the same time,,Chad has become much more unstable,,and we are not paying for that price at the pump.,We pay for it in our taxes on April 15th. 
 We do the same thing,with the price of policing the Persian Gulf,and keeping the shipping lanes open.,This is 1988 --,we actually bombed two Iranian oil platforms that year.,That was the beginning of an escalating U.S. involvement there,that we do not pay for at the pump.,We pay for it on April 15th,,and we can't even calculate the cost of this involvement.,The other place that is sort of supporting our dependence on oil,and our increased consumption,is the Gulf of Mexico,,which was not part of the moratoriums.,Now what's happened in the Gulf of Mexico -- as you can see,,this is the Minerals Management diagram,of wells for gas and oil.,It's become this intense industrialized zone.,It doesn't have the same resonance for us,that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has,,but it should, I mean, it's a bird sanctuary.,Also, every time you buy gasoline in the United States,,half of it is actually being refined along the coast,,because the Gulf actually has,about 50 percent of our refining capacity,and a lot of our marine terminals as well.,So the people of the Gulf have essentially been subsidizing the rest of us,through a less-clean environment. 
 And finally, American families also pay a price for oil.,Now on the one hand, the price at the pump is not really very high,when you consider the actual cost of the oil,,but on the other hand,,the fact that people have no other transit options,means that they pay a large amount of their income,into just getting back and forth to work,,generally in a fairly crummy car.,If you look at people who make $50,000 a year, they have two kids,,they might have three jobs or more,,and then they have to really commute.,They're actually spending more on their car and fuel,than they are on taxes or on health care.,And the same thing happens,at the 50th percentile, around 80,000.,Gasoline costs are a tremendous drain,on the American economy,,but they're also a drain on individual families,and it's kind of terrifying to think about what happens when prices get higher. 
 So, what I'm going to talk to you about now is:,what do we have to do this time?,What are the laws? What do we have to do to keep ourselves focused?,One thing is -- we need to stay away from the theater.,We need to stay away from the moratoriums.,We need to focus really back again,on the molecules.,The moratoriums are fine, but we do need to focus,on the molecules on the oil.,One of the things that we also need to do,,is we need to try to not kind of fool ourselves,into thinking that you can have a green world,,before you reduce the amount of oil that we use.,We need to focus on reducing the oil. 
 What you see in this top drawing is a schematic,of how petroleum gets used in the U.S. economy.,It comes in on the side -- the useful stuff is the dark gray,,and the un-useful stuff,,which is called the rejected energy -- the waste,,goes up to the top.,Now you can see that the waste far outweighs,the actually useful amount.,And one of the things that we need to do,is, not only fix the fuel efficiency of our vehicles,and make them much more efficient,,but we also need to fix the economy in general. 
 We need to remove the perverse incentives to use more fuel.,For example, we have an insurance system,where the person who drives 20,000 miles a year,pays the same insurance as somebody who drives 3,000.,We actually encourage people to drive more.,We have policies that reward sprawl -- we have all kinds of policies.,We need to have more mobility choices.,We need to make the gas price,better reflect the real cost of oil.,And we need to shift subsidies from the oil industry,,which is at least 10 billion dollars a year,,into something that allows middle-class people to find better ways to commute.,Whether that's getting a much more efficient car,and also kind of building markets,for new cars and new fuels down the road,,this is where we need to be.,We need to kind of rationalize this whole thing,,and you can find more about this policy.,It's called STRONG, which is "Secure Transportation,Reducing Oil Needs Gradually,",and the idea is instead of being helpless, we need to be more strong.,They're up at NewAmerica.net.,What's important about these,is that we try to move,from feeling helpless at the pump,,to actually being active,and to really sort of thinking about who we are,,having kind of that special moment,,where we connect the dots actually at the pump. 
 Now supposedly, oil taxes,are the third rail of American politics -- the no-fly zone.,I actually -- I agree that a dollar a gallon on oil,is probably too much,,but I think that if we started this year,with three cents a gallon on gasoline,,and upped it to six cents next year, nine cents the following year,,all the way up to 30 cents by 2020,,that we could actually significantly reduce our gasoline consumption,,and at the same time we would give people time to prepare,,time to respond,,and we would be raising money and raising consciousness at the same time.,Let me give you a little sense of how this would work. 
 This is a gas receipt, hypothetically, for a year from now.,The first thing that you have on the tax is --,you have a tax for a stronger America -- 33 cents.,So you're not helpless at the pump.,And the second thing that you have is a kind of warning sign,,very similar to what you would find,on a cigarette pack.,And what it says is, "The National Academy of Sciences,estimates that every gallon of gas you burn in your car,creates 29 cents in health care costs.",That's a lot.,And so this -- you can see that you're paying considerably less,than the health care costs on the tax.,And also, the hope is that,you start to be connected to the whole greater system.,And at the same time, you have a number that you can call,to get more information on commuting,,or a low-interest loan on a different kind of car,,or whatever it is you're going to need,to actually reduce your gasoline dependence.,With this whole sort of suite of policies,,we could actually reduce our gasoline consumption --,or our oil consumption --,by 20 percent by 2020.,So, three million barrels a day. 
 But in order to do this,,one of the things we really need to do, is we need to remember,we are people of the hydrocarbon.,We need to keep or minds on the molecules,and not get distracted by the theater,,not get distracted by the cognitive dissonance,of the green possibilities that are out there.,We need to kind of get down and do the gritty work,of reducing our dependence upon this fuel and these molecules. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I am a marine toxicologist,,and I've been very, very concerned about the Gulf,,particularly about the massive applications,of the toxic dispersants,,the Corexits.,I've been working on ocean pollution,for quite a long time --,the impacts on marine life and particularly the impacts,on marine mammals.,As it turns out, marine mammals,are at the top of this food chain,that we're pouring millions of tons,of toxic substances into,every year.,And they are showing the signs of this.,I'm sorry to have a sad slide like this,,but not everything is all that happy,,especially in my work.,They are loaded,with toxic chemicals in their body,,hundreds of compounds,,all kinds of compounds -- it's staggering.,And they're dying off rather regularly,,tens of thousands around the world.,It's predicted they may go extinct --,about a third of them --,within about 30 years. 
 So my project is along the Northwest Atlantic.,It's called Seals as Sentinels.,We're tracking pollution,at the top of the food web, in marine mammals and fish.,It's a region-wide,,eco-toxicological investigation.,We're looking at a lot of compounds,,but recently been quite interested in,the flame retardants, the brominated flame retardants,that are in many, many things,that we use in our everyday life,,from the cushions in the chairs,we're all sitting on,to the plastic casings of our computers,,our television sets and so on.,So we are tracking,how do these things get from,the products into the ocean,,which is the final sink for them.,And there's quite a complicated pathway for that,because, as these products age,,they get concentrated in dust,,and then they also get thrown out, so they go to the landfills.,They wind up in waste water treatment plants.,As you all know, we throw out billions,of computers and TVs every year.,And those go to e-waste dumps.,And all that gets into surface waters,,eventually reaching the ocean, the final sink.,So, in our study,,we did find quite high levels, as we expected,,of these flame retardants in the harbor seals' bodies.,And we reported this.,It led to a ban of this neuro-toxic flame retardant,called Deca in Maine, where I am based,,and also then a phase-out,,U.S.-wide, at the end of last year.,But we said, well, on the bright side,,our harbor seals at least will not be,bursting into flame anytime soon. 
 So then I got really curious,,myself, as a toxicologist,,and I donated some blood to my lab,and said, "Okay, let's do it.",Well, we detected 113 different compounds,in my blood.,And I must say, if any of you would have this done,,you'd probably find a similar profile,,or cocktail, as they call it.,But I was the recipient,of a lot of flame retardant material for some reason.,And just to point out the levels --,Americans have 10 to 40 times higher,levels of these compounds in our bodies,than the Europeans.,Why? Because we are flame-retarding everything,,and we have weak regulations,for toxic chemicals.,But lo and behold, I'm one of the high-end individuals.,Lucky me.,But then I thought,,well, in case of a fire, I might be the last one to ignite. 
 (Laughter) 
 So anyway, here's the problem --,and it is a problem that we're looking at in the Gulf today --,we're not regulating chemicals in this country properly.,We're hardly regulating them at all.,And we're letting industry run the show.,And Jackie Savitz spoke this morning,about Big Oil,and the propaganda,and how we're all brainwashed,with their, you know, lies and so forth.,Well, Big Chemical,is what we're dealing with here.,And they're allowed to keep trade secrets,,so they don't even give the ingredients out.,Plus they don't give health and safety data,,so, consequently, they cannot be regulated,before they go to market.,So it's a case of innocent until proven guilty.,The burden of proof is not on the producer. 
 So I then was invited to go,to the Gulf in May.,I went down there on,a preliminary investigation,to look into dispersants,and how they're going into the water column and so forth.,And I was told that I was,the only toxicologist to date,who was dumb enough to get into the water,,but I did.,And we dove in the slick,without even HazMat gear.,And I did get sick.,I got a ferocious sore throat two days later.,I felt like my throat was on fire.,But it did pass.,And what I did see in the water as we went down,,what really shocked me -- and it's haunted me ever since --,because I could see the droplets of oil dispersing.,And as you go down, they're catching all kinds of plankton,,bumping into,,you know, little wisps of life,that are the food for the planktivores,,the herring kind of fish.,And you could just see the web of death,as you go down in the water column. 
 Well, you know, we got into this,in the beginning,as a trade-off, they say,,between the wetlands versus the ocean depth.,And I didn't agree with that,decision at the time; I still don't.,The decision was to protect the marshes.,When the oil gets into the marshes, you can't get it out.,And as you know, there's been a very weak response,,up until recently,,to actually collect the oil.,It's gotten much more aggressive.,This is an Exxon slide showing what happens,,the scenario and the trade-off.,So this shows oil on the surface.,You can see it getting up into the mangrove,,but it is not harming the corals,or the sea grass, right.,So here we have the other scenario.,If you disperse, the sea grass and the corals,are getting hit pretty hard,,but you're saving the mangrove.,So this, to me, is like going to the eye doctor, okay?,Is it better with one or two? 
 (Laughter) 
 The problem is that we have,released so darn much of this stuff,,we're climbing up to two million gallons,very quickly.,And then there's the problem of the plumes.,What plumes?,It turns out there are plumes.,Independent researchers found that.,And then there's the looming,,messy problem of human health,,reported human health effects.,And actually, one of our federal officials,said that it was probably heat stress. So ...,Having been in that water,just for the short time I was there,,I can tell you, it is not heat stress.,There are volumes of volatile,petroleum fumes coming off that water,,plus the Corexit,,which has solvent in it.,So it is not at all rational. 
 So what do we have? The BP show is going on.,Our officials complained about Corexit,,which is the most toxic,line of dispersants.,But heck, they're still using it,,and they used the most toxic one, the 9527,,until they ran out of supplies.,Now they're on 9500.,9527 had 2-butoxyethanol in it,that causes internal bleeding.,We know that from the Exxon Valdez spill, by the way.,So what we're doing, we're putting compounds,with petroleum solvents onto a petroleum spill.,Does this make sense?,So this is the way it works.,And I want to show you this cute little thing that happens here.,It's a micelle.,Micelles form around the oil.,And what happens first,is the solvents break into the oil,,the lipid membrane,,they let the surfactants in there.,The surfactants -- which are like things,we use on fast food wrappers --,they grab around the droplets of oil,,and they make little, tiny droplets,with nice, little,surfactant edges to them.,The thing to remember about the micelles --,these little floating,globules of toxin --,is they are there to deliver.,They're like the FedEx guys.,And if you're a fish,,and you haven't gotten your glob in the morning,,you're going to get it in the afternoon,,because they've got your number. 
 So from a toxicology perspective,,this is really awful,because Corexit and the dispersed oil,are much more toxic together,than either alone.,And usually the exposure,is a combined exposure.,The dispersants -- as I was saying --,their job is to break down,the lipid membrane.,The solvents in them do that very efficiently.,So they break down,lipid membranes in our body,,starting with cells of the skin,,the cells of organs.,So it actually hastens,oil getting into the body,easily and readily.,Oil contains hundreds of hydrocarbon compounds,and other compounds,that are toxic to every organ in the body.,And so with the dispersants combined,,you have this very synergistic,combined toxicity.,Corexit also contains petroleum solvents,and many other toxic compounds.,And I'm part of a chat group,,which is a national group,of toxicologists and chemists,that are, you know, basically,turning cartwheels trying to figure out what's in this stuff,,and what is it doing and what are the interactions,of these chemicals, most of which we don't know,,and what are their byproducts,,which are usually more toxic than the parent compound.,So we did find that Corexit 9500,contains heavy metals, arsenic and chromium --,arsenic at high enough levels,to have cancer-causing effects. 
 So this is what we have to look at,,these, you know, ridiculous safety data sheets,,which have nothing on them much.,And now they were forced to release the ultimate list,of everything that's in Corexit.,And guess what,,tons of stuff is missing.,Derivatives, derivatives, these are whole big groups,of many, many compounds, these sorbitans.,And then you get down to the petroleum distillates,,which are the solvents,,hundreds of them.,They are not identified. And why?,Trade secrets again.,BP's running the show,,and the Nalco company, this is all they have to do.,So far these ingredients have not been released,,and toxicologists are actually going nuts,because we cannot predict with certainty,what the interactions,and toxic results are going to be. 
 But we do have quite a lot at risk,down there, as we all know,,the 33 wildlife refuges,,so much wildlife,and fish and diversity.,So we know from previous spills.,And then part of this is just,part of my bad dreams.,And I appreciate being able,to vent some of my,anguish upon you.,What we do know is that the corals are going to get hit hard.,And this is a study that was done,on the Australian coast,,the coast of Tasmania.,Corals are, you know, the home to,about a quarter of all marine species.,And with the Corexit,and the oil,,there's zero percent fertilization.,With oil alone, there's 98 percent fertilization.,So they're a very sensitive species,to this combo. 
 Here's another group.,I could see myself easily in the water column.,The plankton and the plankton eaters,,you know, these are the little herring fish,that go through the water column with their mouths open,,feeding indiscriminately,and just lapping up,this brown pudding of toxic stuff.,And we do know from other studies,that this is a highly toxic mixture.,See the oil and Corexit is causing death,at a much, much lower dose,than oil alone.,That's probably as far as what we do know,about toxic effects.,But my bad dreams go like this.,The piscivorous fish,,the cobia, grouper, amberjacks, those big fish,,also the tuna and sharks,,are going to hit by this.,And the gills are quite sensitive.,The respiratory system is very sensitive.,Think about it with,the Corexit hitting the membranes,,and it will clog up the gills,,and then these animals are going to be,getting something like what you call,chemical pneumonia,,trying to aspirate the compounds.,It also will cause internal bleeding,upon ingestion.,I'm very worried about the air-breathing mammals because I study them,,but also, the way their going to be exposed,is every time they come to the surface to take a breath,,they're going to inhale these volatile fumes.,And what does happen with that eventually,is pneumonia sets in,and liver, kidney, brain damage.,The Corexit,is transporting the oil,into every membrane,and every system of the body.,And you're having,a lot of different unpleasant effects,,but burns to the eyes and mouth,,skin ulcers, lesions.,And I think, personally,,that we have not begun to see,the impacts of this spill,on the wildlife of the Gulf. 
 We started hypothesizing:,what do we know?,what do with think would be a trophic cascade?,which means that somebody gets wiped out,,and then everything above,that's eating those guys will crash.,So our thought was --,this is a simple thinking process, but ...,obviously the plankton, the planktivores,,and that's about as far as we got.,And then it turns out we're not very good at figuring this stuff out.,This is what the Exxon Valdez scientists thought would happen,,this trophic cascade,where you lose the kelp and the herring,and other fishes and going up.,They thought that eventually the killer whale,would be at the top of this cascade.,And then here's what really happened,,much more complicated, much more specific.,Actually the kelp,and the barnacles that attach to the rock,were decimated by the combination,of Corexit and the oil.,They were replaced by invasive species,,which had less holding power to the rock.,Storms came along.,They ripped out of the rock.,And this was the entire food web for the sea ducks.,And as you know, we lost about 300,000 sea ducks,from the Exxon Valdez spill,,and they haven't come back. 
 So we are launching,an independent study.,And by independent, I do not mean alone;,I mean independent in the sense,of not tied to,the kind of crime-scene secrecy,that's going on in the Gulf now.,But we are actually going to be assessing toxic impacts,,but we need lots and lots of partners,to do this intelligently.,We have some of the partners lined up.,And Dave Gallo signed on.,Sylvia's in here.,And we hope that some of you will help us.,My question to you is: why shouldn't we know?,Don't we have the right to know?,Surely we have the right to learn,what loss we are going through in the Gulf.,And my wish would be --,for the gulf prize -- would be,that we have the truth.,Whatever it is, please let us have the truth.,And to get there,,we need to do the assessment. 
 So I appreciate being here. Thank you. 
 (Applause)Now, since this is TEDGlobal,,who can tell me what this is called in French?,I see you're all up on the history of hurdy-gurdy --,"vielle à roue.",And in Spanish, "zanfona.",And in Italian, "ghironda," okay?,Hurdy-gurdy, or wheel fiddle. 
 So, these are the different kinds and shapes of the hurdy-gurdy.,The hurdy-gurdy is the only musical instrument,that uses a crank to turn a wheel,to rub strings, like the bow of a violin,,to produce music.,It has three different kinds of strings.,The first string is the drone string,,which plays a continuous sound like the bagpipe.,The second string is a melody string,,which is played with a wooden keyboard tuned like a piano.,And the third string is pretty innovative.,It's also the only instrument,that uses this kind of technique.,It activates what's called the buzzing bridge, or the dog.,When I turn the crank and I apply pressure,,it makes a sound like a barking dog.,So all of this is pretty innovative,,if you consider,that the hurdy-gurdy appeared about a thousand years ago,and it took two people to play it;,one to turn the crank,,and another person -- yes -- to play the melody,by physically pulling up large wooden pegs.,Luckily, all of this changed a couple of centuries later.,So, one person could actually play,and almost -- this is pretty heavy --,carry the hurdy-gurdy. 
 The hurdy-gurdy has been used, historically, through the centuries,in mostly dance music,because of the uniqueness of the melody,combined with the acoustic boombox here.,And today, the hurdy-gurdy is used in all sorts of music --,traditional folk music,,dance, contemporary,and world music --,in the U.K., in France, in Spain,and in Italy.,And this kind of hurdy-gurdy takes anywhere from three to five years [to order and receive it].,It's made by specialized luthiers,,also in Europe.,And it's very difficult to tune. 
 So without further ado, would you like to hear it? 
 (Audience: Yes.) 
 Caroline Phillips: I didn't hear you. Would you like to hear it? (Audience: Yes!) 
 CP: Okay.,There I go.,I'd like to sing in Basque,,which is the language spoken in the Basque Country where I live,,in the region in France and Spain. 
 (Music) 
 [Basque] 
 (Music) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 This is a song that I wrote,based on traditional Basque rhythms.,And this is a song that has a kind of a Celtic feel. 
 (Music) 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
 (Applause)Hello. I would like to start my talk,with actually two questions, and the first one is:,How many people here actually eat pig meat?,Please raise your hand --,oh, that's a lot.,And how many people have actually seen,a live pig producing this meat?,In the last year? 
 In the Netherlands -- where I come from --,you actually never see a pig, which is really strange,,because, on a population of 16 million people,,we have 12 million pigs.,And well, of course, the Dutch can't eat all these pigs.,They eat about one-third, and the rest is exported,to all kinds of countries in Europe and the rest of the world.,A lot goes to the U.K., Germany. 
 And what I was curious about --,because historically, the whole pig would be used up until the last bit,so nothing would be wasted --,and I was curious to find out,if this was actually still the case.,And I spent about three years researching.,And I followed this one pig,with number "05049,",all the way up until the end,and to what products it's made of.,And in these years, I met all kinds people,like, for instance, farmers and butchers, which seems logical.,But I also met aluminum mold makers,,ammunition producers,and all kinds of people.,And what was striking to me,is that the farmers actually had no clue,what was made of their pigs,,but the consumers -- as in us --,had also no idea,of the pigs being in all these products. 
 So what I did is,,I took all this research,and I made it into a -- well, basically it's a product catalog of this one pig,,and it carries a duplicate of his ear tag,on the back.,And it consists of seven chapters --,the chapters are skin, bones, meat, internal organs,,blood, fat and miscellaneous.,(Laughter),In total,,they weigh 103.7 kilograms.,And to show you how often you actually,meet part of this pig in a regular day,,I want to show you some images of the book. 
 You probably start the day with a shower.,So, in soap, fatty acids,made from boiling pork bone fat,are used as a hardening agent,,but also for giving it a pearl-like effect.,Then if you look around you in the bathroom,,you see lots more products,like shampoo, conditioner,,anti-wrinkle cream, body lotion,,but also toothpaste.,Then, so, before breakfast,,you've already met the pig so many times.,Then, at breakfast, the pig that I followed,,the hairs off the pig or proteins from the hairs off the pig,were used as an improver of dough.,(Laughter),Well, that's what the producer says: it's "improving the dough,,of course.",In low-fat butter, or actually in many low-fat products,,when you take the fat out, you actually take the taste and the texture out.,So what they do is they put gelatin back in,,in order to retain the texture. 
 Well, when you're off to work, under the road or under the buildings that you see,,there might very well be cellular concrete,,which is a very light kind of concrete,that's actually got proteins from bones inside,and it's also fully reusable.,In the train brakes -- at least in the German train brakes --,there's this part of the brake,that's made of bone ash.,And in cheesecake and all kinds of desserts,,like chocolate mousse, tiramisu, vanilla pudding,,everything that's cooled in the supermarket,,there's gelatin to make it look good.,Fine bone china -- this is a real classic.,Of course, the bone in fine-bone china,gives it its translucency,and also its strength,,in order to make these really fine shapes,,like this deer. 
 In interior decorating, the pig's actually quite there.,It's used in paint for the texture,,but also for the glossiness.,In sandpaper, bone glue,is actually the glue between the sand and the paper.,And then in paintbrushes,,hairs are used because, apparently, they're very suitable for making paintbrushes,because of their hard-wearing nature. 
 I was not planning on showing you any meat,because, of course, half the book's meat,and you probably all know what meats they are.,But I didn't want you to miss out on this one,,because this, well, it's called "portion-controlled meat cuts.",And this is actually sold,in the frozen area of the supermarket.,And what it is -- it's actually steak.,So, this is sold as cow,,but what happens when you slaughter a cow --,at least in industrial factory farming --,they have all these little bits of steak left,that they can't actually sell as steak,,so what they do is they glue them all together,with fibrin from pig blood,into this really large sausage,,then freeze the sausage, cut it in little slices,and sell those as steak again.,And this also actually happens with tuna and scallops.,So, with the steak, you might drink a beer.,In the brewing process, there's lots of cloudy elements in the beer,,so to get rid of these cloudy elements,,what some companies do,is they pour the beer through a sort of gelatin sieve,in order to get rid of that cloudiness.,This actually also goes for wine as well as fruit juice. 
 There's actually a company in Greece,that produces these cigarettes,that actually contain hemoglobin from pigs in the filter.,And according to them,,this creates an artificial lung in the filter.,(Laughter),So, this is actually a healthier cigarette.,(Laughter),Injectable collagen -- or, since the '70s, collagen from pigs --,has been used for injecting into wrinkles.,And the reason for this is that pigs are actually quite close to human beings,,so the collagen is as well.,Well, this must be the strangest thing I found.,This is a bullet coming from,a very large ammunition company in the United States. 
 And while I was making the book,,I contacted all the producers of products,because I wanted them to send me the real samples,and the real specimens.,So I sent this company an email,saying, "Hello. I'm Christien. I'm doing this research.,And can you send me a bullet?",(Laughter),And well, I didn't expect them to even answer my email.,But they answered,and they said, "Why, thank you for your email. What an interesting story.,Are you in anyway related to the Dutch government?",I thought that was really weird,,as if the Dutch government sends emails to anyone. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, the most beautiful thing I found --,at least what I think is the most beautiful -- in the book, is this heart valve.,It's actually a very low-tech,and very high-tech product at the same time.,The low-tech bit is that it's literally a pig's heart valve,mounted in the high-tech bit,,which is a memory metal casing.,And what happens is this can be implanted into a human heart,without open heart surgery.,And once it's in the right spot,,they remove the outer shell,,and the heart valve, well, it gets this shape,and at that moment it starts beating, instantly.,It's really a sort of magical moment.,So this is actually a Dutch company,,so I called them up, and I asked,,"Can I borrow a heart valve from you?",And the makers of this thing were really enthusiastic.,So they were like, "Okay, we'll put it in a jar for you with formalin,,and you can borrow it.",Great -- and then I didn't hear from them for weeks,,so I called,,and I asked, "What's going on with the heart valve?",And they said, "Well the director of the company,decided not to let you borrow this heart valve,,because want his product,to be associated with pigs." 
 (Laughter) 
 Well, the last product from the book that I'm showing you is renewable energy --,actually, to show that my first question,,if pigs are still used up until the last bit, was still true.,Well it is, because everything that can't be used for anything else,is made into a fuel,that can be used as renewable energy source. 
 In total, I found 185 products.,And what they showed me,is that, well, firstly,,it's at least to say odd,that we don't treat these pigs,as absolute kings and queens.,And the second, is that we actually don't have a clue,of what all these products that surround us are made of. 
 And you might think I'm very fond of pigs,,but actually -- well, I am a little bit --,but I'm more fond,of raw materials in general.,And I think that, in order to take better care,of what's behind our products --,so, the livestock, the crops, the plants,,the non-renewable materials,,but also the people that produce these products --,the first step would actually be to know that they are there. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)We've got a real problem with math education right now.,Basically, no one's very happy.,Those learning it,think it's disconnected,,uninteresting and hard.,Those trying to employ them,think they don't know enough.,Governments realize that it's a big deal for our economies,,but don't know how to fix it.,And teachers are also frustrated.,Yet math is more important to the world,than at any point in human history.,So at one end we've got falling interest,in education in math,,and at the other end we've got a more mathematical world,,a more quantitative world than we ever have had. 
 So what's the problem, why has this chasm opened up,,and what can we do to fix it?,Well actually, I think the answer,is staring us right in the face:,Use computers.,I believe,that correctly using computers,is the silver bullet,for making math education work.,So to explain that,,let me first talk a bit about what math looks like in the real world,and what it looks like in education.,See, in the real world,math isn't necessarily done by mathematicians.,It's done by geologists,,engineers, biologists,,all sorts of different people --,modeling and simulation.,It's actually very popular.,But in education it looks very different --,dumbed-down problems, lots of calculating,,mostly by hand.,Lots of things that seem simple,and not difficult like in the real world,,except if you're learning it.,And another thing about math:,math sometimes looks like math --,like in this example here --,and sometimes it doesn't --,like "Am I drunk?",And then you get an answer that's quantitative in the modern world.,You wouldn't have expected that a few years back.,But now you can find out all about --,unfortunately, my weight is a little higher than that, but --,all about what happens. 
 So let's zoom out a bit and ask,,why are we teaching people math?,What's the point of teaching people math?,And in particular, why are we teaching them math in general?,Why is it such an important part of education,as a sort of compulsory subject?,Well, I think there are about three reasons:,technical jobs,so critical to the development of our economies,,what I call "everyday living" --,to function in the world today,,you've got to be pretty quantitative,,much more so than a few years ago:,figure out your mortgages,,being skeptical of government statistics, those kinds of things --,and thirdly, what I would call something like,logical mind training, logical thinking.,Over the years,we've put so much in society,into being able to process and think logically. It's part of human society.,It's very important to learn that,math is a great way to do that. 
 So let's ask another question.,What is math?,What do we mean when we say we're doing math,,or educating people to do math?,Well, I think it's about four steps, roughly speaking,,starting with posing the right question.,What is it that we want to ask? What is it we're trying to find out here?,And this is the thing most screwed up in the outside world,,beyond virtually any other part of doing math.,People ask the wrong question,,and surprisingly enough, they get the wrong answer,,for that reason, if not for others.,So the next thing is take that problem,and turn it from a real world problem,into a math problem.,That's stage two.,Once you've done that, then there's the computation step.,Turn it from that into some answer,in a mathematical form.,And of course, math is very powerful at doing that.,And then finally, turn it back to the real world.,Did it answer the question?,And also verify it -- crucial step.,Now here's the crazy thing right now.,In math education,,we're spending about perhaps 80 percent of the time,teaching people to do step three by hand.,Yet, that's the one step computers can do,better than any human after years of practice.,Instead, we ought to be using computers,to do step three,and using the students to spend much more effort,on learning how to do steps one, two and four --,conceptualizing problems, applying them,,getting the teacher to run them through how to do that. 
 See, crucial point here:,math is not equal to calculating.,Math is a much broader subject than calculating.,Now it's understandable that this has all got intertwined,over hundreds of years.,There was only one way to do calculating and that was by hand.,But in the last few decades,that has totally changed.,We've had the biggest transformation of any ancient subject,that I could ever imagine with computers.,Calculating was typically the limiting step,,and now often it isn't.,So I think in terms of the fact that math,has been liberated from calculating.,But that math liberation didn't get into education yet.,See, I think of calculating, in a sense,,as the machinery of math.,It's the chore.,It's the thing you'd like to avoid if you can, like to get a machine to do.,It's a means to an end, not an end in itself,,and automation allows us,to have that machinery.,Computers allow us to do that --,and this is not a small problem by any means.,I estimated that, just today, across the world,,we spent about 106 average world lifetimes,teaching people how to calculate by hand.,That's an amazing amount of human endeavor.,So we better be damn sure --,and by the way, they didn't even have fun doing it, most of them --,so we better be damn sure,that we know why we're doing that,and it has a real purpose. 
 I think we should be assuming computers,for doing the calculating,and only doing hand calculations where it really makes sense to teach people that.,And I think there are some cases.,For example: mental arithmetic.,I still do a lot of that, mainly for estimating.,People say, "Is such and such true?",And I'll say, "Hmm, not sure." I'll think about it roughly.,It's still quicker to do that and more practical.,So I think practicality is one case,where it's worth teaching people by hand.,And then there are certain conceptual things,that can also benefit from hand calculating,,but I think they're relatively small in number.,One thing I often ask about,is ancient Greek and how this relates.,See, the thing we're doing right now,is we're forcing people to learn mathematics.,It's a major subject.,I'm not for one minute suggesting that, if people are interested in hand calculating,or in following their own interests,in any subject however bizarre --,they should do that.,That's absolutely the right thing,,for people to follow their self-interest.,I was somewhat interested in ancient Greek,,but I don't think that we should force the entire population,to learn a subject like ancient Greek.,I don't think it's warranted.,So I have this distinction between what we're making people do,and the subject that's sort of mainstream,and the subject that, in a sense, people might follow with their own interest,and perhaps even be spiked into doing that. 
 So what are the issues people bring up with this?,Well one of them is, they say, you need to get the basics first.,You shouldn't use the machine,until you get the basics of the subject.,So my usual question is, what do you mean by "basics?",Basics of what?,Are the basics of driving a car,learning how to service it, or design it for that matter?,Are the basics of writing learning how to sharpen a quill?,I don't think so.,I think you need to separate the basics of what you're trying to do,from how it gets done,and the machinery of how it gets done,and automation allows you to make that separation.,A hundred years ago, it's certainly true that to drive a car,you kind of needed to know a lot about the mechanics of the car,and how the ignition timing worked and all sorts of things.,But automation in cars,allowed that to separate,,so driving is now a quite separate subject, so to speak,,from engineering of the car,or learning how to service it.,So automation allows this separation,and also allows -- in the case of driving,,and I believe also in the future case of maths --,a democratized way of doing that.,It can be spread across a much larger number of people,who can really work with that. 
 So there's another thing that comes up with basics.,People confuse, in my view,,the order of the invention of the tools,with the order in which they should use them for teaching.,So just because paper was invented before computers,,it doesn't necessarily mean you get more to the basics of the subject,by using paper instead of a computer,to teach mathematics.,My daughter gave me a rather nice anecdote on this.,She enjoys making what she calls "paper laptops.",(Laughter),So I asked her one day, "You know, when I was your age,,I didn't make these.,Why do you think that was?",And after a second or two, carefully reflecting,,she said, "No paper?",(Laughter),If you were born after computers and paper,,it doesn't really matter which order you're taught with them in,,you just want to have the best tool. 
 So another one that comes up is "Computers dumb math down.",That somehow, if you use a computer,,it's all mindless button-pushing,,but if you do it by hand,,it's all intellectual.,This one kind of annoys me, I must say.,Do we really believe,that the math that most people are doing in school,practically today,is more than applying procedures,to problems they don't really understand, for reasons they don't get?,I don't think so.,And what's worse, what they're learning there isn't even practically useful anymore.,Might have been 50 years ago, but it isn't anymore.,When they're out of education, they do it on a computer.,Just to be clear, I think computers can really help with this problem,,actually make it more conceptual.,Now, of course, like any great tool,,they can be used completely mindlessly,,like turning everything into a multimedia show,,like the example I was shown of solving an equation by hand,,where the computer was the teacher --,show the student how to manipulate and solve it by hand.,This is just nuts.,Why are we using computers to show a student how to solve a problem by hand,that the computer should be doing anyway?,All backwards. 
 Let me show you,that you can also make problems harder to calculate.,See, normally in school,,you do things like solve quadratic equations.,But you see, when you're using a computer,,you can just substitute.,You can make it a quartic equation. Make it kind of harder, calculating-wise.,Same principles applied --,calculations, harder.,And problems in the real world,look nutty and horrible like this.,They've got hair all over them.,They're not just simple, dumbed-down things that we see in school math.,And think of the outside world.,Do we really believe that engineering and biology,and all of these other things,that have so benefited from computers and maths,have somehow conceptually gotten reduced by using computers?,I don't think so -- quite the opposite.,So the problem we've really got in math education,is not that computers might dumb it down,,but that we have dumbed-down problems right now.,Well, another issue people bring up,is somehow that hand calculating procedures,teach understanding.,So if you go through lots of examples,,you can get the answer,,you can understand how the basics of the system work better.,I think there is one thing that I think very valid here,,which is that I think understanding procedures and processes is important.,But there's a fantastic way to do that in the modern world.,It's called programming. 
 Programming is how most procedures and processes,get written down these days,,and it's also a great way,to engage students much more,and to check they really understand.,If you really want to check you understand math,then write a program to do it.,So programming is the way I think we should be doing that.,So to be clear, what I really am suggesting here,is we have a unique opportunity,to make maths both more practical,and more conceptual, simultaneously.,I can't think of any other subject where that's recently been possible.,It's usually some kind of choice,between the vocational and the intellectual.,But I think we can do both at the same time here.,And we open up so many more possibilities.,You can do so many more problems.,What I really think we gain from this,is students getting intuition and experience,in far greater quantities than they've ever got before.,And experience of harder problems --,being able to play with the math, interact with it,,feel it.,We want people who can feel the math instinctively.,That's what computers allow us to do. 
 Another thing it allows us to do is reorder the curriculum.,Traditionally it's been by how difficult it is to calculate,,but now we can reorder it,by how difficult it is to understand the concepts,,however hard the calculating.,So calculus has traditionally been taught very late.,Why is this?,Well, it's damn hard doing the calculations, that's the problem.,But actually many of the concepts,are amenable to a much younger age group.,This was an example I built for my daughter.,And very, very simple.,We were talking about what happens,when you increase the number of sides of a polygon,to a very large number.,And of course, it turns into a circle.,And by the way, she was also very insistent,on being able to change the color,,an important feature for this demonstration.,You can see that this is a very early step,into limits and differential calculus,and what happens when you take things to an extreme --,and very small sides and a very large number of sides.,Very simple example.,That's a view of the world,that we don't usually give people for many, many years after this.,And yet, that's a really important practical view of the world.,So one of the roadblocks we have,in moving this agenda forward,is exams.,In the end, if we test everyone by hand in exams,,it's kind of hard to get the curricula changed,to a point where they can use computers,during the semesters. 
 And one of the reasons it's so important --,so it's very important to get computers in exams.,And then we can ask questions, real questions,,questions like, what's the best life insurance policy to get? --,real questions that people have in their everyday lives.,And you see, this isn't some dumbed-down model here.,This is an actual model where we can be asked to optimize what happens.,How many years of protection do I need?,What does that do to the payments,and to the interest rates and so forth?,Now I'm not for one minute suggesting it's the only kind of question,that should be asked in exams,,but I think it's a very important type,that right now just gets completely ignored,and is critical for people's real understanding. 
 So I believe [there is] critical reform,we have to do in computer-based math.,We have got to make sure,that we can move our economies forward,,and also our societies,,based on the idea that people can really feel mathematics.,This isn't some optional extra.,And the country that does this first,will, in my view, leapfrog others,in achieving a new economy even,,an improved economy,,an improved outlook.,In fact, I even talk about us moving,from what we often call now the "knowledge economy",to what we might call a "computational knowledge economy,",where high-level math is integral to what everyone does,in the way that knowledge currently is.,We can engage so many more students with this,,and they can have a better time doing it.,And let's understand:,this is not an incremental sort of change.,We're trying to cross the chasm here,between school math and the real-world math.,And you know if you walk across a chasm,,you end up making it worse than if you didn't start at all --,bigger disaster.,No, what I'm suggesting,is that we should leap off,,we should increase our velocity,so it's high,,and we should leap off one side and go the other --,of course, having calculated our differential equation very carefully. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I want to see,a completely renewed, changed math curriculum,built from the ground up,,based on computers being there,,computers that are now ubiquitous almost.,Calculating machines are everywhere,and will be completely everywhere in a small number of years.,Now I'm not even sure if we should brand the subject as math,,but what I am sure is,it's the mainstream subject of the future.,Let's go for it,,and while we're about it,,let's have a bit of fun,,for us, for the students and for TED here. 
 Thanks. 
 (Applause)It feels like we're all suffering,from information overload or data glut.,And the good news is there might be an easy solution to that,,and that's using our eyes more.,So, visualizing information, so that we can see,the patterns and connections that matter,and then designing that information so it makes more sense,,or it tells a story,,or allows us to focus only on the information that's important.,Failing that, visualized information can just look really cool. 
 So, let's see.,This is the $Billion Dollar o-Gram,,and this image arose,out of frustration I had,with the reporting of billion-dollar amounts in the press.,That is, they're meaningless without context:,500 billion for this pipeline,,20 billion for this war.,It doesn't make any sense, so the only way to understand it,is visually and relatively.,So I scraped a load of reported figures,from various news outlets,and then scaled the boxes according to those amounts.,And the colors here represent the motivation behind the money.,So purple is "fighting,",and red is "giving money away," and green is "profiteering.",And what you can see straight away,is you start to have a different relationship to the numbers.,You can literally see them.,But more importantly, you start to see,patterns and connections between numbers,that would otherwise be scattered across multiple news reports. 
 Let me point out some that I really like.,This is OPEC's revenue, this green box here --,780 billion a year.,And this little pixel in the corner -- three billion --,that's their climate change fund.,Americans, incredibly generous people --,over 300 billion a year, donated to charity every year,,compared with the amount of foreign aid,given by the top 17 industrialized nations,at 120 billion.,Then of course,,the Iraq War, predicted to cost just 60 billion,back in 2003.,And it mushroomed slightly. Afghanistan and Iraq mushroomed now,to 3,000 billion.,So now it's great,because now we have this texture, and we can add numbers to it as well.,So we could say, well, a new figure comes out ... let's see African debt.,How much of this diagram do you think might be taken up,by the debt that Africa owes to the West?,Let's take a look.,So there it is:,227 billion is what Africa owes.,And the recent financial crisis,,how much of this diagram might that figure take up?,What has that cost the world? Let's take a look at that.,Dooosh -- Which I think is the appropriate sound effect,for that much money:,11,900 billion.,So, by visualizing this information,,we turned it into a landscape,that you can explore with your eyes,,a kind of map really, a sort of information map.,And when you're lost in information,,an information map is kind of useful. 
 So I want to show you another landscape now.,We need to imagine what a landscape,of the world's fears might look like.,Let's take a look.,This is Mountains Out of Molehills,,a timeline of global media panic.,(Laughter),So, I'll label this for you in a second.,But the height here, I want to point out,,is the intensity of certain fears,as reported in the media.,Let me point them out.,So this, swine flu -- pink.,Bird flu.,SARS -- brownish here. Remember that one?,The millennium bug,,terrible disaster.,These little green peaks,are asteroid collisions.,(Laughter),And in summer, here, killer wasps. 
 (Laughter) 
 So these are what our fears look like,over time in our media.,But what I love -- and I'm a journalist --,and what I love is finding hidden patterns; I love being a data detective.,And there's a very interesting and odd pattern hidden in this data,that you can only see when you visualize it.,Let me highlight it for you.,See this line, this is a landscape for violent video games.,As you can see, there's a kind of odd, regular pattern in the data,,twin peaks every year.,If we look closer, we see those peaks occur,at the same month every year.,Why?,Well, November, Christmas video games come out,,and there may well be an upsurge in the concern about their content.,But April isn't a particularly massive month,for video games.,Why April?,Well, in April 1999 was the Columbine shooting,,and since then, that fear,has been remembered by the media,and echoes through the group mind gradually through the year.,You have retrospectives, anniversaries,,court cases, even copy-cat shootings,,all pushing that fear into the agenda.,And there's another pattern here as well. Can you spot it?,See that gap there? There's a gap,,and it affects all the other stories.,Why is there a gap there?,You see where it starts? September 2001,,when we had something very real,to be scared about. 
 So, I've been working as a data journalist for about a year,,and I keep hearing a phrase,all the time, which is this:,"Data is the new oil.",Data is the kind of ubiquitous resource,that we can shape to provide new innovations and new insights,,and it's all around us, and it can be mined very easily.,It's not a particularly great metaphor in these times,,especially if you live around the Gulf of Mexico,,but I would, perhaps, adapt this metaphor slightly,,and I would say that data is the new soil.,Because for me, it feels like a fertile, creative medium.,Over the years, online,,we've laid down,a huge amount of information and data,,and we irrigate it with networks and connectivity,,and it's been worked and tilled by unpaid workers and governments.,And, all right, I'm kind of milking the metaphor a little bit.,But it's a really fertile medium,,and it feels like visualizations, infographics, data visualizations,,they feel like flowers blooming from this medium.,But if you look at it directly,,it's just a lot of numbers and disconnected facts.,But if you start working with it and playing with it in a certain way,,interesting things can appear and different patterns can be revealed. 
 Let me show you this.,Can you guess what this data set is?,What rises twice a year,,once in Easter,and then two weeks before Christmas,,has a mini peak every Monday,,and then flattens out over the summer?,I'll take answers.,(Audience: Chocolate.) David McCandless: Chocolate.,You might want to get some chocolate in.,Any other guesses?,(Audience: Shopping.) DM: Shopping.,Yeah, retail therapy might help.,(Audience: Sick leave.),DM: Sick leave. Yeah, you'll definitely want to take some time off.,Shall we see? 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 So, the information guru Lee Byron and myself,,we scraped 10,000 status Facebook updates,for the phrase "break-up" and "broken-up",and this is the pattern we found --,people clearing out for Spring Break,,(Laughter),coming out of very bad weekends on a Monday,,being single over the summer,,and then the lowest day of the year, of course: Christmas Day.,Who would do that?,So there's a titanic amount of data out there now,,unprecedented.,But if you ask the right kind of question,,or you work it in the right kind of way,,interesting things can emerge. 
 So information is beautiful. Data is beautiful.,I wonder if I could make my life beautiful.,And here's my visual C.V.,I'm not quite sure I've succeeded.,Pretty blocky, the colors aren't that great.,But I wanted to convey something to you.,I started as a programmer,,and then I worked as a writer for many years, about 20 years,,in print, online and then in advertising,,and only recently have I started designing.,And I've never been to design school.,I've never studied art or anything.,I just kind of learned through doing.,And when I started designing,,I discovered an odd thing about myself.,I already knew how to design,,but it wasn't like I was amazingly brilliant at it,,but more like I was sensitive,to the ideas of grids and space,and alignment and typography.,It's almost like being exposed,to all this media over the years,had instilled a kind of dormant design literacy in me.,And I don't feel like I'm unique. 
 I feel that everyday, all of us now,are being blasted by information design.,It's being poured into our eyes through the Web,,and we're all visualizers now;,we're all demanding a visual aspect,to our information.,There's something almost quite magical about visual information.,It's effortless, it literally pours in.,And if you're navigating a dense information jungle,,coming across a beautiful graphic,or a lovely data visualization,,it's a relief, it's like coming across a clearing in the jungle.,I was curious about this, so it led me,to the work of a Danish physicist,called Tor Norretranders,,and he converted the bandwidth of the senses into computer terms. 
 So here we go. This is your senses,,pouring into your senses every second.,Your sense of sight is the fastest.,It has the same bandwidth as a computer network.,Then you have touch, which is about the speed of a USB key.,And then you have hearing and smell,,which has the throughput of a hard disk.,And then you have poor old taste,,which is like barely the throughput of a pocket calculator.,And that little square in the corner, a naught .7 percent,,that's the amount we're actually aware of.,So a lot of your vision --,the bulk of it is visual, and it's pouring in.,It's unconscious.,The eye is exquisitely sensitive,to patterns in variations in color, shape and pattern.,It loves them, and it calls them beautiful.,It's the language of the eye.,If you combine the language of the eye with the language of the mind,,which is about words and numbers and concepts,,you start speaking two languages simultaneously,,each enhancing the other.,So, you have the eye, and then you drop in the concepts.,And that whole thing -- it's two languages,both working at the same time. 
 So we can use this new kind of language, if you like,,to alter our perspective or change our views.,Let me ask you a simple question,with a really simple answer:,Who has the biggest military budget?,It's got to be America, right?,Massive. 609 billion in 2008 --,607, rather.,So massive, in fact, that it can contain,all the other military budgets in the world inside itself.,Gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble, gobble.,Now, you can see Africa's total debt there,and the U.K. budget deficit for reference.,So that might well chime,with your view that America,is a sort of warmongering military machine,,out to overpower the world,with its huge industrial-military complex.,But is it true that America has the biggest military budget?,Because America is an incredibly rich country.,In fact, it's so massively rich,that it can contain the four other,top industrialized nations' economies,inside itself, it's so vastly rich.,So its military budget is bound to be enormous.,So, to be fair and to alter our perspective,,we have to bring in another data set,,and that data set is GDP, or the country's earnings.,Who has the biggest budget as a proportion of GDP?,Let's have a look.,That changes the picture considerably.,Other countries pop into view that you, perhaps, weren't considering,,and American drops into eighth. 
 Now you can also do this with soldiers.,Who has the most soldiers? It's got to be China.,Of course, 2.1 million.,Again, chiming with your view,that China has a militarized regime,ready to, you know, mobilize its enormous forces.,But of course, China has an enormous population.,So if we do the same,,we see a radically different picture.,China drops to 124th.,It actually has a tiny army,when you take other data into consideration.,So, absolute figures, like the military budget,,in a connected world,,don't give you the whole picture.,They're not as true as they could be. 
 We need relative figures that are connected to other data,so that we can see a fuller picture,,and then that can lead to us changing our perspective.,As Hans Rosling, the master,,my master, said,,"Let the dataset change your mindset.",And if it can do that, maybe it can also change your behavior. 
 Take a look at this one.,I'm a bit of a health nut.,I love taking supplements and being fit,,but I can never understand what's going on in terms of evidence.,There's always conflicting evidence.,Should I take vitamin C? Should I be taking wheatgrass?,This is a visualization of all the evidence,for nutritional supplements.,This kind of diagram is called a balloon race.,So the higher up the image,,the more evidence there is for each supplement.,And the bubbles correspond to popularity as regards to Google hits.,So you can immediately apprehend,the relationship between efficacy and popularity,,but you can also, if you grade the evidence,,do a "worth it" line.,So supplements above this line are worth investigating,,but only for the conditions listed below,,and then the supplements below the line,are perhaps not worth investigating. 
 Now this image constitutes a huge amount of work.,We scraped like 1,000 studies from PubMed,,the biomedical database,,and we compiled them and graded them all.,And it was incredibly frustrating for me,because I had a book of 250 visualizations to do for my book,,and I spent a month doing this,,and I only filled two pages.,But what it points to,is that visualizing information like this,is a form of knowledge compression.,It's a way of squeezing an enormous amount,of information and understanding,into a small space.,And once you've curated that data, and once you've cleaned that data,,and once it's there,,you can do cool stuff like this. 
 So I converted this into an interactive app,,so I can now generate this application online --,this is the visualization online --,and I can say, "Yeah, brilliant.",So it spawns itself.,And then I can say, "Well, just show me the stuff,that affects heart health.",So let's filter that out.,So heart is filtered out, so I can see if I'm curious about that.,I think, "No, no. I don't want to take any synthetics,,I just want to see plants and --,just show me herbs and plants. I've got all the natural ingredients.",Now this app is spawning itself,from the data.,The data is all stored in a Google Doc,,and it's literally generating itself from that data.,So the data is now alive; this is a living image,,and I can update it in a second.,New evidence comes out. I just change a row on a spreadsheet.,Doosh! Again, the image recreates itself.,So it's cool.,It's kind of living. 
 But it can go beyond data,,and it can go beyond numbers.,I like to apply information visualization,to ideas and concepts.,This is a visualization,of the political spectrum,,an attempt for me to try,and understand how it works,and how the ideas percolate down,from government into society and culture,,into families, into individuals, into their beliefs,and back around again in a cycle.,What I love about this image,is it's made up of concepts,,it explores our worldviews,and it helps us -- it helps me anyway --,to see what others think,,to see where they're coming from.,And it feels just incredibly cool to do that. 
 What was most exciting for me,designing this,was that, when I was designing this image,,I desperately wanted this side, the left side,,to be better than the right side --,being a journalist, a Left-leaning person --,but I couldn't, because I would have created,a lopsided, biased diagram.,So, in order to really create a full image,,I had to honor the perspectives on the right-hand side,and at the same time, uncomfortably recognize,how many of those qualities were actually in me,,which was very, very annoying and uncomfortable.,(Laughter),But not too uncomfortable,,because there's something unthreatening,about seeing a political perspective,,versus being told or forced to listen to one.,You're capable of holding conflicting viewpoints,joyously when you can see them.,It's even fun to engage with them,because it's visual.,So that's what's exciting to me,,seeing how data can change my perspective,and change my mind midstream --,beautiful, lovely data. 
 So, just to wrap up,,I wanted to say,that it feels to me that design is about solving problems,and providing elegant solutions,,and information design is about,solving information problems.,It feels like we have a lot of information problems,in our society at the moment,,from the overload and the saturation,to the breakdown of trust and reliability,and runaway skepticism and lack of transparency,,or even just interestingness.,I mean, I find information just too interesting.,It has a magnetic quality that draws me in. 
 So, visualizing information,can give us a very quick solution to those kinds of problems.,Even when the information is terrible,,the visual can be quite beautiful.,Often we can get clarity,or the answer to a simple question very quickly,,like this one,,the recent Icelandic volcano.,Which was emitting the most CO2?,Was it the planes or the volcano,,the grounded planes or the volcano?,So we can have a look.,We look at the data and we see:,Yep, the volcano emitted 150,000 tons;,the grounded planes would have emitted,345,000 if they were in the sky.,So essentially, we had our first carbon-neutral volcano. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 And that is beautiful. Thank you. 
 (Applause)So, I'd like to spend a few minutes with you folks today,imagining what our planet might look like in a thousand years.,But before I do that,,I need to talk to you about synthetic materials like plastics,,which require huge amounts of energy to create,and, because of their disposal issues,,are slowly poisoning our planet.,I also want to tell you and share with you,how my team and I,have been using mushrooms over the last three years.,Not like that. (Laughter),We're using mushrooms to create an entirely new class of materials,,which perform a lot like plastics during their use,,but are made from crop waste,and are totally compostable at the end of their lives. 
 (Cheering) 
 But first,,I need to talk to you about what I consider one of the most egregious offenders,in the disposable plastics category.,This is a material you all know is Styrofoam,,but I like to think of it as toxic white stuff.,In a single cubic foot of this material --,about what would come around your computer or large television --,you have the same energy content,of about a liter and a half of petrol.,Yet, after just a few weeks of use,,you'll throw this material in the trash.,And this isn't just found in packaging.,20 billion dollars of this material is produced every year,,in everything from building materials to surfboards,to coffee cups to table tops.,And that's not the only place it's found.,The EPA estimates, in the United States,,by volume, this material occupies 25 percent of our landfills.,Even worse is when it finds its way into our natural environment --,on the side of the road or next to a river.,If it's not picked up by a human, like me and you,,it'll stay there for thousands and thousands of years.,Perhaps even worse,is when it finds its way into our oceans, like in the great plastic gyre,,where these materials are being mechanically broken,into smaller and smaller bits,,but they're not really going away.,They're not biologically compatible.,They're basically fouling up,Earth's respiratory and circulatory systems.,And because these materials are so prolific,,because they're found in so many places,,there's one other place you'll find this material, styrene,,which is made from benzene, a known carcinogen.,You'll find it inside of you. 
 So, for all these reasons,,I think we need better materials,,and there are three key principles we can use to guide these materials.,The first is feedstocks.,Today, we use a single feedstock, petroleum,,to heat our homes, power our cars,and make most of the materials you see around you.,We recognize this is a finite resource,,and it's simply crazy to do this, to put a liter and a half of petrol in the trash,every time you get a package.,Second of all, we should really strive to use far less energy,in creating these materials.,I say far less, because 10 percent isn't going to cut it.,We should be talking about half, a quarter,,one-tenth the energy content.,And lastly, and I think perhaps most importantly,,we should be creating materials,that fit into what I call nature's recycling system.,This recycling system has been in place for the last billion years.,I fit into it, you fit into it,,and a hundred years tops, my body can return to the Earth with no preprocessing.,Yet that packaging I got in the mail yesterday,is going to last for thousands of years.,This is crazy. 
 But nature provides us with a really good model here.,When a tree's done using its leaves --,its solar collectors, these amazing molecular photon capturing devices --,at the end of a season,,it doesn't pack them up, take them to the leaf reprocessing center,and have them melted down to form new leaves.,It just drops them, the shortest distance possible,,to the forest floor,,where they're actually upcycled into next year's topsoil.,And this gets us back to the mushrooms.,Because in nature,,mushrooms are the recycling system.,And what we've discovered,is, by using a part of the mushroom you've probably never seen --,analogous to its root structure; it's called mycelium --,we can actually grow materials,with many of the same properties of conventional synthetics. 
 Now, mycelium is an amazing material,,because it's a self-assembling material.,It actually takes things we would consider waste --,things like seed husks or woody biomass --,and can transform them into a chitinous polymer,,which you can form into almost any shape.,In our process,,we basically use it as a glue.,And by using mycelium as a glue,,you can mold things just like you do in the plastic industry,,and you can create materials with many different properties,,materials that are insulating, fire-resistant,,moisture-resistant, vapor-resistant --,materials that can absorb impacts, that can absorb acoustical impacts.,But these materials are grown from agricultural byproducts,,not petroleum.,And because they're made of natural materials,,they are 100 percent compostable,in you own backyard. 
 So I'd like to share with you the four basic steps,required to make these materials.,The first is selecting a feedstock,,preferably something that's regional, that's in your area, right --,local manufacturing.,The next is actually taking this feedstock and putting in a tool,,physically filling an enclosure, a mold,,in whatever shape you want to get.,Then you actually grow the mycelium through these particles,,and that's where the magic happens,,because the organism is doing the work in this process,,not the equipment.,The final step is, of course, the product,,whether it's a packaging material, a table top, or building block.,Our vision is local manufacturing,,like the local food movement, for production.,So we've created formulations for all around the world,using regional byproducts.,If you're in China, you might use a rice husk,or a cottonseed hull.,If you're in Northern Europe or North America,,you can use things like buckwheat husks or oat hulls.,We then process these husks with some basic equipment. 
 And I want to share with you a quick video from our facility,that gives you a sense of how this looks at scale.,So what you're seeing here is actually cotton hulls from Texas, in this case.,It's a waste product.,And what they're doing in our equipment,is going through a continuous system,,which cleans, cooks, cools,and pasteurizes these materials,,while also continuously inoculating them with our mycelium.,This gives us a continuous stream of material,that we can put into almost any shape,,though today we're making corner blocks.,And it's when this lid goes on the part,,that the magic really starts.,Because the manufacturing process is our organism.,It'll actually begin to digest these wastes,and, over the next five days,,assemble them into biocomposites.,Our entire facility,is comprised of thousands and thousands and thousands of these tools,sitting indoors in the dark, quietly self-assembling materials --,and everything from building materials,to, in this case,,a packaging corner block. 
 So I've said a number of times that we grow materials.,And it's kind of hard to picture how that happens.,So my team has taken five days-worth of growth,,a typical growth cycle for us,,and condensed it into a 15-second time lapse.,And I want you to really watch closely,these little white dots on the screen,,because, over the five-day period,,what they do is extend out and through this material,,using the energy that's contained in these seed husks,to build this chitinous polymer matrix.,This matrix self-assembles,,growing through and around the particles,,making millions and millions of tiny fibers.,And what parts of the seed husk we don't digest,,actually become part of the final, physical composite.,So in front of your eyes, this part just self-assembled.,It actually takes a little longer. It takes five days.,But it's much faster than conventional farming. 
 The last step, of course, is application.,In this case, we've grown a corner block.,A major Fortune 500 furniture maker,uses these corner blocks to protect their tables in shipment.,They used to use a plastic packaging buffer,,but we were able to give them the exact same physical performance,with our grown material.,Best of all, when it gets to the customer,,it's not trash.,They can actually put this in their natural ecosystem without any processing,,and it's going to improve the local soil. 
 So, why mycelium?,The first reason is local open feedstocks.,You want to be able to do this anywhere in the world,and not worry about peak rice hull or peak cottonseed hulls,,because you have multiple choices.,The next is self-assembly,,because the organism is actually doing most of the work in this process.,You don't need a lot of equipment to set up a production facility.,So you can have lots of small facilities,spread all across the world.,Biological yield is really important.,And because 100 percent of what we put in the tool become the final product,,even the parts that aren't digested,become part of the structure,,we're getting incredible yield rates. 
 Natural polymers, well ... I think that's what's most important,,because these polymers have been tried and tested,in our ecosystem for the last billion years,,in everything from mushrooms to crustaceans.,They're not going to clog up Earth's ecosystems. They work great.,And while, today,,we can practically guarantee that yesterday's packaging,is going to be here in 10,000 years,,what I want to guarantee,is that in 10,000 years,,our descendants, our children's children,,will be living happily and in harmony,with a healthy Earth.,And I think that can be some really good news. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I grew up on a small farm in Missouri.,We lived on less than a dollar a day,for about 15 years.,I got a scholarship, went to university,,studied international agriculture, studied anthropology,,and decided I was going to give back.,I was going to work with small farmers.,I was going to help alleviate poverty.,I was going to work on international development,,and then I took a turn,and ended up here.,Now, if you get a Ph.D., and you decide not to teach,,you don't always end up in a place like this.,It's a choice. You might end up driving a taxicab.,You could be in New York.,What I found was,,I started working with refugees and famine victims --,small farmers, all, or nearly all --,who had been dispossessed and displaced.,Now, what I'd been trained to do,was methodological research on such people.,So I did it: I found out how many women,had been raped en route to these camps.,I found out how many people had been put in jail,,how many family members had been killed.,I assessed how long they were going to stay,and how much it would take to feed them.,And I got really good at predicting,how many body bags you would need,for the people who were going to die in these camps. 
 Now this is God's work, but it's not my work.,It's not the work I set out to do.,So I was at a Grateful Dead benefit concert on the rainforests,in 1988.,I met a guy -- the guy on the left.,His name was Ben.,He said, "What can I do to save the rainforests?",I said, "Well, Ben, what do you do?","I make ice cream.",So I said, "Well, you've got to make,a rainforest ice cream.,And you've got to use nuts from the rainforests,to show that forests are worth more as forests,than they are as pasture.",He said, "Okay.",Within a year,,Rainforest Crunch was on the shelves.,It was a great success.,We did our first million-dollars-worth of trade,by buying on 30 days and selling on 21.,That gets your adrenaline going.,Then we had a four and a half million-dollar line of credit,because we were credit-worthy at that point.,We had 15 to 20, maybe 22 percent,of the global Brazil-nut market.,We paid two to three times more than anybody else.,Everybody else raised their prices to the gatherers of Brazil nuts,because we would buy it otherwise.,A great success.,50 companies signed up, 200 products came out,,generated 100 million in sales.,It failed.,Why did it fail?,Because the people who were gathering Brazil nuts,weren't the same people who were cutting the forests.,And the people who made money from Brazil nuts,were not the people who made money from cutting the forests.,We were attacking the wrong driver.,We needed to be working on beef.,We needed to be working on lumber.,We needed to be working on soy --,things that we were not focused on. 
 So let's go back to Sudan.,I often talk to refugees:,"Why was it that the West didn't realize,that famines are caused by policies and politics,,not by weather?",And this farmer said to me, one day,,something that was very profound.,He said, "You can't wake a person who's pretending to sleep." 
 (Laughter) 
 Okay. Fast forward.,We live on a planet.,There's just one of them.,We've got to wake up to the fact,that we don't have any more,and that this is a finite planet.,We know the limits of the resources we have.,We may be able to use them differently.,We may have some innovative, new ideas.,But in general, this is what we've got.,There's no more of it.,There's a basic equation that we can't get away from.,Population times consumption,has got to have some kind of relationship to the planet,,and right now, it's a simple "not equal.",Our work shows that we're living,at about 1.3 planets.,Since 1990,,we crossed the line,of being in a sustainable relationship to the planet.,Now we're at 1.3.,If we were farmers, we'd be eating our seed.,For bankers, we'd be living off the principal, not the interest.,This is where we stand today.,A lot of people like to point,to some place else as the cause of the problem.,It's always population growth.,Population growth's important,,but it's also about how much each person consumes.,So when the average American,consumes 43 times as much,as the average African,,we've got to think that consumption is an issue.,It's not just about population,,and it's not just about them; it's about us.,But it's not just about people;,it's about lifestyles.,There's very good evidence --,again, we don't necessarily have,a peer-reviewed methodology,that's bulletproof yet --,but there's very good evidence,that the average cat in Europe,has a larger environmental footprint in its lifetime,than the average African.,You think that's not an issue going forward?,You think that's not a question,as to how we should be using the Earth's resources? 
 Let's go back and visit our equation.,In 2000, we had six billion people on the planet.,They were consuming what they were consuming --,let's say one unit of consumption each.,We have six billion units of consumption.,By 2050,,we're going to have nine billion people -- all the scientists agree.,They're all going to consume twice as much as they currently do --,scientists, again, agree --,because income is going to grow in developing countries,five times what it is today --,on global average, about [2.9].,So we're going to have 18 billion units of consumption.,Who have you heard talking lately,that's said we have to triple production,of goods and services?,But that's what the math says.,We're not going to be able to do that.,We can get productivity up.,We can get efficiency up.,But we've also got to get consumption down.,We need to use less,to make more.,And then we need to use less again.,And then we need to consume less.,All of those things are part of that equation. 
 But it basically raises a fundamental question:,should consumers have a choice,about sustainability, about sustainable products?,Should you be able to buy a product that's sustainable,sitting next to one that isn't,,or should all the products on the shelf be sustainable?,If they should all be sustainable on a finite planet,,how do you make that happen?,The average consumer takes 1.8 seconds in the U.S.,Okay, so let's be generous.,Let's say it's 3.5 seconds in Europe.,How do you evaluate all the scientific data,around a product,,the data that's changing on a weekly, if not a daily, basis?,How do you get informed?,You don't.,Here's a little question.,From a greenhouse gas perspective,,is lamb produced in the U.K.,better than lamb produced in New Zealand,,frozen and shipped to the U.K.?,Is a bad feeder lot operation for beef,better or worse than,a bad grazing operation for beef?,Do organic potatoes,actually have fewer toxic chemicals,used to produce them,than conventional potatoes?,In every single case,,the answer is "it depends.",It depends on who produced it and how,,in every single instance.,And there are many others.,How is a consumer going to walk through this minefield?,They're not.,They may have a lot of opinions about it,,but they're not going to be terribly informed. 
 Sustainability has got to be a pre-competitive issue.,It's got to be something we all care about.,And we need collusion.,We need groups to work together that never have.,We need Cargill to work with Bunge.,We need Coke to work with Pepsi.,We need Oxford to work with Cambridge.,We need Greenpeace to work with WWF.,Everybody's got to work together --,China and the U.S.,We need to begin to manage this planet,as if our life depended on it,,because it does,,it fundamentally does.,But we can't do everything.,Even if we get everybody working on it,,we've got to be strategic.,We need to focus on the where,,the what and the who.,So, the where:,We've identified 35 places globally that we need to work.,These are the places that are the richest in biodiversity,and the most important from an ecosystem function point-of-view.,We have to work in these places.,We have to save these places if we want a chance in hell,of preserving biodiversity as we know it.,We looked at the threats to these places.,These are the 15 commodities,that fundamentally pose the biggest threats,to these places,because of deforestation,,soil loss, water use, pesticide use,,over-fishing, etc. 
 So we've got 35 places,,we've got 15 priority commodities,,who do we work with,to change the way those commodities are produced?,Are we going to work with 6.9 billion consumers?,Let's see, that's about 7,000 languages,,350 major languages --,a lot of work there.,I don't see anybody actually being able,to do that very effectively.,Are we going to work with 1.5 billion producers?,Again, a daunting task.,There must be a better way.,300 to 500 companies,control 70 percent or more,of the trade of each of the 15 commodities,that we've identified as the most significant.,If we work with those, if we change those companies,and the way they do business,,then the rest will happen automatically.,So, we went through our 15 commodities.,This is nine of them.,We lined them up side-by-side,,and we put the names of the companies that work,on each of those.,And if you go through the first 25 or 30 names,of each of the commodities,,what you begin to see is,,gosh, there's Cargill here, there's Cargill there,,there's Cargill everywhere.,In fact, these names start coming up over and over again.,So we did the analysis again a slightly different way.,We said: if we take the top hundred companies,,what percentage,of all 15 commodities,do they touch, buy or sell?,And what we found is it's 25 percent.,So 100 companies,control 25 percent of the trade,of all 15 of the most significant,commodities on the planet.,We can get our arms around a hundred companies.,A hundred companies, we can work with. 
 Why is 25 percent important?,Because if these companies demand sustainable products,,they'll pull 40 to 50 percent of production.,Companies can push producers,faster than consumers can.,By companies asking for this,,we can leverage production so much faster,than by waiting for consumers to do it.,After 40 years, the global organic movement,has achieved 0.7 of one percent,of global food.,We can't wait that long.,We don't have that kind of time.,We need change,that's going to accelerate.,Even working with individual companies,is not probably going to get us there.,We need to begin to work with industries.,So we've started roundtables,where we bring together the entire value chain,,from producers,all the way to the retailers and brands.,We bring in civil society, we bring in NGOs,,we bring in researchers and scientists,to have an informed discussion --,sometimes a battle royale --,to figure out what are the key impacts,of these products,,what is a global benchmark,,what's an acceptable impact,,and design standards around that.,It's not all fun and games. 
 In salmon aquaculture,,we kicked off a roundtable,almost six years ago.,Eight entities came to the table.,We eventually got, I think, 60 percent,of global production at the table,and 25 percent of demand at the table.,Three of the original eight entities were suing each other.,And yet, next week, we launch,globally verified, vetted and certified,standards for salmon aquaculture.,It can happen. 
 (Applause) 
 So what brings,the different entities to the table?,It's risk and demand.,For the big companies, it's reputational risk,,but more importantly,,they don't care what the price of commodities is.,If they don't have commodities, they don't have a business.,They care about availability,,so the big risk for them is not having product at all.,For the producers,,if a buyer wants to buy something produced a certain way,,that's what brings them to the table.,So it's the demand that brings them to the table.,The good news is,we identified a hundred companies two years ago.,In the last 18 months, we've signed agreements,with 40 of those hundred companies,to begin to work with them on their supply chain.,And in the next 18 months,,we will have signed up to work with another 40,,and we think we'll get those signed as well.,Now what we're doing is bringing the CEOs,of these 80 companies together,to help twist the arms of the final 20,,to bring them to the table,,because they don't like NGOs, they've never worked with NGOs,,they're concerned about this, they're concerned about that,,but we all need to be in this together.,So we're pulling out all the stops.,We're using whatever leverage we have to bring them to the table. 
 One company we're working with that's begun --,in baby steps, perhaps --,but has begun this journey on sustainability is Cargill.,They've funded research that shows,that we can double global palm oil production,without cutting a single tree in the next 20 years,,and do it all in Borneo alone,by planting on land that's already degraded.,The study shows that the highest net present value,for palm oil,is on land that's been degraded.,They're also undertaking a study to look at,all of their supplies of palm oil,to see if they could be certified,and what they would need to change in order to become third-party certified,under a credible certification program.,Why is Cargill important?,Because Cargill has 20 to 25 percent,of global palm oil.,If Cargill makes a decision,,the entire palm oil industry moves,,or at least 40 or 50 percent of it.,That's not insignificant.,More importantly, Cargill and one other company,ship 50 percent of the palm oil,that goes to China.,We don't have to change the way,a single Chinese company works,if we get Cargill to only send,sustainable palm oil to China.,It's a pre-competitive issue.,All the palm oil going there is good.,Buy it. 
 Mars is also on a similar journey.,Now most people understand that Mars is a chocolate company,,but Mars has made sustainability pledges,to buy only certified product for all of its seafood.,It turns out Mars buys more seafood than Walmart,because of pet food.,But they're doing some really interesting things around chocolate,,and it all comes from the fact,that Mars wants to be in business in the future.,And what they see is that they need to,improve chocolate production.,On any given plantation,,20 percent of the trees produce 80 percent of the crop,,so Mars is looking at the genome,,they're sequencing the genome of the cocoa plant.,They're doing it with IBM and the USDA,,and they're putting it in the public domain,because they want everybody to have access to this data,,because they want everybody to help them,make cocoa more productive and more sustainable.,What they've realized,is that if they can identify the traits,on productivity and drought tolerance,,they can produce 320 percent as much cocoa,on 40 percent of the land.,The rest of the land can be used for something else.,It's more with less and less again.,That's what the future has got to be,,and putting it in the public domain is smart.,They don't want to be an I.P. company; they want to be a chocolate company,,but they want to be a chocolate company forever. 
 Now, the price of food, many people complain about,,but in fact, the price of food is going down,,and that's odd because in fact,,consumers are not paying for the true cost of food.,If you take a look just at water,,what we see is that,,with four very common products,,you look at how much a farmer produced to make those products,,and then you look at how much water input was put into them,,and then you look at what the farmer was paid.,If you divide the amount of water,into what the farmer was paid,,the farmer didn't receive enough money,to pay a decent price for water in any of those commodities.,That is an externality by definition.,This is the subsidy from nature.,Coca-Cola, they've worked a lot on water,,but right now, they're entering into 17-year contracts,with growers in Turkey,to sell juice into Europe,,and they're doing that because they want to have a product,that's closer to the European market.,But they're not just buying the juice;,they're also buying the carbon in the trees,to offset the shipment costs associated with carbon,to get the product into Europe.,There's carbon that's being bought with sugar,,with coffee, with beef.,This is called bundling. It's bringing those externalities,back into the price of the commodity. 
 We need to take what we've learned in private, voluntary standards,of what the best producers in the world are doing,and use that to inform government regulation,,so we can shift the entire performance curve.,We can't just focus on identifying the best;,we've got to move the rest. 
 The issue isn't what to think, it's how to think.,These companies have begun to think differently.,They're on a journey; there's no turning back.,We're all on that same journey with them.,We have to really begin to change,the way we think about everything.,Whatever was sustainable on a planet of six billion,is not going to be sustainable on a planet with nine. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm going to talk to you,about power in this 21st century.,And basically, what I'd like to tell you,is that power is changing,,and there are two types of changes,I want to discuss.,One is power transition,,which is change of power amongst states.,And there the simple version of the message,is it's moving from West to East.,The other is power diffusion,,the way power is moving,from all states West or East,to non-state actors.,Those two things,are the huge shifts of power,in our century.,And I want to tell you about them each separately,and then how they interact,and why, in the end, there may be some good news. 
 When we talk about power transition,,we often talk about the rise of Asia.,It really should be called,the recovery or return of Asia.,If we looked at the world,in 1800,,you'd find that more than half of the world's people,lived in Asia,and they made more than half the world's product.,Now fast forward to 1900:,half the world's people -- more than half -- still live in Asia,,but they're now making,only a fifth of the world's product.,What happened? The Industrial Revolution,,which meant that all of a sudden,,Europe and America,became the dominant center of the world.,What we're going to see in the 21st century,is Asia gradually returning,to being more than half of the world's population,and more than half of the world's product.,That's important and it's an important shift.,But let me tell you a little bit about,the other shift that I'm talking about,,which is power diffusion. 
 To understand power diffusion,put this in your mind:,computing and communications costs,have fallen a thousandfold,between 1970,and the beginning of this century.,Now that's a big abstract number.,But to make it more real,,if the price of an automobile,had fallen as rapidly,as the price of computing power,,you could buy a car today,for five dollars.,Now when the price of any technology,declines that dramatically,,the barriers to entry go down.,Anybody can play in the game.,So in 1970,,if you wanted to communicate,from Oxford to Johannesburg,to New Delhi,to Brasilia,and anywhere simultaneously,,you could do it.,The technology was there.,But to be able to do it,,you had to be very rich --,a government, a multinational corporation,,maybe the Catholic Church --,but you had to be pretty wealthy.,Now, anybody has that capacity,,which previously was restricted by price,just to a few actors.,If they have the price of entry into an Internet cafe --,the last time I looked, it was something like a pound an hour --,and if you have Skype, it's free.,So capabilities,that were once restricted,are now available to everyone.,And what that means 
 is not that the age of the State is over.,The State still matters.,But the stage is crowded.,The State's not alone. There are many, many actors.,Some of that's good:,Oxfam,,a great non-governmental actor.,Some of it's bad:,Al Qaeda, another non-governmental actor.,But think of what it does,to how we think in traditional terms and concepts.,We think in terms of war,and interstate war.,And you can think back to 1941,when the government of Japan,attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor.,It's worth noticing,that a non-state actor,attacking the United States in 2001,killed more Americans,than the government of Japan did in 1941.,You might think of that,as the privatization of war.,So we're seeing a great change,in terms of diffusion of power. 
 Now the problem is,that we're not thinking about it in very innovative ways.,So let me step back,and ask: what's power?,Power is simple the ability,to affect others,to get the outcomes you want,,and you can do it in three ways.,You can do it with threats,of coercion, "sticks,",you can do it with payments,,"carrots,",or you can do it by getting others,to want what you want.,And that ability to get others to want what you want,,to get the outcomes you want,without coercion or payment,,is what I call soft power.,And that soft power has been much neglected,and much misunderstood,,and yet it's tremendously important.,Indeed, if you can learn,to use more soft power,,you can save a lot,on carrots and sticks.,Traditionally, the way people thought about power,was primarily in terms of military power.,For example, the great Oxford historian,who taught here at this university, A.J.P. Taylor,,defined a great power,as a country able to prevail in war.,But we need a new narrative,if we're to understand power in the 21st century.,It's not just prevailing at war,,though war still persists.,It's not whose army wins;,it's also whose story wins.,And we have to think much more in terms of narratives,and whose narrative is going to be effective. 
 Now let me go back,to the question,of power transition,between states,and what's happening there.,the narratives that we use now,tend to be the rise and fall,of the great powers.,And the current narrative is all about,the rise of China,and the decline of the United States.,Indeed, with the 2008 financial crisis,,many people said this was,the beginning of the end of American power.,The tectonic plates,of world politics were shifting.,And president Medvedev of Russia, for example,,pronounced in 2008,this was the beginning of the end,of United States power.,But in fact,,this metaphor of decline,is often very misleading.,If you look at history, in recent history,,you'll see the cycles of belief,in American decline,come and go every 10 or 15 years or so.,In 1958,,after the Soviets put up Sputnik,,it was "That's the end of America.",In 1973, with the oil embargo,and the closing of the gold window,,that was the end of America.,In the 1980s,,as America went through a transition in the Reagan period,,between the rust belt economy of the midwest,to the Silicon Valley economy of California,,that was the end of America.,But in fact, what we've seen,is none of those were true.,Indeed, people were over-enthusiastic,in the early 2000s,,thinking America could do anything,,which led us into some disastrous,foreign policy adventures,,and now we're back to decline again. 
 The moral of this story,is all these narratives about rise and fall and decline,tell us a lot more about psychology,than they do about reality.,If we try to focus on the reality,,then what we need to focus on,is what's really happening,in terms of China and the United States.,Goldman Sachs has projected,that China, the Chinese economy,,will surpass that of the U.S.,by 2027.,So we've got, what,,17 more years to go or so,before China's bigger.,Now someday,,with a billion point three people getting richer,,they are going to be bigger than the United States.,But be very careful about these projections,such as the Goldman Sachs projection,as though that gives you an accurate picture,of power transition in this century.,Let me mention three reasons why it's too simple.,First of all, it's a linear projection.,You know, everything says,,here's the growth rate of China, here's the growth rate of the U.S.,,here it goes -- straight line.,History is not linear.,There are often bumps along the road, accidents along the way.,The second thing is,that the Chinese economy,passes the U.S. economy in, let's say, 2030,,which it may it,,that will be a measure of total economic size,,but not of per capita income --,won't tell you about the composition of the economy.,China still has large areas,of underdevelopment,and per capita income is a better measure,of the sophistication of the economy.,And that the Chinese won't catch up or pass the Americans,until somewhere in the latter part,,after 2050, of this century. 
 The other point that's worth noticing,is how one-dimensional,this projection is.,You know, it looks at economic power,measured by GDP.,Doesn't tell you much about military power,,doesn't tell you very much about soft power.,It's all very one-dimensional.,And also, when we think about the rise of Asia,,or return of Asia,as I called it a little bit earlier,,it's worth remembering Asia's not one thing.,If you're sitting in Japan,,or in New Delhi,,or in Hanoi,,your view of the rise of China,is a little different than if you're sitting in Beijing.,Indeed, one of the advantages,that the Americans will have,in terms of power in Asia,is all those countries,want an American insurance policy,against the rise of China.,It's as though Mexico and Canada,were hostile neighbors to the United States,,which they're not.,So these simple projections,of the Goldman Sachs type,are not telling us what we need to know,about power transition. 
 But you might ask, well so what in any case?,Why does it matter? Who cares?,Is this just a game,that diplomats and academics play?,The answer is it matters quite a lot.,Because, if you believe in decline,and you get the answers wrong on this,,the facts, not the myths,,you may have policies which are very dangerous.,Let me give you an example from history.,The Peloponnesian War,was the great conflict,in which the Greek city state system,tore itself apart,two and a half millennia ago.,What caused it?,Thucydides, the great historian of the the Peloponnesian War,,said it was the rise in the power of Athens,and the fear it created in Sparta.,Notice both halves of that explanation. 
 Many people argue,that the 21st century,is going to repeat the 20th century,,in which World War One,,the great conflagration,in which the European state system,tore itself apart,and destroyed its centrality in the world,,that that was caused by,the rise in the power of Germany,and the fear it created in Britain.,So there are people who are telling us,this is going to be reproduced today,,that what we're going to see,is the same thing now in this century.,No, I think that's wrong.,It's bad history.,For one thing, Germany had surpassed Britain,in industrial strength by 1900.,And as I said earlier,,China has not passed the United States.,But also, if you have this belief,and it creates a sense of fear,,it leads to overreaction.,And the greatest danger we have,of managing this power transition,of the shift toward the East is fear.,To paraphrase Franklin Roosevelt,from a different context,,the greatest thing we have to fear is fear itself.,We don't have to fear the rise of China,or the return of Asia.,And if we have policies,in which we take it,in that larger historical perspective,,we're going to be able,to manage this process. 
 Let me say a word now,about the distribution of power,and how it relates to power diffusion,and then pull these two types together.,If you ask how is power distributed in the world today,,it's distributed much like,a three-dimensional chess game.,Top board:,military power among states.,The United States is the only superpower,,and it's likely to remain that way,for two or three decades.,China's not going to replace the U.S. on this military board.,Middle board of this three-dimensional chess game:,economic power among states.,Power is multi-polar.,There are balancers --,the U.S., Europe,,China, Japan,can balance each other.,The bottom board of this three-dimensional,,the board of transnational relations,,things that cross borders outside the control of governments,,things like climate change, drug trade,,financial flows,,pandemics,,all these things that cross borders,outside the control of governments,,there nobody's in charge.,It makes no sense to call this unipolar,or multi-polar.,Power is chaotically distributed.,And the only way you can solve these problems --,and this is where many greatest challenges,are coming in this century --,is through cooperation,,through working together,,which means that soft power becomes more important,,that ability to organize networks,to deal with these kinds of problems,and to be able to get cooperation. 
 Another way of putting it,is that as we think of power in the 21st century,,we want to get away from the idea,that power's always zero sum --,my gain is your loss and vice versa.,Power can also be positive sum,,where your gain can be my gain.,If China develops greater energy security,and greater capacity,to deal with its problems of carbon emissions,,that's good for us,as well as good for China,as well as good for everybody else.,So empowering China,to deal with its own problems of carbon,is good for everybody,,and it's not a zero sum, I win, you lose.,It's one in which we can all gain.,So as we think about power,in this century,,we want to get away from this view,that it's all I win, you lose.,Now I don't mean to be Pollyannaish about this.,Wars persist. Power persists.,Military power is important.,Keeping balances is important.,All this still persists.,Hard power is there,,and it will remain.,But unless you learn how to mix,hard power with soft power,into strategies that I call smart power,,you're not going to deal with the new kinds of problems,that we're facing. 
 So the key question that we need to think about as we look at this,is how do we work together,to produce global public goods,,things from which all of us can benefit?,How do we define our national interests,so that it's not just zero sum,,but positive sum.,In that sense, if we define our interests,,for example, for the United States,the way Britain defined its interests in the 19th century,,keeping an open trading system,,keeping a monetary stability, keeping freedom of the seas --,those were good for Britain,,they were good for others as well.,And in the 21st century, you have to do an analog to that.,How do we produce global public goods,,which are good for us,,but good for everyone at the same time?,And that's going to be the good news dimension,of what we need to think about,as we think of power in the 21st century. 
 There are ways to define our interests,in which, while protecting ourselves with hard power,,we can organize with others in networks,to produce, not only public goods,,but ways that will enhance our soft power.,So if one looks at the statements,that have been made about this,,I am impressed that when Hillary Clinton,described the foreign policy,of the Obama administration,,she said that the foreign policy of the Obama administration,was going to be smart power,,as she put it, "using all the tools,in our foreign policy tool box.",And if we're going to deal,with these two great power shifts that I've described,,the power shift represented by transition among states,,the power shift represented,by diffusion of power away from all states,,we're going to have to develop a new narrative of power,in which we combine hard and soft power,into strategies of smart power.,And that's the good news I have. We can do that. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)The Hindus say, "Nada brahma,",one translation of which is, "The world is sound.",And in a way, that's true, because everything is vibrating.,In fact, all of you as you sit here right now are vibrating.,Every part of your body is vibrating at different frequencies.,So you are, in fact, a chord --,each of you an individual chord.,One definition of health may be,that that chord is in complete harmony.,Your ears can't hear that chord;,they can actually hear amazing things. Your ears can hear 10 octaves.,Incidentally, we see just one octave.,Your ears are always on -- you have no ear lids.,They work even when you sleep.,The smallest sound you can perceive,moves your eardrum just four atomic diameters.,The loudest sound you can hear,is a trillion times more powerful than that. 
 Ears are made not for hearing,,but for listening.,Listening is an active skill,,whereas hearing is passive, listening is something that we have to work at --,it's a relationship with sound.,And yet it's a skill that none of us are taught.,For example, have you ever considered that there are listening positions,,places you can listen from?,Here are two of them.,Reductive listening is listening "for.",It reduces everything down to what's relevant,and it discards everything that's not relevant.,Men typically listen reductively.,So he's saying, "I've got this problem.",He's saying, "Here's your solution. Thanks very much. Next.",That's the way we talk, right guys? 
 Expansive listening, on the other hand,,is listening "with," not listening "for.",It's got no destination in mind --,it's just enjoying the journey.,Women typically listen expansively.,If you look at these two, eye contact, facing each other,,possibly both talking at the same time.,(Laughter),Men, if you get nothing else out of this talk,,practice expansive listening,,and you can transform your relationships. 
 The trouble with listening is that so much of what we hear,is noise, surrounding us all the time.,Noise like this, according to the European Union,,is reducing the health and the quality of life,of 25 percent,of the population of Europe.,Two percent of the population of Europe --,that's 16 million people --,are having their sleep devastated,by noise like that.,Noise kills,200,000 people a year in Europe.,It's a really big problem. 
 Now, when you were little, if you had noise and you didn't want to hear it,,you'd stick your fingers in your ears and hum.,These days, you can do a similar thing, it just looks a bit cooler.,It looks a bit like this.,The trouble with widespread headphone use,is it brings three really big health issues.,The first really big health issue is a word that Murray Schafer coined:,"schizophonia.",It's a dislocation,between what you see and what you hear.,So, we're inviting into our lives,the voices of people who are not present with us.,I think there's something deeply unhealthy,about living all the time in schizophonia. 
 The second problem that comes with headphone abuse,is compression.,We squash music to fit it into our pocket,and there is a cost attached to this.,Listen to this -- this is an uncompressed piece of music.,(Music),And now the same piece of music with 98 percent of the data removed.,(Music),I do hope that some of you at least,can hear the difference between those two.,There is a cost of compression.,It makes you tired and irritable to have to make up all of that data.,You're having to imagine it.,It's not good for you in the long run. 
 The third problem with headphones is this: deafness --,noise-induced hearing disorder.,Ten million Americans already have this for one reason or another,,but really worryingly,,16 percent --,roughly one in six -- of American teenagers,suffer from noise-induced hearing disorder,as a result of headphone abuse.,One study at an American university,found that 61 percent of college freshmen,had damaged hearing,as a result of headphone abuse.,We may be raising an entire generation of deaf people.,Now that's a really serious problem. 
 I'll give you three quick tips to protect your ears,and pass these on to your children, please.,Professional hearing protectors are great;,I use some all the time.,If you're going to use headphones, buy the best ones you can afford,because quality means you don't have to have it so loud.,If you can't hear somebody talking to you in a loud voice,,it's too loud.,And thirdly, if you're in bad sound,,it's fine to put your fingers in your ears or just move away from it.,Protect your ears in that way. 
 Let's move away from bad sound and look at some friends that I urge you to seek out.,WWB:,Wind, water, birds --,stochastic natural sounds,composed of lots of individual random events,,all of it very healthy,,all of it sound that we evolved to over the years.,Seek those sounds out; they're good for you and so it this.,Silence is beautiful.,The Elizabethans described language,as decorated silence.,I urge you to move away from silence with intention,and to design soundscapes just like works of art.,Have a foreground, a background, all in beautiful proportion.,It's fun to get into designing with sound.,If you can't do it yourself, get a professional to do it for you.,Sound design is the future,,and I think it's the way we're going to change the way the world sounds. 
 I'm going to just run quickly through eight modalities,,eight ways sound can improve health.,First, ultrasound: we're very familiar with it from physical therapy;,it's also now being used to treat cancer.,Lithotripsy -- saving thousands of people a year from the scalpel,by pulverizing stones with high-intensity sound.,Sound healing is a wonderful modality.,It's been around for thousands of years.,I do urge you to explore this.,There are great things being done there, treating now autism,,dementia and other conditions.,And music, of course. Just listening to music is good for you,,if it's music that's made with good intention,,made with love, generally.,Devotional music, good -- Mozart, good.,There are all sorts of types of music,that are very healthy. 
 And four modalities where you need to take some action,and get involved.,First of all, listen consciously.,I hope that that after this talk you'll be doing that.,It's a whole new dimension to your life and it's wonderful to have that dimension.,Secondly, get in touch with making some sound --,create sound.,The voice is the instrument we all play,,and yet how many of us are trained in using our voice? Get trained;,learn to sing, learn to play an instrument.,Musicians have bigger brains -- it's true.,You can do this in groups as well.,It's a fantastic antidote to schizophonia;,to make music and sound in a group of people,,whichever style you enjoy particularly.,And let's take a stewarding role for the sound around us.,Protect your ears? Yes, absolutely.,Design soundscapes to be beautiful around you,at home and at work.,And let's start to speak up,when people are assailing us,with the noise that I played you early on. 
 So I'm going to leave you with seven things you can do right now,to improve your health with sound.,My vision is of a world that sounds beautiful,and if we all start doing these things,,we will take a very big step in that direction.,So I urge you to take that path. 
 I'm leaving you with a little more birdsong, which is very good for you.,I wish you sound health. 
 (Applause)When I saw a piece of technology called Kinect --,it was called Natal -- I was inspired,,and I thought for a moment,,maybe it's possible,to address that one problem of storytelling,,to create a character,which seemed alive,,which noticed me,,that could look me in the eyes,and feel real,,and sculpt a story about our relationship.,And so a year ago,,I showed this off,at a computer show called E3.,And this was a piece of technology,with someone called Claire interacting with this boy.,And there was a huge row online,about, "Hey, this can't be real.",And so I waited till now,to have an actual demo,of the real tech. 
 Now, this tech incorporates,three big elements.,The first is a Kinect camera,,which will be out in November,,some incredible AI,that was hidden in the dusty vaults,,collecting dust,in Microsoft,,plus our quite crude,attempts at AI,at a company called Lionhead,,mixing all those things together,just to get to this one simple idea:,to create a real, living,being in a computer.,Now, I'll be honest with you,and say that most of it,is just a trick,,but it's a trick that actually works. 
 So why don't we go over and have,a look at the demo now.,This is Dimitri.,Dimitri, just waggle your arm around.,Now, you notice he's sitting.,There are no controllers,,no keyboards,,or mice,,or joysticks, or joypads.,He is just going to use,his hand, his body and his voice,,just like humans interact with their hands, body and voice. 
 So let's move forward.,You're going to meet Milo for the first time.,We had to give him a problem,because when we first created Milo,,we realized that he came across as a little bit of a brat,,to be honest with you.,He was quite a know-it-all,,and he wanted to kind of make you laugh.,So the problem we introduced to him was this:,he's just moved house.,He's moved from London,to New England, over in America.,His parents are too busy,to listen to his problems,,and that's when he starts almost conjuring you up.,So here he is,walking through the grass.,And you're able to interact with his world.,The cool thing is, what we're doing,is we're changing the mind,of Milo constantly.,That means no two people's Milos,can be the same.,You're actually sculpting a human being here.,So, he's discovering the garden.,You're helping him discover the garden,by just pointing out these snails.,Very simple at the start.,By the way, if you are a boy, it's snails;,if you're a girl, it's butterflies,because what we found was that girls hate snails. 
 (Laughter) 
 So remember, this is the first time you've met him,,and we really want to draw you in and make you more curious.,His face, by the way,,is fully AI-driven.,We have complete control over his blush responses,,the diameter of his nostrils,to denote stress.,We actually do something called body matching.,If you're leaning forward,,he will try and slightly change,the neuro-linguistic nature of his face,,because we went out with this strong idea:,how can we make you believe that something's real?,Now we've used the hand.,The other thing to use is your body.,Why not just, instead of pushing left and right,with a mouse or with a joypad,,why not use your body just to lean on the chair --,again, relaxed?,You can lean back,,but the camera will change its perspective,depending on which way you're looking. 
 So Dimitri's now going to use --,he's used his hand; he's used his body.,He's now going to use the other thing which is essential,,and that's his voice.,Now, the thing about voice is,,our experience with voice recognition,is pretty awful, isn't it?,It never works.,You order an airline ticket; you end up in Timbuktu.,So we've tackled that problem,,and we've come up with a solution, which we'll see in a second. 
 Milo: I could just squish it. 
 Peter Molyneux: What are you going to do, Dimitri? 
 Female Voice: Squashing a snail may not seem important,,but remember, even this choice,will affect how Milo develops.,Do you want Milo to squash it?,When you see the microphone,,say ... (PM: Squash.) ... yes to decide. 
 Dimitri: Go on, Milo. Squash it. 
 PM: No. That's the wrong thing to do.,Now look at his response.,He said, "Go on, Milo. Squash it.",What we're using there is,,we're using something, a piece of technology called Tellme.,It's a company that Microsoft acquired some years ago.,We've got a database of words which we recognize.,We pick those words out.,We also reference that,with the tonation database,that we build up of Dimitri's voice,,or the user's voice.,Now we need to have a bit more engagement,,and again, what we can do,is we can look at the body.,And we'll do that in a second. 
 Milo: I wonder how deep it is.,Deep. 
 PM: Okay. So what we're going to do now,is teach Milo to skim stones.,We're actually teaching him.,It's very, very interesting,that men, more than women,,tend to be more competitive here.,They're fine with teaching Milo for the first few throws,,but then they want to beat Milo,,where women,,they're more nurturing about this.,Okay, this is skimming stones.,How do you skim stones?,You stand up,,and you skim the stone.,It's that simple.,Just recognizing your body,,recognizing the body's motions, the tech,,understanding that you've gone,from sitting down to standing up.,Again, all of this is done,in the way us humans do things,,and that's crucially important,if we want Milo to appear real. 
 Female Voice: See if you can inspire him to do any better.,Try hitting the boat. 
 Milo: Ahhh. So close. 
 PM: That's Dimitri at his most competitive.,Now beaten an 11-year-old child. Well done. 
 Milo: Okay. 
 PM: So, Milo's being called back in by his parents,,giving us time to be alone,and to help him out.,Basically -- the bit that we missed at the start --,his parents had asked him to clean up his room.,And we're going to help him with this now.,But this is going to be an introduction,,and this is all about the deep psychology that we're trying to use.,We're trying to introduce you,to what I believe is the most wonderful part,,you being able to talk,in your natural voice to Milo.,Now, to do that, we needed a set up,,like a magician's trick.,And what we did was,,we needed to give Milo this big problem. 
 So as Dimitri,starts tidying up,,you can overhear a conversation,that Milo's having with his parents. 
 Milo's Mom: Oh, you've got gravy all over the floor. (Milo: I didn't mean to!) 
 Milo's Mom: That carpet is brand new. 
 PM: So he's just spilled,a plate of sausages on the floor,,on the brand-new carpet.,We've all done it as parents; we've all done it as children.,Now's a chance for Dimitri,to kind of reassure and calm Milo down.,It's all been too much for him.,He's just moved house. He's got no friends.,Now is the time,when we open that portal,and allow you to talk to Milo. 
 Female Voice: Why don't you try saying something encouraging,to cheer Milo up. 
 Dimitri: Come on, Milo. You know what parents are like.,They're always getting stressed. 
 Milo: What do they want to come here for anyway?,We don't know anyone. 
 Dimitri: Well, you've got a new school to go to.,You're going to meet loads of cool, new friends.,Milo: I just really miss my old house, that's all. 
 Dimitri: Well, this is a pretty awesome house, Milo.,You've got a cool garden to play in and a pond. 
 Milo: It was good skimming stones.,This looks nice.,You cleaned up my room.,Thanks. 
 PM: So after three-quarters of an hour,,he recognizes you.,And I promise you, if you're sitting in front of this screen,,that is a truly wonderful moment.,And we're ready now,to tell a story about his childhood and his life,,and it goes on,,and he has, you know, many adventures.,Some of those adventures are a little bit dark or on the darker side.,Some of those adventures are wonderfully encouraging --,he's got to go to school. 
 The cool thing is,that we're doing as well:,as you interact with him,,you're able to put things into his world; he recognizes objects.,His mind is based in a cloud.,That means Milo's mind,,as millions of people use it,,will get smarter and cleverer.,He'll recognize more objects,and thus understand more words. 
 But for me,,this is a wonderful opportunity,where technology, at last, can be connected with,,where I am no longer restrained,by the finger I hold in my hand --,as far as a computer game's concerned --,or by the blandness of not being noticed,if you're watching a film or a book.,And I love those revolutions,,and I love the future that Milo brings. 
 Thank you very much indeed. 
 (Applause)Every presentation needs this slide in it.,(Laughter),It's beautiful, isn't it?,Do you see?,All the points, all the lines --,it's incredible.,It is the network;,and in my case, the network has been important in media,,because I get to connect to people.,Isn't it amazing?,Through that, I connect to people.,And the way that I've been doing it,has been multifaceted.,For example, I get people to dress up their vacuum cleaners.,(Laughter),I put together projects like Earth Sandwich,,where I ask people,to try and simultaneously place,two pieces of bread,perfectly opposite each other on the Earth.,And people started laying bread in tribute,,and eventually a team was able to do it,between New Zealand and Spain.,It's pretty incredible -- the video's online.,Connecting to people in projects,like YoungmeNowme for example.,In YoungmeNowme, the audience was asked,to find a childhood photograph of themselves,and restage it as an adult.,(Laughter),This is the same person --,top photo, James, bottom photo, [Jennifer].,Poignant.,This was a Mother's Day gift.,(Laughter),Particularly creepy.,(Applause),(Laughter),My favorite of these photos, which I couldn't find,,is there's a picture of a 30 year-old woman or so,with a little baby on her lap,,and the next photo is a 220-lb man,with a tiny, little old lady peaking over his shoulder. 
 But this project changed the way,that I thought about connecting to people.,This is project called Ray.,And what happened was I was sent this piece of audio,and had no idea who generated the audio.,Somebody said, "You have to listen to this.",And this is what came to me. 
 Recording: Hi, my name is Ray,,and on yesterday my daughter called me,because she was stressed out,because of things that were going on on her job,that she felt was quite unfair.,Being quite disturbed, she called for comfort,,and I didn't really know what to tell her,,because we have to deal with so much mess in our society.,So I was led to write this song just for her,,just to give her some encouragement,while dealing with stress and pressures on her job.,And I figured I'd put it on the Internet,for all employees under stress,to help you better deal with what you're going through on your job.,Here's how the song goes. 
 ♫ I'm about to whip somebody's ass ♫ 
 ♫ Oh, I'm about to whip somebody's ass ♫ 
 ♫ Oh, if you don't leave me alone, ♫ 
 ♫ you gonna have to send me home ♫ 
 ♫ 'Cause I'm about to whip somebody's ass ♫ 
 Now you might not be able to sing that out loud,,but you can hum it to yourself, and you know what the words are.,And let it give you some strength to get the next few moments on your job.,All right. Stay strong. Peace. 
 Ze Frank: So -- yeah.,No, no, no, shush. We've got to go quickly.,So I was so moved by this --,this is incredible. This was connecting, right.,This was, at a distance,,realizing that someone was feeling something,,wanting to affect them in a particular way,,using media to do it, putting it online,and realizing that there was a greater impact.,This was incredible; this is what I wanted to do.,So the first thing I thought of is we have to thank him.,And I asked my audience, I said, "Listen to this piece of audio.,We have to remix it. He's got a great voice.,It's actually in the key of B flat.,And have to do something with it.",Hundreds of remixes came back -- lots of different attempts.,One stood out in particular.,It was done by a guy named Goose. 
 Remix: ♫ I'm about to whip somebody's ass ♫ 
 ♫ Oh, I'm about to whip somebody's ass ♫ 
 ♫ Oh, if you don't leave me alone, ♫ 
 ♫ You gonna have to send me home ♫ 
 ♫ Cuz I'm about to whip somebody's ass ♫ 
 ♫ I'm about to whip some ♫ -- 
 ZF: Great, so it was incredible.,That song -- (Applause) Thank you.,So that song, somebody told me that it was at a baseball game,in Kansas City.,In the end,,it was one of the top downloads,on a whole bunch of music streaming services.,And so I said, "Let's put this together in an album.",And the audience came together, and they designed an album cover.,And I said, "If you put it all on this, I'm going to deliver it to him,,if you can figure out who this person is,",because all I had was his name -- Ray --,and this little piece of audio,and the fact that his daughter was upset.,In two weeks, they found him.,I received and email and it said,,"Hi, I'm Ray.,I heard you were looking for me.",(Laughter),And I was like, "Yeah, Ray.,It's been an interesting two weeks.",And so I flew to St. Louis,and met Ray,,and he's a preacher --,(Laughter),among other things. 
 So but anyways, here's the thing --,is it reminds me of this,,which is a sign that you see in Amsterdam on every street corner.,And it's sort of a metaphor for me for the virtual world.,I look at this photo, and he seems really interested,in what's going on with that button,,but it doesn't seem like he is really that interested in crossing the street.,(Laughter),And it makes me think of this.,On street corners everywhere, people are looking at their cell phones,,and it's easy to dismiss this,as some sort of bad trend,in human culture.,But the truth is,life is being lived there.,When they smile --,right, you've seen people stop --,all of a sudden, life is being lived there,,somewhere up in that weird, dense network.,And this is it, right, to feel and be felt.,It's the fundamental force,that we're all after.,We can build all sorts of environments,to make it a little bit easier,,but ultimately, what we're trying to do,is really connect with one other person.,And that's not always going to happen in physical spaces.,It's also going to now happen in virtual spaces,,and we have to get better at figuring that out.,I think, of the people that build all this technology in the network,,a lot of them aren't very good,at connecting with people.,This is kind of like something I used to do,in third grade. 
 (Laughter) 
 So here's a series of projects,over the last few years,where I've been inspired by trying to figure out,how to really facilitate close connection.,Sometimes they're very, very simple things.,A Childhood Walk, which is a project,where I ask people to remember a walk,that they used to take as a child over and over again,that was sort of meaningless --,like on the route to the bus stop, to a neighbor's house,,and take it inside of Google Streetview.,And I promise you,,if you take that walk inside Google Streetview,,you come to a moment,where something comes back,and hits you in the face.,And I collected those moments --,the photos inside Google Streetview,and the memories, specifically.,"Our conversation started with me saying, 'I'm bored,',and her replying, 'When I'm bored I eat pretzels.',I remember this distinctly because it came up a lot.","Right after he told me and my brother,he was going to be separating from my mom,,I remember walking to a convenience store,and getting a cherry cola.","They used some of the morbidly artist footage,,a close-up of Chad's shoes in the middle of the highway.,I guess the shoes came off when he was hit.,He slept over at my house once, and he left his pillow.,It had 'Chad' written in magic marker on it.,He died long after he left the pillow at my house,,but we never got around to returning it." 
 Sometimes they're a little bit more abstract.,This is Pain Pack.,Right after September 11th, last year,,I was thinking about pain and the way that we disperse it,,the way that we excise it from our bodies.,So what I did is I opened up a hotline --,a hotline where people could leave voicemails of their pain,,not necessarily related to that event.,And people called in and left messages like this. 
 Recording: Okay, here's something.,I'm not alone,,and I am loved.,I'm really fortunate.,But sometimes I feel really lonely.,And when I feel that way,even the smallest act of kindness,can make me cry.,Like even people in convenience stores,saying, "Have a nice day,",when they're accidentally looking me in the eye. 
 ZF: So what I did was I took those voicemails,,and with their permission, converted them to MP3s,and distributed them to sound editors,who created short sounds,using just those voicemails.,And those were then distributed to DJs,who have made hundreds of songs,using that source material.,(Music),We don't have time to play much of it.,You can look at it online. 
 "From 52 to 48 with love",was a project around the time of the last election cycle,,where McCain and Obama both,,in their speeches after the election, talked about reconciliation,,and I was like, "What the hell,does that look like?",So I thought, "Well let's just give it a try.,Let's have people hold up signs about reconciliation.",And so some really nice things came together.,"I voted blue. I voted red.,Together, for our future.",These are very, very cute little things right.,Some came from the winning party.,"Dear 48, I promise to listen to you, to fight for you, to respect you always.",Some came from the party who had just lost.,"From a 48 to a 52, may your party's leadership be as classy as you,,but I doubt it.",But the truth was that as this start becoming popular,,a couple rightwing blogs and some message boards,apparently found it to be a little patronizing,,which I could also see.,And so I started getting amazing amounts of hate mail,,death threats even.,And one guy in particular kept on writing me these pretty awful messages,,and he was dressed as Batman.,And he said, "I'm dressed as Batman to hide my identity.",Just in case I thought the real Batman,was coming after me;,which actually made me feel a little better --,like, "Phew, it's not him." 
 So what I did --,unfortunately, I was harboring all this kind of,awful experience and this pain inside of me,,and it started to eat away at my psyche.,And I was protecting the project from it, I realized. I was protecting it --,I didn't want this special, little group of photographs,to get sullied in some way.,So what I did, I took all those emails,,and I put them together into something called Angrigami,,which was an origami template,made out of this sort of vile stuff.,And I asked people to send me beautiful things,made out of the Angrigami.,(Laughter),But this was the emotional moment.,One of my viewer's uncles died on a particular day,and he chose to commemorate it with a piece of hate.,It's amazing. 
 The last thing I'm going to tell you about is a series of projects,called Songs You Already Know,,where the idea was,,I was trying to figure out to address,particular kinds of emotions with group projects.,So one of them was fairly straightforward.,A guy said that his daughter got scared at night,and could I write a song for her, his daughter.,And I said, "Oh yeah,,I'll try to write a mantra that she can sing to herself,to help herself go to sleep.",And this was "Scared." 
 (Video) ♫ This is a song that I sing when I'm scared of something ♫ 
 ♫ I don't know why but it helps me get over it ♫ 
 ♫ The words of the song just move me along ♫ 
 ♫ And somehow I get over it ♫ 
 ♫ At least I don't suck at life ♫ 
 ♫ I keep on trying despite ♫ 
 ♫ At least I don't suck at life ♫ 
 ♫ I keep on trying despite ♫ 
 ♫ This is a song that I sing when I'm scared of something ♫ 
 Okay, so I wrote that song, right. Thank you.,So the nice thing was is he walked by his daughter's room at some point,,and she actually was singing that song to herself.,So I was like, "Awesome. This is great." 
 And then I got this email. And there's a little bit of a back story to this.,And I don't have much time.,But the idea was that at one point,I did a project called Facebook Me Equals You,,where I wanted to experience what it was like,to live as another person.,So I asked for people's usernames and passwords to be sent to me.,And I got a lot, like 30 in a half an hour.,And I shut that part down.,And I chose two people to be,,and I asked them to send me descriptions,of how to act as them on Facebook.,One person sent me a very detailed description;,the other person didn't.,And the person who didn't, it turned out,,had just moved to a new city and taken on a new job.,So, you know, people were writing me and saying, "How's your new job?",I was like, "I don't know.,Didn't know I had one." 
 But anyway, this same person, Laura,,ended up emailing me a little bit after that project.,And I felt badly for not having done a good job.,And she said, "I'm really anxious, I just moved to a new town, I have this new job,,and I've just had this incredible amount of anxiety.",So she had seen the "Scared" song and wondered if I could do something.,So I asked her, "What does it feel like when you feel this way?",And she wrote a sort of descriptive set,of what it felt like to have had this anxiety.,And so what I decided to do.,I said, "Okay, I'll think about it.",And so quietly in the background, I started sending people this. 
 (Audio) ♫ Hey ♫ 
 ♫ You're okay ♫ 
 ♫ You'll be fine ♫ 
 So I asked people,whether they had basic audio capabilities,,just so they could sing along to the song with headphones on,,so I could just get their voices back.,And this is the kind of thing that I got back. 
 Recording: ♫ Hey ♫ 
 ♫ You're okay ♫ 
 ♫ You'll be fine ♫ 
 ZF: So that's one of the better ones, really.,But what's awesome is, as I started getting more and more and more of them,,all of a sudden I had 30, 40 voices from around the world.,And when you put them together, something magical happens,,something absolutely incredible happens,,and all of a sudden I get a chorus from around the world.,And what was really great is, I'm putting all this work together in the background,,and Laura sent me a follow-up email because a good month had passed by.,And she said, "I know you've forgotten about me.,I just want to say thanks for even considering it.",And then a few days later I sent her this. 
 (Audio) ♫ Right now, it feels like I forgot to turn the light on ♫ 
 ♫ And things that looked so good yesterday ♫ 
 ♫ are now shades of gray ♫ 
 ♫ And it seems like the world is spinning ♫ 
 ♫ while I'm standing still ♫ 
 ♫ Or maybe I am spinning I can't tell ♫ 
 ♫ And then you say ♫ 
 ♫ Hey ♫ 
 ♫ You're okay ♫ 
 ♫ You'll be fine ♫ 
 ♫ Just breathe ♫ 
 ♫ And now the words sing ♫ 
 ♫ Hey ♫ 
 ♫ You're okay ♫ 
 ♫ You'll be fine ♫ 
 ♫ Just breathe ♫ 
 ♫ Now everybody sings ♫ 
 ♫ Hey ♫ 
 ♫ You're okay ♫ 
 ♫ You'll be fine ♫ 
 ♫ Just breathe ♫ 
 ♫ Hey ♫ 
 ♫ You're okay ♫ 
 ♫ You'll be fine ♫ 
 ♫ Just breathe ♫ 
 ♫ Hey ♫ 
 ♫ You're okay ♫ 
 ♫ You'll be fine ♫ 
 ♫ Just breathe ♫ 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Running: it's basically justnright, left, right, left, yeah?,I mean, we've been doing itnfor two million years,,so it's kind of arrogant to assumenthat I've got something to say,that hasn't been said and performednbetter a long time ago.,But the cool thing about running,nas I've discovered,,is that something bizarre happensnin this activity all the time.,Case in point: A couple months ago,nif you saw the New York City Marathon,,I guarantee you, you saw somethingnthat no one has ever seen before. 
 An Ethiopian woman named Derartu Tulunturns up at the starting line.,She's 37 years old.,She hasn't won a marathonnof any kind in eight years,,and a few months previously,,she had almost died in childbirth.,Derartu Tulu was ready to hang it upnand retire from the sport,,but she decided she'd go for broke,and try for one last big paydaynin the marquee event,,the New York City Marathon.,Except -- bad news for Derartu Tulu --nsome other people had the same idea,,including the Olympic gold medalist,,and Paula Radcliffe, who is a monster,,the fastest woman marathonernin history by far.,Only 10 minutesnoff the men's world record,,Paula Radcliffe is essentially unbeatable.,That's her competition. 
 The gun goes off, and -- I mean,nshe's not even an underdog;,she's, like, under the underdogs.,But the under-underdog hangs tough,,and 22 miles into a 26-mile race,,there is Derartu Tulu,nup there with the lead pack.,Now, this is when somethingnreally bizarre happens.,Paula Radcliffe, the one personnwho is sure to snatch the big paycheck,from Derartu Tulu's under-underdog hands,,suddenly grabs her legnand starts to fall back.,So we all know what to donin this situation, right?,You give her a quick cracknin the teeth with your elbow,and blaze for the finish line.,Derartu Tulu ruins the script.,Instead of taking off,,she falls back and she grabsnPaula Radcliffe,,and says, "Come on.nCome with us. You can do it.",So Paula Radcliffe,nunfortunately, does it.,She catches up with the lead pack,and is pushing toward the finish line.,But then she falls back again.,The second time, Derartu Tulungrabs her and tries to pull her.,And Paula Radcliffe, at that point,nsays, "I'm done. Go.",So that's a fantastic story,nand we all know how it ends.,She loses the check,,but she goes home with somethingnbigger and more important.,Except Derartu Tulunruins the script again.,Instead of losing, she blazesnpast the lead pack and wins.,Wins the New York City Marathon,,goes home with a big fat check. 
 It's a heartwarming story,,but if you drill a little bit deeper,,you've got to sort of wondernabout what exactly was going on there.,When you have two outliersnin one organism,,it's not a coincidence.,When you have someone who is morencompetitive and more compassionate,than anybody else in the race,nagain, it's not a coincidence.,You show me a creaturenwith webbed feet and gills;,somehow water's involved. 
 Someone with that kind of heart,nthere's some kind of connection there.,And the answer to it,nI think, can be found,down in the Copper Canyons of Mexico,,where there's a reclusive tribe,ncalled the Tarahumara Indians.,Now, the Tarahumaranare remarkable for three things.,Number one is:,they have been living essentiallynunchanged for the past 400 years.,When the conquistadors arrivednin North America you had two choices:,you either fight back and engagenor you could take off.,The Mayans and Aztecs engaged,,which is why there are very fewnMayans and Aztecs.,The Tarahumara had a different strategy.,They took off and hid,in this labyrinthine, networking,nspider-webbing system of canyons,called the Copper Canyons.,And there they've remainednsince the 1600s,,essentially the same waynthey've always been. 
 The second thing remarkablenabout the Tarahumara is:,deep into old age -- 70 to 80 years old --,these guys aren't running marathons;,they're running mega-marathons.,They're not doing 26 miles,,they're doing 100, 150 miles at a time,,and apparently without injury,nwithout problems. 
 The last thing that's remarkablenabout the Tarahumara is:,all the things we're goingnto be talking about today,,all the things we're trying to usenall of our technology,and brain power to solve --,things like heart diseasenand cholesterol and cancer;,crime, warfare and violence;nclinical depression -- all this stuff --,the Tarahumara don't knownwhat you're talking about.,They are free from allnof these modern ailments. 
 So what's the connection?,Again, we're talking about outliers;,there's got to be some kindnof cause and effect.,Well, there are teams of scientistsnat Harvard and the University of Utah,that are bending their brainsnand trying to figure out,what the Tarahumara have known forever.,They're trying to solventhose same kinds of mysteries.,And once again, a mysterynwrapped inside of a mystery --,perhaps the key to Derartu Tulunand the Tarahumara,is wrapped in three othernmysteries, which go like this:,Three things -- if you have the answer,ncome up and take the microphone,,because nobody else knows the answer.,If you know it, you're smarternthan anybody on planet Earth. 
 Mystery number one is this:,Two million years ago,nthe human brain exploded in size.,Australopithecusnhad a tiny little pea brain.,Suddenly humans show up,nHomo erectus, big old melon head.,To have a brain of that size,,you need to have a sourcenof condensed caloric energy.,In other words, early humansnare eating dead animals --,no argument, that's a fact.,The only problem is,,the first edged weapons only appearednabout 200,000 years ago. 
 So somehow, for nearly two million years,,we are killing animalsnwithout any weapons.,Now, we're not using our strength,,because we are the biggestnsissies in the jungle.,Every other animalnis stronger than we are,,they have fangs, they have claws,nthey have nimbleness, they have speed.,We think Usain Bolt is fast.,Usain Bolt can getnhis ass kicked by a squirrel.,We're not fast.,That would be an Olympic event:,turn a squirrel loose,nwhoever catches it gets a gold medal. 
 (Laughter) 
 So no weapons, no speed,nno strength, no fangs, no claws.,How were we killing these animals?nMystery number one. 
 Mystery number two:,Women have been in the Olympicsnfor quite some time now,,but one thing that's remarkablenabout all women sprinters:,they all suck; they're terrible.,There's not a fast woman on the planetnand there never has been.,The fastest womannto ever run a mile did it in 4:15.,I could throw a rocknand hit a high-school boy,who can run faster than 4:15.,For some reason,nyou guys are just really slow.,But -- 
 (Laughter) 
 But, you get to the marathonnwe were just talking about --,you've only been allowed to runnthe marathon for 20 years,,because prior to the 1980s,nmedical science said,if a woman tried to run 26 miles --ndoes anyone know what would happen,if you tried to run 26 miles?,Why you were bannednfrom the marathon before the 1980s? 
 Audience Member: Her uterus would be torn. 
 Christopher McDougall:nHer uterus would be torn, yes.,Torn reproductive organs.,The uterus would literallynfall out of the body. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, I've been to a lot of marathons,,and I've yet to see any ... 
 (Laughter) 
 So it's only been 20 years,that women have been allowednto run the marathon.,In that very short learning curve,nyou've gone from broken organs,up to the fact that you're only 10 minutesnoff the male world record. 
 Then you go beyond 26 miles,ninto the distance,that medical science also told usnwould be fatal to humans --,remember Pheidippides diednwhen he ran 26 miles --,you get to 50 and 100 miles,nand suddenly, it's a different game.,You take a runner like Ann Trasonnor Nikki Kimball or Jenn Shelton,,put them in a race of 50 or 100 milesnagainst anybody in the world,,and it's a coin toss who's going to win.,I'll give you an example.,A couple years ago,nEmily Baer signed up for a race,called the Hardrock 100,,which tells you all you neednto know about the race.,They give you 48 hoursnto finish this race.,Well, Emily Baer -- 500 runners --,she finishes in eighth place,nin the top 10,,even though she stoppednat all the aid stations,to breastfeed her baby during the race. 
 (Laughter) 
 And yet, she beat 492 other people.,The last mystery:,Why is it that women get strongernas distances get longer?,The third mystery is this:,At the University of Utah,nthey started tracking finishing times,for people running the marathon.,What they found is that if you startnrunning the marathon at age 19,,you'll get progressivelynfaster, year by year,,until you reach your peak at age 27.,And then after that,nyou succumb to the rigors of time.,And you'll get slower and slower,,until eventually you're back to runningnthe same speed you were at age 19.,So about seven, eight yearsnto reach your peak,,and then gradually you fall off your peak,,until you go back to the starting point.,You'd think it might take eight yearsnto go back to the same speed,,maybe 10 years -- no, it's 45 years.,64-year-old men and women,are running as fastnas they were at age 19.,Now, I defy you to comenup with any other physical activity --,and please don't say golf --nsomething that's actually hard -- 
 (Laughter) 
 where geriatrics are performingnas well as they did as teenagers. 
 So you have these three mysteries.,Is there one piece in the puzzlenwhich might wrap all these things up?,You've got to be careful anytimensomeone looks back in prehistory,and tries to give youna global answer because,,it being prehistory, you can saynwhatever the hell you want,and get away with it.,But I'll submit this to you:,If you put one piece in the middlenof this jigsaw puzzle,,suddenly it all startsnto form a coherent picture.,If you're wonderingnwhy the Tarahumara don't fight,and don't die of heart disease,,why a poor Ethiopiannwoman named Derartu Tulu,can be the most compassionatenand yet the most competitive,,and why we somehow were ablento find food without weapons,,perhaps it's because humans,,as much as we like to think of ourselvesnas masters of the universe,,actually evolved as nothing morenthan a pack of hunting dogs. 
 Maybe we evolved as a hunting pack animal.,Because the one advantagenwe have in the wilderness --,again, it's not our fangs,nour claws or our speed --,the only thing we do really well is sweat.,We're really goodnat being sweaty and smelly.,Better than any other mammalnon Earth, we can sweat really well.,But the advantage of that little bitnof social discomfort,is the fact that, when it comes to runningnunder hot heat for long distances,,we're superb -- the best on the planet.,You take a horse on a hot day,,and after about five or six miles,nthat horse has a choice:,it's either going to breathenor it's going to cool off.,But it ain't doing both. We can.,So what if we evolvednas hunting pack animals?,What if the only natural advantagenwe had in the world,was the fact that we couldnget together as a group,,go out there on that African savanna,npick out an antelope,,go out as a pack,nand run that thing to death?,That's all we could do.,We could run really far on a hot day. 
 Well, if that's true, a couplenother things had to be true as well.,The key to being partnof a hunting pack is the word "pack.",If you go out by yourselfnand try to chase an antelope,,I guarantee there will be two cadaversnout in the savanna.,You need a pack to pull together.,You need to haventhose 64- and 65-year-olds,who have been doing this for a long time,to understand which antelopenyou're trying to catch.,The herd explodesnand it gathers back again.,Those expert trackersnhave to be part of the pack.,They can't be 10 miles behind.,You need the womennand the adolescents there,,because the two times in your lifenyou most benefit from animal protein,is when you're a nursing mothernand a developing adolescent.,It makes no sense to haventhe antelope over there, dead,,and the people who wantnto eat it 50 miles away.,They need to be part of the pack.,You need those 27-year-old studsnat the peak of their powers,ready to drop the kill,,and you need those teenagersnwho are learning the whole thing involved.,The pack stays together. 
 Another thing that has to be true:nthis pack cannot be materialistic.,You can't be hauling all your crap around,ntrying to chase the antelope.,You can't be a pissed-off pack.,You can't be bearing grudges, like,n"I'm not chasing that guy's antelope.,He pissed me off.nLet him go chase his own antelope.",The pack has got to be ablento swallow its ego,,be cooperative, and pull together.,What you end up with, in other words,,is a culture remarkably similarnto the Tarahumara,,a tribe that has remainednunchanged since the Stone Age.,It's a really compelling argument,that maybe the Tarahumara are doingnexactly what all of us had done,for two million years,,that it's us in modern timesnwho have sort of gone off the path. 
 You know, we look at runningnas this kind of alien, foreign thing,,this punishment you've got to donbecause you ate pizza the night before.,But maybe it's something different.,Maybe we're the ones who have takennthis natural advantage we had,and we spoiled it.,How do we spoil it?nWell, how do we spoil anything?,We try to cash in on it. Right?,We try to can it and package itnand make it "better",and then sell it to people.,And then what happened was,nwe started creating,these fancy cushioned thingsnwhich can make running "better,",called running shoes. 
 The reason I get personallynpissed-off about running shoes,is because I bought a million of themnand I kept getting hurt.,And I think if anybody in here runs --,I just had a conversation with Carol.,We talked for two minutes backstage,nand she talked about plantar fasciitis.,You talk to a runner,nI guarantee within 30 seconds,,the conversation turns to injury.,So if humans evolved as runners,nif that's our one natural advantage,,then why are we so bad at it?,Why do we keep getting hurt? 
 A curious thing about runningnand running injuries,is that the running injurynis new to our time.,If you read folklore and mythology,,any kind of myths, any kind of tall tales,,running is always associatednwith freedom and vitality,and youthfulness and eternal vigor.,It's only in our lifetimenthat running has become associated,with fear and pain.,Geronimo used to say, "My only friendsnare my legs. I only trust my legs.",That's because an Apache triathlonnused to be you'd run 50 miles,across the desert,,engage in hand-to-hand combat,nsteal a bunch of horses,,and slap leather for home.,Geronimo was never saying, "You knownsomething, my Achilles -- I'm tapering.,I've got to take this week off.",Or, "I need to cross-train.nI didn't do yoga. I'm not ready." 
 (Laughter) 
 Humans ran and ran all the time.,We are here today.nWe have our digital technology.,All of our science comes from the fact,that our ancestors were able to donsomething extraordinary every day,,which was just relynon their naked feet and legs,to run long distances. 
 So how do we get back to that again?,Well, I would submitnto you the first thing is:,get rid of all packaging,nall the sales, all the marketing.,Get rid of all the stinking running shoes.,Stop focusing on urban marathons,,which, if you do four hours, you suck,,and if you do 3:59:59, you're awesome,,because you qualified for another race.,We need to get back to that sensenof playfulness and joyfulness,and, I would say, nakedness,,that has made the Tarahumara,one of the healthiest and serenencultures in our time.,So what's the benefit? So what?,So you burn off the Häagen-Dazsnfrom the night before. 
 But maybe there's anothernbenefit there as well.,Without getting too extreme about this,,imagine a world where everybodyncould go out the door,and engage in the kind of exercise,that's going to make themnmore relaxed, more serene,,more healthy,,burn off stress --,where you don't come back into your officena raging maniac anymore,,or go home with a lot of stressnon top of you again.,Maybe there's somethingnbetween what we are today,and what the Tarahumara have always been.,I don't say let's go backnto the Copper Canyons,and live on corn and maize,nwhich is the Tarahumara's preferred diet,,but maybe there's somewhere in between.,And if we find that thing,,maybe there is a big fatnNobel Prize out there.,Because if somebody could find a waynto restore that natural ability,that we all enjoyednfor most of our existence,up until the 1970s or so,,the benefits -- social and physicalnand political and mental --,could be astounding. 
 What I've been seeing todaynis there is a growing subculture,of barefoot runners,npeople who've gotten rid of their shoes.,And what they have found uniformly is,,you get rid of the shoes,nyou get rid of the stress,,you get rid of the injuriesnand the ailments.,And what you find is somethingnthe Tarahumara have known,for a very long time:,that this can be a whole lot of fun.,I've experienced it personally myself.,I was injured all my life; thennin my early 40s, I got rid of my shoes,and my running ailmentsnhave gone away, too. 
 So hopefully it's somethingnwe can all benefit from.,I appreciate your listening to this story. 
 Thanks very much. 
 (Applause)When I was a student here in Oxford in the 1970s,,the future of the world was bleak.,The population explosion was unstoppable.,Global famine was inevitable.,A cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment,was going to shorten our lives.,The acid rain was falling on the forests.,The desert was advancing by a mile or two a year.,The oil was running out,,and a nuclear winter would finish us off.,None of those things happened,,(Laughter),and astonishingly, if you look at what actually happened in my lifetime,,the average per-capita income,of the average person on the planet,,in real terms, adjusted for inflation,,has tripled.,Lifespan is up by 30 percent in my lifetime.,Child mortality is down by two-thirds.,Per-capita food production,is up by a third.,And all this at a time when the population has doubled. 
 How did we achieve that, whether you think it's a good thing or not?,How did we achieve that?,How did we become,the only species,that becomes more prosperous,as it becomes more populous?,The size of the blob in this graph represents the size of the population,,and the level of the graph,represents GDP per capita.,I think to answer that question,you need to understand,how human beings bring together their brains,and enable their ideas to combine and recombine,,to meet and, indeed, to mate.,In other words, you need to understand,how ideas have sex. 
 I want you to imagine,how we got from making objects like this,to making objects like this.,These are both real objects.,One is an Acheulean hand axe from half a million years ago,of the kind made by Homo erectus.,The other is obviously a computer mouse.,They're both exactly the same size and shape to an uncanny degree.,I've tried to work out which is bigger,,and it's almost impossible.,And that's because they're both designed to fit the human hand.,They're both technologies. In the end, their similarity is not that interesting.,It just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand.,The differences are what interest me,,because the one on the left was made to a pretty unvarying design,for about a million years --,from one-and-a-half million years ago to half a million years ago.,Homo erectus made the same tool,for 30,000 generations.,Of course there were a few changes,,but tools changed slower than skeletons in those days.,There was no progress, no innovation.,It's an extraordinary phenomenon, but it's true.,Whereas the object on the right is obsolete after five years.,And there's another difference too,,which is the object on the left is made from one substance.,The object on the right is made from,a confection of different substances,,from silicon and metal and plastic and so on.,And more than that, it's a confection of different ideas,,the idea of plastic, the idea of a laser,,the idea of transistors.,They've all been combined together in this technology. 
 And it's this combination,,this cumulative technology, that intrigues me,,because I think it's the secret to understanding,what's happening in the world.,My body's an accumulation of ideas too:,the idea of skin cells, the idea of brain cells, the idea of liver cells.,They've come together.,How does evolution do cumulative, combinatorial things?,Well, it uses sexual reproduction.,In an asexual species, if you get two different mutations in different creatures,,a green one and a red one,,then one has to be better than the other.,One goes extinct for the other to survive.,But if you have a sexual species,,then it's possible for an individual,to inherit both mutations,from different lineages.,So what sex does is it enables the individual,to draw upon,the genetic innovations of the whole species.,It's not confined to its own lineage. 
 What's the process that's having the same effect,in cultural evolution,as sex is having in biological evolution?,And I think the answer is exchange,,the habit of exchanging one thing for another.,It's a unique human feature.,No other animal does it.,You can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange --,and indeed there's reciprocity in other animals --,But the exchange of one object for another never happens.,As Adam Smith said, "No man ever saw a dog,make a fair exchange of a bone with another dog.",(Laughter),You can have culture without exchange.,You can have, as it were, asexual culture.,Chimpanzees, killer whales, these kinds of creatures, they have culture.,They teach each other traditions,which are handed down from parent to offspring.,In this case, chimpanzees teaching each other,how to crack nuts with rocks.,But the difference is,that these cultures never expand, never grow,,never accumulate, never become combinatorial,,and the reason is because,there is no sex, as it were,,there is no exchange of ideas.,Chimpanzee troops have different cultures in different troops.,There's no exchange of ideas between them. 
 And why does exchange raise living standards?,Well, the answer came from David Ricardo in 1817.,And here is a Stone Age version of his story,,although he told it in terms of trade between countries.,Adam takes four hours to make a spear and three hours to make an axe.,Oz takes one hour to make a spear and two hours to make an axe.,So Oz is better at both spears and axes than Adam.,He doesn't need Adam.,He can make his own spears and axes.,Well no, because if you think about it,,if Oz makes two spears and Adam make two axes,,and then they trade,,then they will each have saved an hour of work.,And the more they do this, the more true it's going to be,,because the more they do this, the better Adam is going to get at making axes,and the better Oz is going to get at making spears.,So the gains from trade are only going to grow.,And this is one of the beauties of exchange,,is it actually creates the momentum,for more specialization,,which creates the momentum for more exchange and so on.,Adam and Oz both saved an hour of time.,That is prosperity, the saving of time,in satisfying your needs. 
 Ask yourself how long you would have to work,to provide for yourself,an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by.,If you had to start from scratch, let's say you go out into the countryside.,You find a sheep. You kill it. You get the fat out of it.,You render it down. You make a candle, etc. etc.,How long is it going to take you? Quite a long time.,How long do you actually have to work,to earn an hour of reading light,if you're on the average wage in Britain today?,And the answer is about half a second.,Back in 1950,,you would have had to work for eight seconds on the average wage,to acquire that much light.,And that's seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you've gained,since 1950, as it were,,because that's seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else,,or you can acquire another good or service.,And back in 1880,,it would have been 15 minutes,to earn that amount of light on the average wage.,Back in 1800,,you'd have had to work six hours,to earn a candle that could burn for an hour.,In other words, the average person on the average wage,could not afford a candle in 1800. 
 Go back to this image of the axe and the mouse,,and ask yourself: "Who made them and for who?",The stone axe was made by someone for himself.,It was self-sufficiency.,We call that poverty these days.,But the object on the right,was made for me by other people.,How many other people?,Tens? Hundreds? Thousands?,You know, I think it's probably millions.,Because you've got to include the man who grew the coffee,,which was brewed for the man who was on the oil rig,,who was drilling for oil, which was going to be made into the plastic, etc.,They were all working for me,,to make a mouse for me.,And that's the way society works.,That's what we've achieved as a species. 
 In the old days, if you were rich,,you literally had people working for you.,That's how you got to be rich; you employed them.,Louis XIV had a lot of people working for him.,They made his silly outfits, like this,,(Laughter),and they did his silly hairstyles, or whatever.,He had 498 people,to prepare his dinner every night.,But a modern tourist going around the palace of Versailles,and looking at Louis XIV's pictures,,he has 498 people doing his dinner tonight too.,They're in bistros and cafes and restaurants,and shops all over Paris,,and they're all ready to serve you at an hour's notice with an excellent meal,that's probably got higher quality,than Louis XIV even had.,And that's what we've done, because we're all working for each other.,We're able to draw upon specialization and exchange,to raise each other's living standards. 
 Now, you do get other animals working for each other too.,Ants are a classic example; workers work for queens and queens work for workers.,But there's a big difference,,which is that it only happens within the colony.,There's no working for each other across the colonies.,And the reason for that is because there's a reproductive division of labor.,That is to say, they specialize with respect to reproduction.,The queen does it all.,In our species, we don't like doing that.,It's the one thing we insist on doing for ourselves, is reproduction.,(Laughter),Even in England, we don't leave reproduction to the Queen. 
 (Applause) 
 So when did this habit start?,And how long has it been going on? And what does it mean?,Well, I think, probably, the oldest version of this,is probably the sexual division of labor.,But I've got no evidence for that.,It just looks like the first thing we did,was work male for female and female for male.,In all hunter-gatherer societies today,,there's a foraging division of labor,between, on the whole, hunting males and gathering females.,It isn't always quite that simple,,but there's a distinction between,specialized roles for males and females.,And the beauty of this system,is that it benefits both sides.,The woman knows,that, in the Hadzas' case here --,digging roots to share with men in exchange for meat --,she knows that all she has to do to get access to protein,is to dig some extra roots and trade them for meat.,And she doesn't have to go on an exhausting hunt,and try and kill a warthog.,And the man knows that he doesn't have to do any digging,to get roots.,All he has to do is make sure that when he kills a warthog,it's big enough to share some.,And so both sides raise each other's standards of living,through the sexual division of labor. 
 When did this happen? We don't know, but it's possible,that Neanderthals didn't do this.,They were a highly cooperative species.,They were a highly intelligent species.,Their brains on average, by the end, were bigger than yours and mine,in this room today.,They were imaginative. They buried their dead.,They had language, probably,,because we know they had the FOXP2 gene of the same kind as us,,which was discovered here in Oxford.,And so it looks like they probably had linguistic skills.,They were brilliant people. I'm not dissing the Neanderthals.,But there's no evidence,of a sexual division of labor.,There's no evidence of gathering behavior by females.,It looks like the females were cooperative hunters with the men.,And the other thing there's no evidence for,is exchange between groups,,because the objects that you find in Neanderthal remains,,the tools they made,,are always made from local materials.,For example, in the Caucasus,there's a site where you find local Neanderthal tools.,They're always made from local chert.,In the same valley there are modern human remains,from about the same date, 30,000 years ago,,and some of those are from local chert,,but more -- but many of them are made,from obsidian from a long way away.,And when human beings began,moving objects around like this,,it was evidence that they were exchanging between groups. 
 Trade is 10 times as old as farming.,People forget that. People think of trade as a modern thing.,Exchange between groups has been going on,for a hundred thousand years.,And the earliest evidence for it crops up,somewhere between 80 and 120,000 years ago in Africa,,when you see obsidian and jasper and other things,moving long distances in Ethiopia.,You also see seashells --,as discovered by a team here in Oxford --,moving 125 miles inland,from the Mediterranean in Algeria.,And that's evidence that people,have started exchanging between groups.,And that will have led to specialization. 
 How do you know that long-distance movement,means trade rather than migration?,Well, you look at modern hunter gatherers like aboriginals,,who quarried for stone axes at a place called Mount Isa,,which was a quarry owned by the Kalkadoon tribe.,They traded them with their neighbors,for things like stingray barbs,,and the consequence was that stone axes,ended up over a large part of Australia.,So long-distance movement of tools,is a sign of trade, not migration. 
 What happens when you cut people off from exchange,,from the ability to exchange and specialize?,And the answer is that,not only do you slow down technological progress,,you can actually throw it into reverse.,An example is Tasmania.,When the sea level rose and Tasmania became an island 10,000 years ago,,the people on it not only experienced,slower progress than people on the mainland,,they actually experienced regress.,They gave up the ability to make stone tools,and fishing equipment and clothing,because the population of about 4,000 people,was simply not large enough,to maintain the specialized skills,necessary to keep the technology they had.,It's as if the people in this room were plonked on a desert island.,How many of the things in our pockets,could we continue to make after 10,000 years?,It didn't happen in Tierra del Fuego --,similar island, similar people.,The reason: because Tierra del Fuego,is separated from South America by a much narrower straight,,and there was trading contact across that straight,throughout 10,000 years.,The Tasmanians were isolated. 
 Go back to this image again,and ask yourself, not only who made it and for who,,but who knew how to make it.,In the case of the stone axe, the man who made it knew how to make it.,But who knows how to make a computer mouse?,Nobody, literally nobody.,There is nobody on the planet who knows how to make a computer mouse.,I mean this quite seriously.,The president of the computer mouse company doesn't know.,He just knows how to run a company.,The person on the assembly line doesn't know,because he doesn't know how to drill an oil well,to get oil out to make plastic, and so on.,We all know little bits, but none of us knows the whole. 
 I am of course quoting from a famous essay,by Leonard Read, the economist in the 1950s,,called "I, Pencil",in which he wrote about how a pencil came to be made,,and how nobody knows even how to make a pencil,,because the people who assemble it don't know how to mine graphite,,and they don't know how to fell trees and that kind of thing.,And what we've done in human society,,through exchange and specialization,,is we've created,the ability to do things that we don't even understand.,It's not the same with language.,With language we have to transfer ideas,that we understand with each other.,But with technology,,we can actually do things that are beyond our capabilities. 
 We've gone beyond the capacity of the human mind,to an extraordinary degree.,And by the way,,that's one of the reasons that I'm not interested,in the debate about I.Q.,,about whether some groups have higher I.Q.s than other groups.,It's completely irrelevant.,What's relevant to a society,is how well people are communicating their ideas,,and how well they're cooperating,,not how clever the individuals are.,So we've created something called the collective brain.,We're just the nodes in the network.,We're the neurons in this brain.,It's the interchange of ideas,,the meeting and mating of ideas between them,,that is causing technological progress,,incrementally, bit by bit.,However, bad things happen.,And in the future, as we go forward,,we will, of course, experience terrible things.,There will be wars; there will be depressions;,there will be natural disasters.,Awful things will happen in this century, I'm absolutely sure.,But I'm also sure that, because of the connections people are making,,and the ability of ideas,to meet and to mate,as never before,,I'm also sure,that technology will advance,,and therefore living standards will advance.,Because through the cloud,,through crowd sourcing,,through the bottom-up world that we've created,,where not just the elites but everybody,is able to have their ideas,and make them meet and mate,,we are surely accelerating the rate of innovation. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)In October 2010,,the Justice League of America will be teaming up with The 99.,Icons like Batman,,Superman, Wonder Woman and their colleagues,will be teaming up with icons Jabbar, Noora,,Jami and their colleagues.,It's a story of intercultural intersections,,and what better group,to have this conversation,than those that grew out of fighting fascism,in their respective histories and geographies?,As fascism took over Europe in the 1930s,,an unlikely reaction came out of North America.,As Christian iconography got changed,,and swastikas were created out of crucifixes,,Batman and Superman were created by Jewish young men,in the United States and Canada,,also going back to the Bible. 
 Consider this:,like the prophets, all the superheroes,are missing parents.,Superman's parents die on Krypton,before the age of one.,Bruce Wayne, who becomes Batman,,loses his parents at the age of six in Gotham City.,Spiderman is raised,by his aunt and uncle.,And all of them, just like the prophets who get their message,from God through Gabriel,,get their message from above.,Peter Parker is in a library in Manhattan,when the spider descends from above,and gives him his message through a bite.,Bruce Wayne is in his bedroom,when a big bat flies over his head,,and he sees it as an omen to become Batman.,Superman is not only sent to Earth,from the heavens, or Krypton,,but he's sent in a pod, much like Moses was on the Nile.,(Laughter),And you hear the voice of his father, Jor-El,,saying to Earth, "I have sent to you my only son." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 These are clearly biblical archetypes,,and the thinking behind that was to create,positive, globally-resonating storylines,that could be tied to the same things,that other people were pulling mean messages out of,because then the person that's using religion for the wrong purpose,just becomes a bad man with a bad message.,And it's only by linking positive things,that the negative can be delinked.,This is the kind of thinking that went into,creating The 99.,The 99 references the 99 attributes of Allah in the Koran,,things like generosity and mercy and foresight and wisdom,and dozens of others that no two people in the world would disagree about.,It doesn't matter what your religion is;,even if you're an atheist, you don't raise your kid telling him, you know,,"Make sure you lie three times a day.",Those are basic human values. 
 And so the backstory of The 99,takes place in 1258,,which history tells us the Mongols invaded Baghdad and destroyed it.,All the books from Bait al-Hikma library,,the most famous library in its day, were thrown in the Tigris River,,and the Tigris changes color with ink.,It's a story passed on generation after generation.,I rewrote that story,,and in my version, the librarians find out that this is going to happen --,and here's a side note:,if you want a comic book to do well, make the librarians the hero. It always works well.,(Laughter),(Applause),So the librarians find out,and they get together a special solution, a chemical solution called King's Water,,that when mixed with 99 stones,would be able to save all that culture and history in the books.,But the Mongols get there first.,The books and the solution get thrown in the Tigris River.,Some librarians escape, and over the course of days and weeks,,they dip the stones into the Tigris and suck up that collective wisdom,that we all think is lost to civilization. 
 Those stones have been smuggled as three prayer beads,of 33 stones each,through Arabia into Andalusia in Spain, where they're safe for 200 years.,But in 1492, two important things happen.,The first is the fall of Granada,,the last Muslim enclave in Europe.,The second is Columbus finally gets funded to go to India, but he gets lost.,(Laughter),So 33 of the stones are smuggled,onto the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria,and are spread in the New World.,Thirty-three go on the Silk Road to China, South Asia and Southeast Asia.,And 33 are spread between Europe, the Middle East and Africa. 
 And now it's 2010, and there are 99 heroes,from 99 different countries.,Now it's very easy to assume,that those books, because they were from a library called Bait al-Hikma, were Muslim books,,but that's not the case because the caliph that built that library,,his name was al-Ma'mun -- he was Harun al-Rashid's son.,He had told his advisers, "Get me all the scholars,to translate any book they can get their hands onto into Arabic,,and I will pay them its weight in gold.",After a while, his advisers complained.,They said, "Your Highness, the scholars are cheating.,They're writing in big handwriting to take more gold.",To which he said, "Let them be, because what they're giving us,is worth a lot more than what we're paying them.",So the idea of an open architecture, an open knowledge,,is not new to my neck of the desert. 
 The concept centers on something called the Noor stones.,Noor is Arabic for light.,So these 99 stones, a few kind of rules in the game:,Number one, you don't choose the stone; the stone chooses you.,There's a King Arthur element to the storyline, okay.,Number two, all of The 99,,when they first get their stone, or their power, abuse it;,they use it for self-interest.,And there's a very strong message in there that when you start abusing your stone,,you get taken advantage of,by people who will exploit your powers, okay.,Number three, the 99 stones all have within them,a mechanism that self-updates. 
 Now there are two groups that exist within the Muslim world.,Everybody believes the Koran is for all time and all place.,Some believe that means that the original interpretation,from a couple thousand years ago is what's relevant today.,I don't belong there.,Then there's a group that believes the Koran is a living, breathing document,,and I captured that idea within these stones that self-update.,Now the main bad guy, Rughal,,does not want these stones to update,,so he's trying to get them to stop updating.,He can't use the stones, but he can stop them.,And by stopping them, he has more of a fascist agenda,,where he gets some of The 99 to work for him --,they're all wearing cookie-cutter, same color uniforms,They're not allowed to individually express who they are and what they are.,And he controls them from the top down --,whereas when they work for the other side, eventually,,when they find out this is the wrong person, they've been manipulated,,they actually, each one has a different, colorful,kind of dress. 
 And the last point about the 99 Noor stones is this.,So The 99 work in teams of three.,Why three? A couple of reasons.,Number one, we have a thing within Islam that you don't leave a boy and a girl alone together,,because the third person is temptation or the devil, right?,I think that's there in all cultures, right?,But this is not about religion, it's not about proselytizing.,There's this very strong social message,that needs to get to kind of,the deepest crevices of intolerance,,and the only way to get there is to kind of play the game.,And so this is the way I dealt with it.,They work in teams of three: two boys and a girl, two girls and a boy,,three boys, three girls, no problem.,And the Swiss psychoanalyst, Carl Jung, also spoke about,the importance of the number three in all cultures, so I figure I'm covered.,Well ...,I got accused in a few blogs that I was actually sent by the Pope,to preach the Trinity and Catholicism in the Middle East,,so you -- (Laughter),you believe who you want. I gave you my version of the story. 
 So here's some of the characters that we have.,Mujiba, from Malaysia: her main power is she's able to answer any question.,She's the Trivial Pursuit queen, if you want,,but when she first gets her power,,she starts going on game shows and making money.,We have Jabbar from Saudi who starts breaking things when he has the power.,Now, Mumita was a fun one to name. Mumita is the destroyer.,So the 99 attributes of Allah have the yin and the yang;,there's the powerful, the hegemonous, the strong,,and there's also the kind, the generous.,I'm like, are all the girls going to be kind and merciful and the guys all strong?,I'm like, you know what, I've met a few girls who were destroyers in my lifetime, so ...,(Laughter),We have Jami from Hungary, who first starts making weapons:,He's the technology wiz.,Musawwira from Ghana,,Hadya from Pakistan, Jaleel from Iran who uses fire.,And this is one of my favorites, Al-Batina from Yemen.,Al-Batina is the hidden.,So Al-Batina is hidden, but she's a superhero.,I came home to my wife and I said, "I created a character after you.",My wife is a Saudi from Yemeni roots.,And she said, "Show me." So I showed this.,She said, "That's not me.",I said, "Look at the eyes. They're your eyes." 
 (Laughter) 
 So I promised my investors this would not be another made-in-fifth-world-country production.,This was going to be Superman, or it wasn't worth my time or their money.,So from day one, the people involved in the project,,bottom left is Fabian Nicieza,,writer for X-Men and Power Rangers.,Next to him is Dan Panosian,,one of the character creators for the modern-day X-Men.,Top right is Stuart Moore, a writer for Iron Man.,Next to him is John McCrea, who was an inker for Spiderman.,And we entered Western consciousness,with a tagline: "Next Ramadan, the world will have new heroes,",back in 2005. 
 Now I went to Dubai, to an Arab Thought Foundation Conference,,and I was waiting by the coffee for the right journalist.,Didn't have a product, but had energy.,And I found somebody from The New York Times,,and I cornered him, and I pitched him.,And I think I scared him -- (Laughter),because he basically promised me --,we had no product -- but he said, "We'll give you a paragraph in the arts section,if you'll just go away.",(Laughter),So I said, "Great." So I called him up a few weeks afterward.,I said, "Hi, Hesa." And he said, "Hi." I said, "Happy New Year.",He said, "Thank you. We had a baby." I said, "Congratulations.",Like I care, right?,"So when's the article coming out?",He said, "Naif, Islam and cartoon?,That's not timely.,You know, maybe next week, next month, next year, but, you know, it'll come out.",So a few days after that, what happens?,What happens is the world erupts in the Danish cartoon controversy.,I became timely.,(Laughter),So flurry of phone calls and emails from The New York Times.,Next thing you knew, there's a full page covering us positively,,January 22nd, 2006,,which changed our lives forever,,because anybody Googling Islam and cartoon or Islam and comic,,guess what they got; they got me. 
 And The 99 were like superheroes,kind of flying out of what was happening around the world.,And that led to all kinds of things,,from being in curricula in universities and schools to --,one of my favorite pictures I have from South Asia,,it was a couple of men with long beards,and a lot of girls wearing the hijab -- it looked like a school.,The good news is they're all holding copies of The 99, smiling,,and they found me to sign the picture.,The bad news is they were all photocopies, so we didn't make a dime in revenue.,(Laughter),We've been able to license The 99 comic books,into eight languages so far --,Chinese, Indonesian, Hindi, Urdu, Turkish.,Opened a theme park through a license in Kuwait a year and a half ago,called The 99 Village Theme Park --,300,000 square feet, 20 rides, all with our characters:,a couple back-to-school licenses in Spain and Turkey. 
 But the biggest thing we've done to date, which is just amazing,,is that we've done a 26-episode animated series,,which is done for global audiences:,in fact, we're already going to be in the U.S. and Turkey, we know.,It's 3D CGI, which is going to be very high-quality,,written in Hollywood by the writers behind Ben 10,and Spiderman and Star Wars: Clone Wars.,In this clip I'm about to show you, which has never been seen in the public before,,there is a struggle.,Two of the characters, Jabbar, the one with the muscles,,and Noora, the one that can use light,,are actually wearing the cookie-cutter fascist gray uniform,because they're being manipulated.,They don't know, OK,,and they're trying to get another member of The 99 to join them.,So there's a struggle within the team.,So if we can get the lights ... 
 ["The 99"] 
 Jabbar: Dana, I can't see where to grab hold.,I need more light. 
 What's happening? 
 Dana: There's too much darkness. 
 Rughal: There must be something we can do. 
 Man: I won't send any more commandos in,until I know it's safe. 
 Dr. Razem: It's time to go, Miklos. 
 Miklos: Must download file contents.,I can't forget auntie. 
 Jabbar: Dana, I can't do this without you. 
 Dana: But I can't help. 
 Jabbar: You can,,even if you don't believe in yourself right now.,I believe in you.,You are Noora the Light. 
 Dana: No.,I don't deserve it. I don't deserve anything. 
 Jabbar: Then what about the rest of us?,Don't we deserve to be saved? Don't I?,Now, tell me which way to go. 
 Dana: That way. 
 Alarm: Threat imminent. 
 Jabbar: Aaaahhh! 
 Miklos: Stay away from me. 
 Jabbar: We're here to help you. 
 Dr. Razem: Don't listen to them. 
 Dana: Miklos, that man is not your friend. 
 Miklos: No. He gave me access,,and you want to reboot the [unclear]. No more [unclear]. 
 ["The 99"] 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 So "The 99" is technology; it's entertainment;,it's design.,But that's only half the story.,As the father of five sons,,I worry about who they're going to be using as role models.,I worry because all around me, even within my extended family,,I see religion being manipulated.,As a psychologist, I worry,for the world in general,,but worry about the perception of how people see themselves,in my part of the world.,Now, I'm a clinical psychologist. I'm licensed in New York State.,I trained at Bellevue Hospital Survivors of Political Torture Program,,and I heard one too many stories of people growing up,to idolize their leadership,,only to end up being tortured by their heroes.,And torture's a terrible enough thing as it is, but when it's done by your hero,,that just breaks you in so many ways.,I left Bellevue, went to business school and started this. 
 Now, one of the things that I refer to,when I -- about the importance of this message --,is that I gave a lecture at the medical school at Kuwait University,,where I lecture on the biological basis of behavior,,and I gave the students two articles, one from The New York Times,and one from New York magazine.,And I took away the name of the writer, the name of the [unclear] -- everything was gone except the facts.,And the first one was about a group called The Party of God,,who wanted to ban Valentine's Day. Red was made illegal.,Any boys and girls caught flirting,would get married off immediately, okay.,The second one was about a woman complaining,because three minivans with six bearded men pulled up,and started interrogating her on the spot,for talking to a man who wasn't related to her. 
 And I asked the students in Kuwait where they thought these incidents took place.,The first one, they said Saudi Arabia. There was no debate.,The second one, they were actually split,between Saudi and Afghanistan.,What blew their mind was the first one took place in India,,it was the party of a Hindu God.,The second one took place in upstate New York.,It was an Orthodox Jewish community.,But what breaks my heart and what's alarming,is that in those two interviews,,the people around, who were interviewed as well,,refer to that behavior as Talibanization.,In other words, good Hindus and good Jews don't act this way.,This is Islam's influence on Hinduism and Judaism.,But what do the students in Kuwait say? They said it's us --,and this is dangerous.,It's dangerous when a group self-identifies itself,as extreme. 
 This is one of my sons, Rayan,,who's a Scooby Doo addict.,You can tell by the glasses there.,He actually called me a meddling kid the other day.,(Laughter),But I borrow a lesson that I learned from him.,Last summer when we were in our home in New York,,he was out in the yard playing in his playhouse. And I was in my office working,,and he came in, "Baba, I want you to come with me. I want my toy.","Yes, Rayan, just go away." He left his Scooby Doo in his house.,I said, "Go away. I'm working. I'm busy.",And what Rayan did then,is he sat there, he tapped his foot on the floor, at three and a half,,and he looked at me and he said, "Baba,,I want you to come with me to my office in my house.,I have work to do.",(Laughter),(Applause),Rayan reframed the situation,and brought himself down to my level. 
 (Laughter) 
 And with The 99, that is what we aim to do.,You know, I think that there's a big parallel,between bending the crucifix out of shape,and creating swastikas.,And when I see pictures like this, of parents or uncles,who think it's cute to have a little child,holding a Koran and having a suicide bomber belt around them,to protest something,,the hope is by linking enough positive things,to the Koran,,that one day we can move this child,from being proud in the way they're proud there,,to that.,And I think --,I think The 99,can and will achieve its mission. 
 As an undergrad at Tufts University, we were giving away free falafel one day,and, you know, it was Middle East Day or something.,And people came up and picked up,the culturally resonant image of the falafel,,ate it and, you know, talked and left.,And no two people could disagree about what the word free was,and what the word falafel was, behind us, "free falafel." You know.,(Laughter),Or so we thought,,until a woman came rushing across the campus,and dropped her bag on the floor, pointed up to the sign and said,,"Who's falafel?",(Laughter),True story.,(Laughter),She was actually coming out of an Amnesty International meeting. 
 (Laughter) 
 Just today, D.C. Comics announced,the cover of our upcoming crossover.,On that cover you see Batman, Superman,and a fully-clothed Wonder Woman,with our Saudi member of The 99,,our Emirati member and our Libyan member.,On April 26, 2010,,President Barack Obama said that,of all the initiatives since his now famous Cairo speech --,in which he reached out to the Muslim world --,the most innovative was that The 99 reach back out,to the Justice League of America.,We live in a world in which the most culturally innocuous symbols,,like the falafel, can be misunderstood because of baggage,,and where religion can be twisted,and purposefully made where it's not supposed to be by others.,In a world like that,,they'll always be a job for Superman and The 99. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I learned about the Haiti earthquake by Skype.,My wife sent me a message,,"Whoa, earthquake,",and then disappeared for 25 minutes.,It was 25 minutes of absolute terror,that thousands of people across the U.S. felt.,I was afraid of a tsunami;,what I didn't realize,was there was a greater terror in Haiti,,and that was building collapse.,We've all seen the photos,of the collapsed buildings in Haiti.,These are shots my wife took,a couple days after the quake,,while I was making my way through the D.R. into the country.,This is the national palace --,the equivalent of the White House.,This is the largest supermarket in the Caribbean,at peak shopping time.,This is a nurses' college --,there are 300 nurses studying.,The general hospital right next door,emerged largely unscathed.,This is the Ministry of Economics and Finance. 
 We have all heard,about the tremendous human loss,in the earthquake in Haiti,,but we haven't heard enough,about why all those lives were lost.,We haven't heard about,why the buildings failed.,After all, it was the buildings,,not the earthquake,,that killed 220,000 people,,that injured 330,000,,that displaced 1.3 million people,,that cut off food,and water and supplies,for an entire nation.,This is the largest metropolitan-area disaster,in decades,,and it was not a natural disaster --,it was a disaster of engineering. 
 AIDG has worked in Haiti,since 2007,,providing engineering and business support,to small businesses.,And after the quake, we started bringing in earthquake engineers,to figure out why the buildings collapsed,,to examine what was safe and what wasn't.,Working with MINUSTAH,,which is the U.N. mission in Haiti,,with the Ministry of Public Works,,with different NGOs,,we inspected over 1,500 buildings.,We inspected schools,and private residencies.,We inspected medical centers,and food warehouses.,We inspected government buildings. 
 This is the Ministry of Justice.,Behind that door,is the National Judicial Archives.,The fellow in the door, Andre Filitrault --,who's the director,of the Center for Interdisciplinary Earthquake Engineering Research,at the University of Buffalo --,was examining it to see if it was safe,to recover the archives.,Andre told me,,after seeing these buildings fail,again and again in the same way,,that there is no new research here.,There is nothing here that we don't know.,The failure points were the same:,walls and slabs not tied properly into columns --,that's a roof slab hanging off the building --,cantilevered structures,,or structures that were asymmetric,,that shook violently and came down,,poor building materials,,not enough concrete,,not enough compression in the blocks,,rebar that was smooth,,rebar that was exposed to the weather and had rusted away. 
 Now there's a solution,to all these problems.,And we know how to build properly.,The proof of this came in Chile,,almost a month later,,when 8.8 magnitude earthquake,hit Chile.,That is 500 times,the power of the 7.0,that hit Port-au-Prince --,500 times the power,,yet only under a thousand casualties.,Adjusted for population density,,that is less than one percent,of the impact of the Haitian quake.,What was the difference,between Chile and Haiti?,Seismic standards,and confined masonry,,where the building acts as a whole --,walls and columns,and roofs and slabs,tied together to support each other --,instead of breaking off into separate members and failing.,If you look at this building in Chile,,it's ripped in half,,but it's not a pile of rubble.,Chileans have been building with confined masonry,for decades. 
 Right now, AIDG is working with KPFF Consulting Engineers,,Architecture for Humanity,,to bring more confined masonry training,into Haiti.,This is Xantus Daniel;,he's a mason,,just a general construction worker, not a foreman,,who took one of our trainings.,On his last job he was working with his boss,,and they started pouring the columns wrong.,He took his boss aside,,and he showed him the materials on confined masonry.,He showed him, "You know, we don't have to do this wrong.,It won't cost us any more,to do it the right way.",And they redid that building.,They tied the rebar right,,they poured the columns right,,and that building will be safe.,And every building,that they build going forward,will be safe. 
 To make sure these buildings are safe,,it's not going to take policy --,it's going to take reaching out,to the masons on the ground,and helping them learn the proper techniques.,Now there are many groups doing this.,And the fellow in the vest there,,Craig Toten,,he has pushed forward,to get documentation out to all the groups that are doing this.,Through Haiti Rewired,,through Build Change, Architecture for Humanity,,AIDG,,there is the possibility,to reach out,to 30,000 -- 40,000 masons,across the country,and create a movement of proper building.,If you reach out to the people on the ground,in this collaborative way,it's extremely affordable.,For the billions spent on reconstruction,,you can train masons,for dollars on every house,that they end up building over their lifetime. 
 Ultimately, there are two ways,that you can rebuild Haiti;,the way at the top,is the way that Haiti's been building for decades.,The way at the top,is a poorly constructed building,that will fail.,The way at the bottom is a confined masonry building,,where the walls are tied together,,the building is symmetric,,and it will stand up to an earthquake.,For all the disaster,,there is an opportunity here,to build better houses,for the next generation,,so that when the next earthquake hits,,it is a disaster --,but not a tragedy. 
 (Applause)So there are a few things,that bring us humans together in the way that an election does.,We stand in elections; we vote in elections;,we observe elections.,Our democracies rely on elections.,We all understand why we have elections,,and we all leave the house on the same day,to go and vote.,We cherish the opportunity to have our say,,to help decide the future of the country.,The fundamental idea is that politicians,are given mandate to speak for us,,to make decisions on our behalf,that affect us all.,Without that mandate, they would be corrupt. 
 Well unfortunately, power corrupts,,and so people will do lots of things,to get power and to stay in power,,including doing bad things to elections.,You see, even if the idea,of the election is perfect,,running a countrywide election is a big project,,and big projects are messy.,Whenever there is an election,,it seems like something always goes wrong,,someone tries to cheat,,or something goes accidentally awry --,a ballot box goes missing here,,chads are left hanging over here. 
 To make sure as few things as possible go wrong,,we have all these procedures around the election.,So for example, you come to the polling station,,and a poll station worker asks for your ID,before giving you a ballot form,and asking you to go into a voting booth,to fill out your vote.,When you come back out, you get to drop your vote,into the ballot box,where it mixes with all the other votes,,so that no one knows how you voted. 
 Well, what I want us to think about for a moment,is what happens after that,,after you drop your vote into the ballot box.,And most people would go home,and feel sure that their vote has been counted,,because they trust,that the election system works.,They trust that election workers and election observers,do their jobs and do their jobs correctly.,The ballot boxes go to counting places.,They're unsealed and the votes are poured out,and laboriously counted.,Most of us have to trust,that that happens correctly for our own vote,,and we all have to trust that that happens correctly,for all the votes in the election.,So we have to trust a lot of people.,We have to trust a lot of procedures.,And sometimes we even have to trust computers.,So imagine hundreds of millions of voters,casting hundreds of millions of votes,,all to be counted correctly,and all the things that can possibly go wrong,causing all these bad headlines,,and you cannot help but feel exhausted at the idea,of trying to make elections better. 
 Well in the face of all these bad headlines,,researchers have taken a step back,and thought about how we can do elections differently.,They've zoomed out and looked at the big picture.,And the big picture is this:,elections should be verifiable.,Voters should be able to check,that their votes are counted correctly,,without breaking election secrecy,,which is so very important.,And that's the tough part.,How do we make an election system completely verifiable,while keeping the votes,absolutely secret? 
 Well, the way we've come up with,uses computers,but doesn't depend on them.,And the secret is the ballot form.,And if you look closely at these ballot forms,,you'll notice that the candidate list,is in a different order on each one.,And that means, if you mark your choices on one of them,and then remove the candidate list,,I won't be able to tell from the bit remaining,what your vote is for.,And on each ballot form there is this encrypted value,in the form of this 2D barcode,on the right.,And there's some complicated cryptography,going on in there,,but what's not complicated,is voting with one of these forms.,So we can let computers do all the complicated cryptography for us,,and then we'll use the paper for verification. 
 So this is how you vote.,You get one of these ballot forms at random,,and then you go into the voting booth,,and you mark your choices,,and you tear along a perforation.,And you shred the candidate list.,And the bit that remains, the one with your marks --,this is your encrypted vote.,So you let a poll station worker,scan your encrypted vote.,And because it's encrypted,,it can be submitted, stored,and counted centrally,and displayed on a website,for anyone to see, including you.,So you take this encrypted vote,home as your receipt.,And after the close of the election,,you can check that your vote was counted,by comparing your receipt,to the vote on the website.,And remember, the vote is encrypted,from the moment you leave the voting booth,,so if an election official wants to find out how you voted,,they will not be able to.,If the government wants to find out how you voted,,they won't be able to.,No hacker can break in,and find out how you voted.,No hacker can break in and change your vote,,because then it won't match your receipt.,Votes can't go missing,because then you won't find yours when you look for it. 
 But the election magic doesn't stop there.,Instead, we want to make the whole process,so transparent,that news media and international observers,and anyone who wants to,can download all the election data,and do the count themselves.,They can check that all the votes were counted correctly.,They can check,that the announced result of the election,is the correct one.,And these are elections,by the people, for the people.,So the next step for our democracies,are transparent,and verifiable elections. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm a storyteller.,That's what I do in life -- telling stories,,writing novels --,and today I would like to tell you a few stories,about the art of storytelling,and also some supernatural creatures,called the djinni.,But before I go there, please allow me to share with you,glimpses of my personal story.,I will do so with the help of words, of course,,but also a geometrical shape, the circle,,so throughout my talk,,you will come across several circles. 
 I was born in Strasbourg, France,to Turkish parents.,Shortly after, my parents got separated,,and I came to Turkey with my mom.,From then on, I was raised,as a single child by a single mother.,Now in the early 1970s, in Ankara,,that was a bit unusual.,Our neighborhood was full of large families,,where fathers were the heads of households,,so I grew up seeing my mother as a divorcee,in a patriarchal environment.,In fact, I grew up observing,two different kinds of womanhood.,On the one hand was my mother,,a well-educated, secular, modern, westernized, Turkish woman.,On the other hand was my grandmother,,who also took care of me,and was more spiritual, less educated,and definitely less rational.,This was a woman who read coffee grounds to see the future,and melted lead into mysterious shapes,to fend off the evil eye. 
 Many people visited my grandmother,,people with severe acne on their faces,or warts on their hands.,Each time, my grandmother would utter some words in Arabic,,take a red apple and stab it,with as many rose thorns,as the number of warts she wanted to remove.,Then one by one, she would,encircle these thorns with dark ink.,A week later, the patient would come back,for a follow-up examination.,Now, I'm aware that I should not be saying such things,in front of an audience of scholars and scientists,,but the truth is, of all the people,who visited my grandmother for their skin conditions,,I did not see anyone go back,unhappy or unhealed.,I asked her how she did this. Was it the power of praying?,In response she said, "Yes, praying is effective,,but also beware of the power of circles." 
 From her, I learned, amongst many other things,,one very precious lesson --,that if you want to destroy something in this life,,be it an acne, a blemish,or the human soul,,all you need to do is to surround it with thick walls.,It will dry up inside.,Now we all live in some kind of a social and cultural circle.,We all do.,We're born into a certain family, nation, class.,But if we have no connection whatsoever,with the worlds beyond the one we take for granted,,then we too run the risk,of drying up inside.,Our imagination might shrink;,our hearts might dwindle,,and our humanness might wither,if we stay for too long,inside our cultural cocoons.,Our friends, neighbors, colleagues, family --,if all the people in our inner circle resemble us,,it means we are surrounded,with our mirror image. 
 Now one other thing women like my grandma do in Turkey,is to cover mirrors with velvet,or to hang them on the walls with their backs facing out.,It's an old Eastern tradition,based on the knowledge that it's not healthy,for a human being to spend too much time,staring at his own reflection.,Ironically, [living in] communities of the like-minded,is one of the greatest dangers,of today's globalized world.,And it's happening everywhere,,among liberals and conservatives,,agnostics and believers, the rich and the poor,,East and West alike.,We tend to form clusters,based on similarity,,and then we produce stereotypes,about other clusters of people.,In my opinion, one way of transcending,these cultural ghettos,is through the art of storytelling.,Stories cannot demolish frontiers,,but they can punch holes in our mental walls.,And through those holes, we can get a glimpse of the other,,and sometimes even like what we see. 
 I started writing fiction at the age of eight.,My mother came home one day with a turquoise notebook,and asked me if I'd be interested in keeping a personal journal.,In retrospect, I think she was slightly worried,about my sanity.,I was constantly telling stories at home, which was good,,except I told this to imaginary friends around me,,which was not so good.,I was an introverted child,,to the point of communicating with colored crayons,and apologizing to objects,when I bumped into them,,so my mother thought it might do me good,to write down my day-to-day experiences,and emotions.,What she didn't know was that I thought my life was terribly boring,,and the last thing I wanted to do,was to write about myself.,Instead, I began to write about people other than me,and things that never really happened.,And thus began my life-long passion,for writing fiction.,So from the very beginning, fiction for me,was less of an autobiographical manifestation,than a transcendental journey,into other lives, other possibilities.,And please bear with me:,I'll draw a circle and come back to this point. 
 Now one other thing happened around this same time.,My mother became a diplomat.,So from this small, superstitious,,middle-class neighborhood of my grandmother,,I was zoomed into this,posh, international school [in Madrid],,where I was the only Turk.,It was here that I had my first encounter,with what I call the "representative foreigner.",In our classroom, there were children from all nationalities,,yet this diversity did not necessarily lead,to a cosmopolitan, egalitarian,classroom democracy.,Instead, it generated an atmosphere,in which each child was seen --,not as an individual on his own,,but as the representative of something larger.,We were like a miniature United Nations, which was fun,,except whenever something negative,,with regards to a nation,or a religion, took place.,The child who represented it was mocked,,ridiculed and bullied endlessly.,And I should know, because during the time I attended that school,,a military takeover happened in my country,,a gunman of my nationality nearly killed the Pope,,and Turkey got zero points in [the] Eurovision Song Contest.,(Laughter) 
 I skipped school often and dreamed of becoming a sailor,during those days.,I also had my first taste,of cultural stereotypes there.,The other children asked me about the movie,"Midnight Express," which I had not seen;,they inquired how many cigarettes a day I smoked,,because they thought all Turks were heavy smokers,,and they wondered at what age,I would start covering my hair.,I came to learn that these were,the three main stereotypes about my country:,politics, cigarettes,and the veil.,After Spain, we went to Jordan, Germany,and Ankara again.,Everywhere I went, I felt like,my imagination was the only suitcase,I could take with me.,Stories gave me a sense of center,,continuity and coherence,,the three big Cs that I otherwise lacked. 
 In my mid-twenties, I moved to Istanbul,,the city I adore.,I lived in a very vibrant, diverse neighborhood,where I wrote several of my novels.,I was in Istanbul when the earthquake hit,in 1999.,When I ran out of the building at three in the morning,,I saw something that stopped me in my tracks.,There was the local grocer there --,a grumpy, old man who didn't sell alcohol,and didn't speak to marginals.,He was sitting next to a transvestite,with a long black wig,and mascara running down her cheeks.,I watched the man open a pack of cigarettes,with trembling hands,and offer one to her,,and that is the image of the night of the earthquake,in my mind today --,a conservative grocer and a crying transvestite,smoking together on the sidewalk.,In the face of death and destruction,,our mundane differences evaporated,,and we all became one,even if for a few hours.,But I've always believed that stories, too, have a similar effect on us.,I'm not saying that fiction has the magnitude of an earthquake,,but when we are reading a good novel,,we leave our small, cozy apartments behind,,go out into the night alone,and start getting to know people we had never met before,and perhaps had even been biased against. 
 Shortly after, I went,to a women's college in Boston, then Michigan.,I experienced this, not so much as a geographical shift,,as a linguistic one.,I started writing fiction in English.,I'm not an immigrant, refugee or exile --,they ask me why I do this --,but the commute between languages,gives me the chance to recreate myself.,I love writing in Turkish,,which to me is very poetic and very emotional,,and I love writing in English, which to me,is very mathematical and cerebral.,So I feel connected to each language in a different way.,For me, like millions of other people,around the world today,,English is an acquired language.,When you're a latecomer to a language,,what happens is you live there,with a continuous,and perpetual frustration.,As latecomers, we always want to say more, you know,,crack better jokes, say better things,,but we end up saying less,because there's a gap between the mind and the tongue.,And that gap is very intimidating.,But if we manage not to be frightened by it,,it's also stimulating.,And this is what I discovered in Boston --,that frustration was very stimulating. 
 At this stage, my grandmother,,who had been watching the course of my life,with increasing anxiety,,started to include in her daily prayers,that I urgently get married,so that I could settle down once and for all.,And because God loves her, I did get married.,(Laughter),But instead of settling down,,I went to Arizona.,And since my husband is in Istanbul,,I started commuting between Arizona and Istanbul --,the two places on the surface of earth,that couldn't be more different.,I guess one part of me has always been a nomad,,physically and spiritually.,Stories accompany me,,keeping my pieces and memories together,,like an existential glue. 
 Yet as much as I love stories,,recently, I've also begun to think,that they lose their magic,if and when a story is seen as more than a story.,And this is a subject that I would love,to think about together.,When my first novel written in English came out in America,,I heard an interesting remark from a literary critic.,"I liked your book," he said, "but I wish you had written it differently.",(Laughter),I asked him what he meant by that.,He said, "Well, look at it. There's so many,Spanish, American, Hispanic characters in it,,but there's only one Turkish character and it's a man.",Now the novel took place on a university campus in Boston,,so to me, it was normal,that there be more international characters in it,than Turkish characters,,but I understood what my critic was looking for.,And I also understood that I,would keep disappointing him.,He wanted to see the manifestation of my identity.,He was looking for a Turkish woman in the book,because I happened to be one. 
 We often talk about how stories change the world,,but we should also see how the world of identity politics,affects the way stories,are being circulated,,read and reviewed.,Many authors feel this pressure,,but non-Western authors feel it more heavily.,If you're a woman writer from the Muslim world, like me,,then you are expected to write,the stories of Muslim women,and, preferably, the unhappy stories,of unhappy Muslim women.,You're expected to write,informative, poignant and characteristic stories,and leave the experimental and avant-garde,to your Western colleagues.,What I experienced as a child in that school in Madrid,is happening in the literary world today.,Writers are not seen,as creative individuals on their own,,but as the representatives,of their respective cultures:,a few authors from China, a few from Turkey,,a few from Nigeria.,We're all thought to have something very distinctive,,if not peculiar. 
 The writer and commuter James Baldwin,gave an interview in 1984,in which he was repeatedly asked about his homosexuality.,When the interviewer tried to pigeonhole him,as a gay writer,,Baldwin stopped and said,,"But don't you see? There's nothing in me,that is not in everybody else,,and nothing in everybody else,that is not in me.",When identity politics tries to put labels on us,,it is our freedom of imagination that is in danger.,There's a fuzzy category called,multicultural literature,in which all authors from outside the Western world,are lumped together.,I never forget my first multicultural reading,,in Harvard Square about 10 years ago.,We were three writers, one from the Philippines,,one Turkish and one Indonesian --,like a joke, you know.,(Laughter),And the reason why we were brought together,was not because we shared an artistic style,or a literary taste.,It was only because of our passports.,Multicultural writers are expected to tell real stories,,not so much the imaginary.,A function is attributed to fiction.,In this way, not only the writers themselves,,but also their fictional characters,become the representatives of something larger. 
 But I must quickly add,that this tendency to see a story,as more than a story,does not solely come from the West.,It comes from everywhere.,And I experienced this firsthand,when I was put on trial in 2005,for the words my fictional characters uttered in a novel.,I had intended to write,a constructive, multi-layered novel,about an Armenian and a Turkish family,through the eyes of women.,My micro story became a macro issue,when I was prosecuted.,Some people criticized, others praised me,for writing about the Turkish-Armenian conflict.,But there were times when I wanted to remind both sides,that this was fiction.,It was just a story.,And when I say, "just a story,",I'm not trying to belittle my work.,I want to love and celebrate fiction,for what it is,,not as a means to an end. 
 Writers are entitled to their political opinions,,and there are good political novels out there,,but the language of fiction,is not the language of daily politics.,Chekhov said,,"The solution to a problem,and the correct way of posing the question,are two completely separate things.,And only the latter is an artist's responsibility.",Identity politics divides us. Fiction connects.,One is interested in sweeping generalizations.,The other, in nuances.,One draws boundaries.,The other recognizes no frontiers.,Identity politics is made of solid bricks.,Fiction is flowing water. 
 In the Ottoman times, there were itinerant storytellers called "meddah.",They would go to coffee houses,,where they would tell a story in front of an audience,,often improvising.,With each new person in the story,,the meddah would change his voice,,impersonating that character.,Everybody could go and listen, you know --,ordinary people, even the sultan, Muslims and non-Muslims.,Stories cut across all boundaries,,like "The Tales of Nasreddin Hodja,",which were very popular throughout the Middle East,,North Africa, the Balkans and Asia.,Today, stories continue,to transcend borders.,When Palestinian and Israeli politicians talk,,they usually don't listen to each other,,but a Palestinian reader,still reads a novel by a Jewish author,,and vice versa, connecting and empathizing,with the narrator.,Literature has to take us beyond.,If it cannot take us there,,it is not good literature. 
 Books have saved the introverted,,timid child that I was -- that I once was.,But I'm also aware of the danger,of fetishizing them.,When the poet and mystic, Rumi,,met his spiritual companion, Shams of Tabriz,,one of the first things the latter did,was to toss Rumi's books into water,and watch the letters dissolve.,The Sufis say, "Knowledge that takes you not beyond yourself,is far worse than ignorance.",The problem with today's cultural ghettos,is not lack of knowledge --,we know a lot about each other, or so we think --,but knowledge that takes us not beyond ourselves:,it makes us elitist,,distant and disconnected.,There's a metaphor which I love:,living like a drawing compass.,As you know, one leg of the compass is static, rooted in a place.,Meanwhile, the other leg,draws a wide circle, constantly moving.,Like that, my fiction as well.,One part of it is rooted in Istanbul,,with strong Turkish roots,,but the other part travels the world,,connecting to different cultures.,In that sense, I like to think of my fiction,as both local and universal,,both from here and everywhere. 
 Now those of you who have been to Istanbul,have probably seen Topkapi Palace,,which was the residence of Ottoman sultans,for more than 400 years.,In the palace, just outside the quarters,of the favorite concubines,,there's an area called The Gathering Place of the Djinn.,It's between buildings.,I'm intrigued by this concept.,We usually distrust those areas,that fall in between things.,We see them as the domain,of supernatural creatures like the djinn,,who are made of smokeless fire,and are the symbol of elusiveness.,But my point is perhaps,that elusive space,is what writers and artists need most.,When I write fiction,I cherish elusiveness and changeability.,I like not knowing what will happen 10 pages later.,I like it when my characters surprise me.,I might write about,a Muslim woman in one novel,,and perhaps it will be a very happy story,,and in my next book, I might write,about a handsome, gay professor in Norway.,As long as it comes from our hearts,,we can write about anything and everything. 
 Audre Lorde once said,,"The white fathers taught us to say,,'I think, therefore I am.'",She suggested, "I feel, therefore I am free.",I think it was a wonderful paradigm shift.,And yet, why is it that,,in creative writing courses today,,the very first thing we teach students is,"write what you know"?,Perhaps that's not the right way to start at all.,Imaginative literature is not necessarily about,writing who we are or what we know,or what our identity is about.,We should teach young people and ourselves,to expand our hearts,and write what we can feel.,We should get out of our cultural ghetto,and go visit the next one and the next. 
 In the end, stories move like whirling dervishes,,drawing circles beyond circles.,They connect all humanity,,regardless of identity politics,,and that is the good news.,And I would like to finish with an old Sufi poem:,"Come, let us be friends for once;,let us make life easy on us;,let us be lovers and loved ones;,the earth shall be left to no one." 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm an American, which means, generally,,I ignore football unless it involves,guys my size or Bruno's size,running into each other at extremely high speeds.,That said, it's been really hard,to ignore football,for the last couple of weeks.,I go onto Twitter, there are all these strange words that I've never heard before:,FIFA, vuvuzela,,weird jokes about octopi.,But the one that's really been sort of stressing me out,,that I haven't been able to figure out,,is this phrase "Cala a boca, Galvao.",If you've gone onto Twitter in the last couple of weeks,,you've probably seen this.,It's been a major trending topic. 
 Being a monolingual American, I obviously don't know what the phrase means.,So I went onto Twitter,,and I asked some people if they could explain to me "Cala a boca, Galvao.",And fortunately, my Brazilian friends,were more than ready to help.,They explained that the Galvao bird,is a rare and endangered parrot,that's in terrible, terrible danger.,In fact, I'll let them tell you a bit more about it.,Narrator: A word about Galvao, a very rare kind of bird,native to Brazil.,Every year, more than 300,000 Galvao birds,are killed during Carnival parades.,Ethan Zuckerman: Obviously, this is a tragic situation,,and it actually gets worse.,It turns out that, not only is the Galvao parrot,very attractive, useful for headdresses,,it evidently has certain hallucinogenic properties,,which means that there's a terrible problem,with Galvao abuse.,Some sick and twisted people have found themselves snorting Galvao.,And it's terribly endangered.,The good news about this is that the global community --,again, my Brazilian friends tell me --,is pitching in to help out.,It turns out that Lady Gaga,has released a new single --,actually five or six new singles, as near as I can tell --,titled "Cala a boca, Galvao.",And my Brazilian friends tell me that,if I just tweet the phrase "Cala a boca, Galvao,",10 cents will be given,to a global campaign,to save this rare and beautiful bird. 
 Now, most of you have figured out that this was a prank,,and actually a very, very good one.,"Cala a boca, Galvao" actually means something very different.,In Portugese, it means "Shut your mouth, Galvao.",And it specifically refers to this guy, Galvao Bueno,,who's the lead soccer commentator,for Rede Globo.,And what I understand from my Brazilian friends,is that this guy is just a cliche machine.,He can ruin the most interesting match,by just spouting cliche again and again and again.,So Brazilians went to that first match,against North Korea,,put up this banner, started a Twitter campaign,and tried to convince the rest of us,to tweet the phrase: "Cala a boca, Galvao.",And in fact, were so successful at this,that it topped Twitter for two weeks. 
 Now there's a couple --,there's a couple of lessons that you can take from this.,And the first lesson, which I think is a worthwhile one,,is that you cannot go wrong,asking people to be active online,,so long as activism just means retweeting a phrase.,So as long as activism is that simple,,it's pretty easy to get away with.,The other thing you can take from this, by the way,,is that there are a lot of Brazilians on Twitter.,There's more than five million of them.,As far as national representation,,11 percent of Brazilian internet users are on Twitter.,That's a much higher number than in the U.S. or U.K.,Next to Japan,,it's the second most represented by population. 
 Now if you're using Twitter or other social networks,,and you didn't realize,this was a space with a lot of Brazilians in it,,you're like most of us.,Because what happens on a social network,is you interact with the people,that you have chosen to interact with.,And if you are like me, a big, geeky, white, American guy,,you tend to interact with a lot of other geeky, white, American guys.,And you don't necessarily have the sense,that Twitter is in fact a very heavily Brazilian space.,It's also extremely surprising to many Americans,,a heavily African-American space.,Twitter recently did some research.,They looked at their local population.,They believe that 24 percent,of American Twitter users are African-American.,That's about twice as high as African-Americans,are represented in the population.,And again, that was very shocking to many Twitter users,,but it shouldn't be.,And the reason it shouldn't be is that on any day,you can go into Trending Topics.,And you tend to find topics,that are almost entirely African-American conversations. 
 This was a visualization done by Fernando Viegas,and Martin Wattenberg,,two amazing visualization designers,,who looked at,a weekend's worth of Twitter traffic,and essentially found that a lot of these trending topics,were basically segregated conversations --,and in ways that you wouldn't expect.,It turns out that oil spill is a mostly white conversation,,that cookout,is a mostly black conversation.,And what's crazy about this is that,if you wanted to mix up who you were seeing on Twitter,,it's literally a quick click away.,You click on that cookout tag, there an entirely different conversation,with different people participating in it.,But generally speaking, most of us don't.,We end up within these filter bubbles, as my friend Eli Pariser calls them,,where we see the people we already know,and the people who are similar to the people we already know.,And we tend not to see that wider picture. 
 Now for me, I'm surprised by this,,because this wasn't how the internet was supposed to be.,If you go back into the early days of the internet,,when cyber-utopians like Nick Negroponte,were writing big books like "Being Digital,",the prediction was that the internet,was going to be an incredibly powerful force,to smooth out cultural differences,,to put us all on a common field of one fashion or another.,Negroponte started his book with a story,about how hard it is to build connections,in the world of atoms.,He's at a technology conference in Florida.,And he's looking at something really, truly absurd,,which is bottles of Evian water on the table.,And Negroponte says this is crazy.,This is the old economy.,It's the economy of moving these,heavy, slow atoms over long distances that's very difficult to do.,We're heading to the future of bits,,where everything is speedy, it's weightless.,It can be anywhere in the world at any time.,And it's going to change the world as we know it. 
 Now, Negroponte has been right about a lot of things.,He's totally wrong about this one.,It turns out that in many cases,atoms are much more mobile than bits.,If I walk into a store in the United States,,it's very, very easy for me to buy water,that's bottled in Fiji,,shipped at great expense to the United States.,It's actually surprisingly hard,for me to see a Fijian feature film.,It's really difficult for me to listen to Fijian music.,It's extremely difficult for me to get Fijian news,,which is strange, because actually there's an enormous amount going on in Fiji.,There's a coup government. There's a military government.,There's crackdowns on the press.,It's actually a place that we probably should,be paying attention to at the moment. 
 Here's what I think is going on.,I think that we tend to look a lot,at the infrastructure,of globalization.,We look at the framework that makes it possible,to live in this connected world.,And that's a framework that includes things like airline routes.,It includes things like the Internet cables.,We look at a map like this one,,and it looks like the entire world is flat,because everything is a hop or two away.,You can get on a flight in London,,you can end up in Bangalore later today.,Two hops, you're in Suva, the capitol of Fiji.,It's all right there. 
 When you start looking at what actually,flows on top of these networks,,you get a very different picture.,You start looking at how,the global plane flights move,,and you suddenly discover that the world isn't even close to flat.,It's extremely lumpy.,There are parts of the world that are very, very well connected.,There's basically a giant pathway in the sky,between London and New York.,but look at this map, and you can watch this,for, you know, two or three minutes.,You won't see very many planes,go from South America to Africa.,And you'll discover that there are parts of the globe,that are systematically cut off.,When we stop looking at the infrastructure that makes connection possible,,and we look at what actually happens,,we start realizing that the world doesn't work quite the same way,that we think it does. 
 So here's the problem that I've been interested in,in the last decade or so.,The world is, in fact, getting more global.,It's getting more connected.,More of problems are global in scale.,More of our economics is global in scale.,And our media is less global by the day.,If you watched a television broadcast in the United States in the 1970s,,35 to 40 percent of it would have been international news,on a nightly new broadcast.,That's down to about 12 to 15 percent.,And this tends to give us a very distorted view of the world.,Here's a slide that Alisa Miller showed at a previous TED Talk.,Alisa's the president of Public Radio International.,And she made a cartogram, which is basically a distorted map,based on what American,television news casts,looked at for a month.,And you see that when you distort a map based on attention,,the world within American television news,is basically reduced to,this giant bloated U.S.,and a couple of other countries which we've invaded.,And that's basically what our media is about.,And before you conclude that this is just a function of American TV news --,which is dreadful, and I agree that it's dreadful --,I've been mapping elite media like the New York Times,,and I get the same thing.,When you look at the New York Times, you look at other elite media,,what you largely get are pictures of very wealthy nations,and the nations we've invaded. 
 It turns out that new media,isn't necessarily helping us all that much.,Here's a map made by Mark Graham,who's down the street at the Oxford Internet Institute.,A this is a map of articles in Wikipedia,that have been geo-coded.,And you'll notice that there's a very heavy bias,towards North America and Western Europe.,Even within Wikipedias,,where we're creating their own content online,,there's a heavy bias towards the place where,a lot of the Wikipedia authors are based,,rather than to the rest of the world.,In the U.K., you can get up,,you can pick up your computer when you get out of this session,,you could read a newspaper from India or from Australia,,from Canada, God forbid from the U.S.,You probably won't.,If you look at online media consumption --,in this case, in the top 10 users of the internet --,more than 95 percent of the news readership,is on domestic news sites.,It's one of these rare cases where the U.S. is actually slightly better than [the U.K.],,because we actually like reading your media,,rather than vice versa. 
 So all of this starts leading me,to think that we're in a state that I refer to,as imaginary cosmopolitanism.,We look at the internet.,We think we're getting this wide view of the globe.,We occasionally stumble onto a page in Chinese,,and we decide that we do in fact have the greatest technology ever built,to connect us to the rest of the world.,And we forget that most of the time,we're checking Boston Red Sox scores.,So this is a real problem --,not just because the Red Sox are having a bad year --,but it's a real problem because,,as we're discussing here at TED,,the real problems in the world,the interesting problems to solve,are global in scale and scope,,they require global conversations,to get to global solutions.,This is a problem we have to solve. 
 So here's the good news.,For six years, I've been hanging out with these guys.,This is a group called Global Voices.,This is a team of bloggers from around the world.,Our mission was to fix the world's media.,We started in 2004.,You might have noticed, we haven't done all that well so far.,Nor do I think we are by ourselves,,actually going to solve the problem.,But the more that I think about it, the more that I think,that a few things that we have learned along the way,are interesting lessons for how we would rewire,if we we wanted to use the web to have a wider world.,The first thing you have to consider,is that there are parts of the world,that are dark spots in terms of attention.,In this case -- the map of the world at night by NASA --,they're dark literally because of lack of electricity.,And I used to think that a dark spot on this map,basically meant you're not going to get media from there,because there are more basic needs. 
 What I'm starting to realize is that,you can get media, it's just an enormous amount of work,,and you need an enormous amount of encouragement.,One of those dark spots is Madagascar,,a country which is generally better known for the Dreamworks film,than it is actually known for,the lovely people who live there.,And so the people who founded,Foko Club in Madagascar,weren't actually concerned with trying to change the image of their country.,They were doing something much simpler.,It was a club to learn English,and to learn computers and the internet.,but what happened was that Madagascar,went through a violent coup.,Most independent media was shut down.,And the high school students,who were learning to blog through Foko Club,suddenly found themselves talking to an international audience,about the demonstrations, the violence,,everything that was going on within this country.,So a very, very small program,designed to get people in front of computers,,publishing their own thoughts, publishing independent media,,ended up having a huge impact,on what we know about this country. 
 Now the trick with this is that I'm guessing,most people here don't speak Malagasy.,I'm also guessing that most of you don't even speak Chinese --,which is sort of sad if you think about it,,as it's now the most represented language on the internet.,Fortunately people are trying to figure out how to fix this.,If you're using Google Chrome and you go to a Chinese language site,,you notice this really cute box at the top,,which automatically detects that the page is in Chinese,and very quickly at a mouse click,will give you a translation of the page.,Unfortunately, it's a machine translation of the page.,And while Google is very, very good with some languages,,it's actually pretty dreadful with Chinese.,And the results can be pretty funny.,What you really want -- what I really want,,is eventually the ability to push a button,and have this queued,so a human being can translate this. 
 And if you think this is absurd, it's not.,There's a group right now in China called Yeeyan.,And Yeeyan is a group,of 150,000 volunteers,who get online every day.,They look for the most interesting content in the English language.,They translate roughly 100 articles a day,from major newspapers, major websites.,They put it online for free.,It's the project of a guy named Zhang Lei,,who was living in the United States during the Lhasa riots,and who couldn't believe how biased,American media coverage was.,And he said, "If there's one thing I can do, I can start translating,,so that people between these countries,start understanding each other a little bit better.",And my question to you is:,if Yeeyan can line up 150,000 people,to translate the English internet into Chinese,,where's the English language Yeeyan?,Who's going after Chinese,,which now has 400 million internet users out there?,My guess is at least one of them has something interesting to say. 
 So even if we can find a way to translate from Chinese,,there's no guarantee that we're going to find it.,When we look for information online,,we basically have two strategies.,We use a lot of search.,And search is terrific if you know what you're looking for.,But if what you're looking for is serendipity,,if you want to stumble onto something,that you didn't know you needed,,our main philosophy is to look to our social networks,,to look for our friends.,What are they looking at? Maybe we should be looking at it.,The problem with this is that essentially,what you end up getting after a while is the wisdom of the flock.,You end up flocking with a lot of people,who are probably similar to you,,who have similar interests.,And it's very, very hard to get information,from the other flocks, from the other parts of the world,where people getting together and talking about their own interests.,To do this, at a certain point,,you need someone to bump you out of your flock and into another flock.,You need a guide. 
 So this is Amira Al Hussaini. She is the Middle East editor for Global Voices.,She has one of the hardest jobs in the world.,Not only does she have to keep our Israeli and Palestinian contributors,from killing each other,,she has to figure out,what is going to interest you,about the Middle East.,And in that sense of trying to get you,out of your normal orbit,,and to try to get you to pay attention,to a story about someone who's,given up smoking for the month of Ramadan,,she has to know something about a global audience.,She has to know something about what stories are available.,Basically, she's a deejay.,She's a skilled human curator,who knows what material is available to her,,who's able to listen to the audience,,and who's able to make a selection,and push people forward in one fashion or another.,I don't think this is necessarily an algorithmic process.,I think what's great about the internet,is that it actually makes it much easier,for deejays to reach a wider audience.,I know Amira.,I can ask her what to read.,But with the internet, she's in a position where she can,tell a lot of people what to read.,And you can listen to her as well,,if this is a way that you're interested in having your web widened. 
 So once you start widening like this,,once you start lighting up voices in the dark spots,,once you start translating, once you start curating,,you end up in some really weird places.,This is an image from pretty much my favorite blog,,which is AfriGadget.,And AfriGadget is a blog that looks,at technology in an Africa context.,And specifically, it's looking at a blacksmith,in Kibera in Nairobi,,who is turning the shaft of a Landrover,into a cold chisel.,And when you look at this image, you might find yourself going,,"Why would I conceivably care about this?",And the truth is, this guy can probably explain this to you.,This is Erik Hersman. You guys may have seen him around the conference.,He goes by the moniker White African.,He's both a very well known American geek,,but he's also Kenyan; he was born in Sudan, grew up in Kenya.,He is a bridge figure.,He is someone who literally has feet in both worlds --,one in the world of the African technology community,,one in the world of the American technology community.,And so he's able to tell a story,about this blacksmith in Kibera,and turn it into a story about repurposing technology,,about innovating from constraint,,about looking for inspiration based on reusing materials.,He knows one world,,and he's finding a way to communicate it to another world,,both of which he has deep connections to.,These bridge figures, I'm pretty well convinced,,are the future of how we try to make the world wider,through using the web. 
 But the trick with bridges is, ultimately,,you need someone to cross them.,And that's where we start talking about xenophiles.,So if I found myself in the NFL,,I suspect I would spend my off-season,nursing my wounds, enjoying my house, so on and so forth --,possibly recording a hip-hop album.,Dhani Jones,,who is the middle linebacker for the Cincinnati Bengals,,has a slightly different approach to the off-season.,Dhani has a television show.,It's called "Dhani Tackles the Globe.",And every week on this television show,,Dhani travels to a different nation of the world.,He finds a local sporting team.,He trains with them for a week, and he plays a match with them.,And his reason for this,is not just that he wants to master Muay Thai boxing.,It's because, for him,,sport is the language,that allows him to encounter,the full width and wonder of the world.,For some of us it might be music. For some of us it might be food.,For a lot of us it might be literature or writing.,But there are all these different techniques,that allow you to go out and look at the world,and find your place within it. 
 The goal of my Talk here,is not to persuade the people in this room,to embrace your xenophilia.,My guess -- given that you're at a conference called TEDGlobal --,is that most of you are xenophiles,,whether or not you use that term.,My challenge instead is this.,It's not enough to make the personal decision,that you want a wider world.,We have to figure out how to rewire,the systems that we have.,We have to fix our media.,We have to fix the internet. We have to fix our education.,We have to fix our immigration policy.,We need to look at ways,of creating serendipity,,of making translation pervasive,,and we need to find ways to embrace,and celebrate these bridge figures.,And we need to figure out how to cultivate xenophiles.,That's what I'm trying to do. I need your help. 
 (Applause)Our face is hugely important,because it's the external, visual part,that everybody else sees.,Let's not forget it's a functional entity.,We have strong skull bones,that protect the most important organ in our body: the brain.,It's where our senses are located, our special senses --,our vision, our speech,,our hearing, our smell, our taste.,And this bone,is peppered, as you can see, with the light shining through the skull,with cavities, the sinuses,,which warm and moisten the air we breathe.,But also imagine if they were filled with solid bone --,our head would be dead weight,,we wouldn't be able to hold it erect,,we wouldn't be able to look at the world around us.,This woman is slowly dying,because the benign tumors in her facial bones,have completely obliterated her mouth and her nose,so she can't breathe and eat. 
 Attached to the facial bones,that define our face's structure,are the muscles that deliver our facial expression,,our universal language of expression,,our social-signaling system.,And overlying this is the skin drape,,which is a hugely complex,three-dimensional structure --,taking right-angled bends here and there,,having thin areas like the eyelids,,thick areas like the cheek, different colors.,And then we have the sensual factor of the face.,Where do we like to kiss people?,On the lips. Nibble the ears maybe.,It's the face where we're attracted to with that. 
 But let's not forget the hair.,You're looking at the image on your left-hand side --,that's my son with his eyebrows present.,Look how odd he looks with the eyebrows missing.,There's a definite difference.,And imagine if he had hair sprouting from the middle of his nose,,he'd look even odder still. 
 Dysmorphophobia,is an extreme version,of the fact that we don't see ourselves,as others see us.,It's a shocking truth,that we only see mirror images of ourselves,,and we only see ourselves,in freeze-frame photographic images,that capture a mere fraction of the time that we live.,Dysmorphophobia,is a perversion of this,where people who may be very good looking,regard themselves as hideously ugly,and are constantly seeking surgery,to correct their facial appearance.,They don't need this. They need psychiatric help.,Max has kindly donated his photograph to me.,He doesn't have dysmorphophobia, but I'm using his photograph,to illustrate the fact that he looks exactly like a dysmorphophobic.,In other words, he looks entirely normal. 
 Age is another thing,when our attitude toward our appearance changes.,So children judge themselves, learn to judge themselves,,by the behavior of adults around them.,Here's a classic example: Rebecca has a benign blood vessel tumor,that's growing out through her skull, has obliterated her nose,,and she's having difficulty seeing.,As you can see, it's blocking her vision.,She's also in danger, when she damages this,,of bleeding profusely.,Our research has shown,that the parents and close loved ones of these children,adore them.,They've grown used to their face; they think they're special.,Actually, sometimes the parents argue,about whether these children should have the lesion removed.,And occasionally they suffer intense grief reactions,because the child they've grown to love,has changed so dramatically and they don't recognize them.,But other adults,say incredibly painful things.,They say, "How dare you take this child out of the house,and terrify other people.,Shouldn't you be doing something about this? Why haven't you had it removed?",And other children in curiosity come up and poke the lesion,,because -- a natural curiosity.,And that obviously alerts the child,to their unusual nature.,After surgery, everything normalizes.,The adults behave more naturally,,and the children play more readily with other children. 
 As teenagers --,just think back to your teenage years --,we're going through a dramatic,and often disproportionate change,in our facial appearance.,We're trying to struggle to find our identity.,We crave the approval of our peers.,So our facial appearance is vital to us,as we're trying to project ourselves to the world.,Just remember that single acne spot,that crippled you for several days.,How long did you spend looking in the mirror every day,,practicing your sardonic look, practicing your serious look,,trying to look like Sean Connery, as I did,,trying to raise one eyebrow?,It's a crippling time. 
 I've chosen to show this profile view of Sue,because what it shows is her lower jaw jutting forward,and her lower lip jutting forward.,I'd like you all in the audience now to push your lower jaw forward.,Turn to the person next to you,,push your lower jaws forward. Turn to the person next to you,and look at them -- they look miserable.,That's exactly what people used to say to Sue.,She wasn't miserable at all.,But people used to say to her, "Why are you so miserable?",People were making misjudgments all the time,on her mood.,Teachers and peers were underestimating her; she was teased at school.,So she chose to have facial surgery.,After the facial surgery,,she said, "My face now reflects my personality.,People know now that I'm enthusiastic,,that I'm a happy person.",And that's the change that can be achieved for teenagers. 
 Is this change, though, a real change,,or is it a figment of the imagination,of the patient themselves?,Well we studied teenagers' attitudes,to photographs of patients having this corrective facial surgery.,And what we found was --,we jumbled up the photographs,so they couldn't recognize the before and after --,what we found was that the patients were regarded,as being more attractive after the surgery.,Well that's not surprising, but we also asked them to judge them,on honesty, intelligence,,friendliness, violence.,They were all perceived as being,less than normal in all those characteristics --,more violent, etc. -- before the surgery.,After the surgery,,they were perceived as being more intelligent,,more friendly, more honest, less violent --,and yet we hadn't operated on their intellect,or their character. 
 When people get older,,they don't necessarily choose to follow this kind of surgery.,Their presence in the consultation suite,is a result of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune.,What happens to them,is that they may have suffered cancer or trauma.,So this is a photograph of Henry,,two weeks after he had a malignant cancer removed,from the left side of his face -- his cheekbone,,his upper jaw, his eye-socket.,He looks pretty good at this stage.,But over the course of the next 15 years he had 14 more operations,,as the disease ravaged his face,and destroyed my reconstruction regularly.,I learned a huge amount from Henry.,Henry taught me,that you can carry on working.,He worked as an advocate. He continued to play cricket.,He enjoyed life to the full,,and this was probably because he had a successful, fulfilling job,and a caring family,and was able to participate socially.,He maintained a calm insouciance.,I don't say he overcame this; he didn't overcome it.,This was something more than that. He ignored it.,He ignored the disfigurement that was happening in his life,and carried on oblivious to it.,And that's what these people can do. 
 Henriapi illustrates this phenomenon as well.,This is a man in his 20s,whose first visit out of Nigeria was with this malignant cancer,that he came to the United Kingdom to have operated on.,It was my longest operation.,It took 23 hours. I did it with my neurosurgeon.,We removed all the bones at the right side of his face --,his eye, his nose,,the skull bones, the facial skin --,and reconstructed him with tissue from the back.,He continued to work as a psychiatric nurse.,He got married. He had a son called Jeremiah.,And again, he said,,"This painting of me with my son Jeremiah,shows me as the successful man that I feel that I am.",His facial disfigurement,did not affect him,because he had the support of a family;,he had a successful, fulfilling job. 
 So we've seen that we can change people's faces.,But when we change people's faces,,are we changing their identity --,for better or for worse?,For instance,,there are two different types of facial surgery.,We can categorize it like that.,We can say there are patients who choose to have facial surgery --,like Sue.,When they have facial surgery,,they feel their lives have changed,because other people perceive them,as better people.,They don't feel different.,They feel that they've actually gained,what they never had,,that their face now reflects their personality.,And actually that's probably the difference between cosmetic surgery,and this kind of surgery.,Because you might say, "Well, this type of surgery,might be regarded as cosmetic.",If you do cosmetic surgery, patients are often less happy.,They're trying to achieve difference in their lives.,Sue wasn't trying to achieve difference in her life.,She was just trying to achieve the face,that matched her personality. 
 But then we have other people,who don't choose to have facial surgery.,They're people who have their face shot off.,I'll move it off, and we'll have a blank slide for those who are squeamish amongst you.,They have it forced upon them.,And again, as I told you,,if they have a caring family,and good work life,,then they can lead normal and fulfilled lives.,Their identity doesn't change. 
 Is this business,about appearance and preoccupation with it,a Western phenomenon?,Muzetta's family give the lie to this.,This is a little Bangladeshi girl from the east end of London,who's got a huge malignant tumor on the right side of her face,,which has already made her blind,and which is rapidly growing and is going to kill her shortly.,After she had surgery to remove the tumor,,her parents dressed her in this beautiful green velvet dress,,a pink ribbon in her hair,,and they wanted the painting to be shown around the world,,despite the fact that they were orthodox Muslims,and the mother wore a full burqa.,So it's not simply a Western phenomenon. 
 We make judgments on people's faces,all the time.,It's been going on since we can think of Lombroso,and the way he would define criminal faces.,He said you could see criminal faces,,judging them just on the photographs that were showed.,Good-looking people,are always judged as being more friendly.,We look at O.J. --,he's a good-looking guy.,We'd like to spend time with him. He looks friendly.,Now we know that he's a convicted wife-batterer,,and actually he's not the good guy.,And beauty doesn't equate to goodness,,and certainly doesn't equate to contentment. 
 So we've talked about the static face,and judging the static face,,but actually, we're more comfortable,with judging the moving face.,We think we can judge people on their expressions.,U.K. jurors in the U.K. justice system,like to see a live witness,to see whether they can pick up the telltale signs of mendacity --,the blink, the hesitation.,And so they want to see live witnesses.,Todorov tells us that, in a tenth of a second,,we can make a judgment on somebody's face.,Are we uncomfortable with this image? Yes, we are.,Would we be happy if our doctor's face, our lawyer's face,,our financial adviser's face was covered?,We'd be pretty uncomfortable.,But are we good at making the judgments,on facial appearance and movement?,The truth is that there's a five-minute rule,,not the tenth-of-a-second rule like Todorov, but a five-minute rule.,If you spend five minutes with somebody,,you start looking beyond their facial appearance,,and the people who you're initially attracted to,may seem boring and you lose interest in them,,and the people who you didn't immediately seek out,,because you didn't find them particularly attractive,,become attractive people,because of their personality. 
 So we've talked a lot about facial appearance.,I now want to share,a little bit of the surgery that we do --,where we're at and where we're going.,This is an image of Ann,who's had her right jaw removed and the base of her skull removed.,And you can see in the images afterward,,we've managed to reconstruct her successfully.,But that's not good enough.,This is what Ann wants. She wants to be out kayaking,,she wants to be out climbing mountains.,And that's what she achieved, and that's what we have to get to. 
 This is a horrific image,,so I'm putting my hand up now.,This is a photograph of Adi,,a Nigerian bank manager who had his face shot off,in an armed robbery.,And he lost his lower jaw, his lip, his chin,and his upper jaw and teeth.,This is the bar that he set for us.,"I want to look like this. This is how I looked before.",So with modern technology,,we used computers to make models.,We made a model of the jaw without bone in it.,We then bent a plate up to it.,We put it in place,so we knew it was an accurate position.,We then put bone and tissue from the back.,Here you can see the plate holding it,,and you can see the implants being put in --,so that in one operation,we achieve this,and this.,So the patient's life is restored.,That's the good news.,However, his chin skin,doesn't look the same as it did before.,It's skin from his back.,It's thicker, it's darker, it's coarser, it doesn't have the contours.,And that's where we're failing,,and that's where we need the face transplant. 
 The face transplant has a role,probably in burns patients to replace the skin.,We can replace the underlying skeletal structure,,but we're still not good at replacing the facial skin.,So it's very valuable,to have that tool in our armamentarium.,But the patients are going to have to take drugs,that suppress their immune system for the rest of their lives.,What does that mean?,They have an increased risk of infection, an increased risk of malignancy.,This is not a life-saving transplant --,like a heart, or liver, or lung transplant --,it is a quality-of-life transplant,,and as a result,,are the patients going to say, if they get a malignant cancer 10 or 15 years on,,"I wish I'd had conventional reconstructive techniques rather than this,because I'm now dying of a malignant cancer"? We don't know yet.,We also don't know what they feel,about recognition and identity.,Bernard Devauchelle and Sylvie Testelin, who did the first operation,,are studying that.,Donors are going to be short on the ground,,because how many people want to have their loved one's face,removed at the point of death?,So there are going to be problems,with face transplantation. 
 So the better news is,the future's almost here --,and the future is tissue engineering.,Just imagine,,I can make a biologically-degradable template.,I can put it in place where it's meant to be.,I can sprinkle a few cells,,stem cells from the patient's own hip,,a little bit of genetically engineered protein,,and lo and behold, leave it for four months and the face is grown.,This is a bit like a Julia Child recipe. 
 But we've still got problems.,We've got mouth cancer to solve.,We're still not curing enough patients -- it's the most disfiguring cancer.,We're still not reconstructing them well enough.,In the U.K. we have an epidemic,of facial injuries among young people.,We still can't get rid of scars.,We need to do research.,And the best news of all,is that surgeons know,that we need to do research.,And we've set up charities,that will help us fund,the clinical research,to determine the best treatment practice now,and better treatment into the future,,so we don't just sit on our laurels and say, "Okay, we're doing okay.,Let's leave it as it is." 
 Thank you very much indeed. 
 (Applause)The stories we tell about each other,matter very much.,The stories we tell ourselves about our own lives matter.,And most of all,,I think the way that we participate in each other's stories,is of deep importance.,I was six years old,when I first heard stories about the poor.,Now I didn't hear those stories from the poor themselves,,I heard them from my Sunday school teacher,and Jesus, kind of via my Sunday school teacher.,I remember learning that people who were poor,needed something material --,food, clothing, shelter -- that they didn't have.,And I also was taught, coupled with that,,that it was my job -- this classroom full of five and six year-old children --,it was our job, apparently, to help.,This is what Jesus asked of us.,And then he said, "What you do for the least of these, you do for me.",Now I was pretty psyched.,I was very eager to be useful in the world --,I think we all have that feeling.,And also, it was kind of interesting that God needed help.,That was news to me,,and it felt like it was a very important thing to get to participate in. 
 But I also learned very soon thereafter,that Jesus also said, and I'm paraphrasing,,the poor would always be with us.,This frustrated and confused me;,I felt like I had been just given a homework assignment,that I had to do, and I was excited to do,,but no matter what I would do, I would fail.,So I felt confused, a little bit frustrated and angry,,like maybe I'd misunderstood something here.,And I felt overwhelmed.,And for the first time,,I began to fear this group of people,and to feel negative emotion towards a whole group of people.,I imagined in my head, a kind of long line of individuals,that were never going away, that would always be with us.,They were always going to ask me to help them and give them things,,which I was excited to do,,but I didn't know how it was going to work.,And I didn't know what would happen when I ran out of things to give,,especially if the problem was never going away.,In the years following,,the other stories I heard about the poor growing up,were no more positive.,For example, I saw pictures and images,frequently of sadness and suffering.,I heard about things that were going wrong in the lives of the poor.,I heard about disease, I heard about war --,they always seemed to be kind of related.,And in general,,I got this sort of idea,that the poor in the world lived lives,that were wrought with suffering and sadness,,devastation, hopelessness. 
 And after a while, I developed what I think many of us do,,is this predictable response,,where I started to feel bad every time I heard about them.,I started to feel guilty for my own relative wealth,,because I wasn't doing more, apparently, to make things better.,And I even felt a sense of shame because of that.,And so naturally,,I started to distance myself.,I stopped listening to their stories,quite as closely as I had before.,And I stopped expecting things to really change.,Now I still gave -- on the outside it looked like I was still quite involved.,I gave of my time and my money,,I gave when solutions were on sale.,The cost of a cup of coffee can save a child's life, right.,I mean who can argue with that?,I gave when I was cornered, when it was difficult to avoid,and I gave, in general, when the negative emotions built up enough,that I gave to relieve my own suffering,,not someone else's.,The truth be told, I was giving out of that place,,not out of a genuine place of hope,and excitement to help and of generosity.,It became a transaction for me,,became sort of a trade.,I was purchasing something --,I was buying my right to go on with my day,and not necessarily be bothered by this bad news.,And I think the way that we go through that sometimes,can, first of all,,disembody a group of people, individuals out there in the world.,And it can also turn into a commodity,,which is a very scary thing.,So as I did this, and as I think many of us do this,,we kind of buy our distance,,we kind of buy our right to go on with our day.,I think that exchange can actually get in the way of the very thing that we want most.,It can get in the way of our desire,to really be meaningful and useful in another person's life,and, in short to love. 
 Thankfully, a few years ago, things shifted for me,because I heard this gentleman speak, Dr. Muhammad Yunus.,I know many in the room probably know exactly who he is,,but to give the shorthand version,for any who have not heard him speak,,Dr. Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago,for his work pioneering modern microfinance.,When I heard him speak, it was three years before that.,But basically, microfinance -- if this is new to you as well --,think of that as financial services for the poor.,Think of all the things you get at your bank,and imagine those products and services,tailored to the needs of someone living on a few dollars a day.,Dr. Yunus shared his story,,explaining what that was,,and what he had done with his Grameen Bank.,He also talked about, in particular, microlending,,which is a tiny loan,that could help someone start or grow a business.,Now, when I heard him speak, it was exciting for a number of reasons.,First and foremost, I learned about this new method of change in the world,that, for once, showed me, maybe,,a way to interact with someone,and to give, to share of a resource in a way that wasn't weird,and didn't make me feel bad --,that was exciting.,But more importantly, he told stories about the poor,that were different than any stories I had heard before.,In fact, those individuals he talked about who were poor was sort of a side note.,He was talking about strong, smart,,hardworking entrepreneurs who woke up every day,and were doing things to make their lives and their family's lives better.,All they needed to do that more quickly and to do it better,was a little bit of capital.,It was an amazing sort of insight for me. 
 And I, in fact, was so deeply moved by this --,it's hard to express now how much that affected me --,but I was so moved that I actually quit my job a few weeks later,,and I moved to East Africa,to try to see for myself what this was about.,For the first time, actually, in a long time,I wanted to meet those individuals, I wanted to meet these entrepreneurs,,and see for myself what their lives were actually about.,So I spent three months in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania,interviewing entrepreneurs that had received 100 dollars,to start or grow a business.,And in fact, through those interactions,,for the first time, I was starting to get to be friends,with some of those people in that big amorphous group out there,that was supposed to be far away.,I was starting to be friends and get to know their personal stories.,And over and over again,,as I interviewed them and spent my days with them,,I did hear stories of life change,and amazing little details of change. 
 So I would hear from goat herders,who had used that money that they had received to buy a few more goats.,Their business trajectory would change.,They would make a little bit more money;,their standard of living,would shift and would get better.,And they would make really interesting little adjustments in their lives,,like they would start to send their children to school.,They might be able to buy mosquito nets.,Maybe they could afford a lock for the door and feel secure.,Maybe it was just that they could put sugar in their tea,and offer that to me when I came as their guest,and that made them feel proud.,But there were these beautiful details, even if I talked to 20 goat herders in a row,,and some days that's what happened --,these beautiful details of life change,that were meaningful to them.,That was another thing that really touched me.,It was really humbling to see for the first time,,to really understand,that even if I could have taken a magic wand and fixed everything,,I probably would have gotten a lot wrong.,Because the best way for people to change their lives,is for them to have control and to do that in a way that they believe is best for them.,So I saw that and it was very humbling. 
 Anyway, another interesting thing happened while I was there.,I never once was asked for a donation,,which had kind of been my mode, right.,There's poverty, you give money to help --,no one asked me for a donation.,In fact, no one wanted me to feel bad for them at all.,If anything, they just wanted to be able to do more of what they were doing already,and to build on their own capabilities.,So what I did hear, once in a while,,was that people wanted a loan --,I thought that sounded very reasonable and really exciting.,And by the way, I was a philosophy and poetry major in school,,so I didn't know the difference between profit and revenue when I went to East Africa.,I just got this impression that the money would work.,And my introduction to business,was in these $100 little infuses of capital.,And I learned about profit and revenue, about leverage, all sorts of things,,from farmers, from seamstresses, from goat herders.,So this idea,that these new stories of business and hope,might be shared with my friends and family,,and through that, maybe we could get some of the money that they needed,to be able to continue their businesses as loans,,that's this little idea that turned into Kiva. 
 A few months later, I went back to Uganda,with a digital camera and a basic website,that my partner, Matthew, and I had kind of built,,and took pictures of seven of my new friends,,posted their stories, these stories of entrepreneurship, up on the website,,spammed friends and family and said, "We think this is legal.,Haven't heard back yet from SEC on all the details,,but do you say, do you want to help participate in this,,provide the money that they need?",The money came in basically overnight.,We sent it over to Uganda.,And over the next six months, a beautiful thing happened;,the entrepreneurs received the money,,they were paid, and their businesses, in fact, grew,,and they were able to support themselves,and change the trajectory of their lives.,In October of '05,,after those first seven loans were paid,,Matt and I took the word beta off of the site.,We said, "Our little experiment has been a success.,Let's start for real." That was our official launch.,And then that first year, October '05 through '06,,Kiva facilitated $500,000 in loans.,The second year, it was a total of 15 million.,The third year, the total was up to around 40.,The fourth year, we were just short of 100.,And today, less than five years in,,Kiva's facilitated,more than 150 million dollars, in little 25-dollar bits,,from lenders and entrepreneurs --,more than a million of those, collectively in 200 countries. 
 So that's where Kiva is today, just to bring you right up to the present.,And while those numbers and those statistics,are really fun to talk about and they're interesting,,to me, Kiva's really about stories.,It's about retelling,the story of the poor,,and it's about giving ourselves,an opportunity to engage,that validates their dignity,,validates a partnership relationship,,not a relationship that's based,on the traditional sort of donor beneficiary,weirdness that can happen.,But instead a relationship that can promote respect,and hope,and this optimism,that together we can move forward.,So what I hope is that,,not only can the money keep flowing forth through Kiva --,that's a very positive and meaningful thing --,but I hope Kiva can blur those lines, like I said,,between the traditional rich and poor categories,that we're taught to see in the world,,this false dichotomy of us and them, have and have not.,I hope that Kiva can blur those lines.,Because as that happens,,I think we can feel free to interact,in a way that's more open, more just and more creative,,to engage with each other and to help each other. 
 Imagine how you feel,when you see somebody on street who is begging,and you're about to approach them.,Imagine how you feel;,and then imagine the difference when you might see somebody,who has a story of entrepreneurship and hard work,who wants to tell you about their business.,Maybe they're smiling, and they want to talk to you about what they've done.,Imagine if you're speaking with somebody,who's growing things and making them flourish,,somebody who's using their talents,to do something productive,,somebody who's built their own business from scratch,,someone who is surrounded by abundance,,not scarcity,,who's in fact creating abundance,,somebody with full hands with something to offer,,not empty hands,asking for you to give them something.,Imagine if you could hear a story you didn't expect,of somebody who wakes up every day,and works very, very hard to make their life better.,These stories can really change the way that we think about each other.,And if we can catalyze,a supportive community to come around these individuals,and to participate in their story,by lending a little bit of money,,I think that can change the way we believe in each other,and each other's potential. 
 Now for me, Kiva is just the beginning.,And as I look forward to what is next,,it's been helpful to reflect on the things I've learned so far.,The first one is, as I mentioned, entrepreneurship was a new idea to me.,Kiva borrowers, as I interviewed them and got to know them over the last few years,,have taught me what entrepreneurship is.,And I think, at its core, it's deciding that you want your life to be better.,You see an opportunity,and you decide what you're going to do to try to seize that.,In short, it's deciding that tomorrow can better than today,and going after that.,Second thing that I've learned is that loans are a very interesting tool for connectivity.,So they're not a donation.,Yeah, maybe it doesn't sound that much different.,But in fact, when you give something to someone,and they say, "Thanks," and let you know how things go,,that's one thing.,When you lend them money, and they slowly pay you back over time,,you have this excuse to have an ongoing dialogue.,This continued attention -- this ongoing attention --,is a really big deal,to build different kinds of relationships among us.,And then third, from what I've heard from the entrepreneurs I've gotten to know,,when all else is equal,,given the option to have just money to do what you need to do,,or money plus the support and encouragement,of a global community,,people choose the community plus the money.,That's a much more meaningful combination, a more powerful combination. 
 So with that in mind, this particular incident,has led to the things that I'm working on now.,I see entrepreneurs everywhere now, now that I'm tuned into this.,And one thing that I've seen,is there are a lot of supportive communities that already exist in the world.,With social networks,,it's an amazing way, growing the number of people that we all have around us,in our own supportive communities, rapidly.,And so, as I have been thinking about this,,I've been wondering: how can we engage these supportive communities,to catalyze even more entrepreneurial ideas,and to catalyze all of us,to make tomorrow better than today?,As I've researched what's going on in the United States,,a few interesting little insights have come up.,So one is that, of course, as we all might expect,,many small businesses in the U.S. and all over the world,still need money to grow and to do more of what they want to do,or they might need money during a hard month.,But there's always a need for resources close by.,Another thing is, it turns out,,those resources don't usually come from the places you might expect --,banks, venture capitalists,,other organizations and support structures --,they come from friends and family.,Some statistics say 85 percent or more of funding for small businesses,comes from friends and family.,That's around 130 billion dollars a year --,it's a lot.,And third, so as people are doing this friends and family fundraising process,,it's very awkward, people don't know exactly what to ask for,,how to ask, what to promise in return,,even though they have the best of intentions,and want to thank those people that are supporting them. 
 So to harness the power of these supportive communities in a new way,and to allow entrepreneurs to decide for themselves,exactly what that financial exchange should look like,,exactly what fits them and the people around them,,this week actually,,we're quietly doing a launch of Profounder,,which is a crowd funding platform for small businesses to raise what they need,through investments from their friends and family.,And it's investments, not donations, not loans,,but investments that have a dynamic return.,So the mapping of participating in the story,,it actually flows with the up and down.,So in short, it's a do-it-yourself tool,for small businesses to raise these funds.,And what you can do is go onto the site, create a profile,,create investment terms in a really easy way.,We make it really, really simple for me,as well as anyone else who wants to use the site.,And we allow entrepreneurs to share a percentage of their revenues.,They can raise up to a million dollars,from an unlimited number of unaccredited, unsophisticated investors --,everyday people, heaven forbid --,and they can share those returns over time --,again, whatever terms they set.,As investors choose to become involved,based on those terms,,they can either take their rewards back as cash,,or they can decide in advance,to give those returns away to a non-profit.,So they can be a cash, or a cause, investor.,It's my hope that this kind of tool can show anybody who has an idea,a path to go do what they want to do in the world,and to gather the people around them that they already have,,the people that know them best,and that love them and want to support them,,to gather them to make this happen. 
 So that's what I'm working on now.,And to close, I just want to say, look these are tools.,Right now, Profounder's right at the very beginning,,and it's very palpable; it's very clear to me, that it's just a vessel, it's just a tool.,What we need are for people to care, to actually go use it,,just like they've cared enough to use Kiva,to make those connections.,But the good news is I don't think I need to stand here and convince you to care --,I'm not even going to try.,I don't think, even though we often hear,,you know, hear the ethical and moral reasons,,the religious reasons,,"Here's why caring and giving will make you happier.",I don't think we need to be convinced of that. I think we know;,in fact, I think we know so much,,and it's such a reality,that we care so deeply,,that in fact, what usually stops us,is that we're afraid to try and to mess up,,because we care so very much about helping each other,and being meaningful in each other's lives. 
 So what I think I can do today,,that best thing I can give you --,I've given you my story, which is the best I can do.,And I think I can remind us that we do care.,I think we all already know that.,And I think we know that love is resilient enough,for us to get out there and try.,Just a sec. 
 (Applause) 
 Thanks. 
 (Applause) 
 Thanks. 
 (Applause) 
 For me, the best way to be inspired to try,is to stop and to listen,to someone else's story.,And I'm grateful that I've gotten to do that here at TED.,And I'm grateful that whenever I do that,,guaranteed, I am inspired --,I am inspired by the person I am listening to.,And I believe more and more every time I listen,in that that person's potential to do great things in the world,and in my own potential to maybe help.,And that --,forget the tools, forget the moving around of resources --,that stuff's easy.,Believing in each other,,really being sure when push comes to shove,that each one of us can do amazing things in the world,,that is what can make our stories into love stories,and our collective story,into one that continually perpetuates hope,and good things for all of us.,So that, this belief in each other,,knowing that without a doubt,and practicing that every day in whatever you do,,that's what I believe will change the world and make tomorrow better than today. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Come with me to the bottom of the world,,Antarctica,,the highest, driest, windiest,,and yes, coldest region on Earth --,more arid than the Sahara,and, in parts, colder than Mars.,The ice of Antarctica glows,with a light so dazzling,,it blinds the unprotected eye.,Early explorers rubbed cocaine in their eyes,to kill the pain of it.,The weight of the ice is such that the entire continent,sags below sea level, beneath its weight.,Yet, the ice of Antarctica,is a calendar of climate change.,It records the annual rise and fall,of greenhouse gases and temperatures,going back before the onset of the last ice ages.,Nowhere on Earth,offers us such a perfect record.,And here, scientists are drilling,into the past of our planet,to find clues to the future,of climate change. 
 This past January,,I traveled to a place called WAIS Divide,,about 600 miles from the South Pole.,It is the best place on the planet, many say,,to study the history of climate change.,There, about 45 scientists from the University of Wisconsin,,the Desert Research Institute in Nevada and others,have been working to answer a central question,about global warming.,What is the exact relationship,between levels of greenhouse gases,and planetary temperatures?,It's urgent work. We know that temperatures are rising.,This past May was the warmest worldwide on record.,And we know that levels of greenhouse gases are rising too.,What we don't know,is the exact, precise, immediate,impact of these changes,on natural climate patterns --,winds, ocean currents,,precipitation rates, cloud formation,,things that bear on the health and well-being,of billions of people. 
 Their entire camp, every item of gear,,was ferried 885 miles,from McMurdo Station,,the main U.S. supply base,on the coast of Antarctica.,WAIS Divide itself though,,is a circle of tents in the snow.,In blizzard winds, the crew sling ropes between the tents,so that people can feel their way safely,to the nearest ice house,and to the nearest outhouse.,It snows so heavily there,,the installation was almost immediately buried.,Indeed, the researchers picked this site,because ice and snow accumulates here,10 times faster than anywhere else in Antarctica.,They have to dig themselves out every day.,It makes for an exotic,and chilly commute. 
 (Laughter) 
 But under the surface,is a hive of industrial activity,centered around an eight-million-dollar drill assembly.,Periodically, this drill, like a biopsy needle,,plunges thousands of feet deep into the ice,to extract a marrow of gases,and isotopes for analysis.,Ten times a day, they extract,the 10-foot long cylinder of compressed ice crystals,that contain the unsullied air and trace chemicals,laid down by snow,,season after season for thousands of years.,It's really a time machine.,At the peak of activity earlier this year,,the researchers lowered the drill,an extra hundred feet deeper into the ice every day,and another 365 years,deeper into the past.,Periodically, they remove,a cylinder of ice,,like gamekeepers popping a spent shotgun shell,from the barrel of a drill.,They inspect it, they check it for cracks,,for drill damage, for spalls, for chips. 
 More importantly,,they prepare it for inspection and analysis,by 27 independent laboratories,in the United States and Europe,,who will examine it for 40 different trace chemicals,related to climate,,some in parts per quadrillion.,Yes, I said that with a Q, quadrillion.,They cut the cylinders up into three-foot sections,for easier handling and shipment,back to these labs,,some 8,000 miles from the drill site.,Each cylinder,is a parfait of time. 
 This ice formed as snow,15,800 years ago,,when our ancestors were daubing themselves with paint,and considering the radical new technology,of the alphabet.,Bathed in polarized light,and cut in cross-section,,this ancient ice reveals itself,as a mosaic of colors,,each one showing how conditions at depth in the ice,have affected this material,at depths where pressures can reach,a ton per square inch.,Every year, it begins with a snowflake,,and by digging into fresh snow,,we can see how this process is ongoing today.,This wall of undisturbed snow,,back-lit by sunlight,,shows the striations of winter and summer snow,,layer upon layer.,Each storm scours the atmosphere,,washing out dust, soot,,trace chemicals,,and depositing them on the snow pack,year after year,,millennia after millennia,,creating a kind of periodic table of elements,that at this point,is more than 11,000 feet thick.,From this, we can detect an extraordinary number of things.,We can see the calcium,from the world's deserts,,soot from distant wildfires,,methane as an indicator of the strength of a Pacific monsoon,,all wafted on winds from warmer latitudes,to this remote and very cold place. 
 Most importantly,,these cylinders and this snow,trap air.,Each cylinder is about 10 percent ancient air,,a pristine time capsule,of greenhouse gases -- carbon dioxide,,methane, nitrous oxide --,all unchanged from the day that snow formed,and first fell.,And this is the object of their scrutiny.,But don't we already know,what we need to know about greenhouse gases?,Why do we need to study this anymore?,Don't we already know how they affect temperatures?,Don't we already know the consequences,of a changing climate on our settled civilization?,The truth is, we only know the outlines,,and what we don't completely understand,,we can't properly fix.,Indeed, we run the risk of making things worse. 
 Consider, the single most successful,international environmental effort of the 20th century,,the Montreal Protocol,,in which the nations of Earth banded together to protect the planet,from the harmful effects of ozone-destroying chemicals,used at that time,in air conditioners, refrigerators and other cooling devices.,We banned those chemicals,,and we replaced them, unknowingly,,with other substances,that, molecule per molecule,,are a hundred times more potent,as heat-trapping, greenhouse gases,than carbon dioxide. 
 This process requires,extraordinary precautions.,The scientists must insure,that the ice is not contaminated.,Moreover, in this 8,000-mile journey,,they have to insure this ice doesn't melt.,Imagine juggling a snowball across the tropics.,They have to, in fact,,make sure this ice never gets warmer,than about 20 degrees below zero,,otherwise, the key gases inside it will dissipate.,So, in the coldest place on Earth,,they work inside a refrigerator.,As they handle the ice, in fact,,they keep an extra pair of gloves warming in an oven,,so that, when their work gloves freeze,and their fingers stiffen,,they can don a fresh pair.,They work against the clock and against the thermometer. 
 So far, they've packed up,about 4,500 feet of ice cores,for shipment back to the United States.,This past season,,they manhandled them across the ice,to waiting aircraft.,The 109th Air National Guard,flew the most recent shipment of ice,back to the coast of Antarctica,,where it was boarded onto a freighter,,shipped across the tropics to California,,unloaded, put on a truck,,driven across the desert,to the National Ice Core Laboratory in Denver, Colorado,,where, as we speak,,scientists are now slicing this material up,for samples, for analysis,,to be distributed,to the laboratories around the country,and in Europe. 
 Antarctica was this planet's,last empty quarter --,the blind spot,in our expanding vision of the world.,Early explorers,sailed off the edge of the map,,and they found a place,where the normal rules of time and temperature,seem suspended.,Here, the ice seems a living presence.,The wind that rubs against it,gives it voice.,It is a voice of experience.,It is a voice we should heed. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Okay, I'm going to show you,again something about our diets.,And I would like to know what the audience is,,and so who of you ever ate insects?,That's quite a lot.,(Laughter),But still, you're not representing,the overall population of the Earth.,(Laughter),Because there's 80 percent out there that really eats insects.,But this is quite good. 
 Why not eat insects? Well first, what are insects?,Insects are animals that walk around on six legs.,And here you see just a selection.,There's six million species of insects on this planet,,six million species.,There's a few hundreds of mammals --,six million species of insects.,In fact, if we count all the individual organisms,,we would come at much larger numbers.,In fact, of all animals on Earth,,of all animal species,,80 percent walks on six legs.,But if we would count all the individuals,,and we take an average weight of them,,it would amount to something like 200 to 2,000 kilograms,for each of you and me on Earth.,That means that in terms of biomass,,insects are more abundant than we are,,and we're not on a planet of men,,but we're on a planet of insects.,Insects are not only there in nature,,but they also are involved in our economy,,usually without us knowing. 
 There was an estimation,,a conservative estimation, a couple of years ago,that the U.S. economy,benefited by 57 billion,dollars per year.,It's a number -- very large --,a contribution to the economy of the United States for free.,And so I looked up what the economy was paying,for the war in Iraq,in the same year.,It was 80 billion U.S. dollars.,Well we know that that,was not a cheap war.,So insects, just for free,,contribute to the economy of the United States,with about the same order of magnitude,,just for free, without everyone knowing.,And not only in the States,,but in any country, in any economy. 
 What do they do?,They remove dung, they pollinate our crops.,A third of all the fruits that we eat,are all a result,of insects taking care of the reproduction of plants.,They control pests,,and they're food for animals.,They're at the start of food chains.,Small animals eat insects.,Even larger animals eat insects.,But the small animals that eat insects,are being eaten by larger animals,,still larger animals.,And at the end of the food chain, we are eating them as well.,There's quite a lot of people that are eating insects.,And here you see me,in a small, provincial town in China, Lijiang --,about two million inhabitants.,If you go out for dinner, like in a fish restaurant,,where you can select which fish you want to eat,,you can select which insects you would like to eat.,And they prepare it in a wonderful way.,And here you see me enjoying a meal,with caterpillars, locusts,,bee pupae -- delicacies.,And you can eat something new everyday.,There's more than 1,000 species of insects,that are being eaten all around the globe.,That's quite a bit more,than just a few mammals that we're eating,,like a cow or a pig,or a sheep.,More than 1,000 species --,an enormous variety.,And now you may think, okay,,in this provincial town in China they're doing that, but not us. 
 Well we've seen already that quite some of you,already ate insects maybe occasionally,,but I can tell you that every one of you,is eating insects, without any exception.,You're eating at least,500 grams per year.,What are you eating?,Tomato soup, peanut butter,,chocolate, noodles --,any processed food that you're eating,contains insects,,because insects are here all around us,,and when they're out there in nature,they're also in our crops.,Some fruits get some insect damage.,Those are the fruits, if they're tomato,,that go to the tomato soup.,If they don't have any damage, they go to the grocery.,And that's your view of a tomato.,But there's tomatoes that end up in a soup,,and as long as they meet,the requirements of the food agency,,there can be all kinds of things in there,,no problem.,In fact, why would we put these balls in the soup,,there's meat in there anyway?,(Laughter),In fact, all our processed foods,contain more proteins,than we would be aware of.,So anything is a good protein source already. 
 Now you may say,,"Okay, so we're eating 500 grams just by accident.",We're even doing this on purpose.,In a lot of food items that we have --,I have only two items,here on the slide --,pink cookies or surimi sticks,or, if you like, Campari --,a lot of our food products that are of a red color,are dyed with a natural dye.,The surimi sticks,[of] crabmeat, or is being sold as crab meat,,is white fish,that's being dyed with cochineal.,Cochineal is a product,of an insect that lives off these cacti.,It's being produced in large amounts,,150 to 180 metric tons per year,in the Canary Islands in Peru,,and it's big business.,One gram of cochineal,costs about 30 euros.,One gram of gold,is 30 euros.,So it's a very precious thing,that we're using to dye our foods. 
 Now the situation in the world is going to change,for you and me, for everyone on this Earth.,The human population is growing very rapidly,and is growing exponentially.,Where, at the moment, we have,something between six and seven billion people,,it will grow to about nine billion,in 2050.,That means that we have a lot more mouths to feed,,and this is something that worries more and more people.,There was an FAO conference last October,that was completely devoted to this.,How are we going to feed this world?,And if you look at the figures up there,,it says that we have a third more mouths to feed,,but we need an agricultural production increase,of 70 percent.,And that's especially because this world population,is increasing,,and it's increasing, not only in numbers,,but we're also getting wealthier,,and anyone that gets wealthier starts to eat more,and also starts to eat more meat.,And meat, in fact, is something,that costs a lot,of our agricultural production. 
 Our diet consists, [in] some part, of animal proteins,,and at the moment, most of us here,get it from livestock,,from fish, from game.,And we eat quite a lot of it.,In the developed world it's on average,80 kilograms per person per year,,which goes up to 120,in the United States,and a bit lower in some other countries,,but on average 80 kilograms,per person per year.,In the developing world it's much lower.,It's 25 kilograms per person per year.,But it's increasing enormously.,In China in the last 20 years,,it increased from 20 to 50,,and it's still increasing.,So if a third of the world population,is going to increase its meat consumption,from 25 to 80 on average,,and a third of the world population,is living in China and in India,,we're having an enormous demand on meat.,And of course, we are not there to say,that's only for us, it's not for them.,They have the same share that we have. 
 Now to start with, I should say,that we are eating way too much meat,in the Western world.,We could do with much, much less --,and I know, I've been a vegetarian for a long time,,and you can easily do without anything.,You'll get proteins in any kind of food anyway.,But then there's a lot of problems,that come with meat production,,and we're being faced with that more and more often.,The first problem that we're facing is human health.,Pigs are quite like us.,They're even models in medicine,,and we can even transplant organs from a pig to a human.,That means that pigs also share diseases with us.,And a pig disease,,a pig virus, and a human virus,can both proliferate,,and because of their kind of reproduction,,they can combine and produce a new virus.,This has happened in the Netherlands in the 1990s,during the classical swine fever outbreak.,You get a new disease that can be deadly.,We eat insects -- they're so distantly related from us,that this doesn't happen.,So that's one point for insects. 
 (Laughter) 
 And there's the conversion factor.,You take 10 kilograms of feed,,you can get one kilogram of beef,,but you can get nine kilograms of locust meat.,So if you would be an entrepreneur,,what would you do?,With 10 kilograms of input,,you can get either one or nine kg. of output.,So far we're taking,the one, or up to five kilograms of output.,We're not taking the bonus yet.,We're not taking the nine kilograms of output yet.,So that's two points for insects. 
 (Laughter) 
 And there's the environment.,If we take 10 kilograms of food --,(Laughter),and it results in one kilogram of beef,,the other nine kilograms are waste,,and a lot of that is manure.,If you produce insects, you have less manure,per kilogram of meat that you produce.,So less waste.,Furthermore, per kilogram of manure,,you have much, much less ammonia,and fewer greenhouse gases,when you have insect manure,than when you have cow manure.,So you have less waste,,and the waste that you have is not as environmental malign,as it is with cow dung.,So that's three points for insects. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now there's a big "if," of course,,and it is if insects produce meat,that is of good quality.,Well there have been all kinds of analyses,and in terms of protein, or fat, or vitamins,,it's very good.,In fact, it's comparable,to anything we eat as meat at the moment.,And even in terms of calories, it is very good.,One kilogram of grasshoppers,has the same amount of calories,as 10 hot dogs, or six Big Macs.,So that's four points for insects. 
 (Laughter) 
 I can go on,,and I could make many more points for insects,,but time doesn't allow this.,So the question is, why not eat insects?,I gave you at least four arguments in favor.,We'll have to.,Even if you don't like it,,you'll have to get used to this,because at the moment,,70 percent of all our agricultural land,is being used to produce livestock.,That's not only the land,where the livestock is walking and feeding,,but it's also other areas,where the feed is being produced and being transported.,We can increase it a bit,at the expense of rainforests,,but there's a limitation very soon.,And if you remember that we need to increase,agricultural production by 70 percent,,we're not going to make it that way.,We could much better change,from meat, from beef,,to insects.,And then 80 percent of the world,already eats insects,,so we are just a minority --,in a country like the U.K., the USA,,the Netherlands, anywhere.,On the left-hand side, you see a market in Laos,where they have abundantly present,all kinds of insects that you choose for dinner for the night.,On the right-hand side you see a grasshopper.,So people there are eating them,,not because they're hungry,,but because they think it's a delicacy.,It's just very good food.,You can vary enormously.,It has many benefits. 
 In fact, we have delicacy,that's very much like this grasshopper:,shrimps, a delicacy,being sold at a high price.,Who wouldn't like to eat a shrimp?,There are a few people who don't like shrimp,,but shrimp, or crabs,,or crayfish,,are very closely related.,They are delicacies.,In fact, a locust is a "shrimp" of the land,,and it would make very good into our diet.,So why are we not eating insects yet?,Well that's just a matter of mindset.,We're not used to it,,and we see insects as these organisms that are very different from us.,That's why we're changing the perception of insects.,And I'm working very hard with my colleague, Arnold van Huis,,in telling people what insects are,,what magnificent things they are,,what magnificent jobs they do in nature.,And in fact, without insects,,we would not be here in this room,,because if the insects die out,,we will soon die out as well.,If we die out, the insects will continue very happily. 
 (Laughter) 
 So we have to get used to the idea of eating insects.,And some might think, well they're not yet available.,Well they are.,There are entrepreneurs in the Netherlands that produce them,,and one of them is here in the audience,,Marian Peeters, who's in the picture.,I predict that later this year, you'll get them in the supermarkets --,not visible, but as animal protein,in the food.,And maybe by 2020,,you'll buy them just knowing that this is an insect that you're going to eat.,And they're being made in the most wonderful ways.,A Dutch chocolate maker.,(Music),(Applause),So there's even a lot of design to it. 
 (Laughter) 
 Well in the Netherlands, we have an innovative Minister of Agriculture,,and she puts the insects on the menu,in her restaurant in her ministry.,And when she got all the Ministers of Agriculture of the E.U.,over to the Hague recently,,she went to a high-class restaurant,,and they ate insects all together.,It's not something that is a hobby of mine.,It's really taken off the ground.,So why not eat insects?,You should try it yourself.,A couple of years ago, we had 1,750 people all together,in a square in Wageningen town,,and they ate insects at the same moment,,and this was still big, big news.,I think soon it will not be big news anymore when we all eat insects,,because it's just a normal way of doing. 
 So you can try it yourself today,,and I would say, enjoy.,And I'm going to show to Bruno some first tries,,and he can have the first bite. 
 (Applause) 
 Bruno Giussani: Look at them first. Look at them first. 
 Marcel Dicke: It's all protein. 
 BG: That's exactly the same [one] you saw in the video actually.,And it looks delicious.,They just make it [with] nuts or something. 
 MD: Thank you.

 Bruno Giussani: Come back.,Miwa Matreyek! 
 (Applause)I love video games.,I'm also slightly in awe of them.,I'm in awe of their power,in terms of imagination, in terms of technology,,in terms of concept.,But I think, above all,,I'm in awe at their power,to motivate, to compel us,,to transfix us,,like really nothing else we've ever invented,has quite done before.,And I think that we can learn some pretty amazing things,by looking at how we do this.,And in particular, I think we can learn things,about learning.,Now the video games industry,is far and away the fastest growing,of all modern media.,From about 10 billion in 1990,,it's worth 50 billion dollars globally today,,and it shows no sign of slowing down.,In four years' time,,it's estimated it'll be worth over 80 billion dollars.,That's about three times the recorded music industry.,This is pretty stunning,,but I don't think it's the most telling statistic of all.,The thing that really amazes me,is that, today,,people spend about,eight billion real dollars a year,buying virtual items,that only exist,inside video games.,This is a screenshot from the virtual game world, Entropia Universe.,Earlier this year,,a virtual asteroid in it,sold for 330,000 real dollars.,And this,is a Titan class ship,in the space game, EVE Online.,And this virtual object,takes 200 real people,about 56 days of real time to build,,plus countless thousands of hours,of effort before that.,And yet, many of these get built.,At the other end of the scale,,the game Farmville that you may well have heard of,,has 70 million players,around the world,and most of these players,are playing it almost every day. 
 This may all sound,really quite alarming to some people,,an index of something worrying,or wrong in society.,But we're here for the good news,,and the good news is,that I think we can explore,why this very real human effort,,this very intense generation of value, is occurring.,And by answering that question,,I think we can take something,extremely powerful away.,And I think the most interesting way,to think about how all this is going on,is in terms of rewards.,And specifically, it's in terms,of the very intense emotional rewards,that playing games offers to people,both individually,and collectively.,Now if we look at what's going on in someone's head,when they are being engaged,,two quite different processes are occurring.,On the one hand, there's the wanting processes.,This is a bit like ambition and drive -- I'm going to do that. I'm going to work hard.,On the other hand, there's the liking processes,,fun and affection,and delight,and an enormous flying beast with an orc on the back.,It's a really great image. It's pretty cool.,It's from the game World of Warcraft with more than 10 million players globally,,one of whom is me, another of whom is my wife.,And this kind of a world,,this vast flying beast you can ride around,,shows why games are so very good,at doing both the wanting and the liking.,Because it's very powerful. It's pretty awesome.,It gives you great powers.,Your ambition is satisfied, but it's very beautiful.,It's a very great pleasure to fly around.,And so these combine to form,a very intense emotional engagement. 
 But this isn't the really interesting stuff.,The really interesting stuff about virtuality,is what you can measure with it.,Because what you can measure in virtuality,is everything.,Every single thing that every single person,who's ever played in a game has ever done can be measured.,The biggest games in the world today,are measuring more than one billion points of data,about their players, about what everybody does --,far more detail than you'd ever get from any website.,And this allows something very special,to happen in games.,It's something called the reward schedule.,And by this, I mean looking,at what millions upon millions of people have done,and carefully calibrating the rate,,the nature, the type, the intensity of rewards in games,to keep them engaged,over staggering amounts of time and effort.,Now, to try and explain this,in sort of real terms,,I want to talk about a kind of task,that might fall to you in so many games.,Go and get a certain amount of a certain little game-y item.,Let's say, for the sake of argument,,my mission is to get 15 pies,and I can get 15 pies,by killing these cute, little monsters.,Simple game quest.,Now you can think about this, if you like,,as a problem about boxes.,I've got to keep opening boxes.,I don't know what's inside them until I open them.,And I go around opening box after box until I've got 15 pies.,Now, if you take a game like Warcraft,,you can think about it, if you like,,as a great box-opening effort.,The game's just trying to get people to open about a million boxes,,getting better and better stuff in them. 
 This sounds immensely boring,but games are able,to make this process,incredibly compelling.,And the way they do this,is through a combination of probability and data.,Let's think about probability.,If we want to engage someone,in the process of opening boxes to try and find pies,,we want to make sure it's neither too easy,,nor too difficult, to find a pie.,So what do you do? Well, you look at a million people --,no, 100 million people, 100 million box openers --,and you work out, if you make the pie rate,about 25 percent --,that's neither too frustrating, nor too easy.,It keeps people engaged.,But of course, that's not all you do -- there's 15 pies.,Now, I could make a game called Piecraft,,where all you had to do was get a million pies,or a thousand pies.,That would be very boring.,Fifteen is a pretty optimal number.,You find that -- you know, between five and 20,is about the right number for keeping people going.,But we don't just have pies in the boxes.,There's 100 percent up here.,And what we do is make sure that every time a box is opened,,there's something in it, some little reward,that keeps people progressing and engaged.,In most adventure games,,it's a little bit in-game currency, a little bit experience.,But we don't just do that either. 
 We also say there's going to be loads of other items,of varying qualities and levels of excitement.,There's going to be a 10 percent chance you get a pretty good item.,There's going to be a 0.1 percent chance,you get an absolutely awesome item.,And each of these rewards is carefully calibrated to the item.,And also, we say,,"Well, how many monsters? Should I have the entire world full of a billion monsters?",No, we want one or two monsters on the screen at any one time.,So I'm drawn on. It's not too easy, not too difficult.,So all this is very powerful.,But we're in virtuality. These aren't real boxes.,So we can do,some rather amazing things.,We notice, looking at all these people opening boxes,,that when people get to about 13 out of 15 pies,,their perception shifts, they start to get a bit bored, a bit testy.,They're not rational about probability.,They think this game is unfair.,It's not giving me my last two pies. I'm going to give up.,If they're real boxes, there's not much we can do,,but in a game we can just say, "Right, well.,When you get to 13 pies, you've got 75 percent chance of getting a pie now.",Keep you engaged. Look at what people do --,adjust the world to match their expectation.,Our games don't always do this.,And one thing they certainly do at the moment,is if you got a 0.1 percent awesome item,,they make very sure another one doesn't appear for a certain length of time,to keep the value, to keep it special. 
 And the point is really,that we evolved to be satisfied by the world,in particular ways.,Over tens and hundreds of thousands of years,,we evolved to find certain things stimulating,,and as very intelligent, civilized beings,,we're enormously stimulated by problem solving and learning.,But now, we can reverse engineer that,and build worlds,that expressly tick our evolutionary boxes.,So what does all this mean in practice?,Well, I've come up,with seven things,that, I think, show,how you can take these lessons from games,and use them outside of games.,The first one is very simple:,experience bars measuring progress --,something that's been talked about brilliantly,by people like Jesse Schell earlier this year.,It's already been done at the University of Indiana in the States, among other places.,It's the simple idea that instead of grading people incrementally,in little bits and pieces,,you give them one profile character avatar,which is constantly progressing,in tiny, tiny, tiny little increments which they feel are their own.,And everything comes towards that,,and they watch it creeping up, and they own that as it goes along. 
 Second, multiple long and short-term aims --,5,000 pies, boring,,15 pies, interesting.,So, you give people,lots and lots of different tasks.,You say, it's about,doing 10 of these questions,,but another task,is turning up to 20 classes on time,,but another task is collaborating with other people,,another task is showing you're working five times,,another task is hitting this particular target.,You break things down into these calibrated slices,that people can choose and do in parallel,to keep them engaged,and that you can use to point them,towards individually beneficial activities. 
 Third, you reward effort.,It's your 100 percent factor. Games are brilliant at this.,Every time you do something, you get credit; you get a credit for trying.,You don't punish failure. You reward every little bit of effort --,a little bit of gold, a little bit of credit. You've done 20 questions -- tick.,It all feeds in as minute reinforcement. 
 Fourth, feedback.,This is absolutely crucial,,and virtuality is dazzling at delivering this.,If you look at some of the most intractable problems in the world today,that we've been hearing amazing things about,,it's very, very hard for people to learn,if they cannot link consequences to actions.,Pollution, global warming, these things --,the consequences are distant in time and space.,It's very hard to learn, to feel a lesson.,But if you can model things for people,,if you can give things to people that they can manipulate,and play with and where the feedback comes,,then they can learn a lesson, they can see,,they can move on, they can understand. 
 And fifth,,the element of uncertainty.,Now this is the neurological goldmine,,if you like,,because a known reward,excites people,,but what really gets them going,is the uncertain reward,,the reward pitched at the right level of uncertainty,,that they didn't quite know whether they were going to get it or not.,The 25 percent. This lights the brain up.,And if you think about,using this in testing,,in just introducing control elements of randomness,in all forms of testing and training,,you can transform the levels of people's engagement,by tapping into this very powerful,evolutionary mechanism.,When we don't quite predict something perfectly,,we get really excited about it.,We just want to go back and find out more. 
 As you probably know, the neurotransmitter,associated with learning is called dopamine.,It's associated with reward-seeking behavior.,And something very exciting is just beginning to happen,in places like the University of Bristol in the U.K.,,where we are beginning to be able to model mathematically,dopamine levels in the brain.,And what this means is we can predict learning,,we can predict enhanced engagement,,these windows, these windows of time,,in which the learning is taking place at an enhanced level.,And two things really flow from this.,The first has to do with memory,,that we can find these moments.,When someone is more likely to remember,,we can give them a nugget in a window.,And the second thing is confidence,,that we can see how game-playing and reward structures,make people braver, make them more willing to take risks,,more willing to take on difficulty,,harder to discourage.,This can all seem very sinister.,But you know, sort of "our brains have been manipulated; we're all addicts.",The word "addiction" is thrown around.,There are real concerns there.,But the biggest neurological turn-on for people,is other people.,This is what really excites us.,In reward terms, it's not money;,it's not being given cash -- that's nice --,it's doing stuff with our peers,,watching us, collaborating with us. 
 And I want to tell you a quick story about 1999 --,a video game called EverQuest.,And in this video game,,there were two really big dragons, and you had to team up to kill them --,42 people, up to 42 to kill these big dragons.,That's a problem,because they dropped two or three decent items.,So players addressed this problem,by spontaneously coming up with a system,to motivate each other,,fairly and transparently.,What happened was, they paid each other a virtual currency,they called "dragon kill points.",And every time you turned up to go on a mission,,you got paid in dragon kill points.,They tracked these on a separate website.,So they tracked their own private currency,,and then players could bid afterwards,for cool items they wanted --,all organized by the players themselves.,Now the staggering system, not just that this worked in EverQuest,,but that today, a decade on,,every single video game in the world with this kind of task,uses a version of this system --,tens of millions of people.,And the success rate,is at close to 100 percent.,This is a player-developed,,self-enforcing, voluntary currency,,and it's incredibly sophisticated,player behavior. 
 And I just want to end by suggesting,a few ways in which these principles,could fan out into the world.,Let's start with business.,I mean, we're beginning to see some of the big problems,around something like business are,recycling and energy conservation.,We're beginning to see the emergence of wonderful technologies,like real-time energy meters.,And I just look at this, and I think, yes,,we could take that so much further,by allowing people to set targets,by setting calibrated targets,,by using elements of uncertainty,,by using these multiple targets,,by using a grand, underlying reward and incentive system,,by setting people up,to collaborate in terms of groups, in terms of streets,to collaborate and compete,,to use these very sophisticated,group and motivational mechanics we see.,In terms of education,,perhaps most obviously of all,,we can transform how we engage people.,We can offer people the grand continuity,of experience and personal investment.,We can break things down,into highly calibrated small tasks.,We can use calculated randomness.,We can reward effort consistently,as everything fields together.,And we can use the kind of group behaviors,that we see evolving when people are at play together,,these really quite unprecedentedly complex,cooperative mechanisms.,Government, well, one thing that comes to mind,is the U.S. government, among others,,is literally starting to pay people,to lose weight.,So we're seeing financial reward being used,to tackle the great issue of obesity.,But again, those rewards,could be calibrated so precisely,if we were able to use the vast expertise,of gaming systems to just jack up that appeal,,to take the data, to take the observations,,of millions of human hours,and plow that feedback,into increasing engagement. 
 And in the end, it's this word, "engagement,",that I want to leave you with.,It's about how individual engagement,can be transformed,by the psychological and the neurological lessons,we can learn from watching people that are playing games.,But it's also about collective engagement,and about the unprecedented laboratory,for observing what makes people tick,and work and play and engage,on a grand scale in games.,And if we can look at these things and learn from them,and see how to turn them outwards,,then I really think we have something quite revolutionary on our hands. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I'm going to share with you the story,as to how I have become,an HIV/AIDS campaigner.,And this is the name of my campaign: SING Campaign.,In November of 2003,,I was invited to take part,in the launch of Nelson Mandela's,46664 Foundation --,that is his HIV/AIDS foundation.,And 46664 is the number,that Mandela had when he was imprisoned in Robben Island.,And that's me with Youssou N'Dour,,onstage, having the time of my life.,The next day, all the artists were invited,to join Mandela in Robben Island,,where he was going to give a conference,to the world's press,,standing in front of his former prison cell.,You can see the bars of the window there.,It was quite a momentous occasion for all of us.,In that moment in time,,Mandela told the world's press,that there was a virtual genocide,taking place in his country;,that post-apartheid,Rainbow Nation,,a thousand people were dying on a daily basis,and that the front line victims,,the most vulnerable of all,,were women and children. 
 This was a huge impact on my mind,,because I am a woman and I am a mother,,and I hadn't realized,that the HIV/AIDS pandemic,was directly affecting women in such a way.,And so I committed -- when I left South Africa,,when I left Capetown,,I told myself, "This is going to be something,that I have to talk about.,I have to serve.",And so, subsequently,I participated in every single,46664 event,that I could take part in,and gave news conferences,,interviews,,talking and using my platform as a musician,,with my commitment to Mandela --,out of respect for the tremendous,,unbelievable work that he had done.,Everyone in the world respects Nelson Mandela,,everyone reveres Nelson Mandela.,But do they all know,about what has been taking place in South Africa,,his country,,the country that had one of the highest incidents,of transmission of the virus?,I think that if I went out into the street now,and I told people what was happening there,,they would be shocked. 
 I was very, very fortunate a couple of years later,to have met Zackie Achmat,,the founder of Treatment Action Campaign,,an incredible campaigner and activist.,I met him at a 46664 event.,He was wearing a t-shirt like the one I wear now.,This is a tool --,this tells you I am in solidarity,with people who have HIV,,people who are living with HIV.,And in a way because of the stigma, by wearing this t-shirt,I say, "Yes, we can talk about this issue.,It doesn't have to be in the closet.",I became a member of Treatment Action Campaign,and I'm very proud to be a member,of that incredible organization.,It's a grassroots campaign,with 80 percent membership being women,,most of whom are HIV-positive.,They work in the field.,They have tremendous outreach,to the people who are living directly,with the effects of the virus.,They have education programs.,They bring out the issues of stigma.,It's quite extraordinary what they do.,And yes, my SING Campaign,has supported Treatment Action Campaign,in the way that I have tried to raise awareness,and to try to also raise funds.,A lot of the funding that I have managed to raise,has gone directly to Treatment Action Campaign,and the incredible work that they do,,and are still continuing to do in South Africa. 
 So this is my SING Campaign.,SING Campaign is basically just me,and about three or four wonderful people,who help to support me.,I've traveled all over the world,in the last two and a half years --,I went to about 12 different countries.,Here I am in Oslo in Norway,,getting a nice, fat check;,singing in Hong Kong, trying to get people to raise money.,In Johannesburg, I had the opportunity to play,to a mainly white, middle-class South African audience,who ended up in tears,because I use film clips,that really touch the heart, the whole nature,,of this terrible tragedy that is taking place,,that people are tending to avoid,,because they are fatigued,,and they really don't quite know what the solutions are.,Aaron Motsoaledi, the current health minister,,attended that concert,and I had an opportunity to meet with him,,and he gave his absolute commitment,to try to making a change,,which is absolutely necessary.,This is in the Scottish Parliament.,I've subsequently become an envoy,for Scotland and HIV.,And I was showing them my experiences,and trying to, again, raise awareness.,And once again, in Edinburgh,with the wonderful African Children's Choir who I simply adore.,And it's children like this, many of whom have been orphaned,because of their family being affected,by the AIDS virus. 
 I'm sitting here in New York with Michel Sidibe --,he's the director of UNAIDS.,And I'm very honored,by the fact that Michel invited me,,only a few months ago,,to become a UNAIDS ambassador.,And in this way, I've been strengthening my platform,and broadening my outreach.,The message that UNAIDS,are currently sending out to the world,is that we would like to see the virtual elimination,of the transmission of the virus,from mother to child by 2015.,It's a very ambitious goal,but we believe it can be achieved with political will.,This can happen. 
 And here I am with a pregnant woman,,who is HIV positive,and we're smiling, both of us are smiling, because we're very confident,,because we know that that young woman,is receiving treatment,so her life can be extended,to take care of the baby she's about to give birth to.,And her baby will receive PMTCT,,which will mean that that baby,can be born free of the virus.,Now that is prevention,at the very beginning of life.,It's one way to start looking at intervention,with the AIDS pandemic. 
 Now, I just would like to finish off,to tell you the little story,about Avelile.,This is Avelile --,she goes with me wherever I go.,I tell her story to everyone,because she represents,one of millions,of HIV/AIDS orphans.,Avelile's mother,had HIV virus --,she died,from AIDS-related illness.,Avelile had the virus,,she was born with the virus.,And here she is at seven years old,,weighing no more than a one year-old baby.,At this point in her life,,she's suffering with full-blown AIDS,and had pneumonia.,We met her in a hospital in the Eastern Cape,and spent a whole afternoon with her -- an adorable child.,The doctors and nurses were phenomenal.,They put her on very special nutritious diet,and took great care of her.,And we didn't know when we left the hospital --,because we filmed her story -- we didn't know if she was going to survive.,So, it was obviously -- it was a very emotional encounter,and left us feeling very resonant,with this direct experience, this one child,,you know, that story.,Five months later,,we went back to South Africa,to meet Avelile again.,And I'm getting --,the hairs on my -- I don't know if you can see the hairs on my arms.,They're standing up because I know what I'm going to show you.,This is the transformation that took place.,Isn't it extraordinary? 
 (Applause) 
 That round of applause is actually,for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of Avelile.,And I take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation.,So, I would like to say to you,,each one in the audience,,if you feel that every mother,and every child in the world,has the right to have access,to good nutrition and good medical care,,and you believe that the Millennium Development Goals,,specifically five and six,,should be absolutely committed to,by all governments around the world --,especially in sub-Saharan Africa --,could you please stand up.,I think that's fair to say,,it's almost everyone in the hall. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Restaurants and the food industry in general,are pretty much the most wasteful industry,in the world.,For every calorie of food that we consume here in Britain today,,10 calories are taken to produce it.,That's a lot.,I want to take something rather humble,to discuss.,I found this in the farmers' market today,,and if anybody wants to take it home and mash it later, you're very welcome to.,The humble potato --,and I've spent a long time, 25 years, preparing these.,And it pretty much goes through,eight different forms in its lifetime.,First of all, it's planted, and that takes energy.,It grows and is nurtured.,It's then harvested.,It's then distributed,,and distribution is a massive issue.,It's then sold and bought,,and it's then delivered to me.,I basically take it, prepare it,,and then people consume it -- hopefully they enjoy it.,The last stage is basically waste,,and this is is pretty much where everybody disregards it.,There are different types of waste.,There's a waste of time; there's a waste of space; there's a waste of energy;,and there's a waste of waste.,And every business I've been working on,over the past five years,,I'm trying to lower each one of these elements. 
 Okay, so you ask what a sustainable restaurant looks like.,Basically a restaurant just like any other.,This is the restaurant, Acorn House.,Front and back.,So let me run you through a few ideas.,Floor: sustainable, recyclable.,Chairs: recycled and recyclable.,Tables: Forestry Commission.,This is Norwegian Forestry Commission wood.,This bench, although it was uncomfortable for my mom --,she didn't like sitting on it,,so she went and bought these cushions for me from a local jumble sale --,reusing, a job that was pretty good.,I hate waste, especially walls.,If they're not working, put a shelf on it, which I did,,and that shows all the customers my products.,The whole business is run on sustainable energy.,This is powered by wind. All of the lights are daylight bulbs.,Paint is all low-volume chemical,,which is very important when you're working in the room all the time.,I was experimenting with these -- I don't know if you can see it --,but there's a work surface there.,And that's a plastic polymer.,And I was thinking, well I'm trying to think nature, nature, nature.,But I thought, no, no, experiment with resins,,experiment with polymers.,Will they outlive me? They probably might.,Right, here's a reconditioned coffee machine.,It actually looks better than a brand new one -- so looking good there.,Now reusing is vital.,And we filter our own water.,We put them in bottles, refrigerate them,,and then we reuse that bottle again and again and again.,Here's a great little example.,If you can see this orange tree, it's actually growing in a car tire,,which has been turned inside out and sewn up.,It's got my compost in it, which is growing an orange tree, which is great. 
 This is the kitchen, which is in the same room.,I basically created a menu that allowed people,to choose the amount and volume of food,that they wanted to consume.,Rather than me putting a dish down,,they were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they wanted.,Okay, it's a small kitchen. It's about five square meters.,It serves 220 people a day.,We generate quite a lot of waste.,This is the waste room.,You can't get rid of waste.,But this story's not about eliminating it, it's about minimizing it.,In here, I have produce and boxes,that are unavoidable.,I put my food waste into this dehydrating, desiccating macerator --,turns food into an inner material,,which I can store and then compost later. 
 I compost it in this garden.,All of the soil you can see there is basically my food,,which is generated by the restaurant,,and it's growing in these tubs, which I made out of storm-felled trees,and wine casks and all kinds of things.,Three compost bins --,go through about 70 kilos of raw vegetable waste a week --,really good, makes fantastic compost.,A couple of wormeries in there too.,And actually one of the wormeries,was a big wormery. I had a lot of worms in it.,And I tried taking the dried food waste,,putting it to the worms, going, "There you go, dinner.",It was like vegetable jerky,,and killed all of them.,I don't know how many worms [were] in there,,but I've got some heavy karma coming, I tell you.,(Laughter),What you're seeing here is a water filtration system.,This takes the water out of the restaurant,,runs it through these stone beds -- this is going to be mint in there --,and I sort of water the garden with it.,And I ultimately want to recycle that, put it back into the loos,,maybe wash hands with it, I don't know. 
 So, water is a very important aspect.,I started meditating on that,and created a restaurant called Waterhouse.,If I could get Waterhouse to be a no-carbon restaurant,that is consuming no gas to start with, that would be great.,I managed to do it.,This restaurant looks a little bit like Acorn House --,same chairs, same tables.,They're all English and a little bit more sustainable.,But this is an electrical restaurant.,The whole thing is electric, the restaurant and the kitchen.,And it's run on hydroelectricity,,so I've gone from air to water.,Now it's important to understand,that this room,is cooled by water, heated by water,,filters its own water,,and it's powered by water.,It literally is Waterhouse.,The air handling system inside it --,I got rid of air-conditioning,because I thought there was too much consumption going on there.,This is basically air-handling.,I'm taking the temperature of the canal outside,,pumping it through the heat exchange mechanism,,it's turning through these amazing sails on the roof,,and that, in turn, is falling softly onto the people in the restaurant,,cooling them, or heating them, as the need may be.,And this is an English willow air diffuser,,and that's softly moving,that air current through the room.,Very advanced, no air-conditioning -- I love it.,In the canal, which is just outside the restaurant,,there is hundreds of meters of coil piping.,This takes the temperature of the canal,and turns it into this four-degrees of heat exchange.,I have no idea how it works, but I paid a lot of money for it.,(Laughter),And what's great is one of the chefs who works in that restaurant,lives on this boat -- it's off-grid; it generates all its own power.,He's growing all his own fruit, and that's fantastic. 
 There's no accident in names of these restaurants.,Acorn House is the element of wood; Waterhouse is the element of water;,and I'm thinking, well, I'm going to be making,five restaurants based,on the five Chinese medicine acupuncture specialities.,I've got water and wood. I'm just about to do fire.,I've got metal and earth to come.,So you've got to watch your space for that.,Okay. So this is my next project.,Five weeks old,,it's my baby, and it's hurting real bad.,The People's Supermarket.,So basically, the restaurants only really hit,people who believed in what I was doing anyway.,What I needed to do was get food out,to a broader spectrum of people.,So people -- i.e., perhaps, more working-class --,or perhaps people who actually believe in a cooperative.,This is a social enterprise,,not-for-profit cooperative supermarket.,It really is about the social disconnect,between food, communities,in urban settings,and their relationship to rural growers --,connecting communities in London to rural growers.,Really important.,So I'm committing to potatoes; I'm committing to milk;,I'm committing to leeks and broccoli -- all very important stuff.,I've kept the tiles; I've kept the floors;,I've kept the trunking; I've got in some recycled fridges;,I've got some recycled tills; I've got some recycled trolleys.,I mean, the whole thing is is super-sustainable.,In fact, I'm trying and I'm going to make this,the most sustainable supermarket in the world.,That's zero food waste.,And no one's doing that just yet.,In fact, Sainsbury's, if you're watching,,let's have a go. Try it on.,I'm going to get there before you. 
 So nature doesn't create waste,doesn't create waste as such.,Everything in nature is used up in a closed continuous cycle,with waste being the end of the beginning,,and that's been something that's been nurturing me for some time,,and it's an important statement to understand.,If we don't stand up,and make a difference,and think about sustainable food,,think about the sustainable nature of it,,then we may fail.,But, I wanted to get up and show you,that we can do it if we're more responsible.,Environmentally conscious businesses are doable.,They're here. You can see I've done three so far;,I've got a few more to go.,The idea is embryonic.,I think it's important.,I think that if we reduce, reuse, refuse,and recycle -- right at the end there --,recycling is the last point I want to make;,but it's the four R's, rather than the three R's --,then I think we're going to be on our way.,So these three are not perfect -- they're ideas.,I think that there are many problems to come,,but with help, I'm sure I'm going to find solutions.,And I hope you all take part. 
 Thank you very much. (Applause)If nothing else, at least I've discovered,what it is we put our speakers through:,sweaty palms, sleepless nights,,a wholly unnatural fear of clocks.,I mean, it's quite brutal. 
 And I'm also a little nervous about this.,There are nine billion humans coming our way.,Now, the most optimistic dreams,can get dented by the prospect,of people plundering the planet.,But recently, I've become intrigued,by a different way of thinking of large human crowds,,because there are circumstances,where they can do something really cool.,It's a phenomenon that I think,any organization or individual can tap into.,It certainly impacted the way we think about TED's future,,and perhaps the world's future overall. 
 So, let's explore.,The story starts with just a single person,,a child, behaving a little strangely.,This kid is known online as Lil Demon.,He's doing tricks here, dance tricks,,that probably no six-year-old in history ever managed before.,How did he learn them?,And what drove him to spend the hundreds of hours of practice,this must have taken?,Here's a clue. 
 (Video) Lil Demon: ♫ Step your game up. Oh. Oh. ♫,♫ Step your game up. Oh. Oh. ♫ 
 Chris Anderson: So, that was sent to me by this man,,a filmmaker, Jonathan Chu,,who told me that was the moment he realized,the Internet was causing dance to evolve.,This is what he said at TED in February.,In essence,,dancers were challenging each other online to get better;,incredible new dance skills were being invented;,even the six-year-olds were joining in.,It felt like a revolution.,And so Jon had a brilliant idea:,He went out to recruit the best of the best dancers,off of YouTube,to create this dance troupe --,The League of Extraordinary Dancers, the LXD.,I mean, these kids were web-taught,,but they were so good that they got to play at the Oscars this year.,And at TED here in February,,their passion and brilliance just took our breath away. 
 So, this story,of the evolution of dance,seems strangely familiar.,You know, a while after TEDTalks started taking off,,we noticed that speakers,were starting to spend a lot more time in preparation.,It was resulting in incredible new talks like these two.,... Months of preparation,crammed into 18 minutes,,raising the bar cruelly for the next generation of speakers,,with the effects that we've seen this week.,It's not as if J.J. and Jill,actually ended their talks saying, "Step your game up,",but they might as well have.,So, in both of these cases,,you've got these cycles of improvement,,apparently driven,by people watching web video. 
 What is going on here?,Well, I think it's the latest iteration of a phenomenon we can call,"crowd-accelerated innovation.",And there are just three things you need for this thing to kick into gear.,You can think of them,as three dials on a giant wheel.,You turn up the dials, the wheel starts to turn.,And the first thing you need is ... a crowd,,a group of people who share a common interest.,The bigger the crowd,,the more potential innovators there are.,That's important, but actually most people in the crowd,occupy these other roles.,They're creating the ecosystem,from which innovation emerges.,The second thing you need is light.,You need clear, open visibility,of what the best people in that crowd are capable of,,because that is how you will learn,how you will be empowered to participate.,And third, you need desire.,You know, innovation's hard work.,It's based on hundreds of hours of research, of practice.,Absent desire, not going to happen. 
 Now, here's an example -- pre-Internet --,of this machine in action.,Dancers at a street corner --,it's a crowd, a small one,,but they can all obviously see what each other can do.,And the desire part comes, I guess,,from social status, right?,Best dancer walks tall, gets the best date.,There's probably going to be some innovation happening here.,But on the web,,all three dials are ratcheted right up.,The dance community is now global.,There's millions connected.,And amazingly,,you can still see what the best can do,,because the crowd itself shines a light on them,,either directly, through comments, ratings,,email, Facebook, Twitter,,or indirectly,,through numbers of views,,through links that point Google there.,So, it's easy to find the good stuff,,and when you've found it, you can watch it in close-up repeatedly,and read what hundreds of people have written about it.,That's a lot of light. 
 But the desire element,is really dialed way up.,I mean, you might just be a kid with a webcam,,but if you can do something that goes viral,,you get to be seen by the equivalent,of sports stadiums crammed with people.,You get hundreds of strangers writing excitedly about you.,And even if it's not that eloquent -- and it's not --,it can still really make your day.,So, this possibility,of a new type of global recognition,,I think, is driving huge amounts of effort.,And it's important to note that it's not just the stars who are benefiting:,because you can see the best, everyone can learn. 
 Also, the system is self-fueling.,It's the crowd that shines the light and fuels the desire,,but the light and desire are a lethal one-two combination,that attract new people to the crowd.,So, this is a model,that pretty much any organization could use,to try and nurture its own cycle,of crowd-accelerated innovation.,Invite the crowd, let in the light,,dial up the desire.,And the hardest part about that is probably the light,,because it means you have to open up,,you have to show your stuff to the world.,It's by giving away what you think is your deepest secret,that maybe millions of people,are empowered to help improve it. 
 And, very happily, there's one class of people,who really can't make use of this tool.,The dark side of the web,is allergic to the light.,I don't think we're going to see terrorists, for example,,publishing their plans online and saying to the world,,"Please, could you help us to actually,make them work this time?" 
 But you can publish your stuff online.,And if you can get that wheel to turn,,look out. 
 So, at TED,,we've become a little obsessed with this idea of openness.,In fact, my colleague, June Cohen, has taken to calling it "radical openness,",because it works for us each time.,We opened up our talks to the world,,and suddenly there are millions of people out there,helping spread our speakers' ideas,,and thereby making it easier for us,to recruit and motivate the next generation of speakers.,By opening up our translation program,,thousands of heroic volunteers --,some of them watching online right now, and thank you! --,have translated our talks,into more than 70 languages,,thereby tripling our viewership in non-English-speaking countries.,By giving away our TEDx brand,,we suddenly have a thousand-plus,live experiments in the art of spreading ideas.,And these organizers,,they're seeing each other, they're learning from each other.,We are learning from them.,We're getting great talks back from them.,The wheel is turning. 
 Okay, step back a minute.,I mean, it's really not news for me to tell you,that innovation emerges out of groups.,You know, we've heard that this week --,this romantic notion of the lone genius,with the "eureka!" moment that changes the world,is misleading.,Even he said that, and he would know.,We're a social species.,We spark off each other.,It's also not news,to say that the Internet has accelerated innovation.,For the past 15 years,,powerful communities have been connecting online,,sparking off each other.,If you take programmers,,you know, the whole open-source movement,is a fantastic instance of crowd-accelerated innovation.,But what's key here is,,the reason these groups have been able to connect,is because their work output is of the type,that can be easily shared digitally --,a picture, a music file,,software.,And that's why what I'm excited about,,and what I think is under-reported,,is the significance of the rise,of online video. 
 This is the technology,that's going to allow the rest of the world's talents to be shared digitally,,thereby launching a whole new cycle,of crowd-accelerated innovation.,The first few years of the web,were pretty much video-free,,for this reason: video files are huge; the web couldn't handle them.,But in the last 10 years,,bandwidth has exploded a hundredfold.,Suddenly, here we are.,Humanity watches 80 million hours of YouTube every day.,Cisco actually estimates that, within four years,,more than 90 percent of the web's data will be video.,If it's all puppies, porn and piracy,,we're doomed.,I don't think it will be.,Video is high-bandwidth for a reason.,It packs a huge amount of data,,and our brains are uniquely wired to decode it. 
 Here, let me introduce you to Sam Haber.,He's a unicyclist.,Before YouTube,,there was no way for him to discover,his sport's true potential,,because you can't communicate this stuff in words, right?,But looking at video clips posted by strangers,,a world of possibility opens up for him.,Suddenly, he starts to emulate and then to innovate.,And a global community of unicyclists discover each other online,,inspire each other to greatness.,And there are thousands of other examples of this happening --,of video-driven evolution of skills,,ranging from the physical to the artful.,And I have to tell you,,as a former publisher of hobbyist magazines,,I find this strangely beautiful.,I mean, there's a lot of passion right here on this screen. 
 But if Rube Goldberg machines,and video poetry aren't quite your cup of tea,,how about this.,Jove is a website,that was founded to encourage scientists,to publish their peer-reviewed research,on video.,There's a problem with a traditional scientific paper.,It can take months for a scientist in another lab,to figure out how to replicate the experiments,that are described in print.,Here's one such frustrated scientist,,Moshe Pritsker, the founder of Jove.,He told me that the world is wasting,billions of dollars on this.,But look at this video.,I mean, look: if you can show,instead of just describing,,that problem goes away.,So it's not far-fetched to say,that, at some point,,online video is going to dramatically accelerate scientific advance. 
 Here's another example,that's close to our hearts at TED,,where video is sometimes more powerful than print --,the sharing of an idea.,Why do people like watching TEDTalks?,All those ideas are already out there in print.,It's actually faster to read than to view.,Why would someone bother?,Well, so, there's some showing as well as telling.,But even leaving the screen out of it,,there's still a lot more being transferred than just words.,And in that non-verbal portion, there's some serious magic.,Somewhere hidden in the physical gestures,,the vocal cadence, the facial expressions,,the eye contact,,the passion,,the kind of awkward, British body language,,the sense of how the audience are reacting,,there are hundreds of subconscious clues,that go to how well you will understand,,and whether you're inspired --,light, if you like,,and desire.,Incredibly, all of this can be communicated,on just a few square inches of a screen. 
 Reading and writing are actually,relatively recent inventions.,Face-to-face communication has been fine-tuned,by millions of years of evolution.,That's what's made it into this mysterious, powerful thing it is.,Someone speaks,,there's resonance in all these receiving brains,,the whole group acts together.,I mean, this is the connective tissue,of the human superorganism in action.,It's probably driven our culture for millennia.,500 years ago, it ran into,a competitor with a lethal advantage.,It's right here.,Print scaled.,The world's ambitious innovators and influencers,now could get their ideas to spread far and wide,,and so the art of the spoken word,pretty much withered on the vine.,But now, in the blink of an eye,,the game has changed again.,It's not too much to say,that what Gutenberg did for writing,,online video can now do for face-to-face communication.,So, that primal medium,,which your brain is exquisitely wired for ...,that just went global. 
 Now, this is big.,We may have to reinvent an ancient art form.,I mean, today, one person speaking,can be seen by millions,,shedding bright light on potent ideas,,creating intense desire,for learning and to respond --,and in his case, intense desire to laugh.,For the first time in human history,,talented students,don't have to have their potential and their dreams,written out of history by lousy teachers.,They can sit two feet in front of the world's finest. 
 Now, TED is just a small part of this.,I mean, the world's universities are opening up their curricula.,Thousands of individuals and organizations,are sharing their knowledge and data online.,Thousands of people are figuring out new ways,to learn and, crucially,,to respond, completing the cycle.,And so, as we've thought about this,,you know, it's become clear to us,what the next stage of TED's evolution has to be.,TEDTalks can't be a one-way process, one-to-many.,Our future is many-to-many.,So, we're dreaming of ways,to make it easier for you, the global TED community,,to respond to speakers,,to contribute your own ideas,,maybe even your own TEDTalks,,and to help shine a light on the very best of what's out there.,Because, if we can bubble up the very best,from a vastly larger pool,,this wheel turns. 
 Now, is it possible to imagine,a similar process to this,,happening to global education overall?,I mean, does it have to be this painful,,top-down process?,Why not a self-fueling cycle,in which we all can participate?,It's the participation age, right?,Schools can't be silos.,We can't stop learning at age 21.,What if, in the coming crowd of nine billion ...,what if that crowd could learn enough,to be net contributors,,instead of net plunderers?,That changes everything, right?,I mean, that would take more teachers than we've ever had.,But the good news is they are out there.,They're in the crowd,,and the crowd is switching on lights,,and we can see them for the first time,,not as an undifferentiated mass of strangers,,but as individuals we can learn from.,Who's the teacher?,You're the teacher.,You're part of the crowd,that may be about to launch,the biggest learning cycle in human history,,a cycle capable of carrying all of us,to a smarter, wiser, more beautiful place. 
 Here's a group of kids in a village in Pakistan,near where I grew up.,Within five years, each of these kids is going to have access,to a cellphone capable of full-on web video,and capable of uploading video to the web.,I mean, is it crazy to think that this girl,,in the back, at the right, in 15 years,,might be sharing the idea that keeps the world beautiful,for your grandchildren?,It's not crazy; it's actually happening right now. 
 I want to introduce you to a good friend of TED,who just happens to live in Africa's biggest shantytown. 
 (Video) Christopher Makau: Hi. My name is Christopher Makau.,I'm one of the organizers of TEDxKibera.,There are so many good things which are happening right here in Kibera.,There's a self-help group.,They turned a trash place into a garden.,The same spot, it was a crime spot,where people were being robbed.,They used the same trash,to form green manure.,The same trash site,is feeding more than 30 families.,We have our own film school.,They are using Flip cameras,to record, edit,,and reporting to their own channel,,Kibera TV.,Because of a scarcity of land,,we are using the sacks to grow vegetables,,and also [we're] able to save on the cost of living.,Change happens when we see things in a different way.,Today, I see Kibera in a different way.,My message to TEDGlobal,and the entire world is:,Kibera is a hotbed,of innovation and ideas. 
 (Applause) 
 CA: You know what?,I bet Chris has always been an inspiring guy.,What's new -- and it's huge --,is that, for the first time, we get to see him,,and he can see us.,Right now, Chris and Kevin,and Dennis and Dickson and their friends,are watching us, in Nairobi, right now.,Guys,,we've learned from you today.,Thank you. 
 And thank you. 
 (Applause)So I work in marketing, which I love,,but my first passion was physics,,a passion brought to me by a wonderful school teacher,,when I had a little less gray hair.,So he taught me,that physics is cool,because it teaches us so much about the world around us.,And I'm going to spend the next few minutes trying to convince you,that physics can teach us something about marketing. 
 So quick show of hands --,who studied some marketing in university?,Who studied some physics in university?,Pretty good. And at school?,Okay, lots of you.,So, hopefully this will bring back some happy,,or possibly some slightly disturbing memories. 
 So, physics and marketing.,We'll start with something very simple -- Newton's Law:,"The force equals mass times acceleration.",This is something that perhaps Turkish Airlines,should have studied a bit more carefully,before they ran this campaign.,(Laughter),But if we rearrange this formula quickly,,we can get to acceleration equals force over mass,,which means,that for a larger particle -- a larger mass --,it requires more force to change its direction.,It's the same with brands:,the more massive a brand, the more baggage it has,,the more force is needed to change its positioning.,And that's one of the reasons why,Arthur Andersen chose to launch Accenture,rather than try to persuade the world,that Andersen's could stand for something,other than accountancy.,It explains why Hoover,found it very difficult to persuade the world,that it was more than vacuum cleaners,,and why companies like Unilever and P&G,keep brands separate,,like Ariel and Pringles and Dove,rather than having one giant parent brand.,So the physics is that the bigger the mass of an object,the more force is needed,to change its direction.,The marketing is, the bigger a brand,,the more difficult it is to reposition it.,So think about a portfolio of brands,or maybe new brands for new ventures. 
 Now, who remembers Heisenberg's uncertainty principle?,Getting a little more technical now.,So this says that,it's impossible, by definition,,to measure exactly the state -- i.e., the position --,and the momentum of a particle,,because the act of measuring it, by definition, changes it.,So to explain that -- if you've got an elementary particle,and you shine a light on it,,then the photon of light has momentum,,which knocks the particle,,so you don't know where it was before you looked at it.,By measuring it,,the act of measurement changes it.,The act of observation changes it.,It's the same in marketing.,So with the act of observing consumers, changes their behavior.,Think about the group of moms,who are talking about their wonderful children in a focus group,,and almost none of them buy lots of junk food.,And yet, McDonald's sells hundreds of millions of burgers every year.,Think about the people who are on accompanied shops in supermarkets,,who stuff their trolleys,full of fresh green vegetables and fruit,,but don't shop like that any other day.,And if you think about the number of people,who claim in surveys,to regularly look for porn on the Web,,it's very few.,Yet, at Google, we know it's the number-one searched for category.,So luckily, the science --,no, sorry -- the marketing is getting easier.,Luckily, with now better point-of-sale tracking,,more digital media consumption,,you can measure more what consumers actually do,,rather than what they say they do.,So the physics is,you can never accurately and exactly,measure a particle,,because the observation changes it.,The marketing is -- the message for marketing is --,that try to measure what consumers actually do,,rather than what they say they'll do,or anticipate they'll do. 
 So next, the scientific method --,an axiom of physics, of all science --,says you cannot prove a hypothesis through observation,,you can only disprove it.,What this means is you can gather more and more data,around a hypothesis or a positioning,,and it will strengthen it, but it will not conclusively prove it.,And only one contrary data point,can blow your theory out of the water.,So if we take an example --,Ptolemy had dozens of data points to support his theory,that the planets would rotate around the Earth.,It only took one robust observation from Copernicus,to blow that idea out of the water.,And there are parallels for marketing --,you can invest for a long time in a brand,,but a single contrary observation of that positioning,will destroy consumers' belief.,Take BP --,they spent millions of pounds over many years,building up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand,,but then one little accident.,Think about Toyota.,It was, for a long time, revered,as the most reliable of cars,,and then they had the big recall incident.,And Tiger Woods, for a long time,,the perfect brand ambassador.,Well, you know the story.,(Laughter),So the physics is,that you cannot prove a hypothesis,,but it's easy to disprove it --,any hypothesis is shaky.,And the marketing is,that not matter how much you've invested in your brand,,one bad week can undermine decades of good work.,So be really careful to try and avoid the screw-ups,that can undermine your brand. 
 And lastly, to the slightly obscure world of entropy --,the second law of thermodynamics.,This says that entropy,,which is a measure of the disorder of a system,,will always increase.,The same is true of marketing.,If we go back 20 years,,the one message pretty much controlled by one marketing manager,could pretty much define a brand.,But where we are today, things have changed.,You can get a strong brand image,or a message,and put it out there like the Conservative Party did,earlier this year with their election poster.,But then you lose control of it.,With the kind of digital comment creation and distribution tools,that are available now to every consumer,,it's impossible to control where it goes.,Your brand starts being dispersed,,(Laughter),it gets more chaotic.,(Laughter),It's out of your control.,(Laughter),I actually saw him speak -- he did a good job.,But while this may be unsettling for marketers,,it's actually a good thing.,This distribution of brand energy,gets your brand closer to the people,,more in with the people.,It makes this distribution of energy a democratizing force,,which is ultimately good for your brand.,So, the lesson from physics is,that entropy will always increase; it's a fundamental law.,The message for marketing is that your brand is more dispersed.,You can't fight it, so embrace it,and find a way to work with it. 
 So to close,,my teacher, Mr. Vutter, told me,that physics is cool,,and hopefully, I've convinced you,that physics can teach all of us, even in the world of marketing, something special.,Thank you. 
 (Applause)Everyone, please thinknof your biggest personal goal.,For real -- you can take a second.nYou've got to feel this to learn it.,Take a few seconds and thinknof your personal biggest goal, okay?,Imagine deciding right nownthat you're going to do it.,Imagine telling someone that younmeet today what you're going to do.,Imagine their congratulations,,and their high image of you.,Doesn't it feel good to say it out loud?,Don't you feel one step closer already,,like it's already becomingnpart of your identity? 
 Well, bad news: you shouldnhave kept your mouth shut,,because that good feeling,now will make you less likely to do it.,The repeated psychology tests have proven,that telling someone your goalnmakes it less likely to happen.,Any time you have a goal,,there are some steps that need to be done,,some work that needs to be donenin order to achieve it.,Ideally you would not be satisfiednuntil you'd actually done the work.,But when you tell someone your goalnand they acknowledge it,,psychologists have foundnthat it's called a "social reality.",The mind is kind of trickedninto feeling that it's already done.,And then because you've feltnthat satisfaction,,you're less motivated to donthe actual hard work necessary. 
 (Laughter) 
 So this goes against conventional wisdom,that we should tell our friendsnour goals, right?,So they hold us to it. 
 So, let's look at the proof.,1926: Kurt Lewin,nfounder of social psychology,,called this "substitution.",1933: Wera Mahler foundnwhen it was acknowledged by others,,it felt real in the mind.,1982, Peter Gollwitzernwrote a whole book about this,,and in 2009,,he did some new tests that were published. 
 It goes like this:,163 people across four separate tests.,Everyone wrote down their personal goal.,Then half of them announcedntheir commitment to this goal to the room,,and half didn't.,Then everyone was given 45 minutes of work,that would directly lead themntowards their goal,,but they were toldnthat they could stop at any time.,Now, those who kept their mouths shut,worked the entire 45 minutes on average,,and when asked afterward,,said that they feltnthat they had a long way to go still,to achieve their goal.,But those who had announced it,quit after only 33 minutes, on average,,and when asked afterward,,said that they felt much closernto achieving their goal. 
 So if this is true, what can we do?,Well, you could resist the temptationnto announce your goal.,You can delay the gratificationnthat the social acknowledgment brings,,and you can understand that your mindnmistakes the talking for the doing.,But if you do neednto talk about something,,you can state it in a waynthat gives you no satisfaction,,such as, "I really wantnto run this marathon,,so I need to train five times a week,and kick my ass if I don't, okay?" 
 So audience, next time you'rentempted to tell someone your goal,,what will you say? 
 (Silence) 
 Exactly! Well done. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause)Well, indeed, I'm very, very lucky.,My talk essentially got written,by three historic events,that happened within days of each other,in the last two months --,seemingly unrelated, but as you will see,,actually all having to do with,the story I want to tell you today.,The first one was actually a funeral --,to be more precise, a reburial.,On May 22nd, there was a hero's reburial,in Frombork, Poland,of the 16th-century astronomer,who actually changed the world.,He did that, literally,,by replacing the Earth with the Sun,in the center of the Solar System,,and then with this simple-looking act,,he actually launched a scientific,and technological revolution,,which many call the Copernican Revolution.,Now that was,,ironically, and very befittingly,,the way we found his grave.,As it was the custom of the time,,Copernicus was actually,simply buried in an unmarked grave,,together with 14 others,in that cathedral.,DNA analysis,,one of the hallmarks,of the scientific revolution,of the last 400 years that he started,,was the way we found,which set of bones,actually belonged to the person,who read all those astronomical books,which were filled with leftover hair,that was Copernicus' hair --,obviously not many other people,bothered to read these books later on.,That match was unambiguous.,The DNA matched,,and we know that this was indeed,Nicolaus Copernicus. 
 Now, the connection between,biology and DNA,and life,is very tantalizing when you talk about Copernicus,because, even back then,,his followers,very quickly made the logical step,to ask: if the Earth is just a planet,,then what about planets around other stars?,What about the idea of the plurality of the worlds,,about life on other planets?,In fact, I'm borrowing here from one of those,very popular books of the time.,And at the time,,people actually answered that question,positively: "Yes.",But there was no evidence.,And here begins 400 years,of frustration, of unfulfilled dreams --,the dreams of Galileo, Giordano Bruno,,many others --,which never led to the answer,of those very basic questions,which humanity has asked all the time.,"What is life? What is the origin of life?,Are we alone?",And that especially happened in the last 10 years,,at the end of the 20th century,,when the beautiful developments,due to molecular biology,,understanding the code of life, DNA,,all of that seemed to actually,put us, not closer,,but further apart from answering,those basic questions. 
 Now, the good news.,A lot has happened in the last few years,,and let's start with the planets.,Let's start with the old Copernican question:,Are there earths around other stars?,And as we already heard,,there is a way in which,we are trying, and now able,,to answer that question.,It's a new telescope.,Our team, befittingly I think,,named it after one of those dreamers,of the Copernican time,,Johannes Kepler,,and that telescope's sole purpose,is to go out,,find the planets that orbit,other stars in our galaxy,,and tell us how often do planets like our own Earth,happen to be out there.,The telescope is actually,built similarly to,the, well-known to you, Hubble Space Telescope,,except it does have an additional lens --,a wide-field lens,,as you would call it as a photographer.,And if, in the next couple of months,,you walk out in the early evening,and look straight up,and place you palm like this,,you will actually be looking at the field of the sky,where this telescope is searching for planets,day and night, without any interruption,,for the next four years. 
 The way we do that, actually,,is with a method, which we call the transit method.,It's actually mini-eclipses that occur,when a planet passes in front of its star.,Not all of the planets will be fortuitously oriented,for us to be able do that,,but if you have a million stars,,you'll find enough planets.,And as you see on this animation,,what Kepler is going to detect,is just the dimming of the light from the star.,We are not going to see the image of the star and the planet as this.,All the stars for Kepler are just points of light.,But we learn a lot from that:,not only that there is a planet there, but we also learn its size.,How much of the light is being dimmed,depends on how big the planet is.,We learn about its orbit,,the period of its orbit and so on.,So, what have we learned?,Well, let me try to walk you through,what we actually see,and so you understand the news,that I'm here to tell you today. 
 What Kepler does,is discover a lot of candidates,,which we then follow up and find as planets,,confirm as planets.,It basically tells us,this is the distribution of planets in size.,There are small planets, there are bigger planets, there are big planets, okay.,So we count many, many such planets,,and they have different sizes.,We do that in our solar system.,In fact, even back during the ancients,,the Solar System in that sense,would look on a diagram like this.,There will be the smaller planets, and there will be the big planets,,even back to the time of Epicurus,and then of course Copernicus,and his followers.,Up until recently, that was the Solar System --,four Earth-like planets with small radius,,smaller than about two times the size of the Earth --,and that was of course Mercury,,Venus, Mars,,and of course the Earth,,and then the two big, giant planets.,Then the Copernican Revolution,brought in telescopes,,and of course three more planets were discovered.,Now the total planet number,in our solar system was nine.,The small planets dominated,,and there was a certain harmony to that,,which actually Copernicus was very happy to note,,and Kepler was one of the big proponents of.,So now we have Pluto to join the numbers of small planets.,But up until, literally, 15 years ago,,that was all we knew about planets.,And that's what the frustration was.,The Copernican dream was unfulfilled. 
 Finally, 15 years ago,,the technology came to the point,where we could discover a planet around another star,,and we actually did pretty well.,In the next 15 years,,almost 500 planets,were discovered orbiting other stars, with different methods.,Unfortunately, as you can see,,there was a very different picture.,There was of course an explanation for it:,We only see the big planets,,so that's why most of those planets,are really in the category of "like Jupiter.",But you see, we haven't gone very far.,We were still back where Copernicus was.,We didn't have any evidence,whether planets like the Earth are out there.,And we do care about planets like the Earth,because by now we understood,that life as a chemical system,really needs a smaller planet,with water and with rocks,and with a lot of complex chemistry,to originate, to emerge, to survive.,And we didn't have the evidence for that. 
 So today, I'm here to actually give you a first glimpse,of what the new telescope, Kepler,,has been able to tell us in the last few weeks,,and, lo and behold,,we are back to the harmony,and to fulfilling the dreams of Copernicus.,You can see here,,the small planets dominate the picture.,The planets which are marked "like Earth,",[are] definitely more than,any other planets that we see.,And now for the first time, we can say that.,There is a lot more work we need to do with this.,Most of these are candidates.,In the next few years we will confirm them.,But the statistical result,is loud and clear.,And the statistical result is that,planets like our own Earth,are out there.,Our own Milky Way Galaxy is rich in this kind of planets. 
 So the question is: what do we do next?,Well, first of all, we can study them,now that we know where they are.,And we can find those that we would call habitable,,meaning that they have similar conditions,to the conditions,that we experience here on Earth,and where a lot of complex chemistry can happen.,So, we can even put a number,to how many of those planets,now do we expect our own,Milky Way Galaxy harbors.,And the number, as you might expect,,is pretty staggering.,It's about 100 million such planets.,That's great news. Why?,Because with our own little telescope,,just in the next two years,,we'll be able to identify at least 60 of them.,So that's great because then,we can go and study them --,remotely, of course --,with all the techniques that we already have,tested in the past five years.,We can find what they're made of,,would their atmospheres have water, carbon dioxide, methane.,We know and expect that we'll see that. 
 That's great, but that is not the whole news.,That's not why I'm here.,Why I'm here is to tell you that the next step,is really the exciting part.,The one that this step,is enabling us to do is coming next.,And here comes biology --,biology, with its basic question,,which still stands unanswered,,which is essentially:,"If there is life on other planets,,do we expect it to be like life on Earth?",And let me immediately tell you here,,when I say life, I don't mean "dolce vita,",good life, human life.,I really mean life,on Earth, past and present,,from microbes to us humans,,in its rich molecular diversity,,the way we now understand life on Earth,as being a set of molecules and chemical reactions --,and we call that, collectively, biochemistry,,life as a chemical process,,as a chemical phenomenon. 
 So the question is:,is that chemical phenomenon universal,,or is it something,which depends on the planet?,Is it like gravity,,which is the same everywhere in the universe,,or there would be all kinds of different biochemistries,wherever we find them?,We need to know what we are looking for,when we try to do that.,And that's a very basic question, which we don't know the answer to,,but which we can try --,and we are trying -- to answer in the lab.,We don't need to go to space,to answer that question.,And so, that's what we are trying to do.,And that's what many people now are trying to do.,And a lot of the good news comes from that part of the bridge,that we are trying to build as well. 
 So this is one example,that I want to show you here.,When we think of what is necessary,for the phenomenon that we call life,,we think of compartmentalization,,keeping the molecules which are important for life,in a membrane,,isolated from the rest of the environment,,but yet, in an environment in which,they actually could originate together.,And in one of our labs,,Jack Szostak's labs,,it was a series of experiments,in the last four years,that showed that the environments --,which are very common on planets,,on certain types of planets like the Earth,,where you have some liquid water and some clays --,you actually end up with,naturally available molecules,which spontaneously form bubbles.,But those bubbles have membranes,very similar to the membrane of every cell,of every living thing on Earth looks like,,like this.,And they really help molecules,,like nucleic acids, like RNA and DNA,,stay inside, develop,,change, divide,and do some of the processes that we call life. 
 Now this is just an example,to tell you the pathway,in which we are trying to answer,that bigger question about the universality of the phenomenon.,And in a sense, you can think of that work,that people are starting to do now around the world,as building a bridge,,building a bridge from two sides of the river.,On one hand, on the left bank of the river,,are the people like me who study those planets,and try to define the environments.,We don't want to go blind because there's too many possibilities,,and there is not too much lab,,and there is not enough human time,to actually to do all the experiments.,So that's what we are building from the left side of the river.,From the right bank of the river,are the experiments in the lab that I just showed you,,where we actually tried that, and it feeds back and forth,,and we hope to meet in the middle one day. 
 So why should you care about that?,Why am I trying to sell you,a half-built bridge?,Am I that charming?,Well, there are many reasons,,and you heard some of them,in the short talk today.,This understanding of chemistry,actually can help us,with our daily lives.,But there is something more profound here,,something deeper.,And that deeper, underlying point,is that science,is in the process of redefining life,as we know it.,And that is going to change,our worldview in a profound way --,not in a dissimilar way,as 400 years ago,,Copernicus' act did,,by changing the way,we view space and time.,Now it's about something else,,but it's equally profound.,And half the time,,what's happened,is it's related this kind of,sense of insignificance,to humankind,,to the Earth in a bigger space.,And the more we learn,,the more that was reinforced.,You've all learned that in school --,how small the Earth is,compared to the immense universe.,And the bigger the telescope,,the bigger that universe becomes.,And look at this image of the tiny, blue dot.,This pixel is the Earth.,It is the Earth as we know it.,It is seen from, in this case,,from outside the orbit of Saturn.,But it's really tiny.,We know that.,Let's think of life as that entire planet,because, in a sense, it is.,The biosphere is the size of the Earth.,Life on Earth,is the size of the Earth.,And let's compare it to the rest of the world,in spatial terms.,What if that,Copernican insignificance,was actually all wrong?,Would that make us more responsible,for what is happening today?,Let's actually try that. 
 So in space, the Earth is very small.,Can you imagine how small it is?,Let me try it.,Okay, let's say,this is the size,of the observable universe,,with all the galaxies,,with all the stars,,okay, from here to here.,Do you know what the size of life,in this necktie will be?,It will be the size,of a single, small atom.,It is unimaginably small.,We can't imagine it.,I mean look, you can see the necktie,,but you can't even imagine seeing,the size of a little, small atom.,But that's not the whole story, you see.,The universe and life,are both in space and time.,If that was,the age of the universe,,then this is the age of life on Earth.,Think about those oldest living things on Earth,,but in a cosmic proportion.,This is not insignificant.,This is very significant.,So life might be insignificant in size,,but it is not insignificant in time.,Life and the universe,compare to each other like a child and a parent,,parent and offspring. 
 So what does this tell us?,This tells us that,that insignificance paradigm,that we somehow got to learn,from the Copernican principle,,it's all wrong.,There is immense, powerful potential,in life in this universe --,especially now that we know,that places like the Earth are common.,And that potential, that powerful potential,,is also our potential,,of you and me.,And if we are to be stewards,of our planet Earth,and its biosphere,,we'd better understand,the cosmic significance,and do something about it.,And the good news is we can,actually, indeed do it.,And let's do it.,Let's start this new revolution,at the tail end of the old one,,with synthetic biology being,the way to transform,both our environment,and our future.,And let's hope that we can build this bridge together,and meet in the middle. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Do you ever feel completely overwhelmed,when you're faced with a complex problem?,Well, I hope to change that in less than three minutes.,So, I hope to convince you that complex,doesn't always equal complicated.,So for me, a well-crafted baguette, fresh out of the oven,,is complex,,but a curry onion green olive poppy cheese bread,is complicated.,I'm an ecologist, and I study complexity. I love complexity.,And I study that in the natural world, the interconnectedness of species. 
 So here's a food web,,or a map of feeding links between species,that live in Alpine Lakes in the mountains of California.,And this is what happens to that food web,when it's stocked with non-native fish that never lived there before.,All the grayed-out species disappear.,Some are actually on the brink of extinction.,And lakes with fish have more mosquitos, even though they eat them.,These effects were all unanticipated,,and yet we're discovering they're predictable. 
 So I want to share with you a couple key insights,about complexity we're learning from studying nature,that maybe are applicable to other problems.,First is the simple power of good visualization tools,to help untangle complexity,and just encourage you to ask questions you didn't think of before.,For example, you could plot the flow of carbon,through corporate supply chains in a corporate ecosystem,,or the interconnections of habitat patches,for endangered species in Yosemite National Park.,The next thing is that if you want to predict,the effect of one species on another,,if you focus only on that link,,and then you black box the rest,,it's actually less predictable,than if you step back, consider the entire system -- all the species, all the links --,and from that place,,hone in on the sphere of influence that matters most.,And we're discovering, with our research,,that's often very local to the node you care about,within one or two degrees.,So the more you step back, embrace complexity,,the better chance you have of finding simple answers,,and it's often different than the simple answer that you started with. 
 So let's switch gears and look at a really complex problem,courtesy of the U.S. government.,This is a diagram of the U.S. counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan.,It was front page of the New York Times a couple months ago.,Instantly ridiculed by the media,for being so crazy complicated.,And the stated goal was to increase popular support,for the Afghan government.,Clearly a complex problem,,but is it complicated?,Well, when I saw this in the front page of the Times,,I thought, "Great. Finally something I can relate to.,I can sink my teeth into this." 
 So let's do it. So here we go for the first time ever,,a world premiere view of this spaghetti diagram as an ordered network.,The circled node is the one we're trying to influence --,popular support for the government.,And so now we can look one degrees, two degrees,,three degrees away from that node,and eliminate three-quarters of the diagram outside that sphere of influence.,Within that sphere,,most of those nodes are not actionable, like the harshness of the terrain,,and a very small minority are actual military actions.,Most are non-violent and they fall into two broad categories:,active engagement with ethnic rivalries and religious beliefs,and fair, transparent economic development,and provisioning of services.,I don't know about this, but this is what I can decipher from this diagram,in 24 seconds. 
 When you see a diagram like this, I don't want you to be afraid.,I want you to be excited. I want you to be relieved.,Because simple answers may emerge.,We're discovering in nature that simplicity often lies,on the other side of complexity.,So for any problem, the more you can zoom out and embrace complexity,,the better chance you have of zooming in,on the simple details that matter most. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So I want to tell you a story -- an encouraging story --,about addressing,desperation, depression and despair in Afghanistan,,and what we have learned from it,,and how to help people,to overcome traumatic experiences,and how to help them to regain some confidence,in the time ahead -- in the future --,and how to participate again in everyday life.,So, I am a Jungian psychoanalyst,,and I went to Afghanistan in January 2004, by chance,,on an assignment for Medica Mondiale.,Jung in Afghanistan --,you get the picture.,Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world,,and 70 percent of the people are illiterate.,War and malnutrition kills people,together with hope.,You may know this from the media,,but what you may not know,is that the average age of the Afghan people is 17 years old,,which means they grow up in such an environment,and -- I repeat myself --,in 30 years of war. 
 So this translates,into ongoing violence,,foreign interests, bribery,,drugs, ethnic conflicts,,bad health, shame, fear,and cumulative traumatic experiences.,Local and foreign military,are supposed to build peace together with the donors,and the governmental and non-governmental organizations.,And people had hope, yes,,but until they realized,their situation worsens every day --,either because they are being killed,or because, somehow,,they are poorer than eight years ago.,One figure for that:,54 percent of the children under the age of five years,suffer from malnutrition. 
 Yet, there is hope.,One day a man told me,,"My future does not look brilliant,,but I want to have a brilliant future for my son.",This is a picture I took in 2005,,walking on Fridays over the hills in Kabul,,and for me it's a symbolic picture,of an open future for a young generation. 
 So, doctors prescribe medication.,And donors,are supposed to bring peace,by building schools and roads.,Military collect weapons,,and depression stays intact.,Why?,Because people don't have tools,to cope with it, to get over it.,So, soon after my arrival,,I had confirmed something which I had already known;,that my instruments come from the heart of modern Europe, yes.,However, what can wound us,and our reaction to those wounds --,they are universal.,And the big challenge,was how to understand the meaning of the symptom,in this specific cultural context.,After a counseling session, a woman said to me,,"Because you have felt me, I can feel myself again,,and I want to participate again,in my family life.",This was very important,,because the family is central,in Afghans' social system. 
 No one can survive alone.,And if people feel used, worthless and ashamed,,because something horrible has happened to them,,then they retreat, and they fall into social isolation,,and they do not dare to tell this evil,to other people or to their loved ones,,because they do not want to burden them.,And very often violence is a way to cope with it.,Traumatized people also easily lose control --,symptoms are hyper-arousal and memory flashbacks --,so people are in a constant fear,that those horrible feelings of that traumatic event,might come back unexpectedly,,suddenly,,and they cannot control it.,To compensate this loss of inner control,,they try to control the outside,,very understandably -- mostly the family --,and unfortunately,,this fits very well,into the traditional side,,regressive side, repressive side,,restrictive side of the cultural context.,So, husbands start beating wives,,mothers and fathers beat their children,,and afterward, they feel awful.,They did not want to do this, it just happened --,they lost control.,The desperate try,to restore order and normality,,and if we are not able to cut this circle of violence,,it will be transferred to the next generation without a doubt.,And partly this is already happening. 
 So everybody needs a sense for the future,,and the Afghan sense of the future,is shattered.,But let me repeat the words of the woman.,"Because you have felt me,,I can feel myself again.",So the key here is empathy.,Somebody has to be a witness,to what has happened to you.,Somebody has to feel how you felt.,And somebody has to see you and listen to you.,Everybody must be able,to know what he or she has experienced is true,,and this only goes with another person.,So everybody must be able to say,,"This happened to me, and it did this with me,,but I'm able to live with it, to cope with it,,and to learn from it.,And I want to engage myself,in the bright future for my children,and the children of my children,,and I will not marry-off my 13 year-old daughter," --,what happens too often in Afghanistan. 
 So something can be done,,even in such extreme environments as Afghanistan.,And I started thinking about a counseling program.,But, of course, I needed help and funds.,And one evening,,I was sitting next to a very nice gentleman in Kabul,,and he asked what I thought would be good in Afghanistan.,And I explained to him quickly,,I would train psycho-social counselors,,I would open centers, and I explained to him why.,This man gave me his contact details at the end of the evening,and said, "If you want to do this, call me.",At that time, it was the head of Caritas Germany. 
 So, I was able to launch a three-year project with Caritas Germany,,and we trained 30 Afghan women and men,,and we opened 15 counseling centers in Kabul.,This was our sign -- it's hand-painted,,and we had 45 all over Kabul.,Eleven thousand people came -- more than that.,And 70 percent regained their lives.,This was a very exciting time,,developing this with my wonderful Afghan team.,And they are working with me up to today.,We developed a culturally-sensitive,psycho-social counseling approach.,So, from 2008 up until today,,a substantial change and step forward,has been taking place. 
 The European Union delegation in Kabul,came into this and hired me to work,inside the Ministry of Public Health,,to lobby this approach --,we succeeded.,We revised the mental health component,of the primary health care services,by adding psycho-social care,and psycho-social counselors to the system.,This means, certainly, to retrain all health staff.,But for that, we already have the training manuals,,which are approved by the Ministry,and moreover, this approach is now part,of the mental health strategy in Afghanistan. 
 So we also have implemented it already,in some selected clinics in three provinces,,and you are the first to see the results.,We wanted to know if what is being done is effective.,And here you can see,the patients all had symptoms of depression,,moderate and severe.,And the red line is the treatment as usual --,medication with a medical doctor.,And all the symptoms,stayed the same or even got worse.,And the green line is treatment with psycho-social counseling only,,without medication.,And you can see the symptoms almost completely go away,,and the psycho-social stress has dropped significantly,,which is explicable,,because you cannot take away the psycho-social stresses,,but you can learn how to cope with them.,So this makes us very happy,,because now we also have some evidence,that this is working. 
 So here you see,,this is a health facility in Northern Afghanistan,,and every morning it looks like this all over.,And doctors usually have three to six minutes for the patients,,but now this will change.,They go to the clinics,,because they want to cure their immediate symptoms,,and they will find somebody to talk to,and discuss these issues,and talk about what is burdening them,and find solutions, develop their resources,,learn tools to solve their family conflicts,and gain some confidence in the future. 
 And I would like to share one short vignette.,One Hazara said to his Pashtun counselor,,"If we were to have met some years ago,,then we would have killed each other.,And now you are helping me,to regain some confidence in the future.",And another counselor said to me after the training,,"You know, I never knew why I survived the killings in my village,,but now I know,,because I am part of a nucleus,of a new peaceful society in Afghanistan.",So I believe this kept me running.,And this is a really emancipatory and political contribution,to peace and reconciliation.,And also -- I think --,without psycho-social therapy,,and without considering this,in all humanitarian projects,,we cannot build-up civil societies. 
 I thought it was an idea worth spreading,,and I think it must be,,can be, could be replicated elsewhere. 
 I thank you for your attention. 
 (Applause)This talk is about righting writing wrongs.,No, the sound's not faulty -- righting writing wrongs.,The Middle East is huge,,and with all our problems, one thing's for sure: we love to laugh.,I think humor is a great way to celebrate our differences.,We need to take our responsibilities seriously,,but not ourselves.,Don't get me wrong: it's not like we don't have comedy in the Middle East.,I grew up at a time when iconic actors,from Kuwait, Syria, Egypt,used laughter to unite the region,,just as football can.,(Laughter),Now is the time for us to laugh at ourselves,,before others can laugh with us.,This is the story of the rise and rise of stand-up comedy in the Middle East --,a stand-up uprising, if you will. 
 Working in London as TV maker and writer,,I quickly realized,that comedy connects audiences.,Now, the best breeding ground for good comic writing,is the stand-up comedy circuit,,where they just happen to say that you kill when you do well,and you bomb when you do badly.,An unfortunate connection for us maybe,,but it reminds me,that we'd like to thank one man for, over the past decade,,working tirelessly,to support comedians all around the world,,specifically comedians,with a Middle Eastern background.,(Applause),Like my good friends, Dean and Maysoon, at the bottom of the screen,,who, two years after 9/11,,started a festival to change the way,Middle Easterners are perceived in the world.,It's still going strong, with positive press to die for.,Also, three guys working for years in Los Angeles,,an Iranian, a Palestinian and an Egyptian,,created the aptly named Axis of Evil comedy act.,And wherever they went,,they killed. 
 Now, I didn't start this fire, but I did pour petrol on it.,I moved to Dubai as the head of original content,for a Western TV network.,My job was to connect the brand with a Middle Eastern audience.,Now, the American head of programming,wanted new local Arabic comedy.,In a thick Arabic accent, my brain went,,"Berfect.",(Laughter),Now, I had friends in the U.S.,who had started a successful new tribe.,And I had every intention of taking this tribe,from being outliers in the Middle East,and pushing them over the tipping point,towards success.,Now, as with any new idea, it wasn't easy.,I had four phases to this plan.,First, we'd need to buy content from the West and air it.,Then I'd bring my friends, and we'd show local amateurs how it's done.,We would film that and air it,,and then I could work with the local amateurs and write new comedy. 
 I excitedly presented this to the big boss,,and his reaction was, "Um, I don't get it.",So I retreated back to my cave,and continued to support and produce comedy,and let my friends use my couch,as a regional operations hub.,Now, fast forward two years, to early 2007.,The earth rotated, as did our management,,(Laughter),and as if by divine intervention,,things came together,to help this revolution take shape.,Here's how the dots connected.,First, the Axis guys recorded a Comedy Central special,that aired in the States,,and it was getting great hits on YouTube.,Our new French CEO,believed in the power of positive PR ...,(Laughter),and ideas du bon marche.,Let's just say "value for money.",I produced in Dubai a show for Ahmed Ahmed,to showcase his new Axis special to a packed room.,I invited our new CEO,,and as soon as he realized we had a room packed full of laughing infidels,,his reaction was very simple:,"Let's make this happen.,And one more thing: No, don't F it up.",So I quickly went to work,with a great team around me.,I happened to find,a funny guy to present it in Arabic,,who is originally Korean,,a perfect fit for the Axis of Evil.,This is all true. 
 Now, while preparing for the tour,,I had to remind the guys to be culturally sensitive.,I used the three Bs of stand-up don'ts,as I call them in the Middle East:,blue content, keep it clean; beliefs, not religion;,and the third B, bolitics.,Stay away from bolitics in the Middle East.,Oh course, you might think, what's left,without bolitics, sex and religion, how can you make people laugh?,I'd say, watch any successful well-written,,family-friendly sitcom in the West,for your answers. 
 Now, were the Axis successful?,In five countries, in just under a month,,we had thousands of fanatical fans come and see them live.,We had millions see them on TV and on TV news.,In Jordan, we had His Majesty the King come and see them.,In fact, they were so successful,that you could buy a pirated copy of their DVD,,even before it was released in the Middle East.,Anywhere you go.,So everywhere we went,,we auditioned amateurs.,We filmed that process and aired a documentary.,I called it "Three Guys and Wonho.",It really is his name.,And all this TV and Internet exposure,has led to a great many,recruits to our cause.,In Dubai this year, we've just had,the first all-women's, homegrown stand-up show.,And notice two of them are wearing headscarves,,and yes, even they can laugh. 
 Dubai, to me, is like a hand,that supports anyone who wants to make things happen.,20 years ago,,no one had heard of it.,Look at it now.,With an inspirational leader, I think this year,,the opening of the tallest tower in the world,is like adding a finger to that hand,,that points at all those,who spread fallacious stories about us. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Now, in three short years, we've come a long way,with stand-up comedy shows happening even in Saudi Arabia.,These comics are now going to the New York festival.,And the Lebanese, brilliant Lebanese,,Nemr Abou Nassar, we featured in our first tour,,has just been performing in L.A.'s legendary comedy clubs.,So clearly, from the inside, we are doing our best to change our image,,and it's exploding.,(Laughter),So, as for the outsiders looking in,,watch the CNN report on the second Amman Comedy Festival.,The reporter did a great job, and I thank her,,but somebody forgot to send the positive PR email,to the person operating the automatic news ticker that appears at the bottom.,For example, when Dean talks,,the ticker says, "U.S.: Suspect gave 'actionable intel.",Well, if you're used to listening to comedians,,then I'm not surprised. 
 Sadly, this leads me to another three Bs,that represents how the media in the West,talks about us as bombers, billionaires,and belly dancers.,Enough.,We're not all angry fanatics,who want to kill the infidel.,We have a positive story to tell,and image to sell.,In fact, one thing's for sure, in my experience,,we love to laugh like hell. 
 (Laughter) 
 Here are three questions that I like to use,to test the truthiness of our representation,in any media story.,One: Is the Middle East,being shown in a current time,and correct context?,(Laughter),Two: Do the Middle Eastern characters,laugh or smile,without showing the whites of their eyes?,(Laughter),Three: Is the Middle Eastern character,being played by one?,Clearly, there are wrongs that need to be righted.,We've started in our region.,My challenge to the rest of the world,is please, start using,positive Middle Eastern images in your stories.,For inspiration, go to one of our festivals,,go online, drop us a line.,Let's change the narrative together,and let's start righting writing wrongs. 
 I'd like to end, before going back to the Middle East,,with a quote from one of the greatest Sheikhs,to put quill to parchment.,As my father likes to call him, "Asheikh Azubare;",as my mother would say, "Shakespeare.",(Laughter),"And now we go in content,to liberty and not to banishment." 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Let's start with day and night.,Life evolved under conditions,of light and darkness,,light and then darkness.,And so plants and animals,developed their own internal clocks,so that they would be ready for these changes in light.,These are chemical clocks,,and they're found in every known being that has two or more cells,and in some that only have one cell. 
 I'll give you an example --,if you take a horseshoe crab off the beach,,and you fly it all the way across the continent,,and you drop it into a sloped cage,,it will scramble up the floor of the cage,as the tide is rising,on its home shores,,and it'll skitter down again right as the water is receding,thousands of miles away.,It'll do this for weeks,,until it kind of gradually loses the plot.,And it's incredible to watch,,but there's nothing psychic or paranormal going on;,it's simply that these crabs have internal cycles,that correspond, usually, with what's going on around it. 
 So, we have this ability as well.,And in humans, we call it the "body clock.",You can see this most clearly when you take away someone's watch,and you shut them into a bunker, deep underground,,for a couple of months. (Laughter),People actually volunteer for this,,and they usually come out,kind of raving about their productive time in the hole.,So, no matter how atypical these subjects would have to be,,they all show the same thing.,They get up just a little bit later every day -- say 15 minutes or so --,and they kind of drift all the way around the clock like this,over the course of the weeks.,And so, in this way we know that they are working on their own internal clocks,,rather than somehow sensing the day outside. 
 So fine, we have a body clock,,and it turns out that it's incredibly important in our lives.,It's a huge driver for culture,and I think that it's the most underrated force on our behavior.,We evolved as a species near the equator,,and so we're very well-equipped,to deal with 12 hours of daylight,and 12 hours of darkness.,But of course, we've spread to every corner of the globe,and in Arctic Canada, where I live,,we have perpetual daylight in summer,and 24 hours of darkness in winter.,So the culture, the northern aboriginal culture,,traditionally has been highly seasonal.,In winter, there's a lot of sleeping going on;,you enjoy your family life inside.,And in summer, it's almost manic hunting,and working activity very long hours,,very active. 
 So, what would our natural rhythm look like?,What would our sleeping patterns be,in the sort of ideal sense?,Well, it turns out,that when people are living,without any sort of artificial light at all,,they sleep twice every night.,They go to bed around 8:00 p.m.,until midnight,and then again, they sleep,from about 2:00 a.m. until sunrise.,And in-between, they have a couple of hours,of sort of meditative quiet in bed.,And during this time,,there's a surge of prolactin,,the likes of which a modern day never sees.,The people in these studies,report feeling so awake during the daytime,,that they realize,they're experiencing true wakefulness,for the first time in their lives. 
 So, cut to the modern day.,We're living in a culture of jet lag,,global travel,,24-hour business,,shift work.,And you know, our modern ways,of doing things,have their advantages,,but I believe we should understand the costs. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I grew up,in a very small village in Canada,,and I'm an undiagnosed,dyslexic.,I had a really hard time in school.,In fact, my mother told me eventually,that I was the little kid in the village,who cried all the way to school.,I ran away.,I left when I was 25 years old to go to Bali,,and there I met my incredible wife, Cynthia,,and together, over 20 years,,we built an amazing jewelry business.,It was a fairy tale, and then we retired.,Then she took me to see a film,that I really didn't want to see.,It ruined my life --,(Laughter),"The Inconvenient Truth" and Mr. Gore.,I have four kids,,and even if part of what he says is true,,they're not going to have the life that I had.,And I decided at that moment,that I would spend the rest of my life,doing whatever I could,to improve their possibilities.,So here's the world,,and here we are in Bali.,It's a tiny, little island --,60 miles by 90 miles.,It has an intact Hindu culture.,Cynthia and I were there.,We had had a wonderful life there,,and we decided to do something unusual.,We decided to give back,locally. 
 And here it is: it's called the Green School.,I know it doesn't look like a school,,but it is something we decided to do,,and it is extremely,,extremely green.,The classrooms have no walls.,The teacher is writing on a bamboo blackboard.,The desks are not square.,At Green School, the children are smiling --,an unusual thing for school, especially for me.,And we practice holism.,And for me it's just the idea,that, if this little girl,graduates as a whole person,,chances are,she'll demand a whole world --,a whole world --,to live on.,Our children spend 181 days,going to school in a box.,The people that built my school,also built the prison and the insane asylum,out of the same materials.,So if this gentleman,had had a holistic education,,would he be sitting there?,Would he have had more possibilities in his life? 
 The classrooms have natural light.,They're beautiful. They're bamboo.,The breeze passes through them.,And when the natural breeze isn't enough,,the kids deploy bubbles,,but not the kind of bubbles you know.,These bubbles are made from natural cotton,and rubber from the rubber tree.,So we basically turned the box,into a bubble.,And these kids know,that painless climate control,may not be,part of their future.,We pay the bill at the end of the month,,but the people that are really going to pay the bill,are our grandchildren.,We have to teach the kids,that the world is not indestructible.,These kids did a little graffiti on their desks,,and then they signed up for two extra courses.,The first one was called sanding,and the second one was called re-waxing.,But since that happened,,they own those desks.,They know they can control their world. 
 We're on the grid. We're not proud of it.,But an amazing alternative energy company in Paris,is taking us off the grid with solar.,And this thing,is the second vortex to be built in the world,,in a two-and-a-half meter drop on a river.,When the turbine drops in,,it will produce 8,000 watts of electricity,,day and night.,And you know what these are.,There's nowhere to flush.,And as long as we're taking our waste,and mixing it with a huge amount of water --,you're all really smart, just do the math.,How many people times how much water.,There isn't enough water.,These are compost toilets,,and nobody at the school wanted to know about them,,especially the principal.,And they work. People use them. People are okay.,It's something you should think about doing.,Not many things didn't work.,The beautiful canvas and rubber skylights,got eaten by the sun in six months.,We had to replace them with recyclable plastic.,The teachers dragged giant PVC whiteboards,into the classrooms.,So we had some good ideas:,we took old automobile windshields, put paper behind them,and created the first alternative,to the whiteboard. 
 Green School sits in south-central Bali,,and it's on 20 acres,of rolling garden.,There's an amazing river traveling through it,,and you can see there,how we manage to get across the river.,I met a father the other day; he looked a little crazed.,I said, "Welcome to Green School.",He said, "I've been on an airplane for 24 hours.",I asked him, "Why?",He said, "I had a dream once about a green school,,and I saw a picture of this green school,,I got on an airplane.,In August I'm bringing my sons.",This was a great thing.,But more than that,,people are building green houses around Green School,,so their kids can walk to school on the paths.,And people are bringing their green industries,,hopefully their green restaurants,,to the Green School.,It's becoming a community.,It's becoming a green model.,We had to look at everything.,No petrochemicals in the pavement.,No pavement.,These are volcanic stones laid by hand.,There are no sidewalks.,The sidewalks are gravel. They flood when it rains,,but they're green. 
 This is the school buffalo.,He's planning to eat that fence for dinner.,All the fences at Green School are green.,And when the kindergarten kids,recently moved their gate,,they found out the fence was made out of tapioca.,They took the tapioca roots up to the kitchen,,sliced them thinly and made delicious chips.,Landscaping.,We manage to keep the garden that was there,running right up to the edge of each of the classrooms.,We dropped them gently in.,We made space for these guys,who are Bali's last black pigs.,And the school cow,is trying to figure out,how to replace the lawnmower,on the playing field. 
 These young ladies,are living in a rice culture,,but they know something that few people know in a rice culture.,They know how to plant organic rice,,they know how to look after it,,they know how to harvest and they know how to cook it.,They're part of the rice cycle,and these skills will be valuable,for them in their future.,This young man is picking organic vegetables.,We feed 400 people lunch every day,and it's not a normal lunch. There's no gas.,Local Balinese women,cook the food on sawdust burners,using secrets that only their grandmothers know.,The food is incredible. 
 Green School is a place of pioneers,,local and global.,And it's a kind of microcosm,of the globalized world.,The kids are from 25 countries.,When I see them together,,I know that they're working out,how to live in the future.,Green School is going into its third year,with 160 children.,It's a school where you do learn reading --,one of my favorites --,writing -- I was bad at it --,arithmetic.,But you also learn other things.,You learn bamboo building.,You practice,ancient Balinese arts.,This is called mud wrestling in the rice fields.,The kids love it.,The mothers aren't quite convinced. 
 (Laughter) 
 We've done a lot of outrageous things in our lives,,and we said, okay, local, what does "local" mean?,Local means,that 20 percent of the population of the school,has to be Balinese,,and this was a really big commitment.,And we were right.,And people are coming forward,from all over the world,to support the Balinese Scholarship Fund,,because these kids will be Bali's next green leaders.,The teachers are as diverse,as the student body,,and the amazing thing,is that volunteers are popping up.,A man came from Java,with a new kind of organic agriculture.,A woman came from Africa with music.,And together these volunteers and the teachers,are deeply committed,to creating a new generation,of global, green leaders.,The Green School effect --,we don't know what it is.,We need someone to come and study it.,But what's happening, our learning-different kids --,dyslexic --,we've renamed them prolexic --,are doing well in these beautiful, beautiful classrooms.,And all the kids are thriving. 
 And how did we do all this?,On giant grass.,It's bamboo.,It comes out of the ground like a train.,It grows as high as a coconut tree in two months,and three years later it can be harvested,to build buildings like this.,It's as strong and dense as teak,and it will hold up any roof.,When the architects came, they brought us these things,,and you've probably seen things like this.,The yellow box was called the administration complex.,(Laughter),We squashed it, we rethought it,,but mainly we renamed it,"the heart of school,",and that changed everything forever.,It's a double helix.,It has administrators in it,and many, many other things. 
 And the problem of building it --,when the Balinese workers,saw long reams of plans,,they looked at them and said, "What's this?",So we built big models.,We had them engineered by the engineers.,And Balinese carpenters like this,measured them with their bamboo rulers,,selected the bamboo and built the buildings,using age-old techniques,,mostly by hand.,It was chaos.,And the Balinese carpenters want to be as modern as we do,,so they use metal scaffolding,to build the bamboo building,and when the scaffolding came down,,we realized that we had a cathedral,,a cathedral to green,,and a cathedral to green education.,The heart of school has seven kilometers,of bamboo in it.,From the time the foundations were finished,,in three months it had roofs and floors.,It may not be the biggest bamboo building in the world,,but many people believe,that it's the most beautiful. 
 Is this doable in your community?,We believe it is.,Green School is a model we built for the world.,It's a model we built for Bali.,And you just have to follow these simple, simple rules:,be local,,let the environment lead,and think about,how your grandchildren might build. 
 So, Mr. Gore, thank you.,You ruined my life,,but you gave me an incredible future.,And if you're interested in being involved,in finishing Green School,and building the next 50 around the world,,please come and see us. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Last year when I was here, I was speaking to you about a swim,which I did across the North Pole.,And while that swim took place three years ago,,I can remember it as if it was yesterday.,I remember standing on the edge of the ice,,about to dive into the water,,and thinking to myself, I have never ever,seen any place on this earth,which is just so frightening.,The water is completely black.,The water is minus 1.7 degrees centigrade,,or 29 degrees Fahrenheit.,It's flipping freezing in that water.,And then a thought came across my mind:,if things go pear-shaped on this swim,,how long will it take for my frozen body,to sink the four and a half kilometers,to the bottom of the ocean?,And then I said to myself, I've just got to get this thought,out of my mind as quickly as possible.,And the only way I can dive,into that freezing cold water,and swim a kilometer,is by listening to my iPod and really revving myself up,,listening to everything from beautiful opera,all the way across to Puff Daddy,,and then committing myself a hundred percent --,there is nothing more powerful than the made-up mind --,and then walking up to the edge of the ice,and just diving into the water. 
 And that swim took me,18 minutes and 50 seconds,,and it felt like 18 days.,And I remember getting out of the water,and my hands feeling so painful,and looking down at my fingers,,and my fingers were literally the size of sausages,because -- you know, we're made partially of water --,when water freezes it expands,,and so the cells in my fingers,had frozen and expanded,and burst.,And the most immediate thought when I came out of that water,was the following:,I'm never, ever,going to do another cold water swim,in my life again. 
 Anyway, last year, I heard about the Himalayas,and the melting of the -- (Laughter),and the melting of the glaciers,because of climate change.,I heard about this lake, Lake Imja.,This lake has been formed in the last couple of years,because of the melting of the glacier.,The glacier's gone all the way up the mountain,and left in its place this big lake.,And I firmly believe,that what we're seeing in the Himalayas,is the next great, big battleground,on this earth.,Nearly two billion people --,so one in three people on this earth --,rely on the water from the Himalayas.,And with a population increasing as quickly as it is,,and with the water supply from these glaciers --,because of climate change --,decreasing so much,,I think we have a real risk of instability.,North, you've got China; south, you've India, Pakistan, Bangladesh,,all these countries. 
 And so I decided,to walk up to Mt. Everest,,the highest mountain on this earth,,and go and do a symbolic swim,underneath the summit,of Mt. Everest.,Now, I don't know if any of you have had the opportunity to go to Mt. Everest,,but it's quite an ordeal getting up there.,28 great, big, powerful yaks,carrying all the equipment up onto this mountain --,I don't just have my Speedo,,but there's a big film crew who then,send all the images around the world.,The other thing which was so challenging about this swim,is not just the altitude.,I wanted to do the swim at 5,300 meters above sea level.,So it's right up in the heavens.,It's very, very difficult to breath. You get altitude sickness.,I feels like you've got a man standing behind you with a hammer,just hitting your head all the time. 
 That's not the worst part of it.,The worst part was this year was the year where they decided,to do a big cleanup operation on Mt. Everest.,Many, many people have died on Mt. Everest,,and this was the year they decided to go,and recover all the bodies of the mountaineers,and then bring them down the mountain.,And when you're walking up the mountain,to attempt to do something,which no human has ever done before, and, in fact, no fish --,there are no fish up there swimming at 5,300 meters --,When you're trying to do that,,and then the bodies are coming past you,,it humbles you,,and you also realize very, very clearly,that nature is so much more powerful,than we are. 
 And we walked up this pathway,,all the way up.,And to the right hand side of us,was this great Khumbu Glacier.,And all the way along the glacier we saw,these big pools of melting ice.,And then we got up to this small lake,underneath the summit of Mt. Everest,,and I prepared myself,the same way as I've always prepared myself,,for this swim which was going to be so very difficult.,I put on my iPod, I listened to some music,,I got myself as aggressive as possible --,but controlled aggression --,and then I hurled myself,into that water. 
 I swam as quickly as I could,for the first hundred meters,,and then I realized very, very quickly,,I had a huge problem on my hands.,I could barely breathe.,I was gasping for air.,I then began to choke,,and then it quickly led to me vomiting in the water.,And it all happened so quickly:,I then -- I don't know how it happened -- but I went underwater.,And luckily, the water was quite shallow,,and I was able to push myself off the bottom of the lake,and get up and then take another gasp of air.,And then I said, carry on. Carry on. Carry on.,I carried on for another five or six strokes,,and then I had nothing in my body,,and I went down to the bottom of the lake.,And I don't where I got it from,,but I was able to somehow,pull myself up and as quickly as possible,get to the side of the lake.,I've heard it said that drowning,is the most peaceful death that you can have.,I have never, ever heard,such utter bollocks.,(Laughter),It is the most frightening and panicky feeling,that you can have. 
 I got myself to the side of the lake.,My crew grabbed me,,and then we walked as quickly as we could,down -- over the rubble --,down to our camp.,And there, we sat down,,and we did a debrief about what had gone wrong,there on Mt. Everest.,And my team just gave it to me straight.,They said, Lewis, you need to have,a radical tactical shift,if you want to do this swim.,Every single thing which you have learned,in the past 23 years of swimming,,you must forget.,Every single thing which you learned,when you were serving in the British army,,about speed and aggression,,you put that to one side.,We want you to walk up the hill in another two days' time.,Take some time to rest and think about things.,We want you to walk up the mountain in two days' time,,and instead of swimming fast,,swim as slowly as possible.,Instead of swimming crawl, swim breaststroke.,And remember, never ever swim with aggression.,This is the time to swim,with real humility. 
 And so we walked back up,to the mountain two days later.,And I stood there,on the edge of the lake,,and I looked up at Mt. Everest --,and she is one of the most beautiful mountains on the earth --,and I said to myself, just do this slowly.,And I swam across the lake.,And I can't begin to tell you,how good I felt,when I came to the other side. 
 But I learned two very, very,important lessons there on Mt. Everest,,and I thank my team of Sherpas who taught me this.,The first one is,that just because something has worked in the past so well,,doesn't mean it's going to work in the future.,And similarly,,now, before I do anything,,I ask myself what type of mindset,do I require,to successfully complete a task.,And taking that into the world of climate change --,which is, frankly,,the Mt. Everest of all problems --,just because we've lived the way we have lived for so long,,just because we have consumed the way we have for so long,and populated the earth the way we have for so long,,doesn't mean that we can carry on,the way we are carrying on.,The warning signs are all there.,When I was born, the world's population,was 3.5 billion people.,We're now 6.8 billion people,,and we're expected to be 9 billion people,by 2050. 
 And then the second lesson,,the radical, tactical shift.,And I've come here to ask you today:,what radical tactical shift,can you take in your relationship to the environment,,which will ensure,that our children and our grandchildren,live in a safe world,and a secure world,,and most importantly, in a sustainable world?,And I ask you, please, to go away from here,and think about that one,radical tactical shift,which you could make,,which will make that big difference,,and then commit a hundred percent to doing it.,Blog about it, tweet about it, talk about it,,and commit a hundred percent,,because very, very few things,are impossible to achieve,if we really put our whole minds to it. 
 So thank you very, very much. 
 (Applause)I want you to take a trip with me.,Picture yourself driving,down a small road in Africa,,and as you drive along, you look off to the side,,and this is what you see:,you see a field of graves.,And you stop, and you get out of your car and you take a picture.,And you go into the town,,and you inquire, "What's going on here?",and people are initially reluctant to tell you.,And then someone says,,"These are the recent AIDS deaths in our community.",HIV isn't like other medical conditions;,it's stigmatizing.,People are reluctant to talk about it --,there's a fear associated with it.,And I'm going to talk about HIV today,,about the deaths,,about the stigma.,It's a medical story, but more than that, it's a social story. 
 This map depicts the global distribution of HIV.,And as you can see,,Africa has a disproportionate share of the infection.,There are 33 million people,living with HIV in the world today.,Of these, two-thirds, 22 million,are living in sub-Saharan Africa.,There are 1.4 million pregnant women,in low- and middle-income countries living with HIV,and of these, 90 percent,are in sub-Saharan Africa.,We talk about things in relative terms.,And I'm going to talk about annual pregnancies,and HIV-positive mothers.,The United States -- a large country --,each year, 7,000 mothers with HIV,who give birth to a child.,But you go to Rwanda -- a very small country --,8,000 mothers with HIV who are pregnant.,And then you go to Baragwanath Hospital,,outside of Johannesburg in South Africa,,and 8,000 HIV-positive pregnant women,giving birth --,a hospital the same as a country.,And to realize that this is just the tip of an iceberg,that when you compare,everything here to South Africa, it just pales,,because in South Africa,,each year 300,000 mothers with HIV,give birth to children. 
 So we talk about PMTCT,,and we refer to PMTCT, prevention of mother to child transmission.,I think there's an assumption amongst most people in the public,that if a mother is HIV-positive,,she's going to infect her child.,The reality is really, very different.,In resource-rich countries,,with all the tests and treatment we currently have,,less than two percent of babies are born HIV-positive --,98 percent of babies are born HIV-negative.,And yet, the reality in resource-poor countries,,in the absence of tests and treatment,,40 percent -- 40 percent of children are infected --,40 percent versus two percent --,an enormous difference.,So these programs --,and I'm going to refer to PMTCT though my talk --,these prevention programs,,simply, they're the tests and the drugs that we give to mothers,to prevent them from infecting their babies,,and also the medicines we give to mothers,to keep them healthy and alive to raise their children.,So it's the test a mother gets when she comes in.,It's the drugs she receives,to protect the baby that's inside the uterus and during delivery.,It's the guidance she gets around infant feeding,and safer sex.,It's an entire package of services,,and it works. 
 So in the United States,,since the advent of treatment in the middle of the 1990s,,there's been an 80-percent decline,in the number of HIV-infected children.,Less than 100 babies are born with HIV,each year in the United States,and yet, still,,over 400,000 children,are born every year in the world today with HIV.,What does that mean?,It means 1,100 children infected each day --,1,100 children each day, infected with HIV.,And where do they come from?,Well, less than one comes from the United States.,One, on average, comes from Europe.,100 come from Asia and the Pacific.,And each day,,a thousand babies -- a thousand babies,are born each day with HIV in Africa. 
 So again, I look at the globe here,and the disproportionate share of HIV in Africa.,And let's look at another map.,And here, again, we see,Africa has a disproportionate share of the numbers of doctors.,That thin sliver you see here, that's Africa.,And it's the same with nurses.,The truth is sub-Saharan Africa,has 24 percent,of the global disease burden,and yet only three percent of the world's health care workers.,That means doctors and nurses,simply don't have the time to take care of patients.,A nurse in a busy clinic,will see 50 to 100 patients in a day,,which leaves her just minutes per patient --,minutes per patient.,And so when we look at these PMTCT programs, what does it mean? 
 Well, back in 2001,,when there was just a simple test,and a single dose of a drug,,a nurse, in the course of her few minutes with a patient,,would have to counsel for the HIV test, perform the HIV test,,explain the results, dispense a single dose of the drug, Nevirapine,,explain how to take it, discuss infant feeding options, reinforce infant feeding,,and test the baby -- in minutes.,Well, fortunately since 2001,,we've got new treatments, new tests,,and we're far more successful,,but we don't have any more nurses.,And so these are the tests,a nurse now has to do,in those same few minutes.,It's not possible --,it doesn't work.,And so we need to find,better ways of providing care. 
 This is a picture of a maternal health clinic in Africa --,mothers coming, pregnant and with their babies.,These women are here for care,,but we know that just doing a test,,just giving someone a drug,,it's not enough.,Meds don't equal medical care.,Doctors and nurses, frankly,,don't have the time or skills,to tell people what to do in ways they understand.,I'm a doctor -- I tell people things to do,,and I expect them to follow my guidance --,because I'm a doctor; I went to Harvard --,but the reality is,,if I tell a patient, "You should have safer sex.,You should always use a condom,",and yet, in her relationship, she's not empowered --,what's going to happen?,If I tell her to take her medicines every day,and yet, no one in the household knows about her illness, so,it's just not going to work.,And so we need to do more,,we need to do it differently,,we need to do it in ways that are affordable,and accessible and can be taken to scale,,which means it can be done everywhere. 
 So, I want to tell you a story --,I want to take you on a little trip.,Imagine yourself, if you can,,you're a young woman in Africa, you're going to the hospital or clinic.,You go in for a test,and you find out that you're pregnant, and you're delighted.,And then they give you another test,and they tell you you're HIV-positive, and you're devastated.,And the nurse takes you into a room,,and she tells you about the tests,and HIV and the medicines you can take,and how to take care of yourself and your baby,,and you hear none of it.,All you're hearing is, "I'm going to die,,and my baby is going to die.",And then you're out on the street, and you don't know where to go.,And you don't know who you can talk to,,because the truth is, HIV is so stigmatizing,that if you partner, your family, anyone in your home,,you're likely to be thrown out,without any means of support.,And this -- this is the face and story,of HIV in Africa today. 
 But we're here to talk about possible solutions,and some good news.,And I want to change the story a little bit.,Take the same mother, and the nurse, after she gives her her test,,takes her to a room.,The door opens and there's a room full of mothers, mothers with babies,,and they're sitting, and they're talking, they're listening.,They're drinking tea, they're having sandwiches.,And she goes inside, and woman comes up to her and says,,"Welcome to mothers2mothers.,Have a seat. You're safe here.,We're all HIV-positive.,You're going to be okay. You're going to live.,Your baby is going to be HIV-negative." 
 We view mothers,as a community's single greatest resource.,Mothers take care of the children, take care of the home.,So often the men are gone.,They're working, or they're not part of the household.,Our organization, mothers2mothers,,enlists women with HIV,as care providers.,We bring mothers who have HIV,,who've been through these PMTCT programs,in the very facilities,,to come back and work side by side with doctors and nurses,as part of the health care team.,These mothers, we call them mentor mothers,,are able to engage women,who, just like themselves, pregnant with babies,,have found out about being HIV-positive,,who need support and education.,And they support them around the diagnosis,and educate them about how to take their medicines,,how to take care of themselves,,how to take care of their babies.,Consider: if you needed surgery,,you would want the best possible technical surgeon, right?,But if you wanted to understand,what that surgery would do to your life,,you'd like to engage someone,,someone who's had the procedure.,Patients are experts on their own experience,,and they can share that experience with others.,This is the medical care that goes beyond just medicines. 
 So the mothers who work for us,,they come from the communities in which they work.,They're hired -- they're paid as professional members of the health care teams,,just like doctors and nurses.,And we open bank accounts for them,and they're paid directly into the accounts,,because their money's protected;,the men can't take it away from them.,They go through two to three weeks,of rigorous curriculum-based education, training.,Now, doctors and nurses -- they too get trained.,But so often, they only get trained once,,so they're not aware of new medicines,,new guidelines as they come out.,Our mentor mothers get trained every single year,and retrained.,And so doctors and nurses --,they look up to them as experts.,Imagine that: a woman, a former patient,,being able to educate her doctor for the first time,and educate the other patients,that she's taking care of. 
 Our organization has three goals.,The first, to prevent mother-to-child transmission.,The second: keep mothers healthy, keep mothers alive,,keep the children alive --,no more orphans.,And the third, and maybe the most grand,,is to find ways to empower women,,enable them to fight the stigma,and to live positive and productive lives with HIV.,So how do we do it?,Well, maybe the most important engagement,is the one-to-one,,seeing patients one-to-one, educating them, supporting them,,explaining how they can take care of themselves.,We go beyond that;,we try to bring in the husbands, the partners.,In Africa, it's very, very hard to engage men.,Men are not frequently part of pregnancy care.,But in Rwanda, in one country,,they've got a policy,that a woman can't come for care,unless she brings the father of the baby with her --,that's the rule.,And so the father and the mother, together,,go through the counseling and the testing.,The father and the mother, together, they get the results.,And this is so important in breaking through the stigma. 
 Disclosure is so central to prevention.,How do you have safer sex, how do you use a condom regularly,if there hasn't been disclosure?,Disclosure is so important to treatment,,because again, people need the support of family members and friends,to take their medicines regularly.,We also work in groups.,Now the groups, it's not like me lecturing,,but what happens is women, they come together --,under the support and guidance of our mentor mothers --,they come together, and they share their personal experiences.,And it's through the sharing,that people get tactics of how to take care of themselves,,how to disclose how to take medicines.,And then there's the community outreach,,engaging women in their communities.,If we can change the way,households believe and think,,we can change the way communities believe and think.,And if we can change enough communities,,we can change national attitudes.,We can change national attitudes to women,and national attitudes to HIV.,The hardest barrier really is around stigma reduction.,We have the medicines, we have the tests,,but how do you reduce the stigma?,And it's important about disclosure. 
 So, a couple years ago, one of the mentor mothers came back,,and she told me a story.,She had been asked by one of the clients,to go to the home of the client,,because the client wanted to tell the mother and her brothers and sisters,about her HIV status,,and she was afraid to go by herself.,And so the mentor mother went along with.,And the patient walked into the house,and said to her mother and siblings,,"I have something to tell you. I'm HIV-positive.",And everybody was quiet.,And then her oldest brother stood up and said,,"I too have something to tell you.,I'm HIV-positive.,I've been afraid to tell everybody.",And then this older sister stood up and said,,"I too am living with the virus,,and I've been ashamed.",And then her younger brother stood up and said,,"I'm also positive.,I thought you were going to throw me out of the family.",And you see where this is going.,The last sister stood up and said, "I'm also positive.,I thought you were going to hate me.",And there they were, all of them together for the first time,being able to share this experience for the first time,and to support each other for the first time. 
 (Video) Female Narrator: Women come to us,,and they are crying and scared.,I tell them my story,,that I am HIV-positive,,but my child is HIV-negative.,I tell them, "You are going to make it,,and you will raise a healthy baby.",I am proof that there is hope. 
 Mitchell Besser: Remember the images I showed you,of how few doctors and nurses there are in Africa.,And it is a crisis in health care systems.,Even as we have more tests and more drugs,,we can't reach people; we don't have enough providers.,So we talk in terms of what we call task-shifting.,Task-shifting is traditionally,when you take health care services from one provider,and have another provider do it.,Typically, it's a doctor giving a job to a nurse.,And the issue in Africa,is that there are fewer nurses, really than doctors,,and so we need to find new paradigm for health care.,How do you build a better health care system?,We've chosen to redefine the health care system,as a doctor, a nurse and a mentor mother.,And so what nurses do,is that they ask the mentor mothers to explain,how to take the drugs, the side effects.,They delegate education about infant feeding,,family planning, safer sex,,actions that nurses simple just don't have time for. 
 So we go back to the prevention of mother to child transmission.,The world is increasingly seeing these programs,as the bridge to comprehensive maternal and child health.,And our organization,helps women across that bridge.,The care doesn't stop when the baby's born --,we deal with the ongoing health of the mother and baby,,ensuring that they live healthy,,successful lives. 
 Our organization works on three levels.,The first, at the patient level --,mothers and babies keeping babies from getting HIV,,keeping mothers healthy to raise them.,The second, communities --,empowering women.,They become leaders within their communities.,They change the way communities think --,we need to change attitudes to HIV.,We need to change attitudes to women in Africa.,We have to do that.,And then rework the level of the health care systems,,building stronger health care systems.,Our health care systems are broken.,They're not going to work the way they're currently designed.,And so doctors and nurses,who need to try to change people's behaviors,don't have the skills, don't have the time --,our mentor mothers do.,And so in redefining the health care teams by bringing the mentor mothers in,,we can do that. 
 I started the program in Capetown, South Africa,back in 2001.,It was at that point, just the spark of an idea.,Referencing Steven Johnson's very lovely speech yesterday,on where ideas come from,,I was in the shower at the time --,I was alone.,(Laughter),The program is now working in nine countries,,we have 670 program sites,,we're seeing about 230,000,women every month,,we're employing 1,600 mentor mothers,,and last year, they enrolled,300,000 HIV-positive pregnant women and mothers.,That is 20 percent,of the global HIV-positive pregnant women --,20 percent of the world.,What's extraordinary is how simple the premise is.,Mothers with HIV caring for mothers with HIV.,Past patients taking care of present patients.,And empowerment through employment --,reducing stigma. 
 (Video) Female Narrator: There is hope,,hope that one day,we shall win this fight,against HIV and AIDS.,Each person must know,their HIV status.,Those who are HIV-negative,must know how to stay negative.,Those who are HIV-infected,must know how,to take care of themselves.,HIV-positive pregnant women,must get PMTCT services,in order to have,HIV-negative babies.,All of this is possible,,if we each contribute to this fight. 
 MB: Simple solutions to complex problems.,Mothers caring for mothers.,It's transformational. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So yeah, I'm a newspaper cartoonist --,political cartoonist.,I don't know if you've heard about it -- newspapers?,It's a sort of paper-based reader.,(Laughter),It's lighter than an iPad,,it's a bit cheaper.,You know what they say?,They say the print media is dying --,who says that? Well, the media.,But this is no news, right?,You've read about it already. 
 (Laughter) 
 Ladies and gentlemen,,the world has gotten smaller.,I know it's a cliche, but look,,look how small,,how tiny it has gotten.,And you know the reason why, of course.,This is because of technology -- yeah.,(Laughter),Any computer designers in the room?,Yeah well,,you guys are making my life miserable,because track pads used to be round,,a nice round shape.,That makes a good cartoon.,But what are you going to do with a flat track pad,,those square things?,There's nothing I can do as a cartoonist.,Well, I know the world is flat now.,That's true.,And the Internet has reached,every corner of the world,,the poorest, the remotest places.,Every village in Africa now has a cyber cafe.,(Laughter),Don't go asking for a Frappuccino there.,So we are bridging the digital divide.,The Third World is connected,,we are connected.,And what happens next?,Well, you've got mail.,Yeah.,Well, the Internet has empowered us.,It has empowered you,,it has empowered me,and it has empowered some other guys as well. 
 (Laughter) 
 You know, these last two cartoons --,I did them live,during a conference in Hanoi.,And they were not used to that,in communist 2.0 Vietnam.,(Laughter),So I was cartooning live on a wide screen --,it was quite a sensation --,and then this guy came to me.,He was taking pictures of me and of my sketches,,and I thought, "This is great, a Vietnamese fan.",And as he came the second day,,I thought, "Wow, that's really a cartoon lover.",And on the third day, I finally understood,,the guy was actually on duty.,So by now, there must be a hundred pictures of me,smiling with my sketches,in the files of the Vietnamese police. 
 (Laughter) 
 No, but it's true: the Internet has changed the world.,It has rocked the music industry;,it has changed the way we consume music.,For those of you old enough to remember,,we used to have to go to the store,to steal it.,(Laughter),And it has changed the way,your future employer,will look at your application.,So be careful,with that Facebook account --,your momma told you, be careful.,And technology has set us free --,this is free WiFi.,But yeah, it has liberated us,from the office desk.,This is your life,,enjoy it.,(Laughter),In short, technology, the internet,,they have changed our lifestyle.,Tech guru, like this man --,that a German magazine called the philosopher of the 21st century --,they are shaping the way we do things.,They are shaping the way we consume.,They are shaping our very desires.,(Laughter),(Applause),You will not like it.,And technology has even changed,our relationship to God. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now I shouldn't get into this.,Religion and political cartoons,,as you may have heard,,make a difficult couple,,ever since that day of 2005,,when a bunch of cartoonists in Denmark,drew cartoons that had repercussions all over the world --,demonstrations, fatwa,,they provoked violence. People died in the violence.,This was so sickening;,people died because of cartoons.,I mean --,I had the feeling at the time,that cartoons had been used by both sides, actually.,They were used first by a Danish newspaper,,which wanted to make a point on Islam.,A Danish cartoonist told me he was one of the 24,who received the assignment to draw the prophet --,12 of them refused. Did you know that?,He told me, "Nobody has to tell me what I should draw.,This is not how it works.",And then, of course, they were used,by extremists and politicians on the other side.,They wanted to stir up controversy.,You know the story.,We know that cartoons can be used as weapons.,History tells us,,they've been used by the Nazis,to attack the Jews.,And here we are now.,In the United Nations,,half of the world is pushing,to penalize the offense to religion --,they call it the defamation of religion --,while the other half of the world is fighting back,in defense of freedom of speech.,So the clash of civilizations is here,,and cartoons are at the middle of it?,This got me thinking.,Now you see me thinking,at my kitchen table,,and since you're in my kitchen,,please meet my wife. 
 (Laughter) 
 In 2006, a few months after,,I went Ivory Coast --,Western Africa.,Now, talk of a divided place -- the country was cut in two.,You had a rebellion in the North,,the government in the South -- the capital, Abidjan --,and in the middle, the French army.,This looks like a giant hamburger.,You don't want to be the ham in the middle.,I was there to report on that story,in cartoons.,I've been doing this for the last 15 years;,it's my side job, if you want.,So you see the style is different.,This is more serious than maybe editorial cartooning.,I went to places like Gaza,during the war in 2009.,So this is really journalism in cartoons.,You'll hear more and more about it.,This is the future of journalism, I think. 
 And of course, I went to see the rebels in the north.,Those were poor guys fighting for their rights.,There was an ethnic side to this conflict,as very often in Africa.,And I went to see the Dozo.,The Dozo, they are the traditional hunters,of West Africa.,People fear them --,they help the rebellion a lot.,They are believed to have magical powers.,They can disappear and escape bullets.,I went to see a Dozo chief;,he told me about his magical powers.,He said, "I can chop your head off right away,and bring you back to life.",I said, "Well, maybe we don't have time for this right now.",(Laughter),"Another time." 
 So back in Abidjan,,I was given a chance to lead a workshop,with local cartoonists there,and I thought, yes,,in a context like this, cartoons can really be used as weapons,against the other side.,I mean, the press in Ivory Coast was bitterly divided --,it was compared to the media in Rwanda,before the genocide --,so imagine.,And what can a cartoonist do?,Sometimes editors would tell their cartoonists,to draw what they wanted to see,,and the guy has to feed his family, right?,So the idea was pretty simple.,We brought together cartoonists,from all sides in Ivory Coast.,We took them away from their newspaper for three days.,And I asked them to do a project together,,tackle the issues affecting their country,in cartoons, yes, in cartoons.,Show the positive power of cartoons.,It's a great tool of communication,for bad or for good.,And cartoons can cross boundaries,,as you have seen.,And humor is a good way, I think,,to address serious issues.,And I'm very proud of what they did.,I mean, they didn't agree with each other -- that was not the point.,And I didn't ask them to do nice cartoons.,The first day, they were even shouting at each other.,But they came up with a book,,looking back at 13 years,of political crisis in Ivory Coast. 
 So the idea was there.,And I've been doing projects like this,,in 2009 in Lebanon,,this year in Kenya, back in January.,In Lebanon, it was not a book.,The idea was to have --,the same principal, a divided country --,take cartoonists from all sides,and let them do something together.,So in Lebanon,,we enrolled the newspaper editors,,and we got them to publish,eight cartoonists from all sides all together on the same page,,addressing the issue affecting Lebanon,,like religion in politics and everyday life.,And it worked.,For three days, almost all the newspapers of Beirut,published all those cartoonists together --,anti-government,,pro-government,,Christian,,Muslim, of course,,English-speaking, well, you name it.,So this was a great project.,And then in Kenya, what we did,was addressing the issue of ethnicity,,which is a poison in a lot of places in Africa.,And we did video clips --,you can see them if you go to YouTube/Kenyatoons. 
 So, preaching for freedom of speech,is easy here,,but as you have seen,in contexts of repression or division,,again, what can a cartoonist do?,He has to keep his job.,Well I believe that in any context anywhere,,he always has the choice at least,not to do a cartoon,that will feed hatred.,And that's the message I try to convey to them.,I think we all always have the choice in the end,not to do the bad thing.,But we need to support,these [unclear], critical,and responsible voices,in Africa, in Lebanon,,in your local newspaper,,in the Apple store.,Today, tech companies,are the world's largest editors.,They decide what is too offensive,or too provocative for you to see.,So really, it's not about the freedom of cartoonists;,it's about your freedoms.,And for dictators all over the world,,the good news,is when cartoonists,,journalists and activists shut up. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)This strange-looking plant is called the Llareta.,What looks like moss covering rocks,is actually a shrub,comprised of thousands of branches,,each containing clusters of tiny green leaves at the end,and so densely packed together,that you could actually stand on top of it.,This individual lives in the Atacama Desert in Chile,,and it happens to be 3,000 years old.,It also happens to be a relative of parsley. 
 For the past five years, I've been researching,,working with biologists,and traveling all over the world,to find continuously living organisms,that are 2,000 years old and older.,The project is part art and part science.,There's an environmental component.,And I'm also trying to create a means,in which to step outside our quotidian experience of time,and to start to consider a deeper timescale.,I selected 2,000 years as my minimum age,because I wanted to start at what we consider to be year zero,and work backward from there. 
 What you're looking at now is a tree called Jomon Sugi,,living on the remote island of Yakushima.,The tree was in part a catalyst for the project.,I'd been traveling in Japan,without an agenda other than to photograph,,and then I heard about this tree,that is 2,180 years old,and knew that I had to go visit it.,It wasn't until later, when I was actually back home in New York,that I got the idea for the project.,So it was the slow churn, if you will.,I think it was my longstanding desire,to bring together my interest,in art, science and philosophy,that allowed me to be ready,when the proverbial light bulb went on.,So I started researching, and to my surprise,,this project had never been done before,in the arts or the sciences.,And -- perhaps naively --,I was surprised to find that there isn't even an area in the sciences,that deals with this idea,of global species longevity. 
 So what you're looking at here,is the rhizocarpon geographicum, or map lichen,,and this is around 3,000 years old,and lives in Greenland,,which is a long way to go for some lichens.,Visiting Greenland was more like,traveling back in time,than just traveling very far north.,It was very primal and more remote,than anything I'd ever experienced before.,And this is heightened by a couple of particular experiences.,One was when I had been dropped off by boat,on a remote fjord,,only to find that the archeologists I was supposed to meet,were nowhere to be found.,And it's not like you could send them a text or shoot them an e-mail,,so I was literally left to my own devices.,But luckily, it worked out obviously,,but it was a humbling experience,to feel so disconnected.,And then a few days later,,we had the opportunity to go fishing in a glacial stream,near our campsite,,where the fish were so abundant,that you could literally reach into the stream,and grab out a foot-long trout with your bare hands.,It was like visiting,a more innocent time on the planet.,And then, of course, there's the lichens.,These lichens grow only one centimeter,every hundred years.,I think that really puts human lifespans,into a different perspective. 
 And what you're looking at here,is an aerial photo take over eastern Oregon.,And if the title "Searching for Armillaria Death Rings,",sounds ominous, it is.,The Armillaria is actually a predatory fungus,,killing certain species of trees in the forest.,It's also more benignly known,as the honey mushroom or the "humongous fungus",because it happens to be,one of the world's largest organisms as well.,So with the help of some biologists studying the fungus,,I got some maps and some GPS coordinates,and chartered a plane,and started looking for the death rings,,the circular patterns,in which the fungus kills the trees.,So I'm not sure if there are any in this photo,,but I do know the fungus is down there.,And then this back down on the ground,and you can see that the fungus is actually invading this tree.,So that white material that you see,in between the bark and the wood,is the mycelial felt of the fungus,,and what it's doing -- it's actually,slowly strangling the tree to death,by preventing the flow of water and nutrients.,So this strategy has served it pretty well --,it's 2,400 years old.,And then from underground to underwater. 
 This is a Brain Coral living in Tobago,that's around 2,000 years old.,And I had to overcome my fear of deep water to find this one.,This is at about 60 feet,or 18 meters, depth.,And you'll see, there's some damage to the surface of the coral.,That was actually caused by a school of parrot fish,that had started eating it,,though luckily, they lost interest before killing it.,Luckily still, it seems to be out of harm's way,of the recent oil spill.,But that being said, we just as easily could have lost,one of the oldest living things on the planet,,and the full impact of that disaster,is still yet to be seen. 
 Now this is something that I think,is one of the most quietly resilient things on the planet.,This is clonal colony,of Quaking Aspen trees, living in Utah,,that is literally 80,000 years old.,What looks like a forest,is actually only one tree.,Imagine that it's one giant root system,and each tree is a stem,coming up from that system.,So what you have is one giant,,interconnected,,genetically identical individual,that's been living for 80,000 years.,It also happens to be male,and, in theory immortal. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is a clonal tree as well.,This is the spruce Gran Picea,,which at 9,550 years,is a mere babe in the woods.,The location of this tree,is actually kept secret for its own protection.,I spoke to the biologist who discovered this tree,,and he told me that that spindly growth you see there in the center,is most likely a product of climate change.,As it's gotten warmer on the top of the mountain,,the vegetation zone is actually changing.,So we don't even necessarily have to have,direct contact with these organisms,to have a very real impact on them. 
 This is the Fortingall Yew --,no, I'm just kidding --,this is the Fortingall Yew.,(Laughter),But I put that slide in there,because I'm often asked if there are any animals in the project.,And aside from coral,,the answer is no.,Does anybody know how old the oldest tortoise is --,any guesses?,(Audience: 300.),Rachel Sussman: 300? No, 175,is the oldest living tortoise,,so nowhere near 2,000.,And then, you might have heard,of this giant clam that was discovered,off the coast of northern Iceland,that reached 405 years old.,However, it died in the lab,as they were determining its age.,The most interesting discovery of late, I think,is the so-called immortal jellyfish,,which has actually been observed in the lab,to be able to be able to revert back to the polyp state,after reaching full maturity.,So that being said,,it's highly unlikely that any jellyfish would survive that long in the wild.,And back to the yew here.,So as you can see, it's in a churchyard;,it's in Scotland. It's behind a protective wall.,And there are actually a number or ancient yews,in churchyards around the U.K.,,but if you do the math, you'll remember,it's actually the yew trees that were there first, then the churches. 
 And now down to another part of the world.,I had the opportunity to travel around the Limpopo Province in South Africa,with an expert in Baobab trees.,And we saw a number of them,,and this is most likely the oldest.,It's around 2,000,,and it's called the Sagole Baobab.,And you know, I think of all of these organisms,as palimpsests.,They contain thousands of years,of their own histories within themselves,,and they also contain records of natural and human events.,And the Baobabs in particular,are a great example of this.,You can see that this one,has names carved into its trunk,,but it also records some natural events.,So the Baobabs, as they get older,,tend to get pulpy in their centers and hollow out.,And this can create,great natural shelters for animals,,but they've also been appropriated,for some rather dubious human uses,,including a bar, a prison,and even a toilet inside of a tree. 
 And this brings me to another favorite of mine --,I think, because it is just so unusual.,This plant is called the Welwitschia,,and it lives only in parts of coastal Namibia and Angola,,where it's uniquely adapted,to collect moisture from mist coming off the sea.,And what's more, it's actually a tree.,It's a primitive conifer.,You'll notice that it's bearing cones down the center.,And what looks like two big heaps of leaves,,is actually two single leaves,that get shredded up,by the harsh desert conditions over time.,And it actually never sheds those leaves,,so it also bears the distinction,of having the longest leaves,in the plant kingdom.,I spoke to a biologist,at the Kirstenbosch Botanical Garden in Capetown,to ask him,where he thought this remarkable plant came from,,and his thought was that,if you travel around Namibia,,you see that there are a number of petrified forests,,and the logs are all --,the logs are all giant coniferous trees,,and yet there's no sign of where they might have come from.,So his thought was that,flooding in the north of Africa,actually brought those coniferous trees down,tens of thousands of years ago,,and what resulted was this remarkable adaptation,to this unique desert environment. 
 This is what I think is the most poetic of the oldest living things.,This is something called an underground forest.,So, I spoke to a botanist at the Pretoria Botanical Garden,,who explained that certain species of trees,have adapted to this region.,It's bushfelt region,,which is dry and prone to a lot of fires,,as so what these trees have done,is, if you can imagine that this is the crown of the tree,,and that this is ground level,,imagine that the whole thing,,that whole bulk of the tree,,migrated underground,,and you just have those leaves peeping up above the surface.,That way, when a fire roars through,,it's the equivalent of getting your eyebrows singed.,The tree can easily recover.,These also tend to grow clonally,,the oldest of which is 13,000 years old. 
 Back in the U.S., there's a couple plants of similar age.,This is the clonal Creosote bush,,which is around 12,000 years old.,If you've been in the American West,,you know the Creosote bush is pretty ubiquitous,,but that being said, you see that this has,this unique, circular form.,And what's happening is it's expanding slowly outwards,from that original shape.,And it's one -- again, that interconnected root system,,making it one genetically identical individual.,It also has a friend nearby --,well, I think they're friends.,This is the clonal Mojave yucca, it's about a mile away,,and it's a little bit older than 12,000 years.,And you see it has that similar circular form.,And there's some younger clones,dotting the landscape behind it.,And both of these, the yucca and the Creosote bush,,live on Bureau of Land Management land,,and that's very different from being protected in a national park.,In fact, this land is designated,for recreational all-terrain vehicle use. 
 So, now I want to show what very well might be,the oldest living thing on the planet.,This is Siberian Actinobacteria,,which is between 400,000,and 600,000 years old.,This bacteria was discovered several years ago,by a team of planetary biologists,hoping to find clues to life on other planets,by looking at one of the harshest conditions on ours.,And what they found, by doing research into the permafrost,,was this bacteria.,But what's unique about it is that,it's doing DNA repair below freezing.,And what that means is that it's not dormant --,it's actually been living and growing,for half a million years.,It's also probably one the most vulnerable,of the oldest living things,,because if the permafrost melts,,it won't survive. 
 This is a map that I've put together of the oldest living things,,so you can get a sense of where they are; you see they're all over the world.,The blue flags represent things that I've already photographed,,and the reds are places that I'm still trying to get to.,You'll see also, there's a flag on Antarctica.,I'm trying to travel there,to find 5,000 year-old moss,,which lives on the Antarctic Peninsula. 
 So, I probably have about two more years left,on this project --,on this phase of the project,,but after five years,,I really feel like I know what's at the heart of this work.,The oldest living things in the world,are a record and celebration of our past,,a call to action in the present,and a barometer of our future.,They've survived for millennia,in desert, in the permafrost,,at the tops of mountains and at the bottom of the ocean.,They've withstood,untold natural perils and human encroachments,,but now some of them are in jeopardy,,and they can't just get up and get out of the way.,It's my hope that, by going to find these organisms,,that I can help draw attention,to their remarkable resilience,and help play a part in insuring,their continued longevity into the foreseeable future. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Today, I'm going to take you,around the world in 18 minutes.,My base of operations is in the U.S.,,but let's start at the other end of the map,,in Kyoto, Japan,,where I was living with a Japanese family,while I was doing part of my dissertational research,15 years ago.,I knew even then that I would encounter,cultural differences and misunderstandings,,but they popped up when I least expected it. 
 On my first day,,I went to a restaurant,,and I ordered a cup of green tea with sugar.,After a pause, the waiter said,,"One does not put sugar in green tea.","I know," I said. "I'm aware of this custom.,But I really like my tea sweet.",In response, he gave me an even more courteous version,of the same explanation.,"One does not put sugar,in green tea.","I understand," I said,,"that the Japanese do not put sugar in their green tea,,but I'd like to put some sugar,in my green tea.",(Laughter),Surprised by my insistence,,the waiter took up the issue with the manager.,Pretty soon,,a lengthy discussion ensued,,and finally the manager came over to me and said,,"I am very sorry. We do not have sugar.",(Laughter),Well, since I couldn't have my tea the way I wanted it,,I ordered a cup of coffee,,which the waiter brought over promptly.,Resting on the saucer,were two packets of sugar. 
 My failure to procure myself,a cup of sweet, green tea,was not due to a simple misunderstanding.,This was due to a fundamental difference,in our ideas about choice.,From my American perspective,,when a paying customer makes a reasonable request,based on her preferences,,she has every right to have that request met.,The American way, to quote Burger King,,is to "have it your way,",because, as Starbucks says,,"happiness is in your choices.",(Laughter),But from the Japanese perspective,,it's their duty to protect those who don't know any better --,(Laughter),in this case, the ignorant gaijin --,from making the wrong choice.,Let's face it: the way I wanted my tea,was inappropriate according to cultural standards,,and they were doing their best to help me save face. 
 Americans tend to believe,that they've reached some sort of pinnacle,in the way they practice choice.,They think that choice, as seen through the American lens,best fulfills an innate and universal,desire for choice in all humans.,Unfortunately,,these beliefs are based on assumptions,that don't always hold true,in many countries, in many cultures.,At times they don't even hold true,at America's own borders.,I'd like to discuss some of these assumptions,and the problems associated with them.,As I do so, I hope you'll start thinking,about some of your own assumptions,and how they were shaped by your backgrounds. 
 First assumption:,if a choice affects you,,then you should be the one to make it.,This is the only way to ensure,that your preferences and interests,will be most fully accounted for.,It is essential for success.,In America, the primary locus of choice,is the individual.,People must choose for themselves, sometimes sticking to their guns,,regardless of what other people want or recommend.,It's called "being true to yourself.",But do all individuals benefit,from taking such an approach to choice?,Mark Lepper and I did a series of studies,in which we sought the answer to this very question.,In one study,,which we ran in Japantown, San Francisco,,we brought seven- to nine-year-old Anglo- and Asian-American children,into the laboratory,,and we divided them up into three groups. 
 The first group came in,,and they were greeted by Miss Smith,,who showed them six big piles of anagram puzzles.,The kids got to choose which pile of anagrams they would like to do,,and they even got to choose which marker,they would write their answers with.,When the second group of children came in,,they were brought to the same room, shown the same anagrams,,but this time Miss Smith told them,which anagrams to do,and which markers to write their answers with.,Now when the third group came in,,they were told that their anagrams and their markers,had been chosen by their mothers.,(Laughter),In reality,,the kids who were told what to do,,whether by Miss Smith or their mothers,,were actually given the very same activity,,which their counterparts in the first group,had freely chosen. 
 With this procedure, we were able to ensure,that the kids across the three groups,all did the same activity,,making it easier for us to compare performance.,Such small differences in the way we administered the activity,yielded striking differences,in how well they performed.,Anglo-Americans,,they did two and a half times more anagrams,when they got to choose them,,as compared to when it was,chosen for them by Miss Smith or their mothers.,It didn't matter who did the choosing,,if the task was dictated by another,,their performance suffered.,In fact, some of the kids were visibly embarrassed,when they were told that their mothers had been consulted.,(Laughter),One girl named Mary said,,"You asked my mother?" 
 (Laughter) 
 In contrast,,Asian-American children,performed best when they believed,their mothers had made the choice,,second best when they chose for themselves,,and least well when it had been chosen by Miss Smith.,A girl named Natsumi,even approached Miss Smith as she was leaving the room,and tugged on her skirt and asked,,"Could you please tell my mommy,I did it just like she said?",The first-generation children were strongly influenced,by their immigrant parents',approach to choice.,For them, choice was not just a way,of defining and asserting,their individuality,,but a way to create community and harmony,by deferring to the choices,of people whom they trusted and respected.,If they had a concept of being true to one's self,,then that self, most likely,,[was] composed, not of an individual,,but of a collective.,Success was just as much about pleasing key figures,as it was about satisfying,one's own preferences.,Or, you could say that,the individual's preferences were shaped,by the preferences of specific others. 
 The assumption then that we do best,when the individual self chooses,only holds,when that self,is clearly divided from others.,When, in contrast,,two or more individuals,see their choices and their outcomes,as intimately connected,,then they may amplify one another's success,by turning choosing,into a collective act.,To insist that they choose independently,might actually compromise,both their performance,and their relationships.,Yet that is exactly what,the American paradigm demands.,It leaves little room for interdependence,or an acknowledgment of individual fallibility.,It requires that everyone treat choice,as a private and self-defining act.,People that have grown up in such a paradigm,might find it motivating,,but it is a mistake to assume,that everyone thrives under the pressure,of choosing alone. 
 The second assumption which informs the American view of choice,goes something like this.,The more choices you have,,the more likely you are,to make the best choice.,So bring it on, Walmart, with 100,000 different products,,and Amazon, with 27 million books,and Match.com with -- what is it? --,15 million date possibilities now.,You will surely find the perfect match.,Let's test this assumption,by heading over to Eastern Europe.,Here, I interviewed people,who were residents of formerly communist countries,,who had all faced the challenge,of transitioning to a more,democratic and capitalistic society.,One of the most interesting revelations,came not from an answer to a question,,but from a simple gesture of hospitality.,When the participants arrived for their interview,,I offered them a set of drinks:,Coke, Diet Coke, Sprite --,seven, to be exact. 
 During the very first session,,which was run in Russia,,one of the participants made a comment,that really caught me off guard.,"Oh, but it doesn't matter.,It's all just soda. That's just one choice.",(Murmuring),I was so struck by this comment that from then on,,I started to offer all the participants,those seven sodas,,and I asked them, "How many choices are these?",Again and again,,they perceived these seven different sodas,,not as seven choices, but as one choice:,soda or no soda.,When I put out juice and water,in addition to these seven sodas,,now they perceived it as only three choices --,juice, water and soda.,Compare this to the die-hard devotion of many Americans,,not just to a particular flavor of soda,,but to a particular brand.,You know, research shows repeatedly,that we can't actually tell the difference,between Coke and Pepsi.,Of course, you and I know,that Coke is the better choice. 
 (Laughter) 
 For modern Americans who are exposed,to more options and more ads associated with options,than anyone else in the world,,choice is just as much about who they are,as it is about what the product is.,Combine this with the assumption that more choices are always better,,and you have a group of people for whom every little difference matters,and so every choice matters.,But for Eastern Europeans,,the sudden availability of all these,consumer products on the marketplace was a deluge.,They were flooded with choice,before they could protest that they didn't know how to swim.,When asked, "What words and images,do you associate with choice?",Grzegorz from Warsaw said,,"Ah, for me it is fear.,There are some dilemmas you see.,I am used to no choice.",Bohdan from Kiev said,,in response to how he felt about,the new consumer marketplace,,"It is too much.,We do not need everything that is there.",A sociologist from,the Warsaw Survey Agency explained,,"The older generation jumped from nothing,to choice all around them.,They were never given a chance to learn,how to react.",And Tomasz, a young Polish man said,,"I don't need twenty kinds of chewing gum.,I don't mean to say that I want no choice,,but many of these choices are quite artificial." 
 In reality, many choices are between things,that are not that much different.,The value of choice,depends on our ability,to perceive differences,between the options.,Americans train their whole lives,to play "spot the difference.",They practice this from such an early age,that they've come to believe that everyone,must be born with this ability.,In fact, though all humans share,a basic need and desire for choice,,we don't all see choice in the same places,or to the same extent.,When someone can't see how one choice,is unlike another,,or when there are too many choices to compare and contrast,,the process of choosing can be,confusing and frustrating.,Instead of making better choices,,we become overwhelmed by choice,,sometimes even afraid of it.,Choice no longer offers opportunities,,but imposes constraints.,It's not a marker of liberation,,but of suffocation,by meaningless minutiae.,In other words,,choice can develop into the very opposite,of everything it represents,in America,when it is thrust upon those,who are insufficiently prepared for it.,But it is not only other people,in other places,that are feeling the pressure,of ever-increasing choice.,Americans themselves are discovering,that unlimited choice,seems more attractive in theory,than in practice. 
 We all have physical, mental,and emotional (Laughter) limitations,that make it impossible for us,to process every single choice we encounter,,even in the grocery store,,let alone over the course of our entire lives.,A number of my studies have shown,that when you give people 10 or more options,when they're making a choice, they make poorer decisions,,whether it be health care, investment,,other critical areas.,Yet still, many of us believe,that we should make all our own choices,and seek out even more of them. 
 This brings me to the third,,and perhaps most problematic, assumption:,"You must never,say no to choice.",To examine this, let's go back to the U.S.,and then hop across the pond to France.,Right outside Chicago,,a young couple, Susan and Daniel Mitchell,,were about to have their first baby.,They'd already picked out a name for her,,Barbara, after her grandmother.,One night, when Susan was seven months pregnant,,she started to experience contractions,and was rushed to the emergency room.,The baby was delivered through a C-section,,but Barbara suffered cerebral anoxia,,a loss of oxygen to the brain.,Unable to breathe on her own,,she was put on a ventilator.,Two days later,,the doctors gave the Mitchells,a choice:,They could either remove Barbara,off the life support,,in which case she would die within a matter of hours,,or they could keep her on life support,,in which case she might still die,within a matter of days.,If she survived, she would remain,in a permanent vegetative state,,never able to walk, talk,or interact with others.,What do they do?,What do any parent do? 
 In a study I conducted,with Simona Botti and Kristina Orfali,,American and French parents,were interviewed.,They had all suffered,the same tragedy.,In all cases, the life support was removed,,and the infants had died.,But there was a big difference.,In France, the doctors decided whether and when,the life support would be removed,,while in the United States,,the final decision rested with the parents.,We wondered:,does this have an effect on how the parents,cope with the loss of their loved one?,We found that it did.,Even up to a year later,,American parents,were more likely to express negative emotions,,as compared to their French counterparts.,French parents were more likely to say things like,,"Noah was here for so little time,,but he taught us so much.,He gave us a new perspective on life." 
 American parents were more likely to say things like,,"What if? What if?",Another parent complained,,"I feel as if they purposefully tortured me.,How did they get me to do that?",And another parent said,,"I feel as if I've played a role,in an execution.",But when the American parents were asked,if they would rather have had,the doctors make the decision,,they all said, "No.",They could not imagine,turning that choice over to another,,even though having made that choice,made them feel trapped,,guilty, angry.,In a number of cases,they were even clinically depressed.,These parents could not contemplate,giving up the choice,,because to do so would have gone contrary,to everything they had been taught,and everything they had come to believe,about the power,and purpose of choice. 
 In her essay, "The White Album,",Joan Didion writes,,"We tell ourselves stories,in order to live.,We interpret what we see,,select the most workable,of the multiple choices.,We live entirely by the imposition,of a narrative line,upon disparate images,,by the idea with which we have learned to freeze,the shifting phantasmagoria,,which is our actual experience.",The story Americans tell,,the story upon which,the American dream depends,,is the story of limitless choice.,This narrative,promises so much:,freedom, happiness,,success.,It lays the world at your feet and says,,"You can have anything, everything.",It's a great story,,and it's understandable why they would be reluctant,to revise it.,But when you take a close look,,you start to see the holes,,and you start to see that the story,can be told in many other ways. 
 Americans have so often tried to,disseminate their ideas of choice,,believing that they will be, or ought to be,,welcomed with open hearts and minds.,But the history books and the daily news tell us,it doesn't always work out that way.,The phantasmagoria,,the actual experience that we try to understand,and organize through narrative,,varies from place to place.,No single narrative serves the needs,of everyone everywhere.,Moreover, Americans themselves,could benefit from incorporating,new perspectives into their own narrative,,which has been driving their choices,for so long. 
 Robert Frost once said that,,"It is poetry that is lost in translation.",This suggests that,whatever is beautiful and moving,,whatever gives us a new way to see,,cannot be communicated to those,who speak a different language.,But Joseph Brodsky said that,,"It is poetry,that is gained in translation,",suggesting that translation,can be a creative,,transformative act.,When it comes to choice,,we have far more to gain than to lose,by engaging in the many,translations of the narratives.,Instead of replacing,one story with another,,we can learn from and revel in,the many versions that exist,and the many that have yet to be written.,No matter where we're from,and what your narrative is,,we all have a responsibility,to open ourselves up to a wider array,of what choice can do,,and what it can represent.,And this does not lead to,a paralyzing moral relativism.,Rather, it teaches us when,and how to act.,It brings us that much closer,to realizing the full potential of choice,,to inspiring the hope,and achieving the freedom,that choice promises,but doesn't always deliver.,If we learn to speak to one another,,albeit through translation,,then we can begin to see choice,in all its strangeness,,complexity,and compelling beauty. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Bruno Giussani: Thank you.,Sheena, there is a detail about your biography,that we have not written in the program book.,But by now it's evident to everyone in this room. You're blind.,And I guess one of the questions on everybody's mind is:,How does that influence your study of choosing,because that's an activity,that for most people is associated with visual inputs,like aesthetics and color and so on? 
 Sheena Iyengar: Well, it's funny that you should ask that,because one of the things that's interesting about being blind,is you actually get a different vantage point,when you observe the way,sighted people make choices.,And as you just mentioned, there's lots of choices out there,that are very visual these days.,Yeah, I -- as you would expect --,get pretty frustrated by choices,like what nail polish to put on,because I have to rely on what other people suggest.,And I can't decide.,And so one time I was in a beauty salon,,and I was trying to decide between two very light shades of pink.,And one was called "Ballet Slippers.",And the other one was called "Adorable.",(Laughter),And so I asked these two ladies,,and the one lady told me, "Well, you should definitely wear 'Ballet Slippers.'","Well, what does it look like?","Well, it's a very elegant shade of pink.","Okay, great.",The other lady tells me to wear "Adorable.","What does it look like?","It's a glamorous shade of pink.",And so I asked them, "Well, how do I tell them apart?,What's different about them?",And they said, "Well, one is elegant, the other one's glamorous.",Okay, we got that.,And the only thing they had consensus on:,well, if I could see them, I would,clearly be able to tell them apart. 
 (Laughter) 
 And what I wondered was whether they were being affected,by the name or the content of the color,,so I decided to do a little experiment.,So I brought these two bottles of nail polish into the laboratory,,and I stripped the labels off.,And I brought women into the laboratory,,and I asked them, "Which one would you pick?",50 percent of the women accused me of playing a trick,,of putting the same color nail polish,in both those bottles.,(Laughter),(Applause),At which point you start to wonder who the trick's really played on.,Now, of the women that could tell them apart,,when the labels were off, they picked "Adorable,",and when the labels were on,,they picked "Ballet Slippers.",So as far as I can tell,,a rose by any other name,probably does look different,and maybe even smells different. 
 BG: Thank you. Sheena Iyengar. Thank you Sheena. 
 (Applause)The global challenge that I want to talk to you about today,rarely makes the front pages.,It, however, is enormous,in both scale and importance.,Look, you all are very well traveled;,this is TEDGlobal after all.,But I do hope to take you to some places,you've never been to before. 
 So, let's start off in China.,This photo was taken two weeks ago.,Actually, one indication is that little boy on my husband's shoulders,has just graduated from high school.,(Laughter),But this is Tiananmen Square.,Many of you have been there. It's not the real China.,Let me take you to the real China.,This is in the Dabian Mountains,in the remote part of Hubei province in central China.,Dai Manju is 13 years old at the time the story starts.,She lives with her parents,,her two brothers and her great-aunt.,They have a hut that has no electricity,,no running water,,no wristwatch, no bicycle.,And they share this great splendor,with a very large pig.,Dai Manju was in sixth grade when her parents said,,"We're going to pull you out of school,because the 13-dollar school fees are too much for us.,You're going to be spending the rest of your life in the rice paddies.,Why would we waste this money on you?",This is what happens to girls in remote areas. 
 Turns out that Dai Manju was,the best pupil in her grade.,She still made the two-hour trek to the schoolhouse,and tried to catch every little bit of information,that seeped out of the doors.,We wrote about her in The New York Times.,We got a flood of donations --,mostly 13-dollar checks,because New York Times readers are very generous,in tiny amounts,(Laughter),but then, we got a money transfer,for $10,000 --,really nice guy.,We turned the money over to that man there, the principal of the school.,He was delighted.,He thought, "Oh, I can renovate the school.,I can give scholarships to all the girls,,you know, if they work hard and stay in school.,So Dai Manju basically,finished out middle school.,She went to high school.,She went to vocational school for accounting.,She scouted for jobs down in Guangdong province in the south.,She found a job, she scouted for jobs,for her classmates and her friends.,She sent money back to her family.,They built a new house,,this time with running water,,electricity, a bicycle,,no pig. 
 What we saw was a natural experiment.,It is rare to get an exogenous investment,in girls' education.,And over the years, as we followed Dai Manju, we were able to see,that she was able to move out of a vicious cycle,and into a virtuous cycle.,She not only changed her own dynamic,,she changed her household, she changed her family, her village.,The village became a real standout.,Of course, most of China was flourishing at the time,,but they were able to get a road built,to link them up to the rest of China. 
 And that brings me to my first major,of two tenets of "Half the Sky.",And that is that,the central moral challenge,of this century,is gender inequity.,In the 19th century, it was slavery.,In the 20th century, it was totalitarianism.,The cause of our time,is the brutality that so many people,face around the world because of their gender.,So some of you may be thinking,,"Gosh, that's hyperbole.,She's exaggerating.",Well, let me ask you this question.,How many of you think there are more males or more females in the world?,Let me take a poll. How many of you think there are more males in the world?,Hands up, please.,How many of you think -- a few -- how many of you there are more females in the world?,Okay, most of you.,Well, you know this latter group, you're wrong.,There are, true enough,,in Europe and the West,,when women and men,have equal access to food and health care,,there are more women, we live longer.,But in most of the rest of the world, that's not the case.,In fact, demographers have shown,that there are anywhere between 60 million,and 100 million,missing females in the current population. 
 And, you know, it happens for several reasons.,For instance, in the last half-century,,more girls were discriminated to death,than all the people killed on all the battlefields,in the 20th century.,Sometimes it's also because of the sonogram.,Girls get aborted before they're even born,when there are scarce resources.,This girl here, for instance,,is in a feeding center in Ethiopia.,The entire center was filled with girls like her.,What's remarkable is that her brothers, in the same family,,were totally fine.,In India, in the first year of life,,from zero to one,,boy and girl babies basically survive at the same rate,because they depend upon the breast,,and the breast shows no son preference.,From one to five,,girls die at a 50 percent higher mortality rate,than boys, in all of India. 
 The second tenet of "Half the Sky",is that, let's put aside the morality of all the right and wrong of it all,,and just on a purely practical level,,we think that,one of the best ways to fight poverty and to fight terrorism,is to educate girls,and to bring women into the formal labor force.,Poverty, for instance.,There are three reasons why this is the case.,For one, overpopulation is one of,the persistent causes of poverty.,And you know, when you educate a boy,,his family tends to have fewer kids,,but only slightly.,When you educate a girl,,she tends to have significantly fewer kids.,The second reason is,it has to do with spending.,It's kind of like the dirty, little secret of poverty,,which is that,,not only do poor people,take in very little income,,but also, the income that they take in,,they don't spend it very wisely,,and unfortunately, most of that spending is done by men.,So research has shown,,if you look at people who live under two dollars a day --,one metric of poverty --,two percent of that take-home pay,goes to this basket here, in education.,20 percent goes to a basket that is a combination of,alcohol, tobacco, sugary drinks --,and prostitution and festivals.,If you just take four percentage points,and put it into this basket,,you would have a transformative effect. 
 The last reason has to do,with women being part of the solution, not the problem.,You need to use scarce resources.,It's a waste of resources if you don't use someone like Dai Manju.,Bill Gates put it very well,when he was traveling through Saudi Arabia.,He was speaking to an audience much like yourselves.,However, two-thirds of the way there was a barrier.,On this side was men,,and then the barrier, and this side was women.,And someone from this side of the room got up and said,,"Mr. Gates, we have here as our goal in Saudi Arabia,to be one of the top 10 countries,when it comes to technology.,Do you think we'll make it?",So Bill Gates, as he was staring out at the audience, he said,,"If you're not fully utilizing half the resources in your country,,there is no way you will get anywhere near the top 10.",So here is Bill of Arabia. 
 (Laughter) 
 So what would some of the specific challenges,look like?,I would say, on the top of the agenda,is sex trafficking.,And I'll just say two things about this.,The slavery at the peak of the slave trade,in the 1780s:,there were about 80,000 slaves,transported from Africa to the New World.,Now, modern slavery:,according to State Department rough statistics,,there are about 800,000 -- 10 times the number --,that are trafficked across international borders.,And that does not even include those,that are trafficked within country borders,,which is a substantial portion.,And if you look at,another factor, another contrast,,a slave back then is worth,about $40,000,in today's money.,Today, you can buy a girl trafficked,for a few hundred dollars,,which means she's actually more disposable.,But you know, there is progress being made,in places like Cambodia and Thailand.,We don't have to expect a world,where girls are bought and sold or killed. 
 The second item on the agenda,is maternal mortality.,You know, childbirth in this part of the world,is a wonderful event.,In Niger, one in seven women,can expect to die during childbirth.,Around the world,,one woman dies every minute and a half from childbirth.,You know, it's not as though,we don't have the technological solution,,but these women have three strikes against them:,they are poor, they are rural,and they are female.,You know, for every woman who does die,,there are 20 who survive,but end up with an injury.,And the most devastating injury,is obstetric fistula.,It's a tearing during obstructed labor,that leaves a woman incontinent. 
 Let me tell you about Mahabuba.,She lives in Ethiopia.,She was married against her will at age 13.,She got pregnant, ran to the bush to have the baby,,but you know, her body was very immature,,and she ended up having obstructed labor.,The baby died, and she ended up with a fistula.,So that meant she was incontinent;,she couldn't control her wastes.,In a word, she stank.,The villagers thought she was cursed; they didn't know what to do with her.,So finally, they put her at the edge of the village in a hut.,They ripped off the door,so that the hyenas would get her at night.,That night, there was a stick in the hut.,She fought off the hyenas with that stick.,And the next morning,,she knew if she could get to a nearby village where there was a foreign missionary,,she would be saved.,Because she had some damage to her nerves,,she crawled all the way -- 30 miles --,to that doorstep, half dead.,The foreign missionary opened the door,,knew exactly what had happened,,took her to a nearby fistula hospital in Addis Ababa,,and she was repaired,with a 350-dollar operation.,The doctors and nurses there noticed,that she was not only a survivor,,she was really clever, and they made her a nurse.,So now, Mahabuba,,she is saving the lives,of hundreds, thousands, of women.,She has become part of the solution, not the problem.,She's moved out of a vicious cycle,and into a virtuous cycle. 
 I've talked about some of the challenges,,let me talk about some of the solutions,,and there are predictable solutions.,I've hinted at them: education,and also economic opportunity.,So of course, when you educate a girl,,she tends to get married later on in life,,she tends to have kids later on in life, she tends to have fewer kids,,and those kids that she does have,,she educates them in a more enlightened fashion.,With economic opportunity,,it can be transformative. 
 Let me tell you about Saima.,She lives in a small village outside Lahore, Pakistan.,And at the time, she was miserable.,She was beaten every single day,by her husband, who was unemployed.,He was kind of a gambler type -- and unemployable, therefore --,and took his frustrations out on her.,Well, when she had her second daughter,,her mother in-law told her son,,"I think you'd better get a second wife.,Saima's not going to produce you a son.",This is when she had her second daughter.,At the time, there was,a microlending group in the village,that gave her a 65-dollar loan.,Saima took that money,,and she started an embroidery business.,The merchants liked her embroidery; it sold very well,,and they kept asking for more.,And when she couldn't produce enough,,she hired other women in the village.,Pretty soon she had 30 women in the village,working for her embroidery business.,And then,,when she had to transport all of the embroidery goods,from the village to the marketplace,,she needed someone to help her do the transport,,so she hired her husband.,So now they're in it together.,He does the transportation and distribution,,and she does the production and sourcing.,And now they have a third daughter,,and the daughters, all of them, are being tutored in education,because Saima knows what's really important. 
 Which brings me to the final element, which is education.,Larry Summers, when he was chief economist at the World Bank,,once said that, "It may well be,that the highest return on investment,in the developing world,is in girls' education.",Let me tell you about Beatrice Biira.,Beatrice was living in Uganda,near the Congo border,,and like Dai Manju, she didn't go to school.,Actually, she had never been to school,,not to a lick, one day.,Her parents, again, said,,"Why should we spend the money on her?,She's going to spend most of her life lugging water back and forth.",Well, it just so happens, at that time,,there was a group in Connecticut,called the Niantic Community Church Group in Connecticut.,They made a donation to an organization,based in Arkansas,called Heifer International.,Heifer sent two goats to Africa.,One of them ended up with Beatrice's parents,,and that goat had twins.,The twins started producing milk.,They sold the milk for cash.,The cash started accumulating,,and pretty soon the parents said,,"You know, we've got enough money. Let's send Beatrice to school.",So at nine years of age,,Beatrice started in first grade --,after all, she'd never been to a lick of school --,with a six year-old.,No matter, she was just delighted to be in school.,She rocketed to the top of her class.,She stayed at the top of her class,through elementary school, middle school,,and then in high school,,she scored brilliantly on the national examinations,so that she became the first person in her village,,ever, to come to the United States,on scholarship.,Two years ago,,she graduated from Connecticut College.,On the day of her graduation,,she said, "I am the luckiest girl alive,because of a goat.",(Laughter),And that goat was $120. 
 So you see how transformative,little bits of help can be.,But I want to give you a reality check.,Look: U.S. aid, helping people is not easy,,and there have been books that have criticized U.S. aid.,There's Bill Easterly's book.,There's a book called "Dead Aid.",You know, the criticism is fair;,it isn't easy.,You know, people say how,half of all water well projects, a year later, are failed.,When I was in Zimbabwe,,we were touring a place with the village chief --,he wanted to raise money for a secondary school --,and there was some construction a few yards away,,and I said, "What's that?",He sort of mumbled.,Turns out that it's a failed irrigation project.,A few yards away was a failed chicken coop.,One year, all the chickens died, and no one wanted to put the chickens in there.,It's true, but we think that you don't through the baby out with the bathwater;,you actually improve.,You learn from your mistakes, and you continuously improve. 
 We also think that individuals,can make a difference, and they should,,because individuals, together,,we can all help create a movement.,And a movement of men and women,is what's needed to bring about social change,,change that will address,this great moral challenge.,So then, I ask,,what's in it for you?,You're probably asking that. Why should you care?,I will just leave you with two things.,One is that research shows,that once you have,all of your material needs taken care of --,which most of us, all of us, here in this room do --,research shows that,there are very few things in life,that can actually elevate your level of happiness.,One of those things,is contributing to a cause larger than yourself. 
 And the second thing,,it's an anecdote that I'll leave you with.,And that is the story,of an aid worker in Darfur.,Here was a woman,who had worked in Darfur,,seeing things that no human being should see.,Throughout her time there,,she was strong, she was steadfast.,She never broke down.,And then she came back to the United States,and was on break, Christmas break.,She was in her grandmother's backyard,,and she saw something that made her break down in tears.,What that was,was a bird feeder.,And she realized that she had the great fortune,to be born in a country,where we take security for granted,,where we not only can feed, clothe,and house ourselves,,but also provide for wild birds,so they don't go hungry in the winter.,And she realized that with that great fortune,comes great responsibility.,And so, like her,,you, me,,we have all won the lottery of life.,And so the question becomes:,how do we discharge that responsibility? 
 So, here's the cause.,Join the movement.,Feel happier and help save the world. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Today I want to talk to you,about ethnic conflict,and civil war.,These are not normally the most cheerful of topics,,nor do they generally generate,the kind of good news,that this conference is about.,Yet, not only is there at least some good news,to be told about fewer such conflicts now,than two decades ago,,but what is perhaps more important,is that we also have come,to a much better understanding of what can be done,to further reduce the number,of ethnic conflicts and civil wars,and the suffering that they inflict.,Three things stand out:,leadership, diplomacy,and institutional design.,What I will focus on in my talk,is why they matter, how they matter,,and what we can all do,to make sure that they continue to matter,in the right ways,,that is, how all of us can contribute,to developing and honing the skills,of local and global leaders,to make peace,and to make it last.,But let's start at the beginning. 
 Civil wars have made news headlines,for many decades now,,and ethnic conflicts in particular,have been a near constant presence,as a major international security threat.,For nearly two decades now,,the news has been bad,and the images have been haunting.,In Georgia, after years of stalemate,,we saw a full-scale resurgence of violence,in August, 2008.,This quickly escalated into a five-day war,between Russia and Georgia,,leaving Georgia ever more divided.,In Kenya, contested presidential elections in 2007 --,we just heard about them --,quickly led to high levels,of inter-ethnic violence,and the killing and displacement,of thousands of people.,In Sri Lanka,,a decades-long civil war,between the Tamil minority,and the Sinhala majority,led to a bloody climax in 2009,,after perhaps as many as 100,000,people had been killed,since 1983.,In Kyrgyzstan, just over the last few weeks,,unprecedented levels of violence occurred,between ethnic Kyrgyz,and ethnic Uzbeks.,Hundreds have been killed,,and more than 100,000 displaced,,including many ethnic Uzbeks,who fled to neighboring Uzbekistan.,In the Middle East,,conflict between Israelis and Palestinians,continues unabated,,and it becomes ever more difficult,to see how, just how,a possible, sustainable solution,can be achieved.,Darfur may have slipped from the news headlines,,but the killing and displacement there,continues as well,,and the sheer human misery that it creates,is very hard to fathom.,And in Iraq, finally,,violence is on the rise again,,and the country has yet to form a government,four months after,its last parliamentary elections. 
 But hang on, this talk is to be about the good news.,So are these now the images of the past?,Well, notwithstanding the gloomy pictures,from the Middle East, Darfur,,Iraq, elsewhere,,there is a longer-term trend,that does represent some good news.,Over the past two decades, since the end of the Cold War,,there has been an overall decline,in the number of civil wars.,Since the high in the early 1990s,,with about 50 such civil wars ongoing,,we now have 30 percent fewer,such conflicts today.,The number of people killed in civil wars,also is much lower today,than it was a decade ago or two.,But this trend is less unambiguous.,The highest level of deaths on the battlefield,was recorded between 1998 and 2001,,with about 80,000 soldiers, policemen and rebels,killed every year.,The lowest number of combatant casualties,occurred in 2003,,with just 20,000 killed.,Despite the up and down since then,,the overall trend --,and this is the important bit --,clearly points downward,for the past two decades. 
 The news about civilian casualties,is also less bad than it used to be.,From over 12,000 civilians,deliberately killed in civil wars,in 1997 and 1998,,a decade later,,this figure stands at 4,000.,This is a decrease by two-thirds.,This decline would be even more obvious,if we factored in the genocide in Rwanda,in 1994.,But then 800,000 civilians were slaughtered,in a matter of just a few months.,This certainly is an accomplishment,that must never be surpassed.,What is also important is to note,that these figures only tell part of the story.,They exclude people,that died as a consequence of civil war,,from hunger or disease, for example.,And they also do not properly account,for civilian suffering more generally.,Torture, rape and ethnic cleansing,have become highly effective,,if often non-lethal, weapons in civil war.,To put it differently,,for the civilians that suffer the consequences,of ethnic conflict and civil war,,there is no good war,and there is no bad peace.,Thus, even though every civilian killed,,maimed, raped, or tortured is one too many,,the fact that the number,of civilian casualties,is clearly lower today,than it was a decade ago,,is good news. 
 So, we have fewer conflicts today,in which fewer people get killed.,And the big question, of course,,is why?,In some cases,,there is a military victory of one side.,This is a solution of sorts,,but rarely is it one,that comes without human costs,or humanitarian consequences.,The defeat of the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka,is perhaps the most recent example of this,,but we have seen similar,so-called military solutions,in the Balkans, in the South Caucasus,and across most of Africa.,At times, they are complimented,by negotiated settlements,,or at least cease-fire agreements,,and peacekeepers are deployed.,But hardly ever do they represent,a resounding success --,Bosnia and Herzegovina,perhaps more so than Georgia.,But for many parts of Africa,,a colleague of mine once put it this way,,"The cease-fire on Tuesday night,was reached just in time,for the genocide to start on Wednesday morning." 
 But let's look at the good news again.,If there's no solution on the battlefield,,three factors can account,for the prevention of ethnic conflict and civil war,,or for sustainable peace afterwards:,leadership, diplomacy,and institutional design.,Take the example of Northern Ireland.,Despite centuries of animosity,,decades of violence,and thousands of people killed,,1998 saw the conclusion,of an historic agreement.,Its initial version was skillfully mediated,by Senator George Mitchell.,Crucially, for the long-term success,of the peace process in Northern Ireland,,he imposed very clear conditions,for the participation and negotiations.,Central among them,,a commitment,to exclusively peaceful means.,Subsequent revisions of the agreement,were facilitated by the British and Irish governments,,who never wavered in their determination,to bring peace and stability to Northern Ireland. 
 The core institutions,that were put in place in 1998,and their modifications,in 2006 and 2008,were highly innovative,and allowed all conflict parties,to see their core concerns and demands addressed.,The agreement combines a power-sharing arrangement,in Northern Ireland,with cross-border institutions,that link Belfast and Dublin,and thus recognizes,the so-called Irish dimension of the conflict.,And significantly,,there's also a clear focus,on both the rights of individuals,and the rights of communities.,The provisions in the agreement may be complex,,but so is the underlying conflict.,Perhaps most importantly,,local leaders repeatedly rose to the challenge of compromise,,not always fast,and not always enthusiastically,,but rise in the end they did.,Who ever could have imagined,Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness,jointly governing Northern Ireland,as First and Deputy First Minister? 
 But then, is Northern Ireland a unique example,,or does this kind of explanation,only hold more generally,in democratic and developed countries?,By no means.,The ending of Liberia's long-lasting civil war,in 2003,illustrates the importance,of leadership, diplomacy,and institutional design,as much as the successful prevention,of a full-scale civil war,in Macedonia in 2001,,or the successful ending,of the conflict in Aceh in Indonesia in 2005.,In all three cases,,local leaders were willing and able,to make peace,,the international community stood ready,to help them negotiate and implement an agreement,,and the institutions have lived up,to the promise that they held,on the day they were agreed. 
 Focusing on leadership, diplomacy,and institutional design,also helps explain failures to achieve peace,,or to make it last.,The hopes that were vested in the Oslo Accords,did not lead to an end,of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.,Not all the issues that needed to be resolved,were actually covered in the agreements.,Rather, local leaders committed,to revisiting them later on.,Yet instead of grasping this opportunity,,local and international leaders,soon disengaged,and became distracted,by the second Intifada, the events of 9/11,and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
 The comprehensive peace agreement for Sudan,signed in 2005,turned out to be less comprehensive than envisaged,,and its provisions may yet bear the seeds,of a full-scale return to war,between north and south.,Changes and shortcomings in leadership,,more off than on international diplomacy,and institutional failures,account for this,in almost equal measure.,Unresolved boundary issues, squabbles over oil revenues,,the ongoing conflict in Darfur,,escalating tribal violence in the south,and generally weak state capacity,across all of Sudan,complete a very depressing picture,of the state of affairs,in Africa's largest country. 
 A final example: Kosovo.,The failure to achieve,a negotiated solution for Kosovo,and the violence, tension,and de facto partition that resulted from it,have their reasons,in many, many different factors.,Central among them are three.,First, the intransigence of local leaders,to settle for nothing less,than their maximum demands.,Second, an international diplomatic effort,that was hampered from the beginning,by Western support for Kosovo's independence.,And third, a lack of imagination,when it came to designing institutions,that could have addressed the concerns,of Serbs and Albanians alike.,By the same token --,and here we have some good news again --,the very fact that there is a high-level,,well-resourced international presence,in Kosovo,and the Balkans region more generally,and the fact that local leaders on both sides,have showed relative restraint,,explains why things have not been worse,over the past two years since 2008. 
 So even in situations,where outcomes are less than optimal,,local leaders,and international leaders have a choice,,and they can make a difference for the better.,A cold war,is not as good,as a cold peace,,but a cold peace,is still better than a hot war.,Good news is also about learning the right lesson.,So what then distinguishes,the Israeli/Palestinian conflict,from that in Northern Ireland,,or the civil war in Sudan,from that in Liberia?,Both successes and failures,teach us several critically important things,that we need to bear in mind,if we want the good news to continue.,First, leadership.,In the same way in which ethnic conflict and civil war,are not natural,but man-made disasters,,their prevention and settlement,does not happen automatically either.,Leadership needs to be capable,,determined and visionary,in its commitment to peace.,Leaders need to connect to each other,and to their followers,,and they need to bring them along,on what is an often arduous journey,into a peaceful future. 
 Second, diplomacy.,Diplomacy needs to be well resourced,,sustained,,and apply the right mix of incentives and pressures,on leaders and followers.,It needs to help them reach an equitable compromise,,and it needs to ensure,that a broad coalition,of local, regional,and international supporters,help them implement their agreement. 
 Third, institutional design.,Institutional design requires,a keen focus on issues,,innovative thinking,and flexible and well-funded implementation.,Conflict parties need to move away,from maximum demands,and towards a compromise,that recognizes each other's needs.,And they need to think,about the substance of their agreement,much more than about,the labels they want to attach to them.,Conflict parties also need to be prepared,to return to the negotiation table,if the agreement implementation stalls. 
 For me personally,,the most critical lesson of all is this:,Local commitment to peace,is all-important,,but it is often not enough,to prevent or end violence.,Yet, no amount of diplomacy,or institutional design,can make up for local failures,and the consequences that they have.,Therefore, we must invest,in developing leaders,,leaders that have the skills,,vision and determination,to make peace.,Leaders, in other words,,that people will trust,and that they will want to follow,even if that means,making hard choices. 
 A final thought:,Ending civil wars,is a process that is fraught with dangers,,frustrations and setbacks.,It often takes a generation to accomplish,,but it also requires us, today's generation,,to take responsibility,and to learn the right lessons,about leadership, diplomacy,and institutional design,,so that the child soldiers of today,can become the children of tomorrow. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Sometimes I go browsing,[through] a very old magazine.,I found this observation test,about the story of the ark.,And the artist that drew this observation test,did some errors, had some mistakes --,there are more or less 12 mistakes.,Some of them are very easy.,There is a funnel, an aerial part,,a lamp and clockwork key on the ark.,Some of them are about the animals, the number.,But there is a much more fundamental mistake,in the overall story of the ark,that's not reported here.,And this problem is: where are the plants?,So now we have God,that is going to submerge Earth permanently,or at least for a very long period,,and no one is taking care of plants.,Noah needed to take two of every kind of bird,,of every kind of animal,,of every kind of creature that moves,,but no mention about plants.,Why?,In another part of the same story,,all the living creatures,are just the living creatures,that came out from the ark,,so birds, livestock and wild animals.,Plants are not living creatures --,this is the point.,That is a point that is not,coming out from the Bible,,but it's something that,really accompanied humanity. 
 Let's have a look at this nice code,that is coming from a Renaissance book.,Here we have the description,of the order of nature.,It's a nice description because it's starting from left --,you have the stones --,immediately after the stones, the plants,that are just able to live.,We have the animals that are able to live and to sense,,and on the top of the pyramid,,there is the man.,This is not the common man.,The "Homo studiosus" -- the studying man.,This is quite comforting,for people like me -- I'm a professor --,this to be over there on the top of creation.,But it's something completely wrong.,You know very well about professors.,But it's also wrong about plants,,because plants are not just able to live;,they are able to sense.,They are much more sophisticated,in sensing than animals.,Just to give you an example,,every single root apex,is able to detect and to monitor,concurrently and continuously,at least 15 different chemical,and physical parameters.,And they also are able to show and to exhibit,such a wonderful and complex behavior,that can be described just with the term of intelligence.,Well, but this is something --,this underestimation of plants is something,that is always with us. 
 Let's have a look at this short movie now.,We have David Attenborough.,Now David Attenborough is really a plant lover;,he did some of the most beautiful movies,about plant behavior.,Now, when he speaks about plants,,everything is correct.,When he speaks about animals,,[he] tends to remove the fact,that plants exist.,The blue whale,,the biggest creature that exists on the planet --,that is wrong, completely wrong.,The blue whale, it's a dwarf,if compared with the real biggest creature,that exists on the planet --,that is, this wonderful,,magnificent Sequoiadendron giganteum.,(Applause),And this is a living organism,that has a mass of at least 2,000 tons.,Now, the story,that plants are some low-level organisms,has been formalized,many times ago by Aristotle,,that in "De Anima" --,that is a very influential book for the Western civilization --,wrote that the plants are on the edge,between living and not living.,They have just a kind of very low-level soul.,It's called the vegetative soul,,because they lack movement,,and so they don't need to sense.,Let's see. 
 Okay, some of the movements of the plants are very well-known.,This is a very fast movement.,This is a Dionaea, a Venus fly trap,hunting snails --,sorry for the snail.,This has been something that has been refused for centuries,,despite the evidence.,No one can say that the plants were able to eat an animal,,because it was against the order of nature.,But plants are also able,to show a lot of movement.,Some of them are very well known, like the flowering.,It's just a question to use some techniques,like the time lapse.,Some of them are much more sophisticated.,Look at this young bean,that is moving to catch the light every time.,And it's really so graceful;,it's like a dancing angel.,They are also able to play --,they are really playing.,These are young sunflowers,,and what they are doing,cannot be described,with any other terms than playing.,They are training themselves,,as many young animals do,,to the adult life,where they will be called to track the sun,all the day.,They are able to respond to gravity, of course,,so the shoots are growing,against the vector of gravity,and the roots toward the vector of gravity.,But they are also able to sleep.,This is one, Mimosa pudica.,So during the night,,they curl the leaves,and reduce the movement,,and during the day, you have the opening of the leaves --,there is much more movement.,This is interesting,because this sleeping machinery,,it's perfectly conserved.,It's the same in plants, in insects,and in animals.,And so if you need to study this sleeping problem,,it's easy to study on plants, for example,,than in animals,and it's much more easy even ethically.,It's a kind of vegetarian,experimentation. 
 Plants are even able to communicate --,they are extraordinary communicators.,They communicate with other plants.,They are able to distinguish kin and non-kin.,They communicate,with plants of other species,and they communicate with animals,by producing chemical volatiles,,for example, during the pollination.,Now with the pollination, it's a very serious issue for plants,,because they move the pollen from one flower to the other,,yet they cannot move from one flower to the other.,So they need a vector --,and this vector,,it's normally an animal.,Many insects,have been used by plants as vectors,for the transport of the pollination,,but not just insects; even birds, reptiles,,and mammals like bats rats,are normally used for the transportation of the pollen.,This is a serious business.,We have the plants that are giving to the animals,a kind of sweet substance --,very energizing --,having in change this transportation of the pollen.,But some plants are manipulating animals,,like in the case of orchids,that promise sex and nectar,and give in change nothing,for the transportation of the pollen. 
 Now, there is a big problem,behind all this behavior that we have seen.,How is it possible to do this without a brain?,We need to wait until 1880,,when this big man,,Charles Darwin,,publishes a wonderful, astonishing book,that starts a revolution.,The title is "The Power of Movement in Plants.",No one was allowed to speak about movement in plants,before Charles Darwin.,In his book,,assisted by his son, Francis --,who was the first professor of plant physiology in the world, in Cambridge --,they took into consideration every single movement,for 500 pages.,And in the last paragraph of the book,,it's a kind of stylistic mark,,because normally Charles Darwin stored,,in the last paragraph of a book,,the most important message.,He wrote that,,"It's hardly an exaggeration,to say that the tip of the radical,acts like the brain,of one of the lower animals.",This is not a metaphor.,He wrote some very interesting letters to one of his friends,who was J.D. Hooker, or at that time, president of the Royal Society,,so the maximum scientific authority in Britain,speaking about the brain in the plants. 
 Now, this is a root apex,growing against a slope.,So you can recognize this kind of movement,,the same movement that worms, snakes,and every animal,that are moving on the ground without legs,is able to display.,And it's not an easy movement,because, to have this kind of movement,,you need to move different regions of the root,and to synchronize these different regions,without having a brain.,So we studied the root apex,and we found that there is a specific region,that is here, depicted in blue --,that is called the "transition zone.",And this region, it's a very small region --,it's less than one millimeter.,And in this small region,you have the highest consumption,of oxygen in the plants,and more important,,you have these kinds of signals here.,The signals that you are seeing here are action potential,,are the same signals,that the neurons of my brain, of our brain,,use to exchange information.,Now we know that a root apex,has just a few hundred cells,that show this kind of feature,,but we know how big,the root apparatus of a small plant, like a plant of rye.,We have almost,14 million roots.,We have 11 and a half million,root apex,and a total length of 600 or more kilometers,and a very high surface area. 
 Now let's imagine,that each single root apex,is working in network with all the others.,Here were have on the left, the Internet,and on the right, the root apparatus.,They work in the same way.,They are a network,of small computing machines,,working in networks.,And why are they so similar?,Because they evolved,for the same reason:,to survive predation.,They work in the same way.,So you can remove 90 percent of the root apparatus,and the plants [continue] to work.,You can remove 90 percent of the Internet,and it is [continuing] to work.,So, a suggestion,for the people working with networks:,plants are able,to give you good suggestions,about how to evolve networks. 
 And another possibility,is a technological possibility.,Let's imagine,that we can build robots,and robots that are inspired by plants.,Until now,,the man was inspired,just by man or the animals,in producing a robot.,We have the animaloid --,and the normal robots inspired by animals,,insectoid, so on.,We have the androids,that are inspired by man.,But why have we not any plantoid?,Well, if you want to fly,,it's good that you look at birds --,to be inspired by birds.,But if you want to explore soils,,or if you want to colonize,new territory,,to best thing that you can do is to be inspired by plants,that are masters in doing this.,We have another possibility,we are working [on] in our lab,,[which] is to build hybrids.,It's much more easy to build hybrids.,Hybrid means it's something,that's half living and half machine.,It's much more easy to work with plants,than with animals.,They have computing power,,they have electrical signals.,The connection with the machine is much more easy,,much more even ethically possible.,And these are three possibilities,that we are working on,to build hybrids,,driven by algae,or by the leaves at the end,,by the most, most powerful parts of the plants,,by the roots. 
 Well, thank you for your attention.,And before I finish,,I would like to reassure that no snails were harmed,in making this presentation.,Thank you. 
 (Applause)Just a few minutes ago, I took this picture,about 10 blocks from here.,This is the Grand Cafe here in Oxford.,I took this picture because this turns out to be,the first coffeehouse to open,in England in 1650.,That's its great claim to fame,,and I wanted to show it to you,,not because I want to give you the kind of Starbucks tour,of historic England,,but rather because,the English coffeehouse was crucial,to the development and spread,of one of the great intellectual flowerings of the last 500 years,,what we now call the Enlightenment. 
 And the coffeehouse played such a big role,in the birth of the Enlightenment,,in part, because of what people were drinking there.,Because, before the spread,of coffee and tea through British culture,,what people drank -- both elite and mass folks drank --,day-in and day-out, from dawn until dusk,was alcohol.,Alcohol was the daytime beverage of choice.,You would drink a little beer with breakfast and have a little wine at lunch,,a little gin -- particularly around 1650 --,and top it off with a little beer and wine at the end of the day.,That was the healthy choice -- right --,because the water wasn't safe to drink.,And so, effectively until the rise of the coffeehouse,,you had an entire population,that was effectively drunk all day.,And you can imagine what that would be like, right, in your own life --,and I know this is true of some of you --,if you were drinking all day,,and then you switched from a depressant to a stimulant in your life,,you would have better ideas.,You would be sharper and more alert.,And so it's not an accident that a great flowering of innovation happened,as England switched to tea and coffee. 
 But the other thing that makes the coffeehouse important,is the architecture of the space.,It was a space where people would get together,from different backgrounds,,different fields of expertise, and share.,It was a space, as Matt Ridley talked about, where ideas could have sex.,This was their conjugal bed, in a sense --,ideas would get together there.,And an astonishing number of innovations from this period,have a coffeehouse somewhere in their story. 
 I've been spending a lot of time thinking about coffeehouses,for the last five years,,because I've been kind of on this quest,to investigate this question,of where good ideas come from.,What are the environments,that lead to unusual levels of innovation,,unusual levels of creativity?,What's the kind of environmental --,what is the space of creativity?,And what I've done is,I've looked at both environments like the coffeehouse;,I've looked at media environments, like the world wide web,,that have been extraordinarily innovative;,I've gone back to the history of the first cities;,I've even gone to biological environments,,like coral reefs and rainforests,,that involve unusual levels of biological innovation;,and what I've been looking for is shared patterns,,kind of signature behavior that shows up,again and again in all of these environments.,Are there recurring patterns that we can learn from,,that we can take and kind of apply to our own lives,,or our own organizations,,or our own environments to make them more creative and innovative?,And I think I've found a few. 
 But what you have to do to make sense of this,and to really understand these principles,is you have to do away,with a lot of the way in which our conventional metaphors and language,steers us towards,certain concepts of idea-creation.,We have this very rich vocabulary,to describe moments of inspiration.,We have the kind of the flash of insight,,the stroke of insight,,we have epiphanies, we have "eureka!" moments,,we have the lightbulb moments, right?,All of these concepts,,as kind of rhetorically florid as they are,,share this basic assumption,,which is that an idea is a single thing,,it's something that happens often,in a wonderful illuminating moment. 
 But in fact, what I would argue and what you really need to kind of begin with,is this idea that an idea is a network,on the most elemental level.,I mean, this is what is happening inside your brain.,An idea -- a new idea -- is a new network of neurons,firing in sync with each other inside your brain.,It's a new configuration that has never formed before.,And the question is: how do you get your brain into environments,where these new networks are going to be more likely to form?,And it turns out that, in fact, the kind of network patterns of the outside world,mimic a lot of the network patterns,of the internal world of the human brain. 
 So the metaphor I'd like the use,I can take,from a story of a great idea that's quite recent --,a lot more recent than the 1650s.,A wonderful guy named Timothy Prestero,,who has a company called ... an organization called Design That Matters.,They decided to tackle this really pressing problem,of, you know, the terrible problems we have with infant mortality rates,in the developing world.,One of the things that's very frustrating about this is that we know,,by getting modern neonatal incubators,into any context,,if we can keep premature babies warm, basically -- it's very simple --,we can halve infant mortality rates in those environments.,So, the technology is there.,These are standard in all the industrialized worlds.,The problem is, if you buy a $40,000 incubator,,and you send it off,to a mid-sized village in Africa,,it will work great for a year or two years,,and then something will go wrong and it will break,,and it will remain broken forever,,because you don't have a whole system of spare parts,,and you don't have the on-the-ground expertise,to fix this $40,000 piece of equipment.,And so you end up having this problem where you spend all this money,getting aid and all these advanced electronics to these countries,,and then it ends up being useless. 
 So what Prestero and his team decided to do,is to look around and see: what are the abundant resources,in these developing world contexts?,And what they noticed was they don't have a lot of DVRs,,they don't have a lot of microwaves,,but they seem to do a pretty good job of keeping their cars on the road.,There's a Toyota Forerunner,on the street in all these places.,They seem to have the expertise to keep cars working.,So they started to think,,"Could we build a neonatal incubator,that's built entirely out of automobile parts?",And this is what they ended up coming with.,It's called a "neonurture device.",From the outside, it looks like a normal little thing,you'd find in a modern, Western hospital.,In the inside, it's all car parts.,It's got a fan, it's got headlights for warmth,,it's got door chimes for alarm --,it runs off a car battery.,And so all you need is the spare parts from your Toyota,and the ability to fix a headlight,,and you can repair this thing.,Now, that's a great idea, but what I'd like to say is that, in fact,,this is a great metaphor for the way that ideas happen.,We like to think our breakthrough ideas, you know,,are like that $40,000, brand new incubator,,state-of-the-art technology,,but more often than not, they're cobbled together,from whatever parts that happen to be around nearby. 
 We take ideas from other people,,from people we've learned from, from people we run into in the coffee shop,,and we stitch them together into new forms and we create something new.,That's really where innovation happens.,And that means that we have to change some of our models,of what innovation and deep thinking really looks like, right.,I mean, this is one vision of it.,Another is Newton and the apple, when Newton was at Cambridge.,This is a statue from Oxford.,You know, you're sitting there thinking a deep thought,,and the apple falls from the tree, and you have the theory of gravity.,In fact, the spaces that have historically led to innovation,tend to look like this, right.,This is Hogarth's famous painting of a kind of political dinner at a tavern,,but this is what the coffee shops looked like back then.,This is the kind of chaotic environment,where ideas were likely to come together,,where people were likely to have,new, interesting, unpredictable collisions -- people from different backgrounds.,So, if we're trying to build organizations that are more innovative,,we have to build spaces that -- strangely enough -- look a little bit more like this.,This is what your office should look like,,is part of my message here. 
 And one of the problems with this is that,people are actually -- when you research this field --,people are notoriously unreliable,,when they actually kind of self-report,on where they have their own good ideas,,or their history of their best ideas.,And a few years ago, a wonderful researcher named Kevin Dunbar,decided to go around,and basically do the Big Brother approach,to figuring out where good ideas come from.,He went to a bunch of science labs around the world,and videotaped everyone,as they were doing every little bit of their job.,So when they were sitting in front of the microscope,,when they were talking to their colleague at the water cooler, and all these things.,And he recorded all of these conversations,and tried to figure out where the most important ideas,,where they happened.,And when we think about the classic image of the scientist in the lab,,we have this image -- you know, they're pouring over the microscope,,and they see something in the tissue sample.,And "oh, eureka," they've got the idea. 
 What happened actually when Dunbar kind of looked at the tape,is that, in fact, almost all of the important breakthrough ideas,did not happen alone in the lab, in front of the microscope.,They happened at the conference table,at the weekly lab meeting,,when everybody got together and shared their kind of latest data and findings,,oftentimes when people shared the mistakes they were having,,the error, the noise in the signal they were discovering.,And something about that environment --,and I've started calling it the "liquid network,",where you have lots of different ideas that are together,,different backgrounds, different interests,,jostling with each other, bouncing off each other --,that environment is, in fact,,the environment that leads to innovation. 
 The other problem that people have,is they like to condense their stories of innovation down,to kind of shorter time frames.,So they want to tell the story of the "eureka!" moment.,They want to say, "There I was, I was standing there,and I had it all suddenly clear in my head.",But in fact, if you go back and look at the historical record,,it turns out that a lot of important ideas,have very long incubation periods --,I call this the "slow hunch.",We've heard a lot recently,about hunch and instinct,and blink-like sudden moments of clarity,,but in fact, a lot of great ideas,linger on, sometimes for decades,,in the back of people's minds.,They have a feeling that there's an interesting problem,,but they don't quite have the tools yet to discover them.,They spend all this time working on certain problems,,but there's another thing lingering there,that they're interested in, but they can't quite solve. 
 Darwin is a great example of this.,Darwin himself, in his autobiography,,tells the story of coming up with the idea,for natural selection,as a classic "eureka!" moment.,He's in his study,,it's October of 1838,,and he's reading Malthus, actually, on population.,And all of a sudden,,the basic algorithm of natural selection kind of pops into his head,and he says, "Ah, at last, I had a theory with which to work.",That's in his autobiography.,About a decade or two ago,,a wonderful scholar named Howard Gruber went back,and looked at Darwin's notebooks from this period.,And Darwin kept these copious notebooks,where he wrote down every little idea he had, every little hunch.,And what Gruber found was,that Darwin had the full theory of natural selection,for months and months and months,before he had his alleged epiphany,,reading Malthus in October of 1838.,There are passages where you can read it,,and you think you're reading from a Darwin textbook,,from the period before he has this epiphany.,And so what you realize is that Darwin, in a sense,,had the idea, he had the concept,,but was unable of fully thinking it yet.,And that is actually how great ideas often happen;,they fade into view over long periods of time. 
 Now the challenge for all of us is:,how do you create environments,that allow these ideas to have this kind of long half-life, right?,It's hard to go to your boss and say,,"I have an excellent idea for our organization.,It will be useful in 2020.,Could you just give me some time to do that?",Now a couple of companies -- like Google --,they have innovation time off, 20 percent time,,where, in a sense, those are hunch-cultivating mechanisms in an organization.,But that's a key thing.,And the other thing is to allow those hunches,to connect with other people's hunches; that's what often happens.,You have half of an idea, somebody else has the other half,,and if you're in the right environment,,they turn into something larger than the sum of their parts.,So, in a sense,,we often talk about the value,of protecting intellectual property,,you know, building barricades,,having secretive R&D labs, patenting everything that we have,,so that those ideas will remain valuable,,and people will be incentivized to come up with more ideas,,and the culture will be more innovative.,But I think there's a case to be made,that we should spend at least as much time, if not more,,valuing the premise of connecting ideas,and not just protecting them. 
 And I'll leave you with this story,,which I think captures a lot of these values,,and it's just wonderful kind of tale of innovation,and how it happens in unlikely ways.,It's October of 1957,,and Sputnik has just launched,,and we're in Laurel Maryland,,at the applied physics lab,associated with Johns Hopkins University.,And it's Monday morning,,and the news has just broken about this satellite,that's now orbiting the planet.,And of course, this is nerd heaven, right?,There are all these physics geeks who are there thinking,,"Oh my gosh! This is incredible. I can't believe this has happened.",And two of them,,two 20-something researchers at the APL,are there at the cafeteria table,having an informal conversation with a bunch of their colleagues.,And these two guys are named Guier and Weiffenbach.,And they start talking, and one of them says,,"Hey, has anybody tried to listen for this thing?,There's this, you know, man-made satellite up there in outer space,that's obviously broadcasting some kind of signal.,We could probably hear it, if we tune in.",And so they ask around to a couple of their colleagues,,and everybody's like, "No, I hadn't thought of doing that.,That's an interesting idea." 
 And it turns out Weiffenbach is kind of an expert,in microwave reception,,and he's got a little antennae set up,with an amplifier in his office.,And so Guier and Weiffenbach go back to Weiffenbach's office,,and they start kind of noodling around -- hacking, as we might call it now.,And after a couple of hours, they actually start picking up the signal,,because the Soviets made Sputnik,very easy to track.,It was right at 20 MHz, so you could pick it up really easily,,because they were afraid that people would think it was a hoax, basically.,So they made it really easy to find it. 
 So these two guys are sitting there listening to this signal,,and people start kind of coming into the office and saying,,"Wow, that's pretty cool. Can I hear? Wow, that's great.",And before long, they think, "Well jeez, this is kind of historic.,We may be the first people in the United States to be listening to this.,We should record it.",And so they bring in this big, clunky analog tape recorder,and they start recording these little bleep, bleeps.,And they start writing the kind of date stamp, time stamps,for each little bleep that they record.,And they they start thinking, "Well gosh, you know, we're noticing,small little frequency variations here.,We could probably calculate the speed,that the satellite is traveling,,if we do a little basic math here,using the Doppler effect.",And then they played around with it a little bit more,,and they talked to a couple of their colleagues,who had other kind of specialties.,And they said, "Jeez, you know,,we think we could actually take a look at the slope of the Doppler effect,to figure out the points at which,the satellite is closest to our antennae,and the points at which it's farthest away.,That's pretty cool." 
 And eventually, they get permission --,this is all a little side project that hadn't been officially part of their job description.,They get permission to use the new, you know, UNIVAC computer,that takes up an entire room that they'd just gotten at the APL.,They run some more of the numbers, and at the end of about three or four weeks,,turns out they have mapped the exact trajectory,of this satellite around the Earth,,just from listening to this one little signal,,going off on this little side hunch that they'd been inspired to do,over lunch one morning. 
 A couple weeks later their boss, Frank McClure,,pulls them into the room and says,,"Hey, you guys, I have to ask you something,about that project you were working on.,You've figured out an unknown location,of a satellite orbiting the planet,from a known location on the ground.,Could you go the other way?,Could you figure out an unknown location on the ground,,if you knew the location of the satellite?",And they thought about it and they said,,"Well, I guess maybe you could. Let's run the numbers here.",So they went back, and they thought about it.,And they came back and said, "Actually, it'll be easier.",And he said, "Oh, that's great.,Because see, I have these new nuclear submarines,that I'm building.,And it's really hard to figure out how to get your missile,so that it will land right on top of Moscow,,if you don't know where the submarine is in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.,So we're thinking, we could throw up a bunch of satellites,and use it to track our submarines,and figure out their location in the middle of the ocean.,Could you work on that problem?" 
 And that's how GPS was born.,30 years later,,Ronald Reagan actually opened it up and made it an open platform,that anybody could kind of build upon,and anybody could come along and build new technology,that would create and innovate,on top of this open platform,,left it open for anyone to do,pretty much anything they wanted with it.,And now, I guarantee you,certainly half of this room, if not more,,has a device sitting in their pocket right now,that is talking to one of these satellites in outer space.,And I bet you one of you, if not more,,has used said device and said satellite system,to locate a nearby coffeehouse somewhere in the last --,(Laughter),in the last day or last week, right? 
 (Applause) 
 And that, I think,,is a great case study, a great lesson,in the power, the marvelous, kind of unplanned,emergent, unpredictable power,of open innovative systems.,When you build them right, they will be led to completely new directions,that the creators never even dreamed of.,I mean, here you have these guys,who basically thought they were just following this hunch,,this little passion that had developed,,then they thought they were fighting the Cold War,,and then it turns out they're just helping somebody,find a soy latte. 
 (Laughter) 
 That is how innovation happens.,Chance favors the connected mind. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Well, that's kind of an obvious statement up there.,I started with that sentence about 12 years ago,,and I started in the context,of developing countries,,but you're sitting here from every corner of the world.,So if you think of a map of your country,,I think you'll realize,that for every country on Earth,,you could draw little circles to say,,"These are places where good teachers won't go.",On top of that,,those are the places from where trouble comes.,So we have an ironic problem --,good teachers don't want to go,to just those places where they're needed the most. 
 I started in 1999,to try and address this problem with an experiment,,which was a very simple experiment in New Delhi.,I basically embedded a computer,into a wall of a slum in New Delhi.,The children barely went to school, they didn't know any English --,they'd never seen a computer before,,and they didn't know what the internet was.,I connected high speed internet to it -- it's about three feet off the ground --,turned it on and left it there.,After this,,we noticed a couple of interesting things, which you'll see.,But I repeated this all over India,and then through,a large part of the world,and noticed,that children will learn to do,what they want to learn to do. 
 This is the first experiment that we did --,eight year-old boy on your right,teaching his student, a six year-old girl,,and he was teaching her how to browse.,This boy here in the middle of central India --,this is in a Rajasthan village,,where the children recorded their own music,and then played it back to each other,and in the process,,they've enjoyed themselves thoroughly.,They did all of this in four hours,after seeing the computer for the first time.,In another South Indian village,,these boys here,had assembled a video camera,and were trying to take the photograph of a bumble bee.,They downloaded it from Disney.com,,or one of these websites,,14 days after putting the computer in their village.,So at the end of it,,we concluded that groups of children,can learn to use computers and the internet on their own,,irrespective of who,or where they were. 
 At that point, I became a little more ambitious,and decided to see,what else could children do with a computer.,We started off with an experiment in Hyderabad, India,,where I gave a group of children --,they spoke English with a very strong Telugu accent.,I gave them a computer,with a speech-to-text interface,,which you now get free with Windows,,and asked them to speak into it.,So when they spoke into it,,the computer typed out gibberish,,so they said, "Well, it doesn't understand anything of what we are saying.",So I said, "Yeah, I'll leave it here for two months.,Make yourself understood,to the computer.",So the children said, "How do we do that.",And I said,,"I don't know, actually.",(Laughter),And I left.,(Laughter),Two months later --,and this is now documented,in the Information Technology,for International Development journal --,that accents had changed,and were remarkably close to the neutral British accent,in which I had trained the speech-to-text synthesizer.,In other words, they were all speaking like James Tooley.,(Laughter),So they could do that on their own.,After that, I started to experiment,with various other things,that they might learn to do on their own. 
 I got an interesting phone call once from Columbo,,from the late Arthur C. Clarke,,who said, "I want to see what's going on.",And he couldn't travel, so I went over there.,He said two interesting things,,"A teacher that can be replaced by a machine should be.",(Laughter),The second thing he said was that,,"If children have interest,,then education happens.",And I was doing that in the field,,so every time I would watch it and think of him. 
 (Video) Arthur C. Clarke: And they can definitely,help people,,because children quickly learn to navigate,the web and find things which interest them.,And when you've got interest, then you have education. 
 Sugata Mitra: I took the experiment to South Africa.,This is a 15 year-old boy. 
 (Video) Boy: ... just mention, I play games,like animals,,and I listen to music. 
 SM: And I asked him, "Do you send emails?",And he said, "Yes, and they hop across the ocean.",This is in Cambodia,,rural Cambodia --,a fairly silly arithmetic game,,which no child would play inside the classroom or at home.,They would, you know, throw it back at you.,They'd say, "This is very boring.",If you leave it on the pavement,and if all the adults go away,,then they will show off with each other,about what they can do.,This is what these children are doing.,They are trying to multiply, I think.,And all over India,,at the end of about two years,,children were beginning to Google their homework.,As a result, the teachers reported,tremendous improvements in their English --,(Laughter),rapid improvement and all sorts of things.,They said, "They have become really deep thinkers and so on and so forth.,(Laughter),And indeed they had.,I mean, if there's stuff on Google,,why would you need to stuff it into your head?,So at the end of the next four years,,I decided that groups of children can navigate the internet,to achieve educational objectives on their own. 
 At that time, a large amount of money,had come into Newcastle University,to improve schooling in India.,So Newcastle gave me a call. I said, "I'll do it from Delhi.",They said, "There's no way you're going to handle,a million pounds-worth of University money,sitting in Delhi.",So in 2006,,I bought myself a heavy overcoat,and moved to Newcastle.,I wanted to test the limits,of the system.,The first experiment I did out of Newcastle,was actually done in India.,And I set myself and impossible target:,can Tamil speaking,12-year-old children,in a South Indian village,teach themselves biotechnology,in English on their own?,And I thought, I'll test them, they'll get a zero --,I'll give the materials, I'll come back and test them --,they get another zero,,I'll go back and say, "Yes, we need teachers for certain things." 
 I called in 26 children.,They all came in there, and I told them,that there's some really difficult stuff on this computer.,I wouldn't be surprised if you didn't understand anything.,It's all in English, and I'm going.,(Laughter),So I left them with it.,I came back after two months,,and the 26 children marched in looking very, very quiet.,I said, "Well, did you look at any of the stuff?",They said, "Yes, we did.","Did you understand anything?" "No, nothing.",So I said,,"Well, how long did you practice on it,before you decided you understood nothing?",They said, "We look at it every day.",So I said, "For two months, you were looking at stuff you didn't understand?",So a 12 year-old girl raises her hand and says,,literally,,"Apart from the fact that improper replication of the DNA molecule,causes genetic disease,,we've understood nothing else." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 (Laughter) 
 It took me three years to publish that.,It's just been published in the British Journal of Educational Technology.,One of the referees who refereed the paper said,,"It's too good to be true,",which was not very nice.,Well, one of the girls had taught herself,to become the teacher.,And then that's her over there.,Remember, they don't study English.,I edited out the last bit when I asked, "Where is the neuron?",and she says, "The neuron? The neuron,",and then she looked and did this.,Whatever the expression, it was not very nice. 
 So their scores had gone up from zero to 30 percent,,which is an educational impossibility under the circumstances.,But 30 percent is not a pass.,So I found that they had a friend,,a local accountant, a young girl,,and they played football with her.,I asked that girl, "Would you teach them,enough biotechnology to pass?",And she said, "How would I do that? I don't know the subject.",I said, "No, use the method of the grandmother.",She said, "What's that?",I said, "Well, what you've got to do,is stand behind them,and admire them all the time.,Just say to them, 'That's cool. That's fantastic.,What is that? Can you do that again? Can you show me some more?'",She did that for two months.,The scores went up to 50,,which is what the posh schools of New Delhi,,with a trained biotechnology teacher were getting. 
 So I came back to Newcastle,with these results,and decided,that there was something happening here,that definitely was getting very serious.,So, having experimented in all sorts of remote places,,I came to the most remote place that I could think of.,(Laughter),Approximately 5,000 miles from Delhi,is the little town of Gateshead.,In Gateshead, I took 32 children,and I started to fine-tune the method.,I made them into groups of four.,I said, "You make your own groups of four.,Each group of four can use one computer and not four computers.",Remember, from the Hole in the Wall.,"You can exchange groups.,You can walk across to another group,,if you don't like your group, etc.,You can go to another group, peer over their shoulders, see what they're doing,,come back to you own group and claim it as your own work.",And I explained to them,that, you know, a lot of scientific research is done using that method. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 The children enthusiastically got after me and said,,"Now, what do you want us to do?",I gave them six GCSE questions.,The first group -- the best one --,solved everything in 20 minutes.,The worst, in 45.,They used everything that they knew --,news groups, Google, Wikipedia,,Ask Jeeves, etc.,The teachers said, "Is this deep learning?",I said, "Well, let's try it.,I'll come back after two months.,We'll give them a paper test --,no computers, no talking to each other, etc.",The average score when I'd done it with the computers and the groups,was 76 percent.,When I did the experiment, when I did the test,,after two months, the score,was 76 percent.,There was photographic recall,inside the children,,I suspect because they're discussing with each other.,A single child in front of a single computer,will not do that.,I have further results,,which are almost unbelievable,,of scores which go up with time.,Because their teachers say,that after the session is over,,the children continue to Google further. 
 Here in Britain, I put out a call,for British grandmothers,,after my Kuppam experiment.,Well, you know,,they're very vigorous people, British grandmothers.,200 of them volunteered immediately.,(Laughter),The deal was that they would give me,one hour of broadband time,,sitting in their homes,,one day in a week.,So they did that,,and over the last two years,,over 600 hours of instruction,has happened over Skype,,using what my students call the granny cloud.,The granny cloud sits over there.,I can beam them to whichever school I want to. 
 (Video) Teacher: You can't catch me.,You say it.,You can't catch me. 
 Children: You can't catch me. 
 Teacher: I'm the gingerbread man. 
 Children: I'm the gingerbread man. 
 Teacher: Well done. Very good ... 
 SM: Back at Gateshead,,a 10-year-old girl gets into the heart of Hinduism,in 15 minutes.,You know, stuff which I don't know anything about.,Two children watch a TEDTalk.,They wanted to be footballers before.,After watching eight TEDTalks,,he wants to become Leonardo da Vinci. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 It's pretty simple stuff. 
 This is what I'm building now --,they're called SOLEs: Self Organized Learning Environments.,The furniture is designed,so that children can sit in front of big, powerful screens,,big broadband connections, but in groups.,If they want, they can call the granny cloud.,This is a SOLE in Newcastle.,The mediator is from Pune, India. 
 So how far can we go? One last little bit and I'll stop.,I went to Turin in May.,I sent all the teachers away from my group of 10 year-old students.,I speak only English, they speak only Italian,,so we had no way to communicate.,I started writing English questions on the blackboard.,The children looked at it and said, "What?",I said, "Well, do it.",They typed it into Google, translated it into Italian,,went back into Italian Google.,Fifteen minutes later --,next question: where is Calcutta?,This one, they took only 10 minutes.,I tried a really hard one then.,Who was Pythagoras, and what did he do?,There was silence for a while,,then they said, "You've spelled it wrong.,It's Pitagora.",And then,,in 20 minutes,,the right-angled triangles began to appear on the screens.,This sent shivers up my spine.,These are 10 year-olds.,Text: In another 30 minutes they would reach the Theory of Relativity. And then? 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 SM: So you know what's happened?,I think we've just stumbled across,a self-organizing system.,A self-organizing system is one,where a structure appears,without explicit intervention from the outside.,Self-organizing systems also always show emergence,,which is that the system starts to do things,,which it was never designed for.,Which is why you react the way you do,,because it looks impossible.,I think I can make a guess now --,education is self-organizing system,,where learning is an emergent phenomenon.,It'll take a few years to prove it, experimentally,,but I'm going to try.,But in the meanwhile, there is a method available.,One billion children, we need 100 million mediators --,there are many more than that on the planet --,10 million SOLEs,,180 billion dollars and 10 years.,We could change everything. 
 Thanks. 
 (Applause)I want to talk to you today about prosperity,,about our hopes,for a shared and lasting prosperity.,And not just us,,but the two billion people worldwide,who are still chronically undernourished.,And hope actually is at the heart of this.,In fact, the Latin word for hope,is at the heart of the word prosperity.,"Pro-speras," "speras," hope --,in accordance with our hopes and expectations.,The irony is, though,,that we have cashed-out prosperity,almost literally in terms of money and economic growth.,And we've grown our economies so much,that we now stand,in a real danger,of undermining hope --,running down resources, cutting down rainforests,,spilling oil into the Gulf of Mexico,,changing the climate --,and the only thing that has actually,remotely slowed down the relentless rise,of carbon emissions over the last two to three decades,is recession.,And recession, of course,,isn't exactly a recipe for hope either,,as we're busy finding out.,So we're caught in a kind of trap.,It's a dilemma, a dilemma of growth.,We can't live with it; we can't live without it.,Trash the system or crash the planet --,it's a tough choice; it isn't much of a choice.,And our best avenue of escape from this actually,is a kind of blind faith,in our own cleverness and technology and efficiency,and doing things more efficiently.,Now I haven't got anything against efficiency.,And I think we are a clever species sometimes.,But I think we should also just check the numbers,,take a reality check here. 
 So I want you to imagine a world,,in 2050, of around nine billion people,,all aspiring to Western incomes,,Western lifestyles.,And I want to ask the question --,and we'll give them that two percent hike in income, in salary each year as well,,because we believe in growth.,And I want to ask the question:,how far and how fast would be have to move?,How clever would we have to be?,How much technology would we need in this world,to deliver our carbon targets?,And here in my chart --,on the left-hand side is where we are now.,This is the carbon intensity of economic growth,in the economy at the moment.,It's around about 770 grams of carbon.,In the world I describe to you,,we have to be right over here at the right-hand side,at six grams of carbon.,It's a 130-fold improvement,,and that is 10 times further and faster,than anything we've ever achieved in industrial history.,Maybe we can do it, maybe it's possible -- who knows?,Maybe we can even go further,and get an economy that pulls carbon out of the atmosphere,,which is what we're going to need to be doing,by the end of the century.,But shouldn't we just check first,that the economic system that we have,is remotely capable of delivering,this kind of improvement? 
 So I want to just spend a couple of minutes on system dynamics.,It's a bit complex, and I apologize for that.,What I'll try and do, is I'll try and paraphrase it,is sort of human terms.,So it looks a little bit like this.,Firms produce goods for households -- that's us --,and provide us with incomes,,and that's even better, because we can spend those incomes,on more goods and services.,That's called the circular flow of the economy.,It looks harmless enough.,I just want to highlight one key feature of this system,,which is the role of investment.,Now investment constitutes,only about a fifth of the national income,in most modern economies,,but it plays an absolutely vital role.,And what it does essentially,is to stimulate further consumption growth.,It does this in a couple of ways --,chasing productivity,,which drives down prices and encourages us to buy more stuff.,But I want to concentrate,on the role of investment,in seeking out novelty,,the production and consumption of novelty.,Joseph Schumpeter called this,"the process of creative destruction.",It's a process of the production and reproduction of novelty,,continually chasing expanding consumer markets,,consumer goods, new consumer goods. 
 And this, this is where it gets interesting,,because it turns out that human beings,have something of an appetite for novelty.,We love new stuff --,new material stuff for sure --,but also new ideas, new adventures,,new experiences.,But the materiality matters too,,because in every society,that anthropologists have looked at,,material stuff,operates as a kind of language --,a language of goods,,a symbolic language,that we use to tell each other stories --,stories, for example,,about how important we are.,Status-driven, conspicuous consumption,thrives from the language,of novelty.,And here, all of a sudden,,we have a system,that is locking economic structure with social logic --,the economic institutions, and who we are as people, locked together,to drive an engine of growth.,And this engine is not just economic value;,it is pulling material resources,relentlessly through the system,,driven by our own insatiable appetites,,driven in fact by a sense of anxiety.,Adam Smith, 200 years ago,,spoke about our desire,for a life without shame.,A life without shame:,in his day, what that meant was a linen shirt,,and today, well, you still need the shirt,,but you need the hybrid car,,the HDTV, two holidays a year in the sun,,the netbook and iPad, the list goes on --,an almost inexhaustible supply of goods,,driven by this anxiety.,And even if we don't want them,,we need to buy them,,because, if we don't buy them, the system crashes.,And to stop it crashing,over the last two to three decades,,we've expanded the money supply,,expanded credit and debt,,so that people can keep buying stuff.,And of course, that expansion was deeply implicated in the crisis. 
 But this -- I just want to show you some data here.,This is what it looks like, essentially,,this credit and debt system, just for the U.K.,This was the last 15 years before the crash,,and you can see there, consumer debt rose dramatically.,It was above the GDP for three years in a row,just before the crisis.,And in the mean time, personal savings absolutely plummeted.,The savings ratio, net savings,,were below zero in the middle of 2008,,just before the crash.,This is people expanding debt, drawing down their savings,,just to stay in the game.,This is a strange, rather perverse, story,,just to put it in very simple terms.,It's a story about us, people,,being persuaded,to spend money we don't have,on things we don't need,to create impressions that won't last,on people we don't care about. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 But before we consign ourselves to despair,,maybe we should just go back and say, "Did we get this right?,Is this really how people are?,Is this really how economies behave?",And almost straightaway,we actually run up against a couple of anomalies.,The first one is in the crisis itself.,In the crisis, in the recession, what do people want to do?,They want to hunker down, they want to look to the future.,They want to spend less and save more.,But saving is exactly the wrong thing to do,from the system point of view.,Keynes called this the "paradox of thrift" --,saving slows down recovery.,And politicians call on us continually,to draw down more debt,,to draw down our own savings even further,,just so that we can get the show back on the road,,so we can keep this growth-based economy going.,It's an anomaly,,it's a place where the system actually is at odds,with who we are as people. 
 Here's another one -- completely different one:,Why is it,that we don't do the blindingly obvious things we should do,to combat climate change,,very, very simple things,like buying energy-efficient appliances,,putting in efficient lights, turning the lights off occasionally,,insulating our homes?,These things save carbon, they save energy,,they save us money.,So is it that, though they make perfect economic sense,,we don't do them?,Well, I had my own personal insight into this,a few years ago.,It was a Sunday evening, Sunday afternoon,,and it was just after --,actually, to be honest, too long after --,we had moved into a new house.,And I had finally got around to doing some draft stripping,,installing insulation around the windows and doors,to keep out the drafts.,And my, then, five year-old daughter,was helping me in the way that five year-olds do.,And we'd been doing this for a while,,when she turned to me very solemnly and said,,"Will this really keep out the giraffes?",(Laughter),"Here they are, the giraffes.",You can hear the five-year-old mind working.,These ones, interestingly, are 400 miles north of here,outside Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria.,Goodness knows what they make of the Lake District weather.,But actually that childish misrepresentation,stuck with me,,because it suddenly became clear to me,why we don't do the blindingly obvious things.,We're too busy keeping out the giraffes --,putting the kids on the bus in the morning,,getting ourselves to work on time,,surviving email overload,and shop floor politics,,foraging for groceries, throwing together meals,,escaping for a couple of precious hours in the evening,into prime-time TV,or TED online,,getting from one end of the day to the other,,keeping out the giraffes. 
 (Laughter) 
 What is the objective?,"What is the objective of the consumer?",Mary Douglas asked in an essay on poverty,written 35 years ago.,"It is," she said,,"to help create the social world,and find a credible place in it.",That is a deeply humanizing,vision of our lives,,and it's a completely different vision,than the one that lies at the heart,of this economic model.,So who are we?,Who are these people?,Are we these novelty-seeking, hedonistic,,selfish individuals?,Or might we actually occasionally be,something like the selfless altruist,depicted in Rembrandt's lovely, lovely sketch here?,Well psychology actually says,there is a tension --,a tension between self-regarding behaviors,and other regarding behaviors.,And these tensions have deep evolutionary roots,,so selfish behavior,is adaptive in certain circumstances --,fight or flight. 
 But other regarding behaviors,are essential to our evolution,as social beings.,And perhaps even more interesting from our point of view,,another tension between novelty-seeking behaviors,and tradition or conservation.,Novelty is adaptive when things are changing,and you need to adapt yourself.,Tradition is essential to lay down the stability,to raise families and form cohesive social groups.,So here, all of a sudden,,we're looking at a map of the human heart.,And it reveals to us, suddenly,,the crux of the matter.,What we've done is we've created economies.,We've created systems,,which systematically privilege, encourage,,one narrow quadrant,of the human soul,and left the others unregarded.,And in the same token, the solution becomes clear,,because this isn't, therefore,,about changing human nature.,It isn't, in fact, about curtailing possibilities.,It is about opening up.,It is about allowing ourselves the freedom,to become fully human,,recognizing the depth and the breadth,of the human psyche,and building institutions,to protect Rembrandt's fragile altruist within. 
 What does all this mean for economics?,What would economies look like,if we took that vision of human nature,at their heart,and stretched them,along these orthogonal dimensions,of the human psyche?,Well, it might look a little bit,like the 4,000 community-interest companies,that have sprung up in the U.K. over the last five years,and a similar rise in B corporations in the United States,,enterprises,that have ecological and social goals,written into their constitution,at their heart --,companies, in fact, like this one, Ecosia.,And I just want to, very quickly, show you this.,Ecosia is an Internet search engine.,Internet search engines work,by drawing revenues from sponsored links,that appear when you do a search.,And Ecosia works in pretty much the same way.,So we can do that here --,we can just put in a little search term.,There you go, Oxford, that's where we are. See what comes up.,The difference with Ecosia though,is that, in Ecosia's case,,it draws the revenues in the same way,,but it allocates,80 percent of those revenues,to a rainforest protection project in the Amazon.,And we're going to do it.,We're just going to click on Naturejobs.uk.,In case anyone out there is looking for a job in a recession,,that's the page to go to.,And what happened then was,the sponsor gave revenues to Ecosia,,and Ecosia is giving 80 percent of those revenues,to a rainforest protection project.,It's taking profits from one place,and allocating them,into the protection of ecological resources. 
 It's a different kind of enterprise,for a new economy.,It's a form, if you like,,of ecological altruism --,perhaps something along those lines. Maybe it's that.,Whatever it is,,whatever this new economy is,,what we need the economy to do, in fact,,is to put investment,back into the heart of the model,,to re-conceive investment.,Only now, investment,isn't going to be,about the relentless and mindless,pursuit of consumption growth.,Investment has to be a different beast.,Investment has to be,,in the new economy,,protecting and nurturing,the ecological assets on which our future depends.,It has to be about transition.,It has to be investing in low-carbon technologies,and infrastructures.,We have to invest, in fact,,in the idea of a meaningful prosperity,,providing capabilities,for people to flourish. 
 And of course, this task has material dimensions.,It would be nonsense to talk about people flourishing,if they didn't have food, clothing and shelter.,But it's also clear that prosperity goes beyond this.,It has social and psychological aims --,family, friendship,,commitments, society,,participating in the life of that society.,And this too,requires investment,,investment -- for example, in places --,places where we can connect,,places where we can participate,,shared spaces,,concert halls, gardens,,public parks,,libraries, museums, quiet centers,,places of joy and celebration,,places of tranquility and contemplation,,sites for the "cultivation,of a common citizenship,",in Michael Sandel's lovely phrase.,An investment -- investment, after all, is just such a basic economic concept --,is nothing more nor less,than a relationship,between the present and the future,,a shared present and a common future.,And we need that relationship to reflect,,to reclaim hope. 
 So let me come back, with this sense of hope,,to the two billion people,still trying to live each day,on less than the price of a skinny latte,from the cafe next door.,What can we offer those people?,It's clear that we have a responsibility,to help lift them out of poverty.,It's clear that we have a responsibility,to make room for growth,where growth really matters in those poorest nations.,And it's also clear that we will never achieve that,unless we're capable of redefining,a meaningful sense of prosperity in the richer nations,,a prosperity that is more meaningful,and less materialistic,than the growth-based model.,So this is not just,a Western post-materialist fantasy.,In fact, an African philosopher wrote to me,,when "Prosperity Without Growth" was published,,pointing out the similarities,between this view of prosperity,and the traditional African concept of ubuntu.,Ubuntu says, "I am,because we are.",Prosperity is a shared endeavor.,Its roots are long and deep --,its foundations, I've tried to show,,exist already, inside each of us.,So this is not about,standing in the way of development.,It's not about,overthrowing capitalism.,It's not about,trying to change human nature.,What we're doing here,is we're taking a few simple steps,towards an economics fit for purpose.,And at the heart of that economics,,we're placing a more credible,,more robust,,and more realistic vision,of what it means to be human. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: While they're taking the podium away, just a quick question.,First of all, economists aren't supposed to be inspiring,,so you may need to work on the tone a little.,(Laughter),Can you picture the politicians ever buying into this?,I mean, can you picture,a politician standing up in Britain and saying,,"GDP fell two percent this year. Good news!,We're actually all happier, and a country's more beautiful,,and our lives are better." 
 Tim Jackson: Well that's clearly not what you're doing.,You're not making news out of things falling down.,You're making news out of the things that tell you that we're flourishing.,Can I picture politicians doing it?,Actually, I already am seeing a little bit of it.,When we first started this kind of work,,politicians would stand up, treasury spokesmen would stand up,,and accuse us of wanting to go back and live in caves.,And actually in the period,through which we've been working over the last 18 years --,partly because of the financial crisis,and a little bit of humility in the profession of economics --,actually people are engaging in this issue,in all sorts of countries around the world. 
 CA: But is it mainly politicians who are going to have to get their act together,,or is it going to be more just civil society and companies? 
 TJ: It has to be companies. It has to be civil society.,But it has to have political leadership.,This is a kind of agenda,,which actually politicians themselves,are kind of caught in that dilemma,,because they're hooked on the growth model themselves.,But actually opening up the space,to think about different ways of governing,,different kinds of politics,,and creating the space,for civil society and businesses to operate differently --,absolutely vital. 
 CA: And if someone could convince you,that we actually can make the -- what was it? --,the 130-fold improvement in efficiency,,of reduction of carbon footprint,,would you then actually like that picture of economic growth,into more knowledge-based goods? 
 TJ: I would still want to know that you could do that,and get below zero by the end of the century,,in terms of taking carbon out of the atmosphere,,and solve the problem of biodiversity,and reduce the impact on land use,and do something about the erosion of topsoils and the quality of water.,If you can convince me we can do all that,,then, yes, I would take the two percent. 
 CA: Tim, thank you for a very important talk. Thank you. 
 (Applause)This cell phone,started its trajectory,in an artisanal mine,in the Eastern Congo.,It's mined by armed gangs,using slaves, child slaves,,what the U.N. Security Council,calls "blood minerals,",then traveled into some components,and ended up in a factory,in Shinjin in China.,That factory -- over a dozen people have committed suicide,already this year.,One man died after working a 36-hour shift.,We all love chocolate.,We buy it for our kids.,Eighty percent of the cocoa comes from Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana,and it's harvested by children.,Cote d'Ivoire, we have a huge problem of child slaves.,Children have been trafficked from other conflict zones,to come and work on the coffee plantations.,Heparin -- a blood thinner,,a pharmaceutical product --,starts out in artisanal workshops,like this in China,,because the active ingredient,comes from pigs' intestines.,Your diamond -- you've all heard, probably seen the movie "Blood Diamond.",This is a mine in Zimbabwe,right now.,Cotton: Uzbekistan is the second biggest,exporter of cotton on Earth.,Every year when it comes to the cotton harvest,,the government shuts down the schools,,puts the kids in buses, buses them to the cotton fields,to spend three weeks harvesting the cotton.,It's forced child labor,on an institutional scale.,And all of those products probably end their lives,in a dump like this one in Manila. 
 These places, these origins,,represent governance gaps.,That's the politest description,I have for them.,These are the dark pools,where global supply chains begin --,the global supply chains,,which bring us our favorite brand name products.,Some of these governance gaps,are run by rogue states.,Some of them are not states anymore at all.,They're failed states.,Some of them,are just countries who believe that deregulation or no regulation,is the best way to attract investment,,promote trade.,Either way, they present us,with a huge moral and ethical dilemma.,I know that none of us want to be accessories,after the fact,of a human rights abuse,in a global supply chain.,But right now,,most of the companies involved in these supply chains,don't have any way,of assuring us,that nobody had to mortgage their future,,nobody had to sacrifice their rights,to bring us our favorite,brand name product. 
 Now, I didn't come here to depress you,about the state of the global supply chain.,We need a reality check.,We need to recognize just how serious,a deficit of rights we have.,This is an independent republic,,probably a failed state.,It's definitely not a democratic state.,And right now,,that independent republic of the supply chain,is not being governed,in a way that would satisfy us,,that we can engage in ethical trade or ethical consumption.,Now, that's not a new story.,You've seen the documentaries,of sweatshops making garments,all over the world, even in developed countries.,You want to see the classic sweatshop,,meet me at Madison Square Garden,,I'll take you down the street, and I'll show you a Chinese sweatshop. 
 But take the example of heparin.,It's a pharmaceutical product.,You expect that the supply chain that gets it to the hospital,,probably squeaky clean.,The problem is that the active ingredient in there --,as I mentioned earlier --,comes from pigs.,The main American manufacturer,of that active ingredient,decided a few years ago to relocate to China,because it's the world's biggest supplier of pigs.,And their factory in China --,which probably is pretty clean --,is getting all of the ingredients,from backyard abattoirs,,where families slaughter pigs,and extract the ingredient.,So a couple of years ago, we had a scandal,which killed about 80 people around the world,,because of contaminants,that crept into the heparin supply chain.,Worse, some of the suppliers,realized that they could substitute a product,which mimicked heparin in tests.,This substitute cost nine dollars a pound,,whereas real heparin, the real ingredient,,cost 900 dollars a pound.,A no-brainer.,The problem was that it killed more people. 
 And so you're asking yourself,,"How come the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,allowed this to happen?,How did the Chinese State Agency for Food and Drugs,allow this to happen?",And the answer is quite simple:,the Chinese define these facilities,as chemical facilities, not pharmaceutical facilities,,so they don't audit them.,And the USFDA,has a jurisdictional problem.,This is offshore.,They actually do conduct a few investigations overseas --,about a dozen a year -- maybe 20 in a good year.,There are 500,of these facilities,producing active ingredients in China alone.,In fact, about 80 percent,of the active ingredients in medicines now,come from offshore,,particularly China and India,,and we don't have a governance system.,We don't have a regulatory system,able to ensure,that that production is safe.,We don't have a system to ensure,that human rights, basic dignity,,are ensured. 
 So at a national level --,and we work in about 60 different countries --,at a national level,we've got a serious breakdown in the ability of governments,to regulate production,on their own soil.,And the real problem with the global supply chain,is that it's supranational.,So governments who are failing,,who are dropping the ball,at a national level,,have even less ability to get their arms around the problem,at an international level.,And you can just look at the headlines.,Take Copenhagen last year --,complete failure of governments,to do the right thing,in the face of an international challenge.,Take the G20 meeting a couple of weeks ago --,stepped back from its commitments of just a few months ago.,You can take any one,of the major global challenges we've discussed this week,and ask yourself, where is the leadership from governments,to step up and come up with solutions,,responses,,to those international problems?,And the simple answer is they can't. They're national.,Their voters are local.,They have parochial interests.,They can't subordinate those interests,to the greater global public good. 
 So, if we're going to ensure the delivery,of the key public goods,at an international level --,in this case, in the global supply chain --,we have to come up with a different mechanism.,We need a different machine.,Fortunately, we have some examples.,In the 1990s,,there were a whole series of scandals,concerning the production of brand name goods in the U.S. --,child labor, forced labor,,serious health and safety abuses.,And eventually President Clinton, in 1996,,convened a meeting at the White House,,invited industry, human rights NGOs,,trade unions, the Department of Labor,,got them all in a room,and said, "Look,,I don't want globalization to be a race to the bottom.,I don't know how to prevent that,,but I'm at least going to use my good offices,to get you folks together,to come up with a response.",So they formed a White House task force,,and they spent about three years arguing,about who takes how much responsibility,in the global supply chain.,Companies didn't feel it was their responsibility.,They don't own those facilities.,They don't employ those workers.,They're not legally liable.,Everybody else at the table,said, "Folks, that doesn't cut it.,You have a custodial duty, a duty of care,,to make sure that that product,gets from wherever to the store,in a way that allows us to consume it,,without fear of our safety,,or without having to sacrifice our conscience,to consume that product.",So they agreed, "Okay, what we'll do,is we agree on a common set of standards,,code of conduct.,We'll apply that throughout,our global supply chain,regardless of ownership or control.,We'll make it part of the contract.",And that was a stroke of absolute genius,,because what they did,was they harnessed the power of the contract,,private power,,to deliver public goods. 
 And let's face it,,the contract from a major multinational brand,to a supplier in India or China,has much more persuasive value,than the local labor law,,the local environmental regulations,,the local human rights standards.,Those factories will probably never see an inspector.,If the inspector did come along,,it would be amazing if they were able,to resist the bribe.,Even if they did their jobs,,and they cited those facilities for their violations,,the fine would be derisory.,But you lose that contract,for a major brand name,,that's the difference,between staying in business or going bankrupt.,That makes a difference.,So what we've been able to do,is we've been able to harness,the power and the influence,of the only truly transnational institution,in the global supply chain,,that of the multinational company,,and get them to do the right thing,,get them to use that power for good,,to deliver the key public goods. 
 Now of course, this doesn't come naturally,to multinational companies.,They weren't set up to do this. They're set up to make money.,But they are extremely efficient organizations.,They have resources,,and if we can add the will, the commitment,,they know how to deliver that product.,Now, getting there is not easy.,Those supply chains I put up on the screen earlier,,they're not there.,You need a safe space.,You need a place where people can come together,,sit down without fear of judgment,,without recrimination,,to actually face the problem,,agree on the problem and come up with solutions.,We can do it. The technical solutions are there.,The problem is the lack of trust, the lack of confidence,,the lack of partnership,between NGOs, campaign groups,,civil society organizations,and multinational companies.,If we can put those two together in a safe space,,get them to work together,,we can deliver public goods right now,,or in extremely short supply. 
 This is a radical proposition,,and it's crazy to think,that if you're a 15-year-old Bangladeshi girl,leaving your rural village,to go and work in a factory in Dhaka --,22, 23, 24 dollars a month --,your best chance of enjoying rights at work,is if that factory is producing,for a brand name company,which has got a code of conduct,and made that code of conduct part of the contract.,It's crazy.,Multinationals are protecting human rights.,I know there's going to be disbelief.,You'll say, "How can we trust them?",Well, we don't.,It's the old arms control phrase:,"Trust, but verify.",So we audit.,We take their supply chain, we take all the factory names,,we do a random sample,,we send inspectors on an unannounced basis,to inspect those facilities,,and then we publish the results.,Transparency is absolutely critical to this.,You can call yourself responsible,,but responsibility without accountability,often doesn't work.,So what we're doing is, we're not only enlisting the multinationals,,we're giving them the tools to deliver this public good --,respect for human rights --,and we're checking.,You don't need to believe me. You shouldn't believe me.,Go to the website. Look at the audit results.,Ask yourself, is this company behaving,in a socially responsible way?,Can I buy that product,without compromising my ethics?,That's the way the system works. 
 I hate the idea,that governments are not protecting human rights around the world.,I hate the idea,that governments have dropped this ball,and I can't get used to the idea,that somehow we can't get them to do their jobs.,I've been at this for 30 years,,and in that time I've seen,the ability, the commitment, the will of government,to do this decline,,and I don't see them making a comeback right now.,So we started out thinking,this was a stopgap measure.,We're now thinking that, in fact,,this is probably the start,of a new way of regulating and addressing,international challenges.,Call it network governance. Call it what you will.,The private actors,,companies and NGOs,,are going to have to get together,to face the major challenges we are going to face.,Just look at pandemics --,swine flu, bird flu, H1N1.,Look at the health systems in so many countries.,Do they have the resources,to face up to a serious pandemic?,No.,Could the private sector and NGOs,get together and marshal a response?,Absolutely.,What they lack is that safe space,to come together, agree,and move to action.,That's what we're trying to provide. 
 I know as well,that this often seems,like an overwhelming level of responsibility,for people to assume.,"You want me to deliver human rights,throughout my global supply chain.,There are thousands of suppliers in there.",It seems too daunting, too dangerous,,for any company to take on.,But there are companies.,We have 4,000 companies who are members.,Some of them are very, very large companies.,The sporting goods industry, in particular,,stepped up to the plate and have done it.,The example, the role model, is there.,And whenever we discuss,one of these problems that we have to address --,child labor in cottonseed farms in India --,this year we will monitor 50,000 cottonseed farms in India.,It seems overwhelming.,The numbers just make you want to zone out.,But we break it down to some basic realities. 
 And human rights,comes down to a very simple proposition:,can I give this person their dignity back?,Poor people,,people whose human rights have been violated --,the crux of that,is the loss of dignity,,the lack of dignity.,It starts with just giving people back their dignity.,I was sitting in a slum outside Gurgaon,just next to Delhi,,one of the flashiest, brightest new cities,popping up in India right now,,and I was talking to workers,who worked in garment sweatshops down the road,,and I asked them what message they would like me to take to the brands.,They didn't say money.,They said, "The people who employ us,treat us like we are less than human,,like we don't exist.,Please ask them to treat us like human beings.",That's my simple understanding of human rights.,That's my simple proposition to you,,my simple plea to every decision-maker,in this room, everybody out there.,We can all make a decision,to come together,and pick up the balls and run with the balls,that governments have dropped.,If we don't do it,,we're abandoning hope,,we're abandoning our essential humanity,,and I know that's not a place we want to be,,and we don't have to be there.,So I appeal to you.,Join us, come into that safe space,,and let's start to make this happen. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)So this is a story,of a place that I now call home.,It's a story of public education,and of rural communities,and of what design might do to improve both.,So this is Bertie County,,North Carolina, USA.,To give you an idea of the "where:",So here's North Carolina, and if we zoom in,,Bertie County is in the eastern part of the state.,It's about two hours east,driving-time from Raleigh.,And it's very flat. It's very swampy.,It's mostly farmland.,The entire county,is home to just 20,000 people, and they're very sparsely distributed.,So there's only 27 people per square mile,,which comes down to about 10 people,per square kilometer. 
 Bertie County is kind of a prime example,in the demise of rural America.,We've seen this story all over the country,and even in places beyond the American borders.,We know the symptoms.,It's the hollowing out of small towns.,It's downtowns becoming ghost towns.,The brain drain --,where all of the most educated and qualified leave and never come back.,It's the dependence on farm subsidies,and under-performing schools,and higher poverty rates in rural areas,than in urban.,And Bertie County is no exception to this.,Perhaps the biggest thing it struggles with,,like many communities similar to it,,is that there's no,shared, collective investment,in the future of rural communities.,Only 6.8 percent of all our philanthropic giving in the U.S. right now,benefits rural communities,,and yet 20 percent of our population lives there. 
 So Bertie County is not only very rural; it's incredibly poor.,It is the poorest county in the state.,It has one in three of its children living in poverty,,and it's what is referred to as a "rural ghetto.",The economy is mostly agricultural.,The biggest crops are cotton and tobacco,,and we're very proud of our Bertie County peanut.,The biggest employer is the Purdue chicken processing plant.,The county seat is Windsor.,This is like Times Square of Windsor that you're looking at right now.,It's home to only 2,000 people,,and like a lot of other small towns,it has been hollowed out over the years.,There are more buildings that are empty or in disrepair,than occupied and in use.,You can count the number of restaurants in the county,on one hand --,Bunn's Barbecue being my absolute favorite.,But in the whole county there is no coffee shop,,there's no Internet cafe,,there's no movie theater, there's no bookstore.,There isn't even a Walmart. 
 Racially, the county,is about 60 percent African-American,,but what happens in the public schools,is most of the privileged white kids,go to the private Lawrence Academy.,So the public school students,are about 86 percent African-American.,And this is a spread from the local newspaper of the recent graduating class,,and you can see the difference is pretty stark.,So to say that the public education system,in Bertie County is struggling,would be a huge understatement.,There's basically no pool,of qualified teachers to pull from,,and only eight percent of the people in the county,have a bachelor's degree or higher.,So there isn't a big legacy,in the pride of education.,In fact, two years ago,,only 27 percent of all the third- through eighth-graders,were passing the state standard,in both English and math. 
 So it sounds like I'm painting a really bleak picture of this place,,but I promise there is good news.,The biggest asset, in my opinion,,one of the biggest assets in Bertie County right now is this man:,This is Dr. Chip Zullinger,,fondly known as Dr. Z.,He was brought in in October 2007,as the new superintendent,to basically fix this broken school system.,And he previously was a superintendent,in Charleston, South Carolina,and then in Denver, Colorado.,He started some of the country's first charter schools,in the late '80s in the U.S.,And he is an absolute renegade and a visionary,,and he is the reason that I now live and work there.,So in February of 2009,,Dr. Zullinger invited us, Project H Design --,which is a non-profit design firm that I founded --,to come to Bertie and to partner with him,on the repair of this school district,and to bring a design perspective to the repair of the school district.,And he invited us in particular,because we have a very specific,type of design process --,one that results in appropriate design solutions,in places that don't usually have access,to design services or creative capital.,Specifically, we use these six design directives,,probably the most important being number two:,we design with, not for --,in that, when we're doing humanitarian-focused design,,it's not about designing for clients anymore.,It's about designing with people,,and letting appropriate solutions emerge from within. 
 So at the time of being invited down there,,we were based in San Francisco,,and so we were going back and forth,for basically the rest of 2009,,spending about half our time in Bertie County.,And when I say we, I mean Project H,,but more specifically, I mean myself and my partner, Matthew Miller,,who's an architect and a sort of MacGyver-type builder.,So fast-forward to today, and we now live there.,I have strategically cut Matt's head out of this photo,,because he would kill me if he knew I was using it,because of the sweatsuits.,But this is our front porch. We live there.,We now call this place home.,Over the course of this year that we spent flying back and forth,,we realized we had fallen in love with the place.,We had fallen in love with the place and the people,and the work that we're able to do,in a rural place like Bertie County,,that, as designers and builders,,you can't do everywhere.,There's space to experiment,and to weld and to test things.,We have an amazing advocate in Dr. Zullinger.,There's a nobility of real, hands-on,,dirt-under-your-fingernails work. 
 But beyond our personal reasons for wanting to be there,,there is a huge need.,There is a total vacuum of creative capital in Bertie County.,There isn't a single licensed architect in the whole county.,And so we saw an opportunity,to bring design as this untouched tool,,something that Bertie County didn't otherwise have,,and to be sort of the -- to usher that in,as a new type of tool in their tool kit.,The initial goal became using design,within the public education system in partnership with Dr. Zullinger --,that was why we were there.,But beyond that, we recognized,that Bertie County, as a community,,was in dire need of a fresh perspective,of pride and connectedness,and of the creative capital,that they were so much lacking.,So the goal became, yes, to apply design within education,,but then to figure out how to make education,a great vehicle for community development. 
 So in order to do this, we've taken three different approaches,to the intersection of design and education.,And I should say that these are three things that we've done in Bertie County,,but I feel pretty confident that they could work,in a lot of other rural communities,around the U.S. and maybe even beyond.,So the first of the three is design for education.,This is the most kind of direct, obvious,intersection of the two things.,It's the physical construction,of improved spaces and materials and experiences,for teachers and students.,This is in response to the awful mobile trailers,and the outdated textbooks,and the terrible materials that we're building schools out of these days.,And so this played out for us in a couple different ways.,The first was a series of renovations of computer labs.,So traditionally, the computer labs,,particularly in an under-performing school like Bertie County,,where they have to benchmark test every other week,,the computer lab is a kill-and-drill,testing facility.,You come in, you face the wall, you take your test and you leave.,So we wanted to change the way that students approach technology,,to create a more convivial and social space,that was more engaging, more accessible,,and also to increase the ability for teachers,to use these spaces for technology-based instruction.,So this is the lab at the high school,,and the principal there is in love with this room.,Every time he has visitors, it's the first place that he takes them. 
 And this also meant the co-creation with some teachers,of this educational playground system,called the learning landscape.,It allows elementary-level students to learn core subjects,through game play and activity,and running around and screaming and being a kid.,So this game that the kids are playing here --,in this case they were learning basic multiplication,through a game called Match Me.,And in Match Me, you take the class, divide it into two teams,,one team on each side of the playground,,and the teacher will take a piece of chalk,and just write a number on each of the tires.,And then she'll call out a math problem --,so let's say four times four --,and then one student from each team has to compete,to figure out that four times four is 16,and find the tire with the 16 on it and sit on it.,So the goal is to have all of your teammates sitting on the tires,and then your team wins.,And the impact of the learning landscape,has been pretty surprising and amazing.,Some of the classes and teachers have reported higher test scores,,a greater comfort level with the material,,especially with the boys,,that in going outside and playing,,they aren't afraid to take on,a double-digit multiplication problem --,and also that the teachers are able,to use these as assessment tools,to better gauge how their students,are understanding new material.,So with design for education, I think the most important thing,is to have a shared ownership of the solutions with the teachers,,so that they have the incentive and the desire to use them.,So this is Mr. Perry. He's the assistant superintendent.,He came out for one of our teacher-training days,and won like five rounds of Match Me in a row and was very proud of himself. 
 (Laughter) 
 So the second approach is redesigning education itself.,This is the most complex.,It's a systems-level look,at how education is administered,and what is being offered and to whom.,So in many cases this is not so much about making change,as it is creating the conditions,under which change is possible,and the incentive to want to make change,,which is easier said than done in rural communities,and in inside-the-box education systems,in rural communities.,So for us, this was a graphic public campaign,called Connect Bertie.,There are thousands of these blue dots all over the county.,And this was for a fund that the school district had,to put a desktop computer and a broadband Internet connection,in every home,with a child in the public school system.,Right now I should say,,there are only 10 percent of the houses,that actually have an in-home Internet connection.,And the only places to get WiFi,are in the school buildings, or at the Bojangles Fried Chicken joint,,which I find myself squatting outside of a lot.,Aside from, you know, getting people excited,and wondering what the heck these blue dots were all over the place,,it asked the school system,to envision how it might become a catalyst,for a more connected community.,It asked them to reach outside of the school walls,and to think about how they could play a role,in the community's development.,So the first batch of computers,are being installed later this summer,,and we're helping Dr. Zullinger develop some strategies,around how we might connect the classroom and the home,to extend learning beyond the school day. 
 And then the third approach, which is what I'm most excited about,,which is where we are now,,is: design as education.,So "design as education" means,that we could actually teach design within public schools,,and not design-based learning --,not like "let's learn physics by building a rocket,",but actually learning design-thinking,coupled with real construction and fabrication skills,put towards a local community purpose.,It also means that designers are no longer consultants,,but we're teachers,,and we are charged with growing creative capital,within the next generation.,And what design offers as an educational framework,is an antidote,to all of the boring, rigid, verbal instruction,that so many of these school districts are plagued by.,It's hands-on, it's in-your-face,,it requires an active engagement,,and it allows kids to apply all the core subject learning,in real ways.,So we started thinking,about the legacy of shop class,and how shop class -- wood and metal shop class in particular --,historically, has been something,intended for kids who aren't going to go to college.,It's a vocational training path.,It's working-class; it's blue-collar.,The projects are things like,,let's make a birdhouse for your mom for Christmas.,And in recent decades, a lot of the funding for shop class,has gone away entirely. 
 So we thought, what if you could bring back shop class,,but this time orient the projects,around things that the community needed,,and to infuse shop class,with a more critical and creative-design-thinking studio process.,So we took this kind of nebulous idea,and have worked really closely with Dr. Zullinger for the past year,on writing this as a one-year curriculum,offered at the high school level to the junior class.,And so this starts in four weeks,,at the end of the summer,,and my partner and I, Matthew and I,,just went through the arduous and totally convoluted process,of getting certified as high school teachers to actually run it.,And this is what it looks like. 
 So over the course of two semesters,,the Fall and the Spring,,the students spend three hours a day every single day,in our 4,500 square foot,studio/shop space.,And during that time, they're doing everything,from going out and doing ethnographic research and doing the need-finding,,coming back into the studio,,doing the brainstorming and design visualization,to come up with concepts that might work,,and then moving into the shop and actually testing them,,building them, prototyping them,,figuring out if they are going to work and refining that.,And then over the summer, they're offered a summer job.,They're paid as employees of Project H,to be the construction crew with us,to build these projects in the community.,So the first project, which will be built next summer,,is an open-air farmers' market downtown,,followed by bus shelters for the school bus system in the second year,and home improvements for the elderly in the third year.,So these are real visible projects,that hopefully the students can point to and say,,"I built that, and I'm proud of it." 
 So I want you to meet three of our students.,This is Ryan.,She is 15 years old.,She loves agriculture and wants to be a high school teacher.,She wants to go to college, but she wants to come back to Bertie County,,because that's where her family is from, where she calls home,,and she feels very strongly about giving back,to this place that she's been fairly fortunate in.,So what Studio H might offer her,is a way to develop skills,so that she might give back in the most meaningful way. 
 This is Eric. He plays for the football team.,He is really into dirtbike racing,,and he wants to be an architect.,So for him, Studio H offers him,a way to develop the skills he will need as an architect,,everything from drafting to wood and metal construction,to how to do research for a client. 
 And then this is Anthony.,He is 16 years old, loves hunting and fishing and being outside,and doing anything with his hands,,and so for him, Studio H means,that he can stay interested in his education,through that hands-on engagement.,He's interested in forestry, but he isn't sure,,so if he ends up not going to college,,he will have developed some industry-relevant skills. 
 What design and building really offers to public education,is a different kind of classroom.,So this building downtown,,which may very well become the site of our future farmers' market,,is now the classroom.,And going out into the community and interviewing your neighbors,about what kind of food they buy,and from where and why --,that's a homework assignment.,And the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the end of the summer,when they have built the farmers' market and it's open to the public --,that's the final exam.,And for the community, what design and building offers,is real, visible, built progress.,It's one project per year,,and it makes the youth the biggest asset,and the biggest untapped resource,in imagining a new future. 
 So we recognize that Studio H, especially in its first year,,is a small story --,13 students, it's two teachers,,it's one project in one place.,But we feel like this could work in other places.,And I really, strongly believe in the power of the small story,,because it is so difficult,to do humanitarian work at a global scale.,Because, when you zoom out that far,,you lose the ability to view people as humans. 
 Ultimately, design itself is a process,of constant education,for the people that we work with and for,and for us as designers.,And let's face it, designers, we need to reinvent ourselves.,We need to re-educate ourselves around the things that matter,,we need to work outside of our comfort zones more,,and we need to be better citizens in our own backyard.,So while this is a very small story,,we hope that it represents a step in the right direction,for the future of rural communities,and for the future of public education,and hopefully also for the future of design. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I have a doppelganger.,(Laughter),Dr. Gero is a brilliant,but slightly mad scientist,in the "Dragonball Z: Android Saga.",If you look very carefully,,you see that his skull has been replaced,with a transparent Plexiglas dome,so that the workings of his brain can be observed,and also controlled with light.,That's exactly what I do --,optical mind control. 
 (Laughter) 
 But in contrast to my evil twin,who lusts after world domination,,my motives are not sinister.,I control the brain,in order to understand how it works.,Now wait a minute, you may say,,how can you go straight to controlling the brain,without understanding it first?,Isn't that putting the cart before the horse?,Many neuroscientists agree with this view,and think that understanding will come,from more detailed observation and analysis.,They say, "If we could record the activity of our neurons,,we would understand the brain.",But think for a moment what that means.,Even if we could measure,what every cell is doing at all times,,we would still have to make sense,of the recorded activity patterns,,and that's so difficult,,chances are we'll understand these patterns,just as little as the brains that produce them. 
 Take a look at what brain activity might look like.,In this simulation, each black dot,is one nerve cell.,The dot is visible,whenever a cell fires an electrical impulse.,There's 10,000 neurons here.,So you're looking at roughly one percent,of the brain of a cockroach.,Your brains are about 100 million times,more complicated.,Somewhere, in a pattern like this,,is you,,your perceptions,,your emotions, your memories,,your plans for the future.,But we don't know where,,since we don't know how to read the pattern.,We don't understand the code used by the brain.,To make progress,,we need to break the code.,But how?,An experienced code-breaker will tell you,that in order to figure out what the symbols in a code mean,,it's essential to be able to play with them,,to rearrange them at will.,So in this situation too,,to decode the information,contained in patterns like this,,watching alone won't do.,We need to rearrange the pattern.,In other words,,instead of recording the activity of neurons,,we need to control it.,It's not essential that we can control,the activity of all neurons in the brain, just some.,The more targeted our interventions, the better.,And I'll show you in a moment,how we can achieve the necessary precision. 
 And since I'm realistic, rather than grandiose,,I don't claim that the ability to control the function of the nervous system,will at once unravel all its mysteries.,But we'll certainly learn a lot.,Now, I'm by no means,the first person to realize,how powerful a tool intervention is.,The history of attempts,to tinker with the function of the nervous system,is long and illustrious.,It dates back at least 200 years,,to Galvani's famous experiments,in the late 18th century and beyond.,Galvani showed that a frog's legs twitched,when he connected the lumbar nerve,to a source of electrical current.,This experiment revealed the first, and perhaps most fundamental,,nugget of the neural code:,that information is written in the form,of electrical impulses.,Galvani's approach,of probing the nervous system with electrodes,has remained state-of-the-art until today,,despite a number of drawbacks.,Sticking wires into the brain is obviously rather crude.,It's hard to do in animals that run around,,and there is a physical limit,to the number of wires,that can be inserted simultaneously. 
 So around the turn of the last century,,I started to think,,"Wouldn't it be wonderful if one could take this logic,and turn it upside down?",So instead of inserting a wire,into one spot of the brain,,re-engineer the brain itself,so that some of its neural elements,become responsive to diffusely broadcast signals,such as a flash of light.,Such an approach would literally, in a flash of light,,overcome many of the obstacles to discovery.,First, it's clearly a non-invasive,,wireless form of communication.,And second, just as in a radio broadcast,,you can communicate with many receivers at once.,You don't need to know where these receivers are,,and it doesn't matter if these receivers move --,just think of the stereo in your car.,It gets even better,,for it turns out that we can fabricate the receivers,out of materials that are encoded in DNA.,So each nerve cell,with the right genetic makeup,will spontaneously produce a receiver,that allows us to control its function.,I hope you'll appreciate,the beautiful simplicity,of this concept.,There's no high-tech gizmos here,,just biology revealed through biology. 
 Now let's take a look at these miraculous receivers up close.,As we zoom in on one of these purple neurons,,we see that its outer membrane,is studded with microscopic pores.,Pores like these conduct electrical current,and are responsible,for all the communication in the nervous system.,But these pores here are special.,They are coupled to light receptors,similar to the ones in your eyes.,Whenever a flash of light hits the receptor,,the pore opens, an electrical current is switched on,,and the neuron fires electrical impulses.,Because the light-activated pore is encoded in DNA,,we can achieve incredible precision.,This is because,,although each cell in our bodies,contains the same set of genes,,different mixes of genes get turned on and off,in different cells.,You can exploit this to make sure,that only some neurons,contain our light-activated pore and others don't.,So in this cartoon, the bluish white cell,in the upper-left corner,does not respond to light,because it lacks the light-activated pore.,The approach works so well,that we can write purely artificial messages,directly to the brain.,In this example, each electrical impulse,,each deflection on the trace,,is caused by a brief pulse of light.,And the approach, of course, also works,in moving, behaving animals. 
 This is the first ever such experiment,,sort of the optical equivalent of Galvani's.,It was done six or seven years ago,by my then graduate student, Susana Lima.,Susana had engineered the fruit fly on the left,so that just two out of the 200,000 cells in its brain,expressed the light-activated pore.,You're familiar with these cells,because they are the ones that frustrate you,when you try to swat the fly.,They trained the escape reflex that makes the fly jump into the air,and fly away whenever you move your hand in position.,And you can see here that the flash of light has exactly the same effect.,The animal jumps, it spreads its wings, it vibrates them,,but it can't actually take off,because the fly is sandwiched between two glass plates.,Now to make sure that this was no reaction of the fly,to a flash it could see,,Susana did a simple,but brutally effective experiment.,She cut the heads off of her flies.,These headless bodies can live for about a day,,but they don't do much.,They just stand around,and groom excessively.,So it seems that the only trait that survives decapitation is vanity.,(Laughter),Anyway, as you'll see in a moment,,Susana was able to turn on the flight motor,of what's the equivalent of the spinal cord of these flies,and get some of the headless bodies,to actually take off and fly away.,They didn't get very far, obviously.,Since we took these first steps,,the field of optogenetics has exploded.,And there are now hundreds of labs,using these approaches. 
 And we've come a long way,since Galvani's and Susana's first successes,in making animals twitch or jump.,We can now actually interfere with their psychology,in rather profound ways,,as I'll show you in my last example,,which is directed at a familiar question.,Life is a string of choices,creating a constant pressure to decide what to do next.,We cope with this pressure by having brains,,and within our brains, decision-making centers,that I've called here the "Actor.",The Actor implements a policy that takes into account,the state of the environment,and the context in which we operate.,Our actions change the environment, or context,,and these changes are then fed back into the decision loop. 
 Now to put some neurobiological meat,on this abstract model,,we constructed a simple one-dimensional world,for our favorite subject, fruit flies.,Each chamber in these two vertical stacks,contains one fly.,The left and the right halves of the chamber,are filled with two different odors,,and a security camera watches,as the flies pace up and down between them.,Here's some such CCTV footage.,Whenever a fly reaches the midpoint of the chamber,where the two odor streams meet,,it has to make a decision.,It has to decide whether to turn around,and stay in the same odor,,or whether to cross the midline,and try something new.,These decisions are clearly a reflection,of the Actor's policy.,Now for an intelligent being like our fly,,this policy is not written in stone,but rather changes as the animal learns from experience.,We can incorporate such an element,of adaptive intelligence into our model,by assuming that the fly's brain,contains not only an Actor,,but a different group of cells,,a "Critic," that provides a running commentary,on the Actor's choices.,You can think of this nagging inner voice,as sort of the brain's equivalent,of the Catholic Church,,if you're an Austrian like me,,or the super-ego, if you're Freudian,,or your mother, if you're Jewish. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now obviously,,the Critic is a key ingredient,in what makes us intelligent.,So we set out to identify,the cells in the fly's brain,that played the role of the Critic.,And the logic of our experiment was simple.,We thought if we could use our optical remote control,to activate the cells of the Critic,,we should be able, artificially, to nag the Actor,into changing its policy.,In other words,,the fly should learn from mistakes,that it thought it had made,but, in reality, it had not made.,So we bred flies,whose brains were more or less randomly peppered,with cells that were light addressable.,And then we took these flies,and allowed them to make choices.,And whenever they made one of the two choices,,chose one odor,,in this case the blue one over the orange one,,we switched on the lights.,If the Critic was among the optically activated cells,,the result of this intervention,should be a change in policy.,The fly should learn to avoid,the optically reinforced odor. 
 Here's what happened in two instances:,We're comparing two strains of flies,,each of them having,about 100 light-addressable cells in their brains,,shown here in green on the left and on the right.,What's common among these groups of cells,is that they all produce the neurotransmitter dopamine.,But the identities of the individual,dopamine-producing neurons,are clearly largely different on the left and on the right.,Optically activating,these hundred or so cells,into two strains of flies,has dramatically different consequences.,If you look first at the behavior,of the fly on the right,,you can see that whenever it reaches the midpoint of the chamber,where the two odors meet,,it marches straight through, as it did before.,Its behavior is completely unchanged.,But the behavior of the fly on the left is very different.,Whenever it comes up to the midpoint,,it pauses,,it carefully scans the odor interface,as if it was sniffing out its environment,,and then it turns around.,This means that the policy that the Actor implements,now includes an instruction to avoid the odor,that's in the right half of the chamber.,This means that the Critic,must have spoken in that animal,,and that the Critic must be contained,among the dopamine-producing neurons on the left,,but not among the dopamine producing neurons on the right. 
 Through many such experiments,,we were able to narrow down,the identity of the Critic,to just 12 cells.,These 12 cells, as shown here in green,,send the output to a brain structure,called the "mushroom body,",which is shown here in gray.,We know from our formal model,that the brain structure,at the receiving end of the Critic's commentary is the Actor.,So this anatomy suggests,that the mushroom bodies have something to do,with action choice.,Based on everything we know about the mushroom bodies,,this makes perfect sense.,In fact, it makes so much sense,that we can construct an electronic toy circuit,that simulates the behavior of the fly.,In this electronic toy circuit,,the mushroom body neurons are symbolized,by the vertical bank of blue LEDs,in the center of the board.,These LED's are wired to sensors,that detect the presence of odorous molecules in the air.,Each odor activates a different combination of sensors,,which in turn activates,a different odor detector in the mushroom body.,So the pilot in the cockpit of the fly,,the Actor,,can tell which odor is present,simply by looking at which of the blue LEDs lights up. 
 What the Actor does with this information,depends on its policy,,which is stored in the strengths of the connection,,between the odor detectors,and the motors,that power the fly's evasive actions.,If the connection is weak, the motors will stay off,and the fly will continue straight on its course.,If the connection is strong, the motors will turn on,and the fly will initiate a turn.,Now consider a situation,in which the motors stay off,,the fly continues on its path,and it suffers some painful consequence,such as getting zapped.,In a situation like this,,we would expect the Critic to speak up,and to tell the Actor,to change its policy.,We have created such a situation, artificially,,by turning on the critic with a flash of light.,That caused a strengthening of the connections,between the currently active odor detector,and the motors.,So the next time,the fly finds itself facing the same odor again,,the connection is strong enough to turn on the motors,and to trigger an evasive maneuver. 
 I don't know about you,,but I find it exhilarating to see,how vague psychological notions,evaporate and give rise,to a physical, mechanistic understanding of the mind,,even if it's the mind of the fly.,This is one piece of good news.,The other piece of good news,,for a scientist at least,,is that much remains to be discovered.,In the experiments I told you about,,we have lifted the identity of the Critic,,but we still have no idea,how the Critic does its job.,Come to think of it, knowing when you're wrong,without a teacher, or your mother, telling you,,is a very hard problem.,There are some ideas in computer science,and in artificial intelligence,as to how this might be done,,but we still haven't solved,a single example,of how intelligent behavior,springs from the physical interactions,in living matter.,I think we'll get there in the not too distant future. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)This technology,made a very important impact on us.,It changed the way our history developed.,But it's a technology so pervasive,,so invisible,,that we, for a long time,,forgot to take it into account,when we talked about,human evolution.,But we see the results of this technology, still.,So let's make a little test.,So everyone of you turns to their neighbor please.,Turn and face your neighbors.,Please, also on the balcony.,Smile. Smile. Open the mouths.,Smile, friendly.,(Laughter),Do you --,Do you see any Canine teeth?,(Laughter),Count Dracula teeth,in the mouths of your neighbors?,Of course not.,Because our dental anatomy,is actually made,,not for tearing down raw meat from bones,or chewing fibrous leaves for hours.,It is made for a diet,which is soft, mushy,,which is reduced in fibers,,which is very easily chewable,and digestible.,Sounds like fast food, doesn't it. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's for cooked food.,We carry in our face the proof,that cooking,,food transformation,,made us what we are.,So I would suggest that we change how we classify ourselves.,We talk about ourselves as omnivores.,I would say, we should call ourselves coctivors --,(Laughter),from coquere, to cook.,We are the animals,who eat cooked food.,No, no, no, no. Better --,to live of cooked food.,So cooking is a very important technology.,It's technology.,I don't know how you feel,,but I like to cook for entertainment.,And you need some design,to be successful.,So, cooking is a very important technology,,because it allowed us to acquire,what brought you all here:,the big brain,,this wonderful cerebral cortex we have.,Because brains are expensive.,Those have to pay tuition fees know.,(Laughter),But it's also, metabolically speaking, expensive.,You now, our brain is two to three percent of the body mass,,but actually it uses 25 percent of the total energy we use.,It's very expensive.,Where does the energy come from. Of course, from food.,If we eat raw food,,we cannot release really the energy.,So this ingenuity of our ancestors,,to invent this most marvelous technology.,Invisible -- everyone of us does it every day, so to speak.,Cooking made it possible,that mutations,,natural selections, our environment,,could develop us. 
 So if we think about,this unleashing human potential,,which was possible by cooking and food,,why do we talk so badly about food?,Why is it always do and don'ts,and it's good for you, it's not good for you?,I think the good news for me,would be if we could go back,and talk about the unleashing,,the continuation of the unleashing of human potential.,Now, cooking allowed also,that we became a migrant species.,We walked out of Africa two times.,We populated all the ecologies.,If you can cook, nothing can happen to you,,because whatever you find,,you will try to transform it.,It keeps also your brain working.,Now the very easy and simple technology,which was developed,actually runs after this formula.,Take something which looks like food, transform it,,and it gives you a good, very easy, accessible energy. 
 This technology affected two organs,,the brain and the gut, which it actually affected.,The brain could grow, but the gut actually shrunk.,Okay, it's not obvious to be honest.,(Laughter),But it shrunk to 60 percent,of primate gut,of my body mass.,So because of having cooked food,,it's easier to digest.,Now having a large brain, as you know,,is a big advantage,,because you can actually influence your environment.,You can influence your own technologies you have invented.,You can continue to innovate and invent.,Now the big brain did this also with cooking.,But how did it actually run this show?,How did it actually interfere?,What kind of criteria did it use?,And this is actually taste reward and energy.,You know we have up to five tastes,,three of them sustain us.,Sweet -- energy.,Umami -- this is a meaty taste.,You need proteins for muscles, recovery.,Salty,,because you need salt, otherwise your electric body will not work.,And two tastes which protect you --,bitter and sour,,which are against,poisonous and rotten material.,But of course, they are hard-wired,but we use them still in a sophisticated way.,Think about bittersweet chocolate;,or think about the acidity,of yogurt -- wonderful --,mixed with strawberry fruits. 
 So we can make mixtures of all this kind of thing,because we know,that, in cooking, we can transform it,to the form.,Reward: this is a more complex,and especially integrative,form of our brain,with various different elements --,the external states, our internal states,,how do we feel, and so on are put together.,And something which maybe you don't like,but you are so hungry that you really will be satisfied to eat.,So satisfaction was a very important part.,And as I say, energy was necessary. 
 Now how did the gut actually,participate in this development?,And the gut is a silent voice --,it's going more for feelings.,I use the euphemism digestive comfort --,actually -- it's a digestive discomfort,,which the gut is concerned with.,If you get a stomach ache, if you get a little bit bloated,,was not the right food, was not the right cooking manipulation,or maybe other things went wrong.,So my story is a tale of two brains,,because it might surprise you,,our gut has a full-fledged brain.,All the managers in the room say,,"You don't tell me something new, because we know, gut feeling.,This is what we are using.",(Laughter),And actually you use it and it's actually useful.,Because our gut is connected to our emotional limbic system,,they do speak with each other,and make decisions.,But what it means,to have a brain there,is that, not only the big brain,has to talk with the food,,the food has to talk with the brain,,because we have to learn actually,how to talk to the brains. 
 Now if there's a gut brain,,we should also learn to talk with this brain.,Now 150 years ago,,anatomists described very, very carefully --,here is a model of a wall of a gut.,I took the three elements --,stomach, small intestine and colon.,And within this structure,,you see these two pinkish layers,,which are actually the muscle.,And between this muscle, they found nervous tissues,,a lot of nervous tissues,,which penetrate actually the muscle --,penetrate the submucosa,,where you have all the elements for the immune system.,The gut is actually the largest immune system,,defending your body.,It penetrates the mucosa.,This is the layer which actually touches the food you are swallowing,and you digest,,which is actually the lumen.,Now if you think about the gut,,the gut is -- if you could stretch it --,40 meters long,,the length of a tennis court.,If we could unroll it,,get out all the folds and so on,,it would have 400 sq. meters of surface. 
 And now this brain takes care over this,,to move it with the muscles and to do defend the surface,and, of course, digest our food we cook.,So if we give you a specification,,this brain, which is autonomous,,have 500 million nerve cells,,100 million neurons --,so around the size of a cat brain,,so there sleeps a little cat --,thinks for itself,,optimizes whatever it digests.,It has 20 different neuron types.,It's got the same diversity you find actually in a pig brain,,where you have 100 billion neurons.,It has autonomous organized microcircuits,,has these programs which run.,It senses the food; it knows exactly what to do.,It senses it by chemical means,and very importantly by mechanical means,,because it has to move the food --,it has to mix all the various elements,which we need for digestion.,This control of muscle is very, very important,,because, you know, there can be reflexes.,If you don't like a food, especially if you're a child, you gag.,It's this brain which makes this reflex.,And then finally,,it controls also the secretion of this molecular machinery,,which actually digests the food we cook. 
 Now how do the two brains work with each other?,I took here a model from robotics --,it's called the Subsumption Architecture.,What it means is that we have a layered control system.,The lower layer, our gut brain,,has its own goals -- digestion defense --,and we have the higher brain,with the goal of integration,and generating behaviors.,Now both look -- and this is the blue arrows --,both look to the same food, which is in the lumen,and in the area of your intestine.,The big brain integrates signals,,which come from the running programs,of the lower brain,,But subsumption means,that the higher brain can interfere with the lower.,It can replace,,or it can inhibit actually, signals.,So if we take two types of signals --,a hunger signal for example.,If you have an empty stomach,,your stomach produces a hormone called ghrelin.,It's a very big signal;,it's sent to the brain says,,"Go and eat.",You have stop signals --,we have up to eight stop signals.,At least in my case,,they are not listened to.,(Laughter) 
 So what happens,if the big brain in the integration,overrides the signal?,So if you override the hunger signal,,you can have a disorder, which is called anorexia.,Despite generating,a healthy hunger signal,,the big brain ignores it,and activates different programs in the gut.,The more usual case,is overeating.,It actually takes the signal,and changes it,,and we continue,,even [though] our eight signals would say, "Stop, enough.,We have transferred enough energy.",Now the interesting thing is that,,along this lower layer -- this gut --,the signal becomes stronger and stronger,if undigested, but digestible, material,could penetrate.,This we found from bariatric surgery.,That then the signal would be very, very high. 
 So now back to the cooking question,and back to the design.,We have learned to talk to the big brain --,taste and reward, as you know.,Now what would be the language,we have to talk to the gut brain,that its signals are so strong,that the big brain cannot ignore it?,Then we would generate something,all of us would like to have --,a balance between the hunger,and the satiation.,Now I give you, from our research, a very short claim.,This is fat digestion.,You have on your left,an olive oil droplet,,and this olive oil droplet gets attacked by enzymes.,This is an in vitro experiment.,It's very difficult to work in the intestine.,Now everyone would expect,that when the degradation of the oil happens,,when the constituents are liberated,,they disappear, they go away,because they [were] absorbed.,Actually, what happens is that a very intricate structure appears.,And I hope you can see,that there are some ring-like structures in the middle image,,which is water.,This whole system generates a huge surface,to allow more enzymes,to attack the remaining oil.,And finally, on your right side,,you see a bubbly,,cell-like structure appearing,,from which the body will absorb the fat.,Now if we could take this language --,and this is a language of structures --,and make it longer-lasting,,that it can go through,the passage of the intestine,,it would generate stronger signals. 
 So our research --,and I think the research also at the universities --,are now fixing on these points,to say: how can we actually --,and this might sound trivial now to you --,how can we change cooking?,How can we cook,that we have this language developed?,So what we have actually, it's not an omnivore's dilemma.,We have a coctivor's opportunity,,because we have learned over the last two million years,which taste and reward --,quite sophisticated to cook --,to please ourselves, to satisfy ourselves.,If we add the matrix,,if we add the structure language, which we have to learn,,when we learn it, then we can put it back;,and around energy,,we could generate a balance,,which comes out,from our really primordial operation: cooking.,So, to make cooking really,a very important element,,I would say even philosophers have to change,and have to finally recognize,that cooking is what made us. 
 So I would say, coquo ergo sum:,I cook, therefore I am.,Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)We live on a human-dominated planet,,putting unprecedented pressure,on the systems on Earth.,This is bad news, but perhaps surprising to you,,it's also part of the good news.,We're the first generation -- thanks to science --,to be informed that we may be,undermining the stability and the ability,of planet Earth,to support human development as we know it.,It's also good news, because the planetary risks we're facing,are so large,,that business as usual is not an option.,In fact, we're in a phase,where transformative change is necessary,,which opens the window for innovation,,for new ideas and new paradigms.,This is a scientific journey on the challenges facing humanity,in the global phase of sustainability. 
 On this journey, I'd like to bring, apart from yourselves,,a good friend,,a stakeholder, who's always absent,when we deal with the negotiations on environmental issues,,a stakeholder who refuses to compromise --,planet Earth.,So I thought I'd bring her with me today on stage,,to have her as a witness,of a remarkable journey,,which humbly reminds us,of the period of grace we've had,over the past 10,000 years.,This is the living conditions on the planet over the last 100,000 years.,It's a very important period --,it's roughly half the period when we've been fully modern humans on the planet.,We've had the same, roughly, abilities,that developed civilizations as we know it.,This is the environmental conditions on the planet. 
 Here, used as a proxy, temperature variability.,It was a jumpy ride. 80,000 years back in a crisis,,we leave Africa, we colonize Australia,in another crisis, 60,000 years back,,we leave Asia for Europe,in another crisis, 40,000 years back,,and then we enter,the remarkably stable Holocene phase,,the only period in the whole history of the planet,,that we know of, that can support human development.,A thousand years into this period,,we abandon our hunting and gathering patterns.,We go from a couple of million people,to the seven billion people we are today.,The Mesopotamian culture: we invent agriculture,,we domesticate animals and plants.,You have the Roman, the Greek and the story as you know it.,The only phase, as we know it,that can support humanity. 
 The trouble is we're putting a quadruple sqeeze,on this poor planet,,a quadruple sqeeze, which, as its first squeeze,,has population growth of course.,Now, this is not only about numbers;,this is not only about the fact that we're seven billion people,committed to nine billion people, it's an equity issue as well.,The majority of the environmental impacts on the planet,have been caused by the rich minority,,the 20 percent that jumped onto the industrial bandwagon,in the mid-18th century.,The majority of the planet,,aspiring for development, having the right for development,,are in large aspiring for an unsustainable lifestyle,,a momentous pressure. 
 The second pressure on the planet is, of course the climate agenda --,the big issue -- where the policy interpretation of science,is that it would be enough,to stabilize greenhouse gases at 450 ppm,to avoid average temperatures,exceeding two degrees,,to avoid the risk that we may be destabilizing,the West Antarctic Ice Sheet,,holding six meters -- level rising,,the risk of destabilizing the Greenland Ice Sheet,,holding another seven meters -- sea level rising.,Now, you would have wished the climate pressure,to hit a strong planet, a resilient planet,,but unfortunately, the third pressure,is the ecosystem decline.,Never have we seen, in the past 50 years,,such a sharp decline,of ecosystem functions and services on the planet,,one of them being the ability to regulate climate on the long term,,in our forests, land and biodiversity. 
 The forth pressure is surprise,,the notion and the evidence,that we need to abandon our old paradigm,,that ecosystems behave linearly, predictably,,controllably in our -- so to say -- linear systems,,and that in fact, surprise is universal,,as systems tip over very rapidly, abruptly,and often irreversibly.,This, dear friends, poses a human pressure on the planet,of momentous scale.,We may, in fact, have entered a new geological era --,the Anthropocene,,where humans are the predominant driver of change,at a planetary level. 
 Now, as a scientist,,what's the evidence for this?,Well, the evidence is,,unfortunately, ample.,It's not only carbon dioxide,that has this hockey stick pattern of accelerated change.,You can take virtually any parameter,that matters for human well-being --,nitrous oxide, methane,,deforestation, overfishing,land degredation, loss of species --,they all show the same pattern,over the past 200 years.,Simultaneously, they branch off in the mid-50s,,10 years after the Second World War,,showing very clearly that the great acceleration of the human enterprise,starts in the mid-50s.,You see, for the first time, an imprint on the global level.,And I can tell you,,you enter the disciplinary research in each of these,,you find something remarkably important,,the conclusion that we may have come to the point,where we have to bend the curves,,that we may have entered the most challenging and exciting decade,in the history humanity on the planet,,the decade when we have to bend the curves. 
 Now, as if this was not enough --,to just bend the curves and understanding the accelerated pressure on the planet --,we also have to recognize the fact,that systems do have multiple stable states,,separated by thresholds -- illustrated here by this ball and cup diagram,,where the depth of the cup is the resilience of the system.,Now, the system may gradually --,under pressure of climate change,,erosion, biodiversity loss --,lose the depth of the cup, the resilience,,but appear to be healthy,and appear to suddenly, under a threshold,,be tipping over. Upff.,Sorry. Changing state,and literally ending up,in an undesired situation,,where new biophysical logic takes over,,new species take over, and the system gets locked. 
 Do we have evidence of this? Yes, coral reef systems.,Biodiverse, low-nutrient, hard coral systems,under multiple pressures of overfishing,,unsustainable tourism, climate change.,A trigger and the system tips over,,loses its resilience,,soft corals take over,,and we get undesired systems,that cannot support economic and social development.,The Arctic -- a beautiful system --,a regulating biome at the planetary level,,taking the knock after knock on climate change,,appearing to be in a good state.,No scientist could predict that in 2007,,suddenly, what could be crossing a threshold.,The system suddenly, very surprisingly, loses 30 to 40 percent,of its summer ice cover.,And the drama is, of course, that,when the system does this, the logic may change.,It may get locked in an undesired state,,because it changes color, absorbs more energy,,and the system may get stuck.,In my mind, the largest red flag warning for humanity,that we are in a precarious situation.,As a sideline, you know that the only red flag that popped up here,was a submarine from an unnamed country,that planted a red flag at the bottom of the Arctic,to be able to control the oil resources. 
 Now, if we have evidence, which we now have,,that wetlands, forests,,[unclear] monsoon system, the rainforests,,behave in this nonlinear way.,30 or so scientists around the world,gathered and asked a question for the first time,,"Do we have to put the planet into the the pot?",So we have to ask ourselves:,are we threatening this extraordinarily stable Holocene state?,Are we in fact putting ourselves in a situation,where we're coming too close,to thresholds that could lead,to deleterious and very undesired,,if now catastrophic, change,for human development?,You know, you don't want to stand there.,In fact, you're not even allowed to stand,where this gentleman is standing,,at the foaming, slippery waters at the threshold.,In fact, there's a fence,quite upstream of this threshold,,beyond which you are in a danger zone.,And this is the new paradigm,,which we gathered two, three years back,,recognizing that our old paradigm,of just analyzing and pushing and predicting,parameters into the future,,aiming at minimalizing environmental impacts, is of the past. 
 Now we to ask ourselves:,which are the large environmental processes,that we have to be stewards of,to keep ourselves safe in the Holocene?,And could we even,,thanks to major advancements in Earth systems science,,identify the thresholds,,the points where we may expect nonlinear change?,And could we even define,a planetary boundary, a fence,,within which we then have a safe operating space for humanity?,This work, which was published in "Nature,",late 2009,,after a number of years of analysis,,led to the final proposition,that we can only find,nine planetary boundaries,with which, under active stewardship,,would allow ourselves to have a safe operating space.,These include, of course, climate.,It may surprise you that it's not only climate.,But it shows that we are interconnected, among many systems on the planet,,with the three big systems, climate change,,stratospheric ozone depletion and ocean acidification,being the three big systems,,where the scientific evidence of large-scale thresholds,in the paleo-record of the history of the planet. 
 But we also include, what we call, the slow variables,,the systems that, under the hood,,regulate and buffer the capacity of the resilience of the planet --,the interference of the big nitrogen and phosphorus cycles on the planet,,land use change, rate of biodiversity loss,,freshwater use,,functions which regulate,biomass on the planet, carbon sequestration, diversity.,And then we have two parameters which we were not able to quantify --,air pollution,,including warming gases and air-polluting sulfates and nitrates,,but also chemical pollution.,Together, these form an integrated whole,for guiding human development in the Anthropocene,,understanding that the planet,is a complex self-regulating system.,In fact, most evidence indicates,that these nine may behave as three Musketeers,,"One for all. All for one.",You degrade forests, you go beyond the boundary on land,,you undermine the ability of the climate system,to stay stable.,The drama here is, in fact, that,it may show that the climate challenge,is the easy one,,if you consider the whole challenge,of sustainable development. 
 Now this is the Big Bang equivalent then of human development,within the safe operating space of the planetary boundaries.,What you see here in black line is the safe operating space,,the quantified boundaries,,as suggested by this analysis.,The yellow dot in the middle here is our starting point,,the pre-industrial point,,where we're very safely in the safe operating space.,In the '50s, we start branching out.,In the '60s already, through the green revolution,and the Haber-Bosch process,of fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere --,you know, human's today take out more nitrogen from the atmosphere,than the whole biosphere does naturally as a whole.,We don't transgress the climate boundary until the early '90s,,actually, right after Rio.,And today, we are in a situation where we estimate,that we've transgressed three boundaries,,the rate of biodiversity loss,,which is the sixth extinction period in the history of humanity --,one of them being the extinctions of the dinosaurs --,nitrogen and climate change.,But we still have some degrees of freedom on the others,,but we are approaching fast,on land, water, phosphorus and oceans.,But this gives a new paradigm,to guide humanity,,to put the light on our, so far,overpowered industrial vehicle,,which operates as if,we're only on a dark, straight highway. 
 Now the question then is:,how gloomy is this?,Is then sustainable development utopia?,Well, there's no science to suggest.,In fact, there is ample science,to indicate that we can do this transformative change,,that we have the ability,to now move into a new innovative,,a transformative gear,,across scales.,The drama is, of course,,is that 200 countries on this planet,have to simultaneously start moving,in the same direction.,But it changes fundamentally our governance and management paradigm,,from the current linear,,command and control thinking,,looking at efficiencies and optimization,towards a much more flexible,,a much more adaptive approach,,where we recognize that redundancy,,both in social and environmental systems,,is key to be able to deal,with a turbulent era of global change.,We have to invest in persistence,,in the ability of social systems and ecological systems,to withstand shocks and still remain in that desired cup.,We have to invest in transformations capability,,moving from crisis into innovation,and the ability to rise after a crisis,,and of course to adapt to unavoidable change.,This is a new paradigm.,We're not doing that at any scale on governance. 
 But is it happening anywhere?,Do we have any examples of success,on this mind shift being applied at the local level?,Well, yes, in fact we do,and the list can start becoming longer and longer.,There's good news here,,for example, from Latin America,,where plow-based farming systems,of the '50s and '60s,led farming basically to a dead-end,,with lower and lower yields, degrading the organic matter,and fundamental problems at the livelihood levels,in Paraguay, Uruguay and a number of countries, Brazil,,leading to innovation and entrepreneurship,among farmers in partnership with scientists,into an agricultural revolution of zero tillage systems,combined with mulch farming,with locally adapted technologies,,which today, for example, in some countries,,have led to a tremendous increase,in area under mulch, zero till farming,which, not only produces more food,,but also sequesters carbon. 
 The Australian Great Barrier Reef is another success story.,Under the realization from tourist operators,,fishermen,,the Australian Great Barrier Reef Authority and scientists,that the Great Barrier Reef is doomed,under the current governance regime.,Global change, beautification rack culture,,overfishing and unsustainable tourism,,all together placing this system,in the realization of crisis.,But the window of opportunity was innovation and new mindset,,which today has led to a completely new governance strategy,to build resilience,,acknowledge redundancy,and invest in the whole system as an integrated whole,,and then allow for much more redundancy in the system. 
 Sweden, the country I come from, has other examples,,where wetlands in southern Sweden were seen as --,as in many countries -- as flood-prone polluted nuisance,in the peri-urban regions.,But again, a crisis, new partnerships,,actors locally, transforming these,into a key component,of sustainable urban planning.,So crisis leading into opportunities. 
 Now, what about the future?,Well, the future, of course, has one massive challenge,,which is feeding a world of nine billion people.,We need nothing less than a new green revolution,,and the planet boundaries shows,that agriculture has to go from a source of greenhouse gases to a sink.,It has to basically do this on current land.,We cannot expand anymore,,because it erodes the planetary boundaries.,We cannot continue consuming water as we do today,,with 25 percent of world rivers not even reaching the ocean.,And we need a transformation.,Well, interestingly, and based on my work,and others in Africa, for example,,we've shown that even the most vulnerable small-scale rainfall farming systems,,with innovations and supplementary irrigation,to bridge dry spells and droughts,,sustainable sanitation systems to close the loop on nutrients,from toilets back to farmers' fields,,and innovations in tillage systems,,we can triple, quadruple, yield levels,on current land. 
 Elinor Ostrom,,the latest Nobel laureate of economics,,clearly shows empirically across the world,that we can govern the commons,if we invest in trust,,local, action-based partnerships,and cross-scale institutional innovations,,where local actors,,together, can deal with the global commons,at a large scale.,But even on the hard policy area we have innovations.,We know that we have to move from our fossil dependence,very quickly into a low-carbon economy in record time.,And what shall we do?,Everybody talks about carbon taxes -- it won't work -- emission schemes,,but for example, one policy measure,,feed-in tariffs on the energy system,,which is already applied,,from China doing it on offshore wind systems,,all the way to the U.S.,where you give the guaranteed price for investment in renewable energy,,but you can subsidize electricity to poor people.,You get people out of poverty.,You solve the climate issue with regards to the energy sector,,while at the same time, stimulating innovation --,examples of things that can be out scaled quickly,at the planetary level. 
 So there is -- no doubt -- opportunity here,,and we can list many, many examples,of transformative opportunities around the planet.,The key though in all of these,,the red thread,,is the shift in mindset,,moving away from a situation where we simply are pushing ourselves,into a dark future,,where we instead backcast our future,,and we say, "What is the playing field on the planet?,What are the planetary boundaries,within which we can safely operate?",and then backtrack innovations within that.,But of course, the drama is, it clearly shows,that incremental change is not an option. 
 So, there is scientific evidence.,They sort of say the harsh news,,that we are facing the largest,transformative development,since the industrialization.,In fact, what we have to do over the next 40 years,is much more dramatic and more exciting,than what we did when we moved into,the situation we're in today.,Now, science indicates that,,yes, we can achieve a prosperous future,within the safe operating space,,if we move simultaneously,,collaborating on a global level, from local to global scale,,in transformative options, which build resilience on a finite planet. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Chris Anderson: Julian, welcome.,It's been reported that WikiLeaks, your baby,,has, in the last few years,has released more classified documents,than the rest of the world's media combined.,Can that possibly be true? 
 Julian Assange: Yeah, can it possibly be true?,It's a worry -- isn't it? -- that the rest of the world's media,is doing such a bad job,that a little group of activists,is able to release more,of that type of information,than the rest of the world press combined. 
 CA: How does it work?,How do people release the documents?,And how do you secure their privacy? 
 JA: So these are -- as far as we can tell --,classical whistleblowers,,and we have a number of ways for them,to get information to us.,So we use this state-of-the-art encryption,to bounce stuff around the Internet, to hide trails,,pass it through legal jurisdictions,like Sweden and Belgium,to enact those legal protections.,We get information in the mail,,the regular postal mail,,encrypted or not,,vet it like a regular news organization, format it --,which is sometimes something that's quite hard to do,,when you're talking about,giant databases of information --,release it to the public,and then defend ourselves,against the inevitable legal and political attacks. 
 CA: So you make an effort to ensure,the documents are legitimate,,but you actually,almost never know who the identity of the source is? 
 JA: That's right, yeah. Very rarely do we ever know,,and if we find out at some stage,then we destroy that information as soon as possible.,(Phone ring) God damn it. 
 (Laughter) 
 CA: I think that's the CIA asking what the code is,for a TED membership. 
 (Laughter) 
 So let's take [an] example, actually.,This is something,you leaked a few years ago.,If we can have this document up ...,So this was a story in Kenya a few years ago.,Can you tell us what you leaked and what happened? 
 JA: So this is the Kroll Report.,This was a secret intelligence report,commissioned by the Kenyan government,after its election in 2004.,Prior to 2004, Kenya was ruled,by Daniel arap Moi,for about 18 years.,He was a soft dictator of Kenya.,And when Kibaki got into power --,through a coalition of forces that were trying,to clean up corruption in Kenya --,they commissioned this report,,spent about two million pounds,on this and an associated report.,And then the government sat on it,and used it for political leverage on Moi,,who was the richest man --,still is the richest man -- in Kenya.,It's the Holy Grail of Kenyan journalism.,So I went there in 2007,,and we managed to get hold of this,just prior to the election --,the national election, December 28.,When we released that report,,we did so three days after the new president, Kibaki,,had decided to pal up with,the man that he was going to clean out,,Daniel arap Moi,,so this report then,became a dead albatross,around President Kibaki's neck. 
 CA: And -- I mean, to cut a long story short --,word of the report leaked into Kenya,,not from the official media, but indirectly,,and in your opinion, it actually shifted the election.,JA: Yeah. So this became front page of the Guardian,and was then printed in all the surrounding countries of Kenya,,in Tanzanian and South African press.,And so it came in from the outside.,And that, after a couple of days,,made the Kenyan press feel safe to talk about it.,And it ran for 20 nights straight on Kenyan TV,,shifted the vote by 10 percent,,according to a Kenyan intelligence report,,which changed the result of the election. 
 CA: Wow, so your leak,really substantially changed the world? 
 JA: Yep. 
 (Applause) 
 CA: Here's -- We're going to just show,a short clip from this,Baghdad airstrike video.,The video itself is longer,,but here's a short clip.,This is -- this is intense material, I should warn you. 
 Radio: ... just fuckin', once you get on 'em just open 'em up.,I see your element, uh, got about four Humvees, uh, out along ...,You're clear. All right. Firing.,Let me know when you've got them. Let's shoot.,Light 'em all up.,C'mon, fire!,(Machine gun fire),Keep shoot 'n. Keep shoot 'n.,(Machine gun fire),Keep shoot 'n.,Hotel ... Bushmaster Two-Six, Bushmaster Two-Six,,we need to move, time now!,All right, we just engaged all eight individuals.,Yeah, we see two birds [helicopters], and we're still firing.,Roger. I got 'em.,Two-Six, this is Two-Six, we're mobile.,Oops, I'm sorry. What was going on?,God damn it, Kyle. All right, hahaha. I hit 'em. 
 CA: So, what was the impact of that? 
 JA: The impact on the people who worked on it,was severe.,We ended up sending two people to Baghdad,to further research that story.,So this is just the first of three attacks,that occurred in that scene. 
 CA: So, I mean, 11 people died in that attack, right,,including two Reuters employees? 
 JA: Yeah. Two Reuters employees,,two young children were wounded.,There were between 18 and 26 people killed all together. 
 CA: And releasing this caused,widespread outrage.,What was the key element of this,that actually caused the outrage, do you think? 
 JA: I don't know. I guess people can see,the gross disparity in force.,You have guys walking in a relaxed way down the street,,and then an Apache helicopter sitting up at one kilometer,firing 30-millimeter cannon shells,on everyone --,looking for any excuse to do so --,and killing people rescuing the wounded.,And there was two journalists involved that clearly weren't insurgents,because that's their full-time job. 
 CA: I mean, there's been this U.S. intelligence analyst,,Bradley Manning, arrested,,and it's alleged that he confessed in a chat room,to have leaked this video to you,,along with 280,000,classified U.S. embassy cables.,I mean, did he? 
 JA: We have denied receiving those cables.,He has been charged,,about five days ago,,with obtaining 150,000 cables,and releasing 50.,Now, we had released,,early in the year,,a cable from the Reykjavik U.S. embassy,,but this is not necessarily connected.,I mean, I was a known visitor of that embassy. 
 CA: I mean, if you did receive thousands,of U.S. embassy diplomatic cables ... 
 JA: We would have released them. (CA: You would?) 
 JA: Yeah. (CA: Because?) 
 JA: Well, because these sort of things,reveal what the true state,of, say,,Arab governments are like,,the true human-rights abuses in those governments.,If you look at declassified cables,,that's the sort of material that's there. 
 CA: So let's talk a little more broadly about this.,I mean, in general, what's your philosophy?,Why is it right,to encourage leaking of secret information? 
 JA: Well, there's a question as to what sort of information is important in the world,,what sort of information,can achieve reform.,And there's a lot of information.,So information that organizations,are spending economic effort into concealing,,that's a really good signal,that when the information gets out,,there's a hope of it doing some good --,because the organizations that know it best,,that know it from the inside out,,are spending work to conceal it.,And that's what we've found in practice,,and that's what the history of journalism is. 
 CA: But are there risks with that,,either to the individuals concerned,or indeed to society at large,,where leaking can actually have,an unintended consequence? 
 JA: Not that we have seen with anything we have released.,I mean, we have a harm immunization policy.,We have a way of dealing with information,that has sort of personal --,personally identifying information in it.,But there are legitimate secrets --,you know, your records with your doctor;,that's a legitimate secret --,but we deal with whistleblowers that are coming forward,that are really sort of well-motivated. 
 CA: So they are well-motivated.,And what would you say to, for example,,the, you know, the parent of someone,whose son is out serving the U.S. military,,and he says, "You know what,,you've put up something that someone had an incentive to put out.,It shows a U.S. soldier laughing,at people dying.,That gives the impression, has given the impression,,to millions of people around the world,that U.S. soldiers are inhuman people.,Actually, they're not. My son isn't. How dare you?",What would you say to that? 
 JA: Yeah, we do get a lot of that.,But remember, the people in Baghdad,,the people in Iraq, the people in Afghanistan --,they don't need to see the video;,they see it every day.,So it's not going to change their opinion. It's not going to change their perception.,That's what they see every day.,It will change the perception and opinion,of the people who are paying for it all,,and that's our hope. 
 CA: So you found a way to shine light,into what you see,as these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government.,Light is good.,But do you see any irony in the fact that,,in order for you to shine that light,,you have to, yourself,,create secrecy around your sources? 
 JA: Not really. I mean, we don't have,any WikiLeaks dissidents yet.,We don't have sources who are dissidents on other sources.,Should they come forward, that would be a tricky situation for us,,but we're presumably acting in such a way,that people feel,morally compelled,to continue our mission, not to screw it up. 
 CA: I'd actually be interested, just based on what we've heard so far --,I'm curious as to the opinion in the TED audience.,You know, there might be a couple of views,of WikiLeaks and of Julian.,You know, hero -- people's hero --,bringing this important light.,Dangerous troublemaker.,Who's got the hero view?,Who's got the dangerous troublemaker view? 
 JA: Oh, come on. There must be some. 
 CA: It's a soft crowd, Julian, a soft crowd.,We have to try better. Let's show them another example.,Now here's something that you haven't yet leaked,,but I think for TED you are.,I mean it's an intriguing story that's just happened, right?,What is this? 
 JA: So this is a sample of what we do,sort of every day.,So late last year -- in November last year --,there was a series of well blowouts,in Albania,,like the well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico,,but not quite as big.,And we got a report --,a sort of engineering analysis into what happened --,saying that, in fact, security guards,from some rival, various competing oil firms,had, in fact, parked trucks there and blown them up.,And part of the Albanian government was in this, etc., etc.,And the engineering report,had nothing on the top of it,,so it was an extremely difficult document for us.,We couldn't verify it because we didn't know,who wrote it and knew what it was about.,So we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was,a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up.,So under that basis, we put it out and said,,"Look, we're skeptical about this thing.,We don't know, but what can we do?,The material looks good, it feels right,,but we just can't verify it.",And we then got a letter,just this week,from the company who wrote it,,wanting to track down the source --,(Laughter),saying, "Hey, we want to track down the source.",And we were like, "Oh, tell us more.,What document is it, precisely, you're talking about?,Can you show that you had legal authority over that document?,Is it really yours?",So they sent us this screen shot,with the author,in the Microsoft Word ID.,Yeah.,(Applause),That's happened quite a lot though.,This is like one of our methods,of identifying, of verifying, what a material is,,is to try and get these guys to write letters. 
 CA: Yeah. Have you had information,from inside BP? 
 JA: Yeah, we have a lot, but I mean, at the moment,,we are undergoing a sort of serious fundraising and engineering effort.,So our publication rate,over the past few months,has been sort of minimized,while we're re-engineering our back systems,for the phenomenal public interest that we have.,That's a problem.,I mean, like any sort of growing startup organization,,we are sort of overwhelmed,by our growth,,and that means we're getting enormous quantity,of whistleblower disclosures,of a very high caliber,but don't have enough people to actually,process and vet this information. 
 CA: So that's the key bottleneck,,basically journalistic volunteers,and/or the funding of journalistic salaries? 
 JA: Yep. Yeah, and trusted people.,I mean, we're an organization,that is hard to grow very quickly,because of the sort of material we deal with,,so we have to restructure,in order to have people,who will deal with the highest national security stuff,,and then lower security cases. 
 CA: So help us understand a bit about you personally,and how you came to do this.,And I think I read that as a kid,you went to 37 different schools.,Can that be right? 
 JA: Well, my parents were in the movie business,and then on the run from a cult,,so the combination between the two ... 
 (Laughter) 
 CA: I mean, a psychologist might say,that's a recipe for breeding paranoia. 
 JA: What, the movie business? 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 CA: And you were also -- I mean,,you were also a hacker at an early age,and ran into the authorities early on.,JA: Well, I was a journalist.,You know, I was a very young journalist activist at an early age.,I wrote a magazine,,was prosecuted for it when I was a teenager.,So you have to be careful with hacker.,I mean there's like -- there's a method,that can be deployed for various things.,Unfortunately, at the moment,,it's mostly deployed by the Russian mafia,in order to steal your grandmother's bank accounts.,So this phrase is not,,not as nice as it used to be. 
 CA: Yeah, well, I certainly don't think,you're stealing anyone's grandmother's bank account,,but what about,your core values?,Can you give us a sense of what they are,and maybe some incident in your life,that helped determine them? 
 JA: I'm not sure about the incident.,But the core values:,well, capable, generous men,do not create victims;,they nurture victims.,And that's something from my father,and something from other capable, generous men,that have been in my life. 
 CA: Capable, generous men do not create victims;,they nurture victims? 
 JA: Yeah. And you know,,I'm a combative person,,so I'm not actually so big on the nurture,,but some way --,there is another way of nurturing victims,,which is to police perpetrators,of crime.,And so that is something,that has been in my character,for a long time. 
 CA: So just tell us, very quickly in the last minute, the story:,what happened in Iceland?,You basically published something there,,ran into trouble with a bank,,then the news service there,was injuncted from running the story.,Instead, they publicized your side.,That made you very high-profile in Iceland. What happened next? 
 JA: Yeah, this is a great case, you know.,Iceland went through this financial crisis.,It was the hardest hit of any country in the world.,Its banking sector was 10 times the GDP,of the rest of the economy.,Anyway, so we release this report,in July last year.,And the national TV station was injuncted,five minutes before it went on air,,like out of a movie: injunction landed on the news desk,,and the news reader was like,,"This has never happened before. What do we do?",Well, we just show the website instead,,for all that time, as a filler,,and we became very famous in Iceland,,went to Iceland and spoke about this issue.,And there was a feeling in the community,that that should never happen again,,and as a result,,working with Icelandic politicians,and some other international legal experts,,we put together a new sort of,package of legislation for Iceland,to sort of become an offshore haven,for the free press,,with the strongest journalistic protections in the world,,with a new Nobel Prize,for freedom of speech.,Iceland's a Nordic country,,so, like Norway, it's able to tap into the system.,And just a month ago,,this was passed by the Icelandic parliament unanimously. 
 CA: Wow. 
 (Applause) 
 Last question, Julian.,When you think of the future then,,do you think it's more likely to be,Big Brother exerting more control,,more secrecy,,or us watching,Big Brother,,or it's just all to be played for either way? 
 JA: I'm not sure which way it's going to go.,I mean, there's enormous pressures,to harmonize freedom of speech legislation,and transparency legislation around the world --,within the E.U.,,between China and the United States.,Which way is it going to go? It's hard to see.,That's why it's a very interesting time to be in --,because with just a little bit of effort,,we can shift it one way or the other. 
 CA: Well, it looks like I'm reflecting the audience's opinion,to say, Julian, be careful,,and all power to you. 
 JA: Thank you, Chris. (CA: Thank you.) 
 (Applause)I want to start my talk today with two observations,about the human species.,The first observation is something that you might think is quite obvious,,and that's that our species, Homo sapiens,,is actually really, really smart --,like, ridiculously smart --,like you're all doing things,that no other species on the planet does right now.,And this is, of course,,not the first time you've probably recognized this.,Of course, in addition to being smart, we're also an extremely vain species.,So we like pointing out the fact that we're smart.,You know, so I could turn to pretty much any sage,from Shakespeare to Stephen Colbert,to point out things like the fact that,we're noble in reason and infinite in faculties,and just kind of awesome-er than anything else on the planet,when it comes to all things cerebral. 
 But of course, there's a second observation about the human species,that I want to focus on a little bit more,,and that's the fact that,even though we're actually really smart, sometimes uniquely smart,,we can also be incredibly, incredibly dumb,when it comes to some aspects of our decision making.,Now I'm seeing lots of smirks out there.,Don't worry, I'm not going to call anyone in particular out,on any aspects of your own mistakes.,But of course, just in the last two years,we see these unprecedented examples of human ineptitude.,And we've watched as the tools we uniquely make,to pull the resources out of our environment,kind of just blow up in our face.,We've watched the financial markets that we uniquely create --,these markets that were supposed to be foolproof --,we've watched them kind of collapse before our eyes. 
 But both of these two embarrassing examples, I think,,don't highlight what I think is most embarrassing,about the mistakes that humans make,,which is that we'd like to think that the mistakes we make,are really just the result of a couple bad apples,or a couple really sort of FAIL Blog-worthy decisions.,But it turns out, what social scientists are actually learning,is that most of us, when put in certain contexts,,will actually make very specific mistakes.,The errors we make are actually predictable.,We make them again and again.,And they're actually immune to lots of evidence.,When we get negative feedback,,we still, the next time we're face with a certain context,,tend to make the same errors.,And so this has been a real puzzle to me,as a sort of scholar of human nature.,What I'm most curious about is,,how is a species that's as smart as we are,capable of such bad,and such consistent errors all the time? 
 You know, we're the smartest thing out there, why can't we figure this out?,In some sense, where do our mistakes really come from?,And having thought about this a little bit, I see a couple different possibilities.,One possibility is, in some sense, it's not really our fault.,Because we're a smart species,,we can actually create all kinds of environments,that are super, super complicated,,sometimes too complicated for us to even actually understand,,even though we've actually created them.,We create financial markets that are super complex.,We create mortgage terms that we can't actually deal with.,And of course, if we are put in environments where we can't deal with it,,in some sense makes sense that we actually,might mess certain things up.,If this was the case, we'd have a really easy solution,to the problem of human error.,We'd actually just say, okay, let's figure out,the kinds of technologies we can't deal with,,the kinds of environments that are bad --,get rid of those, design things better,,and we should be the noble species,that we expect ourselves to be. 
 But there's another possibility that I find a little bit more worrying,,which is, maybe it's not our environments that are messed up.,Maybe it's actually us that's designed badly.,This is a hint that I've gotten,from watching the ways that social scientists have learned about human errors.,And what we see is that people tend to keep making errors,exactly the same way, over and over again.,It feels like we might almost just be built,to make errors in certain ways.,This is a possibility that I worry a little bit more about,,because, if it's us that's messed up,,it's not actually clear how we go about dealing with it.,We might just have to accept the fact that we're error prone,and try to design things around it. 
 So this is the question my students and I wanted to get at.,How can we tell the difference between possibility one and possibility two?,What we need is a population,that's basically smart, can make lots of decisions,,but doesn't have access to any of the systems we have,,any of the things that might mess us up --,no human technology, human culture,,maybe even not human language.,And so this is why we turned to these guys here.,These are one of the guys I work with. This is a brown capuchin monkey.,These guys are New World primates,,which means they broke off from the human branch,about 35 million years ago.,This means that your great, great, great great, great, great --,with about five million "greats" in there --,grandmother was probably the same great, great, great, great,grandmother with five million "greats" in there,as Holly up here.,You know, so you can take comfort in the fact that this guy up here is a really really distant,,but albeit evolutionary, relative.,The good news about Holly though is that,she doesn't actually have the same kinds of technologies we do.,You know, she's a smart, very cut creature, a primate as well,,but she lacks all the stuff we think might be messing us up.,So she's the perfect test case. 
 What if we put Holly into the same context as humans?,Does she make the same mistakes as us?,Does she not learn from them? And so on.,And so this is the kind of thing we decided to do.,My students and I got very excited about this a few years ago.,We said, all right, let's, you know, throw so problems at Holly,,see if she messes these things up.,First problem is just, well, where should we start?,Because, you know, it's great for us, but bad for humans.,We make a lot of mistakes in a lot of different contexts.,You know, where are we actually going to start with this?,And because we started this work around the time of the financial collapse,,around the time when foreclosures were hitting the news,,we said, hhmm, maybe we should,actually start in the financial domain.,Maybe we should look at monkey's economic decisions,and try to see if they do the same kinds of dumb things that we do. 
 Of course, that's when we hit a sort second problem --,a little bit more methodological --,which is that, maybe you guys don't know,,but monkeys don't actually use money. I know, you haven't met them.,But this is why, you know, they're not in the queue behind you,at the grocery store or the ATM -- you know, they don't do this stuff.,So now we faced, you know, a little bit of a problem here.,How are we actually going to ask monkeys about money,if they don't actually use it?,So we said, well, maybe we should just, actually just suck it up,and teach monkeys how to use money.,So that's just what we did.,What you're looking at over here is actually the first unit that I know of,of non-human currency.,We weren't very creative at the time we started these studies,,so we just called it a token.,But this is the unit of currency that we've taught our monkeys at Yale,to actually use with humans,,to actually buy different pieces of food.,It doesn't look like much -- in fact, it isn't like much. 
 Like most of our money, it's just a piece of metal.,As those of you who've taken currencies home from your trip know,,once you get home, it's actually pretty useless.,It was useless to the monkeys at first,before they realized what they could do with it.,When we first gave it to them in their enclosures,,they actually kind of picked them up, looked at them.,They were these kind of weird things.,But very quickly, the monkeys realized,that they could actually hand these tokens over,to different humans in the lab for some food.,And so you see one of our monkeys, Mayday, up here doing this.,This is A and B are kind of the points where she's sort of a little bit,curious about these things -- doesn't know.,There's this waiting hand from a human experimenter,,and Mayday quickly figures out, apparently the human wants this.,Hands it over, and then gets some food.,It turns out not just Mayday, all of our monkeys get good,at trading tokens with human salesman.,So here's just a quick video of what this looks like.,Here's Mayday. She's going to be trading a token for some food,and waiting happily and getting her food.,Here's Felix, I think. He's our alpha male; he's a kind of big guy.,But he too waits patiently, gets his food and goes on. 
 So the monkeys get really good at this.,They're surprisingly good at this with very little training.,We just allowed them to pick this up on their own.,The question is: is this anything like human money?,Is this a market at all,,or did we just do a weird psychologist's trick,by getting monkeys to do something,,looking smart, but not really being smart.,And so we said, well, what would the monkeys spontaneously do,if this was really their currency, if they were really using it like money?,Well, you might actually imagine them,to do all the kinds of smart things,that humans do when they start exchanging money with each other.,You might have them start paying attention to price,,paying attention to how much they buy --,sort of keeping track of their monkey token, as it were.,Do the monkeys do anything like this? 
 And so our monkey marketplace was born.,The way this works is that,our monkeys normally live in a kind of big zoo social enclosure.,When they get a hankering for some treats,,we actually allowed them a way out,into a little smaller enclosure where they could enter the market.,Upon entering the market --,it was actually a much more fun market for the monkeys than most human markets,because, as the monkeys entered the door of the market,,a human would give them a big wallet full of tokens,so they could actually trade the tokens,with one of these two guys here --,two different possible human salesmen,that they could actually buy stuff from.,The salesmen were students from my lab.,They dressed differently; they were different people.,And over time, they did basically the same thing,so the monkeys could learn, you know,,who sold what at what price -- you know, who was reliable, who wasn't, and so on.,And you can see that each of the experimenters,is actually holding up a little, yellow food dish.,and that's what the monkey can for a single token.,So everything costs one token,,but as you can see, sometimes tokens buy more than others,,sometimes more grapes than others. 
 So I'll show you a quick video of what this marketplace actually looks like.,Here's a monkey-eye-view. Monkeys are shorter, so it's a little short.,But here's Honey.,She's waiting for the market to open a little impatiently.,All of a sudden the market opens. Here's her choice: one grapes or two grapes.,You can see Honey, very good market economist,,goes with the guy who gives more.,She could teach our financial advisers a few things or two.,So not just Honey,,most of the monkeys went with guys who had more.,Most of the monkeys went with guys who had better food.,When we introduced sales, we saw the monkeys paid attention to that.,They really cared about their monkey token dollar.,The more surprising thing was that when we collaborated with economists,to actually look at the monkeys' data using economic tools,,they basically matched, not just qualitatively,,but quantitatively with what we saw,humans doing in a real market.,So much so that, if you saw the monkeys' numbers,,you couldn't tell whether they came from a monkey or a human in the same market. 
 And what we'd really thought we'd done,is like we'd actually introduced something,that, at least for the monkeys and us,,works like a real financial currency.,Question is: do the monkeys start messing up in the same ways we do?,Well, we already saw anecdotally a couple of signs that they might.,One thing we never saw in the monkey marketplace,was any evidence of saving --,you know, just like our own species.,The monkeys entered the market, spent their entire budget,and then went back to everyone else.,The other thing we also spontaneously saw,,embarrassingly enough,,is spontaneous evidence of larceny.,The monkeys would rip-off the tokens at every available opportunity --,from each other, often from us --,you know, things we didn't necessarily think we were introducing,,but things we spontaneously saw. 
 So we said, this looks bad.,Can we actually see if the monkeys,are doing exactly the same dumb things as humans do?,One possibility is just kind of let,the monkey financial system play out,,you know, see if they start calling us for bailouts in a few years.,We were a little impatient so we wanted,to sort of speed things up a bit.,So we said, let's actually give the monkeys,the same kinds of problems,that humans tend to get wrong,in certain kinds of economic challenges,,or certain kinds of economic experiments.,And so, since the best way to see how people go wrong,is to actually do it yourself,,I'm going to give you guys a quick experiment,to sort of watch your own financial intuitions in action. 
 So imagine that right now,I handed each and every one of you,a thousand U.S. dollars -- so 10 crisp hundred dollar bills.,Take these, put it in your wallet,and spend a second thinking about what you're going to do with it.,Because it's yours now; you can buy whatever you want.,Donate it, take it, and so on.,Sounds great, but you get one more choice to earn a little bit more money.,And here's your choice: you can either be risky,,in which case I'm going to flip one of these monkey tokens.,If it comes up heads, you're going to get a thousand dollars more.,If it comes up tails, you get nothing.,So it's a chance to get more, but it's pretty risky.,Your other option is a bit safe. Your just going to get some money for sure.,I'm just going to give you 500 bucks.,You can stick it in your wallet and use it immediately.,So see what your intuition is here.,Most people actually go with the play-it-safe option.,Most people say, why should I be risky when I can get 1,500 dollars for sure?,This seems like a good bet. I'm going to go with that.,You might say, eh, that's not really irrational.,People are a little risk-averse. So what? 
 Well, the "so what?" comes when start thinking,about the same problem,set up just a little bit differently.,So now imagine that I give each and every one of you,2,000 dollars -- 20 crisp hundred dollar bills.,Now you can buy double to stuff you were going to get before.,Think about how you'd feel sticking it in your wallet.,And now imagine that I have you make another choice,But this time, it's a little bit worse.,Now, you're going to be deciding how you're going to lose money,,but you're going to get the same choice.,You can either take a risky loss --,so I'll flip a coin. If it comes up heads, you're going to actually lose a lot.,If it comes up tails, you lose nothing, you're fine, get to keep the whole thing --,or you could play it safe, which means you have to reach back into your wallet,and give me five of those $100 bills, for certain. 
 And I'm seeing a lot of furrowed brows out there.,So maybe you're having the same intuitions,as the subjects that were actually tested in this,,which is when presented with these options,,people don't choose to play it safe.,They actually tend to go a little risky.,The reason this is irrational is that we've given people in both situations,the same choice.,It's a 50/50 shot of a thousand or 2,000,,or just 1,500 dollars with certainty.,But people's intuitions about how much risk to take,varies depending on where they started with. 
 So what's going on?,Well, it turns out that this seems to be the result,of at least two biases that we have at the psychological level.,One is that we have a really hard time thinking in absolute terms.,You really have to do work to figure out,,well, one option's a thousand, 2,000;,one is 1,500.,Instead, we find it very easy to think in very relative terms,as options change from one time to another.,So we think of things as, "Oh, I'm going to get more," or "Oh, I'm going to get less.",This is all well and good, except that,changes in different directions,actually effect whether or not we think,options are good or not.,And this leads to the second bias,,which economists have called loss aversion. 
 The idea is that we really hate it when things go into the red.,We really hate it when we have to lose out on some money.,And this means that sometimes we'll actually,switch our preferences to avoid this.,What you saw in that last scenario is that,subjects get risky,because they want the small shot that there won't be any loss.,That means when we're in a risk mindset --,excuse me, when we're in a loss mindset,,we actually become more risky,,which can actually be really worrying.,These kinds of things play out in lots of bad ways in humans.,They're why stock investors hold onto losing stocks longer --,because they're evaluating them in relative terms.,They're why people in the housing market refused to sell their house --,because they don't want to sell at a loss. 
 The question we were interested in,is whether the monkeys show the same biases.,If we set up those same scenarios in our little monkey market,,would they do the same thing as people?,And so this is what we did, we gave the monkeys choices,between guys who were safe -- they did the same thing every time --,or guys who were risky --,they did things differently half the time.,And then we gave them options that were bonuses --,like you guys did in the first scenario --,so they actually have a chance more,,or pieces where they were experiencing losses --,they actually thought they were going to get more than they really got. 
 And so this is what this looks like.,We introduced the monkeys to two new monkey salesmen.,The guy on the left and right both start with one piece of grape,,so it looks pretty good.,But they're going to give the monkeys bonuses.,The guy on the left is a safe bonus.,All the time, he adds one, to give the monkeys two.,The guy on the right is actually a risky bonus.,Sometimes the monkeys get no bonus -- so this is a bonus of zero.,Sometimes the monkeys get two extra.,For a big bonus, now they get three.,But this is the same choice you guys just faced.,Do the monkeys actually want to play it safe,and then go with the guy who's going to do the same thing on every trial,,or do they want to be risky,and try to get a risky, but big, bonus,,but risk the possibility of getting no bonus.,People here played it safe.,Turns out, the monkeys play it safe too.,Qualitatively and quantitatively,,they choose exactly the same way as people,,when tested in the same thing. 
 You might say, well, maybe the monkeys just don't like risk.,Maybe we should see how they do with losses.,And so we ran a second version of this.,Now, the monkeys meet two guys,who aren't giving them bonuses;,they're actually giving them less than they expect.,So they look like they're starting out with a big amount.,These are three grapes; the monkey's really psyched for this.,But now they learn these guys are going to give them less than they expect.,They guy on the left is a safe loss.,Every single time, he's going to take one of these away,and give the monkeys just two.,the guy on the right is the risky loss.,Sometimes he gives no loss, so the monkeys are really psyched,,but sometimes he actually gives a big loss,,taking away two to give the monkeys only one. 
 And so what do the monkeys do?,Again, same choice; they can play it safe,for always getting two grapes every single time,,or they can take a risky bet and choose between one and three.,The remarkable thing to us is that, when you give monkeys this choice,,they do the same irrational thing that people do.,They actually become more risky,depending on how the experimenters started.,This is crazy because it suggests that the monkeys too,are evaluating things in relative terms,and actually treating losses differently than they treat gains. 
 So what does all of this mean?,Well, what we've shown is that, first of all,,we can actually give the monkeys a financial currency,,and they do very similar things with it.,They do some of the smart things we do,,some of the kind of not so nice things we do,,like steal it and so on.,But they also do some of the irrational things we do.,They systematically get things wrong,and in the same ways that we do.,This is the first take-home message of the Talk,,which is that if you saw the beginning of this and you thought,,oh, I'm totally going to go home and hire a capuchin monkey financial adviser.,They're way cuter than the one at ... you know --,Don't do that; they're probably going to be just as dumb,as the human one you already have.,So, you know, a little bad -- Sorry, sorry, sorry.,A little bad for monkey investors. 
 But of course, you know, the reason you're laughing is bad for humans too.,Because we've answered the question we started out with.,We wanted to know where these kinds of errors came from.,And we started with the hope that maybe we can,sort of tweak our financial institutions,,tweak our technologies to make ourselves better.,But what we've learn is that these biases might be a deeper part of us than that.,In fact, they might be due to the very nature,of our evolutionary history.,You know, maybe it's not just humans,at the right side of this chain that's duncey.,Maybe it's sort of duncey all the way back.,And this, if we believe the capuchin monkey results,,means that these duncey strategies,might be 35 million years old.,That's a long time for a strategy,to potentially get changed around -- really, really old. 
 What do we know about other old strategies like this?,Well, one thing we know is that they tend to be really hard to overcome.,You know, think of our evolutionary predilection,for eating sweet things, fatty things like cheesecake.,You can't just shut that off.,You can't just look at the dessert cart as say, "No, no, no. That looks disgusting to me.",We're just built differently.,We're going to perceive it as a good thing to go after.,My guess is that the same thing is going to be true,when humans are perceiving,different financial decisions.,When you're watching your stocks plummet into the red,,when you're watching your house price go down,,you're not going to be able to see that,in anything but old evolutionary terms.,This means that the biases,that lead investors to do badly,,that lead to the foreclosure crisis,are going to be really hard to overcome. 
 So that's the bad news. The question is: is there any good news?,I'm supposed to be up here telling you the good news.,Well, the good news, I think,,is what I started with at the beginning of the Talk,,which is that humans are not only smart;,we're really inspirationally smart,to the rest of the animals in the biological kingdom.,We're so good at overcoming our biological limitations --,you know, I flew over here in an airplane.,I didn't have to try to flap my wings.,I'm wearing contact lenses now so that I can see all of you.,I don't have to rely on my own near-sightedness.,We actually have all of these cases,where we overcome our biological limitations,through technology and other means, seemingly pretty easily.,But we have to recognize that we have those limitations. 
 And here's the rub.,It was Camus who once said that, "Man is the only species,who refuses to be what he really is.",But the irony is that,it might only be in recognizing our limitations,that we can really actually overcome them.,The hope is that you all will think about your limitations,,not necessarily as unovercomable,,but to recognize them, accept them,and then use the world of design to actually figure them out.,That might be the only way that we will really be able,to achieve our own human potential,and really be the noble species we hope to all be. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I was one of the founding membersnof the Axis of Evil Comedy Tour.,The other founding membersnincluded Ahmed Ahmed,,who is an Egyptian-American,nwho actually had the idea,to go to the Middle East and try it outnbefore we went out as a tour.,He went out solo and did it first.,Then there was Aron Kader,nwho was the Palestinian-American.,And then there was me,nthe Iranian-American of the group.,Now, being Iranian-Americannpresents its own set of problems,,as you know.,Those two countriesnaren't getting along these days.,So it causes a lot of innernconflict, you know,,like part of me likes me,npart of me hates me. 
 (Laughter) 
 Part of me thinks I shouldnhave a nuclear program,,the other part thinksnI can't be trusted with one.,These are dilemmas I have every day. 
 But I was born in Iran;nI'm now an American citizen,,which means I have the American passport,,which means I can travel.,Because if you only haventhe Iranian passport,,you're kind of limited to the countriesnyou can go to with open arms,,you know -- Syria, Venezuela, North Korea. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, anyone who's gotten their passportnin America will tell you,,when you get it, it still saysnwhat country you were born in.,So I remember gettingnmy American passport.,I was like, "Woo-hoo!nI'm going to travel.",And I opened it up, it said, "Bornnin Iran." I'm like, "Oh, come on, man!" 
 (Laughter) 
 "I'm trying to go places." 
 (Laughter) 
 But what's interesting is,,I've never had trouble in any Westernncountries with my American passport,,even though it says,n"Born in Iran" -- no problems.,Where I've had problemsnis in some of the Arab countries.,I guess some of the Arab countriesnaren't getting along with Iran either.,So I was in Kuwait recently,ndoing a comedy show,with some other American comedians.,They all went through.,Then the border patrol saw my Americannpassport: "Ah-ha! American, great.",Then he opened it up.n"Born in Iran? Wait." 
 (Laughter) 
 And he started asking me questions.,He said, "What is your father's name?",I said, "Well, he's passed away,nbut his name was Khosro.",He goes, "Whatnis your grandfather's name?",I said, "He passed away a long time ago.,His name was Jabbar.",He says, "You wait. I'll be back,"nand he walked away.,And I started freaking out,,because I don't know what kindnof crap my grandfather was into. 
 (Laughter) 
 Thought the guy was goingnto come back and be like,,"We've been lookingnfor you for 200 years." 
 (Laughter) 
 "Your grandfather hasna parking violation. It's way overdue.,You owe us two billion dollars." 
 (Laughter) 
 But as you can see, when I talk,nI speak with an American accent,,which you would think,nas an Iranian-American actor,,I should be able to play any part,ngood, bad, what have you.,But a lot of times in Hollywood,,when casting directors find outnyou're of Middle Eastern descent,,they go, "Oh, you're Iranian. Great!,Can you say 'I will kill younin the name of Allah?'",I go, "I could say that,nbut what if I were to say,,'Hello. I'm your doctor'?",They go, "Great! And thennyou hijack the hospital." 
 (Laughter) 
 Like, I think you'renmissing the point here.,Don't get me wrong,nI don't mind playing bad guys.,I want to play a bad guy.nI want to rob a bank.,I want to rob a bank in a film,,but do it with a gun, not with a bombnstrapped around me, right? 
 (Laughter) 
 Because I imagine the director:n"Maz, I think your character,would rob the banknwith a bomb around him.","Why would I do that?,If I want the money,nwhy would I kill myself?" 
 (Laughter) 
 Right? 
 (Applause),"Gimme all your money,nor I'll blow myself up!" 
 (Laughter) 
 "Well, then blow yourself up. 
 (Laughter) 
 Just do it outside, please." 
 (Laughter) 
 But the fact is, there's goodnpeople everywhere.,That's what I try and show in my stand-up,ngood people everywhere.,All it takes in one person to mess it up.,Like a couple months agonin Times Square in New York,,there was a Pakistani Muslim guynwho tried to blow up a car bomb.,Now, I happened to be in Times Squarenthat night doing a comedy show.,And a few months before that, therenwas a white American guy in Austin, Texas,who flew his airplaneninto the IRS building,,and I happened to be in Austin that dayndoing a stand-up comedy show.,Now I'll tell you,nas a Middle-Eastern male,,when you show up around a lotnof these activities,,you start feeling guilty at one point. 
 (Laughter) 
 I was watching the news. I'm like,n"Am I involved in this crap?" 
 (Laughter) 
 "I didn't get the memo. What's going on?" 
 (Laughter) 
 But what was interesting was,,the Pakistani Muslim guy --nsee, he gives a bad name to Muslims,and Middle Easterners and Pakistanisnfrom all over the world.,And one thing that happened therenwas also the Pakistani Taliban,took credit for that failed car bombing.,My question is: Why would you take creditnfor a failed car bombing?,"We just want to say:,we tried." 
 (Laughter) 
 "And furthermore ... 
 (Laughter) 
 it is the thought that counts." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 "And in conclusion, win some, lose some." 
 (Laughter) 
 But what happened was, when the white guynflew his plane into the building,,I know all my Middle Easternnand Muslim friends in the States,were watching TV, going,,"Please, don't be Middle Eastern.nDon't be Hassan or Hussein.",And the name came out: Jack.nI'm like, "Woooo! That's not one of us!",But I kept watching the newsnin case they came back,,and were like, "Before he did it,nhe converted to Islam.","Damn it! Why Jack? Why?" 
 But the fact is, I've been lucky,to get a chance to performnall over the world,,and I did a lot of showsnin the Middle East.,I just did a seven-country solo tour.,I was in Oman, and I was in Saudi Arabia.,I was in Dubai.,And it's great, there's goodnpeople everywhere.,And you learn great thingsnabout these places.,I encourage people alwaysnto go visit these places.,For example, Dubai -- cool place.,They're obsessed with having the biggest,ntallest, longest, as we all know.,They have a mall there, the Dubai Mall.,It is so big, they have taxis in the mall.,I was walking. I heard, "Beep! Beep!"nI'm like, "What are you doing here?",He goes, "I'm going to the Zara store.nIt's three miles away.,Out of my way. Out of my way.nOut of my way." 
 (Laughter) 
 And what's crazy -- there's a recessionngoing on, even in Dubai,,but you wouldn't know by the prices.,Like in the Dubai Mall,nthey sell frozen yogurt by the gram.,It's like a drug deal.,I was walking by. The guy goes,n"Psst! Habibi, my friend." 
 (Laughter) 
 "You want some frozen yogurt? 
 (Laughter) 
 Come here. Come here. Come here.,I have one gram, five gram, 10 gram.nHow many gram do you want?" 
 (Laughter) 
 I bought five grams. 10 dollars.n10 dollars! I said, "What's in this?",He's like, "Good stuff, man.nColombian. Top of the line." 
 (Laughter) 
 The other thing you learnnwhen you travel in these countries,,in the Middle East, Latin American,nSouth American countries,,a lot of times when they build stuff,nthere's no rules and regulations.,For example, I took my two-year-old sonnto the playground at the Dubai Mall.,And I've taken him to playgroundsnall over the United States.,And when you put your two-year-oldnon a slide in the United States,,they put something on the slide,to slow the kid downnas he comes down the slide.,Not in the Middle East. 
 (Laughter) 
 I put my two-year-old on the slide,nhe went whoosh! He took off! 
 (Laughter) 
 I went down and, "Where's my son?"n"On the third floor, sir. Third floor." 
 (Laughter) 
 "You take a taxi.nYou go to Zara. Make a left." 
 (Laughter) 
 "Try the yogurt. It's very good.nLittle expensive." 
 (Laughter) 
 But one thing I try to donwith my stand-up is break stereotypes.,And I've been guiltynof stereotyping as well.,I was in Dubai. And there's a lotnof Indians who work in Dubai.,And they don't get paid that well.,And I got it in my head that allnthe Indians must be workers.,I forgot there's obviouslynsuccessful Indians in Dubai too.,I was doing a show, and they said,n"We'll send a driver to pick you up.",I went down to the lobby,nand saw this Indian guy.,I go, "He must be my driver,",since he's standing there in a cheapnsuit, thin mustache, staring at me.,I say, "Excuse me, are you my driver?",He goes, "No, sir. I own the hotel." 
 (Laughter) 
 I go, "I'm sorry!nWhy were you staring at me?",He goes, "I thought you were my driver." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 (Laughter) 
 I'll leave you with this: I try,nwith my stand-up, to break stereotypes,,present Middle Easternersnand Muslims in a positive light.,I hope that in the coming years,,more film and television programsncome out of Hollywood,,presenting us in a positive light.,Who knows? Maybe one day,nwe'll even have our own James Bond. Right?,"My name is Bond.,Jamal Bond." 
 (Laughter) 
 Til then, I'll keep telling jokes.nHope you keep laughing.,Have a good day. Thank you. 
 (Applause)Martin Luther King,did not say,,"I have a nightmare,",when he inspired the civil rights movements.,He said, "I have a dream.",And I have a dream.,I have a dream that we can stop thinking,that the future will be a nightmare,,and this is going to be a challenge,,because, if you think,of every major blockbusting film of recent times,,nearly all of its visions for humanity,are apocalyptic.,I think this film,is one of the hardest watches of modern times, "The Road.",It's a beautiful piece of filmmaking,,but everything is desolate,,everything is dead.,And just a father and son,trying to survive, walking along the road.,And I think the environmental movement,of which I am a part of,has been complicit,in creating this vision of the future. 
 For too long,,we have peddled a nightmarish vision,of what's going to happen.,We have focused on the worst-case scenario.,We have focused on the problems.,And we have not thought enough,about the solutions.,We've used fear, if you like,,to grab people's attention.,And any psychologist will tell you,that fear in the organism,is linked to flight mechanism.,It's part of the fight and flight mechanism,,that when an animal is frightened --,think of a deer.,A deer freezes very, very still,,poised to run away.,And I think that's what we're doing,when we're asking people to engage with our agenda,around environmental degradation and climate change.,People are freezing and running away,because we're using fear.,And I think the environmental movement has to grow up,and start to think about,what progress is. 
 What would it be like to be improving the human lot?,And one of the problems that we face, I think,,is that the only people that have cornered the market,in terms of progress,is a financial definition of what progress is,,an economic definition of what progress is --,that somehow,,if we get the right numbers to go up,,we're going to be better off,,whether that's on the stock market,,whether that's with GDP,and economic growth,,that somehow life is going to get better.,This is somehow appealing to human greed,instead of fear --,that more is better.,Come on. In the Western world, we have enough.,Maybe some parts of the world don't, but we have enough.,And we've know for a long time that this is not a good measure,of the welfare of nations.,In fact, the architect of our national accounting system,,Simon Kuznets, in the 1930s,,said that, "A nation's welfare,can scarcely be inferred from their national income.",But we've created a national accounting system,which is firmly based on production,and producing stuff.,And indeed, this is probably historical, and it had its time.,In the second World War, we needed to produce a lot of stuff.,And indeed, we were so successful at producing certain types of stuff,that we destroyed a lot of Europe, and we had to rebuild it afterwards.,And so our national accounting system,became fixated on what we can produce. 
 But as early as 1968,,this visionary man, Robert Kennedy,,at the start of his ill-fated presidential campaign,,gave the most eloquent deconstruction,of gross national product,that ever has been.,And he finished his talk with the phrase,,that, "The gross national product,measures everything except that,which makes life worthwhile.",How crazy is that? That our measure of progress,,our dominant measure of progress in society,,is measuring everything,except that which makes life worthwhile?,I believe, if Kennedy was alive today,,he would be asking statisticians such as myself,to go out and find out,what makes life worthwhile.,He'd be asking us to redesign,our national accounting system,to be based upon,such important things as social justice,,sustainability,and people's well-being. 
 And actually, social scientists have already gone out,and asked these questions around the world.,This is from a global survey.,It's asking people, what do they want.,And unsurprisingly, people all around the world,say that what they want,is happiness, for themselves,,for their families, their children,,their communities.,Okay, they think money is slightly important.,It's there, but it's not nearly as important as happiness,,and it's not nearly as important as love.,We all need to love and be loved in life.,It's not nearly as important as health.,We want to be healthy and live a full life.,These seem to be natural human aspirations.,Why are statisticians not measuring these?,Why are we not thinking of the progress of nations in these terms,,instead of just how much stuff we have?,And really, this is what I've done with my adult life --,is think about how do we measure happiness,,how do we measure well-being,,how can we do that within environmental limits. 
 And we created, at the organization that I work for,,the New Economics Foundation,,something we call the Happy Planet Index,,because we think people should be happy and the planet should be happy.,Why don't we create a measure of progress that shows that?,And what we do,,is we say that the ultimate outcome of a nation,is how successful is it,at creating happy and healthy lives for its citizens.,That should be the goal,of every nation on the planet.,But we have to remember,that there's a fundamental input to that,,and that is how many of the planet's resources we use.,We all have one planet. We all have to share it.,It is the ultimate scarce resource,,the one planet that we share.,And economics is very interested in scarcity.,When it has a scarce resource,that it wants to turn into,a desirable outcome,,it thinks in terms of efficiency.,It thinks in terms of how much bang do we get for our buck.,And this is a measure of how much well-being,we get for our planetary resource use.,It is an efficiency measure.,And probably the easiest way to show you that,,is to show you this graph. 
 Running horizontally along the graph,,is "ecological footprint,",which is a measure of how much resources we use,and how much pressure we put on the planet.,More is bad.,Running vertically upwards,,is a measure called "happy life years.",It's about the well-being of nations.,It's like a happiness adjusted life-expectancy.,It's like quality and quantity of life in nations.,And the yellow dot there you see, is the global average.,Now, there's a huge array of nations,around that global average.,To the top right of the graph,,are countries which are doing reasonably well and producing well-being,,but they're using a lot of planet to get there.,They are the U.S.A.,,other Western countries going across in those triangles,and a few Gulf states in there actually.,Conversely, at the bottom left of the graph,,are countries that are not producing much well-being --,typically, sub-Saharan Africa.,In Hobbesian terms,,life is short and brutish there.,The average life expectancy in many of these countries,is only 40 years.,Malaria, HIV/AIDS,are killing a lot of people,in these regions of the world. 
 But now for the good news!,There are some countries up there, yellow triangles,,that are doing better than global average,,that are heading up towards the top left of the graph.,This is an aspirational graph.,We want to be top left, where good lives don't cost the earth.,They're Latin American.,The country on its own up at the top,is a place I haven't been to.,Maybe some of you have.,Costa Rica.,Costa Rica --,average life expectancy is 78-and-a-half years.,That is longer than in the USA.,They are, according to the latest Gallup world poll,,the happiest nation on the planet --,than anybody; more than Switzerland and Denmark.,They are the happiest place.,They are doing that,on a quarter of the resources,that are used typically in [the] Western world --,a quarter of the resources. 
 What's going on there?,What's happening in Costa Rica?,We can look at some of the data.,99 percent of their electricity comes from renewable resources.,Their government is one of the first to commit,to be carbon neutral by 2021.,They abolished the army,in 1949 --,1949.,And they invested in social programs --,health and education.,They have one of the highest literacy rates in Latin America,and in the world.,And they have that Latin vibe, don't they.,They have the social connectedness.,(Laughter),The challenge is, that possibly -- and the thing we might have to think about --,is that the future,might not be North American,,might not be Western European.,It might be Latin American.,And the challenge, really,,is to pull the global average up here.,That's what we need to do.,And if we're going to do that,,we need to pull countries from the bottom,,and we need to pull countries from the right of the graph.,And then we're starting to create a happy planet.,That's one way of looking at it. 
 Another way of looking at it is looking at time trends.,We don't have good data going back for every country in the world,,but for some of the richest countries, the OECD group, we do.,And this is the trend in well-being over that time,,a small increase,,but this is the trend in ecological footprint.,And so in strict happy-planet methodology,,we've become less efficient,at turning our ultimate scarce resource,into the outcome we want to.,And the point really is, is that I think,,probably everybody in this room,would like society to get to 2050,without an apocalyptic,something happening.,It's actually not very long away.,It's half a human lifetime away.,A child entering school today,will be my age in 2050.,This is not the very distant future.,This is what the U.K. government target,on carbon and greenhouse emissions looks like.,And I put it to you, that is not business as usual.,That is changing our business.,That is changing the way we create our organizations,,we do our government policy and we live our lives.,And the point is,,we need to carry on increasing well-being.,No one can go to the polls,and say that quality of life is going to reduce.,None of us, I think,,want human progress to stop.,I think we want it to carry on.,I think we want the lot of humanity to keep on increasing.,And I think this is where climate change skeptics and deniers come in.,I think this is what they want. They want quality of life to keep increasing.,They want to hold on to what they've got.,And if we're going to engage them,,I think that's what we've got to do.,And that means we have to really increase efficiency even more. 
 Now that's all very easy to draw graphs and things like that,,but the point is we need to turn those curves.,And this is where I think we can take a leaf,out of systems theory, systems engineers,,where they create feedback loops,,put the right information at the right point of time.,Human beings are very motivated by the "now.",You put a smart meter in your home,,and you see how much electricity you're using right now,,how much it's costing you,,your kids go around and turn the lights off pretty quickly.,What would that look like for society?,Why is it, on the radio news every evening,,I hear the FTSE 100, the Dow Jones, the dollar pound ratio --,I don't even know which way the dollar pound ratio should go to be good news.,And why do I hear that?,Why don't I hear how much energy Britain used yesterday,,or American used yesterday?,Did we meet our three percent annual target,on reducing carbon emissions?,That's how you create a collective goal.,You put it out there into the media and start thinking about it.,And we need positive feedback loops,for increasing well-being,At a government level, they might create national accounts of well-being.,At a business level, you might look at the well-being of your employees,,which we know is really linked to creativity,,which is linked to innovation,,and we're going to need a lot of innovation to deal with those environmental issues.,At a personal level, we need these nudges too.,Maybe we don't quite need the data, but we need reminders.,In the U.K., we have a strong public health message,on five fruit and vegetables a day,and how much exercise we should do -- never my best thing.,What are these for happiness?,What are the five things that you should do every day,to be happier? 
 We did a project for the Government Office of Science a couple of years ago,,a big program called the Foresight program --,lots and lots of people -- involved lots of experts --,everything evidence based -- a huge tome.,But a piece of work we did was on: what five positive actions can you do,to improve well-being in your life?,And the point of these is,they are, not quite, the secrets of happiness,,but they are things that I think happiness will flow out the side from. 
 And the first of these is to connect,,is that your social relationships,are the most important cornerstones of your life.,Do you invest the time with your loved ones,that you could do, and energy?,Keep building them.,The second one is be active.,The fastest way out of a bad mood:,step outside, go for a walk, turn the radio on and dance.,Being active is great for our positive mood.,The third one is take notice.,How aware are you of things going on around the world,,the seasons changing, people around you?,Do you notice what's bubbling up for you and trying to emerge?,Based on a lot of evidence for mindfulness,,cognitive behavioral therapy,,[very] strong for our well being.,The fourth is keep learning,and keep is important --,learning throughout the whole life course.,Older people who keep learning and are curious,,they have much better health outcomes than those who start to close down.,But it doesn't have to be formal learning; it's not knowledge based.,It's more curiosity.,It can be learning to cook a new dish,,picking up an instrument you forgot as a child.,Keep learning.,And the final one,is that most anti-economic of activities,,but give.,Our generosity, our altruism,,our compassion,,are all hardwired,to the reward mechanism in our brain.,We feel good if we give.,You can do an experiment where you give,two groups of people a hundred dollars in the morning.,You tell one of them to spend it on themselves,and one on other people.,You measure their happiness at the end of the day,,those that have gone and spent on other people are much happier,that those that spent it on themselves. 
 And these five ways,,which we put onto these handy postcards,,I would say, don't have to cost the earth.,They don't have any carbon content.,They don't need a lot of material goods to be satisfied.,And so I think it's really quite feasible,that happiness does not cost the earth.,Now, Martin Luther King,,on the eve of his death,,gave an incredible speech.,He said, "I know there are challenges ahead,,there may be trouble ahead,,but I fear no one. I don't care.,I have been to the mountain top,,and I have seen the Promised Land.",Now, he was a preacher,,but I believe the environmental movement,and, in fact, the business community, government,,needs to go to the top of the mountain top,,and it needs to look out,,and it needs to see the Promised Land,,or the land of promise,,and it needs to have a vision,of a world that we all want.,And not only that, we need to create a Great Transition,to get there,,and we need to pave that great transition with good things. 
 Human beings want to be happy.,Pave them with the five ways.,And we need to have signposts,gathering people together and pointing them --,something like the Happy Planet Index.,And then I believe,that we can all create a world we all want,,where happiness does not cost the earth. 
 (Applause)We live in in a remarkable time,,the age of genomics.,Your genome is the entire sequence of your DNA.,Your sequence and mine are slightly different.,That's why we look different.,I've got brown eyes;,you might have blue or gray.,But it's not just skin-deep.,The headlines tell us,that genes can give us scary diseases,,maybe even shape our personality,,or give us mental disorders.,Our genes seem to have,awesome power over our destinies.,And yet, I would like to think,that I am more than my genes.,What do you guys think?,Are you more than your genes?,(Audience: Yes.) Yes?,I think some people agree with me.,I think we should make a statement.,I think we should say it all together.,All right: "I'm more than my genes" -- all together.,Everybody: I am more than my genes.,(Cheering),Sebastian Seung: What am I?,(Laughter),I am my connectome.,Now, since you guys are really great,,maybe you can humor me and say this all together too.,(Laughter),Right. All together now.,Everybody: I am my connectome.,SS: That sounded great.,You know, you guys are so great, you don't even know what a connectome is,,and you're willing to play along with me.,I could just go home now. 
 Well, so far only one connectome is known,,that of this tiny worm.,Its modest nervous system,consists of just 300 neurons.,And in the 1970s and '80s,,a team of scientists,mapped all 7,000 connections,between the neurons.,In this diagram, every node is a neuron,,and every line is a connection.,This is the connectome,of the worm C. elegans.,Your connectome is far more complex than this,because your brain,contains 100 billion neurons,and 10,000 times as many connections.,There's a diagram like this for your brain,,but there's no way it would fit on this slide.,Your connectome contains one million times more connections,than your genome has letters.,That's a lot of information. 
 What's in that information?,We don't know for sure, but there are theories.,Since the 19th century, neuroscientists have speculated,that maybe your memories --,the information that makes you, you --,maybe your memories are stored,in the connections between your brain's neurons.,And perhaps other aspects of your personal identity --,maybe your personality and your intellect --,maybe they're also encoded,in the connections between your neurons.,And so now you can see why I proposed this hypothesis:,I am my connectome.,I didn't ask you to chant it because it's true;,I just want you to remember it.,And in fact, we don't know if this hypothesis is correct,,because we have never had technologies,powerful enough to test it.,Finding that worm connectome,took over a dozen years of tedious labor.,And to find the connectomes of brains more like our own,,we need more sophisticated technologies, that are automated,,that will speed up the process of finding connectomes.,And in the next few minutes, I'll tell you about some of these technologies,,which are currently under development,in my lab and the labs of my collaborators. 
 Now you've probably seen pictures of neurons before.,You can recognize them instantly,by their fantastic shapes.,They extend long and delicate branches,,and in short, they look like trees.,But this is just a single neuron.,In order to find connectomes,,we have to see all the neurons at the same time.,So let's meet Bobby Kasthuri,,who works in the laboratory of Jeff Lichtman,at Harvard University.,Bobby is holding fantastically thin slices,of a mouse brain.,And we're zooming in by a factor of 100,000 times,to obtain the resolution,,so that we can see the branches of neurons all at the same time.,Except, you still may not really recognize them,,and that's because we have to work in three dimensions. 
 If we take many images of many slices of the brain,and stack them up,,we get a three-dimensional image.,And still, you may not see the branches.,So we start at the top,,and we color in the cross-section of one branch in red,,and we do that for the next slice,and for the next slice.,And we keep on doing that,,slice after slice.,If we continue through the entire stack,,we can reconstruct the three-dimensional shape,of a small fragment of a branch of a neuron.,And we can do that for another neuron in green.,And you can see that the green neuron touches the red neuron,at two locations,,and these are what are called synapses. 
 Let's zoom in on one synapse,,and keep your eyes on the interior of the green neuron.,You should see small circles --,these are called vesicles.,They contain a molecule know as a neurotransmitter.,And so when the green neuron wants to communicate,,it wants to send a message to the red neuron,,it spits out neurotransmitter.,At the synapse, the two neurons,are said to be connected,like two friends talking on the telephone. 
 So you see how to find a synapse.,How can we find an entire connectome?,Well, we take this three-dimensional stack of images,and treat it as a gigantic three-dimensional coloring book.,We color every neuron in, in a different color,,and then we look through all of the images,,find the synapses,and note the colors of the two neurons involved in each synapse.,If we can do that throughout all the images,,we could find a connectome. 
 Now, at this point,,you've learned the basics of neurons and synapses.,And so I think we're ready to tackle,one of the most important questions in neuroscience:,how are the brains of men and women different?,(Laughter),According to this self-help book,,guys brains are like waffles;,they keep their lives compartmentalized in boxes.,Girls' brains are like spaghetti;,everything in their life is connected to everything else.,(Laughter),You guys are laughing,,but you know, this book changed my life.,(Laughter),But seriously, what's wrong with this?,You already know enough to tell me -- what's wrong with this statement?,It doesn't matter whether you're a guy or girl,,everyone's brains are like spaghetti.,Or maybe really, really fine capellini with branches.,Just as one strand of spaghetti,contacts many other strands on your plate,,one neuron touches many other neurons,through their entangled branches.,One neuron can be connected to so many other neurons,,because there can be synapses,at these points of contact.,By now, you might have sort of lost perspective,on how large this cube of brain tissue actually is. 
 And so let's do a series of comparisons to show you.,I assure you, this is very tiny. It's just six microns on a side.,So, here's how it stacks up against an entire neuron.,And you can tell that, really, only the smallest fragments of branches,are contained inside this cube.,And a neuron, well, that's smaller than brain.,And that's just a mouse brain --,it's a lot smaller than a human brain.,So when show my friends this,,sometimes they've told me,,"You know, Sebastian, you should just give up.,Neuroscience is hopeless.",Because if you look at a brain with your naked eye,,you don't really see how complex it is,,but when you use a microscope,,finally the hidden complexity is revealed. 
 In the 17th century,,the mathematician and philosopher, Blaise Pascal,,wrote of his dread of the infinite,,his feeling of insignificance,at contemplating the vast reaches of outer space.,And, as a scientist,,I'm not supposed to talk about my feelings --,too much information, professor.,(Laughter),But may I?,(Laughter),(Applause),I feel curiosity,,and I feel wonder,,but at times I have also felt despair.,Why did I choose to study,this organ that is so awesome in its complexity,that it might well be infinite?,It's absurd.,How could we even dare to think,that we might ever understand this? 
 And yet, I persist in this quixotic endeavor.,And indeed, these days I harbor new hopes.,Someday,,a fleet of microscopes will capture,every neuron and every synapse,in a vast database of images.,And some day, artificially intelligent supercomputers,will analyze the images without human assistance,to summarize them in a connectome.,I do not know, but I hope that I will live to see that day,,because finding an entire human connectome,is one of the greatest technological challenges of all time.,It will take the work of generations to succeed.,At the present time, my collaborators and I,,what we're aiming for is much more modest --,just to find partial connectomes,of tiny chunks of mouse and human brain.,But even that will be enough for the first tests of this hypothesis,that I am my connectome.,For now, let me try to convince you of the plausibility of this hypothesis,,that it's actually worth taking seriously. 
 As you grow during childhood,and age during adulthood,,your personal identity changes slowly.,Likewise, every connectome,changes over time.,What kinds of changes happen?,Well, neurons, like trees,,can grow new branches,,and they can lose old ones.,Synapses can be created,,and they can be eliminated.,And synapses can grow larger,,and they can grow smaller.,Second question:,what causes these changes?,Well, it's true.,To some extent, they are programmed by your genes.,But that's not the whole story,,because there are signals, electrical signals,,that travel along the branches of neurons,and chemical signals,that jump across from branch to branch.,These signals are called neural activity.,And there's a lot of evidence,that neural activity,is encoding our thoughts, feelings and perceptions,,our mental experiences.,And there's a lot of evidence that neural activity,can cause your connections to change.,And if you put those two facts together,,it means that your experiences,can change your connectome.,And that's why every connectome is unique,,even those of genetically identical twins.,The connectome is where nature meets nurture.,And it might true,that just the mere act of thinking,can change your connectome --,an idea that you may find empowering. 
 What's in this picture?,A cool and refreshing stream of water, you say.,What else is in this picture?,Do not forget that groove in the Earth,called the stream bed.,Without it, the water would not know in which direction to flow.,And with the stream,,I would like to propose a metaphor,for the relationship between neural activity,and connectivity.,Neural activity is constantly changing.,It's like the water of the stream; it never sits still.,The connections,of the brain's neural network,determines the pathways,along which neural activity flows.,And so the connectome is like bed of the stream;,but the metaphor is richer than that,,because it's true that the stream bed,guides the flow of the water,,but over long timescales,,the water also reshapes the bed of the stream.,And as I told you just now,,neural activity can change the connectome.,And if you'll allow me to ascend,to metaphorical heights,,I will remind you that neural activity,is the physical basis -- or so neuroscientists think --,of thoughts, feelings and perceptions.,And so we might even speak of,the stream of consciousness.,Neural activity is its water,,and the connectome is its bed. 
 So let's return from the heights of metaphor,and return to science.,Suppose our technologies for finding connectomes,actually work.,How will we go about testing the hypothesis,"I am my connectome?",Well, I propose a direct test.,Let us attempt,to read out memories from connectomes.,Consider the memory,of long temporal sequences of movements,,like a pianist playing a Beethoven sonata.,According to a theory that dates back to the 19th century,,such memories are stored,as chains of synaptic connections inside your brain.,Because, if the first neurons in the chain are activated,,through their synapses they send messages to the second neurons, which are activated,,and so on down the line,,like a chain of falling dominoes.,And this sequence of neural activation,is hypothesized to be the neural basis,of those sequence of movements. 
 So one way of trying to test the theory,is to look for such chains,inside connectomes.,But it won't be easy, because they're not going to look like this.,They're going to be scrambled up.,So we'll have to use our computers,to try to unscramble the chain.,And if we can do that,,the sequence of the neurons we recover from that unscrambling,will be a prediction of the pattern of neural activity,that is replayed in the brain during memory recall.,And if that were successful,,that would be the first example of reading a memory from a connectome. 
 (Laughter) 
 What a mess --,have you ever tried to wire up a system,as complex as this?,I hope not.,But if you have, you know it's very easy to make a mistake.,The branches of neurons are like the wires of the brain.,Can anyone guess: what's the total length of wires in your brain?,I'll give you a hint. It's a big number.,(Laughter),I estimate, millions of miles,,all packed in your skull.,And if you appreciate that number,,you can easily see,there is huge potential for mis-wiring of the brain.,And indeed, the popular press loves headlines like,,"Anorexic brains are wired differently,",or "Autistic brains are wired differently.",These are plausible claims,,but in truth,,we can't see the brain's wiring clearly enough,to tell if these are really true.,And so the technologies for seeing connectomes,will allow us to finally,read mis-wiring of the brain,,to see mental disorders in connectomes. 
 Sometimes the best way to test a hypothesis,is to consider its most extreme implication.,Philosophers know this game very well.,If you believe that I am my connectome,,I think you must also accept the idea,that death is the destruction,of your connectome.,I mention this because there are prophets today,who claim that technology,will fundamentally alter the human condition,and perhaps even transform the human species.,One of their most cherished dreams,is to cheat death,by that practice known as cryonics.,If you pay 100,000 dollars,,you can arrange to have your body frozen after death,and stored in liquid nitrogen,in one of these tanks in an Arizona warehouse,,awaiting a future civilization,that is advanced to resurrect you. 
 Should we ridicule the modern seekers of immortality,,calling them fools?,Or will they someday chuckle,over our graves?,I don't know --,I prefer to test their beliefs, scientifically.,I propose that we attempt to find a connectome,of a frozen brain.,We know that damage to the brain,occurs after death and during freezing.,The question is: has that damage erased the connectome?,If it has, there is no way that any future civilization,will be able to recover the memories of these frozen brains.,Resurrection might succeed for the body,,but not for the mind.,On the other hand, if the connectome is still intact,,we cannot ridicule the claims of cryonics so easily. 
 I've described a quest,that begins in the world of the very small,,and propels us to the world of the far future.,Connectomes will mark a turning point in human history.,As we evolved from our ape-like ancestors,on the African savanna,,what distinguished us was our larger brains.,We have used our brains to fashion,ever more amazing technologies.,Eventually, these technologies will become so powerful,that we will use them to know ourselves,by deconstructing and reconstructing,our own brains.,I believe that this voyage of self-discovery,is not just for scientists,,but for all of us.,And I'm grateful for the opportunity to share this voyage with you today. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Up until now, our communication with machines,has always been limited,to conscious and direct forms.,Whether it's something simple,like turning on the lights with a switch,,or even as complex as programming robotics,,we have always had to give a command to a machine,,or even a series of commands,,in order for it to do something for us.,Communication between people, on the other hand,,is far more complex and a lot more interesting,because we take into account,so much more than what is explicitly expressed.,We observe facial expressions, body language,,and we can intuit feelings and emotions,from our dialogue with one another.,This actually forms a large part,of our decision-making process.,Our vision is to introduce,this whole new realm of human interaction,into human-computer interaction,so that computers can understand,not only what you direct it to do,,but it can also respond,to your facial expressions,and emotional experiences.,And what better way to do this,than by interpreting the signals,naturally produced by our brain,,our center for control and experience. 
 Well, it sounds like a pretty good idea,,but this task, as Bruno mentioned,,isn't an easy one for two main reasons:,First, the detection algorithms.,Our brain is made up of,billions of active neurons,,around 170,000 km,of combined axon length.,When these neurons interact,,the chemical reaction emits an electrical impulse,,which can be measured.,The majority of our functional brain,is distributed over,the outer surface layer of the brain,,and to increase the area that's available for mental capacity,,the brain surface is highly folded.,Now this cortical folding,presents a significant challenge,for interpreting surface electrical impulses.,Each individual's cortex,is folded differently,,very much like a fingerprint.,So even though a signal,may come from the same functional part of the brain,,by the time the structure has been folded,,its physical location,is very different between individuals,,even identical twins.,There is no longer any consistency,in the surface signals. 
 Our breakthrough was to create an algorithm,that unfolds the cortex,,so that we can map the signals,closer to its source,,and therefore making it capable of working across a mass population.,The second challenge,is the actual device for observing brainwaves.,EEG measurements typically involve,a hairnet with an array of sensors,,like the one that you can see here in the photo.,A technician will put the electrodes,onto the scalp,using a conductive gel or paste,and usually after a procedure of preparing the scalp,by light abrasion.,Now this is quite time consuming,and isn't the most comfortable process.,And on top of that, these systems,actually cost in the tens of thousands of dollars. 
 So with that, I'd like to invite onstage,Evan Grant, who is one of last year's speakers,,who's kindly agreed,to help me to demonstrate,what we've been able to develop. 
 (Applause) 
 So the device that you see,is a 14-channel, high-fidelity,EEG acquisition system.,It doesn't require any scalp preparation,,no conductive gel or paste.,It only takes a few minutes to put on,and for the signals to settle.,It's also wireless,,so it gives you the freedom to move around.,And compared to the tens of thousands of dollars,for a traditional EEG system,,this headset only costs,a few hundred dollars.,Now on to the detection algorithms.,So facial expressions --,as I mentioned before in emotional experiences --,are actually designed to work out of the box,with some sensitivity adjustments,available for personalization.,But with the limited time we have available,,I'd like to show you the cognitive suite,,which is the ability for you,to basically move virtual objects with your mind. 
 Now, Evan is new to this system,,so what we have to do first,is create a new profile for him.,He's obviously not Joanne -- so we'll "add user.",Evan. Okay.,So the first thing we need to do with the cognitive suite,is to start with training,a neutral signal.,With neutral, there's nothing in particular,that Evan needs to do.,He just hangs out. He's relaxed.,And the idea is to establish a baseline,or normal state for his brain,,because every brain is different.,It takes eight seconds to do this,,and now that that's done,,we can choose a movement-based action.,So Evan, choose something,that you can visualize clearly in your mind. 
 Evan Grant: Let's do "pull." 
 Tan Le: Okay, so let's choose "pull.",So the idea here now,is that Evan needs to,imagine the object coming forward,into the screen,,and there's a progress bar that will scroll across the screen,while he's doing that.,The first time, nothing will happen,,because the system has no idea how he thinks about "pull.",But maintain that thought,for the entire duration of the eight seconds.,So: one, two, three, go.,Okay.,So once we accept this,,the cube is live.,So let's see if Evan,can actually try and imagine pulling.,Ah, good job!,(Applause),That's really amazing. 
 (Applause) 
 So we have a little bit of time available,,so I'm going to ask Evan,to do a really difficult task.,And this one is difficult,because it's all about being able to visualize something,that doesn't exist in our physical world.,This is "disappear.",So what you want to do -- at least with movement-based actions,,we do that all the time, so you can visualize it.,But with "disappear," there's really no analogies --,so Evan, what you want to do here,is to imagine the cube slowly fading out, okay.,Same sort of drill. So: one, two, three, go.,Okay. Let's try that.,Oh, my goodness. He's just too good.,Let's try that again. 
 EG: Losing concentration. 
 (Laughter) 
 TL: But we can see that it actually works,,even though you can only hold it,for a little bit of time.,As I said, it's a very difficult process,to imagine this.,And the great thing about it is that,we've only given the software one instance,of how he thinks about "disappear.",As there is a machine learning algorithm in this -- 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you.,Good job. Good job. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you, Evan, you're a wonderful, wonderful,example of the technology. 
 So, as you can see, before,,there is a leveling system built into this software,so that as Evan, or any user,,becomes more familiar with the system,,they can continue to add more and more detections,,so that the system begins to differentiate,between different distinct thoughts.,And once you've trained up the detections,,these thoughts can be assigned or mapped,to any computing platform,,application or device. 
 So I'd like to show you a few examples,,because there are many possible applications,for this new interface.,In games and virtual worlds, for example,,your facial expressions,can naturally and intuitively be used,to control an avatar or virtual character.,Obviously, you can experience the fantasy of magic,and control the world with your mind.,And also, colors, lighting,,sound and effects,can dynamically respond to your emotional state,to heighten the experience that you're having, in real time.,And moving on to some applications,developed by developers and researchers around the world,,with robots and simple machines, for example --,in this case, flying a toy helicopter,simply by thinking "lift" with your mind. 
 The technology can also be applied,to real world applications --,in this example, a smart home.,You know, from the user interface of the control system,to opening curtains,or closing curtains.,And of course, also to the lighting --,turning them on,or off.,And finally,,to real life-changing applications,,such as being able to control an electric wheelchair.,In this example,,facial expressions are mapped to the movement commands. 
 Man: Now blink right to go right.,Now blink left to turn back left.,Now smile to go straight. 
 TL: We really -- Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 We are really only scratching the surface of what is possible today,,and with the community's input,,and also with the involvement of developers,and researchers from around the world,,we hope that you can help us to shape,where the technology goes from here. Thank you so much.I woke up in the middle of the night,with the sound of heavy explosion.,It was deep at night.,I do not remember what time it was.,I just remember the sound,was so heavy,and so very shocking.,Everything in my room was shaking --,my heart, my windows,,my bed, everything.,I looked out the windows,and I saw a full half-circle,of explosion.,I thought it was just like the movies,,but the movies had not conveyed them,in the powerful image that I was seeing,full of bright red,and orange and gray,,and a full circle of explosion.,And I kept on staring at it,until it disappeared.,I went back to my bed,,and I prayed,,and I secretly thanked God,that that missile,did not land on my family's home,,that it did not kill my family that night.,Thirty years have passed,,and I still feel guilty about that prayer,,for the next day, I learned that that missile,landed on my brother's friend's home,and killed him,and his father,,but did not kill his mother or his sister.,His mother showed up the next week,at my brother's classroom,and begged seven-year-old kids,to share with her any picture they may have,of her son,,for she had lost everything. 
 This is not a story,of a nameless survivor of war,,and nameless refugees,,whose stereotypical images we see in our newspapers,and our TV,with tattered clothes,,dirty face, scared eyes.,This is not a story of a nameless someone,who lived in some war,,who we do not know their hopes, their dreams,,their accomplishments, their families,,their beliefs, their values.,This is my story.,I was that girl.,I am another image and vision,of another survivor of war.,I am that refugee,,and I am that girl.,You see,,I grew up in war-torn Iraq,,and I believe that there are two sides of wars,and we've only seen,one side of it.,We only talk about,one side of it.,But there's another side,that I have witnessed,as someone who lived in it,and someone who ended up working in it. 
 I grew up with the colors of war --,the red colors of fire and blood,,the brown tones of earth,as it explodes,in our faces,and the piercing silver,of an exploded missile,,so bright,that nothing can protect your eyes from it.,I grew up,with the sounds of war --,the staccato sounds of gunfire,,the wrenching booms of explosions,,ominous drones of jets flying overhead,and the wailing warning sounds,of sirens.,These are the sounds you would expect,,but they are also the sounds,of dissonant concerts of a flock of birds,screeching in the night,,the high-pitched honest cries,of children,and the thunderous,,unbearable,silence.,"War," a friend of mine said,,"is not about sound at all.,It is actually about silence,,the silence of humanity." 
 I have since left Iraq,and founded a group called Women for Women International,that ends up working,with women survivors of wars.,In my travels and in my work,,from Congo to Afghanistan,,from Sudan to Rwanda,,I have learned not only,that the colors and the sounds of war are the same,,but the fears of war are the same.,You know, there is a fear of dying,,and do not believe any movie character,where the hero is not afraid.,It is very scary,to go through that feeling,of "I am about to die",or "I could die in this explosion.",But there's also the fear,of losing loved ones,,and I think that's even worse.,It's too painful. You don't want to think about it.,But I think the worst kind of fear is the fear --,as Samia, a Bosnian woman, once told me,,who survived the four-years besiege of Sarajevo;,she said, "The fear,of losing,the 'I' in me,,the fear of losing,the 'I' in me.",That's what my mother in Iraq,used to tell me.,It's like dying from inside-out.,A Palestinian woman once told me,,"It is not about the fear of one death,",she said, "sometimes I feel,I die 10 times in one day,",as she was describing the marches of soldiers,and the sounds of their bullets.,She said, "But it's not fair,,because there is only one life,,and there should only be one death." 
 We have been only seeing,one side of war.,We have only been discussing and consumed,with high-level preoccupations,over troop levels, drawdown timelines,,surges and sting operations,,when we should be examining the details,of where the social fabric,has been most torn,,where the community has improvised,and survived,and shown acts of resilience,and amazing courage,just to keep life going.,We have been so consumed,with seemingly objective discussions,of politics, tactics,,weapons, dollars,and casualties.,This is the language,of sterility. 
 How casually,we treat casualties,in the context of this topic.,This is where we conceive of rape and casualties,as inevitabilities.,Eighty percent of refugees around the world,are women and children. Oh.,Ninety percent of modern war casualties,are civilians.,Seventy-five percent of them are women and children.,How interesting.,Oh, half a million women in Rwanda,get raped in 100 days.,Or, as we speak now,,hundreds of thousands of Congolese women,are getting raped and mutilated.,How interesting.,These just become numbers that we refer to.,The front of wars,is increasingly non-human eyes,peering down on our perceived enemies,from space,,guiding missiles toward unseen targets,,while the human conduct,of the orchestra of media relations,in the event that this particular drone attack,hits a villager,instead of an extremist.,It is a chess game.,You learn to play an international relations school,on your way out and up,to national and international leadership.,Checkmate. 
 We are missing,a completely other side of wars.,We are missing my mother's story,,who made sure with every siren, with every raid,,with every cut off-of electricity,,she played puppet shows for my brothers and I,,so we would not be scared,of the sounds of explosions.,We are missing the story of Fareeda,,a music teacher,,a piano teacher, in Sarajevo,,who made sure,that she kept the music school open,every single day,in the four years of besiege in Sarajevo,and walked to that school,,despite the snipers shooting,at that school and at her,,and kept the piano, the violin, the cello,playing the whole duration of the war,,with students wearing their gloves and hats and coats.,That was her fight.,That was her resistance.,We are missing the story of Nehia,,a Palestinian woman in Gaza,who, the minute there was a cease-fire in the last year's war,,she left out of home,,collected all the flour,and baked as much bread for every neighbor to have,,in case there is no cease-fire the day after.,We are missing,the stories of Violet,,who, despite surviving genocide in the church massacre,,she kept on going on,,burying bodies, cleaning homes, cleaning the streets.,We are missing stories of women,who are literally keeping life going,in the midst of wars.,Do you know --,do you know that people fall in love in war,and go to school,and go to factories and hospitals,and get divorced and go dancing and go playing,and live life going?,And the ones who are keeping that life,are women. 
 There are two sides of war.,There is a side that fights,,and there is a side that keeps the schools,and the factories and the hospitals open.,There is a side that is focused on winning battles,,and there is a side that is focused,on winning life.,There is a side that leads the front-line discussion,,and there is a side,that leads the back-line discussion.,There is a side that thinks,that peace is the end of fighting,,and there is a side that thinks,that peace is the arrival,of schools and jobs.,There is a side,that is led by men,,and there is a side,that is led by women.,And in order for us to understand,how do we build lasting peace,,we must understand war and peace,from both sides.,We must have a full picture,of what that means. 
 In order for us to understand,what actually peace means,,we need to understand,,as one Sudanese woman once told me,,"Peace is the fact that my toenails,are growing back again.",She grew up in Sudan, in Southern Sudan,,for 20 years of war,,where it killed one million people,and displaced five million refugees.,Many women were taken as slaves,by rebels and soldiers,,as sexual slaves who were forced also,to carry the ammunition and the water,and the food for the soldiers.,So that woman walked for 20 years,,so she would not be kidnapped again.,And only when there was some sort of peace,,her toenails grew back again.,We need to understand peace,from a toenail's perspective. 
 We need to understand,that we cannot actually have negotiations,of ending of wars or peace,without fully including women,at the negotiating table.,I find it amazing,that the only group of people,who are not fighting and not killing,and not pillaging and not burning and not raping,,and the group of people who are mostly --,though not exclusively --,who are keeping life going in the midst of war,,are not included in the negotiating table.,And I do argue that women lead the back-line discussion,,but there are also men,who are excluded from that discussion.,The doctors who are not fighting,,the artists, the students, the men who refuse to pick up the guns,,they are, too, excluded,from the negotiating tables.,There is no way we can talk about a lasting peace,,building of democracy, sustainable economies,,any kind of stabilities,,if we do not fully include women,at the negotiating table.,Not one, but 50 percent. 
 There is no way we can talk about the building of stability,if we don't start investing,in women and girls.,Did you know,that one year,of the world's military spending,equals 700 years,of the U.N. budget,and equals 2,928 years,of the U.N. budget allocated for women?,If we just reverse,that distribution of funds,,perhaps we could have,a better lasting peace in this world.,And last, but not least,,we need to invest in peace and women,,not only because it is the right thing to do,,not only because it is the right thing to do,,for all of us to build sustainable and lasting peace today,,but it is for the future. 
 A Congolese woman,,who was telling me about,how her children saw their father killed in front of them,and saw her raped in front of them,and mutilated in front of them,,and her children saw their nine-year-old sibling,killed in front of them,,how they're doing okay right now.,She got into Women for Women International's program.,She got a support network.,She learned about her rights.,We taught her vocational and business skills. We helped her get a job.,She was earning 450 dollars. She was doing okay.,She was sending them to school. Have a new home.,She said, "But what I worry about the most,is not any of that.,I worry that my children,have hate in their hearts,,and when they want to grow up, they want to fight again,the killers of their father and their brother.",We need to invest in women,,because that's our only chance,to ensure that there is no more war,in the future.,That mother has a better chance to heal her children,than any peace agreement can do. 
 Are there good news? Of course, there are good news. There are lots of good news.,To start with, these women that I told you about,are dancing and singing every single day,,and if they can,,who are we not to dance?,That girl that I told you about,ended up starting Women for Women International Group,that impacted one million people, sent 80 million dollars,,and I started this from zero,,nothing, nada, [unclear]. 
 (Laughter) 
 They are women who are standing on their feet,in spite of their circumstances,,not because of it.,Think of how the world can be a much better place,if, for a change,,we have a better equality,,we have equality,,we have a representation,and we understand war,,both from the front-line,and the back-line discussion. 
 Rumi, a 13th-century Sufi poet,,says, "Out beyond the worlds,of right-doings and wrong-doings,,there is a field.,I will meet you there.,When the soul lies down in that grass,,the world is too full,to talk about.,Ideas, language,,even the phrase 'each other',no longer makes any sense.",I humbly add -- humbly add --,that out beyond,the worlds of war and peace,,there is a field,,and there are many women and men,[who] are meeting there.,Let us make this field a much bigger place.,Let us all meet in that field. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)The theme of my talk today is,,"Be an artist, right now.",Most people, when this subject is brought up,,get tense and resist it:,"Art doesn't feed me, and right now I'm busy.,I have to go to school, get a job,,send my kids to lessons ... ",You think, "I'm too busy. I don't have time for art.",There are hundreds of reasons why we can't be artists right now.,Don't they just pop into your head? 
 There are so many reasons why we can't be,,indeed, we're not sure why we should be.,We don't know why we should be artists,,but we have many reasons why we can't be.,Why do people instantly resist the idea of associating themselves with art?,Perhaps you think art is for the greatly gifted,or for the thoroughly and professionally trained.,And some of you may think you've strayed too far from art.,Well you might have, but I don't think so.,This is the theme of my talk today.,We are all born artists. 
 If you have kids, you know what I mean.,Almost everything kids do is art.,They draw with crayons on the wall.,They dance to Son Dam Bi's dance on TV,,but you can't even call it Son Dam Bi's dance -- it becomes the kids' own dance.,So they dance a strange dance and inflict their singing on everyone.,Perhaps their art is something only their parents can bear,,and because they practice such art all day long,,people honestly get a little tired around kids. 
 Kids will sometimes perform monodramas --,playing house is indeed a monodrama or a play.,And some kids, when they get a bit older,,start to lie.,Usually parents remember the very first time their kid lies.,They're shocked.,"Now you're showing your true colors," Mom says. She thinks, "Why does he take after his dad?",She questions him, "What kind of a person are you going to be?" 
 But you shouldn't worry.,The moment kids start to lie is the moment storytelling begins.,They are talking about things they didn't see.,It's amazing. It's a wonderful moment.,Parents should celebrate.,"Hurray! My boy finally started to lie!",All right! It calls for celebration.,For example, a kid says, "Mom, guess what? I met an alien on my way home.",Then a typical mom responds, "Stop that nonsense.",Now, an ideal parent is someone who responds like this:,"Really? An alien, huh? What did it look like? Did it say anything?,Where did you meet it?" "Um, in front of the supermarket." 
 When you have a conversation like this,,the kid has to come up with the next thing to say to be responsible for what he started.,Soon, a story develops.,Of course this is an infantile story,,but thinking up one sentence after the next,is the same thing a professional writer like me does.,In essence, they are not different.,Roland Barthes once said of Flaubert's novels,,"Flaubert did not write a novel.,He merely connected one sentence after another.,The eros between sentences, that is the essence of Flaubert's novel.",That's right -- a novel, basically, is writing one sentence,,then, without violating the scope of the first one,,writing the next sentence.,And you continue to make connections. 
 Take a look at this sentence:,"One morning, as Gregor Samsa was waking up from anxious dreams, he discovered that in his bed he had been changed into a monstrous verminous bug.",Yes, it's the first sentence of Franz Kafka's "The Metamorphosis.",Writing such an unjustifiable sentence,and continuing in order to justify it,,Kafka's work became the masterpiece of contemporary literature.,Kafka did not show his work to his father.,He was not on good terms with his father.,On his own, he wrote these sentences.,Had he shown his father, "My boy has finally lost it," he would've thought. 
 And that's right. Art is about going a little nuts,and justifying the next sentence,,which is not much different from what a kid does.,A kid who has just started to lie,is taking the first step as a storyteller.,Kids do art.,They don't get tired and they have fun doing it.,I was in Jeju Island a few days ago.,When kids are on the beach, most of them love playing in the water.,But some of them spend a lot of time in the sand,,making mountains and seas -- well, not seas,,but different things -- people and dogs, etc.,But parents tell them,,"It will all be washed away by the waves.",In other words, it's useless.,There's no need.,But kids don't mind.,They have fun in the moment,and they keep playing in the sand.,Kids don't do it because someone told them to.,They aren't told by their boss,or anyone, they just do it. 
 When you were little, I bet you spent time enjoying the pleasure of primitive art.,When I ask my students to write about their happiest moment,,many write about an early artistic experience they had as a kid.,Learning to play piano for the first time and playing four hands with a friend,,or performing a ridiculous skit with friends looking like idiots -- things like that.,Or the moment you developed the first film you shot with an old camera.,They talk about these kinds of experiences.,You must have had such a moment.,In that moment, art makes you happy,because it's not work.,Work doesn't make you happy, does it? Mostly it's tough. 
 The French writer Michel Tournier has a famous saying.,It's a bit mischievous, actually.,"Work is against human nature. The proof is that it makes us tired.",Right? Why would work tire us if it's in our nature?,Playing doesn't tire us.,We can play all night long.,If we work overnight, we should be paid for overtime.,Why? Because it's tiring and we feel fatigue.,But kids, usually they do art for fun. It's playing.,They don't draw to sell the work to a client,or play the piano to earn money for the family.,Of course, there were kids who had to.,You know this gentleman, right?,He had to tour around Europe to support his family --,Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart --,but that was centuries ago, so we can make him an exception.,Unfortunately, at some point our art -- such a joyful pastime -- ends.,Kids have to go to lessons, to school, do homework,and of course they take piano or ballet lessons,,but they aren't fun anymore.,You're told to do it and there's competition. How can it be fun?,If you're in elementary school and you still draw on the wall,,you'll surely get in trouble with your mom.,Besides,,if you continue to act like an artist as you get older,,you'll increasingly feel pressure --,people will question your actions and ask you to act properly. 
 Here's my story: I was an eighth grader and I entered a drawing contest at school in Gyeongbokgung.,I was trying my best, and my teacher came around,and asked me, "What are you doing?","I'm drawing diligently," I said.,"Why are you using only black?",Indeed, I was eagerly coloring the sketchbook in black.,And I explained,,"It's a dark night and a crow is perching on a branch.",Then my teacher said,,"Really? Well, Young-ha, you may not be good at drawing but you have a talent for storytelling.",Or so I wished.,"Now you'll get it, you rascal!" was the response. (Laughter),"You'll get it!" he said.,You were supposed to draw the palace, the Gyeonghoeru, etc.,,but I was coloring everything in black,,so he dragged me out of the group.,There were a lot of girls there as well,,so I was utterly mortified. 
 None of my explanations or excuses were heard,,and I really got it big time.,If he was an ideal teacher, he would have responded like I said before,,"Young-ha may not have a talent for drawing,,but he has a gift for making up stories," and he would have encouraged me.,But such a teacher is seldom found.,Later, I grew up and went to Europe's galleries --,I was a university student -- and I thought this was really unfair.,Look what I found. (Laughter) 
 Works like this were hung in Basel while I was punished,and stood in front of the palace with my drawing in my mouth.,Look at this. Doesn't it look just like wallpaper?,Contemporary art, I later discovered, isn't explained by a lame story like mine.,No crows are brought up.,Most of the works have no title, Untitled.,Anyways, contemporary art in the 20th century,is about doing something weird and filling the void with explanation and interpretation --,essentially the same as I did.,Of course, my work was very amateur,,but let's turn to more famous examples. 
 This is Picasso's.,He stuck handlebars into a bike seat and called it "Bull's Head." Sounds convincing, right?,Next, a urinal was placed on its side and called "Fountain".,That was Duchamp.,So filling the gap between explanation and a weird act with stories --,that's indeed what contemporary art is all about.,Picasso even made the statement,,"I draw not what I see but what I think.",Yes, it means I didn't have to draw Gyeonghoeru.,I wish I knew what Picasso said back then. I could have argued better with my teacher.,Unfortunately, the little artists within us,are choked to death before we get to fight against the oppressors of art.,They get locked in.,That's our tragedy. 
 So what happens when little artists get locked in, banished or even killed?,Our artistic desire doesn't go away.,We want to express, to reveal ourselves,,but with the artist dead, the artistic desire reveals itself in dark form.,In karaoke bars, there are always people who sing,"She's Gone" or "Hotel California,",miming the guitar riffs.,Usually they sound awful. Awful indeed.,Some people turn into rockers like this.,Or some people dance in clubs.,People who would have enjoyed telling stories,end up trolling on the Internet all night long.,That's how a writing talent reveals itself on the dark side. 
 Sometimes we see dads get more excited than their kids,playing with Legos or putting together plastic robots.,They go, "Don't touch it. Daddy will do it for you.",The kid has already lost interest and is doing something else,,but the dad alone builds castles.,This shows the artistic impulses inside us are suppressed, not gone.,But they can often reveal themselves negatively, in the form of jealousy.,You know the song "I would love to be on TV"? Why would we love it?,TV is full of people who do what we wished to do,,but never got to.,They dance, they act -- and the more they do, they are praised.,So we start to envy them.,We become dictators with a remote and start to criticize the people on TV.,"He just can't act." "You call that singing? She can't hit the notes.",We easily say these sorts of things.,We get jealous, not because we're evil,,but because we have little artists pent up inside us.,That's what I think. 
 What should we do then?,Yes, that's right.,Right now, we need to start our own art.,Right this minute, we can turn off TV,,log off the Internet,,get up and start to do something.,Where I teach students in drama school,,there's a course called Dramatics.,In this course, all students must put on a play.,However, acting majors are not supposed to act.,They can write the play, for example,,and the writers may work on stage art.,Likewise, stage art majors may become actors, and in this way you put on a show.,Students at first wonder whether they can actually do it,,but later they have so much fun. I rarely see anyone who is miserable doing a play.,In school, the military or even in a mental institution, once you make people do it, they enjoy it.,I saw this happen in the army -- many people had fun doing plays. 
 I have another experience:,In my writing class, I give students a special assignment.,I have students like you in the class -- many who don't major in writing.,Some major in art or music and think they can't write.,So I give them blank sheets of paper and a theme.,It can be a simple theme:,Write about the most unfortunate experience in your childhood.,There's one condition: You must write like crazy. Like crazy!,I walk around and encourage them,,"Come on, come on!" They have to write like crazy for an hour or two.,They only get to think for the first five minutes. 
 The reason I make them write like crazy is because,when you write slowly and lots of thoughts cross your mind,,the artistic devil creeps in.,This devil will tell you hundreds of reasons,why you can't write:,"People will laugh at you. This is not good writing!,What kind of sentence is this? Look at your handwriting!",It will say a lot of things.,You have to run fast so the devil can't catch up.,The really good writing I've seen in my class,was not from the assignments with a long deadline,,but from the 40- to 60-minute crazy writing students did,in front of me with a pencil.,The students go into a kind of trance.,After 30 or 40 minutes, they write without knowing what they're writing.,And in this moment, the nagging devil disappears. 
 So I can say this:,It's not the hundreds of reasons why one can't be an artist,,but rather, the one reason one must be that makes us artists.,Why we cannot be something is not important.,Most artists became artists because of the one reason.,When we put the devil in our heart to sleep and start our own art,,enemies appear on the outside.,Mostly, they have the faces of our parents. (Laughter),Sometimes they look like our spouses,,but they are not your parents or spouses.,They are devils. Devils.,They came to Earth briefly transformed,to stop you from being artistic, from becoming artists.,And they have a magic question.,When we say, "I think I'll try acting. There's a drama school in the community center," or,"I'd like to learn Italian songs," they ask, "Oh, yeah? A play? What for?",The magic question is, "What for?",But art is not for anything.,Art is the ultimate goal.,It saves our souls and makes us live happily.,It helps us express ourselves and be happy without the help of alcohol or drugs.,So in response to such a pragmatic question,,we need to be bold.,"Well, just for the fun of it. Sorry for having fun without you,",is what you should say. "I'll just go ahead and do it anyway.",The ideal future I imagine is where we all have multiple identities,,at least one of which is an artist. 
 Once I was in New York and got in a cab. I took the backseat,,and in front of me I saw something related to a play.,So I asked the driver, "What is this?",He said it was his profile. "Then what are you?" I asked. "An actor," he said.,He was a cabby and an actor. I asked, "What roles do you usually play?",He proudly said he played King Lear.,King Lear.,"Who is it that can tell me who I am?" -- a great line from King Lear.,That's the world I dream of.,Someone is a golfer by day and writer by night.,Or a cabby and an actor, a banker and a painter,,secretly or publicly performing their own arts. 
 In 1990, Martha Graham, the legend of modern dance, came to Korea.,The great artist, then in her 90s, arrived at Gimpo Airport,and a reporter asked her a typical question:,"What do you have to do to become a great dancer?,Any advice for aspiring Korean dancers?",Now, she was the master. This photo was taken in 1948 and she was already a celebrated artist.,In 1990, she was asked this question.,And here's what she answered:,"Just do it.",Wow. I was touched.,Only those three words and she left the airport. That's it.,So what should we do now?,Let's be artists, right now. Right away. How?,Just do it! 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)My name's Seth Priebatsch.nI'm the chief ninja of SCVNGR.,I'm a proud Princeton dropout.,Also proud to have relocatednhere to Boston,,where I actually grew up. 
 (Applause) Yeah, Boston. 
 Easy wins, I should just namenthe counties that we've got around here.,I'm also fairly determinednto try and build,a game layer on top of the world.,This is sort of a new conceptnand it's really important,,because while the last decadenwas the decade of social,,the decade where the framework in whichnwe connect with other people was built,,this next decade will be the decadenwhere the game framework is built,,where the motivations we usento actually influence behavior,and the frameworknin which that is constructed,,is decided upon,nand that's really important. 
 I say I want to build a game layernon top of the world,,but that's not quite true,,because it's already under construction;nit's already happening.,And it looks like this right now.,It looks like the Web didnback in 1997, right?,It's not very good. It's cluttered.,It's filled with lots of different thingsnthat, in short, aren't that fun.,There are credit card schemesnand airline mile programs,,coupon cards and all these loyalty schemes,that actually do use game dynamicsnand are building the game layer --,they just suck.,They're not very well-designed. 
 (Laughter) 
 So that's unfortunate.,But luckily, as my favorite actionnhero, Bob the Builder, says,,"We can do better.nWe can build this better.",And the tools, the resourcesnthat we use to build a game layer,,are game dynamics themselves.,And so the crux of this presentationnis going to go through,four really important game dynamics,,really interesting things,nthat, if you use consciously,,you can use to influence behavior,,both for good, for bad, for in-between.,Hopefully for good.,But this is the important stagenin which that framework will get built,,and so we want to all be thinkingnabout it consciously now. 
 Before we jump into that,nthere's a question of:,Why is this important?,I'm making this claim,that there's a game layernon top of the world,,and it's very importantnthat we build it properly.,The reason it's so importantnis that, in the last decade,,what we've seen has beennbuilding the social layer,,has been this framework for connections,,and construction on that layernis over, it's finished.,There's still a lot to explore,,still a lot of peoplentrying to figure out social,and how we leverage thisnand how we use this,,but the framework itself is done,,and it's called Facebook.,And that's OK, right? A lot of peoplenare very happy with Facebook.,I like it quite a lot.,They've created this thingncalled the Open Graph,,and they own all of our connections.,They own half a billion people.,So when you want to buildnon the social layer,,the framework has been decided;nit is the Open Graph API.,And if you're happy with that, fantastic.,If you're not, too bad.nThere's nothing you can do. 
 And that's a real thing.,I mean, we want to build frameworksnin a way that makes it acceptable,and makes it productive down the road.,So, the social layernis all about these connections.,The game layer is all about influence.,It's not about addingna social fabric to the web,and connecting you to other people,everywhere you are and everywhere you go,,it's actually about usingndynamics, using forces,,to influence the behaviornof where you are, what you do there,,how you do it.,That's really, really powerful.,And it's going to be more importantnthan the social layer,,and affect our lives more deeplynand perhaps more invisibly.,So it's incredibly criticalnthat at this moment,,while it's just getting constructed,,while the frameworksnlike Facebook or Open Graph,are being creatednfor the game-layer equivalent,,that we think about it very consciously,,and that we do it in a waynthat is open, available,,and can be leveraged for good. 
 So that's what I want to talknabout for game dynamics,,because construction has just begun,,and the more consciouslynwe can think about this,,the better we'll be able to use itnfor anything we want.,So like I said, the way you gonthrough and build on the game layer,is not with glass and steel and cement.,And the resources we use are notnthis two-dimensional swath of land,that we have.,The resources are mindshare,,and the tools, the raw materials,nare these game dynamics.,With that, a couplengame dynamics to talk about.,Back at SCVNGR, we like to joke,that with seven game dynamics,nyou can get anyone to do anything.,Today, I'm going to show you four,,because I hope to have a competitivenadvantage at the end of this, still. 
 (Laughter) 
 So the first one,nit's a very simple game dynamic.,It's called the appointment dynamic.,It's a dynamic in which to succeed,,players have to do somethingnat a predefined time,,generally at a predefined place.,And these dynamicsnare a little scary sometimes,,because you think, "Other peoplencan be using forces,that will manipulate how I interact:,what I do, where I do it, when I do it.",This sort of "loss of free will"nthat occurs in games,can be frightening.,So with each dynamic,nI'm going to give three examples:,one that shows how it's alreadynbeing used in the real world,,so you can rationalize it a bit;,one that shows it in what we considerna conventional game --,I think everything is a game,,but this is more what you'd thinknof as a game played on a board,or on a computer screen;,and one of how it can be used for good,,so you can see that these forcesncan be very powerful. 
 So the first one, the most famousnappointment dynamic in the world,,is something called, "Happy Hour.",So I had just recentlyndropped out of Princeton,and actually ended upnfor the first time in a bar,,and I saw these happy hour thingsnall over the place.,And this is simply an appointment dynamic:ncome here at a certain time,,get your drinks half off.,To win, all you have to do is show upnat the right place at the right time.,This game dynamic is so powerful,,it doesn't just influence our behavior;nit's influenced our entire culture.,That's a really scary thought,,that one game dynamicncan change things so powerfully. 
 It also exists in morenconventional game forms.,I'm sure you've all heardnof Farmville by now.,If you haven't, I recommend playing it.,You won't do anything elsenfor the rest of your day.,Farmville has more activenusers than Twitter.,It's incredibly powerful,,and it has this dynamicnwhere you have to return at a certain time,to water your fake crops, or they wilt.,And this is so powerfulnthat when they tweak their stats,,when they say your crops wilt,after eight hours, or after six hours,nor after 24 hours,,it changes the life cyclenof some 70 million people during the day.,They will return, like clockwork,nat different times.,So if they wanted the world to end,nif they wanted productivity to stop,,they could make it a 30-minute cycle,,and no one could do anything else, right? 
 (Laughter) 
 That's a little scary.,But this could also be used for good.,This local company called Vitality,has created a product to help peoplentake their medicine on time.,That's an appointment.,It's something that peoplendon't do very well.,They have these GlowCapsnwhich flash and email you,and do cool things to remind younto take your medicine.,This isn't a game yet,nbut really should be.,You should get points for doing it on time,and lose points for not doing it on time.,They should recognize they've builtnan appointment dynamic,,and leverage the games.,Then you can really achieve goodnin some interesting ways. 
 We're going to jump onto the next one.,Influence and status.,This is one of the most famousngame dynamics, used all over the place.,It's used in your wallets, right now.,We all want that credit cardnon the far left, because it's black.,And you see someone at CVS or --,not CVS -- like, Christian Dior -- 
 (Laughter) 
 I don't know. I don't have a blackncard; I've got a debit card. 
 (Laughter) 
 So they whip it out and you seenthat black card, and:,"I want that because it meansnthey're cooler than I am,,and I need that.",And this is used in games as well.,"Modern Warfare," one of the mostnsuccessful selling games of all time.,I'm only a level four, but I desperatelynwant to be a level 10,,because they've got that cool red badge,,and that means that I am somehownbetter than everyone else.,And that's very powerful to me.,Status is really good motivator. 
 It's also used in morenconventional settings,,and can be used more consciously there.,School -- and remember,nI made it through one year,,so I think I'm qualifiednto talk on school --,is a game; it's just not a terriblynwell-designed game.,There are levels. There are C.nThere are B. There's A.,There are statuses. I mean,nwhat is valedictorian, but a status?,If we called valedictorianna "White Knight Paladin level 20,",I think people would probablynwork a lot harder. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 So school is a game,,and there has been lots of experimentationnon how we do this properly.,But let's use it consciously.,Why have games you can lose?nWhy go from an A to an F or a B to a C?,That sucks. Why not level-up?,At Princeton, they've actuallynexperimented with this,,with quizzes wherenyou gain experience points,,and you level up from B to an A.,And it's very powerful.,It can be used in interesting ways. 
 The third one I'll talk aboutnis the progression dynamic,,where you have to make progress,nmove through different steps,in a very granular fashion.,This is used all over the place,nincluding LinkedIn,,where I am an unwhole individual.,I am only 85 percent complete on LinkedIn,,and that bothers me.,And this is so deep-seated in our psyche,that when we're presentednwith a progress bar,and presented with easy,ngranular steps to take,to try and completenthat progress bar, we will do it.,We will find a way to move that blue line,all the way to the right edgenof the screen. 
 This is used in conventionalngames as well.,I mean, this is a Paladin level 10,,and that's a Paladin level 20.,And if you were going to fightnOrcs on the fields of Mordor,against the Ra's Al Ghul,,you'd probably want to benthe bigger one, right?,I would.,And so people work very hard to level-up.,"World of Warcraft" is onenof the most successful games of all time.,The average player spends some six,nsix-and-a-half hours a day on it,,their most dedicated players --nit's like a full-time job, it's insane.,And they have these systemsnwhere you can level-up.,And that's a very powerful thing.nProgression is powerful. 
 It can also be usednin very compelling ways for good.,One of the things we work on at SCVNGR is:,How do you use games to drive trafficnand business to local businesses,,to something that is very keynto the economy?,And here, we have a game that people play.,They go places,ndo challenges, earn points.,And we've introducedna progression dynamic into it,,where, by going to the same placenover and over, doing challenges,,engaging with the business,,you move a green bar from the left edgenof the screen to the right,,and unlock rewards.,This is powerful enough that we can seenit hooks people into these dynamics,,pulls them back to the samenlocal businesses,,creates loyalty, creates engagement,,and is able to drive meaningful revenuenand fun and engagement to businesses.,These progression dynamics are powerfulnand can be used in the real world. 
 The final one I want to talk about --nand it's a great one to end on --,is this concept of communal discovery,,a dynamic in which everyonenhas to work together to achieve something.,Communal discovery is powerful,because it leveragesnthe network that is society,to solve problems.,This is used in some famousnconsumer web stories like Digg,,which I'm sure you've all heard of.,Digg is a communal dynamic,to try to find and source the best news,nthe most interesting stories.,And they made this into a game, initially.,They had a leader board where,nif you recommended the best stories,,you would get points.,And that really motivated peoplento find the best stories.,But it became so powerful,nthere was actually a cabal,,a group of people, the top sevennon the leader board,,who would work together to make surenthey maintained that position,,recommending people's stories. 
 The game becamenmore powerful than the goal.,They ended up shutting down the leadernboard because, while it was effective,,it was so powerful that it stoppednsourcing the best stories,,and started having people worknto maintain leadership.,So we have to use this one carefully.,It's also used in thingsnlike McDonald's Monopoly,,where the game is notnthe Monopoly you're playing,,but the cottage industriesnthat form to try and find Boardwalk.,There, they're just lookingnfor a sticker that says "Boardwalk,",but it can also be usednto find real things.,This is the DARPA balloon challenge,,where they hid a couple balloonsnall across the United States and said,,"Use networks. Try and findnthese balloons fastest,,and the winner will get $40,000.",The winner was a group out of MIT,,where they created sortnof a pyramid scheme, a network,,where the first person to recommendnthe location of a balloon got $2,000,,and anyone else to pushnthat recommendation up also got a cut.,And in 12 hours, they were ablento find all these balloons,,all across the country.,Really powerful dynamic. 
 And so, I've got about 20 seconds left,,so if I'm going to leavenyou with anything,,last decade was the decade of social.,This next decade is the decade of games.,We use game dynamics to build on it.nWe build with mindshare.,We can influence behavior.,It's very powerful. It's very exciting.,Let's all build it together,nlet's do it well and have fun playing. 
 (Applause)Hello. My name is Birke Baehr,,and I'm 11 years old.,I came here today to talk about what's wrong with our food system.,First of all, I would like to say,that I'm really amazed at how easily kids are led to believe,all the marketing and advertising,on TV, at public schools,and pretty much everywhere else you look.,It seems to me like corporations,are always trying to get kids, like me,,to get their parents to buy stuff,that really isn't good for us or the planet.,Little kids, especially,,are attracted by colorful packaging,and plastic toys.,I must admit, I used to be one of them.,I also used to think that all of our food,came from these happy, little farms,where pigs rolled in mud and cows grazed on grass all day. 
 What I discovered was this is not true.,I began to look into this stuff,on the Internet, in books and in documentary films,,in my travels with my family.,I discovered the dark side of the industrialized food system.,First, there's genetically engineered seeds and organisms.,That is when a seed is manipulated in a laboratory,to do something not intended by nature --,like taking the DNA of a fish,and putting it into the DNA of a tomato. Yuck.,Don't get me wrong, I like fish and tomatoes,,but this is just creepy.,(Laughter),The seeds are then planted, then grown.,The food they produce have been proven,to cause cancer and other problems in lab animals,,and people have been eating food produced this way,since the 1990s.,And most folks don't even know they exist.,Did you know rats that ate genetically engineered corn,had developed signs of liver and kidney toxicity?,These include kidney inflammation and lesions and increased kidney weight.,Yet almost all the corn we eat,has been altered genetically in some way.,And let me tell you,,corn is in everything.,And don't even get me started on the Confined Animal Feeding Operations,called CAFOS. 
 (Laughter) 
 Conventional farmers use chemical fertilizers,made from fossil fuels,that they mix with the dirt to make plants grow.,They do this because they've stripped the soil from all nutrients,from growing the same crop over and over again.,Next, more harmful chemicals are sprayed on fruits and vegetables,,like pesticides and herbicides,,to kill weeds and bugs.,When it rains, these chemicals seep into the ground,,or run off into our waterways,,poisoning our water too.,Then they irradiate our food, trying to make it last longer,,so it can travel thousands of miles,from where it's grown to the supermarkets. 
 So I ask myself,,how can I change? How can I change these things?,This is what I found out.,I discovered that there's a movement for a better way.,Now a while back,,I wanted to be an NFL football player.,I decided that I'd rather be an organic farmer instead.,(Applause),Thank you.,And that way I can have a greater impact on the world.,This man, Joel Salatin, they call him a lunatic farmer,because he grows against the system.,Since I'm home-schooled,,I went to go hear him speak one day.,This man, this "lunatic farmer,",doesn't use any pesticides, herbicides,,or genetically modified seeds.,And so for that, he's called crazy by the system. 
 I want you to know that we can all make a difference,by making different choices,,by buying our food directly from local farmers,,or our neighbors who we know in real life.,Some people say organic or local food is more expensive,,but is it really?,With all these things I've been learning about the food system,,it seems to me that we can either pay the farmer,,or we can pay the hospital.,(Applause),Now I know definitely which one I would choose.,I want you to know that there are farms out there --,like Bill Keener in Sequatchie Cove Farm in Tennessee --,whose cows do eat grass,and whose pigs do roll in the mud, just like I thought.,Sometimes I go to Bill's farm and volunteer,,so I can see up close and personal,where the meat I eat comes from.,I want you to know that I believe,kids will eat fresh vegetables and good food,if they know more about it and where it really comes from.,I want you to know that there are farmers' markets,in every community popping up.,I want you to know that me, my brother and sister,actually like eating baked kale chips.,I try to share this everywhere I go. 
 Not too long ago,,my uncle said that he offered my six-year-old cousin cereal.,He asked him if he wanted organic Toasted O's,or the sugarcoated flakes --,you know, the one with the big striped cartoon character on the front.,My little cousin told his dad,that he would rather have the organic Toasted O's cereal,because Birke said he shouldn't eat sparkly cereal.,And that, my friends, is how we can make a difference,one kid at a time. 
 So next time you're at the grocery store, think local,,choose organic, know your farmer and know your food.,Thank you. 
 (Applause)So today, I'm going to tell you about some people,who didn't move out of their neighborhoods.,The first one is happening right here in Chicago.,Brenda Palms-Farber was hired,to help ex-convicts reenter society,and keep them from going back into prison.,Currently, taxpayers spend,about 60,000 dollars per year,sending a person to jail.,We know that two-thirds of them are going to go back.,I find it interesting that, for every one dollar,we spend, however, on early childhood education,,like Head Start,,we save 17 dollars,on stuff like incarceration in the future.,Or -- think about it -- that 60,000 dollars,is more than what it costs,to send one person to Harvard as well. 
 But Brenda, not being phased by stuff like that,,took a look at her challenge,and came up,with a not-so-obvious solution:,create a business,that produces skin care products from honey.,Okay, it might be obvious to some of you; it wasn't to me.,It's the basis of growing a form of social innovation,that has real potential.,She hired seemingly unemployable men and women,to care for the bees, harvest the honey,and make value-added products,that they marketed themselves,,and that were later sold at Whole Foods.,She combined employment experience and training,with life skills they needed,,like anger-management and teamwork,,and also how to talk to future employers,about how their experiences,actually demonstrated the lessons that they had learned,and their eagerness to learn more.,Less than four percent,of the folks that went through her program,actually go back to jail.,So these young men and women learned job-readiness,and life skills through bee keeping,and became productive citizens in the process.,Talk about a sweet beginning. 
 Now, I'm going to take you to Los Angeles,,and lots of people know,that L.A. has its issues.,But I'm going to talk about L.A.'s water issues right now.,They have not enough water on most days,and too much to handle when it rains.,Currently, 20 percent,of California's energy consumption,is used to pump water,into mostly Southern California.,Their spending loads, loads,,to channel that rainwater out into the ocean,when it rains and floods as well.,Now Andy Lipkis is working to help,L.A. cut infrastructure costs,associated with water management and urban heat island --,linking trees, people and technology,to create a more livable city.,All that green stuff actually naturally absorbs storm water,,also helps cool our cities.,Because, come to think about it,,do you really want air-conditioning,,or is it a cooler room that you want?,How you get it shouldn't make that much of a difference. 
 So a few years ago,,L.A. County,decided that they needed to spend 2.5 billion dollars,to repair the city schools.,And Andy and his team discovered,that they were going to spend 200 million of those dollars,on asphalt to surround the schools themselves.,And by presenting a really strong economic case,,they convinced the L.A. government,that replacing that asphalt,with trees and other greenery,,that the schools themselves would save the system more on energy,than they spend on horticultural infrastructure.,So ultimately, 20 million square feet of asphalt,was replaced or avoided,,and electrical consumption for air-conditioning went down,,while employment,for people to maintain those grounds went up,,resulting in a net-savings to the system,,but also healthier students and schools system employees as well. 
 Now Judy Bonds,is a coal miner's daughter.,Her family has eight generations,in a town called Whitesville, West Virginia.,And if anyone should be clinging,to the former glory of the coal mining history,,and of the town,,it should be Judy.,But the way coal is mined right now is different,from the deep mines that her father,and her father's father would go down into,and that employed essentially thousands and thousands of people.,Now, two dozen men,can tear down a mountain in several months,,and only for about a few years' worth of coal.,That kind of technology is called "mountaintop removal.",It can make a mountain go from this to this,in a few short months.,Just imagine that the air surrounding these places --,it's filled with the residue of explosives and coal.,When we visited, it gave some of the people we were with,this strange little cough,after being only there for just a few hours or so --,not just miners, but everybody. 
 And Judy saw her landscape being destroyed,and her water poisoned.,And the coal companies just move on,after the mountain was emptied,,leaving even more unemployment in their wake.,But she also saw the difference in potential wind energy,on an intact mountain,,and one that was reduced in elevation,by over 2,000 feet.,Three years of dirty energy with not many jobs,,or centuries of clean energy,with the potential for developing expertise and improvements in efficiency,based on technical skills,,and developing local knowledge,about how to get the most out of that region's wind.,She calculated the up-front cost,and the payback over time,,and it's a net-plus on so many levels,for the local, national and global economy.,It's a longer payback than mountaintop removal,,but the wind energy actually pays back forever.,Now mountaintop removal pays very little money to the locals,,and it gives them a lot of misery.,The water is turned into goo.,Most people are still unemployed,,leading to most of the same kinds of social problems,that unemployed people in inner cities also experience --,drug and alcohol abuse,,domestic abuse, teen pregnancy and poor heath, as well. 
 Now Judy and I -- I have to say --,totally related to each other.,Not quite an obvious alliance.,I mean, literally, her hometown is called Whitesville, West Virginia.,I mean, they are not --,they ain't competing for the birthplace of hip hop title,or anything like that.,But the back of my T-shirt, the one that she gave me,,says, "Save the endangered hillbillies.",So homegirls and hillbillies we got it together,and totally understand that this is what it's all about.,But just a few months ago,,Judy was diagnosed,with stage-three lung cancer.,Yeah.,And it has since moved to her bones and her brain.,And I just find it so bizarre,that she's suffering from the same thing,that she tried so hard to protect people from.,But her dream,of Coal River Mountain Wind,is her legacy.,And she might not,get to see that mountaintop.,But rather than writing,yet some kind of manifesto or something,,she's leaving behind,a business plan to make it happen.,That's what my homegirl is doing.,So I'm so proud of that. 
 (Applause) 
 But these three people,don't know each other,,but they do have an awful lot in common.,They're all problem solvers,,and they're just some of the many examples,that I really am privileged to see, meet and learn from,in the examples of the work that I do now.,I was really lucky to have them all featured,on my Corporation for Public Radio radio show,called ThePromisedLand.org.,Now they're all very practical visionaries.,They take a look at the demands that are out there --,beauty products, healthy schools, electricity --,and how the money's flowing to meet those demands.,And when the cheapest solutions,involve reducing the number of jobs,,you're left with unemployed people,,and those people aren't cheap.,In fact, they make up some of what I call the most expensive citizens,,and they include generationally impoverished,,traumatized vets returning from the Middle East,,people coming out of jail.,And for the veterans in particular,,the V.A. said there's a six-fold increase,in mental health pharmaceuticals by vets since 2003.,I think that number's probably going to go up.,They're not the largest number of people,,but they are some of the most expensive --,and in terms of the likelihood for domestic abuse, drug and alcohol abuse,,poor performance by their kids in schools,and also poor health as a result of stress.,So these three guys all understand,how to productively channel dollars,through our local economies,to meet existing market demands,,reduce the social problems that we have now,and prevent new problems in the future. 
 And there are plenty of other examples like that.,One problem: waste handling and unemployment.,Even when we think or talk about recycling,,lots of recyclable stuff ends up getting incinerated or in landfills,and leaving many municipalities, diversion rates --,they leave much to be recycled.,And where is this waste handled? Usually in poor communities.,And we know that eco-industrial business, these kinds of business models --,there's a model in Europe called the eco-industrial park,,where either the waste of one company is the raw material for another,,or you use recycled materials,to make goods that you can actually use and sell.,We can create these local markets and incentives,for recycled materials,to be used as raw materials for manufacturing.,And in my hometown, we actually tried to do one of these in the Bronx,,but our mayor decided what he wanted to see,was a jail on that same spot.,Fortunately -- because we wanted to create hundreds of jobs --,but after many years,,the city wanted to build a jail.,They've since abandoned that project, thank goodness. 
 Another problem: unhealthy food systems and unemployment.,Working-class and poor urban Americans,are not benefiting economically,from our current food system.,It relies too much on transportation,,chemical fertilization, big use of water,and also refrigeration.,Mega agricultural operations,often are responsible for poisoning our waterways and our land,,and it produces this incredibly unhealthy product,that costs us billions in healthcare,and lost productivity.,And so we know "urban ag",is a big buzz topic this time of the year,,but it's mostly gardening,,which has some value in community building -- lots of it --,but it's not in terms of creating jobs,or for food production.,The numbers just aren't there.,Part of my work now is really laying the groundwork,to integrate urban ag and rural food systems,to hasten the demise of the 3,000-mile salad,by creating a national brand of urban-grown produce,in every city,,that uses regional growing power,and augments it with indoor growing facilities,,owned and operated by small growers,,where now there are only consumers.,This can support seasonal farmers around metro areas,who are losing out because they really can't meet,the year-round demand for produce.,It's not a competition with rural farm;,it's actually reinforcements.,It allies in a really positive,and economically viable food system. 
 The goal is to meet the cities' institutional demands,for hospitals,,senior centers, schools, daycare centers,,and produce a network of regional jobs, as well.,This is smart infrastructure.,And how we manage our built environment,affects the health and well-being of people every single day.,Our municipalities, rural and urban,,play the operational course of infrastructure --,things like waste disposal, energy demand,,as well as social costs of unemployment, drop-out rates, incarceration rates,and the impacts of various public health costs.,Smart infrastructure can provide cost-saving ways,for municipalities to handle,both infrastructure and social needs.,And we want to shift the systems,that open the doors for people who were formerly tax burdens,to become part of the tax base.,And imagine a national business model,that creates local jobs and smart infrastructure,to improve local economic stability.,So I'm hoping you can see a little theme here. 
 These examples indicate a trend.,I haven't created it, and it's not happening by accident.,I'm noticing that it's happening all over the country,,and the good news is that it's growing.,And we all need to be invested in it.,It is an essential pillar to this country's recovery.,And I call it "hometown security.",The recession has us reeling and fearful,,and there's something in the air these days,that is also very empowering.,It's a realization,that we are the key,to our own recovery.,Now is the time for us to act in our own communities,where we think local and we act local.,And when we do that, our neighbors --,be they next-door, or in the next state,,or in the next country --,will be just fine.,The sum of the local is the global.,Hometown security means rebuilding our natural defenses,,putting people to work,,restoring our natural systems.,Hometown security means creating wealth here at home,,instead of destroying it overseas.,Tackling social and environmental problems,at the same time with the same solution,yields great cost savings,,wealth generation and national security.,Many great and inspiring solutions,have been generated across America.,The challenge for us now,is to identify and support countless more. 
 Now, hometown security is about taking care of your own,,but it's not like the old saying,,"charity begins at home.",I recently read a book called "Love Leadership" by John Hope Bryant.,And it's about leading in a world,that really does seem to be operating on the basis of fear.,And reading that book made me reexamine that theory,because I need to explain what I mean by that.,See, my dad,was a great, great man in many ways.,He grew up in the segregated South,,escaped lynching and all that,during some really hard times,,and he provided a really stable home for me and my siblings,and a whole bunch of other people that fell on hard times.,But, like all of us, he had some problems.,(Laughter),And his was gambling,,compulsively.,To him that phrase, "Charity begins at home,",meant that my payday -- or someone else's --,would just happen to coincide with his lucky day.,So you need to help him out.,And sometimes I would loan him money,from my after-school or summer jobs,,and he always had the great intention,of paying me back with interest,,of course, after he hit it big.,And he did sometimes, believe it or not,,at a racetrack in Los Angeles --,one reason to love L.A. -- back in the 1940s.,He made 15,000 dollars cash,and bought the house that I grew up in.,So I'm not that unhappy about that.,But listen, I did feel obligated to him,,and I grew up -- then I grew up.,And I'm a grown woman now,,and I have learned a few things along the way. 
 To me, charity,often is just about giving,,because you're supposed to,,or because it's what you've always done,,or it's about giving until it hurts.,I'm about providing the means,to build something that will grow,and intensify its original investment,and not just require greater giving next year --,I'm not trying to feed the habit.,I spent some years,watching how good intentions for community empowerment,,that were supposed to be there,to support the community and empower it,,actually left people,in the same, if not worse, position that they were in before.,And over the past 20 years,,we've spent record amounts of philanthropic dollars,on social problems,,yet educational outcomes,,malnutrition, incarceration,,obesity, diabetes, income disparity,,they've all gone up with some exceptions --,in particular, infant mortality,among people in poverty --,but it's a great world that we're bringing them into as well. 
 And I know a little bit about these issues,,because, for many years, I spent a long time,in the non-profit industrial complex,,and I'm a recovering executive director,,two years clean.,(Laughter),But during that time, I realized that it was about projects,and developing them on the local level,that really was going to do the right thing for our communities.,But I really did struggle for financial support.,The greater our success,,the less money came in from foundations.,And I tell you, being on the TED stage,and winning a MacArthur in the same exact year,gave everyone the impression that I had arrived.,And by the time I'd moved on,,I was actually covering a third,of my agency's budget deficit with speaking fees.,And I think because early on, frankly,,my programs were just a little bit ahead of their time.,But since then,,the park that was just a dump and was featured at a TED2006 Talk,became this little thing.,But I did in fact get married in it.,Over here.,There goes my dog who led me to the park in my wedding.,The South Bronx Greenway,was also just a drawing on the stage back in 2006.,Since then, we got,about 50 million dollars in stimulus package money,to come and get here.,And we love this, because I love construction now,,because we're watching these things actually happen. 
 So I want everyone to understand,the critical importance,of shifting charity into enterprise.,I started my firm to help communities across the country,realize their own potential,to improve everything about the quality of life for their people.,Hometown security,is next on my to-do list.,What we need are people who see the value,in investing in these types of local enterprises,,who will partner with folks like me,to identify the growth trends and climate adaptation,as well as understand the growing social costs,of business as usual.,We need to work together,to embrace and repair our land,,repair our power systems,and repair ourselves.,It's time to stop building,the shopping malls, the prisons,,the stadiums,and other tributes to all of our collective failures.,It is time that we start building,living monuments to hope and possibility. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I'm here today to shownmy photographs of the Lakota.,Many of you may have heard of the Lakota,,or at least the larger group of tribes,,called the Sioux.,The Lakota are one of many tribesnthat were moved off their land,to prisoner-of-war camps,,now called reservations.,The Pine Ridge Reservation,,the subject of today's slide show,,is located about 75 miles southeastnof the Black Hills in South Dakota.,It is sometimes referred tonas Prisoner of War Camp Number 334,,and it is where the Lakota now live.,Now, if any of you have ever heard of AIM,,the American Indian Movement,,or of Russell Means,,or Leonard Peltier,,or of the standoff at Oglala,,then you know Pine Ridge is ground zeronfor Native issues in the US. 
 So I've been asked to talkna little bit today,about my relationship with the Lakota,,and that's a very difficult one for me,,because, if you haven'tnnoticed from my skin color,,I'm white,,and that is a huge barriernon a Native reservation.,You'll see a lot of peoplenin my photographs today.,I've become very close with them,nand they've welcomed me like family.,They've called me "brother" and "uncle,",and invited me again and againnover five years.,But on Pine Ridge,,I will always be what is called "wasichu.","Wasichu" is a Lakota word,that means "non-Indian,",but another version of this word,means "the one who takesnthe best meat for himself.",And that's what I want to focus on --,the one who takesnthe best part of the meat.,It means "greedy." 
 So take a look aroundnthis auditorium today.,We are at a private schoolnin the American West,,sitting in red velvet chairs,with money in our pockets.,And if we look at our lives,,we have indeed takennthe best part of the meat.,So let's look todaynat a set of photographs,of a people who lost,so that we could gain,,and know that when you seenthese people's faces,,that these are not justnimages of the Lakota;,they stand for all indigenous people. 
 On this piece of paper,is the history the way I learned itnfrom my Lakota friends and family.,The following is a time linenof treaties made, treaties broken,and massacres disguised as battles.,I'll begin in 1824.,What is known asnthe Bureau of Indian Affairs,was created within the War Department,,setting an early tone of aggression,in our dealings with the Native Americans. 
 1851:,The first treaty of Fort Laramie was made,,clearly marking the boundariesnof the Lakota Nation.,According to the treaty,nthose lands are a sovereign nation.,If the boundariesnof this treaty had held --,and there is a legal basisnthat they should --,then this is what the USnwould look like today.,Ten years later.,The Homestead Act,nsigned by President Lincoln,,unleashed a flood of white settlersninto Native lands. 
 1863:,An uprising of Santee Sioux in Minnesota,ends with the hanging of 38 Sioux men,,the largest mass execution in US history.,The execution was orderednby President Lincoln,,only two days after he signednthe Emancipation Proclamation. 
 1866: The beginningnof the Transcontinental Railroad --,a new era.,We appropriated land for trails and trains,to shortcut through the heartnof the Lakota Nation.,The treaties were out the window.,In response, three tribes lednby the Lakota chief Red Cloud,attacked and defeated the US army,,many times over.,I want to repeat that part:,The Lakota defeat the US army. 
 1868: The second Fort Laramie Treatynclearly guarantees,the sovereignty of the Great Sioux Nation,and the Lakotas' ownershipnof the sacred Black Hills.,The government also promisesnland and hunting rights,in the surrounding states.,We promise that the Powder River country,will henceforth be closed to all whites.,The treaty seemed to be a complete victory,for Red Cloud and the Sioux.,In fact, this is the only warnin American history,in which the government negotiated a peace,by conceding everythingndemanded by the enemy. 
 1869: The TranscontinentalnRailroad was completed.,It began carrying, among other things,nlarge numbers of hunters,,who began the wholesalenkilling of buffalo,,eliminating a source of food,nclothing and shelter for the Sioux. 
 1871:,The Indian Appropriation Act,makes all Indiansnwards of the federal government.,In addition, the military issued orders,forbidding western Indiansnfrom leaving reservations.,All western Indians at that point in timenwere now prisoners of war.,Also in 1871,,we ended the time of treaty-making.,The problem with treaties is they allowntribes to exist as sovereign nations,,and we can't have that.,We had plans. 
 1874:,General George Custer announcednthe discovery of gold in Lakota territory,,specifically the Black Hills.,The news of gold createsna massive influx of white settlers,into Lakota Nation.,Custer recommends that Congress find a way,to end the treaties with the Lakotanas soon as possible. 
 1875: The Lakota war begins,over the violationnof the Fort Laramie Treaty.,1876:,On July 26th,,on its way to attack a Lakota village,,Custer's 7th Cavalry was crushed,at the battle of Little Big Horn.,1877:,The great Lakota warriornand chief named Crazy Horse,surrendered at Fort Robinson.,He was later killed while in custody.,1877 is also the year we found a waynto get around the Fort Laramie Treaties.,A new agreement was presentednto Sioux chiefs and their leading men,,under a campaign knownnas "Sell or Starve" --,sign the paper, or no food for your tribe.,Only 10 percent of the adultnmale population signed.,The Fort Laramie Treaty callednfor at least three-quarters of the tribe,to sign away land.,That clause was obviously ignored. 
 1887: The Dawes Act.,Communal ownershipnof reservation lands ends.,Reservations are cut upninto 160-acre sections,,and distributed to individual Indians,with the surplus disposed of.,Tribes lost millions of acres.,The American dreamnof individual land ownership,turned out to be a very clever way,to divide the reservationnuntil nothing was left.,The move destroyed the reservations,,making it easiernto further subdivide and to sell,with every passing generation.,Most of the surplus land,and many of the plotsnwithin reservation boundaries,are now in the hands of white ranchers.,Once again, the fat of the landngoes to wasichu. 
 1890: A date I believe to benthe most important in this slide show.,This is the yearnof the Wounded Knee Massacre.,On December 29,,US troops surrounded a Siouxnencampment at Wounded Knee Creek,,and massacred Chief Big Footnand 300 prisoners of war,,using a new rapid-fire weaponnthat fired exploding shells,,called a Hotchkiss gun.,For this so-called "battle,",20 Congressional Medals of Honor for Valor,were given to the 7th Cavalry.,To this day,,this is the most Medals of Honornever awarded for a single battle.,More Medals of Honor were given,for the indiscriminate slaughternof women and children,than for any battle in World War One,,World War Two,,Korea, Vietnam,,Iraq or Afghanistan. 
 The Wounded Knee Massacrenis considered the end of the Indian wars.,Whenever I visit the sitenof the mass grave at Wounded Knee,,I see it not just as a gravenfor the Lakota or for the Sioux,,but as a grave for all indigenous peoples.,The holy man Black Elk, said,,"I did not know then how much was ended.,When I look back nownfrom this high hill of my old age,,I can still seenthe butchered women and children,lying heaped and scatterednall along the crooked gulch,,as plain as when I saw them,with eyes still young.,And I can see that something elsendied there in the bloody mud,and was buried in the blizzard.,A people's dream died there.,And it was a beautiful dream." 
 With this event,,a new era in Native Americannhistory began.,Everything can be measurednbefore Wounded Knee and after,,because it was in this moment,,with the fingers on the triggersnof the Hotchkiss guns,,that the US government openlyndeclared its position on Native rights.,They were tired of treaties.,They were tired of sacred hills.,They were tired of ghost dances.,And they were tired of allnthe inconveniences of the Sioux.,So they brought out their cannons.,"You want to be an Indian now?" they said,,finger on the trigger. 
 1900:,the US Indian populationnreached its low point --,less than 250,000,,compared to an estimatedneight million in 1492. 
 Fast-forward.,1980:,The longest-runningncourt case in US history,,the Sioux Nation versus the United States,,was ruled upon by the US Supreme Court.,The court determined that when the Siouxnwere resettled onto reservations,and seven million acresnof their land were opened up,to prospectors and homesteaders,,the terms of the secondnFort Laramie Treaty,had been violated.,The court stated that the Black Hillsnwere illegally taken,,and that the initialnoffering price, plus interest,,should be paid to the Sioux Nation.,As payment for the Black Hills,,the court awarded only 106 million dollarsnto the Sioux Nation.,The Sioux refused the moneynwith the rallying cry,,"The Black Hills are not for sale." 
 2010:,Statistics about Native population today,,more than a centurynafter the massacre at Wounded Knee,,reveal the legacy of colonization,,forced migration,and treaty violations.,Unemployment on the Pine RidgenIndian Reservation,fluctuates between 85 and 90 percent.,The housing office is unablento build new structures,,and existing structures are falling apart.,Many are homeless,,and those with homesnare packed into rotting buildings,with up to five families.,Thirty-nine percent of homes on Pine Ridge,have no electricity.,At least 60 percentnof the homes on the reservation,are infested with black mold.,More than 90 percent of the populationnlives below the federal poverty line.,The tuberculosis rate on Pine Ridge,is approximately eight times highernthan the US national average.,The infant mortality ratenis the highest on this continent,,and is about three times highernthan the US national average.,Cervical cancer is five times higher,than the US national average.,The school dropout ratenis up to 70 percent.,Teacher turnover is eight times highernthan the US national average.,Frequently, grandparentsnare raising their grandchildren,because parents, due to alcoholism,,domestic violence and general apathy,,cannot raise them.,Fifty percent of the populationnover the age of 40,suffers from diabetes.,The life expectancy for mennis between 46 and 48 years old --,roughly the samenas in Afghanistan and Somalia. 
 The last chapternin any successful genocide,is the one in which the oppressor,can remove their hands and say,,"My god -- what are these peoplendoing to themselves?,They're killing each other.,They're killing themselves,while we watch them die.",This is how we came to ownnthese United States.,This is the legacy,of Manifest Destiny.,Prisoners are still bornninto prisoner of war camps,,long after the guards are gone.,These are the bonesnleft after the best meat has been taken. 
 A long time ago,,a series of events was set in motion,by a people who look like me, by wasichu,,eager to take the land and the waternand the gold in the hills.,Those events led to a domino effectnthat has yet to end. 
 As removed as we,nthe dominant society, may feel,from a massacre in 1890,,or a series of brokenntreaties 150 years ago,,I still have to ask you the question:,How should you feelnabout the statistics of today?,What is the connectionnbetween these images of suffering,and the history that I just read to you?,And how much of this historyndo you need to own, even?,Is any of this your responsibility today?,I have been told that there must bensomething we can do.,There must be some call to action.,Because for so long,nI've been standing on the sidelines,,content to be a witness,,just taking photographs.,Because the solutionsnseem so far in the past,,I needed nothing shortnof a time machine to access them. 
 The suffering of indigenous peoplesnis not a simple issue to fix.,It's not something everyone can get behind,the way they get behind helping Haiti,,or ending AIDS, or fighting a famine.,The "fix," as it's called,,may be much more difficultnfor the dominant society,than, say, a $50 check,or a church trip to paintnsome graffiti-covered houses,,or a suburban family,donating a box of clothesnthey don't even want anymore.,So where does that leave us?,Shrugging our shoulders in the dark? 
 The United States continuesnon a daily basis to violate the terms,of the 1851 and 1868nFort Laramie Treaties with the Lakota.,The call to action I offer today --,my TED wish -- is this:,Honor the treaties.,Give back the Black Hills.,It's not your businessnwhat they do with them. 
 (Applause)We are here today,because [the] United Nations,have defined goals,for the progress of countries.,They're called Millennium Development Goals.,And the reason I really like these goals,is that there are eight of them.,And by specifying eight different goals,,the United Nations has said,that there are so many things needed,to change in a country,in order to get the good life for people.,Look here -- you have to end poverty,,education, gender,,child and maternal health,,control infections, protect the environment,and get the good global links between nations,in every aspect,from aid to trade. 
 There's a second reason I like these development goals,,and that is because each and every one is measured.,Take child mortality;,the aim here is to reduce child mortality,by two-thirds,,from 1990 to 2015.,That's a four percent reduction per year --,and this, with measuring.,That's what makes the difference,between political talking like this,and really going for the important thing,,a better life for people.,And what I'm so happy about with this,is that we have already documented,that there are many countries,in Asia, in the Middle East,,in Latin America and East Europe,that [are] reducing with this rate.,And even mighty Brazil is going down with five percent per year,,and Turkey with seven percent per year.,So there's good news.,But then I hear people saying, "There is no progress in Africa.,And there's not even statistics on Africa,to know what is happening.",I'll prove them wrong on both points. 
 Come with me to the wonderful world of statistics.,I bring you to the webpage, ChildMortality.org,,where you can take deaths in children,below five years of age for all countries --,it's done by U.N. specialists.,And I will take Kenya as an example.,Here you see the data.,Don't panic -- don't panic now, I'll help you through this.,It looks nasty, like in college,when you didn't like statistics.,But first thing, when you see dots like this,,you have to ask yourself:,from where do the data come?,What is the origin of the data?,Is it so that in Kenya,,there are doctors and other specialists,who write the death certificate at the death of the child,and it's sent to the statistical office?,No -- low-income countries like Kenya,still don't have that level of organization.,It exists, but it's not complete,because so many deaths occur in the home,with the family,,and it's not registered.,What we rely on is not an incomplete system.,We have interviews, we have surveys.,And this is highly professional,female interviewers,who sit down for one hour with a woman,and ask her about [her] birth history.,How many children did you have?,Are they alive?,If they died, at what age and what year?,And then this is done in a representative sample,of thousands of women in the country,and put together in what used to be called,a demographic health survey report.,But these surveys are costly,,so they can only be done [in] three- to five-year intervals.,But they have good quality.,So this is a limitation.,And all these colored lines here are results;,each color is one survey.,But that's too complicated for today, so I'll simplify it for you,,and I give you one average point for each survey. 
 This was 1977, 1988,,1992, '97,and 2002.,And when the experts in the U.N.,have got these surveys in place in their database,,then they use advanced mathematical formulas,to produce a trend line, and the trend line looks like this.,See here -- it's the best fit they can get of this point.,But watch out --,they continue the line,beyond the last point,out into nothing.,And they estimated that in 2008,,Kenya had per child mortality of 128.,And I was sad,,because we could see,this reversal in Kenya,with an increased child mortality in the 90s.,It was so tragic.,But in June, I got a mail in my inbox,from Demographic Health Surveys,,and it showed good news from Kenya.,I was so happy.,This was the estimate of the new survey.,Then it just took another three months,for [the] U.N. to get it into their server,,and on Friday we got the new trend line --,it was down here.,Isn't it nice -- isn't it nice, yeah?,I was actually, on Friday, sitting in front of my computer,,and I saw the death rate fall,from 128 to 84 just that morning.,So we celebrated. 
 But now, when you have this trend line,,how do we measure progress?,I'm going into some details here,,because [the] U.N. do it like this.,They start [in] 1990 -- they measure to 2009.,They say, "0.9 percent, no progress.",That's unfair.,As a professor, I think I have the right to propose something differently.,I would say, at least do this --,10 years is enough to follow the trend.,It's two surveys, and you can see what's happening now.,They have 2.4 percent.,Had I been in the Ministry of Health in Kenya,,I may have joined these two points.,So what I'm telling you,is that we know the child mortality.,We have a decent trend.,It's coming into some tricky things then,when we are measuring MDGs.,And the reason here for Africa is especially important,,because '90s was a bad decade,,not only in Kenya, but across Africa.,The HIV epidemic peaked.,There was resistance for the old malaria drugs, until we got the new drugs.,We got, later, the mosquito netting.,And there was socio-economic problems,,which are now being solved at a much better scale.,So look at the average here --,this is the average for all of sub-Saharan Africa.,And [the] U.N. says,it's a reduction with 1.8 percent. 
 Now this sounds a little theoretical,,but it's not so theoretical.,You know, these economists,,they love money, they want more and more of it, they want it to grow.,So they calculate the percent annual growth rate of [the] economy.,We in public health, we hate child death,,so we want less and less and less of child deaths.,So we calculate the percent reduction per year,,but it's sort of the same percentage.,If your economy grows with four percent,,you ought to reduce child mortality four percent;,if it's used well and people are really involved,and can get the use of the resources in the way they want it.,So is this fair now to measure this over 19 years?,An economist would never do that.,I have just divided it into two periods.,In the 90s, only 1.2 percent,,only 1.2 percent.,Whereas now, second gear --,it's like Africa had first gear,,now they go into second gear.,But even this,is not a fair representation of Africa,,because it's an average,,it's an average speed of reduction in Africa. 
 And look here when I take you into my bubble graphs.,Still here,,child death per 1,000 on that axis.,Here we have [the] year.,And I'm now giving you a wider picture than the MDG.,I start 50 years ago,when Africa celebrated independence in most countries.,I give you Congo, which was high,,Ghana -- lower. And Kenya -- even lower.,And what has happened over the years since then? Here we go.,You can see, with independence, literacy improved,and vaccinations started, smallpox was eradicated,,hygiene was improved, and things got better.,But then, in the '80s, watch out here.,Congo got into civil war,,and they leveled off here.,Ghana got very ahead, fast.,This was the backlash in Kenya, and Ghana bypassed,,but then Kenya and Ghana go down together --,still a standstill in Congo.,That's where we are today.,You can see it doesn't make sense,to make an average of this zero improvement,and this very fast improvement.,Time has come,to stop thinking about sub-Saharan Africa as one place.,Their countries are so different,,and they merit to be recognized in the same way,,as we don't talk about Europe as one place.,I can tell you that the economy in Greece and Sweden are very different --,everyone knows that.,And they are judged, each country, on how they are doing. 
 So let me show the wider picture.,My country, Sweden:,1800, we were up there.,What a strange personality disorder we must have,,counting the children so meticulously in spite of a high child death rate.,It's very strange. It's sort of embarrassing.,But we had that habit in Sweden, you know,,that we counted all the child deaths,,even if we didn't do anything about it.,And then, you see, these were famine years.,These were bad years, and people got fed up with Sweden.,My ancestors moved to the United States.,And eventually, soon they started to get better and better here.,And here we got better education, and we got health service,,and child mortality came down.,We never had a war; Sweden was in peace all this time.,But look, the rate of lowering,in Sweden,was not fast.,Sweden achieved a low child mortality,because we started early.,We had primary school actually,started in 1842.,And then you get that wonderful effect,when we got female literacy,one generation later.,You have to realize that the investments we do in progress,are long-term investments.,It's not about just five years --,it's long-term investments.,And Sweden never reached [the] Millennium Development Goal rate,,3.1 percent when I calculated.,So we are off track -- that's what Sweden is.,But you don't talk about it so much.,We want others to be better than we were, and indeed, others have been better. 
 Let me show you Thailand,,see what a success story, Thailand from the 1960s --,how they went down here,and reached almost the same child mortality levels as Sweden.,And I'll give you another story -- Egypt,,the most hidden, glorious success in public health.,Egypt was up here in 1960,,higher than Congo.,The Nile Delta was a misery for children,with diarrheal disease,and malaria and a lot of problems.,And then they got the Aswan Dam. They got electricity in their homes,,they increased education,and they got primary health care.,And down they went, you know.,And they got safer water, they eradicated malaria.,And isn't it a success story.,Millennium Development Goal rates for child mortality,is fully possible.,And the good thing is,that Ghana today is going with the same rate,as Egypt did at its fastest.,Kenya is now speeding up.,Here we have a problem.,We have a severe problem in countries which are at a standstill. 
 Now, let me now bring you to a wider picture,,a wider picture of child mortality.,I'm going to show you the relationship,between child mortality on this axis here --,this axis here is child mortality --,and here I have the family size.,The relationship between child mortality and family size.,One, two, three, four children per woman:,six, seven, eight children per woman.,This is, once again, 1960 --,50 years ago.,Each bubble is a country --,the color, you can see, a continent.,The dark blue here is sub-Saharan Africa.,And the size of the bubble is the population.,And these are,the so-called "developing" countries.,They had high, or very high, child mortality,and family size, six to eight.,And the ones over there,,they were so-called Western countries.,They had low child mortality,and small families.,What has happened?,What I want you [to do] now is to see with your own eyes,the relation between fall in child mortality,and decrease in family size.,I just want not to have any room for doubt --,you have to see that for yourself.,This is what happened. Now I start the world.,Here we come down with the eradication of,smallpox, better education,,health service.,It got down there -- China comes into the Western box here.,And here Brazil is in the Western Box.,India is approaching. The first African countries coming into the Western box,,and we get a lot a new neighbors.,Welcome to a decent life.,Come on. We want everyone down there.,This is the vision we have, isn't it.,And look now, the first African countries here are coming in.,There we are today. 
 There is no such thing,as a "Western world" and "developing world.",This is the report from [the] U.N.,,which came out on Friday.,It's very good -- "Levels and Trends in Child Mortality" --,except this page.,This page is very bad;,it's a categorization of countries.,It labels "developing countries," -- I can read from the list here --,developing countries: Republic of Korea -- South Korea.,Huh?,They get Samsung, how can they be [a] developing country?,They have here Singapore.,They have the lowest child mortality in the world, Singapore.,They bypassed Sweden five years ago,,and they are labeled a developing country.,They have here Qatar.,It's the richest country in the world with Al Jazeera.,How the heck could they be [a] developing country?,This is crap.,(Applause),The rest here is good -- the rest is good. 
 We have to have a modern concept,,which fits to the data.,And we have to realize,that we are all going to into this, down to here.,What is the importance now with the relations here.,Look -- even if we look in Africa --,these are the African countries.,You can clearly see the relation with falling child mortality,and decreasing family size,,even within Africa.,It's very clear that this is what happens.,And a very important piece of research came out on Friday,from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle,showing that almost 50 percent,of the fall in child mortality,can be attributed to female education.,That is, when we get girls in school,,we'll get an impact 15 to 20 years later,,which is a secular trend which is very strong.,That's why we must have that long-term perspective,,but we must measure the impact,over 10-year periods.,It's fully possible,to get child mortality down in all of these countries,and to get them down in the corner,where we all would like to live together. 
 And of course, lowering child mortality,is a matter of utmost importance,from humanitarian aspects.,It's a decent life for children,,we are talking about.,But it is also a strategic investment,in the future of all mankind,,because it's about the environment.,We will not be able to manage the environment,and avoid the terrible climate crisis,if we don't stabilize the world population.,Let's be clear about that.,And the way to do that,,that is to get child mortality down, get access to family planning,and behind that drive female education.,And that is fully possible. Let's do it. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Welcome to Thailand.,Now, when I was a young man -- 40 years ago,,the country was very, very poor,with lots and lots and lots of people living in poverty.,We decided to do something about it,,but we didn't begin with a welfare program,or a poverty reduction program.,But we began with a family-planning program,,following a very successful,maternal child health activity,,sets of activities.,So basically, no one would accept family planning,if their children didn't survive.,So the first step: get to the children, get to the mothers,,and then follow up with family planning.,Not just child mortality alone, you need also family planning.,Now let me take you back,as to why we needed to do it. 
 In my country, that was the case in 1974.,Seven children per family --,tremendous growth at 3.3 percent.,There was just no future.,We needed to reduce the population growth rate.,So we said, "Let's do it.",The women said, "We agree. We'll use pills,,but we need a doctor to prescribe the pills,",and we had very, very few doctors.,We didn't take no as an answer;,we took no as a question.,We went to the nurses and the midwives, who were also women,,and did a fantastic job,at explaining how to use the pill.,That was wonderful,,but it covered only 20 percent of the country. 
 What do we do for the other 80 percent --,leave them alone and say, "Well, they're not medical personnel.",No, we decided to do a bit more.,So we went to the ordinary people that you saw.,Actually, below that yellow sign --,I wish they hadn't wiped that,,because there was "Coca-Cola" there.,We were so much bigger than Coca-Cola in those days.,And no difference,,the people they chose were the people we chose.,They were well-known in the community,,they knew that customers were always right,,and they were terrific, and they practiced their family planning themselves.,So they could supply pills and condoms,throughout the country, in every village of the country.,So there we are. We went to the people,who were seen as the cause of the problem,to be the solution.,Wherever there were people --,and you can see boats with the women, selling things --,here's the floating market,selling bananas and crabs,and also contraceptives --,wherever you find people,,you'll find contraceptives in Thailand. 
 And then we decided, why not get to religion,because in the Philippines,,the Catholic Church was pretty strong,,and Thai people were Buddhist.,We went to them and they said, "Look, could you help us?",I'm there -- the one in blue, not the yellow --,holding a bowl of holy water,for the monk to sprinkle holy water,on pills and condoms,for the sanctity of the family.,And this picture was sent throughout the country.,So some of the monks in the villages were doing the same thing themselves.,And the women were saying, "No wonder we have no side-effects.,It's been blessed.",That was their perception. 
 And then we went to teachers.,You need everybody to be involved,in trying to provide whatever it is,that make humanity a better place.,So we went to the teachers.,Over a quarter of a million were taught about family planning,with a new alphabet -- A, B for birth, C for condom,,I for IUD, V for vasectomy.,And then we had a snakes and ladders game, where you throw dice.,If you land on anything pro-family planning, you move ahead.,Like, "Mother takes the pill every night.,Very good, mother. Move ahead.,Uncle buys a condom. Very good, uncle. Move ahead.,Uncle gets drunk, doesn't use condom. Come back, start again.",(Laughter),Again, education, class entertainment.,And the kids were doing it in school too.,We had relay races with condoms,,we had children's condom-blowing championship.,And before long,,the condom was know as the girl's best friend.,In Thailand, for poor people, diamonds don't make it --,so the condom is the girl's best friend. 
 We introduced our first microcredit program in 1975,,and the women who organized it said,,"We only want to lend,to women who practice family planning.,If you're pregnant, take care of your pregnancy.,If you're not pregnant, you can take a loan out from us.",And that was run by them.,And after 35/36 years,,it's still going on.,It's a part of the Village Development Bank;,it's not a real bank, but it's a fund -- microcredit.,And we didn't need a big organization to run it --,it was run by the villagers themselves.,And you probably hardly see a Thai man there,,it's always women, women, women, women.,And then we thought we'd help America,,because America's been helping everyone,,whether they want help or not.,(Laughter),And this is on the Fourth of July.,We decided to provide vasectomy to all men,,but in particular, American men to the front of the queue,,right up to the Ambassador's residence,during his [unclear].,And the hotel gave us the ballroom for it --,very appropriate room.,(Laughter),And since it was near lunch time,,they said, "All right, we'll give you some lunch.,Of course, it must be American cola.,You get two brands, Coke and Pepsi.,And then the food is either hamburger or hotdog.",And I thought a hotdog will be more symbolic.,(Laughter),And here is this, then, young man called Willy Bohm,who worked for the USAID.,Obviously, he's had his vasectomy,because his hotdog is half eaten, and he was very happy.,It made a lot of news in America, and it angered some people also.,I said, "Don't worry. Come over and I'll do the whole lot of you." 
 (Laughter) 
 And what happened?,In all this thing,,from seven children to 1.5 children,,population growth rate of 3.3 to 0.5.,You could call it the Coca-Cola approach if you like --,it was exactly the same thing.,I'm not sure whether Coca-Cola followed us, or we followed Coca-Cola,,but we're good friends.,And so that's the case of everyone joining in.,We didn't have a strong government. We didn't have lots of doctors.,But it's everybody's job,who can change attitude and behavior. 
 Then AIDS came along and hit Thailand,,and we had to stop doing a lot of good things,to fight AIDS.,But unfortunately, the government was in denial, denial, denial.,So our work wasn't affected.,So I thought, "Well, if you can't go to the government, go to the military.",So I went to the military,and asked to borrow 300 radio stations.,They have more than the government,,and they've got more guns than the government.,So I asked them, could they help us,in our fight against HIV.,And after I gave them statistics,,they said, "Yes. Okay. You can use all the radio stations, television stations.",And that's when we went onto the airwaves.,And then we got a new prime minister soon after that.,And he said, "Mechai, could you come and join?",He asked me in because he liked my wife a lot.,So I said, "Okay.",He became the chairman of the National AIDS Committee,and increased the budget fifty-fold. 
 Every ministry, even judges, had to be involved in AIDS education --,everyone -- and we said the public, institutions,,religious institutions, schools --,everyone was involved.,And here, every media person,had to be trained for HIV.,And we gave every station half a minute extra,for advertising to earn more money.,So they were happy with that.,And then AIDS education in all schools,,starting from university.,And these are high school kids teaching high school kids.,And the best teachers were the girls, not the boys,,and they were terrific.,And these girls who go around teaching about safe sex and HIV,were known as Mother Theresa.,And then we went down one more step.,These are primary school kids -- third, fourth grade --,going to every household in the village,,every household in the whole of Thailand,,giving AIDS information and a condom,to every household,,given by these young kids.,And no parents objected, because we were trying to save lives,,and this was a lifesaver.,And we said, "Everyone needs to be involved." 
 So you have the companies also realizing,that sick staff don't work, and dead customers don't buy.,So they all trained.,And then we have this Captain Condom,,with his Harvard MBA,,going to schools and night spots.,And they loved him. You need a symbol of something.,In every country, every program, you need a symbol,,and this is probably the best thing he's ever done with his MBA.,(Laughter),And then we gave condoms out everywhere on the streets --,everywhere, everywhere.,In taxis, you get condoms.,And also, in traffic,,the policemen give you condoms -- our "cops and rubbers" programs.,(Laughter),So, can you imagine New York policemen giving out condoms?,Of course I can. And they'd enjoy it immensely;,I see them standing around right now, everywhere.,Imagine if they had condoms,,giving out to all sorts of people.,And then, new change,,we had hair bands, clothing,and the condom for your mobile phone,during the rainy season. 
 (Laughter) 
 And these were the condoms that we introduced.,One says, "Weapon of mass protection.",We found --,you know -- somebody here was searching for the weapon of mass destruction,,but we have found the weapon of mass protection: the condom.,And then it says here, with the American flag,,"Don't leave home without it.",But I have some to give out afterward.,But let me warn you, these are Thai-sized,,so be very careful.,(Laughter),And so you can see,that condoms can do so many things.,Look at this --,I gave this to Al Gore and to Bill Senior also.,Stop global warming; use condoms.,And then this is the picture I mentioned to you --,the weapon of mass protection.,And let the next Olympics save some lives.,Why just run around?,(Laughter),And then finally,,in Thailand we're Buddhist, we don't have a God,,so instead, we say, "In rubber we trust.",(Laughter),So you can see that we added everything to our endeavor,to make life better for the people.,We had condoms in all the refrigerators in the hotels and the schools,,because alcohol impairs judgment. 
 And then what happened?,After all this time, everybody joined in.,According to the U.N.,,new cases of HIV,declined by 90 percent,,and according to the World Bank,,7.7 million lives were saved.,Otherwise there wouldn't be many Thais walking around today.,So it just showed you, you could do something about it.,90 percent of the funding came from Thailand.,There was political commitment, some financial commitment,,and everybody joined in the fight.,So just don't leave it to the specialists and doctors and nurses.,We all need to help. 
 And then we decided to help people out of poverty,,now that we got AIDS somewhat out of the way --,this time, not with government alone,,but in cooperation with the business community.,Because poor people are business people,who lack business skills and access to credit.,Those are the things to be provided by the business community.,We're trying to turn them into barefoot entrepreneurs,,little business people.,The only way out of poverty is through business enterprise.,So, that was done.,The money goes from the company into the village,via tree-planting.,It's not a free gift.,They plant the trees, and the money goes into their microcredit fund,,which we call the Village Development Bank.,Everybody joins in,,and they feel they own the bank,,because they have brought the money in. 
 And before you can borrow the money, you need to be trained.,And we believe if you want to help the poor,,those who are living in poverty,,access to credit must be a human right.,Access to credit must be a human right.,Otherwise they'll never get out of poverty.,And then before getting a loan, you must be trained.,Here's what we call a "barefoot MBA,",teaching people how to do business,so that, when they borrow money, they'll succeed with the business.,These are some of the businesses:,mushrooms, crabs, vegetables,,trees, fruits,,and this is very interesting -- Nike ice cream and Nike biscuits;,this is a village sponsored by Nike.,They said, "They should stop making shoes and clothes.,Make these better, because we can afford them.",And then we have silk, Thai silk.,Now we're making Scottish tartans, as you can see on the left,,to sell to all people of Scottish ancestors.,So anyone sitting in and watching TV,,get in touch with me.,And then this is our answer to Starbucks in Thailand --,"Coffee and Condoms.",See, Starbucks you awake, we keep you awake and alive.,That's the difference.,Can you imagine, at every Starbucks,that you can also get condoms?,You can order your condoms with your with your cappuccino. 
 And then now, finally in education,,we want to change the school as being underutilized,into a place where it's a lifelong learning center for everyone.,We call this our School-Based Integrated Rural Development.,And it's a center, a focal point,for economic and social development.,Re-do the school,,make it serve the community needs.,And here is a bamboo building --,all of them are bamboo.,This is a geodesic dome made of bamboo.,And I'm sure Buckminster Fuller would be very, very proud,to see a bamboo geodesic dome.,And we use vegetables around the school ground,,so they raise their own vegetables. 
 And then, finally, I firmly believe,,if we want the MDGs to work --,the Millennium Development Goals --,we need to add family planning to it.,Of course, child mortality first and then family planning --,everyone needs family planning service --,it's underutilized.,So we have now found the weapon of mass protection.,And we also ask the next Olympics,to be involved in saving lives.,And then, finally, that is our network.,And these are our Thai tulips. 
 (Laughter) 
 Thank you very much indeed. 
 (Applause)One of my favorite parts,of my job at the Gates Foundation,is that I get to travel to the developing world,,and I do that quite regularly.,And when I meet the mothers,in so many of these remote places,,I'm really struck by the things,that we have in common.,They want what we want for our children,and that is for their children to grow up successful,,to be healthy, and to have a successful life.,But I also see lots of poverty,,and it's quite jarring,,both in the scale and the scope of it.,My first trip in India, I was in a person's home,where they had dirt floors, no running water,,no electricity,,and that's really what I see all over the world.,So in short, I'm startled by all the things,that they don't have.,But I am surprised by one thing that they do have:,Coca-Cola. 
 Coke is everywhere.,In fact, when I travel to the developing world,,Coke feels ubiquitous.,And so when I come back from these trips,,and I'm thinking about development,,and I'm flying home and I'm thinking,,"We're trying to deliver condoms to people or vaccinations,",you know, Coke's success kind of stops and makes you wonder:,how is it that they can get Coke,to these far-flung places?,If they can do that,,why can't governments and NGOs do the same thing?,And I'm not the first person to ask this question.,But I think, as a community,,we still have a lot to learn.,It's staggering, if you think about Coca-Cola.,They sell 1.5 billion servings,every single day.,That's like every man, woman and child on the planet,having a serving of Coke every week.,So why does this matter?,Well, if we're going to speed up the progress,and go even faster,on the set of Millennium Development Goals that we're set as a world,,we need to learn from the innovators,,and those innovators,come from every single sector.,I feel that, if we can understand,what makes something like Coca-Cola ubiquitous,,we can apply those lessons then for the public good. 
 Coke's success is relevant,,because if we can analyze it, learn from it,,then we can save lives.,So that's why I took a bit of time to study Coke.,And I think there are really three things,we can take away from Coca-Cola.,They take real-time data,and immediately feed it back into the product.,They tap into local entrepreneurial talent,,and they do incredible marketing.,So let's start with the data.,Now Coke has a very clear bottom line --,they report to a set of shareholders, they have to turn a profit.,So they take the data,,and they use it to measure progress.,They have this very continuous feedback loop.,They learn something, they put it back into the product,,they put it back into the market.,They have a whole team called "Knowledge and Insight.",It's a lot like other consumer companies.,So if you're running Namibia for Coca-Cola,,and you have a 107 constituencies,,you know where every can versus bottle,of Sprite, Fanta or Coke was sold,,whether it was a corner store,,a supermarket or a pushcart.,So if sales start to drop,,then the person can identify the problem,and address the issue. 
 Let's contrast that for a minute to development.,In development, the evaluation comes,at the very end of the project.,I've sat in a lot of those meetings,,and by then,,it is way too late to use the data.,I had somebody from an NGO,once describe it to me as bowling in the dark.,They said, "You roll the ball, you hear some pins go down.,It's dark, you can't see which one goes down until the lights come on,,and then you an see your impact.",Real-time data,turns on the lights. 
 So what's the second thing that Coke's good at?,They're good at tapping into,that local entrepreneurial talent.,Coke's been in Africa since 1928,,but most of the time they couldn't reach the distant markets,,because they had a system that was a lot like in the developed world,,which was a large truck rolling down the street.,And in Africa, the remote places,,it's hard to find a good road.,But Coke noticed something --,they noticed that local people were taking the product, buying it in bulk,and then reselling it in these hard-to-reach places.,And so they took a bit of time to learn about that.,And they decided in 1990,that they wanted to start training the local entrepreneurs,,giving them small loans.,They set them up as what they called micro-distribution centers,,and those local entrepreneurs then hire sales people,,who go out with bicycles and pushcarts and wheelbarrows,to sell the product.,There are now some 3,000 of these centers,employing about 15,000 people in Africa.,In Tanzania and Uganda,,they represent 90 percent,of Coke's sales.,Let's look at the development side. 
 What is it that governments and NGOs,can learn from Coke?,Governments and NGOs,need to tap into that local entrepreneurial talent as well,,because the locals know how to reach,the very hard-to-serve places, their neighbors,,and they know what motivates them to make change.,I think a great example of this,is Ethiopia's new health extension program.,The government noticed in Ethiopia,that many of the people were so far away from a health clinic,,they were over a day's travel away from a health clinic.,So if you're in an emergency situation -- or if you're a mom about to deliver a baby --,forget it, to get to the health care center.,They decided that wasn't good enough,,so they went to India and studied the Indian state of Kerala,that also had a system like this,,and they adapted it for Ethiopia.,And in 2003, the government of Ethiopia,started this new system in their own country.,They trained 35,000 health extension workers,to deliver care directly to the people.,In just five years,,their ratio went from one worker for every 30,000 people,to one worker for every 2,500 people. 
 Now, think about,how this can change people's lives.,Health extension workers can help with so many things,,whether it's family planning, prenatal care,,immunizations for the children,,or advising the woman to get to the facility on time,for an on-time delivery.,That is having real impact,in a country like Ethiopia,,and it's why you see their child mortality numbers,coming down 25 percent,from 2000 to 2008.,In Ethiopia, there are hundreds of thousands of children living,because of this health extension worker program.,So what's the next step for Ethiopia?,Well, they're already starting talk about this.,They're starting to talk about, "How do you have the health community workers,generate their own ideas?,How do you incent them based on the impact that they're getting,out in those remote villages?",That's how you tap into local entrepreneurial talent,and you unlock people's potential. 
 The third component of Coke's success,is marketing.,Ultimately, Coke's success,depends on one crucial fact,and that is that people want,a Coca-Cola.,Now the reason these micro-entrepreneurs,can sell or make a profit,is they have to sell every single bottle in their pushcart or their wheelbarrow.,So, they rely on Coca-Cola,in terms of its marketing,,and what's the secret to their marketing?,Well, it's aspirational.,It is associated that product,with a kind of life that people want to live.,So even though it's a global company,,they take a very local approach.,Coke's global campaign slogan,is "Open Happiness.",But they localize it.,And they don't just guess what makes people happy;,they go to places like Latin America,and they realize that happiness there,is associated with family life.,And in South Africa,,they associate happiness,with seriti or community respect.,Now, that played itself out in the World Cup campaign.,Let's listen to this song that Coke created for it,,"Wavin' Flag" by a Somali hip hop artist. 
 (Video) K'Naan: ♫ Oh oh oh oh oh o-oh ♫,♫ Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ♫,♫ Oh oh oh oh oh o-oh ♫,♫ Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh o-oh ♫,♫Give you freedom, give you fire♫,♫ Give you reason, take you higher ♫,♫ See the champions take the field now ♫,♫ You define us, make us feel proud ♫,♫ In the streets our heads are lifted ♫,♫ As we lose our inhibition ♫,♫ Celebration, it's around us ♫,♫ Every nation, all around us ♫ 
 Melinda French Gates: It feels pretty good, right?,Well, they didn't stop there --,they localized it into 18 different languages.,And it went number one on the pop chart,in 17 countries.,It reminds me of a song that I remember from my childhood,,"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing,",that also went number one on the pop charts.,Both songs have something in common:,that same appeal,of celebration and unity.,So how does health and development market?,Well, it's based on avoidance,,not aspirations.,I'm sure you've heard some of these messages.,"Use a condom, don't get AIDS.","Wash you hands, you might not get diarrhea.",It doesn't sound anything like "Wavin' Flag" to me. 
 And I think we make a fundamental mistake --,we make an assumption,,that we think that, if people need something,,we don't have to make them want that.,And I think that's a mistake.,And there's some indications around the world that this is starting to change.,One example is sanitation.,We know that a million and a half children,die a year from diarrhea,and a lot of it is because of open defecation.,But there's a solution: you build a toilet.,But what we're finding around the world, over and over again,,is, if you build a toilet and you leave it there,,it doesn't get used.,People reuse it for a slab for their home.,They sometimes store grain in it.,I've even seen it used for a chicken coop.,(Laughter),But what does marketing really entail,that would make a sanitation solution get a result in diarrhea?,Well, you work with the community.,You start to talk to them about why open defecation,is something that shouldn't be done in the village,,and they agree to that.,But then you take the toilet and you position it,as a modern, trendy convenience.,One state in Northern India has gone so far,as to link toilets to courtship.,And it works -- look at these headlines.,(Laughter),I'm not kidding.,Women are refusing to marry men without toilets.,No loo, no "I do." 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, it's not just a funny headline --,it's innovative. It's an innovative marketing campaign.,But more importantly,,it saves lives.,Take a look at this --,this is a room full of young men,and my husband, Bill.,And can you guess what the young men are waiting for?,They're waiting to be circumcised.,Can you you believe that?,We know that circumcision reduces HIV infection,by 60 percent in men.,And when we first heard this result inside the Foundation,,I have to admit, Bill and I were scratching our heads a little bit,and we were saying, "But who's going to volunteer for this procedure?",But it turns out the men do,,because they're hearing from their girlfriends,that they prefer it,,and the men also believe it improves their sex life.,So if we can start to understand,what people really want,in health and development,,we can change communities,and we can change whole nations. 
 Well, why is all of this so important?,So let's talk about what happens when this all comes together,,when you tie the three things together.,And polio, I think, is one of the most powerful examples.,We've seen a 99 percent reduction in polio in 20 years.,So if you look back to 1988,,there are about 350,000 cases of polio,on the planet that year.,In 2009, we're down to 1,600 cases.,Well how did that happen?,Let's look at a country like India.,They have over a billion people in this country,,but they have 35,000 local doctors,who report paralysis,,and clinicians, a huge reporting system in chemists.,They have two and a half million vaccinators.,But let me make the story a little bit more concrete for you.,Let me tell you the story of Shriram,,an 18 month boy in Bihar,,a northern state in India.,This year on August 8th, he felt paralysis,and on the 13th, his parents took him to the doctor.,On August 14th and 15th, they took a stool sample,,and by the 25th of August,,it was confirmed he had Type 1 polio.,By August 30th, a genetic test was done,,and we knew what strain of polio Shriram had. 
 Now it could have come from one of two places.,It could have come from Nepal, just to the north, across the border,,or from Jharkhand, a state just to the south.,Luckily, the genetic testing proved,that, in fact, this strand came north,,because, had it come from the south,,it would have had a much wider impact in terms of transmission.,So many more people would have been affected.,So what's the endgame?,Well on September 4th, there was a huge mop-up campaign,,which is what you do in polio.,They went out and where Shriram lives,,they vaccinated two million people.,So in less than a month,,we went from one case of paralysis,to a targeted vaccination program.,And I'm happy to say only one other person in that area got polio.,That's how you keep,a huge outbreak from spreading,,and it shows what can happen,when local people have the data in their hands;,they can save lives. 
 Now one of the challenges in polio, still, is marketing,,but it might not be what you think.,It's not the marketing on the ground.,It's not telling the parents,,"If you see paralysis, take your child to the doctor,or get your child vaccinated.",We have a problem with marketing in the donor community.,The G8 nations have been incredibly generous on polio,over the last 20 years,,but we're starting to have something called polio fatigue,and that is that the donor nations,aren't willing to fund polio any longer.,So by next summer, we're sighted to run out of money on polio.,So we are 99 percent,of the way there on this goal,and we're about to run short of money.,And I think that if the marketing were more aspirational,,if we could focus as a community,on how far we've come,and how amazing it would be,to eradicate this disease,,we could put polio fatigue,and polio behind us.,And if we could do that,,we could stop vaccinating everybody, worldwide,,in all of our countries for polio.,And it would only be the second disease ever,wiped off the face of the planet.,And we are so close.,And this victory is so possible. 
 So if Coke's marketers came to me,and asked me to define happiness,,I'd say my vision of happiness,is a mother holding healthy baby,in her arms.,To me, that is deep happiness.,And so if we can learn lessons from the innovators in every sector,,then in the future we make together,,that happiness,can be just as ubiquitous,as Coca-Cola. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I wanted to just startnby asking everyone a question:,How many of you are completely comfortable,with calling yourselves a leader?,I've asked that questionnall across the country,,and everywhere I ask it, no matter where,,there's a huge portion of the audiencenthat won't put up their hand.,And I've come to realizenthat we have made leadership,into something bigger than us;nsomething beyond us.,We've made it about changing the world.,We've taken this title of "leader",and treat it as somethingnthat one day we're going to deserve.,But to give it to ourselves right now,means a level of arrogance or cockinessnthat we're not comfortable with.,And I worry sometimesnthat we spend so much time,celebrating amazing thingsnthat hardly anybody can do,,that we've convinced ourselves thosenare the only things worth celebrating.,We start to devalue the thingsnwe can do every day,,We take momentsnwhere we truly are a leader,and we don't let ourselves take creditnfor it, or feel good about it.,I've been lucky enoughnover the last 10 years,to work with amazing peoplenwho've helped me redefine leadership,in a way that I think has made me happier.,With my short time today,,I want to share with you the one storynthat is probably most responsible,for that redefinition. 
 I went to a little school,called Mount Allison Universitynin Sackville, New Brunswick.,And on my last day there,na girl came up to me and said,,"I remember the first time I met you.",And she told me a storynthat had happened four years earlier.,She said, "On the daynbefore I started university,,I was in the hotel roomnwith my mom and dad,,and I was so scarednand so convinced that I couldn't do this,,that I wasn't ready for university,nthat I just burst into tears.,My mom and dad were amazing.,They were like, "We know you're scared,nbut let's just go tomorrow,,go to the first day, and if at any pointnyou feel as if you can't do this,,that's fine; tell us,nand we'll take you home.,We love you no matter what.'" 
 She says, "So I went the next day.,I was in line for registration,,and I looked around and just knewnI couldn't do it; I wasn't ready.,I knew I had to quit.,I made that decisionnand as soon as I made it,,an incredible feelingnof peace came over me.,I turned to my mom and dadnto tell them we needed to go home,,and at that moment, you camenout of the student union building,wearing the stupidest hatnI've ever seen in my life." 
 (Laughter) 
 "It was awesome.,And you had a big signnpromoting Shinerama," --,which is Students FightingnCystic Fibrosis,,a charity I've worked with for years --,"And you had a bucketful of lollipops.,You were handing the lollipops outnto people in line,,and talking about Shinerama.,All of the sudden, you got to me,nand you just stopped.,And you stared. It was creepy." 
 (Laughter) 
 This girl knows what I'm talking about. 
 (Laughter) 
 "Then you looked at the guy next to me,nsmiled, reached into your bucket,,pulled out a lollipop,nheld it out to him and said,,'You need to give a lollipopnto the beautiful woman next to you.'",She said, "I've never seen anyonenget more embarrassed faster in my life.,He turned beet red,nhe wouldn't even look at me.,He just kind of heldnthe lollipop out like this." 
 (Laughter) 
 "I felt so bad for this dudenthat I took the lollipop.,As soon as I did, you gotnthis incredibly severe look on your face,,looked at my mom and dadnand said, 'Look at that! Look at that!,First day away from home,,and already she's taking candynfrom a stranger?'" 
 (Laughter) 
 She said, "Everybody lost it.,Twenty feet in every direction,neveryone started to howl.,I know this is cheesy, and I don't knownwhy I'm telling you this,,but in that moment when everyonenwas laughing, I knew I shouldn't quit.,I knew I was where I was supposednto be; I knew I was home.,And I haven't spoken to younonce in the four years since that day.,But I heard that you were leaving,nand I had to come and tell you,you've been an incrediblynimportant person in my life.,I'm going to miss you. Good luck." 
 And she walks away, and I'm flattened.,She gets six feet away,nturns around, smiles and goes,,"You should probably know this, too:,I'm still dating that guy,nfour years later." 
 (Laughter) 
 A year and a halfnafter I moved to Toronto,,I got an invitation to their wedding. 
 (Laughter) 
 Here's the kicker: I don't remember that.,I have no recollection of that moment.,I've searched my memory banks,,because that is funny and I shouldnremember doing it and I don't.,That was such an eye-opening,ntransformative moment for me,,to think that maybe the biggest impactnI'd ever had on anyone's life,,a moment that had a woman walk upnto a stranger four years later and say,,"You've been an importantnperson in my life,",was a moment that I didn't even remember. 
 How many of you guysnhave a lollipop moment,,a moment where someonensaid or did something,that you feel fundamentallynmade your life better?,All right. How many of you have toldnthat person they did it?,See, why not?,We celebrate birthdays,,where all you have to donis not die for 365 days -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Yet we let peoplenwho have made our lives better,walk around without knowing it.,Every single one of younhas been the catalyst,for a lollipop moment.,You've made someone's life betternby something you said or did.,If you think you haven't,,think of all the handsnthat didn't go up when I asked.,You're just one of the peoplenwho hasn't been told. 
 It's scary to think of ourselvesnas that powerful,,frightening to think we can matternthat much to other people.,As long as we make leadershipnsomething bigger than us,,as long as we keep leadership beyond us,and make it about changing the world,,we give ourselves an excusennot to expect it every day,,from ourselves and from each other. 
 Marianne Williamson said, "Our greatestnfear is not that we are inadequate.,[It] is that we are powerfulnbeyond measure.,It is our light and not our darknessnthat frightens us.",My call to action todaynis that we need to get over our fear,of how extraordinarily powerfulnwe can be in each other's lives.,We need to get over itnso we can move beyond it,,and our little brothers and sistersnand one day our kids --,or our kids right now --ncan watch and start to value,the impact we can havenon each other's lives,,more than money and powernand titles and influence.,We need to redefine leadershipnas being about lollipop moments --,how many of them we create,nhow many we acknowledge,,how many of them we pay forwardnand how many we say thank you for.,Because we've made leadershipnabout changing the world,,and there is no world.,There's only six billionnunderstandings of it. 
 And if you changenone person's understanding of it,,understanding of what they're capable of,,understanding of how muchnpeople care about them,,understanding of how powerfulnan agent for change,they can be in this world,,you've changed the whole thing. 
 And if we can understandnleadership like that,,I think if we can redefinenleadership like that,,I think we can change everything.,And it's a simple idea,nbut I don't think it's a small one.,I want to thank you so muchnfor letting me share it with you today.So the Awesome story:,It begins about 40 years ago,,when my mom and my dad came to Canada.,My mom left Nairobi, Kenya.,My dad left a small village outside of Amritsar, India.,And they got here in the late 1960s.,They settled in a shady suburb about an hour east of Toronto,,and they settled into a new life.,They saw their first dentist,,they ate their first hamburger,,and they had their first kids.,My sister and I,grew up here,,and we had quiet, happy childhoods.,We had close family,,good friends, a quiet street.,We grew up taking for granted,a lot of the things that my parents couldn't take for granted,when they grew up --,things like power always on,in our houses,,things like schools across the street,and hospitals down the road,and popsicles in the backyard.,We grew up, and we grew older.,I went to high school.,I graduated.,I moved out of the house, I got a job,,I found a girl, I settled down --,and I realize it sounds like a bad sitcom or a Cat Stevens' song -- 
 (Laughter) 
 but life was pretty good.,Life was pretty good.,2006 was a great year.,Under clear blue skies in July in the wine region of Ontario,,I got married,,surrounded by 150 family and friends.,2007 was a great year.,I graduated from school,,and I went on a road trip with two of my closest friends.,Here's a picture of me and my friend, Chris,,on the coast of the Pacific Ocean.,We actually saw seals out of our car window,,and we pulled over to take a quick picture of them,and then blocked them with our giant heads.,(Laughter),So you can't actually see them,,but it was breathtaking,,believe me. 
 (Laughter) 
 2008 and 2009 were a little tougher.,I know that they were tougher for a lot of people,,not just me.,First of all, the news was so heavy.,It's still heavy now, and it was heavy before that,,but when you flipped open a newspaper, when you turned on the TV,,it was about ice caps melting,,wars going on around the world,,earthquakes, hurricanes,and an economy that was wobbling on the brink of collapse,,and then eventually did collapse,,and so many of us losing our homes,,or our jobs,,or our retirements,,or our livelihoods.,2008, 2009 were heavy years for me for another reason, too.,I was going through a lot of personal problems at the time.,My marriage wasn't going well,,and we just were growing further and further apart.,One day my wife came home from work,and summoned the courage, through a lot of tears,,to have a very honest conversation.,And she said, "I don't love you anymore,",and it was one of the most painful things I'd ever heard,and certainly the most heartbreaking thing I'd ever heard,,until only a month later,,when I heard something even more heartbreaking. 
 My friend Chris, who I just showed you a picture of,,had been battling mental illness for some time.,And for those of you,whose lives have been touched by mental illness,,you know how challenging it can be.,I spoke to him on the phone at 10:30 p.m.,on a Sunday night.,We talked about the TV show we watched that evening.,And Monday morning, I found out that he disappeared.,Very sadly, he took his own life.,And it was a really heavy time. 
 And as these dark clouds were circling me,,and I was finding it really, really difficult,to think of anything good,,I said to myself that I really needed a way,to focus on the positive somehow.,So I came home from work one night,,and I logged onto the computer,,and I started up a tiny website,called 1000awesomethings.com.,I was trying to remind myself,of the simple, universal, little pleasures that we all love,,but we just don't talk about enough --,things like waiters and waitresses,who bring you free refills without asking,,being the first table to get called up,to the dinner buffet at a wedding,,wearing warm underwear from just out of the dryer,,or when cashiers open up a new check-out lane at the grocery store,and you get to be first in line --,even if you were last at the other line, swoop right in there. 
 (Laughter) 
 And slowly over time,,I started putting myself in a better mood.,I mean, 50,000 blogs,are started a day,,and so my blog was just one of those 50,000.,And nobody read it except for my mom.,Although I should say that my traffic did skyrocket,and go up by 100 percent,when she forwarded it to my dad.,(Laughter),And then I got excited,when it started getting tens of hits,,and then I started getting excited when it started getting dozens,and then hundreds and then thousands,and then millions.,It started getting bigger and bigger and bigger.,And then I got a phone call,,and the voice at the other end of the line said,,"You've just won the Best Blog In the World award.",I was like, that sounds totally fake.,(Laughter),(Applause),Which African country do you want me to wire all my money to?,(Laughter),But it turns out, I jumped on a plane,,and I ended up walking a red carpet,between Sarah Silverman and Jimmy Fallon and Martha Stewart.,And I went onstage to accept a Webby award for Best Blog.,And the surprise,and just the amazement of that,was only overshadowed by my return to Toronto,,when, in my inbox,,10 literary agents were waiting for me,to talk about putting this into a book.,Flash-forward to the next year,and "The Book of Awesome" has now been,number one on the bestseller list for 20 straight weeks. 
 (Applause) 
 But look, I said I wanted to do three things with you today.,I said I wanted to tell you the Awesome story,,I wanted to share with you the three As of Awesome,,and I wanted to leave you with a closing thought.,So let's talk about those three As.,Over the last few years,,I haven't had that much time to really think.,But lately I have had the opportunity to take a step back,and ask myself: "What is it over the last few years,that helped me grow my website,,but also grow myself?",And I've summarized those things, for me personally,,as three As.,They are Attitude, Awareness,and Authenticity.,I'd love to just talk about each one briefly. 
 So Attitude:,Look, we're all going to get lumps,,and we're all going to get bumps.,None of us can predict the future, but we do know one thing about it,and that's that it ain't gonna go according to plan.,We will all have high highs,and big days and proud moments,of smiles on graduation stages,,father-daughter dances at weddings,and healthy babies screeching in the delivery room,,but between those high highs,,we may also have some lumps and some bumps too.,It's sad, and it's not pleasant to talk about,,but your husband might leave you,,your girlfriend could cheat,,your headaches might be more serious than you thought,,or your dog could get hit by a car on the street.,It's not a happy thought,,but your kids could get mixed up in gangs,or bad scenes.,Your mom could get cancer,,your dad could get mean.,And there are times in life,when you will be tossed in the well, too,,with twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart,,and when that bad news washes over you,,and when that pain sponges and soaks in,,I just really hope you feel,like you've always got two choices.,One, you can swirl and twirl,and gloom and doom forever,,or two, you can grieve,and then face the future,with newly sober eyes.,Having a great attitude is about choosing option number two,,and choosing, no matter how difficult it is,,no matter what pain hits you,,choosing to move forward and move on,and take baby steps into the future. 
 The second "A" is Awareness.,I love hanging out with three year-olds.,I love the way that they see the world,,because they're seeing the world for the first time.,I love the way that they can stare at a bug crossing the sidewalk.,I love the way that they'll stare slack-jawed,at their first baseball game,with wide eyes and a mitt on their hand,,soaking in the crack of the bat and the crunch of the peanuts,and the smell of the hotdogs.,I love the way that they'll spend hours picking dandelions in the backyard,and putting them into a nice centerpiece,for Thanksgiving dinner.,I love the way that they see the world,,because they're seeing the world,for the first time.,Having a sense of awareness,is just about embracing your inner three year-old.,Because you all used to be three years old.,That three-year-old boy is still part of you.,That three-year-old girl is still part of you.,They're in there.,And being aware is just about remembering,that you saw everything you've seen,for the first time once, too.,So there was a time when it was your first time ever,hitting a string of green lights on the way home from work.,There was the first time you walked by the open door of a bakery,and smelt the bakery air,,or the first time you pulled a 20-dollar bill out of your old jacket pocket,and said, "Found money." 
 The last "A" is Authenticity.,And for this one, I want to tell you a quick story.,Let's go all the way back to 1932,when, on a peanut farm in Georgia,,a little baby boy named Roosevelt Grier was born.,Roosevelt Grier, or Rosey Grier, as people used to call him,,grew up and grew into,a 300-pound, six-foot-five linebacker in the NFL.,He's number 76 in the picture.,Here he is pictured with the "fearsome foursome.",These were four guys on the L.A. Rams in the 1960s,you did not want to go up against.,They were tough football players doing what they love,,which was crushing skulls,and separating shoulders on the football field.,But Rosey Grier also had,another passion.,In his deeply authentic self,,he also loved needlepoint. (Laughter),He loved knitting.,He said that it calmed him down, it relaxed him,,it took away his fear of flying and helped him meet chicks.,That's what he said.,I mean, he loved it so much that, after he retired from the NFL,,he started joining clubs.,And he even put out a book,called "Rosey Grier's Needlepoint for Men.",(Laughter),(Applause),It's a great cover.,If you notice, he's actually needlepointing his own face. 
 (Laughter) 
 And so what I love about this story,is that Rosey Grier,is just such an authentic person,,and that's what authenticity is all about.,It's just about being you and being cool with that.,And I think when you're authentic,,you end up following your heart,,and you put yourself in places,and situations and in conversations,that you love and that you enjoy.,You meet people that you like talking to.,You go places you've dreamt about.,And you end you end up following your heart,and feeling very fulfilled.,So those are the three A's. 
 For the closing thought, I want to take you all the way back,to my parents coming to Canada.,I don't know what it would feel like,coming to a new country when you're in your mid-20s.,I don't know, because I never did it,,but I would imagine that it would take a great attitude.,I would imagine that you'd have to be pretty aware of your surroundings,and appreciating the small wonders,that you're starting to see in your new world.,And I think you'd have to be really authentic,,you'd have to be really true to yourself,in order to get through what you're being exposed to. 
 I'd like to pause my TEDTalk,for about 10 seconds right now,,because you don't get many opportunities in life to do something like this,,and my parents are sitting in the front row.,So I wanted to ask them to, if they don't mind, stand up.,And I just wanted to say thank you to you guys. 
 (Applause) 
 When I was growing up, my dad used to love telling the story,of his first day in Canada.,And it's a great story, because what happened was,he got off the plane at the Toronto airport,,and he was welcomed by a non-profit group,,which I'm sure someone in this room runs.,(Laughter),And this non-profit group had a big welcoming lunch,for all the new immigrants to Canada.,And my dad says he got off the plane and he went to this lunch,and there was this huge spread.,There was bread, there was those little, mini dill pickles,,there was olives, those little white onions.,There was rolled up turkey cold cuts,,rolled up ham cold cuts, rolled up roast beef cold cuts,and little cubes of cheese.,There was tuna salad sandwiches and egg salad sandwiches,and salmon salad sandwiches.,There was lasagna, there was casseroles,,there was brownies, there was butter tarts,,and there was pies, lots and lots of pies.,And when my dad tells the story, he says,,"The craziest thing was, I'd never seen any of that before, except bread.,(Laughter),I didn't know what was meat, what was vegetarian.,I was eating olives with pie.,(Laughter),I just couldn't believe how many things you can get here." 
 (Laughter) 
 When I was five years old,,my dad used to take me grocery shopping,,and he would stare in wonder,at the little stickers that are on the fruits and vegetables.,He would say, "Look, can you believe they have a mango here from Mexico?,They've got an apple here from South Africa.,Can you believe they've got a date from Morocco?",He's like, "Do you know where Morocco even is?",And I'd say, "I'm five. I don't even know where I am.,Is this A&P?",And he'd say, "I don't know where Morocco is either, but let's find out.",And so we'd buy the date, and we'd go home.,And we'd actually take an atlas off the shelf,,and we'd flip through until we found this mysterious country.,And when we did, my dad would say,,"Can you believe someone climbed a tree over there,,picked this thing off it, put it in a truck,,drove it all the way to the docks,and then sailed it all the way,across the Atlantic Ocean,and then put it in another truck,and drove that all the way to a tiny grocery store just outside our house,,so they could sell it to us for 25 cents?",And I'd say, "I don't believe that.",And he's like, "I don't believe it either.,Things are amazing. There's just so many things to be happy about." 
 When I stop to think about it, he's absolutely right.,There are so many things to be happy about.,We are the only species,on the only life-giving rock,in the entire universe that we've ever seen,,capable of experiencing,so many of these things.,I mean, we're the only ones with architecture and agriculture.,We're the only ones with jewelry and democracy.,We've got airplanes, highway lanes,,interior design and horoscope signs.,We've got fashion magazines, house party scenes.,You can watch a horror movie with monsters.,You can go to a concert and hear guitars jamming.,We've got books, buffets and radio waves,,wedding brides and rollercoaster rides.,You can sleep in clean sheets.,You can go to the movies and get good seats.,You can smell bakery air, walk around with rain hair,,pop bubble wrap or take an illegal nap. 
 We've got all that,,but we've only got 100 years to enjoy it.,And that's the sad part.,The cashiers at your grocery store,,the foreman at your plant,,the guy tailgating you home on the highway,,the telemarketer calling you during dinner,,every teacher you've ever had,,everyone that's ever woken up beside you,,every politician in every country,,every actor in every movie,,every single person in your family, everyone you love,,everyone in this room and you,will be dead in a hundred years.,Life is so great that we only get such a short time,to experience and enjoy,all those tiny little moments that make it so sweet.,And that moment is right now,,and those moments are counting down,,and those moments are always, always, always fleeting. 
 You will never be as young as you are right now.,And that's why I believe that if you live your life,with a great attitude,,choosing to move forward and move on,whenever life deals you a blow,,living with a sense of awareness of the world around you,,embracing your inner three year-old,and seeing the tiny joys that make life so sweet,and being authentic to yourself,,being you and being cool with that,,letting your heart lead you and putting yourself in experiences that satisfy you,,then I think you'll live a life,that is rich and is satisfying,,and I think you'll live a life that is truly awesome. 
 Thank you.My story actually began when I was four years old,and my family moved to a new neighborhood,in our hometown of Savannah, Georgia.,And this was the 1960s,when actually all the streets in this neighborhood,were named after Confederate war generals.,We lived on Robert E. Lee Boulevard.,And when I was five,,my parents gave me an orange Schwinn Sting-Ray bicycle.,It had a swooping banana seat and those ape hanger handlebars,that made the rider look like an orangutan.,That's why they were called ape hangers.,They were actually modeled on hotrod motorcycles of the 1960s,,which I'm sure my mom didn't know.,And one day I was exploring this cul-de-sac,hidden away a few streets away.,And I came back,,and I wanted to turn around and get back to that street more quickly,,so I decided to turn around in this big street,that intersected our neighborhood,,and wham! I was hit by a passing sedan.,My mangled body flew in one direction,,my mangled bike flew in the other.,And I lay on the pavement stretching over that yellow line,,and one of my neighbors came running over.,"Andy, Andy, how are you doing?" she said, using the name of my older brother.,(Laughter),"I'm Bruce," I said, and promptly passed out. 
 I broke my left femur that day --,it's the largest bone in your body --,and spent the next two months in a body cast,that went from my chin to the tip of my toe,to my right knee,,and a steel bar went from my right knee,to my left ankle.,And for the next 38 years,,that accident was the only medically interesting thing,that ever happened to me.,In fact, I made a living by walking.,I traveled around the world, entered different cultures,,wrote a series of books about my travels,,including "Walking the Bible.",I hosted a television show by that name,on PBS.,I was, for all the world, the "walking guy.",Until, in May 2008,,a routine visit to my doctor,and a routine blood test,produced evidence in the form of an alkaline phosphatase number,that something might be wrong with my bones.,And my doctor, on a whim, sent me to get a full-body bone scan,,which showed that there was some growth in my left leg.,That sent me to an X-ray, then to an MRI.,And one afternoon, I got a call from my doctor.,"The tumor in your leg,is not consistent with a benign tumor.",I stopped walking,,and it took my mind a second to convert that double negative,into a much more horrifying negative.,I have cancer.,And to think that the tumor was in the same bone,,in the same place in my body,as the accident 38 years earlier --,it seemed like too much of a coincidence. 
 So that afternoon, I went back to my house,,and my three year-old identical twin daughters, Eden and Tybee Feiler,,came running to meet me.,They'd just turned three,,and they were into all things pink and purple.,In fact, we called them Pinkalicious and Purplicious --,although I must say, our favorite nickname,occurred on their birthday, April 15th.,When they were born at 6:14 and 6:46,on April 15, 2005,,our otherwise grim, humorless doctor looked at his watch,,and was like, "Hmm, April 15th -- tax day.,Early filer and late filer.",(Laughter),The next day I came to see him. I was like, "Doctor, that was a really good joke.",And he was like, "You're the writer, kid.",Anyway -- so they had just turned three,,and they came and they were doing this dance they had just made up,where they were twirling faster and faster until they tumbled to the ground,,laughing with all the glee in the world.,I crumbled.,I kept imagining all the walks I might not take with them,,the art projects I might not mess up,,the boyfriends I might not scowl at,,the aisles I might not walk down.,Would they wonder who I was, I thought.,Would they yearn for my approval,,my love, my voice? 
 A few days later, I woke with an idea,of how I might give them that voice.,I would reach out to six men,from all parts of my life,and ask them to be present,in the passages of my daughters' lives.,"I believe my girls will have plenty of opportunities in their lives,",I wrote these men.,"They'll have loving families and welcoming homes,,but they may not have me.,They may not have their dad.,Will you help be their dad?",And I said to myself,I would call this group of men "the Council of Dads." 
 Now as soon as I had this idea,,I decided I wouldn't tell my wife. Okay.,She's a very upbeat,,naturally excited person.,There's this idea in this culture -- I don't have to tell you --,that you sort of "happy" your way through a problem.,We should focus on the positive.,My wife, as I said, she grew up outside of Boston.,She's got a big smile. She's got a big personality.,She's got big hair --,although, she told me recently, I can't say she has big hair,,because if I say she has big hair,,people will think she's from Texas.,And it's apparently okay to marry a boy from Georgia,,but not to have hair from Texas.,And actually, in her defense, if she were here right now,,she would point out that, when we got married in Georgia,,there were three questions,on the marriage certificate license,,the third of which was, "Are you related?",(Laughter),I said, "Look, in Georgia at least we want to know.,In Arkansas they don't even ask.",What I didn't tell her is, if she said, "Yes," you could jump.,You don't need the 30-day waiting period.,Because you don't need the get-to-know-you session at that point. 
 So I wasn't going to tell her about this idea,,but the next day I couldn't control myself, I told her.,And she loved the idea,,but she quickly started rejecting my nominees.,She was like, "Well, I love him, but I would never ask him for advice.",So it turned out that starting a council of dads,was a very efficient way to find out,what my wife really thought of my friends. 
 (Laughter) 
 So we decided that we needed a set of rules,,and we came up with a number.,And the first one was no family, only friends.,We thought our family would already be there.,Second, men only.,We were trying to fill the dad-space in the girls' lives.,And then third, sort of a dad for every side.,We kind of went through my personality,and tried to get a dad who represented each different thing.,So what happened was I wrote a letter to each of these men.,And rather than send it,,I decided to read it to them in person.,Linda, my wife, joked that it was like having six different marriage proposals.,I sort of friend-married each of these guys. 
 And the first of these guys was Jeff Schumlin.,Now Jeff led this trip I took to Europe,when I graduated from high school in the early 1980s.,And on that first day we were in this youth hostel in a castle.,And I snuck out behind,,and there was a moat, a fence and a field of cows.,And Jeff came up beside me and said,,"So, have you ever been cow tipping?",I was like, "Cow tipping?,He was like, "Yeah. Cows sleep standing up.,So if you approach them from behind, down wind,,you can push them over and they go thud in the mud.",So before I had a chance to determine whether this was right or not,,we had jumped the moat, we had climbed the fence,,we were tiptoeing through the dung,and approaching some poor, dozing cow. 
 So a few weeks after my diagnosis,,we went up to Vermont,,and I decided to put Jeff as the first person in the Council of Dads.,And we went to this apple orchard, and I read him this letter.,"Will you help be their dad?",And I got to the end -- he was crying and I was crying --,and then he looked at me, and he said, "Yes.",I was like, "Yes?",I kind of had forgotten there was a question at the heart of my letter.,And frankly, although I keep getting asked this,,it never occurred to me that anybody would turn me down,under the circumstances.,And then I asked him a question, which I ended up asking to all the dads,and ended up really encouraging me to write this story down in a book.,And that was, "What's the one piece of advice,you would give to my girls?" 
 And Jeff's advice was,,"Be a traveller, not a tourist.,Get off the bus. Seek out what's different.,Approach the cow.","So it's 10 years from now," I said,,"and my daughters are about to take their first trip abroad, and I'm not here.,What would you tell them?",He said, "I would approach this journey,as a young child might approach a mud puddle.,You can bend over and look at your reflection in the mirror,and maybe run your finger and make a small ripple,,or you can jump in and thrash around,and see what it feels like, what it smells like.",And as he talked he had that glint in his eye,that I first saw back in Holland --,the glint that says, "Let's go cow tipping,",even though we never did tip the cow,,even though no one tips the cow,,even though cows don't sleep standing up.,He said, "I want to see you back here girls, at the end of this experience,,covered in mud." 
 Two weeks after my diagnosis, a biopsy confirmed,I had a seven-inch osteosarcoma,in my left femur.,Six hundred Americans a year get an osteosarcoma.,Eighty-five percent are under 21.,Only a hundred adults a year,get one of these diseases.,Twenty years ago, doctors would have cut off my leg and hoped,,and there was a 15 percent survival rate.,And then in the 1980's, they determined,that one particular cocktail of chemo could be effective,,and within weeks I had started that regimen.,And since we are in a medical room,,I went through four and a half months of chemo.,Actually I had Cisplatin, Doxorubicin,and very high-dose Methotrexate. 
 And then I had a 15-hour surgery,in which my surgeon, Dr. John Healey,at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York,,took out my left femur,and replaced it with titanium.,And if you did see the Sanjay special,,you saw these enormous screws,that they screwed into my pelvis.,Then he took my fibula from my calf,,cut it out and then relocated it to my thigh,,where it now lives.,And what he actually did was he de-vascularized it from my calf,and re-vascularized it in my thigh,and then connected it,to the good parts of my knee and my hip.,And then he took out a third of my quadriceps muscle.,This is a surgery so rare,only two human beings have survived it before me.,And my reward for surviving it,was to go back for four more months of chemo.,It was, as we said in my house,,a lost year. 
 Because in those opening weeks, we all had nightmares.,And one night I had a nightmare that I was walking through my house,,sat at my desk and saw photographs of someone else's children,sitting on my desk.,And I remember a particular one night that, when you told that story of --,I don't know where you are Dr. Nuland --,of William Sloane Coffin --,it made me think of it.,Because I was in the hospital after, I think it was my fourth round of chemo,when my numbers went to zero, and I had basically no immune system.,And they put me in an infectious disease ward at the hospital.,And anybody who came to see me had to cover themselves in a mask,and cover all of the extraneous parts of their body.,And one night I got a call from my mother-in-law,that my daughters, at that time three and a half,,were missing me and feeling my absence.,And I hung up the phone,,and I put my face in my hands,,and I screamed this silent scream.,And what you said, Dr. Nuland -- I don't know where you are --,made me think of this today.,Because the thought that came to my mind,was that the feeling that I had,was like a primal scream. 
 And what was so striking --,and one of the messages I want to leave you here with today --,is the experience.,As I became less and less human --,and at this moment in my life, I was probably 30 pounds less than I am right now.,Of course, I had no hair and no immune system.,They were actually putting blood inside my body.,At that moment I was less and less human,,I was also, at the same time,,maybe the most human I've ever been.,And what was so striking about that time,was, instead of repulsing people,,I was actually proving to be a magnet for people.,People were incredibly drawn.,When my wife and I had kids, we thought it would be all-hands-on-deck.,Instead, it was everybody running the other way.,And when I had cancer, we thought it'd be everybody running the other way.,Instead, it was all-hands-on-deck.,And when people came to me,,rather than being incredibly turned off by what they saw --,I was like a living ghost --,they were incredibly moved,to talk about what was going on in their own lives. 
 Cancer, I found, is a passport to intimacy.,It is an invitation, maybe even a mandate,,to enter the most vital arenas of human life,,the most sensitive and the most frightening,,the ones that we never want to go to,,but when we do go there,,we feel incredibly transformed when we do.,And this also happened to my girls as they began to see,,and, we thought, maybe became an ounce more compassionate.,One day, my daughter Tybee,,Tybee came to me, and she said, "I have so much love for you in my body, daddy,,I can't stop giving you hugs and kisses.,And when I have no more love left, I just drink milk,,because that's where love comes from.",(Laughter),And one night my daughter Eden came to me.,And as I lifted my leg out of bed,,she reached for my crutches and handed them to me.,In fact, if I cling to one memory of this year,,it would be walking down a darkened hallway,with five spongy fingers,grasping the handle underneath my hand.,I didn't need the crutch anymore,,I was walking on air. 
 And one of the profound things that happened,was this act of actually connecting to all these people.,And it made me think -- and I'll just note for the record --,one word that I've only heard once actually,was when we were all doing Tony Robbins yoga yesterday --,the one word that has not been mentioned in this seminar actually,is the word "friend.",And yet from everything we've been talking about --,compliance, or addiction, or weight loss --,we now know that community is important,,and yet it's one thing we don't actually bring in.,And there was something incredibly profound,about sitting down with my closest friends,and telling them what they meant to me.,And one of the things that I learned is that over time,,particularly men, who used to be non-communicative,,are becoming more and more communicative.,And that particularly happened -- there was one in my life --,is this Council of Dads,that Linda said, what we were talking about,,it's like what the moms talk about at school drop-off. 
 And no one captures this modern manhood to me,more than David Black.,Now David is my literary agent.,He's about five-foot three and a half on a good day,,standing fully upright in cowboy boots.,And on kind of the manly-male front, he answers the phone --,I can say this I guess because you've done it here --,he answers the phone, "Yo, motherfucker.",He gives boring speeches about obscure bottles of wine,,and on his 50th birthday he bought a convertible sports car --,although, like a lot of men, he's impatient; he bought it on his 49th.,But like a lot of modern men, he hugs, he bakes,,he leaves work early to coach Little League.,Someone asked me if he cried when I asked him to be in the council of dads.,I was like, "David cries when you invite him to take a walk.",(Laughter),But he's a literary agent,,which means he's a broker of dreams in a world where most dreams don't come true.,And this is what we wanted him to capture --,what it means to have setbacks and then aspirations.,And I said, "What's the most valuable thing you can give to a dreamer?",And he said, "A belief in themselves.","But when I came to see you," I said, "I didn't believe in myself.,I was at a wall.",He said, "I don't see the wall," and I'm telling you the same,,Don't see the wall.,You may encounter one from time to time,,but you've got to find a way to get over it, around it, or through it.,But whatever you do, don't succumb to it.,Don't give in to the wall. 
 My home is not far from the Brooklyn Bridge,,and during the year and a half I was on crutches,,it became a sort of symbol to me.,So one day near the end of my journey,,I said, "Come on girls, let's take a walk across the Brooklyn Bridge.",We set out on crutches.,I was on crutches, my wife was next to me,,my girls were doing these rockstar poses up ahead.,And because walking was one of the first things I lost,,I spent most of that year,thinking about this most elemental of human acts.,Walking upright, we are told,,is the threshold of what made us human.,And yet, for the four million years humans have been walking upright,,the act is essentially unchanged.,As my physical therapist likes to say,,"Every step is a tragedy waiting to happen.",You nearly fall with one leg,,then you catch yourself with the other.,And the biggest consequence of walking on crutches --,as I did for a year and a half --,is that you walk slower.,You hurry,,you get where you're going, but you get there alone.,You go slow, you get where you're going,,but you get there with this community,you built along the way. 
 At the risk of admission, I was never nicer,than the year I was on crutches.,200 years ago,,a new type of pedestrian appeared in Paris.,He was called a "flaneur," one who wanders the arcades.,And it was the custom of those flaneurs,to show they were men of leisure,by taking turtles for walks,and letting the reptile set the pace.,And I just love this ode to slow moving.,And it's become my own motto for my girls.,Take a walk with a turtle.,Behold the world in pause.,And this idea of pausing,may be the single biggest lesson I took from my journey. 
 There's a quote from Moses,on the side of the Liberty Bell,,and it comes from a passage in the book of Leviticus,,that every seven years you should let the land lay fallow.,And every seven sets of seven years,,the land gets an extra year of rest,during which time all families are reunited,and people surrounded with the ones they love.,That 50th year is called the jubilee year,,and it's the origin of that term.,And though I'm shy of 50,,it captures my own experience.,My lost year was my jubilee year.,By laying fallow,,I planted the seeds for a healthier future,and was reunited with the ones I love. 
 Come the one year anniversary of my journey,,I went to see my surgeon, Dr. John Healey --,and by the way, Healey, great name for a doctor.,He's the president of the International Society of Limb Salvage,,which is the least euphemistic term I've ever heard.,And I said, "Dr. Healey, if my daughters come to you one day,and say, 'What should I learn from my daddy's story?',what would you tell them?",He said, "I would tell them what I know,,and that is everybody dies,,but not everybody lives.,I want you to live." 
 I wrote a letter to my girls,that appears at the end of my book, "The Council of Dads,",and I listed these lessons,,a few of which you've heard here today:,Approach the cow, pack your flipflops,,don't see the wall,,live the questions,,harvest miracles.,As I looked at this list -- to me it was sort of like a psalm book of living --,I realized, we may have done it for our girls,,but it really changed us.,And that is, the secret of the Council of Dads,,is that my wife and I did this,in an attempt to help our daughters,,but it really changed us. 
 So I stand here today,as you see now, walking without crutches or a cane.,And last week I had my 18-month scans.,And as you all know,,anybody with cancer has to get follow-up scans.,In my case it's quarterly.,And all the collective minds in this room, I dare say,,can never find a solution for scan-xiety.,As I was going there, I was wondering, what would I say,depending on what happened here.,I got good news that day,,and I stand here today cancer-free,,walking without aid,and hobbling forward. 
 And I just want to mention briefly in passing -- I'm past my time limit --,but I just want to briefly mention in passing,that one of the nice things that can come out of a conference like this,is, at a similar meeting,,back in the spring,,Anne Wojcicki heard about our story,and very quickly -- in a span of three weeks --,put the full resources of 23andMe,,and we announced an initiative in July,to get to decode the genome,of anybody, a living person,with a heart tissue, bone sarcoma.,And she told me last night, in the three months since we've done it,,we've gotten 300 people who've contributed to this program.,And the epidemiologists here will tell you,,that's half the number of people who get the disease,in one year in the United States.,So if you go to 23andMe,,or if you go to councilofdads.com, you can click on a link.,And we encourage anybody to join this effort. 
 But I'll just close what I've been talking about,by leaving you with this message:,May you find an excuse to reach out to some long-lost pal,,or to that college roommate,,or to some person you may have turned away from.,May you find a mud puddle to jump in someplace,,or find a way to get over, around, or through any wall,that stands between you and one of your dreams.,And every now and then,,find a friend, find a turtle,,and take a long, slow walk. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)So, security is two different things:,it's a feeling, and it's a reality.,And they're different.,You could feel secure even if you're not.,And you can be secure,even if you don't feel it.,Really, we have two separate concepts,mapped onto the same word.,And what I want to do in this talknis to split them apart --,figuring out when they divergenand how they converge.,And language is actually a problem here.,There aren't a lot of good words,for the conceptsnwe're going to talk about.,So if you look at securitynfrom economic terms,,it's a trade-off. 
 Every time you get some security,nyou're always trading off something.,Whether this is a personal decision --,whether you're going to installna burglar alarm in your home --,or a national decision,,where you're going to invadena foreign country --,you're going to trade off something:nmoney or time, convenience, capabilities,,maybe fundamental liberties.,And the question to asknwhen you look at a security anything,is not whether this makes us safer,,but whether it's worth the trade-off.,You've heard in the pastnseveral years, the world is safer,because Saddam Hussein is not in power.,That might be true,nbut it's not terribly relevant.,The question is: Was it worth it?,And you can make your own decision,,and then you'll decidenwhether the invasion was worth it.,That's how you think about security:nin terms of the trade-off. 
 Now, there's often no right or wrong here.,Some of us have a burglar alarmnsystem at home and some of us don't.,And it'll depend on where we live,,whether we live alone or have a family,,how much cool stuff we have,,how much we're willingnto accept the risk of theft.,In politics also,nthere are different opinions.,A lot of times, these trade-offsnare about more than just security,,and I think that's really important.,Now, people have a natural intuitionnabout these trade-offs.,We make them every day.,Last night in my hotel room,nwhen I decided to double-lock the door,,or you in your car when you drove here;,when we go eat lunch,and decide the food's notnpoison and we'll eat it. 
 We make these trade-offs again and again,,multiple times a day.,We often won't even notice them.,They're just partnof being alive; we all do it.,Every species does it.,Imagine a rabbit in a field, eating grass.,And the rabbit sees a fox.,That rabbit will makena security trade-off:,"Should I stay, or should I flee?",And if you think about it,,the rabbits that are goodnat making that trade-off,will tend to live and reproduce,,and the rabbits that are bad at it,will get eaten or starve.,So you'd think,that us, as a successful speciesnon the planet -- you, me, everybody --,would be really goodnat making these trade-offs.,Yet it seems, again and again,nthat we're hopelessly bad at it. 
 And I think that's a fundamentallyninteresting question.,I'll give you the short answer.,The answer is, we respondnto the feeling of security,and not the reality.,Now, most of the time, that works.,Most of the time,,feeling and reality are the same.,Certainly that's truenfor most of human prehistory.,We've developed this ability,because it makes evolutionary sense.,One way to think of itnis that we're highly optimized,for risk decisions,that are endemic to livingnin small family groups,in the East African Highlandsnin 100,000 BC.,2010 New York, not so much.,Now, there are several biasesnin risk perception.,A lot of good experiments in this.,And you can see certain biasesnthat come up again and again.,I'll give you four. 
 We tend to exaggeratenspectacular and rare risks,and downplay common risks --,so, flying versus driving.,The unknown is perceivednto be riskier than the familiar.,One example would be:,people fear kidnapping by strangers,,when the data supports that kidnappingnby relatives is much more common.,This is for children.,Third, personified risksnare perceived to be greater,than anonymous risks.,So, Bin Laden is scariernbecause he has a name.,And the fourth is:,people underestimate risksnin situations they do control,and overestimate themnin situations they don't control.,So once you take up skydiving or smoking,,you downplay the risks.,If a risk is thrust upon you --nterrorism is a good example --,you'll overplay it,,because you don't feelnlike it's in your control. 
 There are a bunchnof other of these cognitive biases,,that affect our risk decisions.,There's the availability heuristic,,which basically means we estimatenthe probability of something,by how easy it is to bringninstances of it to mind.,So you can imagine how that works.,If you hear a lot about tiger attacks,nthere must be a lot of tigers around.,You don't hear about lion attacks,nthere aren't a lot of lions around.,This works, until you invent newspapers,,because what newspapers donis repeat again and again,rare risks.,I tell people: if it's in the news,ndon't worry about it,,because by definition, news is somethingnthat almost never happens. 
 (Laughter) 
 When something is so common,nit's no longer news.,Car crashes, domestic violence --,those are the risks you worry about.,We're also a species of storytellers.,We respond to stories more than data.,And there's some basicninnumeracy going on.,I mean, the joke "One, two,nthree, many" is kind of right.,We're really good at small numbers.,One mango, two mangoes, three mangoes,,10,000 mangoes, 100,000 mangoes --,it's still more mangoesnyou can eat before they rot.,So one half, one quarter,none fifth -- we're good at that.,One in a million, one in a billion --,they're both almost never. 
 So we have trouble with the risksnthat aren't very common.,And what these cognitive biases do,is they act as filtersnbetween us and reality.,And the result is that feelingnand reality get out of whack,,they get different.,Now, you either have a feeling --nyou feel more secure than you are,,there's a false sense of security.,Or the other way, and that's a falsensense of insecurity. 
 I write a lot about "security theater,",which are productsnthat make people feel secure,,but don't actually do anything.,There's no real word for stuffnthat makes us secure,,but doesn't make us feel secure.,Maybe it's what the CIAnis supposed to do for us.,So back to economics.,If economics, if the market,ndrives security,,and if people make trade-offsnbased on the feeling of security,,then the smart thing for companies to donfor the economic incentives,is to make people feel secure.,And there are two ways to do this. 
 One, you can make people actually secure,and hope they notice.,Or two, you can make peoplenjust feel secure,and hope they don't notice.,Right?,So what makes people notice?,Well, a couple of things:,understanding of the security,,of the risks, the threats,,the countermeasures, how they work.,But if you know stuff, you're more likely,to have your feelings match reality.,Enough real-world examples helps.,We all know the crime ratenin our neighborhood,,because we live there,nand we get a feeling about it,that basically matches reality.,Security theater is exposed,when it's obviousnthat it's not working properly. 
 OK. So what makes people not notice?,Well, a poor understanding.,If you don't understand the risks,nyou don't understand the costs,,you're likely to get the trade-off wrong,,and your feeling doesn't match reality.,Not enough examples.,There's an inherent problemnwith low-probability events.,If, for example, terrorismnalmost never happens,,it's really hard to judge the efficacynof counter-terrorist measures.,This is why you keep sacrificing virgins,,and why your unicorn defensesnare working just great.,There aren't enough examples of failures.,Also, feelings that cloud the issues --,the cognitive biases I talkednabout earlier: fears, folk beliefs --,basically, an inadequate model of reality. 
 So let me complicate things.,I have feeling and reality.,I want to add a third element.nI want to add "model.",Feeling and model are in our head,,reality is the outside world;nit doesn't change, it's real.,Feeling is based on our intuition,,model is based on reason.,That's basically the difference.,In a primitive and simple world,,there's really no reason for a model,,because feeling is close to reality.,You don't need a model.,But in a modern and complex world,,you need models to understandna lot of the risks we face. 
 There's no feeling about germs.,You need a model to understand them.,This model is an intelligentnrepresentation of reality.,It's, of course, limitednby science, by technology.,We couldn't have a germ theory of disease,before we inventednthe microscope to see them.,It's limited by our cognitive biases.,But it has the abilitynto override our feelings.,Where do we get these models?nWe get them from others.,We get them from religion,nfrom culture, teachers, elders. 
 A couple years ago,nI was in South Africa on safari.,The tracker I was with grew upnin Kruger National Park.,He had some very complexnmodels of how to survive.,And it depended on if you were attackednby a lion, leopard, rhino, or elephant --,and when you had to run away,nwhen you couldn't run away,,when you had to climb a tree,nwhen you could never climb a tree.,I would have died in a day.,But he was born there,nand he understood how to survive.,I was born in New York City.,I could have taken him to New York,nand he would have died in a day. 
 (Laughter) 
 Because we had different modelsnbased on our different experiences.,Models can come from the media,,from our elected officials ...,Think of models of terrorism,,child kidnapping,,airline safety, car safety.,Models can come from industry.,The two I'm followingnare surveillance cameras,,ID cards,,quite a lot of our computernsecurity models come from there. 
 A lot of models come from science.,Health models are a great example.,Think of cancer, bird flu,nswine flu, SARS.,All of our feelings of securitynabout those diseases,come from models given to us, really,nby science filtered through the media.,So models can change.,Models are not static.,As we become more comfortablenin our environments,,our model can move closer to our feelings. 
 So an example might be,,if you go back 100 years ago,,when electricity was firstnbecoming common,,there were a lot of fears about it.,There were people who were afraidnto push doorbells,,because there was electricitynin there, and that was dangerous.,For us, we're very facilenaround electricity.,We change light bulbsnwithout even thinking about it.,Our model of security around electricitynis something we were born into.,It hasn't changed as we were growing up.,And we're good at it.,Or think of the risks on the Internetnacross generations --,how your parents approachnInternet security,,versus how you do,,versus how our kids will. 
 Models eventually fadeninto the background.,"Intuitive" is justnanother word for familiar.,So as your model is close to realitynand it converges with feelings,,you often don't even know it's there.,A nice example of this camenfrom last year and swine flu.,When swine flu first appeared,,the initial news causedna lot of overreaction.,Now, it had a name,,which made it scariernthan the regular flu,,even though it was more deadly.,And people thought doctorsnshould be able to deal with it.,So there was that feelingnof lack of control.,And those two thingsnmade the risk more than it was. 
 As the novelty wore offnand the months went by,,there was some amount of tolerance;npeople got used to it.,There was no new data,nbut there was less fear.,By autumn,,people thought the doctorsnshould have solved this already.,And there's kind of a bifurcation:,people had to choosenbetween fear and acceptance --,actually, fear and indifference --,and they kind of chose suspicion.,And when the vaccine appeared last winter,,there were a lot of people --na surprising number --,who refused to get it.,And it's a nice example of hownpeople's feelings of security change,,how their model changes,,sort of wildly,,with no new information,nwith no new input.,This kind of thing happens a lot. 
 I'm going to give one more complication.,We have feeling, model, reality.,I have a very relativisticnview of security.,I think it depends on the observer.,And most security decisionsnhave a variety of people involved.,And stakeholders with specific trade-offsnwill try to influence the decision.,And I call that their agenda.,And you see agenda --nthis is marketing, this is politics --,trying to convince you to havenone model versus another,,trying to convince you to ignore a model,and trust your feelings,,marginalizing peoplenwith models you don't like.,This is not uncommon.,An example, a great example,nis the risk of smoking.,In the history of the past 50 years,,the smoking risk showsnhow a model changes,,and it also shows how an industry fightsnagainst a model it doesn't like. 
 Compare that to the secondhandnsmoke debate --,probably about 20 years behind.,Think about seat belts.,When I was a kid, no one wore a seat belt.,Nowadays, no kid will let you drivenif you're not wearing a seat belt.,Compare that to the airbag debate,,probably about 30 years behind.,All examples of models changing.,What we learn is that changingnmodels is hard.,Models are hard to dislodge.,If they equal your feelings,,you don't even know you have a model.,And there's another cognitive bias,I'll call confirmation bias,,where we tend to accept datanthat confirms our beliefs,and reject datanthat contradicts our beliefs.,So evidence against our model,nwe're likely to ignore,,even if it's compelling.,It has to get very compellingnbefore we'll pay attention. 
 New models that extendnlong periods of time are hard.,Global warming is a great example.,We're terrible at modelsnthat span 80 years.,We can do "to the next harvest.",We can often do "until our kids grow up.",But "80 years," we're just not good at.,So it's a very hard model to accept.,We can have both modelsnin our head simultaneously --,that kind of problem wherenwe're holding both beliefs together,,the cognitive dissonance.,Eventually, the new modelnwill replace the old model. 
 Strong feelings can create a model.,September 11 created a security modelnin a lot of people's heads.,Also, personal experiencesnwith crime can do it,,personal health scare,,a health scare in the news.,You'll see these calledn"flashbulb events" by psychiatrists.,They can create a model instantaneously,,because they're very emotive.,So in the technological world,,we don't have experience to judge models.,And we rely on others. We rely on proxies.,And this works, as long asnit's the correct others. 
 We rely on government agencies,to tell us what pharmaceuticals are safe.,I flew here yesterday.,I didn't check the airplane.,I relied on some other group,to determine whethernmy plane was safe to fly.,We're here, none of us fear the roofnis going to collapse on us,,not because we checked,,but because we're pretty surenthe building codes here are good.,It's a model we just accept,pretty much by faith.,And that's OK. 
 Now, what we want is peoplento get familiar enough with better models,,have it reflected in their feelings,,to allow them to make security trade-offs.,When these go out of whack,nyou have two options.,One, you can fix people's feelings,ndirectly appeal to feelings.,It's manipulation, but it can work.,The second, more honest way,is to actually fix the model.,Change happens slowly.,The smoking debate took 40 years --nand that was an easy one.,Some of this stuff is hard.,Really, though, informationnseems like our best hope. 
 And I lied.,Remember I said feeling, model, reality;nreality doesn't change?,It actually does.,We live in a technological world;,reality changes all the time.,So we might have,nfor the first time in our species:,feeling chases model, model chasesnreality, reality's moving --,they might never catch up.,We don't know.,But in the long term,,both feeling and reality are important. 
 And I want to close with two quicknstories to illustrate this.,1982 -- I don't know if peoplenwill remember this --,there was a short epidemicnof Tylenol poisonings,in the United States.,It's a horrific story.,Someone took a bottle of Tylenol,,put poison in it, closed it up,nput it back on the shelf,,someone else bought it and died.,This terrified people.,There were a couple of copycat attacks.,There wasn't any real risk,nbut people were scared.,And this is how the tamper-proofndrug industry was invented.,Those tamper-proof caps?nThat came from this.,It's complete security theater.,As a homework assignment,nthink of 10 ways to get around it.,I'll give you one: a syringe.,But it made people feel better.,It made their feeling of securitynmore match the reality. 
 Last story: a few years ago,na friend of mine gave birth.,I visit her in the hospital.,It turns out, when a baby's born now,,they put an RFID bracelet on the baby,na corresponding one on the mother,,so if anyone other than the mother takesnthe baby out of the maternity ward,,an alarm goes off.,I said, "Well, that's kind of neat.,I wonder how rampantnbaby snatching is out of hospitals.",I go home, I look it up.,It basically never happens. 
 (Laughter) 
 But if you think about it,nif you are a hospital,,and you need to take a babynaway from its mother,,out of the room to run some tests,,you better have some goodnsecurity theater,,or she's going to rip your arm off. 
 (Laughter) 
 So it's important for us,,those of us who design security,,who look at security policy --,or even look at public policynin ways that affect security.,It's not just reality;nit's feeling and reality.,What's important,is that they be about the same.,It's important that,nif our feelings match reality,,we make better security trade-offs. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)How often do we hearnthat people just don't care?,How many times have you been told,that real, substantial changenisn't possible,because most people are too selfish,,too stupid or too lazy,to try to make a differencenin their community?,I propose to you todaynthat apathy as we think we know it,doesn't actually exist;,but rather, that people do care,,but that we live in a worldnthat actively discourages engagement,by constantly putting obstaclesnand barriers in our way. 
 I'll give you somenexamples of what I mean.,Let's start with city hall.,You ever see one of these before?,This is a newspaper ad.,It's a notice of a zoning applicationnchange for a new office building,so the neighborhoodnknows what's happening.,As you can see, it's impossible to read.,You need to get halfway down,to even find out which addressnthey're talking about,,and then further down,nin tiny 10-point font,,to find out how to actually get involved.,Imagine if the private sectornadvertised in the same way --,if Nike wanted to sell a pair of shoes -- 
 (Laughter) 
 And put an ad in the paper like that. 
 (Applause) 
 Now, that would never happen.,You'll never see an ad like that,,because Nike actually wantsnyou to buy their shoes,,whereas the city of Torontonclearly doesn't want you involved,with the planning process,,otherwise their ads would looknsomething like this,,with all the information laid out clearly.,As long as the city's putting outnnotices like this,to try to get people engaged,,then of course peoplenaren't going to be engaged.,But that's not apathy;nthat's intentional exclusion. 
 Public space. 
 (Applause) 
 The manner in which we mistreatnour public spaces,is a huge obstacle towards any typenof progressive political change,,because we've essentially put a price tagnon freedom of expression.,Whoever has the most moneyngets the loudest voice,,dominating the visualnand mental environment.,The problem with this modelnis there are some amazing messages,that need to be said,nthat aren't profitable to say.,So you're never goingnto see them on a billboard. 
 The media plays an important role,in developing our relationshipnwith political change,,mainly by ignoring politics and focusingnon celebrities and scandals,,but even when they do talknabout important political issues,,they do it in a way that I feelndiscourages engagement.,I'll give you an example.,The "Now" magazine from last week:nprogressive, downtown weekly in Toronto.,This is the cover story.,It's an articlenabout a theater performance,,and it starts with basicninformation about where it is,,in case you actually want to go and seenit after you've read the article --,where, the time, the website.,Same with this -- it's a movie review.,An art review.,A book review -- where the readingnis in case you want to go.,A restaurant -- you might notnwant to just read about it,,maybe you want to go there.,So they tell you where it is, the prices,nthe address, the phone number, etc. 
 Then you get to their political articles.,Here's a great article about an importantnelection race that's happening.,It talks about the candidates,nwritten very well,,but no information, no follow-up,nno websites for the campaigns,,no information about when the debatesnare, where the campaign offices are.,Here's another good article,,about a new campaignnopposing privatization of transit,,without any contact informationnfor the campaign.,The message seems to be,that the readers are most likelynto want to eat, maybe read a book,,maybe see a movie, but not be engagednin their community.,You might think this is a small thing,nbut I think it's important,,because it sets a tone,and it reinforces the dangerous ideanthat politics is a spectator sport. 
 Heroes: How do we view leadership?,Look at these 10 movies.nWhat do they have in common?,Anyone?,They all have heroes who were chosen.,Someone came up to them and said,n"You're the chosen one.,There's a prophecy.nYou have to save the world.",And then they go off and save the worldnbecause they've been told to,,with a few people tagging along.,This helps me understand,why a lot of people have troublenseeing themselves as leaders --,because it sends all the wrong messagesnabout what leadership is about.,A heroic effort is a collective effort,,number one.,Number two, it's imperfect;nit's not very glamorous,,and doesn't suddenly startnand suddenly end.,It's an ongoing process your whole life.,But most importantly, it's voluntary.,It's voluntary.,As long as we're teaching our kids,that heroism starts when someonenscratches a mark on your forehead,,or someone tells younyou're part of a prophecy,,they're missing the most importantncharacteristic of leadership,,which is that it comes from within.,It's about followingnyour own dreams, uninvited,,and then working with othersnto make those dreams come true. 
 Political parties: oh, boy.,Political parties could and should benone of the basic entry points,for people to get engaged in politics.,Instead, they've become, sadly,,uninspiring and uncreative organizations,that rely so heavily on market researchnand polling and focus groups,that they end up all sayingnthe same thing,,pretty much regurgitating backnto us what we already want to hear,at the expense of putting forwardnbold and creative ideas.,And people can smell that,nand it feeds cynicism. 
 (Applause) 
 Charitable status.,Groups who have charitable statusnin Canada aren't allowed to do advocacy.,This is a huge problemnand a huge obstacle to change,,because it means that somenof the most passionate and informed voices,are completely silenced,nespecially during election time.,Which leads us to the last one,nwhich is: our elections. 
 As you may have noticed,,our elections in Canadanare a complete joke.,We use out-of-date systems,that are unfair and create random results.,Canada's currently led by a party,that most Canadians didn't actually want.,How can we honestly and genuinelynencourage more people to vote,when votes don't count in Canada?,You add all this up together,nand of course people are apathetic.,It's like trying to run into a brick wall. 
 Now, I'm not trying to be negativenby throwing all these obstacles out,and explaining what's in our way.,Quite the opposite --,I actually think people are amazingnand smart and that they do care,,but that, as I said,nwe live in this environment,where all these obstaclesnare being put in our way.,As long as we believenthat people, our own neighbors,,are selfish, stupid or lazy,,then there's no hope.,But we can changenall those things I mentioned.,We can open up city hall.,We can reform our electoral systems.,We can democratize our public spaces. 
 My main message is:,if we can redefine apathy,,not as some kind of internal syndrome,,but as a complex web of cultural barriersnthat reinforces disengagement,,and if we can clearly define,nclearly identify what those obstacles are,,and then if we can work togetherncollectively to dismantle those obstacles,,then anything is possible. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)You may have heardnabout the Koran's idea of paradise,being 72 virgins,,and I promise I will come backnto those virgins.,But in fact, here in the Northwest,nwe're living very close,to the real Koranic idea of paradise,,defined 36 times as "gardensnwatered by running streams.",Since I live on a houseboatnon the running stream of Lake Union,,this makes perfect sense to me.,But the thing is, how comenit's news to most people?,I know many well-intentioned non-Muslims,who've begun readingnthe Koran, but given up,,disconcerted by its "otherness.",The historian Thomas Carlylenconsidered Muhammad,one of the world's greatest heroes,,yet even he called the Koran,"as toilsome reading as I ever undertook;na wearisome, confused jumble." 
 (Laughter) 
 Part of the problem,nI think, is that we imagine,that the Koran can be readnas we usually read a book --,as though we can curl upnwith it on a rainy afternoon,with a bowl of popcorn within reach,,as though God --,and the Koran is entirely in the voicenof God speaking to Muhammad --,were just another authornon the best-seller list.,Yet, the fact that so few peoplendo actually read the Koran,is precisely why it's so easy to quote --nthat is, to misquote. 
 (Laughter) 
 Phrases and snippets taken out of context,in what I call the "highlighter version,",which is the one favorednby both Muslim fundamentalists,and anti-Muslim Islamophobes. 
 So this past spring,,as I was gearing up to begin writingna biography of Muhammad,,I realized I needed to readnthe Koran properly --,as properly as I could, that is.,My Arabic is reduced by nownto wielding a dictionary,,so I took four well-known translations,and decided to read themnside by side, verse by verse,,along with a transliterationnand the original seventh-century Arabic.,Now, I did have an advantage.,My last book was about the storynbehind the Shi'a-Sunni split,,and for that, I'd worked closelynwith the earliest Islamic histories,,so I knew the eventsnto which the Koran constantly refers,,its frame of reference.,I knew enough, that is, to knownthat I'd be a tourist in the Koran --,an informed one,,an experienced one, even,,but still an outsider,,an agnostic Jew readingnsomeone else's holy book. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I read slowly. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'd set aside three weeksnfor this project,,and that, I think,nis what is meant by "hubris" -- 
 (Laughter) 
 because it turned out to be three months. 
 (Laughter) 
 I did resist the temptationnto skip to the back,,where the shorter and morenclearly mystical chapters are.,But every time I thought I was beginningnto get a handle on the Koran --,that feeling of "I get it now" --,it would slip away overnight,,and I'd come back in the morning,,wondering if I wasn't lostnin a strange land.,And yet, the terrain was very familiar.,The Koran declares that it comesnto renew the message,of the Torah and the Gospels.,So one-third of it reprisesnthe stories of Biblical figures,like Abraham, Moses, Joseph, Mary, Jesus.,God himself was utterly familiar,from his earlier manifestation as Yahweh,,jealously insisting on no other gods.,The presence of camels, mountains,ndesert wells and springs,took me back to the year I spentnwandering the Sinai Desert.,And then there was the language,nthe rhythmic cadence of it,,reminding me of evenings spentnlistening to Bedouin elders,recite hours-long narrative poems,entirely from memory.,And I began to grasp why it's said,that the Koran is reallynthe Koran only in Arabic. 
 Take the Fatihah,nthe seven-verse opening chapter,that is the Lord's Prayernand the Shema Yisrael of Islam combined.,It's just 29 words in Arabic,,but anywhere from 65 to 72 in translation.,And yet the more you add,nthe more seems to go missing.,The Arabic has an incantatory,nalmost hypnotic quality,that begs to be heard rather than read,,felt more than analyzed.,It wants to be chanted out loud,,to sound its music in the earnand on the tongue.,So the Koran in Englishnis a kind of shadow of itself,,or as Arthur Arberry called his version,,"an interpretation.",But all is not lost in translation. 
 As the Koran promises,npatience is rewarded,,and there are many surprises --,a degree of environmentalnawareness, for instance,,and of humans as mere stewardsnof God's creation,,unmatched in the Bible.,And where the Bible is addressednexclusively to men,,using the second-nand third-person masculine,,the Koran includes women --,talking, for instance,,of believing men and believing women,,honorable men and honorable women.,Or take the infamous versenabout killing the unbelievers.,Yes, it does say that,,but in a very specific context:,the anticipated conquestnof the sanctuary city of Mecca,,where fighting was usually forbidden.,And the permission comesnhedged about with qualifiers.,Not "You must kill unbelievers in Mecca,",but you can, you are allowed to,,but only after a grace period is over,,and only if there's no othernpact in place,,and only if they try to stopnyou getting to the Kaaba,,and only if they attack you first.,And even then -- God is merciful;,forgiveness is supreme --,and so, essentially,,better if you don't. 
 (Laughter) 
 This was perhaps the biggest surprise --,how flexible the Koran is,,at least in minds that are notnfundamentally inflexible. 
 "Some of these versesnare definite in meaning," it says,,"and others are ambiguous.",The perverse at heartnwill seek out the ambiguities,,trying to create discordnby pinning down meanings of their own.,Only God knows the true meaning.,The phrase "God is subtle"nappears again and again,,and indeed, the wholenof the Koran is far more subtle,than most of us have been led to believe.,As in, for instance, that little matternof virgins and paradise.,Old-fashioned orientalismncomes into play here.,The word used four times is "houris,",rendered as dark-eyed maidensnwith swelling breasts,,or as fair, high-bosomed virgins.,Yet all there is in the original Arabicnis that one word: houris.,Not a swelling breastnor high bosom in sight. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now this may be a way of sayingn"pure beings," like in angels,,or it may be likenthe Greek "kouros" or "kore,",an eternal youth. 
 But the truth is, nobody really knows.,And that's the point.,Because the Koran is quite clear,when it says that you'll ben"a new creation in paradise,",and that you will be "recreatednin a form unknown to you,",which seems to mena far more appealing prospect,than a virgin. 
 (Laughter) 
 And that number 72 never appears.,There are no 72 virgins in the Koran.,That idea only cameninto being 300 years later,,and most Islamic scholarsnsee it as the equivalent,of people with wings sitting on cloudsnand strumming harps.,Paradise is quite the opposite.,It's not virginity;,it's fecundity;,it's plenty.,It's gardens watered by running streams. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)The world is changing,with really remarkable speed.,If you look at the chart at the top here,,you'll see that in 2025,,these Goldman Sachs projections,suggest that the Chinese economy,will be almost the same size as the American economy.,And if you look at the chart,for 2050,,it's projected that the Chinese economy,will be twice the size of the American economy,,and the Indian economy will be almost the same size,as the American economy.,And we should bear in mind here,that these projections were drawn up,before the Western financial crisis. 
 A couple of weeks ago,,I was looking at the latest projection,by BNP Paribas,for when China,will have a larger economy,than the United States.,Goldman Sachs projected 2027.,The post-crisis projection,is 2020.,That's just a decade away.,China is going to change the world,in two fundamental respects.,First of all,,it's a huge developing country,with a population of 1.3 billion people,,which has been growing for over 30 years,at around 10 percent a year. 
 And within a decade,,it will have the largest economy in the world.,Never before in the modern era,has the largest economy in the world,been that of a developing country,,rather than a developed country.,Secondly,,for the first time in the modern era,,the dominant country in the world --,which I think is what China will become --,will be not from the West,and from very, very different civilizational roots. 
 Now, I know it's a widespread assumption in the West,that as countries modernize,,they also westernize.,This is an illusion.,It's an assumption that modernity,is a product simply of competition, markets and technology.,It is not. It is also shaped equally,by history and culture.,China is not like the West,,and it will not become like the West.,It will remain in very fundamental respects,very different.,Now the big question here is obviously,,how do we make sense of China?,How do we try to understand what China is?,And the problem we have in the West at the moment, by and large,,is that the conventional approach,is that we understand it really in Western terms,,using Western ideas.,We can't.,Now I want to offer you,three building blocks,for trying to understand what China is like,,just as a beginning. 
 The first is this:,that China is not really a nation-state.,Okay, it's called itself a nation-state,for the last hundred years,,but everyone who knows anything about China,knows it's a lot older than this.,This was what China looked like with the victory of the Qin Dynasty,in 221 B.C. at the end of the warring-state period --,the birth of modern China.,And you can see it against the boundaries of modern China.,Or immediately afterward, the Han Dynasty,,still 2,000 years ago.,And you can see already it occupies,most of what we now know as Eastern China,,which is where the vast majority of Chinese lived then,and live now. 
 Now what is extraordinary about this,is, what gives China its sense of being China,,what gives the Chinese,the sense of what it is to be Chinese,,comes not from the last hundred years,,not from the nation-state period,,which is what happened in the West,,but from the period, if you like,,of the civilization-state.,I'm thinking here, for example,,of customs like ancestral worship,,of a very distinctive notion of the state,,likewise, a very distinctive notion of the family,,social relationships like guanxi,,Confucian values and so on.,These are all things that come,from the period of the civilization-state.,In other words, China, unlike the Western states and most countries in the world,,is shaped by its sense of civilization,,its existence as a civilization-state,,rather than as a nation-state.,And there's one other thing to add to this, and that is this:,Of course we know China's big, huge,,demographically and geographically,,with a population of 1.3 billion people.,What we often aren't really aware of,is the fact,that China is extremely diverse,and very pluralistic,,and in many ways very decentralized.,You can't run a place on this scale simply from Beijing,,even though we think this to be the case.,It's never been the case. 
 So this is China, a civilization-state,,rather than a nation-state.,And what does it mean?,Well, I think it has all sorts of profound implications.,I'll give you two quick ones.,The first is that,the most important political value for the Chinese,is unity,,is the maintenance,of Chinese civilization.,You know, 2,000 years ago, Europe:,breakdown -- the fragmentation of the Holy Roman Empire.,It divided, and it's remained divided ever since.,China, over the same time period,,went in exactly the opposite direction,,very painfully holding this huge civilization,,civilization-state, together. 
 The second,is maybe more prosaic,,which is Hong Kong.,Do you remember the handover of Hong Kong,by Britain to China in 1997?,You may remember,what the Chinese constitutional proposition was.,One country, two systems.,And I'll lay a wager,that barely anyone in the West believed them.,"Window dressing.,When China gets its hands on Hong Kong,,that won't be the case.",Thirteen years on,,the political and legal system in Hong Kong,is as different now as it was in 1997.,We were wrong. Why were we wrong?,We were wrong because we thought, naturally enough,,in nation-state ways.,Think of German unification, 1990.,What happened?,Well, basically the East was swallowed by the West.,One nation, one system.,That is the nation-state mentality.,But you can't run a country like China,,a civilization-state,,on the basis of one civilization, one system.,It doesn't work.,So actually the response of China,to the question of Hong Kong --,as it will be to the question of Taiwan --,was a natural response:,one civilization, many systems. 
 Let me offer you another building block,to try and understand China --,maybe not sort of a comfortable one.,The Chinese have a very, very different,conception of race,to most other countries.,Do you know,,of the 1.3 billion Chinese,,over 90 percent of them,think they belong to the same race,,the Han?,Now, this is completely different,from the world's [other] most populous countries.,India, the United States,,Indonesia, Brazil --,all of them are multiracial.,The Chinese don't feel like that.,China is only multiracial,really at the margins.,So the question is, why?,Well the reason, I think, essentially,is, again, back to the civilization-state.,A history of at least 2,000 years,,a history of conquest, occupation,,absorption, assimilation and so on,,led to the process by which,,over time, this notion of the Han emerged --,of course, nurtured,by a growing and very powerful sense,of cultural identity. 
 Now the great advantage of this historical experience,has been that, without the Han,,China could never have held together.,The Han identity has been the cement,which has held this country together.,The great disadvantage of it,is that the Han have a very weak conception,of cultural difference.,They really believe,in their own superiority,,and they are disrespectful,of those who are not.,Hence their attitude, for example,,to the Uyghurs and to the Tibetans. 
 Or let me give you my third building block,,the Chinese state.,Now the relationship,between the state and society in China,is very different from that in the West.,Now we in the West,overwhelmingly seem to think -- in these days at least --,that the authority and legitimacy of the state,is a function of democracy.,The problem with this proposition,is that the Chinese state,enjoys more legitimacy,and more authority,amongst the Chinese,than is true,with any Western state.,And the reason for this,is because --,well, there are two reasons, I think.,And it's obviously got nothing to do with democracy,,because in our terms the Chinese certainly don't have a democracy.,And the reason for this is,,firstly, because the state in China,is given a very special --,it enjoys a very special significance,as the representative,,the embodiment and the guardian,of Chinese civilization,,of the civilization-state.,This is as close as China gets,to a kind of spiritual role. 
 And the second reason is because,,whereas in Europe,and North America,,the state's power is continuously challenged --,I mean in the European tradition,,historically against the church,,against other sectors of the aristocracy,,against merchants and so on --,for 1,000 years,,the power of the Chinese state,has not been challenged.,It's had no serious rivals.,So you can see,that the way in which power has been constructed in China,is very different from our experience,in Western history.,The result, by the way,,is that the Chinese have a very different view of the state.,Whereas we tend to view it as an intruder,,a stranger,,certainly an organ,whose powers need to be limited,or defined and constrained,,the Chinese don't see the state like that at all.,The Chinese view the state,as an intimate -- not just as an intimate actually,,as a member of the family --,not just in fact as a member of the family,,but as the head of the family,,the patriarch of the family.,This is the Chinese view of the state --,very, very different to ours.,It's embedded in society in a different kind of way,to what is the case,in the West. 
 And I would suggest to you that actually what we are dealing with here,,in the Chinese context,,is a new kind of paradigm,,which is different from anything,we've had to think about in the past.,Know that China believes in the market and the state.,I mean, Adam Smith,,already writing in the late 18th century, said,,"The Chinese market is larger and more developed,and more sophisticated,than anything in Europe.",And, apart from the Mao period,,that has remained more or less the case ever since.,But this is combined,with an extremely strong and ubiquitous state.,The state is everywhere in China.,I mean, it's leading firms --,many of them are still publicly owned.,Private firms, however large they are, like Lenovo,,depend in many ways on state patronage.,Targets for the economy and so on,are set by the state.,And the state, of course, its authority flows into lots of other areas --,as we are familiar with --,with something like the one-child policy. 
 Moreover, this is a very old state tradition,,a very old tradition of statecraft.,I mean, if you want an illustration of this,,the Great Wall is one.,But this is another, this is the Grand Canal,,which was constructed in the first instance,in the fifth century B.C.,and was finally completed,in the seventh century A.D.,It went for 1,114 miles,,linking Beijing,with Hangzhou and Shanghai.,So there's a long history,of extraordinary state infrastructural projects,in China,,which I suppose helps us to explain what we see today,,which is something like the Three Gorges Dam,and many other expressions,of state competence,within China.,So there we have three building blocks,for trying to understand the difference that is China --,the civilization-state,,the notion of race,and the nature of the state,and its relationship to society. 
 And yet we still insist, by and large,,in thinking that we can understand China,by simply drawing on Western experience,,looking at it through Western eyes,,using Western concepts.,If you want to know why,we unerringly seem to get China wrong --,our predictions about what's going to happen to China are incorrect --,this is the reason.,Unfortunately, I think,,I have to say that I think,attitude towards China,is that of a kind of little Westerner mentality.,It's kind of arrogant.,It's arrogant in the sense,that we think that we are best,,and therefore we have the universal measure.,And secondly, it's ignorant.,We refuse to really address,the issue of difference.,You know, there's a very interesting passage,in a book by Paul Cohen, the American historian.,And Paul Cohen argues,that the West thinks of itself,as probably the most cosmopolitan,of all cultures.,But it's not.,In many ways,,it's the most parochial,,because for 200 years,,the West has been so dominant in the world,that it's not really needed,to understand other cultures,,other civilizations.,Because, at the end of the day,,it could, if necessary by force,,get its own way.,Whereas those cultures --,virtually the rest of the world, in fact,,which have been in a far weaker position, vis-a-vis the West --,have been thereby forced to understand the West,,because of the West's presence in those societies.,And therefore, they are, as a result,,more cosmopolitan in many ways than the West. 
 I mean, take the question of East Asia.,East Asia: Japan, Korea, China, etc. --,a third of the world's population lives there.,Now the largest economic region in the world.,And I'll tell you now,,that East Asianers, people from East Asia,,are far more knowledgeable,about the West,than the West is about East Asia.,Now this point is very germane, I'm afraid,,to the present.,Because what's happening? Back to that chart at the beginning,,the Goldman Sachs chart.,What is happening,is that, very rapidly in historical terms,,the world is being driven,and shaped,,not by the old developed countries,,but by the developing world.,We've seen this,in terms of the G20,usurping very rapidly the position of the G7,,or the G8.,And there are two consequences of this.,First, the West,is rapidly losing,its influence in the world.,There was a dramatic illustration of this actually a year ago --,Copenhagen, climate change conference.,Europe was not at the final negotiating table.,When did that last happen?,I would wager it was probably about 200 years ago.,And that is what is going to happen in the future. 
 And the second implication,is that the world will inevitably, as a consequence,,become increasingly unfamiliar to us,,because it'll be shaped by cultures and experiences and histories,that we are not really familiar with,,or conversant with.,And at last, I'm afraid -- take Europe;,America is slightly different --,but Europeans by and large, I have to say,,are ignorant,,are unaware,about the way the world is changing.,Some people -- I've got an English friend in China,,and he said, "The continent is sleepwalking into oblivion.",Well, maybe that's true,,maybe that's an exaggeration.,But there's another problem which goes along with this --,that Europe is increasingly out of touch with the world --,and that is a sort of,loss of a sense of the future.,I mean, Europe once, of course, once commanded the future,in its confidence.,Take the 19th century, for example.,But this, alas, is no longer true. 
 If you want to feel the future, if you want to taste the future,,try China -- there's old Confucius.,This is a railway station,the likes of which you've never seen before.,It doesn't even look like a railway station.,This is the new [Wuhan] railway station,for the high-speed trains.,China already has a bigger network,than any other country in the world,and will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together.,Or take this: now this is an idea,,but it's an idea to be tried out shortly,in a suburb of Beijing.,Here you have a megabus,,on the upper deck carries about 2,000 people.,It travels on rails,down a suburban road,,and the cars travel underneath it.,And it does speeds of up to about 100 miles an hour.,Now this is the way things are going to move,,because China has a very specific problem,,which is different from Europe,and different from the United States:,China has huge numbers of people and no space.,So this is a solution to a situation,where China's going to have,many, many, many cities,over 20 million people. 
 Okay, so how would I like to finish?,Well, what should our attitude be,towards this world,that we see,very rapidly developing,before us?,I think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it.,But I want to argue, above all,,a big-picture positive for this world.,For 200 years,,the world was essentially governed,by a fragment of the human population.,That's what Europe and North America represented.,The arrival of countries,like China and India --,between them 38 percent of the world's population --,and others like Indonesia and Brazil and so on,,represent the most important single act,of democratization,in the last 200 years.,Civilizations and cultures,,which had been ignored, which had no voice,,which were not listened to, which were not known about,,will have a different sort,of representation in this world.,As humanists, we must welcome, surely,,this transformation,,and we will have to learn,about these civilizations. 
 This big ship here,was the one sailed in by Zheng He,in the early 15th century,on his great voyages,around the South China Sea, the East China Sea,and across the Indian Ocean to East Africa.,The little boat in front of it,was the one in which, 80 years later,,Christopher Columbus crossed the Atlantic.,(Laughter),Or, look carefully,at this silk scroll,made by ZhuZhou,in 1368.,I think they're playing golf.,Christ, the Chinese even invented golf. 
 Welcome to the future. Thank you. 
 (Applause)There's a beautiful statementnon the screen that says,,"Light creates ambiance,nlight makes the feel of a space,,and light is alsonthe expression of structure.",Well, that was not by me.,That was, of course, by Le Corbusier,nthe famous architect.,And here you can see what he meantnin one of his beautiful buildings --,the chapel Notre Dame Du HautnDe Ronchamp --,where he creates this light that he couldnonly make because there's also dark.,And I think that is the quintessencenof this 18-minute talk --,that there is no good lightingnthat is healthy and for our well-being,without proper darkness. 
 So this is how we normallynwould light our offices.,We have codes and standards that tell usnthat the lights should be so much Lux,and of great uniformity.,This is how we create uniform lightingnfrom one wall to the other,in a regular grid of lamps.,And that is quite differentnfrom what I just showed you,from Le Corbusier.,If we would applynthese codes and standards,to the Pantheon in Rome,,it would never have looked like this,,because this beautiful light featurenthat goes around there all by itself,can only appear because there isnalso darkness in that same building.,And the same is more or lessnwhat Santiago Calatrava said,when he said, "Light: I make itnin my buildings for comfort.",And he didn't mean the comfortnof a five-course dinner,as opposed to a one-course meal,,but he really meant the comfort,of the quality of the buildingnfor the people.,He meant that you can see the skynand that you can experience the sun.,And he created these gorgeous buildingsnwhere you can see the sky,,and where you can experience the sun,,that give us a better lifenin the built environment,,just because of the relevance of lightnin its brightness and also in its shadows. 
 And what it all boils down to is,nof course, the sun.,And this image of the Sun may suggest,that the Sun is somethingnevil and aggressive,,but we should not forget,that all energy on this planetnactually comes from the Sun,,and light is onlyna manifestation of that energy. 
 The sun is for dynamics,nfor color changes.,The sun is for beauty in our environment,,like in this building --nthe High Museum in Atlanta,,which has been creatednby Renzo Piano from Italy,,together with Arup Lighting,na brilliant team of lighting designers,,who created a very subtlenmodulation of light across the space,,responding to what the sun does outside,,just because of all thesenbeautiful openings in the roof.,So in an indirect way,nyou can see the sun.,And what they did is they creatednan integral building element,to improve the quality of the spacenthat surrounds the visitors of the museum.,They created this shadenthat you can see here,,which actually covers the sun,,but opens up to the goodnlight from the sky.,And here you can see how they reallyncrafted a beautiful design process,with physical models,,with quantitativenas well as qualitative methods,,to come to a final solutionnthat is truly integrated,and completely holisticnwith the architecture.,They allowed themselvesna few mistakes along the way.,As you can see here,nthere's some direct light on the floor,,but they could easily figure outnwhere that comes from.,And they allow people in that buildingnto really enjoy the sun,,the good part of the sun. 
 And enjoying the sunncan be in many different ways, of course.,It can be just like this,,or maybe like this,nwhich is rather peculiar,,but this is in 1963 --,the viewing of a sun eclipsenin the United States.,And it's just a bit bright up there,,so these people have foundna very intriguing solution.,This is, I think, a very illustrativenimage of what I try to say --,that the beautiful dynamics of sun,nbringing these into the building,,creates a quality of our built environmentnthat truly enhances our lives.,And this is all about darkness,as much as it isnabout lightness, of course,,because otherwisenyou don't see these dynamics. 
 As opposed to the first office,that I showed younin the beginning of the talk,,this is a well-known office,nwhich is the Weidt Group.,They are in green energy consulting,nor something like that.,And they really practice what they preach,because this office doesn't havenany electric lighting at all.,It has only, on one side,nthis big, big glass window,that helps to let the sunlightnenter deep into the space,and create a beautiful quality therenand a great dynamic range.,So it can be very dim over there,nand you do your work,,and it can be very bright over there,nand you do your work.,But actually, the human eyenturns out to be remarkably adaptable,to all these different light conditionsnthat together create an environment,that is never boringnand that is never dull,,and therefore helps usnto enhance our lives. 
 I really owe a short introductionnof this man to you.,This is Richard Kellynwho was born 100 years ago,,which is the reason I bring him up now,nbecause it's kind of an anniversary year.,In the 1930s, Richard Kellynwas the first person to really describe,a methodology of modern lighting design.,And he coined three terms,,which are "focal glow,"n"ambient luminescence",and "play of the brilliants" --,three very distinctly differentnideas about light in architecture,that all togethernmake up this beautiful experience. 
 So to begin with, focal glow.,He meant something like this --,where the lightngives direction to the space,and helps you to get around.,Or something like this,,which is the lighting designnhe did for General Motors,,for the car showroom.,And you enter that space,,and you feel like,n"Wow! This is so impressive,",just because of this focal point,nthis huge light source in the middle.,To me, it is something from theater,,and I will get back to thatna little bit later.,It's the spotlight on the artistnthat helps you to focus.,It could also be the sunlightnthat breaks through the clouds,and lights up a patch of the land,,highlighting itncompared to the dim environment.,Or it can be in today's retail,nin the shopping environment --,lighting the merchandise and creatingnaccents that help you to get around. 
 Ambient luminescencenis something very different.,Richard Kelly saw itnas something infinite,,something without any focus,,something where all detailsnactually dissolve in infinity.,And I see it as a very comfortable kindnof light that really helps us to relax,and to contemplate.,It could also be something like this:,the National Museum of Science in London,,where this blue is embracingnall the exhibitions and galleries,in one large gesture. 
 And then finally,,Kelly's play of brilliants added to that,really some play, I think,nof the skyline of Hong Kong,,or perhaps the chandeliernin the opera house,,or in the theater here,,which is the decoration,nthe icing on the cake, something playful,,something that is just an additionnto the architectural environment,,I would say.,These three distinct elements, together,,make a lighting environmentnthat helps us to feel better.,And we can onlyncreate these out of darkness.,And I will explain that further.,And I guess that is somethingnthat Richard Kelly, here on the left,,was explainingnto Ludwig Mies van Der Rohe.,And behind them,nyou see that Seagram Building,that later turned into an iconnof modern lighting design. 
 Those times, there werensome early attempts,also for light therapy already.,You can see here a photo,from the United StatesnLibrary of Medicine,,where people are putnin the sun to get better.,It's a little bit of a different story,nthis health aspect of light,,than what I'm telling you today.,In today's modern medicine,,there is a real understanding of lightnin an almost biochemical way.,And there is the ideanthat, when we look at things,,it is the yellow lightnthat helps us the most,,that we are the most sensitive for.,But our circadian rhythms,,which are the rhythmsnthat help us to wake and sleep,and be alert and relaxednand so forth and so on,,they are much more triggerednby blue light.,And by modulating the amountnof blue in our environment,,we can help peoplento relax, or to be alert,,to fall asleep, or to stay awake. 
 And that is how, maybe in the near future,nlight can help hospitals,to make people better sooner,nrecover them quicker.,Maybe in the airplane,nwe can overcome jet lag like that.,Perhaps in school,nwe can help children to learn better,because they concentrate morenon their work.,And you can imaginena lot more applications.,But I would like to talk further,about the combinationnof light and darkness,as a quality in our life. 
 So light is, of course,nfor social interaction also --,to create relationshipsnwith all the features around us.,It is the place where we gather around,when we have to say somethingnto each other.,And it is all about this planet.,But when you look at this planet at night,,it looks like this.,And I think this is the most shockingnimage in my talk today.,Because all this light herengoes up to the sky.,It never reaches the groundnwhere it was meant for.,It never is to the benefit of people.,It only spoils the darkness.,So at a global scale, it looks like this.,And, I mean, that is quite amazing,nwhat you see here --,how much light goes up into the skynand never reaches the ground.,Because if we look at the Earthnthe way it should be,,it would be somethingnlike this very inspiring image,where darkness is for our imaginationnand for contemplation,and to help us to relate to everything. 
 The world is changing though,,and urbanizationnis a big driver of everything.,I took this photontwo weeks ago in Guangzhou,,and I realized that 10 years ago,,there was nothing like this,nof these buildings.,It was just a much smaller city,,and the pace of urbanizationnis incredible and enormous.,And we have to understandnthese main questions:,How do people moventhrough these new urban spaces?,How do they share their culture?,How do we tackle things like mobility?,And how can light help there?,Because the new technologies,,they seem to benin a really interesting position,to contribute to the solutionsnof urbanization,and to provide usnwith better environments. 
 It's not that long ago,that our lighting was just donenwith these kinds of lamps.,And of course,nwe had the metal-halide lamps,and fluorescent lampsnand things like that.,Now we have LED,,but here you see the latest one,nand you see how incredibly small it is.,And this is exactlynwhat offers us a unique opportunity,,because this tiny, tiny size allows us,to put the lightnwherever we really need it.,And we can actually leave it outnwhere it's not needed at all,and where we can preserve darkness.,So that is a really interestingnproposition, I think,,and a new way of lightingnthe architectural environment,with our well-being in mind.,The problem is, though, that I wantednto explain to you how this really works --,but I can have four of these on my finger,,so you would not be ablento really see them.,So I asked our laboratorynto do something about it,,and they said,n"Well, we can do something.",They created for menthe biggest LED in the world,especially for TEDx in Amsterdam. 
 So here it is.,It's the same thingnas you can see over there --,just 200 times bigger.,And I will very quicklynshow you how it works.,So just to explain.,Now, every LED that is madenthese days gives blue light.,Now, this is not very pleasantnand comfortable.,And for that reason,nwe cover the LED with a phosphor cap.,And the phosphor is excited by the blue,and makes the light whitenand warm and pleasant.,And then when you add the lens to that,,you can bundle the lightnand send it wherever you need it,without any need to spill any lightnto the sky or anywhere else.,So you can preserve the darknessnand make the light.,I just wanted to show that to younso you understand how this works. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 We can go further.,So we have to rethinknthe way we light our cities.,We have to think againnabout light as a default solution.,Why are all these motorwaysnpermanently lit?,Is it really needed?,Can we maybe be much more selective,and create better environmentsnthat also benefit from darkness?,Can we be much more gentle with light?,Like here -- this isna very low light level actually.,Can we engage people morenin the lighting projects that we create,,so they really wantnto connect with it, like here?,Or can we create simply sculptures,that are very inspiringnto be in and to be around?,And can we preserve the darkness?,Because to find a placenlike this today on Earth,is really very, very challenging.,And to find a starry sky like thisnis even more difficult. 
 Even in the oceans,nwe are creating a lot of light,that we could actually ban,also for animal lifento have a much greater well-being.,And it's known that migrating birds,nfor example, get very disoriented,because of these offshore platforms.,And we discovered thatnwhen we make those lights green,,the birds, they actually go the right way.,They are not disturbed anymore.,And it turns out once again,that spectral sensitivitynis very important here. 
 In all of these examples, I think,,we should start makingnthe light out of darkness,,and use the darkness as a canvas --nlike the visual artists do,,like Edward Hopper in this painting.,I think that there isna lot of suspense in this painting.,I think, when I see it,nI start to think, who are those people?,Where have they come from?nWhere are they going?,What just happened?,What will be happeningnin the next five minutes?,And it only embodiesnall these stories and all this suspense,because of the darkness and the light. 
 Edward Hopper was a real master,in creating the narrationnby working with light and dark.,And we can learn from that,and create more interestingnand inspiring architectural environments.,We can do that in commercialnspaces like this.,And you can still also go outside,and enjoy the greatest shownin the universe,,which is, of course, the universe itself.,So I give you this wonderful,ninformative image of the sky,,ranging from the inner city,,where you may see one or two starsnand nothing else,,all the way to the rural environments,,where you can enjoy this greatnand gorgeous and beautiful performance,of the constellations and the stars. 
 In architecture, it works just the same.,By appreciating the darknessnwhen you design the light,,you create much moreninteresting environments,that truly enhance our lives.,This is the most well-known example,nTadao Ando's Church of the Light.,But I also thinknof Peter Zumthor's spa in Vals,,where light and dark,nin very gentle combinations,,alter each other to define the space.,Or Richard MacCormac'snSouthwark tube station in London,,where you can really see the sky,neven though you are under the ground. 
 And finally, I want to point out,that a lot of this inspirationncomes from theater.,And I think it's fantasticnthat we are today experiencing TEDx,in a theater for the first time,because I think we really owento the theater a big thanks.,It wouldn't bensuch an inspiring scenography,without this theater.,And I think the theater is a placenwhere we truly enhance life with light. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)My students often ask me,n"What is sociology?",And I tell them it's the study of the waynin which human beings are shaped,by things that they don't see.,And they say, "So,nhow can I be a sociologist?,How can I understandnthose invisible forces?",And I say, "Empathy.,Start with empathy.,It all begins with empathy.,Take yourself out of your shoes,,put yourself into the shoesnof another person." 
 Here, I'll give you an example.,So I imagine my lifenif, a hundred years ago,,China had been the most powerfulnnation in the world,and they came to the United Statesnin search of coal.,And they found it, and, in fact,nthey found lots of it right here.,And pretty soon,nthey began shipping that coal,,ton by ton,,railcar by railcar, boatload by boatload,,back to China and elsewherenaround the world.,And they got fabulouslynwealthy in doing so.,And they built beautiful cities,all powered on that coal.,And back here in the United States,,we saw economic despair, deprivation.,This is what I saw.,I saw people struggling to get by,,not knowing what was whatnand what was next.,And I asked myself the question:,How is it possible that we couldnbe so poor here in the United States,,because coal is such a wealthynresource; it's so much money?,And I realize:,because the Chinese ingratiated themselves,with a small ruling classnhere in the United States,,who stole all of that moneynand all of that wealth for themselves.,And the rest of us,nthe vast majority of us,,struggle to get by.,And the Chinesengave this small ruling elite,loads of military weaponsnand sophisticated technology,in order to ensure that people like me,would not speak outnagainst this relationship.,Does this sound familiar? 
 And they did things like train Americansnto help protect the coal.,And everywhere, there werensymbols of the Chinese --,everywhere, a constant reminder.,And back in China,,what do they say in China?,Nothing! They don't talk about us.nThey don't talk about the coal.,If you ask them,,they'll say, "Well, you know,nwe need the coal.,I mean, come on, I'm not goingnto turn down my thermostat.,You can't expect that.",And so, I get angry, and I get pissed,,as do lots of average people.,And we fight back,nand it gets really ugly.,And the Chinese respondnin a very ugly way.,And before we know it,nthey send in the tanks,and they send in the troops.,And lots of people are dying.,And it's a very, very difficult situation. 
 Can you imagine what you would feel,if you were in my shoes?,Can you imaginenwalking out of this building,and seeing a tank sitting out there,,or a truck full of soldiers?,Just imagine what you would feel,nbecause you know why they're here;,you know what they're doing here.,And you just feel the angernand you feel the fear.,If you can, that's empathy.nThat's empathy.,You've left your shoes,nand you've stood in mine.,And you've got to feel that. 
 OK, so that's the warm-up.,That's the warm-up.,Now we're going to haventhe real radical experiment.,So, for the remainder of my talk,nwhat I want you to do,is put yourselves in the shoesnof an ordinary Arab Muslim,living in the Middle East --,in particular, in Iraq.,And so to help you,,perhaps you're a membernof this middle-class family in Baghdad.,What you want is the best for your kids.,You want your kids to have a better life.,And you watch the news, you pay attention.,You read the newspaper, you go downnto the coffee shop with your friends,,you read the newspapersnfrom around the world.,Sometimes you even watch satellite,nCNN, from the United States.,You have a sense of whatnthe Americans are thinking.,But really, you just wantna better life for yourself.,That's what you want.,You're Arab Muslim living in Iraq.,You want a better life for yourself. 
 So here, let me help you.,Let me help you with some thingsnthat you might be thinking.,Number one:,this incursion into your landnthese past 20 years and before --,the reason anyonenis interested in your land,,and particularlynthe United States, is oil.,It's all about oil; you know that,neverybody knows that.,People back in the United Statesnknow it's about oil.,It's because somebody elsenhas a design for your resource.,It's your resource --nit's not somebody else's.,It's your land; it's your resource.,Somebody else has a design for it.,And you know why they have a design?,You know why they haventheir eyes set on it?,Because they havenan entire economic system,that's dependentnon that oil -- foreign oil,,oil from other parts of the worldnthat they don't own. 
 And what else do you thinknabout these people?,The Americans, they're rich.,Come on, they live in big houses,nthey have big cars.,They all have blond hair,nblue eyes. They're happy.,You think that. It's not true, of course,nbut that's the media impression.,And that's what you get.,And they have big cities,,and the cities are all dependent on oil.,And back home, what do you see?,Poverty, despair, struggle.,Look, you don't live in a wealthy country.,I mean -- this is Iraq.,This is what you see.,You see people struggling to get by.,It's not easy; you see a lot of poverty.,And you feel something about this.,These people have designsnfor your resource,,and this is what you see? 
 Something else you seenthat you talk about --,Americans don't talknabout this, but you do --,there's this thing,nthis militarization of the world,,and it's centerednright in the United States.,And the United States is responsible,for almost one halfnof the world's military spending.,Four percent of the world's population!,And you feel it; you see it every day.,It's part of your life.,And you talk about it with your friends.,You read about it.,And back when Saddam Hussein was in power,,the Americans didn't carenabout his crimes.,When he was gassingnthe Kurds and gassing Iran,,they didn't care about it.,When oil was at stake,,somehow, suddenly, things mattered.,And what you see, something else:,the United States,,the hub of democracy around the world --,they don't seem to really be supportingndemocratic countries,all around the world.,There are a lot of countries,noil-producing countries,,that aren't very democratic,nbut supported by the United States.,That's odd. 
 Oh -- these incursions, these two wars,,the 10 years of sanctions,,the eight years of occupation,,the insurgency that's beennunleashed on your people,,the tens of thousands,nthe hundreds of thousands,of civilian deaths?,All because of oil.,You can't help but think that.,You talk about it.,It's in the forefrontnof your mind, always.,You say, "How is that possible?",And this man, he's everyman --,your grandfather, your uncle,,your father, your son, your neighbor,,your professor, your student.,Once a life of happiness and joy,and suddenly, pain and sorrow.,Everyone in your countrynhas been touched by the violence,,the bloodshed, the pain,nthe horror -- everybody.,Not a single person in your countrynhas not been touched. 
 But there's something else.,There's something else about these people,nthese Americans who are there.,There's something elsenabout them that you see,that they don't see themselves.,And what do you see? They're Christians!,They're Christians.,They worship the Christian God,nthey have crosses, they carry Bibles.,Their Bibles have a little insignia,that says "US Army" on them.,And their leaders, their leaders:,before they send their sons and daughtersnoff to war in your country --,and you know the reason --,before they send them off,,they go to a Christian church,nand they pray to their Christian God,,and they ask for protectionnand guidance from that god.,Why?,Well, obviously,nwhen people die in the war,,they are Muslims, they are Iraqis --nthey're not Americans.,You don't want Americans to die --n"Protect Our Troops.",And you feel something about that --,of course you do.,And they do wonderful things.,You read about it, you hear about it.,They're there to build schoolsnand help people.,That's what they want to do.,They do wonderful things,nbut they also do the bad things,,and you can't tell the difference. 
 And this guy, you get a guynlike Lt. Gen. William Boykin.,Here's a guy who saysnthat your god is a false god.,Your god's an idol;nhis god is the true god.,The solution to the problemnin the Middle East, according to him,,is to convert you all to Christianity --,just get rid of your religion.,And you know that.nAmericans don't read about this guy.,They don't know anythingnabout him, but you do.,You pass it around.nYou pass his words around.,I mean, this is serious. You're afraid.,He was one of the leading commandersnin the second invasion of Iraq.,And you're thinking,n"My God, if this guy is saying that,,then all the soldiersnmust be saying that.",And this word here --,George Bush called this war a crusade.,Man, the Americans,nthey're just like, "Ah, crusade.,Whatever. I don't know what that means.",You know what it means --nit's a holy war against Muslims.,Look, invade, subdue them,ntake their resources.,If they won't submit, kill them.,That's what this is about.,And you're thinking, "My God,nthese Christians are coming to kill us.",This is frightening.,You feel frightened.nOf course you feel frightened. 
 And this man, Terry Jones:,I mean here's a guynwho wants to burn Qurans, right?,And the Americans:n"Ah, he's a knucklehead.,He's a former hotel manager; he's gotnthree dozen members of his church ...",They laugh him off.,You don't laugh him off,nbecause in the context of everything else,,all the pieces fit.,Of course this is how Americans think.,So people all over the Middle East,nnot just in your country,,are protesting.,"He wants to burn Qurans, our holy book.,These Christians --nwho are these Christians?,They're so evil, they're so mean --nthis is what they're about?",This is what you're thinkingnas an Arab Muslim,,as an Iraqi.,Of course you're going to think this. 
 And then your cousin says,n"Hey coz, check out this website.,You've got to see this -- Bible Boot Camp.,These Christians are nuts!,They're training their little kidsnto be soldiers for Jesus.,They take little kidsnand run them through these things,till they teach themnhow to say, 'Sir! Yes, sir!',and things like 'grenade toss'nand 'weapons care and maintenance.',And go to the website --nit says 'US Army' right on it.,I mean, these Christians, they're nuts.,How can they do thisnto their little kids?",And you're reading this website.,And of course, Christiansnin the United States, or anybody,,says, "This is some little churchnin the middle of nowhere.",You don't know that.,For you, this is like, all Christians.,It's all over the Web: "Bible Boot Camp.",And look at this.,They even teach their kids --,they train them in the same waynthe US Marines train.,Isn't that interesting.,And it scares you, and it frightens you. 
 So these guys, you see them.,You see, I, Sam Richards --nI know who these guys are.,They're my students, my friends;nI know what they're thinking.,You don't know.,When you see them, they're something else.,They're something else.,That's what they are to you.,We don't see it that waynin the United States,,but you see it that way.,So here.,Of course, you've got it wrong.,You're generalizing. It's wrong.,You don't understand the Americans.,It's not a Christian invasion.,We're not just there for oil;nwe're there for lots of reasons.,You have it wrong. You've missed it.,And of course, most of youndon't support the insurgency;,you don't support killing Americans;,you don't support the terrorists.,Of course you don't. Very few people do.,But -- some of you do.,And this is a perspective.,OK. So now, here's what we're going to do. 
 Step outside of your shoesnthat you're in right now,,and step back into your normal shoes.,So everyone's back in the room. OK?,Now here comes the radical experiment.,So we're all back home.,This photo: this woman --,man, I feel her.,I feel her.,She's my sister,,my wife, my cousin, my neighbor.,She's anybody to me.,These guys standing there,neverybody in the photo --,I feel this photo, man.,So here's what I want you to do. 
 Let's go back to my firstnexample, of the Chinese.,I want you to go there.,It's all about coal, and the Chinesenare here in the United States.,What I want you to do is picture her,as a Chinese womannreceiving a Chinese flag,because her loved one has diednin America in the coal uprising.,And the soldiers are Chinese,,and everybody else is Chinese.,As an American, how do you feelnabout this picture?,What do you think about that scene? 
 OK, try this. Bring it back.,This is the scene here.,It's an American, American soldiers,,American woman who lostnher loved one in the Middle East,,in Iraq or Afghanistan.,Now, put yourself in the shoes,,go back to the shoesnof an Arab Muslim living in Iraq.,What are you feeling and thinkingnabout this photo,,about this woman? 
 OK,,now follow me on this,,because I'm taking a big risk here.,And so I'm going to invite younto take a risk with me.,These gentlemen here, they're insurgents.,They were caught by the American soldiers,ntrying to kill Americans.,And maybe they succeeded.nMaybe they succeeded.,Put yourself in the shoesnof the Americans who caught them.,Can you feel the rage?,Can you feel that you just wantnto take these guys,and wring their necks?,Can you go there?,It shouldn't be that difficult.,You just -- oh, man.,Now, put yourself in their shoes.,Are they brutal killers,or patriotic defenders?,Which one?,Can you feel their anger,,their fear,,their rage,at what has happened in their country?,Can you imagine that maybenone of them, in the morning,,bent down to their childnand hugged their child,and said, "Dear, I'll be back later.,I'm going out to defendnyour freedom, your lives.,I'm going out to look out for us,,the future of our country.",Can you imagine that?,Can you imagine saying that?,Can you go there?,What do you think they're feeling?,You see, that's empathy.,It's also understanding. 
 [understand] 
 Now, you might ask,,"OK, Sam, so why do youndo this sort of thing?,Why would you usenthis example of all examples?",And I say, because.,You're allowed to hate these people.,You're allowed to just hate themnwith every fiber of your being.,And if I can get younto step into their shoes,and walk an inch -- one tiny inch --,then imagine the kindnof sociological analysis,that you can do in all othernaspects of your life.,You can walk a mile,when it comes to understanding whynthat person's driving 40 miles per hour,in the passing lane;,or your teenage son;,or your neighbor who annoys younby cutting his lawn on Sunday mornings.,Whatever it is, you can go so far.,And this is what I tell my students:,step outside of your tiny, little world.,Step inside of the tiny,nlittle world of somebody else.,And then do it again,and do it again and do it again.,And suddenly, all these tiny,nlittle worlds,,they come together in this complex web.,And they build a big, complex world.,And suddenly, without realizing it,,you're seeing the world differently.,Everything has changed.,Everything in your life has changed.,And that's, of course, what this is about. 
 Attend to other lives,,other visions.,Listen to other people,,enlighten ourselves.,I'm not saying that I supportnthe terrorists in Iraq.,But as a sociologist, what I am saying is:,I understand.,And now perhaps -- perhaps -- you do, too. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm going to be talking to you,about how we can tap,a really underutilized resource in health care,,which is the patient,,or, as I like to use the scientific term,,people.,Because we are all patients, we are all people.,Even doctors are patients at some point.,So I want to talk about that,as an opportunity,that we really have failed to engage with very well in this country,and, in fact, worldwide.,If you want to get at the big part --,I mean from a public health level, where my training is --,you're looking at behavioral issues.,You're looking at things where people are actually given information,,and they're not following through with it.,It's a problem that manifests itself in diabetes,,obesity, many forms of heart disease,,even some forms of cancer -- when you think of smoking.,Those are all behaviors where people know what they're supposed to do.,They know what they're supposed to be doing,,but they're not doing it. 
 Now behavior change is something,that is a long-standing problem in medicine.,It goes all the way back to Aristotle.,And doctors hate it, right?,I mean, they complain about it all the time.,We talk about it in terms of engagement, or non-compliance.,When people don't take their pills,,when people don't follow doctors' orders --,these are behavior problems.,But for as much as clinical medicine,agonizes over behavior change,,there's not a lot of work done,in terms of trying to fix that problem.,So the crux of it,comes down to this notion of decision-making --,giving information to people in a form,that doesn't just educate them,or inform them,,but actually leads them to make better decisions,,better choices in their lives. 
 One part of medicine, though,,has faced the problem of behavior change pretty well,,and that's dentistry.,Dentistry might seem -- and I think it is --,many dentists would have to acknowledge,it's somewhat of a mundane backwater of medicine.,Not a lot of cool, sexy stuff happening in dentistry.,But they have really taken this problem of behavior change,and solved it.,It's the one great preventive health success,we have in our health care system.,People brush and floss their teeth.,They don't do it as much as they should, but they do it. 
 So I'm going to talk about one experiment,that a few dentists in Connecticut,cooked up about 30 years ago.,So this is an old experiment, but it's a really good one,,because it was very simple,,so it's an easy story to tell.,So these Connecticut dentists decided,that they wanted to get people to brush their teeth and floss their teeth more often,,and they were going to use one variable:,they wanted to scare them.,They wanted to tell them how bad it would be,if they didn't brush and floss their teeth.,They had a big patient population.,They divided them up into two groups.,They had a low-fear population,,where they basically gave them a 13-minute presentation,,all based in science,,but told them that, if you didn't brush and floss your teeth,,you could get gum disease. If you get gum disease, you will lose your teeth,,but you'll get dentures, and it won't be that bad.,So that was the low-fear group.,The high-fear group, they laid it on really thick.,They showed bloody gums.,They showed puss oozing out from between their teeth.,They told them that their teeth were going to fall out.,They said that they could have infections,that would spread from their jaws to other parts of their bodies,,and ultimately, yes, they would lose their teeth.,They would get dentures, and if you got dentures,,you weren't going to be able to eat corn-on-the-cob,,you weren't going to be able to eat apples,,you weren't going to be able to eat steak.,You'll eat mush for the rest of your life.,So go brush and floss your teeth.,That was the message. That was the experiment. 
 Now they measured one other variable.,They wanted to capture one other variable,,which was the patients' sense of efficacy.,This was the notion of whether the patients felt,that they actually would go ahead and brush and floss their teeth.,So they asked them at the beginning,,"Do you think you'll actually be able to stick with this program?",And the people who said, "Yeah, yeah. I'm pretty good about that,",they were characterized as high efficacy,,and the people who said,,"Eh, I never get around to brushing and flossing as much as I should,",they were characterized as low efficacy.,So the upshot was this.,The upshot of this experiment,was that fear was not really a primary driver,of the behavior at all.,The people who brushed and flossed their teeth,were not necessarily the people,who were really scared about what would happen --,it's the people who simply felt that they had the capacity,to change their behavior.,So fear showed up as not really the driver.,It was the sense of efficacy. 
 So I want to isolate this,,because it was a great observation --,30 years ago, right, 30 years ago --,and it's one that's laid fallow in research.,It was a notion that really came out,of Albert Bandura's work,,who studied whether,people could get a sense of empowerment.,The notion of efficacy basically boils down to one -- that,if somebody believes that they have the capacity to change their behavior.,In health care terms, you could characterize this,as whether or not somebody feels,that they see a path towards better health,,that they can actually see their way towards getting better health,,and that's a very important notion.,It's an amazing notion.,We don't really know how to manipulate it, though, that well.,Except, maybe we do. 
 So fear doesn't work, right? Fear doesn't work.,And this is a great example,of how we haven't learned that lesson at all.,This is a campaign from the American Diabetes Association.,This is still the way we're communicating messages about health.,I mean, I showed my three-year-old this slide last night,,and he's like, "Papa, why is an ambulance in these people's homes?",And I had to explain, "They're trying to scare people.",And I don't know if it works. 
 Now here's what does work:,personalized information works.,Again, Bandura recognized this,years ago, decades ago.,When you give people specific information,about their health, where they stand,,and where they want to get to, where they might get to,,that path, that notion of a path --,that tends to work for behavior change.,So let me just spool it out a little bit.,So you start with personalized data, personalized information,that comes from an individual,,and then you need to connect it to their lives.,You need to connect it to their lives,,hopefully not in a fear-based way, but one that they understand.,Okay, I know where I sit. I know where I'm situated.,And that doesn't just work for me in terms of abstract numbers --,this overload of health information,that we're inundated with.,But it actually hits home.,It's not just hitting us in our heads; it's hitting us in our hearts.,There's an emotional connection to information,because it's from us.,That information then needs to be connected to choices,,needs to be connected to a range of options,,directions that we might go to --,trade-offs, benefits.,Finally, we need to be presented with a clear point of action.,We need to connect the information,always with the action,,and then that action feeds back,into different information,,and it creates, of course, a feedback loop. 
 Now this is a very well-observed and well-established notion,for behavior change.,But the problem is that things -- in the upper-right corner there --,personalized data, it's been pretty hard to come by.,It's a difficult and expensive commodity,,until now.,So I'm going to give you an example, a very simple example of how this works.,So we've all seen these. These are the "your speed limit" signs.,You've seen them all around,,especially these days as radars are cheaper.,And here's how they work in the feedback loop.,So you start with the personalized data,where the speed limit on the road that you are at that point,is 25,,and, of course, you're going faster than that.,We always are. We're always going above the speed limit.,The choice in this case is pretty simple.,We either keep going fast, or we slow down.,We should probably slow down,,and that point of action is probably now.,We should take our foot off the pedal right now,,and generally we do. These things are shown to be pretty effective,in terms of getting people to slow down.,They reduce speeds by about five to 10 percent.,They last for about five miles,,in which case we put our foot back on the pedal.,But it works, and it even has some health repercussions.,Your blood pressure might drop a little bit.,Maybe there's fewer accidents, so there's public health benefits. 
 But by and large, this is a feedback loop,that's so nifty and too rare.,Because in health care, most health care,,the data is very removed from the action.,It's very difficult to line things up so neatly.,But we have an opportunity.,So I want to talk about, I want to shift now to think about,how we deliver health information in this country,,how we actually get information.,This is a pharmaceutical ad.,Actually, it's a spoof. It's not a real pharmaceutical ad.,Nobody's had the brilliant idea,of calling their drug Havidol quite yet.,But it looks completely right.,So it's exactly the way we get,health information and pharmaceutical information,,and it just sounds perfect.,And then we turn the page of the magazine,,and we see this --,now this is the page the FDA requires pharmaceutical companies,to put into their ads, or to follow their ads,,and to me, this is one of the most ncynical exercises in medicine.,Because we know.,Who among us would actually say that people read this?,And who among us would actually say,that people who do try to read this,actually get anything out of it?,This is a bankrupt effort,at communicating health information.,There is no good faith in this. 
 So this is a different approach.,This is an approach that has been developed,by a couple researchers at Dartmouth Medical School,,Lisa Schwartz and Steven Woloshin.,And they created this thing called the "drug facts box.",They took inspiration from, of all things,,Cap'n Crunch.,They went to the nutritional information box,and saw that what works for cereal, works for our food,,actually helps people understand what's in their food.,God forbid we should use that same standard,that we make Cap'n Crunch live by,and bring it to drug companies.,So let me just walk through this quickly.,It says very clearly what the drug is for, specifically who it is good for,,so you can start to personalize your understanding,of whether the information is relevant to you,or whether the drug is relevant to you.,You can understand exactly what the benefits are.,It isn't this kind of vague promise that it's going to work no matter what,,but you get the statistics for how effective it is.,And finally, you understand what those choices are.,You can start to unpack the choices involved,because of the side effects.,Every time you take a drug, you're walking into a possible side effect.,So it spells those out in very clean terms,,and that works. 
 So I love this. I love that drug facts box.,And so I was thinking about,,what's an opportunity that I could have,to help people understand information?,What's another latent body of information that's out there,that people are really not putting to use?,And so I came up with this: lab test results.,Blood test results are this great source of information.,They're packed with information.,They're just not for us. They're not for people. They're not for patients.,They go right to doctors.,And God forbid -- I think many doctors, if you really asked them,,they don't really understand all this stuff either.,This is the worst presented information.,You ask Tufte, and he would say,,"Yes, this is the absolute worst presentation of information possible." 
 What we did at Wired,was we went, and I got our graphic design department,to re-imagine these lab reports.,So that's what I want to walk you through.,So this is the general blood work before,,and this is the after, this is what we came up with.,The after takes what was four pages --,that previous slide was actually,the first of four pages of data,that's just the general blood work.,It goes on and on and on, all these values, all these numbers you don't know.,This is our one-page summary.,We use the notion of color.,It's an amazing notion that color could be used.,So on the top-level you have your overall results,,the things that might jump out at you from the fine print.,Then you can drill down,and understand how actually we put your level in context,,and we use color to illustrate,exactly where your value falls.,In this case, this patient is slightly at risk of diabetes,because of their glucose level. 
 Likewise, you can go over your lipids,and, again, understand what your overall cholesterol level is,and then break down into the HDL and the LDL if you so choose.,But again, always using color,and personalized proximity,to that information.,All those other values,,all those pages and pages of values that are full of nothing,,we summarize.,We tell you that you're okay, you're normal.,But you don't have to wade through it. You don't have to go through the junk.,And then we do two other very important things,that kind of help fill in this feedback loop:,we help people understand in a little more detail,what these values are and what they might indicate.,And then we go a further step -- we tell them what they can do.,We give them some insight,into what choices they can make, what actions they can take.,So that's our general blood work test. 
 Then we went to CRP test.,In this case, it's a sin of omission.,They have this huge amount of space,,and they don't use it for anything, so we do.,Now the CRP test is often done,following a cholesterol test,,or in conjunction with a cholesterol test.,So we take the bold step,of putting the cholesterol information on the same page,,which is the way the doctor is going to evaluate it.,So we thought the patient might actually want to know the context as well.,It's a protein that shows up,when your blood vessels might be inflamed,,which might be a risk for heart disease.,What you're actually measuring,is spelled out in clean language.,Then we use the information,that's already in the lab report.,We use the person's age and their gender,to start to fill in the personalized risks.,So we start to use the data we have,to run a very simple calculation,that's on all sorts of online calculators,to get a sense of what the actual risk is. 
 The last one I'll show you is a PSA test.,Here's the before, and here's the after.,Now a lot of our effort on this one --,as many of you probably know,,a PSA test is a very controversial test.,It's used to test for prostate cancer,,but there are all sorts of reasons,why your prostate might be enlarged.,And so we spent a good deal of our time,indicating that.,We again personalized the risks.,So this patient is in their 50s,,so we can actually give them a very precise estimate,of what their risk for prostate cancer is.,In this case it's about 25 percent, based on that.,And then again, the follow-up actions. 
 So our cost for this was less than 10,000 dollars, all right.,That's what Wired magazine spent on this.,Why is Wired magazine doing this?,(Laughter),Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp,,the two largest lab testing companies --,last year, they made profits of over 700 million dollars,and over 500 million dollars respectively.,Now this is not a problem of resources;,this is a problem of incentives.,We need to recognize that the target of this information,should not be the doctor, should not be the insurance company.,It should be the patient.,It's the person who actually, in the end,,is going to be having to change their lives,and then start adopting new behaviors. 
 This is information that is incredibly powerful.,It's an incredibly powerful catalyst to change.,But we're not using it. It's just sitting there.,It's being lost.,So I want to just offer four questions,that every patient should ask,,because I don't actually expect people,to start developing these lab test reports.,But you can create your own feedback loop.,Anybody can create their feedback loop by asking these simple questions:,Can I have my results?,And the only acceptable answer is --,(Audience: Yes.) -- yes.,What does this mean? Help me understand what the data is.,What are my options? What choices are now on the table?,And then, what's next?,How do I integrate this information,into the longer course of my life? 
 So I want to wind up by just showing,that people have the capacity to understand this information.,This is not beyond the grasp of ordinary people.,You do not need to have the education level of people in this room.,Ordinary people are capable of understanding this information,,if we only go to the effort of presenting it to them,in a form that they can engage with.,And engagement is essential here,,because it's not just giving them information;,it's giving them an opportunity to act.,That's what engagement is. It's different from compliance.,It works totally different from the way we talk about behavior,in medicine today.,And this information is out there. 
 I've been talking today about latent information,,all this information that exists in the system,that we're not putting to use.,But there are all sorts of other bodies of information,that are coming online,,and we need to recognize the capacity of this information,to engage people, to help people,and to change the course of their lives. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)(Applause) 
 Thank you very much.,I have a few pictures,,and I'll talk a little bitnabout how I'm able to do what I do.,All these houses are built,from between 70 and 80 percentnrecycled material,,stuff that was headed to the mulcher,nthe landfill, the burn pile.,It was all just gone.,This is the first house I built.,This double front door herenwith the three-light transom,,that was headed to the landfill.,Have a little turret there.,And then these buttonsnon the corbels here --,right there --,those are hickory nuts.,And these buttons there --,those are chicken eggs. 
 (Laughter) 
 Of course, first you have breakfast,,and then you fill the shell fullnof Bondo and paint it and nail it up,,and you have an architectural buttonnin just a fraction of the time. 
 This is a look at the inside.,You can see the three-light transomnthere with the eyebrow windows.,Certainly an architectural antiquenheaded to the landfill --,even the locksetnis probably worth 200 dollars.,Everything in the kitchen was salvaged.,There's a 1952 O'Keefe & Merritt stove,,if you like to cook -- cool stove.,This is going up into the turret.,I got that staircase for 20 dollars,,including delivery to my lot. 
 (Laughter) 
 Then, looking up in the turret,,you see there are bulgesnand pokes and sags and so forth.,Well, if that ruins your life,,well, then, you shouldn't live there. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is a laundry chute.,And this right here is a shoe last --,those are those cast-iron thingsnyou see at antique shops.,So I had one of those,,so I made some low-tech gadgetry,nwhere you just stomp on the shoe last,,and then the door flies opennand you throw your laundry down.,And then if you're smart enough,nit goes on a basket on top of the washer.,If not, it goes into the toilet. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is a bathtub I made,,made out of scrap two-by-four.,Started with the rim, and then gluednand nailed it up into a flat,,corbeled it up and flipped it over,,then did the two profiles on this side.,It's a two-person tub.,After all, it's not justna question of hygiene,,but there's a possibilitynof recreation as well. 
 (Laughter) 
 Then, this faucet herenis just a piece of Osage orange.,It looks a little phallic,,but after all, it's a bathroom. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is a house based on a Budweiser can.,It doesn't look like a can of beer,,but the design take-offsnare absolutely unmistakable:,the barley hops designnworked up into the eaves,,then the dentil work comes directlynoff the can's red, white, blue and silver.,Then, these corbels goingndown underneath the eaves,are that little designnthat comes off the can.,I just put a can on a copiernand kept enlarging it,until I got the size I want.,Then, on the can it says,,"This is the famous Budweiser beer,,we know of no other beer,nblah, blah, blah.",So we changed that and put,,"This is the famous Budweiser house.nWe don't know of any other house ...",and so forth and so on.,This is a deadbolt.,It's a fence from a 1930s shaper,nwhich is a very angry woodworking machine.,And they gave me the fence,nbut they didn't give me the shaper,,so we made a deadbolt out of it.,That'll keep bull elephantsnout, I promise. 
 (Laughter) 
 And sure enough, we've hadnno problems with bull elephants. 
 (Laughter) 
 The shower is intendednto simulate a glass of beer.,We've got bubbles going up there,nthen suds at the top with lumpy tiles.,Where do you get lumpy tiles?nWell, of course, you don't.,But I get a lot of toilets, and so younjust dispatch a toilet with a hammer,,and then you have lumpy tiles.,And then the faucet is a beer tap. 
 (Laughter) 
 Then, this panel of glassnis the same panel of glass,that occurs in every middle-classnfront door in America.,We're getting tired of it.nIt's kind of clichéd now.,If you put it in the front door,nyour design fails.,So don't put it in the front door;nput it somewhere else.,It's a pretty panel of glass.,But if you put it in the front door,,people say, "Oh, you're tryingnto be like those guys,,and you didn't make it.",So don't put it there.,Then, another bathroom upstairs.,This light up here,is the same light that occursnin every middle-class foyer in America.,Don't put it in the foyer.,Put it in the shower, or in the closet,,but not in the foyer.,Then, somebody gave mena bidet, so it got a bidet. 
 (Laughter) 
 This little house here,,those branches there are madenout of Bois d'arc or Osage orange.,These pictures will keep scrollingnas I talk a little bit. 
 In order to do what I do,,you have to understand what causesnwaste in the building industry.,Our housing has become a commodity,,and I'll talk a little bit about that.,But the first cause of wastenis probably even buried in our DNA.,Human beings have a neednfor maintaining consistency,of the apperceptive mass.,What does that mean?,What it means is,nfor every perception we have,,it needs to tallynwith the one like it before,,or we don't have continuity,nand we become a little bit disoriented.,So I can show you an objectnyou've never seen before.,Oh, that's a cell phone.,But you've never seen this one before.,What you're doing,is sizing up the patternnof structural features,,and then you go through your databanks:,Cell phone. Oh! That's a cell phone.,If I took a bite out of it, you'd go,,"Wait a second. 
 (Laughter) 
 "That's not a cell phone.,That's one of those newnchocolate cell phones." 
 (Laughter) 
 You'd have to start a new category,,right between cell phones and chocolate. 
 (Laughter) 
 That's how we process information. 
 You translate thatnto the building industry.,If we have a wall of windowpanesnand one pane is cracked, we go,,"Oh, dear. That's cracked.nLet's repair it.,Let's take it out and throw it awaynso nobody can use it,and put a new one in.",Because that's what you donwith a cracked pane.,Never mind that it doesn'tnaffect our lives at all.,It only rattles that expected patternnand unity of structural features.,However, if we took a small hammer,,and we added cracksnto all the other windows -- 
 (Laughter) 
 then we have a pattern.,Because Gestalt psychologynemphasizes recognition of pattern,over parts that comprise a pattern.,We'll go, "Ooh, that's nice.",So, that serves me every day.,Repetition creates pattern.,If I have 100 of these, 100 of those,,it makes no differencenwhat these and those are.,If I can repeat anything,nI have the possibility of a pattern,,from hickory nuts and chicken eggs,nshards of glass, branches.,It doesn't make any difference.,That causes a lot of wastenin the building industry. 
 The second cause is,,Friedrich Nietzsche, along about 1885,,wrote a book titledn"The Birth of Tragedy.",And in there,,he said cultures tend to swingnbetween one of two perspectives:,on the one hand,nwe have an Apollonian perspective,,which is very crisp and premeditatednand intellectualized,and perfect.,On the other end of the spectrum,nwe have a Dionysian perspective,,which is more givennto the passions and intuition,,tolerant of organic texturenand human gesture.,So the way the Apollonian personalityntakes a picture or hangs a picture is,,they'll get out a transit,and a laser level,and a micrometer.,"OK, honey. A thousandthnof an inch to the left.,That's where we wantnthe picture. Right. Perfect!",Predicated on plumb level,nsquare and centered.,The Dionysian personalityntakes the picture and goes: 
 (Laughter) 
 That's the difference.,I feature blemish.,I feature organic process.,Dead center John Dewey.,Apollonian mindsetncreates mountains of waste.,If something isn't perfect,,if it doesn't line upnwith that premeditated model?,Dumpster.,"Oops. Scratch. Dumpster.","Oops" this, "oops" that.nLandfill, landfill, landfill. 
 The third thing is arguably --,The Industrial Revolutionnstarted in the Renaissance,with the rise of humanism,,then got a little jump startnalong about the French Revolution.,By the middle of the 19th century,nit's in full flower.,And we have dumaflaches and gizmos,and contraptions that will do anything,that we, up to that point,,had to do by hand.,So now we have standardized materials.,Well, trees don't growntwo inches by four inches,,eight, ten and twelve feet tall. 
 (Laughter) 
 We create mountains of waste.,And they're doing a pretty good jobnthere in the forest,,working all the byproductnof their industry --,with OSB and particle boardnand so forth and so on --,but it does no good,to be responsible at the pointnof harvest in the forest,if consumers are wasting the harvestnat the point of consumption.,And that's what's happening.,And so if something isn't standard,,"Oops, dumpster." "Oops" this.n"Oops, warped.",If you buy a two-by-fournand it's not straight,,you can take it back.,"Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.nWe'll get you a straight one.",Well, I feature all those warped things,because repetition creates pattern,,and it's from a Dionysian perspective. 
 The fourth thing,is labor is disproportionatelynmore expensive than materials.,Well, that's just a myth.,And there's a story:,Jim Tulles, one of the guys I trained --nI said, "Jim, it's time now.,I got a job for you as a foremannon a framing crew. Time for you to go.","Dan, I just don't think I'm ready.","Jim, now it's time.nYou're the down -- oh!",So we hired on.,And he was out there with a tape measure,ngoing through the trash heap,,looking for header material,nor the board that goes over a door,,thinking he'd impress his boss --nthat's how we taught him to do it.,The superintendent walked upnand said, "What are you doing?","Oh, just looking for header material,",waiting for that kudos.,He said, "I'm not paying you to gonthrough the trash. Get back to work.",And Jim had the wherewithal to say,,"You know, if you were paying men300 dollars an hour,,I can see how you might say that.,But right now, I'm saving younfive dollars a minute.,Do the math." 
 (Laughter) 
 "Good call, Tulles. From now on,nyou guys hit this pile first.",And the irony is that he wasn'tnvery good at math. 
 (Laughter) 
 But once in a while,nyou get access to the control room,,and then you cannkind of mess with the dials.,And that's what happened there. 
 The fifth thing is that maybe,nafter 2,500 years,,Plato is still having his way with usnin his notion of perfect forms.,He said that we have in our nogginnthe perfect idea of what we want,,and we force environmentalnresources to accommodate that.,So we all have in our headnthe perfect house,,the American dream, which is a house,,the dream house.,The problem is we can't afford it.,So we have the American dream look-alike,,which is a mobile home.,Now there's a blight on the planet. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's a chattel mortgage,,just like furniture, just like a car.,You write the check,nand instantly, it depreciates 30 percent.,After a year, you can't get insurancenon everything you have in it,,only on 70 percent.,Wired with 14-Gauge wire, typically.,Nothing wrong with that,,unless you ask it to donwhat 12-Gauge wire's supposed to do,,and that's what happens.,It out-gasses formaldehyde --,so much so that there isna federal law in place,to warn new mobile home buyersnof the formaldehyde atmosphere danger.,Are we just being numbingly stupid?,The walls are this thick.,The whole thing hasnthe structural value of corn. 
 (Laughter) 
 "So ... I thought Palm HarbornVillage was over there.","No, no. We had a wind last night.,It's gone now." 
 (Laughter) 
 Then when they degrade,nwhat do you do with them? 
 Now, all that --,that Apollonian, Platonic model --,is what the building industrynis predicated on,,and there are a number of thingsnthat exacerbate that.,One is that all the professionals,,all the tradesmen, vendors,,inspectors, engineers, architects,all think like this.,And then it works its waynback to the consumer,,who demands the same model.,It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.nWe can't get out of it.,Then here come the marketeersnand the advertisers.,"Woo. Woo-hoo.",We buy stuff we didn't know we needed.,All we have to donis look at what one company did,with carbonated prune juice.,How disgusting. 
 (Laughter) 
 But you know what they did?,They hooked a metaphor into itnand said, "I drink Dr. Pepper ...",And pretty soon, we're swillingnthat stuff by the lake-ful,,by the billions of gallons.,It doesn't even have real prunes!nDoesn't even keep you regular. 
 (Laughter) 
 My oh my, that makes it worse.,And we get suckedninto that faster than anything. 
 Then, a man namednJean-Paul Sartre wrote a book,titled "Being and Nothingness.",It's a pretty quick read.nYou can snap through it in maybe -- 
 (Laughter) 
 maybe two years,,if you read eight hours a day.,In there, he talkednabout the divided self.,He said human beings act differentlynwhen they know they're alone,than when they knownsomebody else is around.,So if I'm eating spaghetti,nand I know I'm alone,,I can eat like a backhoe.,I can wipe my mouth on my sleeve,nnapkin on the table,,chew with my mouth open,nmake little noises,,scratch wherever I want. 
 (Laughter) 
 But as soon as you walk in,,I go, "Oops! Lil' spaghetti sauce there.",Napkin in my lap, half-bites,,chew with my mouth closed, no scratching.,Now, what I'm doingnis fulfilling your expectations,of how I should live my life.,I feel that expectation,,and so I accommodate it,,and I'm living my life accordingnto what you expect me to do.,That happens in the buildingnindustry as well.,That's why all subdivisions look the same.,Sometimes, we even haventhese formalized cultural expectations.,I'll bet all your shoes match.,Sure enough, we all buy into that ... 
 (Laughter) 
 And with gated communities,,we have a formalized expectation,,with a homeowners' association.,Sometimes those guys are Nazis,,my oh my.,That exacerbates and continues this model. 
 The last thing is gregariousness.,Human beings are a social species.,We like to hang together in groups,,just like wildebeests, just like lions.,Wildebeests don't hang with lions,,because lions eat wildebeests.,Human beings are like that.,We do what that group does,that we're trying to identify with.,You see this in junior high a lot.,Those kids, they'll worknall summer long -- kill themselves --,so that they can affordnone pair of designer jeans.,So along about September,,they can stride in and go,,"I'm important today. See?nDon't touch my designer jeans!,I see you don't have designer jeans.,You're not one of the beautiful --nSee, I'm one of the beautiful people.,See my jeans?",Right there is reasonnenough to have uniforms.,And so that happensnin the building industry as well. 
 We have confusednMaslow's hierarchy of needs,,just a little bit.,On the bottom tier, we have basic needs:,shelter, clothing, food,nwater, mating and so forth.,Second: security. Third: relationships.,Fourth: status, self-esteem --nthat is, vanity --,and we're taking vanitynand shoving it down here.,And so we end up,with vain decisions,,and we can't even afford our mortgage.,We can't afford to eatnanything except beans; 
 that is, our housingnhas become a commodity.,And it takes a little bit of nerve,to dive into those primal,,terrifying parts of ourselves,and make our own decisions,and not make our housing a commodity,,but make it somethingnthat bubbles up from seminal sources.,That takes a little bit of nerve,,and, darn it, once in a while, you fail.,But that's okay.,If failure destroys you,,then you can't do this.,I fail all the time, every day,,and I've had some whoppingnfailures, I promise --,big, public, humiliating,nembarrassing failures. 
 Everybody points and laughs,,and they say, "He tried it a fifth time,nand it still didn't work!,What a moron!",Early on, contractors come by and say,,"Dan, you're a cute little bunny,,but you know,nthis just isn't going to work.,What don't you do this?nWhy don't you do that?",And your instinct is to say,,"Well, why don't you suck an egg?" 
 (Laughter) 
 But you don't say that,,because they're the guys you're targeting. 
 And so what we've done --,and this isn't just in housing;nit's in clothing and food,and our transportationnneeds, our energy --,we sprawl just a little bit.,And when I get a little bit of press,,I hear from people all over the world.,And we may have invented excess,,but the problem of waste is worldwide.,We're in trouble.,And I don't wear ammo beltsncrisscrossing my chest,and a red bandana.,But we're clearly in trouble.,And what we need to do is reconnect,with those really primalnparts of ourselves,and make some decisions and say,,"You know, I think I would like to putnCDs across the wall there.,What do you think, honey?",If it doesn't work, take it down.,What we need to do is reconnectnwith who we really are,,and that's thrilling indeed. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I want you to take a look at this baby.,What you're drawn to are her eyesnand the skin you love to touch.,But today I'm going to talk to younabout something you can't see.,What's going onnup in that little brain of hers.,The modern tools of neurosciencenare demonstrating to us,that what's going on up therenis nothing short of rocket science.,And what we're learningnis going to shed some light,on what the romantic writers and poetsndescribed as the "celestial openness",of the child's mind. 
 What we see here is a mother in India,,and she's speaking Koro,nwhich is a newly discovered language.,And she's talking to her baby.,What this mother --,and the 800 people who speaknKoro in the world --,understands is that,nto preserve this language,,they need to speak it to the babies.,And therein lies a critical puzzle.,Why is it that you can'tnpreserve a language,by speaking to you and I, to the adults?,Well, it's got to do with your brain.,What we see here is that languagenhas a critical period for learning.,The way to read this slide is to looknat your age on the horizontal axis. 
 (Laughter) 
 And you'll see on the verticalnyour skill at acquiring a second language.,The babies and children are geniusesnuntil they turn seven,,and then there's a systematic decline.,After puberty, we fall off the map.,No scientists dispute this curve,,but laboratories all over the world,are trying to figure outnwhy it works this way. 
 Work in my lab is focused on the firstncritical period in development,,and that is the period in which babies,try to master which soundsnare used in their language.,We think, by studyingnhow the sounds are learned,,we'll have a modelnfor the rest of language,,and perhaps for critical periodsnthat may exist in childhood,for social, emotionalnand cognitive development.,So we've been studying the babies,using a techniquenthat we're using all over the world,and the sounds of all languages.,The baby sits on a parent's lap,,and we train them to turnntheir heads when a sound changes --,like from "ah" to "ee.",If they do so at the appropriate time,nthe black box lights up,and a panda bear pounds a drum.,A six-monther adores the task. 
 What have we learned?,Well, babies all over the world,are what I like to describenas "citizens of the world.",They can discriminatenall the sounds of all languages,,no matter what country we're testingnand what language we're using,,and that's remarkablenbecause you and I can't do that.,We're culture-bound listeners.,We can discriminate the soundsnof our own language,,but not those of foreign languages.,So the question arises:nWhen do those citizens of the world,turn into the language-boundnlisteners that we are?,And the answer:nbefore their first birthdays.,What you see here is performancenon that head-turn task,for babies tested in Tokyonand the United States,,here in Seattle,,as they listened to "ra" and "la" --,sounds important to English,nbut not to Japanese.,So at six to eight months,nthe babies are totally equivalent.,Two months later,nsomething incredible occurs.,The babies in the United Statesnare getting a lot better,,babies in Japan are getting a lot worse,,but both of those groups of babiesnare preparing for exactly the language,that they are going to learn. 
 So the question is: What's happeningnduring this critical two-month period?,This is the critical periodnfor sound development,,but what's going on up there?,So there are two things going on.,The first is that the babiesnare listening intently to us,,and they're taking statisticsnas they listen to us talk --,they're taking statistics.,So listen to two mothersnspeaking motherese --,the universal languagenwe use when we talk to kids --,first in English and then in Japanese. 
 (Video) Ah, I love your big blue eyes --,so pretty and nice. 
 (Japanese) 
 Patricia Kuhl: During the productionnof speech, when babies listen,,what they're doing is taking statisticsnon the language that they hear.,And those distributions grow.,And what we've learned is that babiesnare sensitive to the statistics,,and the statistics of Japanesenand English are very, very different.,English has a lot of Rs and Ls.,The distribution shows.,And the distribution of Japanesenis totally different,,where we see a groupnof intermediate sounds,,which is known as the Japanese "R.",So babies absorbnthe statistics of the language,and it changes their brains;,it changes themnfrom the citizens of the world,to the culture-boundnlisteners that we are.,But we as adults are no longernabsorbing those statistics.,We are governednby the representations in memory,that were formed early in development. 
 So what we're seeing here,is changing our modelsnof what the critical period is about.,We're arguing fromna mathematical standpoint,that the learning of languagenmaterial may slow down,when our distributions stabilize.,It's raising lots of questionsnabout bilingual people.,Bilinguals must keep two setsnof statistics in mind at once,and flip between them,none after the other,,depending on who they're speaking to. 
 So we asked ourselves,,can the babies take statisticsnon a brand new language?,And we tested thisnby exposing American babies,who'd never heard a second language,to Mandarin for the first timenduring the critical period.,We knew that, when monolingualsnwere tested in Taipei and Seattle,on the Mandarin sounds,nthey showed the same pattern.,Six to eight months,nthey're totally equivalent.,Two months later,nsomething incredible happens.,But the Taiwanese babies are gettingnbetter, not the American babies.,What we did was expose American babies,nduring this period, to Mandarin.,It was like having Mandarin relativesncome and visit for a month,and move into your housenand talk to the babies for 12 sessions.,Here's what it looked likenin the laboratory. 
 (Mandarin) 
 PK: So what have we donento their little brains? 
 (Laughter) 
 We had to run a control group to make sure,that coming into the laboratoryndidn't improve your Mandarin skills.,So a group of babies came innand listened to English.,And we can see from the graph,that exposure to Englishndidn't improve their Mandarin.,But look at what happened to the babiesnexposed to Mandarin for 12 sessions.,They were as good as the babies in Taiwan,who'd been listeningnfor 10 and a half months.,What it demonstrated is that babiesntake statistics on a new language.,Whatever you put in front of them,nthey'll take statistics on. 
 But we wondered what role,the human being playednin this learning exercise.,So we ran another group of babiesnin which the kids got the same dosage,,the same 12 sessions,nbut over a television set.,And another group of babiesnwho had just audio exposure,and looked at a teddy bear on the screen.,What did we do to their brains?,What you see here is the audio result --,no learning whatsoever --,and the video result --,no learning whatsoever.,It takes a human beingnfor babies to take their statistics.,The social brain is controlling,when the babiesnare taking their statistics. 
 We want to get inside the brainnand see this thing happening,as babies are in front of televisions,nas opposed to in front of human beings.,Thankfully, we have a new machine,nmagnetoencephalography,,that allows us to do this.,It looks like a hair dryer from Mars.,But it's completely safe,ncompletely noninvasive and silent.,We're looking at millimeter accuracy,with regard to spatialnand millisecond accuracy,using 306 SQUIDs --,these are superconductingnquantum interference devices --,to pick up the magnetic fieldsnthat change as we do our thinking.,We're the first in the worldnto record babies in an MEG machine,while they are learning. 
 So this is little Emma.,She's a six-monther.,And she's listening to various languagesnin the earphones that are in her ears.,You can see, she can move around.,We're tracking her headnwith little pellets in a cap,,so she's free to movencompletely unconstrained.,It's a technical tour de force.,What are we seeing?,We're seeing the baby brain.,As the baby hears a word in her language,nthe auditory areas light up,,and then subsequently areas surrounding itnthat we think are related to coherence,,getting the brain coordinatednwith its different areas, and causality,,one brain areancausing another to activate. 
 We are embarking on a grandnand golden age of knowledge,about child's brain development.,We're going to be ablento see a child's brain,as they experience an emotion,nas they learn to speak and read,,as they solve a math problem,nas they have an idea.,And we're going to be able to inventnbrain-based interventions,for children who have difficulty learning.,Just as the poets and writers described,,we're going to be able to see, I think,nthat wondrous openness,,utter and complete openness,nof the mind of a child.,In investigating the child's brain,,we're going to uncover deep truthsnabout what it means to be human,,and in the process,,we may be able to help keepnour own minds open to learning,for our entire lives. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Tonight, I want to have a conversation about,this incredible global issue,that's at the intersection of land use, food and environment,,something we can all relate to,,and what I've been calling the other inconvenient truth. 
 But first, I want to take you on a little journey.,Let's first visit our planet, but at night,,and from space.,This is what our planet looks like from outer space,at nighttime, if you were to take a satellite and travel,around the planet. And the thing you would notice first,,of course, is how dominant the human presence,on our planet is.,We see cities, we see oil fields,,you can even make out fishing fleets in the sea,,that we are dominating much of our planet,,and mostly through the use of energy,that we see here at night.,But let's go back and drop it a little deeper,and look during the daytime.,What we see during the day is our landscapes. 
 This is part of the Amazon Basin, a place called Rondônia,in the south-center part of the Brazilian Amazon.,If you look really carefully in the upper right-hand corner,,you're going to see a thin white line,,which is a road that was built in the 1970s.,If we come back to the same place in 2001,,what we're going to find is that these roads,spurt off more roads, and more roads after that,,at the end of which is a small clearing in the rainforest,where there are going to be a few cows.,These cows are used for beef. We're going to eat these cows.,And these cows are eaten basically in South America,,in Brazil and Argentina. They're not being shipped up here.,But this kind of fishbone pattern of deforestation,is something we notice a lot of around the tropics,,especially in this part of the world. 
 If we go a little bit further south in our little tour of the world,,we can go to the Bolivian edge of the Amazon,,here also in 1975, and if you look really carefully,,there's a thin white line through that kind of seam,,and there's a lone farmer out there,in the middle of the primeval jungle.,Let's come back again a few years later, here in 2003,,and we'll see that that landscape actually looks,a lot more like Iowa than it does like a rainforest.,In fact, what you're seeing here are soybean fields.,These soybeans are being shipped to Europe and to China,as animal feed, especially after the mad cow disease scare,about a decade ago, where we don't want to feed animals,animal protein anymore, because that can transmit disease.,Instead, we want to feed them more vegetable proteins.,So soybeans have really exploded,,showing how trade and globalization are,really responsible for the connections to rainforests,and the Amazon -- an incredibly strange,and interconnected world that we have today. 
 Well, again and again, what we find as we look,around the world in our little tour of the world,is that landscape after landscape after landscape,have been cleared and altered for growing food,and other crops. 
 So one of the questions we've been asking is,,how much of the world is used to grow food,,and where is it exactly, and how can we change that,into the future, and what does it mean?,Well, our team has been looking at this on a global scale,,using satellite data and ground-based data kind of to track,farming on a global scale.,And this is what we found, and it's startling.,This map shows the presence of agriculture,on planet Earth.,The green areas are the areas we use to grow crops,,like wheat or soybeans or corn or rice or whatever.,That's 16 million square kilometers' worth of land.,If you put it all together in one place,,it'd be the size of South America.,The second area, in brown, is the world's pastures,and rangelands, where our animals live.,That area's about 30 million square kilometers,,or about an Africa's worth of land,,a huge amount of land, and it's the best land, of course,,is what you see. And what's left is, like,,the middle of the Sahara Desert, or Siberia,,or the middle of a rain forest.,We're using a planet's worth of land already.,If we look at this carefully, we find it's about 40 percent,of the Earth's land surface is devoted to agriculture,,and it's 60 times larger,than all the areas we complain about,,our suburban sprawl and our cities where we mostly live.,Half of humanity lives in cities today,,but a 60-times-larger area is used to grow food.,So this is an amazing kind of result,,and it really shocked us when we looked at that. 
 So we're using an enormous amount of land for agriculture,,but also we're using a lot of water.,This is a photograph flying into Arizona,,and when you look at it, you're like,,"What are they growing here?" It turns out,they're growing lettuce in the middle of the desert,using water sprayed on top.,Now, the irony is, it's probably sold,in our supermarket shelves in the Twin Cities.,But what's really interesting is, this water's got to come,from some place, and it comes from here,,the Colorado River in North America.,Well, the Colorado on a typical day in the 1950s,,this is just, you know, not a flood, not a drought,,kind of an average day, it looks something like this.,But if we come back today, during a normal condition,to the exact same location, this is what's left.,The difference is mainly irrigating the desert for food,,or maybe golf courses in Scottsdale, you take your pick.,Well, this is a lot of water, and again, we're mining water,and using it to grow food,,and today, if you travel down further down the Colorado,,it dries up completely and no longer flows into the ocean.,We've literally consumed an entire river in North America,for irrigation. 
 Well, that's not even the worst example in the world.,This probably is: the Aral Sea.,Now, a lot you will remember this from your geography classes.,This is in the former Soviet Union,in between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan,,one of the great inland seas of the world.,But there's kind of a paradox here, because it looks like,it's surrounded by desert. Why is this sea here?,The reason it's here is because, on the right-hand side,,you see two little rivers kind of coming down,through the sand, feeding this basin with water.,Those rivers are draining snowmelt from mountains,far to the east, where snow melts, it travels down the river,through the desert, and forms the great Aral Sea.,Well, in the 1950s, the Soviets decided to divert that water,to irrigate the desert to grow cotton, believe it or not,,in Kazakhstan, to sell cotton to the international markets,to bring foreign currency into the Soviet Union.,They really needed the money.,Well, you can imagine what happens. You turn off,the water supply to the Aral Sea, what's going to happen?,Here it is in 1973,,1986,,1999,,2004,,and about 11 months ago.,It's pretty extraordinary.,Now a lot of us in the audience here live in the Midwest.,Imagine that was Lake Superior.,Imagine that was Lake Huron.,It's an extraordinary change. 
 This is not only a change in water and,where the shoreline is, this is a change in the fundamentals,of the environment of this region.,Let's start with this.,The Soviet Union didn't really have a Sierra Club.,Let's put it that way.,So what you find in the bottom of the Aral Sea ain't pretty.,There's a lot of toxic waste, a lot of things,that were dumped there that are now becoming airborne.,One of those small islands that was remote,and impossible to get to was a site,of Soviet biological weapons testing.,You can walk there today.,Weather patterns have changed.,Nineteen of the unique 20 fish species found only,in the Aral Sea are now wiped off the face of the Earth.,This is an environmental disaster writ large. 
 But let's bring it home.,This is a picture that Al Gore gave me a few years ago,that he took when he was in the Soviet Union,a long, long time ago,,showing the fishing fleets of the Aral Sea.,You see the canal they dug?,They were so desperate to try to, kind of, float the boats into,the remaining pools of water, but they finally had to give up,because the piers and the moorings simply couldn't,keep up with the retreating shoreline.,I don't know about you, but I'm terrified that future,archaeologists will dig this up and write stories about,our time in history, and wonder, "What were you thinking?",Well, that's the future we have to look forward to. 
 We already use about 50 percent of the Earth's fresh water,that's sustainable, and agriculture alone,is 70 percent of that.,So we use a lot of water, a lot of land for agriculture.,We also use a lot of the atmosphere for agriculture.,Usually when we think about the atmosphere,,we think about climate change and greenhouse gases,,and mostly around energy,,but it turns out agriculture is one of the biggest emitters,of greenhouse gases too.,If you look at carbon dioxide from,burning tropical rainforest,,or methane coming from cows and rice,,or nitrous oxide from too many fertilizers,,it turns out agriculture is 30 percent of the greenhouse,gases going into the atmosphere from human activity.,That's more than all our transportation.,It's more than all our electricity.,It's more than all other manufacturing, in fact.,It's the single largest emitter of greenhouse gases,of any human activity in the world.,And yet, we don't talk about it very much. 
 So we have this incredible presence today of agriculture,dominating our planet,,whether it's 40 percent of our land surface,,70 percent of the water we use,,30 percent of our greenhouse gas emissions.,We've doubled the flows of nitrogen and phosphorus,around the world simply by using fertilizers,,causing huge problems of water quality from rivers,,lakes, and even oceans, and it's also the single biggest,driver of biodiversity loss.,So without a doubt, agriculture is,the single most powerful force unleashed on this planet,since the end of the ice age. No question.,And it rivals climate change in importance.,And they're both happening at the same time. 
 But what's really important here to remember is that,it's not all bad. It's not that agriculture's a bad thing.,In fact, we completely depend on it.,It's not optional. It's not a luxury. It's an absolute necessity.,We have to provide food and feed and, yeah,,fiber and even biofuels to something like seven billion people,in the world today, and if anything,,we're going to have the demands on agriculture,increase into the future. It's not going to go away.,It's going to get a lot bigger, mainly because of,growing population. We're seven billion people today,heading towards at least nine,,probably nine and a half before we're done.,More importantly, changing diets.,As the world becomes wealthier as well as more populous,,we're seeing increases in dietary consumption of meat,,which take a lot more resources than a vegetarian diet does.,So more people, eating more stuff, and richer stuff,,and of course having an energy crisis at the same time,,where we have to replace oil with other energy sources,that will ultimately have to include some kinds of biofuels,and bio-energy sources.,So you put these together. It's really hard to see,how we're going to get to the rest of the century,without at least doubling global agricultural production. 
 Well, how are we going to do this? How are going to,double global ag production around the world? 
 Well, we could try to farm more land.,This is an analysis we've done, where on the left is where,the crops are today, on the right is where they could be,based on soils and climate, assuming climate change,doesn't disrupt too much of this,,which is not a good assumption.,We could farm more land, but the problem is,the remaining lands are in sensitive areas.,They have a lot of biodiversity, a lot of carbon,,things we want to protect.,So we could grow more food by expanding farmland,,but we'd better not,,because it's ecologically a very, very dangerous thing to do. 
 Instead, we maybe want to freeze the footprint,of agriculture and farm the lands we have better.,This is work that we're doing to try to highlight places,in the world where we could improve yields,without harming the environment.,The green areas here show where corn yields,,just showing corn as an example,,are already really high, probably the maximum you could,find on Earth today for that climate and soil,,but the brown areas and yellow areas are places where,we're only getting maybe 20 or 30 percent of the yield,you should be able to get.,You see a lot of this in Africa, even Latin America,,but interestingly, Eastern Europe, where Soviet Union,and Eastern Bloc countries used to be,,is still a mess agriculturally.,Now, this would require nutrients and water.,It's going to either be organic or conventional,or some mix of the two to deliver that.,Plants need water and nutrients.,But we can do this, and there are opportunities to make this work. 
 But we have to do it in a way that is sensitive,to meeting the food security needs of the future,and the environmental security needs of the future.,We have to figure out how to make this tradeoff between,growing food and having a healthy environment work better. 
 Right now, it's kind of an all-or-nothing proposition.,We can grow food in the background --,that's a soybean field —,and in this flower diagram, it shows we grow a lot of food,,but we don't have a lot clean water, we're not storing,a lot of carbon, we don't have a lot of biodiversity.,In the foreground, we have this prairie,that's wonderful from the environmental side,,but you can't eat anything. What's there to eat?,We need to figure out how to bring both of those together,into a new kind of agriculture that brings them all together. 
 Now, when I talk about this, people often tell me,,"Well, isn't blank the answer?" -- organic food,,local food, GMOs, new trade subsidies, new farm bills --,and yeah, we have a lot of good ideas here,,but not any one of these is a silver bullet.,In fact, what I think they are is more like silver buckshot.,And I love silver buckshot. You put it together,and you've got something really powerful,,but we need to put them together. 
 So what we have to do, I think, is invent a new kind,of agriculture that blends the best ideas,of commercial agriculture and the green revolution,with the best ideas of organic farming and local food,and the best ideas of environmental conservation,,not to have them fighting each other but to have them,collaborating together to form a new kind of agriculture,,something I call "terraculture," or farming for a whole planet. 
 Now, having this conversation has been really hard,,and we've been trying very hard to bring these key points,to people to reduce the controversy,,to increase the collaboration.,I want to show you a short video that does kind of show,our efforts right now to bring these sides together,into a single conversation. So let me show you that.,(Music),("Institute on the Environment, University of Minnesota: Driven to Discover"),(Music),("The world population is growing,by 75 million people each year.,That's almost the size of Germany.,Today, we're nearing 7 billion people.,At this rate, we'll reach 9 billion people by 2040.,And we all need food.,But how?,How do we feed a growing world without destroying the planet?,We already know climate change is a big problem.,But it's not the only problem.,We need to face 'the other inconvenient truth.',A global crisis in agriculture.,Population growth + meat consumption + dairy consumption + energy costs + bioenergy production = stress on natural resources.,More than 40\% of Earth's land has been cleared for agriculture.,Global croplands cover 16 million km².,That's almost the size of South America.,Global pastures cover 30 million km².,That's the size of Africa.,Agriculture uses 60 times more land than urban and suburban areas combined.,Irrigation is the biggest use of water on the planet.,We use 2,800 cubic kilometers of water on crops every year.,That's enough to fill 7,305 Empire State Buildings every day.,Today, many large rivers have reduced flows.,Some dry up altogether.,Look at the Aral Sea, now turned to desert.,Or the Colorado River, which no longer flows to the ocean.,Fertilizers have more than doubled the phosphorus and nitrogen in the environment.,The consequence?,Widespread water pollution,and massive degradation of lakes and rivers.,Surprisingly, agriculture is the biggest contributor to climate change.,It generates 30\% of greenhouse gas emissions.,That's more than the emissions from all electricity and industry,,or from all the world's planes, trains and automobiles.,Most agricultural emissions come from tropical deforestation,,methane from animals and rice fields,,and nitrous oxide from over-fertilizing.,There is nothing we do that transforms the world more than agriculture.,And there's nothing we do that is more crucial to our survival.,Here's the dilemma...,As the world grows by several billion more people,,We'll need to double, maybe even triple, global food production.,So where do we go from here?,We need a bigger conversation, an international dialogue.,We need to invest in real solutions:,incentives for farmers, precision agriculture, new crop varieties, drip irrigation,,gray water recycling, better tillage practices, smarter diets.,We need everyone at the table.,Advocates of commercial agriculture,,environmental conservation,,and organic farming...,must work together.,There is no single solution.,We need collaboration,,imagination,,determination,,because failure is not an option.,How do we feed the world without destroying it?,Yeah, so we face one of the greatest grand challenges,in all of human history today:,the need to feed nine billion people,and do so sustainably and equitably and justly,,at the same time protecting our planet,for this and future generations.,This is going to be one of the hardest things,we ever have done in human history,,and we absolutely have to get it right,,and we have to get it right on our first and only try.,So thanks very much. (Applause)Well, the subject of difficult negotiation,reminds me of one of my favorite storiesnfrom the Middle East,,of a man who leftnto his three sons, 17 camels.,To the first son, he left half the camels;,to the second son,nhe left a third of the camels;,and to the youngest son,nhe left a ninth of the camels.,The three sons got into a negotiation --n17 doesn't divide by two.,It doesn't divide by three.,It doesn't divide by nine.,Brotherly tempers started to get strained.,Finally, in desperation,,they went and they consultedna wise old woman.,The wise old woman thoughtnabout their problem for a long time,,and finally she came back and said,n"Well, I don't know if I can help you,,but at least, if you want,nyou can have my camel.",So then, they had 18 camels.,The first son took his half --nhalf of 18 is nine.,The second son took his third --na third of 18 is six.,The youngest son took his ninth --na ninth of 18 is two.,You get 17.,They had one camel left over.,They gave it back to the wise old woman. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, if you thinknabout that story for a moment,,I think it resembles a lotnof the difficult negotiations,we get involved in.,They start off like 17 camels,nno way to resolve it.,Somehow, what we need to do,is step back from those situations,nlike that wise old woman,,look at the situation through fresh eyes,and come up with an 18th camel.,Finding that 18th camelnin the world's conflicts,has been my life passion. 
 I basically see humanityna bit like those three brothers.,We're all one family.,We know that scientifically,,thanks to the communications revolution,,all the tribes on the planet --nall 15,000 tribes --,are in touch with each other.,And it's a big family reunion.,And yet, like many family reunions,,it's not all peace and light.,There's a lot of conflict,,and the question is:nHow do we deal with our differences?,How do we deal withnour deepest differences,,given the human propensity for conflict,and the human genius at devisingnweapons of enormous destruction?,That's the question. 
 As I've spent the last better partnof three decades, almost four,,traveling the world,,trying to work, gettingninvolved in conflicts,ranging from Yugoslavia to the Middle East,to Chechnya to Venezuela --,some of the most difficult conflictsnon the face of the planet --,I've been asking myself that question.,And I think I've found, in some ways,nwhat is the secret to peace.,It's actually surprisingly simple.,It's not easy, but it's simple.,It's not even new.,It may be one of our mostnancient human heritages.,The secret to peace is us.,It's us who act as a surroundingncommunity around any conflict,,who can play a constructive role. 
 Let me give you just a story, an example.,About 20 years ago,,I was in South Africa,nworking with the parties in that conflict,,and I had an extra month,,so I spent some time livingnwith several groups of San Bushmen.,I was curious about them, about the waynin which they resolve conflict.,Because, after all, within living memory,nthey were hunters and gatherers,,living pretty muchnlike our ancestors lived,for maybe 99 percent of the human story.,And all the men have these poison arrowsnthat they use for hunting --,absolutely fatal.,So how do they dealnwith their differences?,Well, what I learned is, wheneverntempers rise in those communities,,someone goes and hidesnthe poison arrows out in the bush,,and then everyone sits aroundnin a circle like this,,and they sit and they talk and they talk.,It may take two days,nthree days, four days,,but they don't restnuntil they find a resolution,or better yet -- a reconciliation.,And if tempers are still too high,,then they send someonenoff to visit some relatives,,as a cooling-off period. 
 Well, that system is, I think,nprobably the system,that kept us alive to this point,,given our human tendencies.,That system, I call "the third side.",Because if you think about it,nnormally when we think of conflict,,when we describe it,,there's always two sides --,it's Arabs versus Israelis,nlabor versus management,,husband versus wife,nRepublicans versus Democrats.,But what we don't often see,is that there's always a third side,,and the third side of the conflict is us,nit's the surrounding community,,it's the friends, the allies,,the family members, the neighbors.,And we can playnan incredibly constructive role. 
 Perhaps the most fundamental waynin which the third side can help,is to remind the partiesnof what's really at stake.,For the sake of the kids,nfor the sake of the family,,for the sake of the community,nfor the sake of the future,,let's stop fighting for a momentnand start talking.,Because, the thing is,,when we're involved in conflict,,it's very easy to lose perspective.,It's very easy to react.,Human beings -- we're reaction machines.,And as the saying goes,,when angry, you will make the best speech,you will ever regret. 
 (Laughter) 
 And so the third side reminds us of that.,The third side helps us go to the balcony,,which is a metaphornfor a place of perspective,,where we can keep our eyes on the prize. 
 Let me tell you a little storynfrom my own negotiating experience.,Some years ago, I was involvednas a facilitator in some very tough talks,between the leaders of Russianand the leaders of Chechnya.,There was a war going on, as you know.,And we met in the Hague,nin the Peace Palace,,in the same room where the Yugoslavnwar-crimes tribunal was taking place.,And the talks got offnto a rather rocky start,when the vice president of Chechnyanbegan by pointing at the Russians,and said, "You should staynright here in your seats,,because you're goingnto be on trial for war crimes.",And then he turned to me and said,,"You're an American.,Look at what you Americansnare doing in Puerto Rico.",And my mind started racing, "Puerto Rico?nWhat do I know about Puerto Rico?",I started reacting. 
 (Laughter) 
 But then, I tried to remembernto go to the balcony.,And then when he paused,and everyone looked at me for a response,,from a balcony perspective,nI was able to thank him for his remarks,and say, "I appreciatenyour criticism of my country,and I take it as a signnthat we're among friends,and can speak candidly to one another." 
 (Laughter) 
 "And what we're here to do is notnto talk about Puerto Rico or the past.,We're here to seenif we can figure out a way,to stop the sufferingnand the bloodshed in Chechnya.",The conversation got back on track.,That's the role of the third side,,to help the parties go to the balcony. 
 Now let me take you, for a moment,,to what's widely regarded as the world'snmost difficult conflict,,or the most impossible conflict,nthe Middle East.,Question is: where's the third side there?,How could we possibly go to the balcony?,Now, I don't pretend to have an answernto the Middle East conflict,,but I think I've got a first step --nliterally, a first step --,something that any one of usncould do as third-siders.,Let me just ask you one question first.,How many of you in the last years,have ever found yourselfnworrying about the Middle East,and wondering what anyone could do?,Just out of curiosity, how many of you?,OK, so the great majority of us.,And here, it's so far away.,Why do we pay so much attentionnto this conflict?,Is it the number of deaths?,There are a hundred times more peoplenwho die in a conflict in Africa,than in the Middle East.,No, it's because of the story,,because we feel personallyninvolved in that story.,Whether we're Christians, Muslims or Jews,nreligious or non-religious,,we feel we have a personal stake in it. 
 Stories matter;,as an anthropologist, I know that.,Stories are what we usento transmit knowledge.,They give meaning to our lives.,That's what we tell herenat TED, we tell stories.,Stories are the key.,And so my question is --,yes, let's try and resolve the politicsnthere in the Middle East,,but let's also take a look at the story.,Let's try to get at the rootnof what it's all about.,Let's see if we can applynthe third side to it.,What would that mean?nWhat is the story there? 
 Now, as anthropologists, we knownthat every culture has an origin story.,What's the origin storynof the Middle East?,In a phrase, it's:,Four thousand years ago,,a man and his family walkednacross the Middle East,,and the world has nevernbeen the same since.,That man, of course, was Abraham.,And what he stood for was unity,nthe unity of the family;,he's the father of us all.,But it's not just what he stood for,nit's what his message was.,His basic message was unity too,,the interconnectedness of it all,nthe unity of it all.,And his basic value was respect,,was kindness toward strangers.,That's what he's known for,nhis hospitality.,So in that sense,,he's the symbolic third sidenof the Middle East.,He's the one who reminds usnthat we're all part of a greater whole.,Now, think about that for a moment. 
 Today, we face the scourge of terrorism.,What is terrorism?,Terrorism is basicallyntaking an innocent stranger,and treating them as an enemynwhom you kill in order to create fear.,What's the opposite of terrorism?,It's taking an innocent stranger,and treating them as a friendnwhom you welcome into your home,,in order to sow and create understanding,or respect, or love. 
 So what if, then, you tooknthe story of Abraham,,which is a third-side story,,what if that could be --,because Abraham stands for hospitality --,what if that could benan antidote to terrorism?,What if that could be a vaccinenagainst religious intolerance?,How would you bring that story to life?,Now, it's not enough just to tell a story.,That's powerful, but people neednto experience the story.,They need to be able to live the story.,How would you do that?,And that was my thinkingnof how would you do that.,And that's what comesnto the first step here.,Because the simple way to do that is:,you go for a walk.,You go for a walknin the footsteps of Abraham.,You retrace the footsteps of Abraham.,Because walking has a real power.,You know, as an anthropologist,nwalking is what made us human.,It's funny -- when you walk,nyou walk side-by-side,,in the same common direction.,Now if I were to come to you face-to-face,and come this close to you,,you would feel threatened.,But if I walk shoulder-to-shoulder,,even touching shoulders,,it's no problem.,Who fights while they walk?,That's why in negotiations,noften, when things get tough,,people go for walks in the woods. 
 So the idea came to menof, what about inspiring a path,,a route -- think the Silk Route,nthink the Appalachian Trail --,that followed in the footsteps of Abraham?,People said, "That's crazy. You can't.,You can't retrace the footstepsnof Abraham -- it's too insecure,,you've got to cross all these borders,,it goes across 10 different countriesnin the Middle East,,because it unites them all.",And so we studied the idea at Harvard.,We did our due diligence.,And then a few years ago,,a group of us, about 25 of usnfrom 10 different countries,,decided to see if we could retracenthe footsteps of Abraham,,going from his initial birthplacenin the city of Urfa,in Southern Turkey, Northern Mesopotamia.,And we then took a bus and took some walks,and went to Harran, where, in the Bible,nhe sets off on his journey.,Then we crossed the borderninto Syria, went to Aleppo,,which, turns out, is named after Abraham.,We went to Damascus,,which has a long historynassociated with Abraham.,We then came to Northern Jordan,,to Jerusalem -- which is allnabout Abraham -- to Bethlehem,,and finally, to the placenwhere he's buried, in Hebron.,So effectively, we went from womb to tomb.,We showed it could be done.,It was an amazing journey. 
 Let me ask you a question.,How many of you have had the experiencenof being in a strange neighborhood,or strange land,,and a total stranger, perfect stranger,,comes up to younand shows you some kindness --,maybe invites you into their home,ngives you a drink,,gives you a coffee, gives you a meal?,How many of you have evernhad that experience?,That's the essence of the Abraham Path.,That's what you discover as you goninto these villages in the Middle East,where you expect hostility,,and you get the most amazing hospitality,,all associated with Abraham:,"In the name of Father Ibrahim,nlet me offer you some food.",So what we discovered,is that Abraham is not just a figurenout of a book for those people;,he's alive, he's a living presence. 
 And to make a long story short,,in the last couple of years now,,thousands of people have begun to walknparts of the path of Abraham,in the Middle East,,enjoying the hospitalitynof the people there.,They've begun to walknin Israel and Palestine,,in Jordan, in Turkey, in Syria.,It's an amazing experience.,Men, women, young people, old people --,more women than men,nactually, interestingly. 
 For those who can't walk,,who are unable to get there right now,,people started to organize walksnin cities, in their own communities.,In Cincinnati, for instance,nthey organized a walk,from a church to a mosque to a synagoguenand all had an Abrahamic meal together.,It was Abraham Path Day.,In São Paulo, Brazil,nit's become an annual event,for thousands of people to runnin a virtual Abraham Path Run,,uniting the different communities.,The media love it; they really adore it.,They lavish attention on itnbecause it's visual,and it spreads the idea,,this idea of Abrahamic hospitality,nof kindness towards strangers.,And just a couple weeks ago,nthere was an NPR story on it.,Last month,,there was a piecenin the Manchester Guardian about it,,two whole pages.,And they quoted a villager,who said, "This walk connectsnus to the world.",He said, "It was like a lightnthat went on in our lives --,it brought us hope.",And so that's what it's about. 
 But it's not just about psychology;,it's about economics.,Because as people walk, they spend money.,And this woman right here, Um Ahmad,,is a woman who lives on the pathnin Northern Jordan.,She's desperately poor.,She's partially blind,nher husband can't work,,she's got seven kids.,But what she can do is cook.,And so she's begun to cooknfor some groups of walkers,who come through the villagenand have a meal in her home.,They sit on the floor --nshe doesn't even have a tablecloth.,She makes the most delicious food,,that's fresh from the herbsnin the surrounding countryside.,And so more and more walkers have come,,and lately she's begun to earn an incomento support her family.,And so she told our team there, she said,,"You have made me visible,in a village where peoplenwere once ashamed to look at me.",That's the potential of the Abraham Path. 
 There are literally hundredsnof those kinds of communities,across the Middle East, across the path.,The potential is basicallynto change the game.,And to change the game, you have to changenthe frame, the way we see things --,to change the framenfrom hostility to hospitality,,from terrorism to tourism.,And in that sense, the Abraham Path,is a game-changer. 
 Let me just show you one thing.,I have a little acorn here,that I picked up while I was walkingnon the path earlier this year.,Now, the acorn is associatednwith the oak tree, of course --,grows into an oak tree,nwhich is associated with Abraham.,The path right now is like an acorn;,it's still in its early phase.,What would the oak tree look like?,When I think back to my childhood,,a good part of which I spent,nafter being born here in Chicago,,I spent in Europe.,If you had been in the ruins of, say,nLondon in 1945, or Berlin,,and you had said,,"Sixty years from now,,this is going to be the most peaceful,nprosperous part of the planet,",people would have thoughtnyou were certifiably insane.,But they did it, thanksnto a common identity, Europe,,and a common economy.,So my question is,nif it can be done in Europe,,why not in the Middle East?,Why not, thanks to a common identity,nwhich is the story of Abraham,,and thanks to a common economy thatnwould be based, in good part, on tourism? 
 So let me conclude, then,,by saying that in the last 35 years,,as I've workednin some of the most dangerous,,difficult and intractable conflictsnaround the planet,,I have yet to see one conflictnthat I felt could not be transformed.,It's not easy, of course.,But it's possible.,It was done in South Africa.,It was done in Northern Ireland.,It could be done anywhere.,It simply depends on us.,It depends on us taking the third side.,So let me invite you to considerntaking the third side,,even as a very small step.,We're about to take a break in a moment.,Just go up to someone,who's from a different culture,na different country,,a different ethnicity --nsome difference --,and engage them in a conversation.,Listen to them.,That's a third-side act.,That's walking Abraham's Path.,After a TED Talk,,why not a TED Walk? 
 (Laughter) 
 So let me just leave younwith three things.,One is, the secret to peacenis the third side.,The third side is us.,Each of us, with a single step,,can take the world, can bring the world,a step closer to peace.,There's an old African proverb that goes:,"When spiderwebs unite,,they can halt even the lion.",If we're able to unitenour third-side webs of peace,,we can even halt the lion of war. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)So I'm going to talk about work;,specifically, why people can'tnseem to get work done at work,,which is a problem we all kind of have.,But let's sort of start at the beginning. 
 So, we have companiesnand non-profits and charities,and all these groups that havenemployees or volunteers of some sort.,And they expect these peoplenwho work for them,to do great work --,I would hope, at least.,At least good work, hopefully,nat least it's good work --,hopefully great work.,And so what they typicallyndo is they decide,that all these people need to comentogether in one place to do that work.,So a company, or a charity,nor an organization of any kind,,unless you're working in Africa,nif you're really lucky to do that --,most people have to gonto an office every day. 
 And so these companies,,they build offices.,They go out and they buy a building,nor they rent a building,,or they lease some space,,and they fill this space with stuff.,They fill it with tables, or desks,,chairs, computer equipment,,software, Internet access,,maybe a fridge, maybe a few other things,,and they expect their employees,nor their volunteers,,to come to that locationnevery day to do great work.,It seems like it's perfectlynreasonable to ask that. 
 However, if you actually talk to people,and even question yourself,nand you ask yourself,,where do you really want to go when younreally need to get something done?,You'll find out that people don't saynwhat businesses think they would say.,If you ask people the question:,Where do you need to gonwhen you need to get something done?,Typically, you get three differentnkinds of answers.,One is kind of a placenor a location or a room.,Another one is a moving object,,and a third is a time. 
 So here are some examples.,I've been asking people this questionnfor about 10 years:,"Where do you go when younreally need to get something done?",I'll hear things like, the porch,nthe deck, the kitchen.,I'll hear things likenan extra room in the house,,the basement,,the coffee shop, the library.,And then you'll hearnthings like the train,,a plane, a car -- so, the commute.,And then you'll hear people say,,"Well, it doesn't reallynmatter where I am,,as long as it's early in the morningnor late at night or on the weekends.",You almost never hearnsomeone say, "The office.",But businesses are spending all this moneynon this place called the office,,and they're making peoplengo to it all the time,,yet people don't do work in the office. 
 What is that about? 
 (Laughter) 
 Why is that? Why is that happening?,And what you find out is,,if you dig a little bit deeper,nyou find out that people --,this is what happens:,People go to work,,and they're basicallyntrading in their work day,for a series of "work moments" --nthat's what happens at the office.,You don't have a work day anymore.nYou have work moments.,It's like the front doornof the office is like a Cuisinart,,and you walk in and your daynis shredded to bits,,because you have 15 minutes here,n30 minutes there,,and something else happens,nyou're pulled off your work,,then you have 20 minutes, then it's lunch,nthen you have something else to do ...,Then you've got 15 minutes, and someonenpulls you aside and asks you a question,,and before you know it, it's 5 p.m.,,and you look back on the day,,and you realize that youndidn't get anything done.,We've all been through this.,We probably went through it yesterdaynor the day before, or the day before that.,You look back on your day,,and you're like,n"I got nothing done today.,I was at work. I sat at my desk.nI used my expensive computer.,I used the software they told me to use.,I went to these meetingsnI was asked to go to.,I did these conference calls.nI did all this stuff.,But I didn't actually do anything.,I just did tasks.,I didn't actually getnmeaningful work done." 
 And what you find is that,nespecially with creative people --,designers, programmers,nwriters, engineers, thinkers --,that people really need long stretchesnof uninterrupted time,to get something done.,You cannot ask somebodynto be creative in 15 minutes,and really think about a problem.,You might have a quick idea,,but to be in deep thought about a problemnand really consider a problem carefully,,you need long stretchesnof uninterrupted time.,And even though the work daynis typically eight hours,,how many people here have ever hadneight hours to themselves at the office?,How about seven hours?,Six? Five? Four?,When's the last time you hadnthree hours to yourself at the office?,Two hours? One, maybe?,Very, very few people actually have,long stretches of uninterruptedntime at an office.,And this is why peoplenchoose to do work at home,,or they might go to the office,,but they might go to the officenreally early in the day,,or late at night when no one's around,,or they stick aroundnafter everyone's left,,or go in on the weekends,,or they get work done on the plane,nin the car or in the train,,because there are no distractions. 
 Now there are differentnkinds of distractions,,but not the really bad distractions,nwhich I'll talk about in a minute.,And this whole phenomenon of havingnshort bursts of time to get things done,reminds me of another thingnthat doesn't work when you're interrupted,,and that is sleep.,I think that sleep and worknare very closely related --,not because you can work while you'rensleeping and sleep while you're working.,That's not really what I mean.,I'm talking specifically about the factnthat sleep and work are phase-based,,or stage-based, events.,Sleep is about sleep phases, or stages --nsome people call them different things.,There are five of them, and in ordernto get to the really deep ones,,the meaningful ones,nyou have to go through the early ones.,If you're interrupted while you'rengoing through the early ones --,if someone bumps you in bed,nor there's a sound, or whatever happens --,you don't just pick up where you left off. 
 If you're interrupted and woken up,,you have to start again.,So you have to go backna few phases and start again.,And what ends up happening --nyou might have days like this,where you wake up at eight or sevennin the morning, or whenever you get up,,and you're like,n"I didn't sleep very well.,I did the sleep thing --nI went to bed, I laid down,,but I didn't really sleep.",People say you go "to" sleep,,but you don't go to sleep,nyou go towards sleep; it takes a while.,You've got to go through phases and stuff,,and if you're interrupted,nyou don't sleep well.,So does anyone herenexpect someone to sleep well,if they're interrupted all night?,I don't think anyone would say yes.,Why do we expect people to work well,if they're being interruptednall day at the office?,How can we possibly expectnpeople to do their job,if they go to the officenand are interrupted?,That doesn't really seemnlike it makes a lot of sense, to me. 
 So what are the interruptions that happennat the office but not at other places?,Because in other places, you can haveninterruptions like the TV,,or you could go for a walk,nor there's a fridge downstairs,,or you've got your own couch,nor whatever you want to do.,If you talk to certain managers,nthey'll tell you,that they don't wantntheir employees to work at home,because of these distractions.,They'll sometimes also say,,"If I can't see the person,nhow do I know they're working?",which is ridiculous, but that's onenof the excuses that managers give.,And I'm one of these managers.nI understand. I know how this goes.,We all have to improvenon this sort of thing.,But oftentimes they'll cite distractions:,"I can't let someone work at home.,They'll watch TV, or do this other thing.",It turns out those aren'tnthe things that are distracting,,Because those are voluntary distractions.,You decide when you wantnto be distracted by the TV,,when you want to turn something on,,or when you want to gondownstairs or go for a walk.,At the office,,most of the interruptions and distractions,that really cause people notnto get work done are involuntary.,So let's go through a couple of those. 
 Now, managers and bossesnwill often have you think,that the real distractions at work,are things like Facebook and Twitter,and YouTube and other websites,,and in fact, they'll go so farnas to actually ban these sites at work.,Some of you may work at placesnwhere you can't get to certain sites.,I mean, is this China?nWhat the hell is going on here?,You can't go to a website at work,nand that's the problem?,That's why people aren'tngetting work done,,because they're on Facebook and Twitter?,That's kind of ridiculous.nIt's a total decoy.,Today's Facebook and Twitter and YouTube,,these things are justnmodern-day smoke breaks.,No one cared about letting people takena smoke break for 15 minutes 10 years ago,,so why does anyone carenif someone goes to Facebook,or Twitter or YouTube here and there?,Those aren't the realnproblems in the office. 
 The real problems arenwhat I like to call the M&Ms,,the Managers and the Meetings.,Those are the real problemsnin the modern office today.,And this is whynthings don't get done at work,,it's because of the M&Ms.,Now what's interesting is,,if you listen to all the placesnthat people talk about doing work,,like at home, in the car, on a plane,nlate at night, or early in the morning,,you don't find managers and meetings.,You find a lot of other distractions,nbut not managers and meetings.,So these are the thingsnthat you don't find elsewhere,,but you do find at the office.,And managers are basically peoplenwhose job it is to interrupt people.,That's pretty much what managers are for.nThey're for interrupting people.,They don't really do the work, so theynmake sure everyone else is doing work,,which is an interruption.,We have lots of managers in the world now,nand a lot of people in the world,,and a lot of interruptionsnby these managers.,They have to check in:n"Hey, how's it going?,Show me what's up." This sort of thing.,They keep interrupting younat the wrong time,,while you're actually trying to donsomething they're paying you to do,,they tend to interrupt you.,That's kind of bad. 
 But what's even worse is the thingnthat managers do most of all,,which is call meetings.,And meetings are just toxic,,terrible, poisonous things,during the day at work. 
 (Laughter) 
 We all know this to be true,,and you would never see a spontaneousnmeeting called by employees.,It doesn't work that way.,The manager calls the meeting,so the employees can all come together,,and it's an incredibly disruptiventhing to do to people --,to say, "Hey look,,we're going to bring 10 peoplentogether right now and have a meeting.,I don't care what you're doing,,you've got to stop doing it,nso you can have this meeting.",I mean, what are the chancesnthat all 10 people are ready to stop?,What if they're thinking about somethingnimportant, or doing important work?,All of a sudden you tell them they havento stop doing that to do something else.,So they go into a meeting room,nthey get together,,and they talk about stuffnthat doesn't really matter, usually.,Because meetings aren't work.,Meetings are places to gonto talk about things,you're supposed to be doing later. 
 But meetings also procreate.,So one meeting tendsnto lead to another meeting,,which leads to another meeting.,There's often too many peoplenin the meetings,,and they're very, very expensivento the organization.,Companies often think of a one-hournmeeting as a one-hour meeting,,but that's not true,nunless there's only one person.,If there are 10 people, it's a 10-hournmeeting, not a one-hour meeting.,It's 10 hours of productivity takennfrom the rest of the organization,to have this one-hour meeting,nwhich probably should have been handled,by two or three peoplentalking for a few minutes.,But instead, there's a longnscheduled meeting,,because meetings are schedulednthe way software works,,which is in increments of 15 minutes,nor 30 minutes, or an hour.,You don't schedule an eight-hour meetingnwith Outlook; you can't.,You can go 15 minutes or 30 minutesnor 45 minutes or an hour.,And so we tend to fill these times up,when things should go really quickly. 
 So meetings and managers arentwo major problems in businesses today,,especially at offices.,These things don't existnoutside of the office.,So I have some suggestionsnto remedy the situation.,What can managers do --,enlightened managers, hopefully --,what can they do to make the officena better place for people to work,,so it's not the last resort,nbut it's the first resort,,so that people start to say,,"When I really want to get stuff done,nI go to the office.",Because the offices are well-equipped;,everything is therenfor them to do the work.,But they don't want to go there rightnnow, so how do we change that?,I have three suggestionsnto share with you.,I have about three minutes,nso that'll fit perfectly. 
 We've all heardnof the Casual Friday thing.,I don't know if people still do that.,But how about "No-talk Thursdays?" 
 (Laughter) 
 Pick one Thursday once a month,,and cut it in half, just the afternoon --nI'll make it easy for you.,So just the afternoon, one Thursday.,First Thursday of the month,njust the afternoon,,nobody in the officencan talk to each other.,Just silence, that's it.,And what you'll find,is that a tremendous amountnof work gets done,when no one talks to each other.,This is when peoplenactually get stuff done,,is when no one's bothering themnor interrupting them.,Giving someone four hoursnof uninterrupted time,is the best gift you canngive anybody at work.,It's better than a computer,,better than a new monitor,nbetter than new software,,or whatever people typically use.,Giving them four hoursnof quiet time at the office,is going to be incredibly valuable.,If you try that, I think you'll agree,nand hopefully you can do it more often.,So maybe it's every other week,,or every week, once a week,,afternoons no one can talk to each other.,That's something that you'll findnwill really, really work. 
 Another thing you can try,,is switching from activencommunication and collaboration,,which is like face-to-face stuff --ntapping people on the shoulder,,saying hi to them, having meetings,,and replace that with morenpassive models of communication,,using things like emailnand instant messaging,,or collaboration products,nthings like that.,Now some people might saynemail is really distracting,,I.M. is really distracting, and thesenother things are really distracting,,but they're distracting at a timenof your own choice and your own choosing.,You can quit the email app;nyou can't quit your boss.,You can quit I.M.;,you can't hide your manager.,You can put these things away,,and then you can be interruptednon your own schedule, at your own time,,when you're available,nwhen you're ready to go again.,Because work, like sleep,nhappens in phases.,So you'll be going up, doing some work,,and then you'll come down from that work,,and then maybe it's timento check that email or I.M.,There are very, very few thingsnthat are that urgent,,that need to happen, that neednto be answered right this second.,So if you're a manager,,start encouraging people to usenmore things like I.M. and email,and other things that someone can put away,and then get back to younon their own schedule. 
 And the last suggestion I have is that,,if you do have a meeting coming up,,if you have the power, just cancel it.,Just cancel that next meeting. 
 (Laughter) 
 Today's Friday, usually peoplenhave meetings on Monday.,Just don't have it.,I don't mean move it;,I mean just erase itnfrom memory, it's gone.,And you'll find out that everythingnwill be just fine.,All these discussions and decisionsnyou thought you had to make,at this one time at 9 a.m. on Monday,,just forget about them,nand things will be fine.,People will have a more open morning,nthey can actually think.,You'll find out all these thingsnyou thought you had to do,,you don't actually have to do. 
 So those are just three quick suggestionsnI wanted to give you guys to think about.,I hope that some of these ideasnwere at least provocative enough,for managers and bossesnand business owners,and organizers and peoplenwho are in charge of other people,,to think about laying off a little bit,,and giving people more timento get work done.,I think it'll all pay off in the end. 
 So, thanks for listening. 
 (Applause)So I'm here to tell younthat we have a problem with boys,,and it's a serious problem with boys.,Their culture isn't working in schools,,and I'm going to share with you ways,that we can thinknabout overcoming that problem.,First, I want to startnby saying, this is a boy,,and this is a girl,,and this is probably stereotypicallynwhat you think of as a boy and a girl.,If I essentialize gender for you today,nthen you can dismiss what I have to say.,So I'm not going to do that,nI'm not interested in doing that.,This is a different kind of boynand a different kind of girl.,So the point here is that not all boysnexist within these rigid boundaries,of what we think of as boys and girls,,and not all girls existnwithin those rigid boundaries,of what we think of as girls.,But, in fact, most boysntend to be a certain way,,and most girls tend to be a certain way.,And the point is that, for boys,,the way that they existnand the culture that they embrace,isn't working well in schools now. 
 How do we know that?,The 100 girls projectntells us some really nice statistics.,For example, for every 100 girlsnthat are suspended from school,,there are 250 boysnthat are suspended from school.,For every 100 girlsnwho are expelled from school,,there are 335 boysnwho are expelled from school.,For every 100 girls in special education,,there are 217 boys.,For every 100 girlsnwith a learning disability,,there are 276 boys.,For every 100 girlsnwith an emotional disturbance diagnosed,,we have 324 boys.,And by the way, all of these numbersnare significantly higher,if you happen to be black,,if you happen to be poor,,if you happen to existnin an overcrowded school.,And if you are a boy,,you're four times as likelynto be diagnosed with ADHD --,Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. 
 Now there is another side to this.,And it is important that we recognizenthat women still need help in school,,that salaries are stillnsignificantly lower,,even when controlled for job types,,and that girls have continued to strugglenin math and science for years.,That's all true.,Nothing about that prevents us,from paying attentionnto the literacy needs,of our boys between ages three and 13.,And so we should.,In fact, what we ought to donis take a page from their playbook,,because the initiatives and programsnthat have been set in place,for women in science and engineeringnand mathematics are fantastic.,They've done a lot of goodnfor girls in these situations,,and we ought to be thinking aboutnhow we can make that happen for boys too,in their younger years. 
 Even in their older years,,what we find is thatnthere's still a problem.,When we look at the universities,,60 percent of baccalaureate degreesnare going to women now,,which is a significant shift.,And in fact, university administratorsnare a little uncomfortable about the idea,that we may be getting close to 70 percentnfemale population in universities.,This makes universitynadministrators very nervous,,because girls don't want to gonto schools that don't have boys.,And so we're starting to see,the establishment of men centersnand men studies,to think about how do we engage mennin their experiences in the university.,If you talk to faculty,nthey may say, "Ugh. Yeah, well,,they're playing video games,,and they're gamblingnonline all night long,,and they're playing World of Warcraft,,and that's affectingntheir academic achievement.",Guess what?,Video games are not the cause.,Video games are a symptom.,They were turned off a long timenbefore they got here. 
 So let's talk aboutnwhy they got turned off,when they were between the agesnof three and 13.,There are three reasons that I believe,that boys are out of syncnwith the culture of schools today.,The first is zero tolerance.,A kindergarten teacher I know,nher son donated all of his toys to her,,and when he did, she had to go throughnand pull out all the little plastic guns.,You can't have plastic knivesnand swords and axes,and all that kind of thingnin a kindergarten classroom.,What is it that we're afraid that thisnyoung man is going to do with this gun?,I mean, really.,But here he stands as testament,to the fact that you can't roughhousenon the playground today.,Now I'm not advocating for bullies.,I'm not suggesting that we need to benallowing guns and knives in the school.,But when we say that an Eagle Scoutnin a high school classroom,who has a locked parked carnin the parking lot and a penknife in it,,has to be suspended from school,,I think we may have gonena little too far with zero tolerance. 
 Another way that zero tolerancenlives itself out,is in the writing of boys.,In a lot of classrooms today,,you're not allowed to writenabout anything that's violent.,You're not allowed to write about anythingnthat has to do with video games.,These topics are banned.,Boy comes home from school, and he says,,"I hate writing.","Why do you hate writing, son?nWhat's wrong with writing?","Now I have to writenwhat she tells me to write.","OK, what is she telling you to write?","Poems. I have to write poems.,And little moments in my life.,I don't want to write that stuff.","Well, what do you want to write?,What do you want to write about?","I want to write about video games.nI want to write about leveling-up.,I want to write aboutnthis really interesting world.,I want to write about a tornadonthat comes into our house,and blows all the windows out,,and ruins all the furniturenand kills everybody.","All right. OK.",You tell a teacher that,nand they'll ask you, in all seriousness,,"Should we send this childnto the psychologist?",And the answer is no, he's just a boy.,He's just a little boy.,It's not OK to write these kinds of thingsnin classrooms today. 
 So that's the first reason:,Zero tolerance policiesnand the way they're lived out.,The next reason that boys' culturesnare out of sync with school cultures:,there are fewer male teachers.,Anybody who's over 15ndoesn't know what this means,,because in the last 10 years,,the number of elementary schoolnclassroom teachers has been cut in half.,We went from 14 percent to seven percent.,That means that 93 percent of the teachers,that our young men get in elementarynclassrooms are women.,Now what's the problem with this?,Women are great, yep, absolutely.,But male role models for boysnthat say it's all right to be smart --,they've got dads, they've got pastors,nthey've got Cub Scout leaders,,but ultimately, six hours a day,nfive days a week,they're spending in a classroom,,and most of those classroomsnare not places where men exist.,And so they say, I guess this reallynisn't a place for boys.,This is a place for girls.,And I'm not very good at this,,so I guess I'd better go play video games,or get into sports,nor something like that,,because I obviously don't belong here.,Men don't belong here,nthat's pretty obvious. 
 So that may be a very direct waynthat we see it happen.,But less directly, the lack of malenpresence in the culture --,you've got a teachers' lounge,nand they're having a conversation,about Joey and Johnnynwho beat each other up on the playground.,"What are we going to do with these boys?",The answer to that question changes,depending on who's sittingnaround that table.,Are there men around that table?,Are there moms who've raised boysnaround that table?,You'll see, the conversation changes,depending upon who's sittingnaround the table. 
 Third reason that boysnare out of sync with school today:,Kindergarten is the oldnsecond grade, folks.,We have a serious compressionnof the curriculum happening out there.,When you're three, you better be ablento write your name legibly,,or else we'll consider itna developmental delay.,By the time you're in first grade,,you should be able to readnparagraphs of text,with maybe a picture, maybe not,nin a book of maybe 25 to 30 pages.,If you don't,,we're probably going to be putting youninto a Title I special reading program.,And if you ask Title I teachers,nthey'll tell you,they've got about four or five boysnfor every girl that's in their program,,in the elementary grades. 
 The reason that this is a problem,is because the messagenthat boys are getting,is, "You need to do what the teachernasks you to do all the time.",The teacher's salary dependsnon "No Child Left Behind",and "Race to the Top"nand accountability and testing,and all of this.,So she has to figure out a waynto get all these boys,through this curriculum -- and girls.,This compressed curriculum is badnfor all active kids.,And what happens is,,she says, "Please, sit down,nbe quiet, do what you're told,,follow the rules, manage your time,nfocus, be a girl.",That's what she tells them.,Indirectly, that's what she tells them.,And so this is a very serious problem.,Where is it coming from?nIt's coming from us. 
 (Laughter) 
 We want our babies to readnwhen they are six months old.,Have you seen the ads?,We want to live in Lake Wobegonnwhere every child is above average ...,but what this does to our childrennis really not healthy.,It's not developmentally appropriate,,and it's particularly bad for boys. 
 So what do we do?,We need to meet them where they are.,We need to put ourselves into boy culture.,We need to change the mindsetnof acceptance in boys,in elementary schools.,More specifically, we can donsome very specific things.,We can design better games.,Most of the educational gamesnthat are out there today,are really flashcards.,They're glorified drill and practice.,They don't have the depth,nthe rich narrative,that really engaging video games have,,that the boys are really interested in.,So we need to design better games.,We need to talk to teachers and parentsnand school board members and politicians.,We need to make sure that people seenthat we need more men in the classroom.,We need to look carefullynat our zero tolerance policies.,Do they make sense?,We need to think about how to uncompressnthis curriculum if we can,,trying to bring boys back into a spacenthat is comfortable for them.,All of those conversationsnneed to be happening. 
 There are some great examplesnout there of schools --,the New York Timesnjust talked about a school recently.,A game designer from the New School,put together a wonderfulnvideo gaming school.,But it only treats a few kids,nand so this isn't very scalable.,We have to change the culturenand the feelings,that politicians and school boardnmembers and parents have,about the way we acceptnand what we accept in our schools today.,We need to find more moneynfor game design.,Because good games,nreally good games, cost money,,and World of Warcraft has quite a budget.,Most of the educational games do not. 
 Where we started:,my colleagues Mike Petner,nShawn Vashaw, myself,,we started by trying to looknat the teachers' attitudes,and find out how do they reallynfeel about gaming,,what do they say about it.,And we discovered that they talknabout the kids in their school,,who talk about gaming,nin pretty demeaning ways.,They say, "Oh, yeah. They're alwaysntalking about that stuff.,They're talkingnabout their little action figures,and their little achievementsnor merit badges,,or whatever it is that they get.,And they're always talkingnabout this stuff.",And they say these things as if it's OK.,But if it were your culture,nthink of how that might feel.,It's very uncomfortablento be on the receiving end,of that kind of language.,They're nervous about anythingnthat has anything to do with violence,because of the zero tolerance policies.,They are sure that parentsnand administrators,will never accept anything. 
 So we really need to thinknabout looking at teacher attitudes,and finding ways to change the attitudes,,so that teachers are much more opennand accepting of boy cultures,in their classrooms.,Because, ultimately, if we don't,,then we're going to have boysnwho leave elementary school saying,,"Well I guess that was justna place for girls, it wasn't for me.,So I've got to do gaming,nor I've got to do sports.",If we change these things,nif we pay attention to these things,,and we reengage boys in their learning,,they will leave the elementarynschools saying, "I'm smart." 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)You may not know this,,but you are celebrating an anniversary with me.,I'm not married,,but one year ago today,,I woke up,from a month-long coma,,following a double lung transplant.,Crazy, I know. Insane.,Thank you. 
 Six years before that,,I was starting my career,as an opera singer in Europe,,when I was diagnosed with,idiopathic pulmonary hypertension --,also known as PH.,It happens when there's a thickening,in the pulmonary veins,,making the right side of the heart,work overtime,,and causing what I call,the reverse-Grinch effect.,My heart was three-and-a-half sizes,too big.,Physical activity becomes very difficult,for people with this condition,,and usually after two to five years,,you die.,I went to see this specialist,,and she was top-of-the-field,and told me I had to stop singing.,She said, "Those high notes are going to kill you.",While she didn't have any medical evidence,to back up her claim,that there was a relationship,between operatic arias,and pulmonary hypertension,,she was absolutely emphatic,I was singing my own obituary.,I was very limited by my condition, physically.,But I was not limited when I sang,,and as air came up from my lungs,,through my vocal cords,and passed my lips as sound,,it was the closest thing I had ever come,to transcendence.,And just because of someone's hunch,,I wasn't going to give it up. 
 Thankfully, I met Reda Girgis,,who is dry as toast,,but he and his team at Johns Hopkins,didn't just want me to survive,,they wanted me,to live a meaningful life.,This meant making trade-offs.,I come from Colorado.,It's a mile high,,and I grew up there with my 10 brothers and sisters,and two adoring parents.,Well, the altitude exacerbated my symptoms.,So I moved to Baltimore to be near my doctors,and enrolled in a conservatory nearby.,I couldn't walk as much as I used to,,so I opted for five-inch heels.,And I gave up salt,,I went vegan,,and I started taking huge doses of,sildenafil,,also known as Viagra. 
 (Laughter) 
 My father and my grandfather were always looking for the newest thing,in alternative or traditional therapies,for PH,,but after six months,,I couldn't walk up a small hill. I couldn't climb a flight of stairs.,I could barely stand up,without feeling like I was going to faint.,I had a heart catheterization,,where they measure this internal arterial pulmonary pressure,,which is supposed to be between 15 and 20.,Mine was 146.,I like to do things big,,and it meant one thing:,there is a big gun treatment,for pulmonary hypertension called Flolan,,and it's not just a drug;,it's a way of life.,Doctors insert a catheter into your chest,,which is attached to a pump,that weighs about four-and-a-half pounds.,Every day, 24 hours, that pump is at your side,,administering medicine,directly to your heart,,and it's not,a particularly preferable,medicine in many senses.,This is a list of the side effects:,if you eat too much salt,,like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich,,you'll probably end up in the ICU.,If you go through a metal detector,,you'll probably die.,If you get a bubble in your medicine --,because you have to mix it every morning --,and it stays in there,,you probably die.,If you run out of medicine, you definitely die. 
 No one wants to go on Flolan.,But when I needed it,,it was a godsend.,Within a few days, I could walk again.,Within a few weeks, I was performing,,and in a few months,,I debuted at the Kennedy Center.,The pump was a little bit problematic when performing,,so I'd attach it to my inner thigh,with the help of the girdle and an ACE bandage.,Literally hundreds of elevator rides,were spent with me alone,stuffing the pump into my Spanx,,hoping the doors wouldn't open unexpectedly.,And the tubing coming out of my chest,was a nightmare for costume designers.,I graduated from graduate school in 2006,,and I got a fellowship to go back to Europe.,A few days after arriving,,I met this wonderful, old conductor,who started casting me in all of these roles.,And before long, I was commuting,between Budapest, Milan,and Florence.,Though I was attached,to this ugly, unwanted,,high-maintenance, mechanical pet,,my life was kind of like the happy part in an opera --,very complicated,,but in a good way. 
 Then in February,of 2008,,my grandfather passed away.,He was a big figure in all of our lives,,and we loved him very much.,It certainly didn't prepare me,for what came next.,Seven weeks later,,I got a call from my family.,My father had been in a catastrophic car accident,,and he died.,At 24, my death would have been,entirely expected.,But his --,well, the only way I can articulate how it felt,was that it precipitated,my medical decline.,Against my doctors' and family's wishes,,I needed to go back for the funeral.,I had to say goodbye,in some way, shape or form.,But soon I was showing signs of right-heart failure,,and I had to return to sea level,,doing so knowing,that I probably would never see my home again. 
 I canceled most of my engagements that summer,,but I had one left in Tel Aviv, so I went.,After one performance,,I could barely drag myself,from the stage to the taxicab.,I sat down and felt the blood,rush down from my face,,and in the heat of the desert,,I was freezing cold.,My fingers started turning blue,,and I was like, "What is going on here?",I heard my heart's valves,snapping open and closed.,The cab stopped,,and I pulled my body from it,feeling each ounce of weight,as I walked to the elevator.,I fell through my apartment door,and crawled to the bathroom,where I found my problem:,I had forgotten to mix in,the most important part of my medicine.,I was dying,,and if I didn't mix that stuff up fast,,I would never leave that apartment alive.,I started mixing,,and I felt like everything was going to fall out through one hole or another,,but I just kept on going.,Finally, with the last bottle in and the last bubble out,,I attached the pump to the tubing,and lay there hoping it would kick in,soon enough.,If it didn't, I'd probably see my father,sooner than I anticipated.,Thankfully, in a few minutes,,I saw the signature hive-like rash,appear on my legs,,which is a side effect of the medication,,and I knew I'd be okay. 
 We're not big on fear in my family,,but I was scared.,I went back to the States,,anticipating I'd return to Europe,,but the heart catheterization,showed that I wasn't going anywhere,further that a flight-for-life from Johns Hopkins Hospital.,I performed here and there,,but as my condition deteriorated,,so did my voice.,My doctor wanted me to get on the list for a lung transplant.,I didn't.,I had two friends who had recently died,months after having very challenging surgeries.,I knew another young man, though, who had PH,who died while waiting for one.,I wanted to live.,I thought stem cells were a good option,,but they hadn't developed to a point,where I could take advantage of them yet.,I officially took a break from singing,,and I went to the Cleveland Clinic,to be reevaluated,for the third time in five years, for transplant.,I was sitting there kind of unenthusiastically talking,with the head transplant surgeon,,and I asked him if I needed a transplant,,what I could do to prepare.,He said, "Be happy.,A happy patient,is a healthy patient.",It was like in one verbal swoop,he had channeled my thoughts,on life and medicine,and Confucius.,I still didn't want a transplant,,but in a month,,I was back in the hospital,with some severely edemic kankles --,very attractive.,And it was right-heart failure. 
 I finally decided,it was time to take my doctor's advice.,It was time for me to go to Cleveland,and to start the agonizing wait,for a match.,But the next morning,,while I was still in the hospital,,I got a telephone call.,It was my doctor in Cleveland,,Marie Budev.,And they had lungs.,It was a match.,They were from Texas.,And everybody was really happy for me,,but me.,Because, despite their problems,,I had spent my whole life training my lungs,,and I was not particularly enthusiastic,about giving them up.,I flew to Cleveland,,and my family rushed there,in hopes that they would meet me,and say what we knew,might be our final goodbye.,But organs don't wait,,and I went into surgery,before I could say goodbye.,The last thing I remember,was lying on a white blanket,,telling my surgeon that I needed to see my mother again,,and to please try and save my voice.,I fell into this apocalyptic dream world. 
 During the thirteen-and-a-half-hour surgery,,I flatlined twice,,40 quarts of blood,were infused into my body.,And in my surgeon's 20-year career,,he said it was among the most difficult transplants,that he's ever performed.,They left my chest open for two weeks.,You could see my over-sized heart,beating inside of it.,I was on a dozen machines,that were keeping me alive.,An infection ravaged my skin.,I had hoped my voice would be saved,,but my doctors knew,that the breathing tubes going down my throat,might have already destroyed it.,If they stayed in, there was no way I would ever sing again.,So my doctor got the ENT,,the top guy at the clinic, to come down,and give me surgery,to move the tubes around my voice box.,He said it would kill me.,So my own surgeon performed the procedure,in a last-ditch attempt to save my voice. 
 Though my mom couldn't say goodbye to me,before the surgery,,she didn't leave my side,in the months of recovery that followed.,And if you want an example,of perseverance,,grit and strength,in a beautiful, little package,,it is her.,One year ago,to this very day,,I woke up.,I was 95 lbs.,There were a dozen tubes,coming in and out of my body.,I couldn't walk, I couldn't talk,,I couldn't eat, I couldn't move,,I certainly couldn't sing,,I couldn't even breathe,,but when I looked up,and I saw my mother,,I couldn't help but smile. 
 Whether by a Mack truck,or by heart failure,or faulty lungs,,death happens.,But life isn't really just about avoiding death, is it?,It's about living.,Medical conditions don't negate the human condition.,And when people are allowed,to pursue their passions,,doctors will find they have better,,happier and healthier patients.,My parents were totally stressed out,about me going and auditioning,and traveling and performing all over the place,,but they knew that it was much better for me to do that,than be preoccupied with my own mortality all of the time.,And I'm so grateful they did. 
 This past summer, when I was running and singing,and dancing and playing with my nieces and my nephews,and my brothers and my sisters and my mother and my grandmother,in the Colorado Rockies,,I couldn't help but think of that doctor,who told me that I couldn't sing.,And I wanted to tell her,,and I want to tell you,,we need to stop letting disease,divorce us from our dreams.,When we do,,we will find that patients,don't just survive;,we thrive.,And some of us,might even sing. 
 (Applause),[Singing: French] 
 Thank you.,(Applause),Thank you.,And I'd like to thank my pianist, Monica Lee.,(Applause),Thank you so much.,Thank you.I admit that I'm a little bit nervous here,because I'm going to say some radical things,,about how we should think about cancer differently,,to an audience that contains a lot of people,who know a lot more about cancer than I do.,But I will also contest that I'm not as nervous as I should be,because I'm pretty sure I'm right about this.,(Laughter),And that this, in fact, will be,the way that we treat cancer in the future.,In order to talk about cancer,,I'm going to actually have to --,let me get the big slide here.,First, I'm going to try to give you a different perspective of genomics.,I want to put it in perspective of the bigger picture,of all the other things that are going on --,and then talk about something you haven't heard so much about, which is proteomics.,Having explained those,,that will set up for what I think will be a different idea,about how to go about treating cancer. 
 So let me start with genomics.,It is the hot topic.,It is the place where we're learning the most.,This is the great frontier.,But it has its limitations.,And in particular, you've probably all heard the analogy,that the genome is like the blueprint of your body,,and if that were only true, it would be great,,but it's not.,It's like the parts list of your body.,It doesn't say how things are connected,,what causes what and so on.,So if I can make an analogy,,let's say that you were trying to tell the difference,between a good restaurant, a healthy restaurant,and a sick restaurant,,and all you had was the list of ingredients,that they had in their larder.,So it might be that, if you went to a French restaurant,and you looked through it and you found,they only had margarine and they didn't have butter,,you could say, "Ah, I see what's wrong with them.,I can make them healthy.",And there probably are special cases of that.,You could certainly tell the difference,between a Chinese restaurant and a French restaurant,by what they had in a larder.,So the list of ingredients does tell you something,,and sometimes it tells you something that's wrong.,If they have tons of salt,,you might guess they're using too much salt, or something like that.,But it's limited,,because really to know if it's a healthy restaurant,,you need to taste the food, you need to know what goes on in the kitchen,,you need the product of all of those ingredients. 
 So if I look at a person,and I look at a person's genome, it's the same thing.,The part of the genome that we can read,is the list of ingredients.,And so indeed,,there are times when we can find ingredients,that [are] bad.,Cystic fibrosis is an example of a disease,where you just have a bad ingredient and you have a disease,,and we can actually make a direct correspondence,between the ingredient and the disease.,But most things, you really have to know what's going on in the kitchen,,because, mostly, sick people used to be healthy people --,they have the same genome.,So the genome really tells you much more,about predisposition.,So what you can tell,is you can tell the difference between an Asian person and a European person,by looking at their ingredients list.,But you really for the most part can't tell the difference,between a healthy person and a sick person --,except in some of these special cases. 
 So why all the big deal,about genetics?,Well first of all,,it's because we can read it, which is fantastic.,It is very useful in certain circumstances.,It's also the great theoretical triumph,of biology.,It's the one theory,that the biologists ever really got right.,It's fundamental to Darwin,and Mendel and so on.,And so it's the one thing where they predicted a theoretical construct.,So Mendel had this idea of a gene,as an abstract thing,,and Darwin built a whole theory,that depended on them existing,,and then Watson and Crick,actually looked and found one.,So this happens in physics all the time.,You predict a black hole,,and you look out the telescope and there it is, just like you said.,But it rarely happens in biology.,So this great triumph -- it's so good,,there's almost a religious experience,in biology.,And Darwinian evolution,is really the core theory. 
 So the other reason it's been very popular,is because we can measure it, it's digital.,And in fact,,thanks to Kary Mullis,,you can basically measure your genome in your kitchen,with a few extra ingredients.,So for instance, by measuring the genome,,we've learned a lot about how we're related to other kinds of animals,by the closeness of our genome,,or how we're related to each other -- the family tree,,or the tree of life.,There's a huge amount of information about the genetics,just by comparing the genetic similarity.,Now of course, in medical application,,that is very useful,because it's the same kind of information,that the doctor gets from your family medical history --,except probably,,your genome knows much more about your medical history than you do.,And so by reading the genome,,we can find out much more about your family than you probably know.,And so we can discover things,that probably you could have found,by looking at enough of your relatives,,but they may be surprising.,I did the 23andMe thing,and was very surprised to discover that I am fat and bald.,(Laughter),But sometimes you can learn much more useful things about that. 
 But mostly,what you need to know, to find out if you're sick,,is not your predispositions,,but it's actually what's going on in your body right now.,So to do that, what you really need to do,,you need to look at the things,that the genes are producing,and what's happening after the genetics,,and that's what proteomics is about.,Just like genome mixes the study of all the genes,,proteomics is the study of all the proteins.,And the proteins are all of the little things in your body,that are signaling between the cells --,actually, the machines that are operating --,that's where the action is.,Basically, a human body,is a conversation going on,,both within the cells and between the cells,,and they're telling each other to grow and to die,,and when you're sick,,something's gone wrong with that conversation.,And so the trick is --,unfortunately, we don't have an easy way to measure these,like we can measure the genome. 
 So the problem is that measuring --,if you try to measure all the proteins, it's a very elaborate process.,It requires hundreds of steps,,and it takes a long, long time.,And it matters how much of the protein it is.,It could be very significant that a protein changed by 10 percent,,so it's not a nice digital thing like DNA.,And basically our problem is somebody's in the middle,of this very long stage,,they pause for just a moment,,and they leave something in an enzyme for a second,,and all of a sudden all the measurements from then on,don't work.,And so then people get very inconsistent results,when they do it this way.,People have tried very hard to do this.,I tried this a couple of times,and looked at this problem and gave up on it. 
 I kept getting this call from this oncologist,named David Agus.,And Applied Minds gets a lot of calls,from people who want help with their problems,,and I didn't think this was a very likely one to call back,,so I kept on giving him to the delay list.,And then one day,,I get a call from John Doerr, Bill Berkman,and Al Gore on the same day,saying return David Agus's phone call.,(Laughter),So I was like, "Okay. This guy's at least resourceful.",(Laughter),So we started talking,,and he said, "I really need a better way to measure proteins.",I'm like, "Looked at that. Been there.,Not going to be easy.",He's like, "No, no. I really need it.,I mean, I see patients dying every day,because we don't know what's going on inside of them.,We have to have a window into this.",And he took me through,specific examples of when he really needed it.,And I realized, wow, this would really make a big difference,,if we could do it,,and so I said, "Well, let's look at it." 
 Applied Minds has enough play money,that we can go and just work on something,without getting anybody's funding or permission or anything.,So we started playing around with this.,And as we did it, we realized this was the basic problem --,that taking the sip of coffee --,that there were humans doing this complicated process,and that what really needed to be done,was to automate this process like an assembly line,and build robots,that would measure proteomics.,And so we did that,,and working with David,,we made a little company called Applied Proteomics eventually,,which makes this robotic assembly line,,which, in a very consistent way, measures the protein.,And I'll show you what that protein measurement looks like. 
 Basically, what we do,is we take a drop of blood,out of a patient,,and we sort out the proteins,in the drop of blood,according to how much they weigh,,how slippery they are,,and we arrange them in an image.,And so we can look at literally,hundreds of thousands of features at once,out of that drop of blood.,And we can take a different one tomorrow,,and you will see your proteins tomorrow will be different --,they'll be different after you eat or after you sleep.,They really tell us what's going on there.,And so this picture,,which looks like a big smudge to you,,is actually the thing that got me really thrilled about this,and made me feel like we were on the right track.,So if I zoom into that picture,,I can just show you what it means.,We sort out the proteins -- from left to right,is the weight of the fragments that we're getting,,and from top to bottom is how slippery they are.,So we're zooming in here just to show you a little bit of it.,And so each of these lines,represents some signal that we're getting out of a piece of a protein.,And you can see how the lines occur,in these little groups of bump, bump, bump, bump, bump.,And that's because we're measuring the weight so precisely that --,carbon comes in different isotopes,,so if it has an extra neutron on it,,we actually measure it as a different chemical.,So we're actually measuring each isotope as a different one. 
 And so that gives you an idea,of how exquisitely sensitive this is.,So seeing this picture,is sort of like getting to be Galileo,and looking at the stars,and looking through the telescope for the first time,,and suddenly you say, "Wow, it's way more complicated than we thought it was.",But we can see that stuff out there,and actually see features of it.,So this is the signature out of which we're trying to get patterns.,So what we do with this,is, for example, we can look at two patients,,one that responded to a drug and one that didn't respond to a drug,,and ask, "What's going on differently,inside of them?",And so we can make these measurements precisely enough,that we can overlay two patients and look at the differences. 
 So here we have Alice in green,and Bob in red.,We overlay them. This is actual data.,And you can see, mostly it overlaps and it's yellow,,but there's some things that just Alice has,and some things that just Bob has.,And if we find a pattern of things,of the responders to the drug,,we see that in the blood,,they have the condition,that allows them to respond to this drug.,We might not even know what this protein is,,but we can see it's a marker,for the response to the disease.,So this already, I think,,is tremendously useful in all kinds of medicine.,But I think this is actually,just the beginning,of how we're going to treat cancer.,So let me move to cancer. 
 The thing about cancer --,when I got into this,,I really knew nothing about it,,but working with David Agus,,I started watching how cancer was actually being treated,and went to operations where it was being cut out.,And as I looked at it,,to me it didn't make sense,how we were approaching cancer,,and in order to make sense of it,,I had to learn where did this come from.,We're treating cancer almost like it's an infectious disease.,We're treating it as something that got inside of you,that we have to kill.,So this is the great paradigm.,This is another case,where a theoretical paradigm in biology really worked --,was the germ theory of disease.,So what doctors are mostly trained to do,is diagnose --,that is, put you into a category,and apply a scientifically proven treatment,for that diagnosis --,and that works great for infectious diseases.,So if we put you in the category,of you've got syphilis, we can give you penicillin.,We know that that works.,If you've got malaria, we give you quinine,or some derivative of it.,And so that's the basic thing doctors are trained to do,,and it's miraculous,in the case of infectious disease --,how well it works.,And many people in this audience probably wouldn't be alive,if doctors didn't do this. 
 But now let's apply that,to systems diseases like cancer.,The problem is that, in cancer,,there isn't something else,that's inside of you.,It's you; you're broken.,That conversation inside of you,got mixed up in some way.,So how do we diagnose that conversation?,Well, right now what we do is we divide it by part of the body --,you know, where did it appear? --,and we put you in different categories,according to the part of the body.,And then we do a clinical trial,for a drug for lung cancer,and one for prostate cancer and one for breast cancer,,and we treat these as if they're separate diseases,and that this way of dividing them,had something to do with what actually went wrong.,And of course, it really doesn't have that much to do,with what went wrong,because cancer is a failure of the system.,And in fact, I think we're even wrong,when we talk about cancer as a thing.,I think this is the big mistake.,I think cancer should not be a noun.,We should talk about cancering,as something we do, not something we have.,And so those tumors,,those are symptoms of cancer.,And so your body is probably cancering all the time,,but there are lots of systems in your body,that keep it under control. 
 And so to give you an idea,of an analogy of what I mean,by thinking of cancering as a verb,,imagine we didn't know anything about plumbing,,and the way that we talked about it,,we'd come home and we'd find a leak in our kitchen,and we'd say, "Oh, my house has water.",We might divide it -- the plumber would say, "Well, where's the water?","Well, it's in the kitchen." "Oh, you must have kitchen water.",That's kind of the level at which it is.,"Kitchen water,,well, first of all, we'll go in there and we'll mop out a lot of it.,And then we know that if we sprinkle Drano around the kitchen,,that helps.,Whereas living room water,,it's better to do tar on the roof.",And it sounds silly,,but that's basically what we do.,And I'm not saying you shouldn't mop up your water if you have cancer,,but I'm saying that's not really the problem;,that's the symptom of the problem. 
 What we really need to get at,is the process that's going on,,and that's happening at the level,of the proteonomic actions,,happening at the level of why is your body not healing itself,in the way that it normally does?,Because normally, your body is dealing with this problem all the time.,So your house is dealing with leaks all the time,,but it's fixing them. It's draining them out and so on.,So what we need,is to have a causative model,of what's actually going on,,and proteomics actually gives us,the ability to build a model like that. 
 David got me invited,to give a talk at National Cancer Institute,and Anna Barker was there.,And so I gave this talk,and said, "Why don't you guys do this?",And Anna said,,"Because nobody within cancer,would look at it this way.,But what we're going to do, is we're going to create a program,for people outside the field of cancer,to get together with doctors,who really know about cancer,and work out different programs of research.",So David and I applied to this program,and created a consortium,at USC,where we've got some of the best oncologists in the world,and some of the best biologists in the world,,from Cold Spring Harbor,,Stanford, Austin --,I won't even go through and name all the places --,to have a research project,that will last for five years,where we're really going to try to build a model of cancer like this.,We're doing it in mice first,,and we will kill a lot of mice,in the process of doing this,,but they will die for a good cause.,And we will actually try to get to the point,where we have a predictive model,where we can understand,,when cancer happens,,what's actually happening in there,and which treatment will treat that cancer. 
 So let me just end with giving you a little picture,of what I think cancer treatment will be like in the future.,So I think eventually,,once we have one of these models for people,,which we'll get eventually --,I mean, our group won't get all the way there --,but eventually we'll have a very good computer model --,sort of like a global climate model for weather.,It has lots of different information,about what's the process going on in this proteomic conversation,on many different scales.,And so we will simulate,in that model,for your particular cancer --,and this also will be for ALS,,or any kind of system neurodegenerative diseases,,things like that --,we will simulate,specifically you,,not just a generic person,,but what's actually going on inside you. 
 And in that simulation, what we could do,is design for you specifically,a sequence of treatments,,and it might be very gentle treatments, very small amounts of drugs.,It might be things like, don't eat that day,,or give them a little chemotherapy,,maybe a little radiation.,Of course, we'll do surgery sometimes and so on.,But design a program of treatments specifically for you,and help your body,guide back to health --,guide your body back to health.,Because your body will do most of the work of fixing it,if we just sort of prop it up in the ways that are wrong.,We put it in the equivalent of splints.,And so your body basically has lots and lots of mechanisms,for fixing cancer,,and we just have to prop those up in the right way,and get them to do the job. 
 And so I believe that this will be the way,that cancer will be treated in the future.,It's going to require a lot of work,,a lot of research.,There will be many teams like our team,that work on this.,But I think eventually,,we will design for everybody,a custom treatment for cancer. 
 So thank you very much. 
 (Applause)My name is Emiliano Salinas,and I'm going to talk about the role,we members of society play,in the violent atmosphere,this country is living in right now.,I was born in 1976.,I grew up in a traditional Mexican family.,As a child, I had a pretty normal life:,I would go to school, play with my friends and cousins.,But then my father became President of Mexico,and my life changed. 
 What I'm about to say,,at least some of what I'm about to say,,will cause controversy.,Firstly, because I'm the one who's going to say it.,And secondly, because what I'm going to say is true,,and it will make a lot of people nervous,because it's something we don't want to hear.,But it's imperative that we listen,because it's undeniable and definitive.,It will also make members of,criminal organizations nervous,for the same reasons.,I'm going to talk about the role,we members of society play,in this phenomenon,,and about four different response levels,we citizens have against violence.,I know many will find it difficult to separate the fact,that I'm Carlos Salinas de Gortari's son,from the fact that I'm a citizen,concerned about the country's current situation.,Don't worry.,It's not necessary for understanding,the importance of what I'm going to say. 
 I think we have a problem in Mexico.,We have a big problem.,I think there's consensus on this.,No one argues --,we all agree there's a problem.,What we don't agree on,is what the problem actually is.,Is it the Zetas? The drug traffickers? The government?,Corruption? Poverty? Or is it something else?,I think none of these is the problem.,I don't mean they don't deserve attention.,But we won't be able to take care of any of those things,if we don't solve the real problem,we have in Mexico first. 
 The real problem we have is,most of us Mexicans, we believe we are victims,of our circumstances.,We are a country of victims.,Historically, we've always acted as victims,of something or somebody.,We were victims of the Spaniards.,Then we were victims of the French.,Then we were victims of Don Porfirio.,Then we were victims of the PRI.,Even of Salinas.,And of El Peje.,And now of the Zetas and the traffickers and the criminals and the kidnappers ...,Hold on! Wait a minute!,What if none of these things is the problem?,The problem is not the things we feel victims of.,The problem is that we play the role of victims.,We need to open our eyes and see that we are not victims.,If only we stopped feeling like victims,,if we stopped acting as victims,,our country would change so much! 
 I'm going to talk about how to go from a society,that acts as a victim of circumstances,to a responsible, involved society,that takes the future of its country in its own hands.,I'm going to talk about four different levels,of civil response against violence,,from weakest,to strongest.,The first level, the weakest level of civil response against violence,,is denial and apathy.,Today, much of Mexican society is in denial,of the situation we're going through.,We want to go on with our daily life,even though we are not living under normal circumstances.,Daily life in our country is,,to say the least,,under extraordinary, exceptional circumstances.,It's like someone who has a serious illness,and pretends it's the flu,and it will just go away.,We want to pretend that Mexico has the flu.,But it doesn't.,Mexico has cancer.,And if we don't do something about it,,the cancer will end up killing it. 
 We need to move Mexican society,from denial and apathy,to the next level of citizen response,,which is, effectively, recognition.,And that recognition will sow fear --,recognizing the seriousness of the situation.,But, fear is better than apathy,because fear makes us do something.,Many people in Mexico,are afraid today.,We're very afraid.,And we're acting out of that fear.,And let me tell you what the problem is,with acting out of fear --,and this is the second level of civil response:,fear. 
 Let's think about Mexican streets:,they're unsafe because of violence,,so people stay at home.,Does that make streets more or less safe?,Less safe!,So streets become more desolate and unsafe,,so we stay home more --,which makes streets even more desolate and unsafe,,and we stay home even more.,This vicious circle ends up with the whole population,stuck inside their houses, scared to death --,even more afraid than when we were out on the streets.,We need to confront this fear.,We need to move Mexican society,,the members of society who are at this level,,to the next level, which is action. 
 We need to face our fears and take back our streets,,our cities, our neighborhoods.,For many people, acting involves courage.,We go from fear to courage.,They say, "I can't take it anymore.,Let's do something about it.",Recently --,this is a sensitive figure --,35 public lynchings have been recorded,so far in 2010,in Mexico.,Usually it's one or two a year.,Now we're experiencing one every week.,This shows that society is desperate,and it's taking the law into its own hands.,Unfortunately, violent action --,though action is better than no action --,but taking part in it,only disguises violence.,If I'm violent with you,and you respond with violence,,you become part of the violence,and you just disguise my violence. 
 So civil action,is vital,,but it's also vital to take people,who are at the level of courage,and violent action,to the next level,,which is non-violent action.,It's pacific, coordinated civil action,,which doesn't mean passive action.,It means it's determined and effective,,but not violent.,There are examples of this kind of action in Mexico.,Two years ago, in Galena City, Chihuahua,,a member of the community was kidnapped,,Eric Le Barón.,His brothers, Benjamín and Julián,,got together with the rest of the community,to think of the best course of action:,to pay the ransom,,to take up arms and go after the kidnappers,or to ask the government for help. 
 In the end, Benjamín and Julián decided,the best thing they could do,was to organize the community and act together.,So what did they do?,They mobilized the whole community of Le Barón,to go to Chihuahua,,where they organized a sit-in,in the central park of the city.,They sent a message to the kidnappers:,"If you want your ransom come and get it.,We'll be waiting for you right here.",They stayed there.,Seven days later, Eric was set free,and was able to return home.,This is an example of what an organized society can do,,a society that acts. 
 Of course, criminals can respond.,And in this case, they did.,On July 7th, 2009,,Benjamín Le Barón was murdered.,But Julián Le Barón keeps working,and he has been mobilizing communities in Chihuahua,for over a year.,And for over a year he has known that a price has been put on his head.,But he keeps fighting.,He keeps organizing.,He keeps mobilizing.,These heroic acts are present all over the country.,With a thousand Juliáns working together,,Mexico would be a very different country.,And they're out there!,They just have to raise their hands.,I was born in Mexico, I grew up in Mexico,and along the way, I learned to love Mexico.,I think anyone who has stepped foot on this land --,not to mention all Mexican people --,will agree that it's not difficult,to love Mexico. 
 I've traveled a lot,and nowhere else have I found the passion Mexicans have.,That devotion we feel,for the national football team.,That devotion we show,in helping victims of disasters,,such as the earthquake in 1985,or this year's floods.,The passion with which we've been singing the national anthem,since we were kids.,When we thought Masiosare,was the strange enemy,,and we sang, with a childlike heart,,"a soldier in each son.",I think the biggest insult,,the worst way you can offend a Mexican,is to insult their mother.,A mother is the most sacred thing in life.,Mexico is our mother and today she cries out for her children.,We are going through the darkest moment,in our recent history.,Our mother, Mexico, is being violated before our very eyes.,What are we going to do?,Masiosare, the strange enemy, is here.,Where is the soldier in each son? 
 Mahatma Gandhi,,one of the greatest civil fighters of all time, said,,"Be the change you wish to see in the world.",Today in Mexico we're asking for Gandhis.,We need Gandhis.,We need men and women who love Mexico,and who are willing to take action.,This is a call for every true Mexican,to join this initiative.,This is a call,so that every single thing we love about Mexico --,the festivals, the markets,,the restaurants, the cantinas,,the tequila, the mariachis, the serenades,,the posadas, El Grito, the Day of the Dead,,San Miguel, the joy, the passion for life,,the fight and everything it means to be Mexican --,doesn't disappear from this world. 
 We're facing a very powerful opponent.,But we are many more.,They can take a man's life.,Anyone can kill me,,or you, or you.,But no one can kill,the spirit of true Mexicans.,The battle is won,,but we still have to fight it.,2000 years ago, the Roman poet Juvenal,said something that today echoes,in the heart of every true Mexican.,He said, "Count it the greatest sin,to prefer life to honor,,and for the sake of living,to lose what makes life worth living.",Thank you.,(Applause)(Applause)

 Thank you. 
 (Applause)It's Monday morning.,In Washington,,the president of the United States,is sitting in the Oval Office,,assessing whether or not,to strike Al Qaeda,in Yemen.,At Number 10 Downing Street,,David Cameron is trying to work out,whether to cut more public sector jobs,in order to stave off a double-dip recession.,In Madrid, Maria Gonzalez,is standing at the door,,listening to her baby crying and crying,,trying to work out whether she should let it cry,until it falls asleep,or pick it up and hold it.,And I am sitting by my father's bedside in hospital,,trying to work out,whether I should let him drink,the one-and-a-half-liter bottle of water,that his doctors just came in and said,,"You must make him drink today," --,my father's been nil by mouth for a week --,or whether, by giving him this bottle,,I might actually kill him. 
 We face momentous decisions,with important consequences,throughout our lives,,and we have strategies for dealing with these decisions.,We talk things over with our friends,,we scour the Internet,,we search through books.,But still,,even in this age,of Google and TripAdvisor,and Amazon Recommends,,it's still experts,that we rely upon most --,especially when the stakes are high,and the decision really matters.,Because in a world of data deluge,and extreme complexity,,we believe that experts,are more able to process information than we can --,that they are able to come to better conclusions,than we could come to on our own.,And in an age,that is sometimes nowadays frightening,or confusing,,we feel reassured,by the almost parental-like authority,of experts,who tell us so clearly what it is,we can and cannot do. 
 But I believe,that this is a big problem,,a problem with potentially dangerous consequences,for us as a society,,as a culture,and as individuals.,It's not that experts,have not massively contributed to the world --,of course they have.,The problem lies with us:,we've become addicted to experts.,We've become addicted to their certainty,,their assuredness,,their definitiveness,,and in the process,,we have ceded our responsibility,,substituting our intellect,and our intelligence,for their supposed words of wisdom.,We've surrendered our power,,trading off our discomfort,with uncertainty,for the illusion of certainty,that they provide.,This is no exaggeration.,In a recent experiment,,a group of adults,had their brains scanned in an MRI machine,as they were listening to experts speak.,The results were quite extraordinary.,As they listened to the experts' voices,,the independent decision-making parts of their brains,switched off.,It literally flat-lined.,And they listened to whatever the experts said,and took their advice, however right or wrong. 
 But experts do get things wrong.,Did you know that studies show,that doctors misdiagnose,four times out of 10?,Did you know,that if you file your tax returns yourself,,you're statistically more likely,to be filing them correctly,than if you get a tax adviser,to do it for you?,And then there's, of course, the example,that we're all too aware of:,financial experts,getting it so wrong,that we're living through the worst recession,since the 1930s.,For the sake of our health,,our wealth,and our collective security,,it's imperative that we keep,the independent decision-making parts of our brains,switched on.,And I'm saying this as an economist,who, over the past few years,,has focused my research,on what it is we think,and who it is we trust and why,,but also --,and I'm aware of the irony here --,as an expert myself,,as a professor,,as somebody who advises prime ministers,,heads of big companies,,international organizations,,but an expert who believes,that the role of experts needs to change,,that we need to become more open-minded,,more democratic,and be more open,to people rebelling against,our points of view.,So in order to help you understand,where I'm coming from,,let me bring you into my world,,the world of experts. 
 Now there are, of course, exceptions,,wonderful, civilization-enhancing exceptions.,But what my research has shown me,is that experts tend on the whole,to form very rigid camps,,that within these camps,,a dominant perspective emerges,that often silences opposition,,that experts move with the prevailing winds,,often hero-worshipping,their own gurus.,Alan Greenspan's proclamations,that the years of economic growth,would go on and on,,not challenged by his peers,,until after the crisis, of course.,You see,,we also learn,that experts are located,,are governed,,by the social and cultural norms,of their times --,whether it be the doctors,in Victorian England, say,,who sent women to asylums,for expressing sexual desire,,or the psychiatrists in the United States,who, up until 1973,,were still categorizing homosexuality,as a mental illness. 
 And what all this means,is that paradigms,take far too long to shift,,that complexity and nuance are ignored,and also that money talks --,because we've all seen the evidence,of pharmaceutical companies,funding studies of drugs,that conveniently leave out,their worst side effects,,or studies funded by food companies,of their new products,,massively exaggerating the health benefits,of the products they're about to bring by market.,The study showed that food companies exaggerated,typically seven times more,than an independent study. 
 And we've also got to be aware,that experts, of course,,also make mistakes.,They make mistakes every single day --,mistakes born out of carelessness.,A recent study in the Archives of Surgery,reported surgeons,removing healthy ovaries,,operating on the wrong side of the brain,,carrying out procedures on the wrong hand,,elbow, eye, foot,,and also mistakes born out of thinking errors.,A common thinking error,of radiologists, for example --,when they look at CT scans --,is that they're overly influenced,by whatever it is,that the referring physician has said,that he suspects,the patient's problem to be.,So if a radiologist,is looking at the scan,of a patient with suspected pneumonia, say,,what happens is that,,if they see evidence,of pneumonia on the scan,,they literally stop looking at it --,thereby missing the tumor,sitting three inches below,on the patient's lungs. 
 I've shared with you so far,some insights into the world of experts.,These are, of course,,not the only insights I could share,,but I hope they give you a clear sense at least,of why we need to stop kowtowing to them,,why we need to rebel,and why we need to switch,our independent decision-making capabilities on.,But how can we do this?,Well for the sake of time,,I want to focus on just three strategies.,First, we've got to be ready and willing,to take experts on,and dispense with this notion of them,as modern-day apostles.,This doesn't mean having to get a Ph.D.,in every single subject,,you'll be relieved to hear.,But it does mean persisting,in the face of their inevitable annoyance,when, for example,,we want them to explain things to us,in language that we can actually understand.,Why was it that, when I had an operation,,my doctor said to me,,"Beware, Ms. Hertz,,of hyperpyrexia,",when he could have just as easily said,,"Watch out for a high fever.",You see, being ready to take experts on,is about also being willing,to dig behind their graphs,,their equations, their forecasts,,their prophecies,,and being armed with the questions to do that --,questions like:,What are the assumptions that underpin this?,What is the evidence upon which this is based?,What has your investigation focused on?,And what has it ignored? 
 It recently came out,that experts trialing drugs,before they come to market,typically trial drugs,first, primarily on male animals,and then, primarily on men.,It seems that they've somehow overlooked the fact,that over half the world's population are women.,And women have drawn the short medical straw,because it now turns out that many of these drugs,don't work nearly as well on women,as they do on men --,and the drugs that do work well work so well,that they're actively harmful for women to take.,Being a rebel is about recognizing,that experts' assumptions,and their methodologies,can easily be flawed. 
 Second,,we need to create the space,for what I call "managed dissent.",If we are to shift paradigms,,if we are to make breakthroughs,,if we are to destroy myths,,we need to create an environment,in which expert ideas are battling it out,,in which we're bringing in,new, diverse, discordant, heretical views,into the discussion,,fearlessly,,in the knowledge that progress comes about,,not only from the creation of ideas,,but also from their destruction --,and also from the knowledge,that, by surrounding ourselves,by divergent, discordant,,heretical views.,All the research now shows us,that this actually makes us smarter.,Encouraging dissent is a rebellious notion,because it goes against our very instincts,,which are to surround ourselves,with opinions and advice,that we already believe,or want to be true.,And that's why I talk about the need,to actively manage dissent. 
 Google CEO Eric Schmidt,is a practical practitioner,of this philosophy.,In meetings, he looks out for the person in the room --,arms crossed, looking a bit bemused --,and draws them into the discussion,,trying to see if they indeed are,the person with a different opinion,,so that they have dissent within the room.,Managing dissent,is about recognizing the value,of disagreement, discord,and difference.,But we need to go even further.,We need to fundamentally redefine,who it is that experts are.,The conventional notion,is that experts are people,with advanced degrees,,fancy titles, diplomas,,best-selling books --,high-status individuals.,But just imagine,if we were to junk,this notion of expertise,as some sort of elite cadre,and instead embrace the notion,of democratized expertise --,whereby expertise was not just the preserve,of surgeons and CEO's,,but also shop-girls -- yeah. 
 Best Buy,,the consumer electronics company,,gets all its employees --,the cleaners, the shop assistants,,the people in the back office,,not just its forecasting team --,to place bets, yes bets,,on things like whether or not,a product is going to sell well before Christmas,,on whether customers' new ideas,are going to be or should be taken on by the company,,on whether a project,will come in on time.,By leveraging,and by embracing,the expertise within the company,,Best Buy was able to discover, for example,,that the store that it was going to open in China --,its big, grand store --,was not going to open on time.,Because when it asked its staff,,all its staff, to place their bets,on whether they thought the store would open on time or not,,a group from the finance department,placed all their chips,on that not happening.,It turned out that they were aware,,as no one else within the company was,,of a technological blip,that neither the forecasting experts,,nor the experts on the ground in China,,were even aware of. 
 The strategies,that I have discussed this evening --,embracing dissent,,taking experts on,,democratizing expertise,,rebellious strategies --,are strategies that I think,would serve us all well to embrace,as we try to deal with the challenges,of these very confusing, complex,,difficult times.,For if we keep,our independent decision-making part,of our brains switched on,,if we challenge experts, if we're skeptical,,if we devolve authority,,if we are rebellious,,but also,if we become much more comfortable,with nuance,,uncertainty and doubt,,and if we allow our experts,to express themselves,using those terms too,,we will set ourselves up,much better,for the challenges of the 21st century.,For now, more than ever,,is not the time,to be blindly following,,blindly accepting,,blindly trusting.,Now is the time to face the world,with eyes wide open --,yes, using experts,to help us figure things out, for sure --,I don't want to completely do myself out of a job here --,but being aware,of their limitations,and, of course, also our own. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)This is a river.,This is a stream.,This is a river.,This is happening all over the country.,There are tens of thousands of milesnof dewatered streams in the United States.,On this map, the colored areasnrepresent water conflicts.,Similar problemsnare emerging in the East as well.,The reasons vary state to state,nbut mostly in the details.,There are 4,000 milesnof dewatered streams in Montana alone.,They would ordinarilynsupport fish and other wildlife.,They're the veins of the ecosystem,,and they're often empty veins. 
 I want to tell you the storynof just one of these streams,,because it's an archetypenfor the larger story.,This is Prickly Pear Creek.,It runs through a populated areanfrom East Helena to Lake Helena.,It supports wild fish including cutthroat,nbrown and rainbow trout.,Nearly every yearnfor more than a hundred years ...,it looked like this in the summer.,How did we get here?,Well, it started back in the late 1800s,when people started settlingnin places like Montana.,In short, there was a lot of waternand there weren't very many people.,But as more peoplenshowed up wanting water,,the folks who were there firstngot a little concerned,,and in 1865, Montana passednits first water law.,It basically said, everybodynnear the stream can share in the stream.,Oddly, a lot of people showed upnwanting to share the stream,,and the folks who were there first,got concerned enoughnto bring out their lawyers.,There were precedent-setting suitsnin 1870 and 1872,,both involving Prickly Pear Creek.,And in 1921,,the Montana Supreme Courtnruled in a case involving Prickly Pear,that the folks who were there firstnhad the first, or "senior water rights.",These senior water rights are key. 
 The problem is that all over the Westnnow it looks like this.,Some of these creeks have claims,for 50 to 100 times more waternthan is actually in the stream.,And the senior water rights holders,nif they don't use their water right,,they risk losing their water right --,along with the economic valuenthat goes with it.,So they have no incentive to conserve.,So it's not justnabout the number of people;,the system itself createsna disincentive to conserve,because you can lose your waternright if you don't use it.,So after decades of lawsuitsnand 140 years, now, of experience,,we still have this.,It's a broken system.,There's a disincentive to conserve,,because if you don't use your water right,nyou can lose your water right.,And I'm sure you all know,nthis has created significant conflicts,between the agriculturalnand environmental communities. 
 OK, now I'm going to change gears here.,Most of you will be happy to know thatnthe rest of the presentation's free ... 
 (Laughter) 
 and some of you'll be happynto know that it involves beer. 
 (Laughter) 
 There's another thingnhappening around the country,,which is that companiesnare starting to get concerned,about their water footprint.,They're concerned about securingnan adequate supply of water,,they're trying to be really efficientnwith their water use,,and they're concernednabout how their water use,affects the image of their brand.,Well, it's a national problem,,but I'm going to tell younanother story from Montana ...,and it involves beer.,I bet you didn't know,nit takes about 5 pints of water,to make a pint of beer.,If you include all the drain,,it takes more than a hundred pintsnof water to make a pint of beer. 
 Now the brewers in Montana,have already done a lotnto reduce their water consumption,,but they still usenmillions of gallons of water.,I mean, there's water in beer.,So what can they donabout this remaining water footprint,that can have serious effectsnon the ecosystem?,These ecosystems are really important,to the Montana brewersnand their customers.,After all, there's a strong correlationnbetween water and fishing,,and for some, there's a strong correlationnbetween fishing and beer. 
 (Laughter) 
 So the Montana brewersnand their customers are concerned,and they're looking for some waynto address the problem. 
 So how can they addressnthis remaining water footprint?,Remember Prickly Pear.,Up until now, business water stewardship,has been limitednto measuring and reducing,,and we're suggestingnthat the next step is to restore.,Remember Prickly Pear.,It's a broken system.,You've got a disincentive to conserve,,because if you don't use your water right,nyou risk losing your water right.,Well, we decided to connectnthese two worlds --,the world of the companiesnwith their water footprints,and the world of the farmers,with their senior water rightsnon these creeks.,In some states,,senior water rights holdersncan leave their water in the stream,while legally protecting it from others,,and maintaining their water right.,After all, it is their water right,,and if they want to use that water rightnto help the fish grow in the stream,,it's their right to do so.,But they have no incentive to do so. 
 So, working with local water trusts,nwe created an incentive to do so.,We pay them to leaventheir water in stream.,That's what's happening here.,This individual has made the choicenand is closing this water diversion,,leaving the water in the stream.,He doesn't lose the water right,,he just chooses to apply that right,nor some portion of it,,to the stream, instead of to the land.,Because he's the seniornwater-rights holder,,he can protect the waternfrom other users in the stream.,OK?,He gets paid to leaventhe water in the stream. 
 This guy's measuring the waternthat this leaves in the stream.,We then take the measured water,,we divide it intonthousand-gallon increments.,Each increment gets a serial numbernand a certificate,,and then the brewers and othersnbuy those certificates,as a way to return waternto these degraded ecosystems.,The brewers paynto restore water to the stream.,It provides a simple,ninexpensive and measurable way,to return waternto these degraded ecosystems,,while giving farmers an economic choice,and giving businessesnconcerned about their water footprints,an easy way to deal with them. 
 After 140 years of conflictnand 100 years of dry streams,,a circumstance that litigationnand regulation has not solved,,we put together a market-based,nwilling buyer, willing seller solution --,a solution thatndoes not require litigation.,It's about giving folksnconcerned about their water footprints,a real opportunity to put waternwhere it's critically needed,,into these degraded ecosystems,,while at the same time providing farmersna meaningful economic choice,about how their water is used. 
 These transactionsncreate allies, not enemies.,They connect peoplenrather than dividing them.,And they provide needed economicnsupport for rural communities.,And most importantly, it's working.,We've returned more than four billionngallons of water to degraded ecosystems.,We've connected seniornwater-rights holders,with brewers in Montana,,with hotels and tea companies in Oregon,,and with high-tech companiesnthat use a lot of water in the Southwest.,And when we make these connections,,we can and we do turn this ...,into this. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)So I am a surgeon who studies creativity,,and I have never had a patient tell me,,"I really want younto be creative during surgery,",and so I guessnthere's a little bit of irony to it.,I will say though that,nafter having done surgery a lot,,it's similar to playingna musical instrument.,And for me, this deepnand enduring fascination with sound,is what led me to both be a surgeon,and to study the sciencenof sound, particularly music.,I'm going to talknover the next few minutes,about my career,in terms of how I'm able to study music,and try to grapplenwith all these questions,of how the brain is able to be creative.,I've done most of this worknat Johns Hopkins University,,and at the National Institutenof Health where I was previously.,I'll go over some science experimentsnand cover three musical experiments. 
 I will start off by playingna video for you.,This video is of Keith Jarrett,nwho's a well-known jazz improviser,and probably the mostnwell-known, iconic example,of someone who takes improvisationnto a higher level.,And he'll improvise entire concertsnoff the top of his head,,and he'll never play itnexactly the same way again,,so as a form of intense creativity,,I think this is a great example.,And so why don't we gonand click the video. 
 (Music) 
 (Music ends) 
 It's really a remarkablenthing that happens there.,I've always as a listener, as a fan,,I listen to that, and I'm astounded.,I think -- how can this possibly be?,How can the brain generatenthat much information,,that much music, spontaneously?,And so I set outnwith this concept, scientifically,,that artistic creativity,nit's magical, but it's not magic,,meaning that it's a product of the brain.,There's not too many brain-deadnpeople creating art.,With this notion that artistic creativitynis in fact a neurologic product,,I took this thesis that we could study it,just like we study any otherncomplex neurologic process,,and there are subquestionsnthat I put there.,Is it possible to studyncreativity scientifically?,And I think that's a good question.,And I'll tell you that mostnscientific studies of music,,they're very dense,,and when you go through them,,it's very hard to recognizenthe music in it.,In fact, they seem to benunmusical entirely,and to miss the point of the music. 
 This brings the second question:,Why should scientists study creativity?,Maybe we're not the right people to do it. 
 (Laughter) 
 Well it may be, but I will say that,nfrom a scientific perspective,,we talked a lot about innovation today,,the science of innovation,,how much we understandnabout how the brain is able to innovate,is in its infancy,,and truly, we know very littlenabout how we are able to be creative.,I think that we're going to see,,over the next 10, 20, 30 years,,a real science of creativitynthat's burgeoning,and is going to flourish,,Because we now have new methodsnthat can enable us,to take this processnlike complex jazz improvisation,,and study it rigorously.,So it gets down to the brain.,All of us have this remarkable brain,,which is poorly understood,nto say the least.,I think that neuroscientistsnhave more questions than answers,,and I'm not goingnto give you answers today,,just ask a lot of questions. 
 And that's what I do in my lab.,I ask questions about what is the brainndoing to enable us to do this.,This is the main method that I use.nThis is functional MRI.,If you've been in an MRI scanner,nit's very much the same,,but this one is outfitted in a special waynto not just take pictures of your brain,,but to also take picturesnof active areas of the brain.,The way that's done is by the following:,There's something called BOLD imaging,,which is Blood OxygennLevel Dependent imaging.,When you're in an fMRI scanner,nyou're in a big magnet,that's aligning your moleculesnin certain areas.,When an area of the brain is active,nmeaning a neural area is active,,it gets blood flow shunted to that area.,That blood flow causes an increasenin local blood to that area,with a deoxyhemoglobinnchange in concentration.,Deoxyhemoglobin can be detected by MRI,,whereas oxyhemoglobin can't.,So through this method of inference --,and we're measuring blood flow,nnot neural activity --,we say that an area of the brainnthat's getting more blood,was active during a particular task,nand that's the crux of how fMRI works.,And it's been used since the '90snto study really complex processes. 
 I'm going to review a study that I did,nwhich was jazz in an fMRI scanner.,It was done with a colleague,nAlan Braun, at the NIH.,This is a short videonof how we did this project. 
 (Video) Charles Limb: This is a plasticnMIDI piano keyboard,that we use for the jazz experiments.,And it's a 35-key keyboard,designed to fit both inside the scanner,,be magnetically safe,,have minimal interferencenthat would contribute to any artifact,,and have this cushionnso that it can rest on the players' legs,while they're lying down in the scanner,nplaying on their back.,It works like this --nthis doesn't actually produce any sound.,It sends out what's calledna MIDI signal --,or a Musical InstrumentnDigital Interface --,through these wires into the boxnand then the computer,,which then triggernhigh-quality piano samples like this. 
 (Music) 
 (Music) 
 (Music ends) 
 OK, so it works.,And so through this piano keyboard,,we have the means to takena musical process and study it.,So what do you do now that you haventhis cool piano keyboard?,You can't just say,n"It's great we have a keyboard.",We have to come upnwith a scientific experiment.,The experimentnreally rests on the following:,What happens in the brain during somethingnthat's memorized and over-learned,,and what happens in the brainnduring something,that is spontaneouslyngenerated, or improvised,,in a way that's matched motorically,and in terms of lower-levelnsensory motor features? 
 I have here what we call the paradigms.,There's a scale paradigm, which is playingna scale up and down, memorized,,then there's improvising on a scale,,quarter notes, metronome, right hand --,scientifically very safe,,but musically really boring.,Then there's the bottom one,nwhich is called the jazz paradigm.,So we brought professionalnjazz players to the NIH,,and we had them memorizenthis piece of music on the lower-left,,which is what you heard me playing --,and we had them improvisento the same chord changes.,And if you can hitnthat lower-right sound icon,,that's an examplenof what was recorded in the scanner. 
 (Music) 
 (Music ends) 
 In the end, it's not the mostnnatural environment,,but they're able to play real music.,And I've listened to that solo 200 times,,and I still like it.,And the musiciansnwere comfortable in the end.,We first measured the number of notes.,Were they playing more notesnwhen they were improvising?,That was not what was going on.,And then we looked at the brain activity.,I will try to condense this for you.,These are contrast maps that are showingnsubtractions between what changes,when you're improvisingnvs. when you're doing something memorized.,In red is an area that's activenin the prefrontal cortex,,the frontal lobe of the brain,,and in blue is this areanthat was deactivated.,So we had this focal areancalled the medial prefrontal cortex,that went way up in activity.,We had this broad patch of areancalled the lateral prefrontal cortex,that went way down in activity,,I'll summarize that for you. 
 These are multifunctionalnareas of the brain,,these are not the jazz areas of the brain.,They do a whole host of things,that have to do with self-reflection,,introspection, working memory etc.,Really, consciousness is seatednin the frontal lobe.,But we have this combination,of an area that's thought to be involvednin self-monitoring, turning off,,and this area that's thoughtnto be autobiographical,,or self-expressive, turning on.,We think, at least in this preliminary --,it's one study; it's probably wrong,nbut it's one study -- 
 (Laughter) 
 we think that at leastna reasonable hypothesis,is that, to be creative,,you should have this weird dissociationnin your frontal lobe.,One area turns on,nand a big area shuts off,,so that you're not inhibited,nyou're willing to make mistakes,,so that you're not constantlynshutting down,all of these new generative impulses.,Now a lot of people know that musicnis not always a solo activity --,sometimes it's done communicatively. 
 The next question was:,What happens when musiciansnare trading back and forth,,something called "trading fours,",which is something they donnormally in a jazz experiment.,So this is a 12-bar blues,,and I've broken itndown into four-bar groups,,so you would know how you would trade.,We brought a musicianninto the scanner, same way,,had them memorize this melody,then had another musiciannout in the control room,trading back and forth interactively. 
 So this is a musician, Mike Pope,,one of the world's best bassistsnand a fantastic piano player. 
 (Music) 
 He's now playing the piecenthat we just saw,a little better than I wrote it. 
 (Video) CL: Mike, come on in. 
 Mike Pope: May the force be with you. 
 Nurse: Nothing in your pockets, Mike? 
 MP: No. Nothing's in my pockets. 
 CL: You have to have the rightnattitude to agree to do it. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's kind of fun, actually. 
 (Music) 
 Now we're playing back and forth.,He's in there.nYou can see his legs up there. 
 (Music) 
 And then I'm in the control room here,nplaying back and forth. 
 (Music) 
 (Music ends) 
 (Video) Mike Pope:nThis is a pretty good representation,of what it's like.,And it's good that it's not too quick.,The fact that we do it over and over again,lets you acclimate to your surroundings.,So the hardest thing for menwas the kinesthetic thing,,looking at my hands through two mirrors,,laying on my back,,and not able to move at allnexcept for my hand.,That was challenging.,But again --,there were moments, for sure -- 
 (Laughter) 
 there were moments of real, honest-to-Godnmusical interplay, for sure. 
 CL: At this point,nI'll take a few moments.,So what you're seeing here --,and I'm doing a cardinal sin in science,,which is to show you preliminary data.,This is one subject's data.,This is, in fact, Mike Pope's data.,So what am I showing you here?,When he was trading fours with me,nimprovising vs. memorized,,his language areas lit up,nhis Broca's area,,in the inferior frontal gyrus on the left.,He had it also homologous on the right.,This is an area thought to beninvolved in expressive communication.,This whole notionnthat music is a language --,maybe there's a neurologicnbasis to it after all,,and we can see it when two musiciansnare having a musical conversation.,So we've done this on eight subjects now,,and we're getting all the data together,,hopefully we'll have somethingnto say about it meaningfully. 
 Now when I think about improvisationnand the language, what's next?,Rap, of course, rap -- freestyle.,I've always been fascinated by freestyle.,And let's play this video. 
 (Video) Mos Def: Brown skin I be,nstanding five-ten I be,Rockin' it when I be, in your vicinity,Whole-style synergy, recognize symmetry,Go and try to injure me,nbroke 'em down chemically,Ain't the number 10 MC,ntalk about how been I be,Styled it like Kennedy,nlate like a 10 to three,When I say when I be,ngirls say bend that key cut 
 CL: So there's a lot of analogy,between what takes placenin freestyle rap and jazz.,There are a lot of correlatesnbetween the two forms of music,,I think, in different time periods,nin lot of ways,,rap serves the same social functionnthat jazz used to serve.,So how do you study rap scientifically?,And my colleagues think I'm crazy,nbut I think it's very viable.,This is what you do:,You have a freestyle artist comenand memorize a rap,that you write for them,,that they've never heard before,nand then you have them freestyle.,So I told my lab membersnthat I would rap for TED,,and they said, "No, you won't.",And then I thought -- 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 But here's the thing.,With this big screen,nyou can all rap with me. OK?,So what we had them do,was memorize this lower-leftnsound icon, please.,This is the control condition.nThis is what they memorized. 
 Computer: Memory, thump. 
 CL: Thump of the beat in a known repeat,Rhythm and rhyme, they make me complete,The climb is sublime when I'm on the mic,Spittin' rhymes that hit younlike a lightning strike 
 Computer: Search. 
 CL: I search for the truthnin this eternal quest,My passion's not fashion,nyou can see how I'm dressed,Psychopathic words in my head appear,Whisper these lyrics only I can hear 
 Computer: Art. 
 CL: The art of discoveringnand that which is hovering,Inside the mind of those unconfined,All of these words keepnpouring out like rain,I need a mad scientist to check my brain 
 Computer: Stop. 
 (Applause) 
 I guarantee younthat will never happen again. 
 (Laughter) 
 So now, what's greatnabout these free-stylers,,they will get cued different words.,They don't know what's coming,,but they'll hear something off the cuff.,Go hit that right sound icon,,there will be cued three square words:nlike, not and head.,He doesn't know what's coming.nComputer: Like. 
 Freestyler: I'm like some kind of,extraterrestrial, celestial scene,Back in the days, I used to sitnin pyramids and meditate 
 With two microphones -- Computer: Head,hovering over my head,See if I could still listen,,spittin' off the sound,See what you grinning,I teach the childrennin the back of the classroom,About the message of apocalyptical 
 Computer: Not.,Not really though,n'cause I've got to keep it simple,instrumental,Detrimental playing Super Mario,boxes [unclear] hip hop 
 Computer: Stop. 
 CL: It's an incrediblenthing that's taking place.,It's doing somethingnneurologically remarkable.,Whether or not you likenthe music is irrelevant.,Creatively speaking,nit's just a phenomenal thing.,This is a short videonof how we do this in a scanner. 
 [fMRI of Hip-Hop Rap] 
 (Laughter) 
 (Video) CL: We're here with Emmanuel. 
 CL: That was recordednin the scanner, by the way. 
 (Video) CL: That's Emmanuelnin the scanner.,He's just memorized a rhyme for us. 
 [Control Condition Memorized Verses] 
 Emmanuel: Top of the beat with no repeat,Rhythm and rhyme make me complete,Climb is sublime when I'm on the mic,Spittin' rhymes that'll hit younlike a lightning strike 
 Computer: Search.,I search for the truthnin this eternal quest,I'm passing on fashion;nyou can see how I'm dressed 
 CL: I'm going to stop that there;nso what do we see in his brain?,This is four rappers' brains.,And we do see language areas lighting up,,but then, eyes closed --,when you are freestyling vs. memorizing,,you've got major visual areas lighting up.,You've got major cerebellar activity,nwhich is involved in motor coordination.,You have heightened brain activitynwhen you're doing a comparable task,,when that one task is creativenand the other task is memorized.,It's very preliminary,nbut I think it's kind of cool. 
 To conclude, we've gotna lot of questions to ask,,and like I said, we'll ask questionsnhere, not answer them.,But we want to get at the rootnof what is creative genius neurologically,,and I think, with these methods,nwe're getting close.,And I think, hopefullynin the next 10, 20 years,,you'll see real, meaningful studies,that say science has to catch up to art,,and maybe we're starting now to get there. 
 Thank you for your time, I appreciate it. 
 (Applause)I have been teaching for a long time,,and in doing so,have acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning,that I really wish more people would understand,about the potential of students.,In 1931, my grandmother --,bottom left for you guys over here --,graduated from the eighth grade.,She went to school to get the information,because that's where the information lived.,It was in the books; it was inside the teacher's head;,and she needed to go there to get the information,,because that's how you learned.,Fast-forward a generation:,this is the one-room schoolhouse, Oak Grove,,where my father went to a one-room schoolhouse.,And he again had to travel to the school,to get the information from the teacher,,stored it in the only portable memory he has, which is inside his own head,,and take it with him,,because that is how information was being transported,from teacher to student and then used in the world.,When I was a kid,,we had a set of encyclopedias at my house.,It was purchased the year I was born,,and it was extraordinary,,because I did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information.,The information was inside my house,and it was awesome.,This was different,than either generation had experienced before,,and it changed the way I interacted with information,even at just a small level.,But the information was closer to me.,I could get access to it. 
 In the time that passes,between when I was a kid in high school,and when I started teaching,,we really see the advent of the Internet.,Right about the time that the Internet gets going,as an educational tool,,I take off from Wisconsin,and move to Kansas, small town Kansas,,where I had an opportunity to teach,in a lovely, small-town,,rural Kansas school district,,where I was teaching my favorite subject,,American government.,My first year -- super gung-ho -- going to teach American government,,loved the political system.,Kids in the 12th grade:,not exactly all that enthusiastic,about the American government system.,Year two: learned a few things -- had to change my tactic.,And I put in front of them an authentic experience,that allowed them to learn for themselves.,I didn't tell them what to do or how to do it.,I posed a problem in front of them,,which was to put on an election forum for their own community. 
 They produced flyers. They called offices.,They checked schedules. They were meeting with secretaries.,They produced an election forum booklet,for the entire town to learn more about their candidates.,They invited everyone into the school,for an evening of conversation,about government and politics,and whether or not the streets were done well,,and really had this robust experiential learning.,The older teachers -- more experienced --,looked at me and went,,"Oh, there she is. That's so cute. She's trying to get that done.",(Laughter),"She doesn't know what she's in for.",But I knew that the kids would show up,,and I believed it,,and I told them every week what I expected out of them.,And that night, all 90 kids --,dressed appropriately, doing their job, owning it.,I had to just sit and watch.,It was theirs. It was experiential. It was authentic.,It meant something to them.,And they will step up. 
 From Kansas, I moved on to lovely Arizona,,where I taught in Flagstaff for a number of years,,this time with middle school students.,Luckily, I didn't have to teach them American government.,Could teach them the more exciting topic of geography.,Again, "thrilled" to learn.,But what was interesting,about this position I found myself in in Arizona,,was I had this really,extraordinarily eclectic group of kids to work with,in a truly public school,,and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities.,And one opportunity,was we got to go and meet Paul Rusesabagina,,which is the gentleman,that the movie "Hotel Rwanda" is based after.,And he was going to speak at the high school next door to us.,We could walk there. We didn't even have to pay for the buses.,There was no expense cost. Perfect field trip. 
 The problem then becomes,how do you take seventh- and eighth-graders to a talk about genocide,and deal with the subject in a way,that is responsible and respectful,,and they know what to do with it.,And so we chose to look at Paul Rusesabagina,as an example of a gentleman,who singularly used his life to do something positive.,I then challenged the kids to identify,someone in their own life, or in their own story, or in their own world,,that they could identify that had done a similar thing.,I asked them to produce a little movie about it.,It's the first time we'd done this.,Nobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer,,but they were into it. And I asked them to put their own voice over it.,It was the most awesome moment of revelation,that when you ask kids to use their own voice,and ask them to speak for themselves,,what they're willing to share.,The last question of the assignment is:,how do you plan to use your life,to positively impact other people?,The things that kids will say,when you ask them and take the time to listen,is extraordinary. 
 Fast-forward to Pennsylvania, where I find myself today.,I teach at the Science Leadership Academy,,which is a partnership school between the Franklin Institute,and the school district of Philadelphia.,We are a nine through 12 public school,,but we do school quite differently.,I moved there primarily,to be part of a learning environment,that validated the way that I knew that kids learned,,and that really wanted to investigate,what was possible,when you are willing to let go,of some of the paradigms of the past,,of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school,and when my father was in school and even when I was in school,,and to a moment when we have information surplus.,So what do you do when the information is all around you?,Why do you have kids come to school,if they no longer have to come there to get the information? 
 In Philadelphia we have a one-to-one laptop program,,so the kids are bringing in laptops with them everyday,,taking them home, getting access to information.,And here's the thing that you need to get comfortable with,when you've given the tool,to acquire information to students,,is that you have to be comfortable with this idea,of allowing kids to fail,as part of the learning process.,We deal right now in the educational landscape,with an infatuation,with the culture of one right answer,that can be properly bubbled on the average multiple choice test,,and I am here to share with you:,it is not learning.,That is the absolute wrong thing to ask,,to tell kids to never be wrong.,To ask them to always have the right answer,doesn't allow them to learn.,So we did this project,,and this is one of the artifacts of the project.,I almost never show them off,because of the issue of the idea of failure. 
 My students produced these info-graphics,as a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year,responding to the oil spill.,I asked them to take the examples that we were seeing,of the info-graphics that existed,in a lot of mass media,,and take a look at what were the interesting components of it,,and produce one for themselves,of a different man-made disaster from American history.,And they had certain criteria to do it.,They were a little uncomfortable with it,,because we'd never done this before, and they didn't know exactly how to do it.,They can talk -- they're very smooth,,and they can write very, very well,,but asking them to communicate ideas in a different way,was a little uncomfortable for them.,But I gave them the room to just do the thing.,Go create. Go figure it out.,Let's see what we can do.,And the student that persistently,turns out the best visual product did not disappoint.,This was done in like two or three days.,And this is the work of the student that consistently did it. 
 And when I sat the students down, I said, "Who's got the best one?",And they immediately went, "There it is.",Didn't read anything. "There it is.",And I said, "Well what makes it great?",And they're like, "Oh, the design's good, and he's using good color.,And there's some ... " And they went through all that we processed out loud.,And I said, "Go read it.",And they're like, "Oh, that one wasn't so awesome.",And then we went to another one --,it didn't have great visuals, but it had great information --,and spent an hour talking about the learning process,,because it wasn't about whether or not it was perfect,,or whether or not it was what I could create.,It asked them to create for themselves,,and it allowed them to fail,,process, learn from.,And when we do another round of this in my class this year,,they will do better this time,,because learning,has to include an amount of failure,,because failure is instructional,in the process. 
 There are a million pictures,that I could click through here,,and had to choose carefully -- this is one of my favorites --,of students learning,,of what learning can look like,in a landscape where we let go of the idea,that kids have to come to school to get the information,,but instead, ask them what they can do with it.,Ask them really interesting questions.,They will not disappoint.,Ask them to go to places,,to see things for themselves,,to actually experience the learning,,to play, to inquire.,This is one of my favorite photos,,because this was taken on Tuesday,,when I asked the students to go to the polls.,This is Robbie, and this was his first day of voting,,and he wanted to share that with everybody and do that.,But this is learning too,,because we asked them to go out into real spaces. 
 The main point,is that, if we continue to look at education,as if it's about coming to school,to get the information,and not about experiential learning,,empowering student voice and embracing failure,,we're missing the mark.,And everything that everybody is talking about today,isn't possible if we keep having an educational system,that does not value these qualities,,because we won't get there with a standardized test,,and we won't get there with a culture of one right answer.,We know how to do this better,,and it's time to do better. 
 (Applause)What do you guys think?,For those who watchednSir Ken's memorable TED Talk,,I am a typical example nof what he describes,as "the body as a formnof transport for the head,",a university professor. 
 You might think it was not fair,that I've been lined up to speaknafter these first two talks,to speak about science.,I can't move my body to the beat,,and after a scientistnwho became a philosopher,,I have to talk about hard science.,It could be a very dry subject.,Yet, I feel honored.,Never in my career,,and it's been a long career,,have I had the opportunity to start a talk,feeling so inspired, like this one. 
 Usually, talking about science,is like exercising in a dry place.,However, I've had the pleasure,of being invited to come herento talk about water.,The words "water" and "dry"ndo not match, right?,It is even better to talk aboutnwater in the Amazon,,which is the splendid cradle nof life. Fresh life.,So this is what inspired me.,That's why I'm here,nalthough I'm carrying,my head over here.,I am trying, or will try to conveynthis inspiration.,I hope this story will inspire younand that you'll spread the word. 
 We know that there is controversy.,The Amazon is the "lung of the world,",because of its massive powernto have vital gases exchanged,between the forest and the atmosphere.,We also hear aboutnthe storehouse of biodiversity.,While many believe it,,few know it.,If you go out there, in this marsh,,you'll be amazed at the --,You can barely see the animals.,The Indians say, "The forestnhas more eyes than leaves.",That is true, and I will trynto show you something. 
 But today, I'm going to usena different approach,,one that is inspired by thesentwo initiatives here,,a harmonic one and a philosophical one.,I'll try to use an approachnthat's slightly materialistic,,but it also attempts to conveynthat, in nature, there is,extraordinary philosophy and harmony.,There'll be no music in my presentation,,but I hope you'll all notice the musicnof the reality I'm going to show you.,I'm going to talk about physiology —nnot about lungs,,but other analogies with human physiology,,especially the heart. 
 We'll start,by thinking that water is like blood.,The circulation in our bodyndistributes fresh blood,,which feeds, nurtures and supports us,,and brings the used blood backnto be renewed.,In the Amazon, things happen similarly.,We'll start by talking aboutnthe power of all these processes.,This is an image,of rain in motion.,What you see therenis the years passing in seconds.,Rains all over the world.nWhat do you see?,The equatorial region, in general,,and the Amazon specifically,,is extremely importantnfor the world's climate.,It's a powerful engine.,There is a frantic evaporationntaking place here. 
 If we take a look at this other image,,which shows the water vapor flow,,you have dry air in black,nmoist air in gray,,and clouds in white.,What you see there is an extraordinarynresurgence in the Amazon.,What phenomenon -- if it's not a desert,,what phenomenon makes waterngush from the ground into the atmosphere,with such power nthat it can be seen from space?,What phenomenon is this?,It could be a geyser.,A geyser is underground waternheated by magma,,exploding into the atmosphere,and transferring this water ninto the atmosphere.,There are no geysers in the Amazon,nunless I am wrong.,I don't know of any.,But we have somethingnthat plays the same role,,with much more elegance though:,the trees, our good old friends,that, like geysers,,can transfer an enormous amount of waternfrom the ground into the atmosphere. 
 There are 600 billion treesnin the Amazon forest, 600 billion geysers.,That is done withnan extraordinary sophistication.,They don't need the heat of magma.,They use sunlight to do this process.,So, in a typical sunny day in the Amazon,,a big tree managesnto transfer 1,000 liters of water,through its transpiration --,1,000 liters.,If we take all the Amazon,,which is a very large area,,and add it up to all that waternthat is released by transpiration,,which is the sweat of the forest,,we'll get to an incredible number:,20 billion metric tons of water.,In one day. 
 Do you know how much that is?,The Amazon River,nthe largest river on Earth,,one fifth of all the fresh water,that leaves the continents of thenwhole world and ends up in the oceans,,dumps 17 billion metric tonsnof water a day in the Atlantic Ocean.,This river of vapor,that comes up from the forestnand goes into the atmosphere,is greater than the Amazon River.,Just to give you an idea.,If we could take a gigantic kettle,,the kind you could plug intona power socket, an electric one,,and put those 20 billionnmetric tons of water in it,,how much power would you neednto have this water evaporated?,Any idea? A really big kettle.,A gigantic kettle, right?,50 thousand Itaipus.,Itaipu is still the largestnhydroelectric plant in the world.,and Brazil is very proud of it,because it provides more nthan 30 percent of the power,that is consumed in Brazil.,And the Amazon is here,ndoing this for free.,It's a vivid and extremely powerful plant,nproviding environmental services. 
 Related to this subject,,we are going to talk aboutnwhat I call the paradox of chance,,which is curious.,If you look at the world map --,it's easy to see this --,you'll see that there are forestsnin the equatorial zone,,and deserts are organizednat 30 degrees north latitude,,30 degrees south latitude, aligned.,Look over there, in the southernnhemisphere, the Atacama;,Namibia and Kalahari in Africa;nthe Australian desert.,In the northern hemisphere,nthe Sahara, Sonoran, etc.,There is an exception, and it's curious:,It's the quadrangle that ranges fromnCuiabá to Buenos Aires,,and from São Paulo to the Andes.,This quadranglenwas supposed to be a desert.,It's on the line of deserts.,Why isn't it? That's whynI call it the paradox of chance.,What do we have in South Americanthat is different? 
 If we could use the analogy,of the blood circulating in our bodies,,like the waterncirculating in the landscape,,we see that rivers are veins,,they drain the landscape,nthey drain the tissue of nature.,Where are the arteries?,Any guess?,What takes --,How does water get to irrigatenthe tissues of nature,and bring everything back through rivers?,There is a new type of river,,which originates in the blue sea,,which flows through the green ocean --,it not only flows, but it is alsonpumped by the green ocean --,and then it falls on our land.,All our economy, that quadrangle,,70 percent of South America's nGDP comes from that area.,It depends on this river.,This river flows invisibly above us.,We are floating herenon this floating hotel,,on one of the largest rivers on Earth,nthe Negro River.,It's a bit dry and rough,nbut we are floating here,,and there is thisninvisible river running above us. 
 This river has a pulse.,Here it is, pulsing.,That's why we also talk about the heart.,You can see the different seasons there.,There's the rainy season. In the Amazon,nwe used to have two seasons,,the humid seasonnand the even more humid season.,Now we have a dry season.,You can see the river covering that region,which, otherwise, would be a desert.nAnd it is not. 
 We, scientists --nYou see that I'm struggling here,to move my headnfrom one side to the other.,Scientists study how it works, why, etc.,and these studiesnare generating a series of discoveries,,which are absolutely fabulous,,to raise our awareness of the wealth,,the complexity,nand the wonder that we have,,the symphony we have in this process.,One of them is: How is rain formed?,Above the Amazon, there is clean air,,as there is clean air above the ocean.,The blue sea has clean air above itnand forms pretty few clouds;,there's almost no rain there.,The green ocean has the same clean air,nbut forms a lot of rain.,What is happening here that is different? 
 The forest emits smells,,and these smells are condensation nuclei,,which form drops in the atmosphere.,Then, clouds are formednand there is torrential rain.,The sprinkler of the Garden of Eden.,This relation between a living thing,nwhich is the forest,,and a nonliving thing,nwhich is the atmosphere,,is ingenious in the Amazon,,because the forest providesnwater and seeds,,and the atmosphere forms the rainnand gives water back,,guaranteeing the forest's survival. 
 There are other factors as well.,We've talked a little about the heart,,and let's now talk aboutnanother function: the liver!,When humid air, high humiditynand radiation are combined,with these organic compounds,,which I call exogenous vitamin C,ngenerous vitamin C in the form of gas,,the plants release antioxidants,which react with pollutants.,You can rest assured,that you are breathing the purest airnon Earth, here in the Amazon,,because the plants take carenof this characteristic as well.,This benefits the very way plants work,,which is another ingenious cycle. 
 Speaking of fractals,,and their relation with the way we work,,we can establish other comparisons.,As in the upper airways of our lungs,,the air in the Amazonngets cleaned up from the excess of dust.,The dust in the air that we breathenis cleaned by our airways.,This keeps the excess of dustnfrom affecting the rainfall.,When there are fires in the Amazon,,the smoke stops the rain, nit stops raining,,the forest dries up and catches fire.,There is another fractal analogy.,Like in the veins and arteries,,the rain water is a feedback.,It returns to the atmosphere.,Like endocrinal glands and hormones,,there are those gasesnwhich I told you about before,,that are formed and releasedninto the atmosphere, like hormones,,which help in the formation of rain.,Like the liver and the kidneys,nas I've said, cleaning the air.,And, finally, like the heart:,pumping water from outside, from the sea,,into the forest.,We call it the biotic moisture pump,,a new theory that is explainednin a very simple way. 
 If there is a desert in the continent,with a nearby sea,,evaporation's greater on the sea,,and it sucks the air above the desert.,The desert is trapped in this condition.nIt will always be dry.,If you haventhe opposite situation, a forest,,the evaporation, as we showed,nis much greater, because of the trees,,and this relation is reversed.,The air above the seanis sucked into the continent,and humidity is imported.,This satellite imagenwas taken one month ago —,that's Manaus down there,nwe're down there —,and it shows this process.,It's not a common little rivernthat flows into a canal.,It's a mighty rivernthat irrigates South America,,among other things.,This image shows those paths,,all the hurricanesnthat have been recorded.,You can see that, in the red square,nthere hardly are any hurricanes.,That is no accident.,This pump that sucksnthe moisture into the continent,also speeds up the air above the sea,,and this prevents hurricane formations. 
 To close this part and sum up,,I'd like to talk aboutnsomething a little different.,I have several colleagues,who worked in the developmentnof these theories.,They think, and so do I,,that we can save planet Earth.,I'm not talking only about the Amazon.,The Amazon teaches us a lesson,on how pristine nature works.,We didn't understandnthese processes before,because the rest of the worldnis messed up.,We could understand it here, though.,These colleagues proposenthat, yes, we can,save other areas,,including deserts.,If we could establish forestsnin those other areas,,we can reverse climate change,,including global warming. 
 I have a dear colleague in India,,whose name is Suprabha Seshan,nand she has a motto.,Her motto is,n"Gardening back the biosphere,","Reajardinando a biosfera" in Portuguese.,She does a wonderful jobnrebuilding ecosystems.,We need to do this.,Having closed this quick introduction,,we see the reality that we have out here,,which is drought, this climate change,,things that we already knew. 
 I'd like to tell you a short story.,Once, about four years ago,,I attended a declamation,nof a text by Davi Kopenawa,,a wise representativenof the Yanomami people,,and it went more or less like this:,"Doesn't the white man know,that, if he destroys the forest,nthere will be no more rain?,And that, if there's no more rain,,there'll be nothing to drink, or to eat?",I heard that, and my eyes welled up,and I went, "Oh, my!,I've been studying this for 20 years,nwith a super computer,,dozens, thousands of scientists,,and we are starting to get to thisnconclusion, which he already knows!",A critical point is the Yanomaminhave never deforested.,How could they know the rain would end?,This bugged me and I was befuddled.,How could he know that? 
 Some months later,nI met him at another event and said,,"Davi, how did you know that if the forestnwas destroyed, there'd be no more rain?",He replied:n"The spirit of the forest told us.",For me, this was a game changer,,a radical change.,I said, "Gosh!,Why am I doing all this science,to get to a conclusionnthat he already knows?",Then, something nabsolutely critical hit me,,which is,,seeing is believing.,Out of sight, out of mind.,This is a need the previous speakernpointed out:,We need to see things --,I mean, we, Western society,,which is becoming global, civilized --,we need to see.,If we don't see,nwe don't register the information.,We live in ignorance. 
 So, I propose the following --,of course, the astronomernwouldn't like the idea --,but let's turn the Hubble telescopenupside down.,And let's make it look down here,,rather than to the far reachesnof the universe.,The universe is wonderful,,but we have a practical reality,,which is we live in an unknown cosmos,,and we're ignorant about it.,We're trampling on this wonderful cosmos,that shelters us and houses us.,Talk to any astrophysicist.,The Earth is a statistical improbability.,The stability and comfort that we enjoy,ndespite the droughts of the Negro River,,and all the heat and coldnand typhoons, etc.,,there is nothing like it in the universe,nthat we know of. 
 Then, let's turn Hubble in our direction,,and let's look at the Earth.,Let's start with the Amazon!,Let's dive,,let's reach out the realitynwe live in every day,,and look carefully at it,nsince that's what we need.,Davi Kopenawa doesn't need this.,He has something alreadynthat I think I missed.,I was educated by television.,I think that I missed this,,an ancestral record,,a valuation of what I don't know,nwhat I haven't seen.,He is not a doubting Thomas.,He believes, nwith veneration and reverence,,in what his ancestorsnand the spirits taught him.,We can't do it,nso let's look into the forest.,Even with Hubble up there --,this is a bird's-eye view, right?,Even when this happens,,we also see something that we don't know.,The Spanish called it the green inferno.,If you go out thereninto the bushes and get lost,,and, let's say, if you head west,,it's 900 kilometers to Colombia,,and another 1,000 to somewhere else.,So, you can figure outnwhy they called it the green inferno. 
 But go and look at what is in there.,It is a live carpet.,Each color you see is a tree species.,Each tree, each tree top,,has up to 10,000 species of insects in it,,let alone the millions of speciesnof fungi, bacteria, etc.,All invisible.,All of it is an even stranger cosmos to us,than the galaxies billionsnof light years away from the Earth,,which Hubble bringsnto our newspapers everyday. 
 I'm going to end my talk here --,I have a few seconds left --,by showing you this wonderful being.,When we see the morpho butterflynin the forest,,we feel like someone's left opennthe door to heaven,,and this creature escaped from there,nbecause it's so beautiful.,However, I cannot finish,without showing you a tech side.,We are tech-arrogant.,We deprive nature of its technology.,A robotic hand is technological,,mine is biological,,and we don't think about it anymore. 
 Let's then look at the morpho butterfly,,an example of an invisiblentechnological competence of life,,which is at the very heart of ournpossibility of surviving on this planet,,and let's zoom in on it.nAgain, Hubble is there.,Let's get into the butterfly's wings.,Scholars have tried to explain:nWhy is it blue?,Let's zoom in on it.,What you see is that the architecturenof the invisible humiliates,the best architects in the world.,All of this on a tiny scale.,Besides its beauty and functioning,nthere is another side to it.,In nature,,all that is organized in extraordinarynstructures has a function.,This function of the morpho butterfly —nit is not blue;,it does not have blue pigments.,It has photonic crystals on its surface,naccording to people who studied it,,which are extremely nsophisticated crystals.,Our technology hadnnothing like that at the time.,Hitachi has now made a monitor,that uses this technology,,and it is used in optical fibersnto transmit --,Janine Benyus, who's been here severalntimes, talks about it: biomimetics.,My time's up. 
 Then, I'll wrap it up withnwhat is at the base of this capacity,,of this competence of biodiversity,,producing all these wonderful services:,the living cell.,It is a structure with a few microns,nwhich is an internal wonder.,There are TED Talks about it.nI won't talk much longer,,but each person in this room,nincluding myself,,has 100 trillion of thesenmicromachines in their body,,so that we can enjoy well-being.,Imagine what is out therenin the Amazon forest:,100 trillion. This is greaternthan the number of stars in the sky.,And we are not aware of it. 
 Thank you so much. (Applause)I'd like to start with a couple of quick examples.,These are spinneret glands,on the abdomen of a spider.,They produce six different types of silk, which is spun together into a fiber,,tougher than any fiber humans have ever made.,The nearest we've come is with aramid fiber.,And to make that, it involves extremes of temperature,,extremes of pressure and loads of pollution.,And yet the spider manages to do it at ambient temperature and pressure,with raw materials of dead flies and water.,It does suggest we've still got a bit to learn.,This beetle can detect a forest fire at 80 kilometers away.,That's roughly 10,000 times the range,of man-made fire detectors.,And what's more, this guy doesn't need a wire,connected all the way back to a power station burning fossil fuels. 
 So these two examples give a sense of what biomimicry can deliver.,If we could learn to make things and do things the way nature does,,we could achieve factor 10, factor 100,,maybe even factor 1,000 savings,in resource and energy use.,And if we're to make progress with the sustainability revolution,,I believe there are three really big changes,we need to bring about.,Firstly, radical increases in resource efficiency.,Secondly, shifting from a linear, wasteful,,polluting way of using resources,to a closed-loop model.,And thirdly, changing from a fossil fuel economy,to a solar economy.,And for all three of these, I believe,,biomimicry has a lot of the solutions that we're going to need. 
 You could look at nature as being like a catalog of products,,and all of those have benefited,from a 3.8-billion-year research and development period.,And given that level of investment, it makes sense to use it.,So I'm going to talk about some projects that have explored these ideas.,And let's start with radical increases,in resource efficiency.,When we were working on the Eden Project,,we had to create a very large greenhouse,in a site that was not only irregular,,but it was continually changing because it was still being quarried.,It was a hell of a challenge,,and it was actually examples from biology,that provided a lot of the clues.,So for instance,,it was soap bubbles that helped us generate a building form,that would work regardless of the final ground levels.,Studying pollen grains,and radiolaria and carbon molecules,helped us devise the most efficient structural solution,using hexagons and pentagons. 
 The next move was that we wanted,to try and maximize the size of those hexagons.,And to do that we had to find an alternative to glass,,which is really very limited in terms of its unit sizes.,And in nature there are lots of examples,of very efficient structures based on pressurized membranes.,So we started exploring this material called ETFE.,It's a high-strength polymer.,And what you do is you put it together in three layers,,you weld it around the edge, and then you inflate it.,And the great thing about this stuff,is you can make it in units,of roughly seven times the size of glass,,and it was only one percent of the weight of double-glazing.,So that was a factor-100 saving.,And what we found is that we got into a positive cycle,in which one breakthrough facilitated another.,So with such large, lightweight pillows,,we had much less steel.,With less steel we were getting more sunlight in,,which meant we didn't have to put as much extra heat in winter.,And with less overall weight in the superstructure,,there were big savings in the foundations.,And at the end of the project we worked out,that the weight of that superstructure,was actually less than the weight of the air inside the building. 
 So I think the Eden Project is a fairly good example,of how ideas from biology,can lead to radical increases in resource efficiency --,delivering the same function,,but with a fraction of the resource input.,And actually there are loads of examples in nature,that you could turn to for similar solutions.,So for instance, you could develop super-efficient roof structures,based on giant Amazon water lilies,,whole buildings inspired by abalone shells,,super-lightweight bridges inspired by plant cells.,There's a world of beauty and efficiency to explore here,using nature as a design tool. 
 So now I want to go onto talking about the linear-to-closed-loop idea.,The way we tend to use resources,is we extract them,,we turn them into short-life products and then dispose of them.,Nature works very differently.,In ecosystems, the waste from one organism,becomes the nutrient for something else in that system.,And there are some examples of projects,that have deliberately tried to mimic ecosystems.,And one of my favorites,is called the Cardboard to Caviar Project,by Graham Wiles.,And in their area they had a lot of shops and restaurants,that were producing lots of food, cardboard and plastic waste.,It was ending up in landfills.,Now the really clever bit is what they did with the cardboard waste.,And I'm just going to talk through this animation. 
 So they were paid to collect it from the restaurants.,They then shredded the cardboard,and sold it to equestrian centers as horse bedding.,When that was soiled, they were paid again to collect it.,They put it into worm recomposting systems,,which produced a lot of worms, which they fed to Siberian sturgeon,,which produced caviar, which they sold back to the restaurants.,So it transformed a linear process,into a closed-loop model,,and it created more value in the process.,Graham Wiles has continued to add more and more elements to this,,turning waste streams into schemes that create value.,And just as natural systems,tend to increase in diversity and resilience over time,,there's a real sense with this project,that the number of possibilities,just continue increasing.,And I know it's a quirky example,,but I think the implications of this are quite radical,,because it suggests that we could actually,transform a big problem -- waste -- into a massive opportunity. 
 And particularly in cities --,we could look at the whole metabolism of cities,,and look at those as opportunities.,And that's what we're doing on the next project I'm going to talk about,,the Mobius Project,,where we're trying to bring together a number of activities,,all within one building,,so that the waste from one can be the nutrient for another.,And the kind of elements I'm talking about,are, firstly, we have a restaurant inside a productive greenhouse,,a bit like this one in Amsterdam called De Kas.,Then we would have an anaerobic digester,,which could deal with all the biodegradable waste from the local area,,turn that into heat for the greenhouse,and electricity to feed back into the grid.,We'd have a water treatment system,treating wastewater, turning that into fresh water,and generating energy from the solids,using just plants and micro-organisms.,We'd have a fish farm fed with vegetable waste from the kitchen,and worms from the compost,and supplying fish back to the restaurant.,And we'd also have a coffee shop, and the waste grains from that,could be used as a substrate for growing mushrooms. 
 So you can see that we're bringing together,cycles of food, energy and water and waste,all within one building.,And just for fun, we've proposed this for a roundabout in central London,,which at the moment is a complete eyesore.,Some of you may recognize this.,And with just a little bit of planning,,we could transform a space dominated by traffic,into one that provides open space for people,,reconnects people with food,and transforms waste into closed loop opportunities. 
 So the final project I want to talk about,is the Sahara Forest Project, which we're working on at the moment.,It may come as a surprise to some of you,to hear that quite large areas of what are currently desert,were actually forested a fairly short time ago.,So for instance, when Julius Caesar arrived in North Africa,,huge areas of North Africa,were covered in cedar and cypress forests.,And during the evolution of life on the Earth,,it was the colonization,of the land by plants,that helped create the benign climate we currently enjoy.,The converse is also true.,The more vegetation we lose,,the more that's likely to exacerbate climate change,and lead to further desertification.,And this animation,,this shows photosynthetic activity over the course of a number of years,,and what you can see is that the boundaries of those deserts,shift quite a lot,,and that raises the question,of whether we can intervene at the boundary conditions,to halt, or maybe even reverse, desertification. 
 And if you look at some of the organisms,that have evolved to live in deserts,,there are some amazing examples of adaptations to water scarcity.,This is the Namibian fog-basking beetle,,and it's evolved a way of harvesting its own fresh water in a desert.,The way it does this is it comes out at night,,crawls to the top of a sand dune,,and because it's got a matte black shell,,is able to radiate heat out to the night sky,and become slightly cooler than its surroundings.,So when the moist breeze blows in off the sea,,you get these droplets of water forming on the beetle's shell.,Just before sunrise, he tips his shell up, the water runs down into his mouth,,has a good drink, goes off and hides for the rest of the day.,And the ingenuity, if you could call it that,,goes even further.,Because if you look closely at the beetle's shell,,there are lots of little bumps on that shell.,And those bumps are hydrophilic; they attract water.,Between them there's a waxy finish which repels water.,And the effect of this is that,as the droplets start to form on the bumps,,they stay in tight, spherical beads,,which means they're much more mobile,than they would be if it was just a film of water over the whole beetle's shell.,So even when there's only a small amount of moisture in the air,,it's able to harvest that very effectively and channel it down to its mouth.,So amazing example of an adaptation,to a very resource-constrained environment --,and in that sense, very relevant,to the kind of challenges we're going to be facing,over the next few years, next few decades. 
 We're working with the guy who invented the Seawater Greenhouse.,This is a greenhouse designed for arid coastal regions,,and the way it works is that you have this whole wall of evaporator grills,,and you trickle seawater over that,so that wind blows through, it picks up a lot of moisture,and is cooled in the process.,So inside it's cool and humid,,which means the plants need less water to grow.,And then at the back of the greenhouse,,it condenses a lot of that humidity as freshwater,in a process that is effectively identical to the beetle.,And what they found with the first Seawater Greenhouse that was built,was it was producing slightly more freshwater,than it needed for the plants inside.,So they just started spreading this on the land around,,and the combination of that and the elevated humidity,had quite a dramatic effect on the local area.,This photograph was taken on completion day,,and just one year later, it looked like that.,So it was like a green inkblot spreading out from the building,turning barren land back into biologically productive land --,and in that sense, going beyond sustainable design,to achieve restorative design. 
 So we were keen to scale this up,and apply biomimicry ideas to maximize the benefits.,And when you think about nature,,often you think about it as being all about competition.,But actually in mature ecosystems,,you're just as likely to find examples,of symbiotic relationships.,So an important biomimicry principle,is to find ways of bringing technologies together,in symbiotic clusters.,And the technology that we settled on,as an ideal partner for the Seawater Greenhouse,is concentrated solar power,,which uses solar-tracking mirrors to focus the sun's heat,to create electricity.,And just to give you some sense of the potential of CSP,,consider that we receive,10,000 times as much energy from the sun every year,as we use in energy from all forms --,10,000 times.,So our energy problems are not intractable.,It's a challenge to our ingenuity.,And the kind of synergies I'm talking about,are, firstly, both these technologies work very well in hot, sunny deserts.,CSP needs a supply of demineralized freshwater.,That's exactly what the Seawater Greenhouse produces.,CSP produces a lot of waste heat.,We'll be able to make use of all that to evaporate more seawater,and enhance the restorative benefits.,And finally, in the shade under the mirrors,,it's possible to grow all sorts of crops,that would not grow in direct sunlight.,So this is how this scheme would look.,The idea is we create this long hedge of greenhouses facing the wind.,We'd have concentrated solar power plants,at intervals along the way. 
 Some of you might be wondering what we would do with all the salts.,And with biomimicry, if you've got an underutilized resource,,you don't think, "How am I going to dispose of this?",You think, "What can I add to the system to create more value?",And it turns out,that different things crystallize out at different stages.,When you evaporate seawater, the first thing to crystallize out,is calcium carbonate.,And that builds up on the evaporators --,and that's what that image on the left is --,gradually getting encrusted with the calcium carbonate.,So after a while, we could take that out,,use it as a lightweight building block.,And if you think about the carbon in that,,that would have come out of the atmosphere, into the sea,and then locked away in a building product. 
 The next thing is sodium chloride.,You can also compress that into a building block,,as they did here.,This is a hotel in Bolivia.,And then after that, there are all sorts,of compounds and elements that we can extract,,like phosphates, that we need to get back into the desert soils to fertilize them.,And there's just about every element of the periodic table,in seawater.,So it should be possible to extract valuable elements,like lithium for high-performance batteries.,And in parts of the Arabian Gulf,,the seawater, the salinity is increasing steadily,due to the discharge of waste brine,from desalination plants.,And it's pushing the ecosystem close to collapse.,Now we would be able to make use of all that waste brine.,We could evaporate it,to enhance the restorative benefits,and capture the salts,,transforming an urgent waste problem into a big opportunity.,Really the Sahara Forest Project is a model,for how we could create zero-carbon food,,abundant renewable energy in some of the most water-stressed parts of the planet,as well as reversing desertification in certain areas. 
 So returning to those big challenges that I mentioned at the beginning:,radical increases in resource efficiency,,closing loops and a solar economy.,They're not just possible; they're critical.,And I firmly believe that studying the way nature solves problems,will provide a lot of the solutions.,But perhaps more than anything, what this thinking provides,is a really positive way of talking about sustainable design.,Far too much of the talk about the environment,uses very negative language.,But here it's about synergies and abundance and optimizing.,And this is an important point. 
 Antoine de Saint-Exupery once said,,"If you want to build a flotilla of ships,,you don't sit around talking about carpentry.,No, you need to set people's souls ablaze,with visions of exploring distant shores.",And that's what we need to do, so let's be positive,,and let's make progress with what could be,the most exciting period of innovation we've ever seen. 
 Thank you.

 Pep Rosenfeld: Folks,nyou've just met Claron McFadden.,She is a world-class soprano singer,who studied in Rochester, New York.,Her celebrated operatic rolesnare numerous and varied.,In August 2007, Claron was awardednthe Amsterdam Prize for the Arts,,winning praise for her brilliance,,her amazing and extensivelynwide repertoire,and her vivid stage personality.,Please welcome Claron McFadden. 
 (Applause) 
 Claron McFadden: The human voice:,mysterious, spontaneous, primal.,For me, the human voice is the vesselnon which all emotions travel --,except, perhaps, jealousy.,And the breath,,the breath is the captain of that vessel.,A child is born,,takes its first breath -- 
 (Inhales) 
 Whah!,And we behold the wondrous beauty,of vocal expression --,mysterious, spontaneous,and primal. 
 A few years ago, I didna meditation retreat in Thailand.,I wanted a place,where I would have total silencenand total solitude.,I spent two weeks at this retreat,in my own little hut --,no music, no nothing -- sounds of nature,,trying to find the essencenof concentration,,being in the moment. 
 On my last day,,the woman who looked after the place,,she came and we spoke for a minute,,and then she said to me,,"Would you sing something for me?",And I thought, but this is a placenof total quiet and silence.,I can't make noise.,She said, "Please, sing for me.",So I closed my eyes,,I took breath,and the first thing that came up and out,was "Summertime,",Porgy and Bess. 
 (Singing) Summertimenand the livin' is easy.,Fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high.,Oh, your daddy's richnand your ma is good-lookin'.,So hush little baby,,don't you cry. 
 And I opened my eyes,,and I saw that she had her eyes closed.,And after a moment, she opened her eyes,and she looked at me and she said,,"It's like meditation." 
 And in that moment I understood,that everything I had gonento Thailand to look for,,to search for,,I had it already in my singing --,the calm, but alertness,,the focus, but awareness,,and being totally in the moment.,When you're totally in the moment --,when I'm totally in the moment,,the vessel of expression is open.,The emotions can flow from me,to you,and back.,It's an extremely profound experience. 
 There's a piece by a composer,,an American composer called John Cage.,It's called "Aria.",It was written for an amazing singerncalled Cathy Berberian.,And the thing about this piecenthat's so special --,if you see it behind me --,it's not notated in any way.,No notes, no flats, no sharps.,But it's a kind of structure.,And the singer, within this structure,,has total freedomnto be creative, spontaneous. 
 For example,,there are different colors,and each color getsna different type of singing --,pop, country and western, opera, jazz --,and you just havento be consistent with that color.,You see there are different lines.,You choose in your own temponin your own way,to follow the line,,but you must respect it,,more or less.,And these little dots,,these represent a sort of sound,that's not a vocal, not a lyrical way,of expressing the voice.,Using the body -- it could be sneezing,,it could be coughing, animals --

 (Applause)Today I want to talk about design,,but not design as we usually think about it.,I want to talk about what is happening now,in our scientific, biotechnological culture,,where, for really the first time in history,,we have the power to design bodies,,to design animal bodies,,to design human bodies.,In the history of our planet,,there have been three great waves of evolution. 
 The first wave of evolution,is what we think of as Darwinian evolution.,So, as you all know,,species lived in particular ecological niches,and particular environments,,and the pressures of those environments,selected which changes,,through random mutation in species,,were going to be preserved.,Then human beings stepped out,of the Darwinian flow of evolutionary history,and created the second great wave of evolution,,which was we changed the environment,in which we evolved.,We altered our ecological niche,by creating civilization.,And that has been the second great --,couple 100,000 years, 150,000 years --,flow of our evolution.,By changing our environment,,we put new pressures,on our bodies to evolve.,Whether it was through settling down in agricultural communities,,all the way through modern medicine,,we have changed our own evolution.,Now we're entering a third great wave,of evolutionary history,,which has been called many things:,"intentional evolution,","evolution by design" --,very different than intelligent design --,whereby we are actually now,intentionally designing and altering,the physiological forms that inhabit our planet. 
 So I want to take you through a kind of whirlwind tour of that,and then at the end talk a little bit,about what some of the implications are for us,and for our species, as well as our cultures,,because of this change.,Now we actually have been doing it for a long time.,We started selectively breeding animals,many, many thousands of years ago.,And if you think of dogs for example,,dogs are now intentionally-designed creatures.,There isn't a dog on this earth that's a natural creature.,Dogs are the result,of selectively breeding traits that we like.,But we had to do it the hard way in the old days,by choosing offspring that looked a particular way,and then breeding them.,We don't have to do it that way anymore. 
 This is a beefalo.,A beefalo is a buffalo-cattle hybrid.,And they are now making them,,and someday, perhaps pretty soon,,you will have beefalo patties,in your local supermarket.,This is a geep,,a goat-sheep hybrid.,The scientists that made this cute little creature,ended up slaughtering it and eating it afterwards.,I think they said it tasted like chicken.,This is a cama.,A cama is a camel-llama hybrid,,created to try to get the hardiness of a camel,with some of the personality traits,of a llama.,And they are now using these in certain cultures.,Then there's the liger.,This is the largest cat in the world --,the lion-tiger hybrid.,It's bigger than a tiger.,And in the case of the liger,,there actually have been one or two that have been seen in the wild.,But these were created by scientists,using both selective breeding and genetic technology.,And then finally, everybody's favorite,,the zorse.,None of this is Photoshopped. These are real creatures.,And so one of the things we've been doing,is using genetic enhancement,,or genetic manipulation,,of normal selective breeding,pushed a little bit through genetics.,And if that were all this was about,,then it would be an interesting thing.,But something much, much more powerful,is happening now. 
 These are normal mammalian cells,genetically engineered with a bioluminescent gene,taken out of deep-sea jellyfish.,We all know that some deep-sea creatures glow.,Well, they've now taken that gene, that bioluminescent gene,,and put it into mammal cells.,These are normal cells.,And what you see here,is these cells glowing in the dark,under certain wavelengths of light.,Once they could do that with cells, they could do it with organisms.,So they did it with mouse pups,,kittens.,And by the way, the reason the kittens here are orange and these are green,is because that's a bioluminescent gene from coral,,while this is from jellyfish.,They did it with pigs.,They did it with puppies.,And, in fact,,they did it with monkeys.,And if you can do it with monkeys --,though the great leap in trying to genetically manipulate,is actually between monkeys and apes --,if they can do it in monkeys,,they can probably figure out how to do it in apes,,which means they can do it in human beings.,In other words, it is theoretically possible,that before too long we will be biotechnologically capable,of creating human beings,that glow in the dark.,Be easier to find us at night. 
 And in fact, right now in many states,,you can go out and you can buy bioluminescent pets.,These are zebra fish. They're normally black and silver.,These are zebra fish that have been genetically engineered,to be yellow, green, red,,and they are actually available now in certain states.,Other states have banned them.,Nobody knows what to do with these kinds of creatures.,There is no area of the government -- not the EPA or the FDA --,that controls genetically-engineered pets.,And so some states have decided to allow them,,some states have decided to ban them. 
 Some of you may have read,about the FDA's consideration right now,of genetically-engineered salmon.,The salmon on top,is a genetically engineered Chinook salmon,,using a gene from these salmon,and from one other fish that we eat,,to make it grow much faster,using a lot less feed.,And right now the FDA is trying to make a final decision,on whether, pretty soon, you could be eating this fish --,it'll be sold in the stores.,And before you get too worried about it,,here in the United States,,the majority of food you buy in the supermarket,already has genetically-modified components to it.,So even as we worry about it,,we have allowed it to go on in this country -- much different in Europe --,without any regulation,,and even without any identification on the package. 
 These are all the first cloned animals,of their type.,So in the lower right here,,you have Dolly, the first cloned sheep --,now happily stuffed in a museum in Edinburgh;,Ralph the rat, the first cloned rat;,CC the cat, for cloned cat;,Snuppy, the first cloned dog --,Snuppy for Seoul National University puppy --,created in South Korea,by the very same man that some of you may remember,had to end up resigning in disgrace,because he claimed he had cloned a human embryo, which he had not.,He actually was the first person,to clone a dog, which is a very difficult thing to do,,because dog genomes are very plastic.,This is Prometea, the first cloned horse.,It's a Haflinger horse cloned in Italy,,a real "gold ring" of cloning,,because there are many horses that win important races,who are geldings.,In other words, the equipment to put them out to stud,has been removed.,But if you can clone that horse,,you can have both the advantage of having a gelding run in the race,and his identical genetic duplicate,can then be put out to stud.,These were the first cloned calves,,the first cloned grey wolves,,and then, finally,,the first cloned piglets:,Alexis, Chista, Carrel, Janie and Dotcom. 
 (Laughter) 
 In addition, we've started to use cloning technology,to try to save endangered species.,This is the use of animals now,to create drugs and other things in their bodies,that we want to create.,So with antithrombin in that goat --,that goat has been genetically modified,so that the molecules of its milk,actually include the molecule of antithrombin,that GTC Genetics wants to create.,And then in addition, transgenic pigs, knockout pigs,,from the National Institute of Animal Science in South Korea,,are pigs that they are going to use, in fact,,to try to create all kinds of drugs,and other industrial types of chemicals,that they want the blood and the milk,of these animals,to produce for them,,instead of producing them in an industrial way. 
 These are two creatures,that were created,in order to save endangered species.,The guar,is an endangered Southeast Asian ungulate.,A somatic cell, a body cell,,was taken from its body,,gestated in the ovum of a cow,,and then that cow gave birth to a guar.,Same thing happened with the mouflon,,where it's an endangered species of sheep.,It was gestated in a regular sheep body,,which actually raises an interesting biological problem.,We have two kinds of DNA in our bodies.,We have our nucleic DNA,that everybody thinks of as our DNA,,but we also have DNA in our mitochondria,,which are the energy packets of the cell.,That DNA is passed down through our mothers.,So really, what you end up having here,is not a guar and not a mouflon,,but a guar,with cow mitochondria,,and therefore cow mitochondrial DNA,,and a mouflon with another species of sheep's,mitochondrial DNA.,These are really hybrids, not pure animals.,And it raises the question of how we're going to define animal species,in the age of biotechnology --,a question that we're not really sure yet,how to solve. 
 This lovely creature,is an Asian cockroach.,And what they've done here,is they've put electrodes in its ganglia and its brain,and then a transmitter on top,,and it's on a big computer tracking ball.,And now, using a joystick,,they can send this creature,around the lab,and control whether it goes left or right,,forwards or backwards.,They've created a kind of insect bot,,or bugbot.,It gets worse than that -- or perhaps better than that.,This actually is one of DARPA's very important --,DARPA is the Defense Research Agency --,one of their projects.,These goliath beetles,are wired in their wings.,They have a computer chip strapped to their backs,,and they can fly these creatures around the lab.,They can make them go left, right. They can make them take off.,They can't actually make them land.,They put them about one inch above the ground,,and then they shut everything off and they go pfft.,But it's the closest they can get to a landing. 
 And in fact, this technology has gotten so developed,that this creature --,this is a moth --,this is the moth in its pupa stage,,and that's when they put the wires in,and they put in the computer technology,,so that when the moth actually emerges as a moth,,it is already prewired.,The wires are already in its body,,and they can just hook it up to their technology,,and now they've got these bugbots,that they can send out for surveillance.,They can put little cameras on them,and perhaps someday deliver,other kinds of ordinance,to warzones. 
 It's not just insects.,This is the ratbot, or the robo-rat,by Sanjiv Talwar at SUNY Downstate.,Again, it's got technology --,it's got electrodes going into its left and right hemispheres;,it's got a camera on top of its head.,The scientists can make this creature,go left, right.,They have it running through mazes, controlling where it's going.,They've now created an organic robot.,The graduate students,in Sanjiv Talwar's lab,said, "Is this ethical?,We've taken away the autonomy of this animal.",I'll get back to that in a minute. 
 There's also been work done with monkeys.,This is Miguel Nicolelis of Duke.,He took owl monkeys,,wired them up,so that a computer watched their brains while they moved,,especially looking at the movement of their right arm.,The computer learned what the monkey brain did,to move its arm in various ways.,They then hooked it up to a prosthetic arm,,which you see here in the picture,,put the arm in another room.,Pretty soon, the computer learned, by reading the monkey's brainwaves,,to make that arm in the other room,do whatever the monkey's arm did.,Then he put a video monitor,in the monkey's cage,that showed the monkey this prosthetic arm,,and the monkey got fascinated.,The monkey recognized that whatever she did with her arm,,this prosthetic arm would do.,And eventually she was moving it and moving it,,and eventually stopped moving her right arm,and, staring at the screen,,could move the prosthetic arm in the other room,only with her brainwaves --,which means that monkey,became the first primate in the history of the world,to have three independent functional arms. 
 And it's not just technology,that we're putting into animals.,This is Thomas DeMarse at the University of Florida.,He took 20,000 and then 60,000,disaggregated rat neurons --,so these are just individual neurons from rats --,put them on a chip.,They self-aggregated into a network,,became an integrated chip.,And he used that,as the IT piece,of a mechanism which ran a flight simulator.,So now we have organic computer chips,made out of living, self-aggregating neurons.,Finally, Mussa-Ivaldi of Northwestern,took a completely intact,,independent lamprey eel brain.,This is a brain from a lamprey eel.,It is living --,fully-intact brain in a nutrient medium,with these electrodes going off to the sides,,attached photosensitive sensors to the brain,,put it into a cart --,here's the cart, the brain is sitting there in the middle --,and using this brain as the sole processor for this cart,,when you turn on a light and shine it at the cart,,the cart moves toward the light;,when you turn it off, it moves away.,It's photophilic.,So now we have a complete,living lamprey eel brain.,Is it thinking lamprey eel thoughts,,sitting there in its nutrient medium?,I don't know,,but in fact it is a fully living brain,that we have managed to keep alive,to do our bidding. 
 So, we are now at the stage,where we are creating creatures,for our own purposes.,This is a mouse created by Charles Vacanti,of the University of Massachusetts.,He altered this mouse,so that it was genetically engineered,to have skin that was less immunoreactive to human skin,,put a polymer scaffolding of an ear under it,and created an ear that could then be taken off the mouse,and transplanted onto a human being.,Genetic engineering,coupled with polymer physiotechnology,coupled with xenotransplantation.,This is where we are in this process. 
 Finally, not that long ago,,Craig Venter created the first artificial cell,,where he took a cell, took a DNA synthesizer,,which is a machine,,created an artificial genome,,put it in a different cell --,the genome was not of the cell he put it in --,and that cell then reproduced,as the other cell.,In other words,,that was the first creature in the history of the world,that had a computer as its parent --,it did not have an organic parent.,And so, asks The Economist:,"The first artificial organism and its consequences." 
 So you may have thought,that the creation of life,was going to happen in something that looked like that.,(Laughter),But in fact, that's not what Frankenstein's lab looks like.,This is what Frankenstein's lab looks like.,This is a DNA synthesizer,,and here at the bottom,are just bottles of A, T, C and G --,the four chemicals,that make up our DNA chain. 
 And so, we need to ask ourselves some questions.,For the first time in the history of this planet,,we are able to directly design organisms.,We can manipulate the plasmas of life,with unprecedented power,,and it confers on us a responsibility.,Is everything okay?,Is it okay to manipulate and create,whatever creatures we want?,Do we have free reign,to design animals?,Do we get to go someday to Pets 'R' Us,and say, "Look, I want a dog.,I'd like it to have the head of a Dachshund,,the body of a retriever,,maybe some pink fur,,and let's make it glow in the dark"?,Does industry get to create creatures,who, in their milk, in their blood, and in their saliva,and other bodily fluids,,create the drugs and industrial molecules we want,and then warehouse them,as organic manufacturing machines?,Do we get to create organic robots,,where we remove the autonomy from these animals,and turn them just into our playthings? 
 And then the final step of this,,once we perfect these technologies in animals,and we start using them in human beings,,what are the ethical guidelines,that we will use then?,It's already happening. It's not science fiction.,We are not only already using these things in animals,,some of them we're already beginning to use,on our own bodies. 
 We are now taking control of our own evolution.,We are directly designing,the future of the species of this planet.,It confers upon us an enormous responsibility,that is not just the responsibility,of the scientists and the ethicists,who are thinking about it and writing about it now.,It is the responsibility of everybody,because it will determine what kind of planet and what kind of bodies,we will have in the future. 
 Thanks. 
 (Applause)If we look around us,,much of what surrounds us,started life as various rocks and sludge,buried in the ground in various places in the world.,But, of course, they don't look like rocks and sludge now.,They look like TV cameras, monitors,,annoying radio mics.,And so this magical transformation,is what I was trying to get at with my project,,which became known as the Toaster Project.,And it was also inspired by this quote,from Douglas Adams,,and the situation is from "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.",And the situation it describes,is the hero of the book -- he's a 20th-century man --,finds himself alone on a strange planet,populated only by a technologically primitive people.,And he kind of assumes that, yes,,he'll become -- these villagers --,he'll become their emperor,and transform their society,with his wonderful command of technology,and science and the elements,,but, of course, realizes,that without the rest of human society,,he can barely make a sandwich,,let alone a toaster.,But he didn't have Wikipedia. 
 So I thought, okay,,I'll try and make an electric toaster from scratch.,And, working on the idea,that the cheapest electric toaster,would also be the simplest to reverse-engineer,,I went and bought the cheapest toaster I could find,,took it home,and was kind of dismayed to discover,that, inside this object,,which I'd bought for just 3.49 pounds,,there were 400 different bits,made out of a hundred-plus different materials.,I didn't have the rest of my life to do this project.,I had maybe nine months.,So I thought, okay, I'll start with five.,And these were steel, mica,,plastic, copper and nickel. 
 So, starting with steel: how do you make steel?,I went and knocked on the door,of the Rio Tinto Chair,of Advanced Mineral Extraction at the Royal School of Mines,and said, "How do you make steel?",And Professor Cilliers was very kind,and talked me through it.,And my vague rememberings from GCSE science --,well, steel comes from iron,,so I phoned up an iron mine.,And said, "Hi, I'm trying to make a toaster.,Can I come up and get some iron?",Unfortunately, when I got there -- emerges Ray.,He had misheard me,and thought I was coming up because I was trying to make a poster,,and so wasn't prepared to take me into the mines.,But after some nagging, I got him to do that. 
 (Video) Ray: It was Crease Limestone,,and that was produced,by sea creatures,350 million years ago,in a nice, warm,,sunny atmosphere.,When you study geology,,you can see what's happened in the past,,and there were terrific changes in the earth. 
 Thomas Thwaites: As you can see, they had the Christmas decorations up.,And of course, it wasn't actually a working mine anymore,,because, though Ray was a miner there,,the mine had closed,and had been reopened as a kind of tourist attraction,,because, of course, it can't compete,on the scale of operations which are happening,in South America, Australia, wherever.,But anyway, I got my suitcase of iron ore,and dragged it back to London on the train,,and then was faced with the problem:,Okay, how do you make this rock,into components for a toaster? 
 So I went back to Professor Cilliers,,and he said, "Go to the library.",So I did,and was looking through the undergraduate textbooks on metallurgy --,completely useless for what I was trying to do.,Because, of course, they don't actually tell you how to do it,if you want to do it yourself and you don't have a smelting plant.,So I ended up going to the History of Science Library,and looking at this book.,This is the first textbook on metallurgy,written in the West, at least.,And there you can see that woodcut,is basically what I ended up doing.,But instead of a bellows, I had a leaf blower.,(Laughter),And that was something that reoccurred throughout the project,,was, the smaller the scale you want to work on,,the further back in time you have to go.,And so this is after,a day and about half a night,smelting this iron.,I dragged out this stuff,,and it wasn't iron.,But luckily,,I found a patent online,for industrial furnaces that use microwaves,,and at 30 minutes at full power,,and I was able to finish off the process. 
 So, my next --,(Applause),The next thing I was trying to get was copper.,Again, this mine,was once the largest copper mine in the world.,It's not anymore,,but I found a retired geology professor,to take me down,,and he said, "Okay, I'll let you have some water from the mine.",And the reason I was interested in getting water,is because water which goes through mines,becomes kind of acidic,and will start picking up,,dissolving the minerals from the mine.,And a good example of this is the Rio Tinto,,which is in Portugal.,As you can see, it's got lots and lots of minerals dissolved in it.,So many such,that it's now just a home for bacteria,who really like acidic, toxic conditions.,But anyway, the water I dragged back,from the Isle of Anglesey where the mine was --,there was enough copper in it,such that I could cast the pins,of my metal electric plug. 
 So my next thing: I was off to Scotland,to get mica.,And mica is a mineral,which is a very good insulator,and very good at insulating electricity.,That's me getting mica.,And the last material I'm going to talk about today is plastic,,and, of course,,my toaster had to have a plastic case.,Plastic is the defining feature,of cheap electrical goods.,And so plastic comes from oil, so I phoned up BP,and spent a good half an hour,trying to convince the PR office at BP,that it would be fantastic for them,if they flew me to an oil rig,and let me have a jug of oil.,BP obviously has a bit more on their mind now.,But even then,they weren't convinced,and said, "Okay, we'll phone you back" -- never did.,So I looked at other ways of making plastic.,And you can actually make plastic,from obviously oils which come from plants, but also from starches.,So this is attempting to make,potato starch plastic.,And for a while that was looking really good.,I poured it into the mold, which you can see there,,which I've made from a tree trunk.,And it was looking good for a while,,but I left it outside, because you had to leave it outside to dry,,and unfortunately I came back,and there were snails eating the unhydrolyzed bits of potato. 
 So kind of out of desperation,,I decided that I could think laterally.,And geologists have actually christened --,well, they're debating whether to christen --,the age that we're living in --,they're debating whether to make it a new geological epoch,called the Anthropocene, the age of Man.,And that's because geologists of the future,would kind of see a sharp shift,in the strata of rock that is being laid down now.,So suddenly, it will become kind of radioactive from Chernobyl,and the 2,000 or so nuclear bombs,that have been set off since 1945.,And there'd also be an extinction event --,like fossils would suddenly disappear.,And also, I thought,that there would be,synthetic polymers,,plastics, embedded in the rock. 
 So I looked up a plastic --,so I decided that I could mine,some of this modern-day rock.,And I went up to Manchester,to visit a place called Axion Recycling.,And they're at the sharp end of what's called the WEEE,,which is this European electrical and electronic waste directive.,And that was brought into force,to try and deal with the mountain of stuff,that is just being made,and then living for a while in our homes,and then going to landfill.,But this is it. 
 (Music) 
 (Laughter) 
 So there's a picture,of my toaster.,(Applause),That's it without the case on.,And there it is on the shelves.,Thanks. 
 (Applause) 
 Bruno Giussani: I'm told you did plug it in once. 
 TT: Yeah, I did plug it in.,I don't know if you could see,,but I was never able to make insulation for the wires.,Kew Gardens were insistent,that I couldn't come and hack into their rubber tree.,So the wires were uninsulated.,So there was 240 volts,going through these homemade copper wires,,homemade plug.,And for about five seconds,,the toaster toasted,,but then, unfortunately,,the element kind of melted itself.,But I considered it a partial success, to be honest. 
 BG: Thomas Thwaites. TT: Thanks.I am honored to be here,,and I'm honored to talk about this topic,,which I think is of grave importance.,We've been talking a lot,about the horrific impacts of plasticnon the planet and on other species,,but plastic hurts people, too --,especially poor people.,And both in the production of plastic,,the use of plasticnand the disposal of plastic,,the people who haventhe bull's-eye on their foreheads,are poor people.,People got very upset,when the BP oil spill happened,,for very good reason.,People thought, "Oh, my God.,This is terrible, this oil --nit's in the water.,It's going to destroynthe living systems there.,People are going to be hurt.,This is a terrible thing,,this oil is going to hurtnthe people in the Gulf." 
 What people don't think about is:,What if the oil had made itnsafely to shore?,What if the oil actually gotnwhere it was trying to go?,Not only would it have been burnednin engines and added to global warming,,but there's a place called "Cancer Alley,",and the reason it's called "Cancer Alley",is because the petrochemical industry,takes that oil and turns it into plastic,and in the process, kills people.,It shortens the lives of the peoplenwho live there in the Gulf.,So oil and petrochemicals are notnjust a problem when there's a spill;,they're a problem when there's not.,And what we don't often appreciate,is the price that poor people pay,for us to have these disposable products. 
 The other thingnwe often don't appreciate is,,it's not just at the point of productionnthat poor people suffer.,Poor people also suffernat the point of use.,Those of us who earnna certain income level,,we have something called choice.,The reason why you wantnto work hard and have a job,and not be poor and broke,is so you can have choices,neconomic choices.,We actually get a chancento choose not to use products,that have dangerous,npoisonous plastic in them.,Other people who are poorndon't have those choices.,So low-income people often are the ones,who are buying the products that haventhose dangerous chemicals in them,that their children are using.,Those are the people who wind upningesting a disproportionate amount,of this poisonous plastic in using it.,And people say, "Well, they shouldnjust buy a different product.",Well, the problem with being poornis you don't have those choices.,You often have to buynthe cheapest products.,The cheapest productsnare often the most dangerous. 
 And if that weren't bad enough --,if it wasn't just the productionnof plastic that's giving people cancer,in places like Cancer Alley,,and shortening lives and hurtingnpoor kids at the point of use --,at the point of disposal,,once again, it's poor peoplenwho bear the burden.,Often, we think we're doing a good thing:,You're in your office, drinkingnyour bottled water or whatever it is,,and you think to yourself,n"I'm going to throw this away.,No -- I'm going to be virtuous.nI'm going to put it in the blue bin.",You think, "I put mine in the blue bin.",And then you looknat your colleague and say,,"Why, you cretin!nYou put yours in the white bin.",And we use that as a moral tickle.,We feel so good about ourselves.,If we -- well, OK, I'm just ... me.,Not you, but I feel this way often. 
 (Laughter) 
 And so we kind of haventhis moral feel-good moment.,But if we were to be ablento follow that little bottle,on its journey,,we would be shockednto discover that, all too often,,that bottle is going to be put on a boat,,it's going to go all the waynacross the ocean,at some expense,,and it's going to wind upnin a developing country, often China.,I think in our minds, we imagine,somebody's going to takenthe little bottle and say,,"Oh, little bottle! We're so happynto see you, little bottle." 
 (Laughter) 
 "You've served so well." 
 (Laughter) 
 He's given a little bottle massage,,a little bottle medal.,And they say, "What wouldnyou like to do next?",The little bottle says,n"I just don't know ..." 
 (Laughter) 
 But that's not actually what happens.,You know?,That bottle winds up getting burned.,The recycling of plasticnin many developing countries,means the incineration of the plastic,nthe burning of the plastic,,which releases incredible toxic chemicals,and, once again, kills people.,And so, poor peoplenwho are making these products,in petrochemical centersnlike Cancer Alley,,poor people who are consumingnthese products disproportionately,,and then poor people who,neven at the tail end of the recycling,,are having their lives shortened.,They're all being harmed -- greatly --,by this addiction that we havento disposability. 
 Now, you think to yourself --nI know how you are --,you say, "That sure is terriblenfor those poor people.,It's just awful. Those poor people.,I hope someone doesnsomething to help them.",But what we don't understand is --,here we are in Los Angeles.,We worked very hardnto get the smog reduction,happening here in Los Angeles.,But guess what?,Because they're doing so muchndirty production in Asia now,,because the environmental lawsndon't protect the people in Asia now,,almost all of the clean air gainsnand the toxic air gains,that we've achieved here in California,have been wiped outnby dirty air coming over from Asia.,So we all are being hit.nWe all are being impacted.,It's just that the poor peoplenget it first and worst.,But the dirty production,nthe burning of toxins,,the lack of environmentalnstandards in Asia,,is actually creating so muchndirty air pollution,,it's coming across the ocean,,and has erased our gainsnhere in California.,We're back where we were in the 1970s.,And so we're on one planet,,and we have to be able to getnto the root of these problems. 
 The root of this problem, in my view,,is the idea of disposability itself.,You see, if you understand the link,between what we're doingnto poison and pollute the planet,and what we're doing to poor people,,you arrive at a very troublingnbut also very helpful insight:,In order to trash the planet,,you have to trash people.,But if you create a worldnwhere you don't trash people,,you can't trash the planet.,So now we are at a moment,where the coming togethernof social justice as an idea,and ecology as an idea,,we finally can now see,that they are really,nat the end of the day, one idea.,And it's the idea that we don't havendisposable anything.,We don't have disposable resources.,We don't have disposable species.,And we don't havendisposable people, either.,We don't have a throwaway planet,,and we don't have throwawaynchildren -- it's all precious. 
 And as we all begin to come backnto that basic understanding,,new opportunities for actionnbegin to emerge.,Biomimicry,,which is an emerging science,,winds up being a very importantnsocial justice idea.,People who are justnlearning about this stuff:,biomimicry means respectingnthe wisdom of all species.,Democracy, by the way,,means respecting the wisdomnof all people -- we'll get to that.,But biomimicry meansnrespecting the wisdom of all species.,It turns out we're a prettynclever species.,We have this big cortex,nwe're pretty proud of ourselves.,But if we want to make something hard,,we say, "I know! I'm goingnto make a hard substance.,I know! I'm going to getnvacuums and furnaces,and drag stuff out of the ground,and get things hotnand poison and pollute ...,But I got this hard thing!" 
 (Laughter) 
 "I'm so clever!",And you look behind you,nand there's destruction all around you.,But guess what?,You're so clever,nbut you're not as clever as a clam. 
 A clamshell is hard.,There's no vacuums.nThere's no big furnaces.,There's no poison. There's no pollution.,It turns out that other speciesnfigured out a long time ago,how to create many of the things we need,using biological processesnthat nature knows how to use well.,That insight of biomimicry,nof our scientists finally realizing,that we have as muchnto learn from other species --,I don't mean taking a mousenand sticking it with stuff.,I don't mean looking at it from that way,nabusing the little species.,I mean actually respecting them,nrespecting what they've achieved.,That's called biomimicry,,and that opens the doornto zero waste production;,zero pollution production;,that we could actually enjoy,a high quality of life,na high standard of living,,without trashing the planet. 
 Well, that idea of biomimicry,,respecting the wisdom of all species,,combined with the ideanof democracy and social justice,,respecting the wisdomnand the worth of all people,,would give us a different society.,We would have a different economy.,We would have a green society,that Dr. King would be proud of.,That should be the goal.,And the way that we get therenis to first of all recognize,that the idea of disposability,not only hurts the speciesnwe've talked about,,but it even corrupts our own society. 
 We're so proud to live here in California.,We just had this vote,nand everybody's like,,"Well -- not in our state!" 
 (Laughter) 
 I don't know what thosenother states were doing, but ..." 
 (Laughter) 
 Just so proud.,And, yeah, I'm proud, too.,But ...,California, though we lead the worldnin some of the green stuff,,we also, unfortunately, lead the world,in some of the gulag stuff.,California has one of the highestnincarceration rates,of all the 50 states.,We have a moral challengenin this movement.,We are passionate about rescuingnsome dead materials from the landfill,,but sometimes not as passionate,about rescuing living beings,nliving people.,And I would saynthat we live in a country --,five percent of the world's population,,25 percent of the greenhouse gases,,but also 25 percentnof the world's prisoners.,One of every four peoplenlocked up anywhere in the world,is locked up right herenin the United States.,So that is consistent with this idea,that disposabilitynis something we believe in. 
 And yet,,as a movement that has to broadennits constituency,,that has to grow,,that has to reach outnbeyond our natural comfort zone,,one of the challengesnto the success of this movement,,of getting rid of things like plasticnand helping the economy shift,,is people look at our movementnwith some suspicion.,And they ask a question,nand the question is:,How can these people be so passionate?,A poor person, a low-income person,nsomebody in Cancer Alley,,somebody in Watts,,somebody in Harlem,nsomebody on an Indian reservation,,might say to themselves --nand rightfully so --,"How can these people be so passionate,about making sure,that a plastic bottlenhas a second chance in life,,or an aluminum can has a second chance,,and yet, when my child gets in troublenand goes to prison,,he doesn't get a second chance?","How can this movementnbe so passionate about saying,we don't have throwaway stuff,nno throwaway dead materials,,and yet accept throwaway lives,and throwaway communitiesnlike Cancer Alley?",And so, we now get a chancento be truly proud of this movement.,When we take on topics like this,,it gives us that extra callnto reach out to other movements,and to become more inclusive and to grow,,and we can finally get out ofnthis crazy dilemma that we've been in. 
 Most of you are good, softhearted people.,When you were younger,nyou cared about the whole world,,and at some point, somebody saidnyou had to pick an issue,,you had to boil your lovendown to an issue.,"Can't love the whole world --,you've got to work on treesnor you've got to work on immigration.,You've got to shrink it downnand be about one issue.",And really, they fundamentally told you,,"Are you going to hug a tree?,Or are you going to hug a child? Pick.,Are you going to hug a tree?,Or are you going to hug a child? Pick.",Well, when you start workingnon issues like plastic,,you realize the whole thing is connected.,And luckily, most of us are blessednto have two arms --,we can hug both. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)The first thing I want to do is say thank you to all of you.,The second thing I want to do is introduce my co-author,and dear friend and co-teacher.,Ken and I have been working together,for almost 40 years.,That's Ken Sharpe over there. 
 (Applause) 
 So there is among many people --,certainly me and most of the people I talk to --,a kind of collective dissatisfaction,with the way things are working,,with the way our institutions run.,Our kids' teachers seem to be failing them.,Our doctors don't know who the hell we are,,and they don't have enough time for us.,We certainly can't trust the bankers,,and we certainly can't trust the brokers.,They almost brought the entire financial system down.,And even as we do our own work,,all too often,,we find ourselves having to choose,between doing what we think is the right thing,and doing the expected thing,,or the required thing,,or the profitable thing.,So everywhere we look,,pretty much across the board,,we worry that the people we depend on,don't really have our interests at heart.,Or if they do have our interests at heart,,we worry that they don't know us well enough,to figure out what they need to do,in order to allow us,to secure those interests.,They don't understand us.,They don't have the time to get to know us. 
 There are two kinds of responses,that we make,to this sort of general dissatisfaction.,If things aren't going right,,the first response is:,let's make more rules,,let's set up a set,of detailed procedures,to make sure that people will do the right thing.,Give teachers scripts,to follow in the classroom,,so even if they don't know what they're doing,and don't care about the welfare of our kids,,as long as they follow the scripts,,our kids will get educated.,Give judges a list of mandatory sentences,to impose for crimes,,so that you don't need to rely,on judges using their judgment.,Instead, all they have to do,is look up on the list,what kind of sentence goes with what kind of crime.,Impose limits,on what credit card companies can charge in interest,and on what they can charge in fees.,More and more rules,to protect us,against an indifferent, uncaring,set of institutions we have to deal with. 
 Or -- or maybe and --,in addition to rules,,let's see if we can come up,with some really clever incentives,so that, even if the people we deal with,don't particularly want to serve our interests,,it is in their interest,to serve our interest --,the magic incentives,that will get people to do the right thing,even out of pure selfishness.,So we offer teachers bonuses,if the kids they teach,score passing grades on these big test scores,that are used to evaluate,the quality of school systems. 
 Rules and incentives --,"sticks" and "carrots.",We passed a bunch of rules,to regulate the financial industry,in response to the recent collapse.,There's the Dodd-Frank Act,,there's the new Consumer Financial Protection Agency,that is temporarily being headed through the backdoor,by Elizabeth Warren.,Maybe these rules,will actually improve,the way these financial services companies behave.,We'll see.,In addition, we are struggling,to find some way to create incentives,for people in the financial services industry,that will have them more interested,in serving the long-term interests,even of their own companies,,rather than securing short-term profits.,So if we find just the right incentives,,they'll do the right thing -- as I said -- selfishly,,and if we come up with the right rules and regulations,,they won't drive us all over a cliff.,And Ken [Sharpe] and I certainly know,that you need to reign in the bankers.,If there is a lesson to be learned from the financial collapse,it is that. 
 But what we believe,,and what we argue in the book,,is that there is no set of rules,,no matter how detailed,,no matter how specific,,no matter how carefully monitored,and enforced,,there is no set of rules,that will get us what we need.,Why? Because bankers are smart people.,And, like water,,they will find cracks,in any set of rules.,You design a set of rules that will make sure,that the particular reason,why the financial system "almost-collapse",can't happen again.,It is naive beyond description,to think that having blocked,this source of financial collapse,,you have blocked all possible sources of financial collapse.,So it's just a question of waiting for the next one,and then marveling at how we could have been so stupid,as not to protect ourselves against that. 
 What we desperately need,,beyond, or along with, better rules,and reasonably smart incentives,,is we need virtue.,We need character.,We need people who want to do the right thing.,And in particular,,the virtue that we need most of all,is the virtue that Aristotle called,"practical wisdom.",Practical wisdom,is the moral will,to do the right thing,and the moral skill,to figure out what the right thing is.,So Aristotle was very interested in watching,how the craftsmen around him worked.,And he was impressed,at how they would improvise,novel solutions to novel problems --,problems that they hadn't anticipated.,So one example is he sees these stonemasons,working on the Isle of Lesbos,,and they need to measure out,round columns.,Well if you think about it,,it's really hard to measure out round columns using a ruler.,So what do they do?,They fashion a novel solution to the problem.,They created a ruler that bends,,what we would call these days a tape measure --,a flexible rule,,a rule that bends.,And Aristotle said,,"Hah, they appreciated that sometimes,to design rounded columns,,you need to bend the rule.",And Aristotle said,often in dealing with other people,,we need to bend the rules. 
 Dealing with other people,demands a kind of flexibility,that no set of rules can encompass.,Wise people know when and how,to bend the rules.,Wise people know how to improvise.,The way my co-author , Ken, and I talk about it,,they are kind of like jazz musicians.,The rules are like the notes on the page,,and that gets you started,,but then you dance around the notes on the page,,coming up with just the right combination,for this particular moment,with this particular set of fellow players.,So for Aristotle,,the kind,of rule-bending,,rule exception-finding and improvisation,that you see in skilled craftsmen,is exactly what you need,to be a skilled moral craftsman.,And in interactions with people,,almost all the time,,it is this kind of flexibility that is required.,A wise person knows when to bend the rules.,A wise person knows when to improvise.,And most important,,a wise person does this improvising and rule-bending,in the service of the right aims.,If you are a rule-bender and an improviser,mostly to serve yourself,,what you get is ruthless manipulation of other people.,So it matters that you do this wise practice,in the service of others,and not in the service of yourself.,And so the will to do the right thing,is just as important as the moral skill,of improvisation,and exception-finding.,Together they comprise practical wisdom,,which Aristotle thought,was the master virtue. 
 So I'll give you an example,of wise practice in action.,It's the case of Michael.,Michael's a young guy.,He had a pretty low-wage job.,He was supporting his wife and a child,,and the child was going to parochial school.,Then he lost his job.,He panicked,about being able to support his family.,One night, he drank a little too much,,and he robbed a cab driver --,stole 50 dollars.,He robbed him at gunpoint.,It was a toy gun.,He got caught. He got tried.,He got convicted.,The Pennsylvania sentencing guidelines,required a minimum sentence for a crime like this,of two years, 24 months.,The judge on the case, Judge Lois Forer,thought that this made no sense.,He had never committed a crime before.,He was a responsible husband and father.,He had been faced with desperate circumstances.,All this would do is wreck a family.,And so she improvised a sentence -- 11 months,,and not only that,,but release every day to go to work.,Spend your night in jail, spend your day holding down a job.,He did. He served out his sentence.,He made restitution,and found himself a new job.,And the family was united. 
 And it seemed on the road,to some sort of a decent life --,a happy ending to a story,involving wise improvisation,from a wise judge.,But it turned out,the prosecutor was not happy,that Judge Forer ignored the sentencing guidelines,and sort of invented her own,,and so he appealed.,And he asked for the mandatory minimum sentence,for armed robbery.,He did after all have a toy gun.,The mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery,is five years.,He won the appeal.,Michael was sentenced to five years in prison.,Judge Forer had to follow the law.,And by the way, this appeal went through,after he had finished serving his sentence,,so he was out and working at a job,and taking care of his family,and he had to go back into jail.,Judge Forer did what she was required to do,,and then she quit the bench.,And Michael disappeared.,So that is an example,,both of wisdom in practice,and the subversion of wisdom,by rules that are meant, of course, to make things better. 
 Now consider Ms. Dewey.,Ms. Dewey's a teacher in a Texas elementary school.,She found herself listening to a consultant one day,who was trying to help teachers,boost the test scores of the kids,,so that the school,would reach the elite category,in percentage of kids passing big tests.,All these schools in Texas compete with one another,to achieve these milestones,,and there are bonuses and various other treats,that come if you beat the other schools.,So here was the consultant's advice:,first, don't waste your time on kids,who are going to pass the test no matter what you do.,Second, don't waste your time,on kids who can't pass the test,no matter what you do.,Third, don't waste your time,on kids who moved into the district,too late for their scores to be counted.,Focus all of your time and attention,on the kids who are on the bubble,,the so-called "bubble kids" --,kids where your intervention,can get them just maybe over the line,from failing to passing.,So Ms. Dewey heard this,,and she shook her head in despair,while fellow teachers were sort of cheering each other on,and nodding approvingly.,It's like they were about to go play a football game.,For Ms. Dewey,,this isn't why she became a teacher. 
 Now Ken and I are not naive,,and we understand that you need to have rules.,You need to have incentives.,People have to make a living.,But the problem,with relying on rules and incentives,is that they demoralize,professional activity,,and they demoralize professional activity,in two senses.,First, they demoralize the people,who are engaged in the activity.,Judge Forer quits,,and Ms. Dewey in completely disheartened.,And second,,they demoralize the activity itself.,The very practice is demoralized,,and the practitioners are demoralized.,It creates people --,when you manipulate incentives to get people to do the right thing --,it creates people,who are addicted to incentives.,That is to say, it creates people,who only do things for incentives. 
 Now the striking thing about this,is that psychologists have known this,for 30 years.,Psychologists have known,about the negative consequences of incentivizing everything,for 30 years.,We know that if you reward kids for drawing pictures,,they stop caring about the drawing,and care only about the reward.,If you reward kids for reading books,,they stop caring about what's in the books,and only care about how long they are.,If you reward teachers for kids' test scores,,they stop caring about educating,and only care about test preparation.,If you were to reward doctors,for doing more procedures --,which is the current system -- they would do more.,If instead you reward doctors for doing fewer procedures,,they will do fewer.,What we want, of course,,is doctors who do just the right amount of procedures,and do the right amount for the right reason --,namely, to serve the welfare of their patients.,Psychologists have known this for decades,,and it's time for policymakers,to start paying attention,and listen to psychologists a little bit,,instead of economists. 
 And it doesn't have to be this way.,We think, Ken and I, that there are real sources of hope.,We identify one set of people,in all of these practices,who we call canny outlaws.,These are people,who, being forced to operate,in a system that demands rule-following,and creates incentives,,find away around the rules,,find a way to subvert the rules.,So there are teachers who have these scripts to follow,,and they know that if they follow these scripts, the kids will learn nothing.,And so what they do is they follow the scripts,,but they follow the scripts at double-time,and squirrel away little bits of extra time,during which they teach in the way,that they actually know is effective.,So these are little ordinary, everyday heroes,,and they're incredibly admirable,,but there's no way that they can sustain this kind of activity,in the face of a system,that either roots them out,or grinds them down. 
 So canny outlaws are better than nothing,,but it's hard to imagine any canny outlaw,sustaining that for an indefinite period of time.,More hopeful,are people we call system-changers.,These are people who are looking,not to dodge the system's rules and regulations,,but to transform the system,,and we talk about several.,One in particular,is a judge named Robert Russell.,And one day he was faced,with the case of Gary Pettengill.,Pettengill was a 23-year-old vet,who had planned to make the army a career,,but then he got a severe back injury in Iraq,,and that forced him to take a medical discharge.,He was married, he had a third kid on the way,,he suffered from PTSD, in addition to the bad back,,and recurrent nightmares,,and he had started using marijuana,to ease some of the symptoms.,He was only able to get part-time work because of his back,,and so he was unable to earn enough to put food on the table,and take care of his family.,So he started selling marijuana.,He was busted in a drug sweep.,His family was kicked out of their apartment,,and the welfare system,was threatening to take away his kids. 
 Under normal sentencing procedures,,Judge Russell would have had little choice,but to sentence Pettengill to serious jail-time,as a drug felon.,But Judge Russell did have an alternative.,And that's because he was in a special court.,He was in a court called the Veterans' Court.,In the Veterans' Court --,this was the first of its kind in the United States.,Judge Russell created the Veterans' Court.,It was a court only for veterans,who had broken the law.,And he had created it exactly because,mandatory sentencing laws,were taking the judgment out of judging.,No one wanted non-violent offenders --,and especially non-violent offenders who were veterans to boot --,to be thrown into prison.,They wanted to do something about what we all know,,namely the revolving door of the criminal justice system.,And what the Veterans' Court did,,was it treated each criminal as an individual,,tried to get inside their problems,,tried to fashion responses to their crimes,that helped them to rehabilitate themselves,,and didn't forget about them once the judgment was made.,Stayed with them, followed up on them,,made sure that they were sticking to whatever plan,had been jointly developed,to get them over the hump. 
 There are now 22 cities,that have Veterans' Courts like this.,Why has the idea spread?,Well, one reason is,that Judge Russell,has now seen 108 vets,in his Veterans' Court,as of February of this year,,and out of 108,,guess how many have gone back through,the revolving door of justice,into prison.,None. None.,Anyone would glom onto,a criminal justice system,that has this kind of a record.,So here's is a system-changer, and it seems to be catching. 
 There's a banker,who created a for-profit community bank,that encouraged bankers -- I know this is hard to believe --,encouraged bankers who worked there to do well,by doing good for their low-income clients.,The bank helped finance the rebuilding,of what was otherwise a dying community.,Though their loan recipients were high-risk by ordinary standards,,the default rate was extremely low.,The bank was profitable.,The bankers stayed with their loan recipients.,They didn't make loans and then sell the loans.,They serviced the loans.,They made sure that their loan recipients,were staying up with their payments.,Banking hasn't always been,the way we read about it now in the newspapers.,Even Goldman Sachs,once used to serve clients,,before it turned into an institution,that serves only itself.,Banking wasn't always this way,,and it doesn't have to be this way. 
 So there are examples like this in medicine --,doctors at Harvard,who are trying to transform medical education,,so that you don't get a kind of ethical erosion,and loss of empathy,,which characterizes most medical students,in the course of their medical training.,And the way they do it is to give third-year medical students,patients who they follow for an entire year.,So the patients are not organ systems,,and they're not diseases;,they're people, people with lives.,And in order to be an effective doctor,,you need to treat people who have lives and not just disease.,In addition to which there's an enormous amount of back and forth,,mentoring of one student by another,,of all the students by the doctors,,and the result is a generation -- we hope -- of doctors,who do have time for the people they treat.,We'll see. 
 So there are lots of examples like this that we talk about.,Each of them shows that it is possible,to build on and nurture character,and keep a profession,true to its proper mission --,what Aristotle would have called its proper telos.,And Ken and I believe,that this is what practitioners actually want.,People want to be allowed,to be virtuous.,They want to have permission to do the right thing.,They don't want to feel,like they need to take a shower,to get the moral grime off their bodies everyday,when they come home from work. 
 Aristotle thought that practical wisdom,was the key to happiness,,and he was right.,There's now a lot of research being done in psychology,on what makes people happy,,and the two things that jump out in study after study --,I know this will come as a shock to all of you --,the two things that matter most to happiness,are love and work.,Love: managing successfully,relations with the people who are close to you,and with the communities of which you are a part.,Work: engaging in activities,that are meaningful and satisfying.,If you have that, good close relations with other people,,work that's meaningful and fulfilling,,you don't much need anything else. 
 Well, to love well and to work well,,you need wisdom.,Rules and incentives don't tell you,how to be a good friend, how to be a good parent,,how to be a good spouse,,or how to be a good doctor or a good lawyer,or a good teacher.,Rules and incentives,are no substitutes for wisdom.,Indeed, we argue,,there is no substitute for wisdom.,And so practical wisdom,does not require,heroic acts of self-sacrifice,on the part of practitioners.,In giving us the will and the skill,to do the right thing -- to do right by others --,practical wisdom also gives us,the will and the skill,to do right by ourselves. 
 Thanks. 
 (Applause)So what does the happiest man in the world look like?,He certainly doesn't look like me.,He looks like this.,His name is Matthieu Ricard.,So how do you get to be the happiest man in the world?,Well it turns out,there is a way to measure happiness in the brain.,And you do that by measuring the relative activation,of the left prefrontal cortex in the fMRI,,versus the right prefrontal cortex.,And Matthieu's happiness measure,is off the charts.,He's by far the happiest man,ever measured by science.,Which leads us to a question:,What was he thinking when he was being measured?,Perhaps something very naughty.,(Laughter),Actually, he was meditating,on compassion.,Matthieu's own experience,is that compassion is the happiest state ever. 
 Reading about Matthieu,was one of the pivotal moments of my life.,My dream,is to create the conditions,for world peace in my lifetime --,and to do that,by creating the conditions,for inner peace,and compassion,on a global scale.,And learning about Matthieu,gave me a new angle to look at my work.,Matthieu's brain scan shows,that compassion is not a chore.,Compassion is something that creates happiness.,Compassion is fun.,And that mind-blowing insight,changes the entire game.,Because if compassion was a chore,,nobody's going to do it,,except maybe the Dalai Lama or something.,But if compassion was fun,,everybody's going to do it.,Therefore,,to create the conditions for global compassion,,all we have to do,is to reframe compassion,as something that is fun. 
 But fun is not enough.,What if compassion,is also profitable?,What if compassion is also good for business?,Then, every boss, every manager in the world,,will want to have compassion --,like this.,That would create the conditions,for world peace.,So, I started paying attention,to what compassion looks like in a business setting.,Fortunately, I didn't have to look very far.,Because what I was looking for was right in front of my eyes --,in Google, my company. 
 I know there are other compassionate companies in the world,,but Google is the place I'm familiar with,because I've been there for 10 years,,so I'll use Google as the case study.,Google is a company,born of idealism.,It's a company that thrives on idealism.,And maybe because of that,,compassion is organic,and widespread company-wide.,In Google, expressions of corporate compassion,almost always follow the same pattern.,It's sort of a funny pattern.,It starts with a small group of Googlers,taking the initiative to do something.,And they don't usually ask for permission;,they just go ahead and do it,,and then other Googlers join in, and it just gets bigger and bigger.,And sometimes it gets big enough,to become official.,So in other words,,it almost always starts from the bottom up. 
 And let me give you some examples.,The first example is the largest annual community event --,where Googlers from around the world,donate their labor to their local communities --,was initiated and organized,by three employees,before it became official,,because it just became too big.,Another example, three Googlers --,a chef, an engineer,and, most funny, a massage therapist --,three of them, they learned about a region in India,where 200,000 people live,without a single medical facility.,So what do they do?,They just go ahead and start a fundraiser.,And they raise enough money to build this hospital --,the first hospital of its kind,for 200,000 people.,During the Haiti earthquake,,a number of engineers and product managers,spontaneously came together,and stayed overnight,to build a tool,to allow earthquake victims to find their loved ones.,And expressions of compassion,are also found in our international offices. 
 In China for example,,one mid-level employee,initiated the largest social action competition in China,,involving more than 1,000 schools in China,,working on issues,such as education, poverty,,health care and the environment.,There is so much organic social action,all around Google,that the company decided to form,a social responsibility team,just to support these efforts.,And this idea, again,,came from the grassroots,,from two Googlers who wrote their own job descriptions,and volunteered themselves for the job.,And I found it fascinating,that the social responsibility team,was not formed as part of some grand corporate strategy.,It was two persons saying, "Let's do this,",and the company said, "Yes.",So it turns out,that Google is a compassionate company,,because Googlers found,compassion to be fun. 
 But again, fun is not enough.,There are also real business benefits.,So what are they?,The first benefit of compassion,is that it creates highly effective business leaders.,What does that mean?,There are three components of compassion.,There is the affective component,,which is, "I feel for you.",There is the cognitive component,,which is, "I understand you.",And there is a motivational component,,which is, "I want to help you.",So what has this got to do with business leadership?,According to a very comprehensive study,led by Jim Collins,,and documented in the book "Good to Great,",it takes a very special kind of leader,to bring a company,from goodness to greatness.,And he calls them "Level 5 leaders.",These are leaders,who, in addition to being highly capable,,possess two important qualities,,and they are,humility and ambition.,These are leaders,who are highly ambitious for the greater good.,And because they're ambitious for a greater good,,they feel no need to inflate their own egos.,And they, according to the research,,make the best business leaders.,And if you look at these qualities,in the context of compassion,,we find,that the cognitive and affective components of compassion --,understanding people and empathizing with people --,inhibits, tones down,,what I call the excessive self-obsession that's in us,,therefore creating the conditions,for humility. 
 The motivational component of compassion,creates ambition for greater good.,In other words,,compassion is the way to grow Level 5 leaders.,And this is the first compelling business benefit.,The second compelling benefit of compassion,is that it creates an inspiring workforce.,Employees mutually inspire each other,towards greater good.,It creates a vibrant, energetic community,where people admire and respect each other.,I mean, you come to work in the morning,,and you work with three guys,who just up and decide to build a hospital in India.,It's like how can you not be inspired by those people --,your own coworkers?,So this mutual inspiration,promotes collaboration,,initiative and creativity.,It makes us a highly effective company. 
 So, having said all that,,what is the secret formula,for brewing compassion,in the corporate setting?,In our experience,,there are three ingredients.,The first ingredient,is to create a culture,of passionate concern,for the greater good.,So always think:,how is your company and your job,serving the greater good?,Or, how can you further serve,the greater good?,This awareness of serving the greater good,is very self-inspiring,and it creates fertile ground,for compassion to grow in.,That's one. 
 The second ingredient,is autonomy.,So in Google, there's a lot of autonomy.,And one of our most popular managers jokes that,,this is what he says,,"Google is a place,where the inmates run the asylum.",And he considers himself one of the inmates.,If you already have,a culture of compassion,and idealism,and you let your people roam free,,they will do the right thing,in the most compassionate way. 
 The third ingredient,is to focus on inner development,and personal growth.,Leadership training in Google, for example,,places a lot of emphasis on the inner qualities,,such as self-awareness, self-mastery,,empathy and compassion,,because we believe,that leadership begins,with character.,We even created a seven-week curriculum,on emotion intelligence,,which we jokingly call "Searching Inside Yourself.",It's less naughty than it sounds.,So I'm an engineer by training,,but I'm one of the creators and instructors of this course,,which I find kind of funny,,because this is a company that trusts an engineer,to teach emotion intelligence.,What a company. 
 (Laughter) 
 So "Search Inside Yourself" -- how does it work?,It works in three steps.,The first step,is attention training.,Attention is the basis,of all higher cognitive and emotional abilities.,Therefore, any curriculum,for training emotion intelligence,has to begin with attention training.,The idea here is to train attention,to create a quality of mind,that is calm and clear,at the same time.,And this creates the foundation,for emotion intelligence.,The second step follows the first step. 
 The second step is developing self-knowledge,and self-mastery.,So using the supercharged attention from step one,,we create a high-resolution perception,into the cognitive and emotive processes.,What does that mean?,It means being able to observe our thought stream,and the process of emotion,with high clarity,,objectivity,and from a third-person perspective.,And once you can do that,,you create the kind of self-knowledge,that enables self-mastery. 
 The third step, following the second step,,is to create new mental habits.,What does that mean? Imagine this.,Imagine whenever you meet any other person,,any time you meet a person,,your habitual, instinctive first thought,is, "I want you to be happy.,I want you to be happy.",Imagine you can do that.,Having this habit, this mental habit,,changes everything at work.,Because this good will,is unconsciously picked up by other people,,and it creates trust,,and trust creates a lot of good working relationships.,And this also creates the conditions,for compassion in the workplace.,Someday, we hope to open-source,"Search Inside Yourself",so that everybody in the corporate world,will at least be able to use it as a reference. 
 And in closing,,I want to end the same place I started,,with happiness.,I want to quote this guy -- the guy in robes, not the other guy --,the Dalai Lama,,who said, "If you want others to be happy,,practice compassion.,If you want to be happy,,practice compassion.",I found this to be true,,both on the individual level,and at a corporate level.,And I hope that compassion,will be both fun and profitable for you too. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)We're here to celebrate compassion.,But compassion, from my vantage point,,has a problem.,As essential as it is across our traditions,,as real as so many of us know it to be,in particular lives,,the word "compassion" is hollowed out in our culture,,and it is suspect in my field of journalism.,It's seen as a squishy kumbaya thing,,or it's seen as potentially depressing.,Karen Armstrong has told what I think is an iconic story,of giving a speech in Holland,and, after the fact, the word "compassion",was translated as "pity." 
 Now compassion, when it enters the news,,too often comes in the form,of feel-good feature pieces,or sidebars about heroic people,you could never be like,or happy endings,or examples of self-sacrifice,that would seem to be too good to be true,most of the time.,Our cultural imagination about compassion,has been deadened by idealistic images.,And so what I'd like to do this morning,for the next few minutes,is perform a linguistic resurrection.,And I hope you'll come with me on my basic premise,that words matter,,that they shape the way we understand ourselves,,the way we interpret the world,and the way we treat others. 
 When this country,first encountered genuine diversity,in the 1960s,,we adopted tolerance,as the core civic virtue,with which we would approach that.,Now the word "tolerance," if you look at it in the dictionary,,connotes "allowing," "indulging",and "enduring.",In the medical context that it comes from,,it is about testing the limits of thriving,in an unfavorable environment.,Tolerance is not really a lived virtue;,it's more of a cerebral ascent.,And it's too cerebral,to animate guts and hearts,and behavior,when the going gets rough.,And the going is pretty rough right now.,I think that without perhaps being able to name it,,we are collectively experiencing,that we've come as far as we can,with tolerance as our only guiding virtue. 
 Compassion is a worthy successor.,It is organic,,across our religious, spiritual and ethical traditions,,and yet it transcends them.,Compassion is a piece of vocabulary,that could change us if we truly let it sink into,the standards to which we hold ourselves and others,,both in our private and in our civic spaces.,So what is it, three-dimensionally?,What are its kindred and component parts?,What's in its universe of attendant virtues?,To start simply,,I want to say that compassion is kind.,Now "kindness" might sound like a very mild word,,and it's prone to its own abundant cliche.,But kindness is an everyday byproduct,of all the great virtues.,And it is a most edifying form,of instant gratification. 
 Compassion is also curious.,Compassion cultivates and practices curiosity.,I love a phrase that was offered me,by two young women,who are interfaith innovators in Los Angeles,,Aziza Hasan and Malka Fenyvesi.,They are working to create a new imagination,about shared life among young Jews and Muslims,,and as they do that, they cultivate what they call,"curiosity without assumptions.",Well that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion. 
 Compassion can be synonymous with empathy.,It can be joined with the harder work,of forgiveness and reconciliation,,but it can also express itself,in the simple act of presence.,It's linked to practical virtues,like generosity and hospitality,and just being there,,just showing up.,I think that compassion,also is often linked to beauty --,and by that I mean a willingness,to see beauty in the other,,not just what it is about them,that might need helping.,I love it that my Muslim conversation partners,often speak of beauty as a core moral value.,And in that light, for the religious,,compassion also brings us,into the territory of mystery --,encouraging us not just,to see beauty,,but perhaps also to look for the face of God,in the moment of suffering,,in the face of a stranger,,in the face of the vibrant religious other. 
 I'm not sure if I can show you,what tolerance looks like,,but I can show you what compassion looks like --,because it is visible.,When we see it, we recognize it,and it changes the way we think about what is doable,,what is possible.,It is so important,when we're communicating big ideas --,but especially a big spiritual idea like compassion --,to root it as we present it to others,in space and time and flesh and blood --,the color and complexity of life. 
 And compassion does seek physicality.,I first started to learn this most vividly,from Matthew Sanford.,And I don't imagine that you will realize this,when you look at this photograph of him,,but he's paraplegic.,He's been paralyzed from the waist down since he was 13,,in a car crash that killed his father and his sister.,Matthew's legs don't work, and he'll never walk again,,and -- and he does experience this as an "and",rather than a "but" --,and he experiences himself,to be healed and whole.,And as a teacher of yoga,,he brings that experience to others,across the spectrum of ability and disability,,health, illness and aging.,He says that he's just at an extreme end,of the spectrum we're all on.,He's doing some amazing work now,with veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan.,And Matthew has made this remarkable observation,that I'm just going to offer you and let it sit.,I can't quite explain it, and he can't either.,But he says that he has yet to experience someone,who became more aware of their body,,in all its frailty and its grace,,without, at the same time,,becoming more compassionate towards all of life. 
 Compassion also looks like this.,This is Jean Vanier.,Jean Vanier helped found the L'Arche communities,,which you can now find all over the world,,communities centered around life,with people with mental disabilities --,mostly Down syndrome.,The communities that Jean Vanier founded,,like Jean Vanier himself,,exude tenderness.,"Tender" is another word,I would love to spend some time resurrecting.,We spend so much time in this culture,being driven and aggressive,,and I spend a lot of time being those things too.,And compassion can also have those qualities.,But again and again, lived compassion,brings us back to the wisdom of tenderness.,Jean Vanier says,that his work,,like the work of other people --,his great, beloved, late friend Mother Teresa --,is never in the first instance about changing the world;,it's in the first instance about changing ourselves.,He's says that what they do with L'Arche,is not a solution, but a sign.,Compassion is rarely a solution,,but it is always a sign of a deeper reality,,of deeper human possibilities. 
 And compassion is unleashed,in wider and wider circles,by signs and stories,,never by statistics and strategies.,We need those things too,,but we're also bumping up against their limits.,And at the same time that we are doing that,,I think we are rediscovering the power of story --,that as human beings, we need stories,to survive, to flourish,,to change.,Our traditions have always known this,,and that is why they have always cultivated stories at their heart,and carried them forward in time for us.,There is, of course, a story,behind the key moral longing,and commandment of Judaism,to repair the world -- tikkun olam. 
 And I'll never forget hearing that story,from Dr. Rachel Naomi Remen,,who told it to me as her grandfather told it to her,,that in the beginning of the Creation,something happened,and the original light of the universe,was shattered into countless pieces.,It lodged as shards,inside every aspect of the Creation.,And that the highest human calling,is to look for this light, to point at it when we see it,,to gather it up,,and in so doing, to repair the world.,Now this might sound like a fanciful tale.,Some of my fellow journalists might interpret it that way.,Rachel Naomi Remen says,this is an important and empowering story,for our time,,because this story insists,that each and every one of us,,frail and flawed as we may be,,inadequate as we may feel,,has exactly what's needed,to help repair the part of the world,that we can see and touch. 
 Stories like this,,signs like this,,are practical tools,in a world longing to bring compassion,to abundant images of suffering,that can otherwise overwhelm us.,Rachel Naomi Remen,is actually bringing compassion,back to its rightful place alongside science,in her field of medicine,in the training of new doctors.,And this trend,of what Rachel Naomi Remen is doing,,how these kinds of virtues,are finding a place in the vocabulary of medicine --,the work Fred Luskin is doing --,I think this is one of the most fascinating developments,of the 21st century --,that science, in fact,,is taking a virtue like compassion,definitively out of the realm of idealism.,This is going to change science, I believe,,and it will change religion. 
 But here's a face,from 20th century science,that might surprise you,in a discussion about compassion.,We all know about the Albert Einstein,who came up with E = mc2.,We don't hear so much about the Einstein,who invited the African American opera singer, Marian Anderson,,to stay in his home when she came to sing in Princeton,because the best hotel there,was segregated and wouldn't have her.,We don't hear about the Einstein who used his celebrity,to advocate for political prisoners in Europe,or the Scottsboro boys,in the American South. 
 Einstein believed deeply,that science should transcend,national and ethnic divisions.,But he watched physicists and chemists,become the purveyors of weapons of mass destruction,in the early 20th century.,He once said that science in his generation,had become like a razor blade,in the hands of a three-year-old.,And Einstein foresaw,that as we grow more modern,and technologically advanced,,we need the virtues,our traditions carry forward in time,more, not less.,He liked to talk about the spiritual geniuses of the ages.,Some of his favorites were Moses,,Jesus, Buddha, St. Francis of Assisi,,Gandhi -- he adored his contemporary, Gandhi.,And Einstein said --,and I think this is a quote,,again, that has not been passed down in his legacy --,that "these kinds of people,are geniuses in the art of living,,more necessary,to the dignity, security and joy of humanity,than the discoverers of objective knowledge." 
 Now invoking Einstein,might not seem the best way to bring compassion down to earth,and make it seem accessible to all the rest of us,,but actually it is.,I want to show you,the rest of this photograph,,because this photograph,is analogous to what we do to the word "compassion" in our culture --,we clean it up,and we diminish its depths and its grounding,in life, which is messy.,So in this photograph,you see a mind looking out a window,at what might be a cathedral -- it's not.,This is the full photograph,,and you see a middle-aged man wearing a leather jacket,,smoking a cigar.,And by the look of that paunch,,he hasn't been doing enough yoga.,We put these two photographs side-by-side on our website,,and someone said, "When I look at the first photo,,I ask myself, what was he thinking?,And when I look at the second, I ask,,what kind of person was he? What kind of man is this?" 
 Well, he was complicated.,He was incredibly compassionate,in some of his relationships,and terribly inadequate in others.,And it is much harder, often,,to be compassionate towards those closest to us,,which is another quality in the universe of compassion,,on its dark side,,that also deserves our serious attention and illumination.,Gandhi, too, was a real flawed human being.,So was Martin Luther King, Jr. So was Dorothy Day.,So was Mother Teresa.,So are we all.,And I want to say,that it is a liberating thing,to realize that that is no obstacle to compassion --,following on what Fred Luskin says --,that these flaws just make us human. 
 Our culture is obsessed with perfection,and with hiding problems.,But what a liberating thing to realize,that our problems, in fact,,are probably our richest sources,for rising to this ultimate virtue of compassion,,towards bringing compassion,towards the suffering and joys of others.,Rachel Naomi Remen is a better doctor,because of her life-long struggle with Crohn's disease.,Einstein became a humanitarian,,not because of his exquisite knowledge,of space and time and matter,,but because he was a Jew as Germany grew fascist.,And Karen Armstrong, I think you would also say,that it was some of your very wounding experiences,in a religious life that,,with a zigzag,,have led to the Charter for Compassion.,Compassion can't be reduced to sainthood,any more than it can be reduced to pity. 
 So I want to propose,a final definition of compassion --,this is Einstein with Paul Robeson by the way --,and that would be for us,to call compassion a spiritual technology.,Now our traditions contain,vast wisdom about this,,and we need them to mine it for us now.,But compassion is also equally at home,in the secular as in the religious. 
 So I will paraphrase Einstein in closing,and say that humanity,,the future of humanity,,needs this technology,as much as it needs all the others,that have now connected us,and set before us,the terrifying and wondrous possibility,of actually becoming one human race. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I will start by posing a little bit of a challenge:,the challenge of dealing with data,,data that we have to deal with,in medical situations.,It's really a huge challenge for us.,And this is our beast of burden --,this is a Computer Tomography machine,,a CT machine.,It's a fantastic device.,It uses X-rays, X-ray beams,,that are rotating very fast around the human body.,It takes about 30 seconds to go through the whole machine,and is generating enormous amounts of information,that comes out of the machine.,So this is a fantastic machine,that we can use,for improving health care,,but as I said, it's also a challenge for us.,And the challenge is really found in this picture here.,It's the medical data explosion,that we're having right now.,We're facing this problem.,And let me step back in time. 
 Let's go back a few years in time and see what happened back then.,These machines that came out --,they started coming in the 1970s --,they would scan human bodies,,and they would generate about 100 images,of the human body.,And I've taken the liberty, just for clarity,,to translate that to data slices.,That would correspond to about 50 megabytes of data,,which is small,when you think about the data we can handle today,just on normal mobile devices.,If you translate that to phone books,,it's about one meter of phone books in the pile.,Looking at what we're doing today,with these machines that we have,,we can, just in a few seconds,,get 24,000 images out of a body,,and that would correspond to about 20 gigabytes of data,,or 800 phone books,,and the pile would then be 200 meters of phone books.,What's about to happen --,and we're seeing this; it's beginning --,a technology trend that's happening right now,is that we're starting to look at time-resolved situations as well.,So we're getting the dynamics out of the body as well.,And just assume,that we will be collecting data during five seconds,,and that would correspond to one terabyte of data --,that's 800,000 books,and 16 kilometers of phone books.,That's one patient, one data set.,And this is what we have to deal with. 
 So this is really the enormous challenge that we have.,And already today -- this is 25,000 images.,Imagine the days,when we had radiologists doing this.,They would put up 25,000 images,,they would go like this, "25,0000, okay, okay.,There is the problem.",They can't do that anymore. That's impossible.,So we have to do something that's a little bit more intelligent than doing this.,So what we do is that we put all these slices together.,Imagine that you slice your body in all these directions,,and then you try to put the slices back together again,into a pile of data, into a block of data.,So this is really what we're doing.,So this gigabyte or terabyte of data, we're putting it into this block.,But of course, the block of data,just contains the amount of X-ray,that's been absorbed in each point in the human body.,So what we need to do is to figure out a way,of looking at the things we do want to look at,and make things transparent that we don't want to look at.,So transforming the data set,into something that looks like this.,And this is a challenge.,This is a huge challenge for us to do that. 
 Using computers, even though they're getting faster and better all the time,,it's a challenge to deal with gigabytes of data,,terabytes of data,and extracting the relevant information.,I want to look at the heart.,I want to look at the blood vessels. I want to look at the liver.,Maybe even find a tumor,,in some cases.,So this is where this little dear comes into play.,This is my daughter.,This is as of 9 a.m. this morning.,She's playing a computer game.,She's only two years old,,and she's having a blast.,So she's really the driving force,behind the development of graphics-processing units.,As long as kids are playing computer games,,graphics is getting better and better and better.,So please go back home, tell your kids to play more games,,because that's what I need. 
 So what's inside of this machine,is what enables me to do the things that I'm doing,with the medical data.,So really what I'm doing is using these fantastic little devices.,And you know, going back,maybe 10 years in time,when I got the funding,to buy my first graphics computer --,it was a huge machine.,It was cabinets of processors and storage and everything.,I paid about one million dollars for that machine.,That machine is, today, about as fast as my iPhone.,So every month there are new graphics cards coming out,,and here is a few of the latest ones from the vendors --,NVIDIA, ATI, Intel is out there as well.,And you know, for a few hundred bucks,you can get these things and put them into your computer,,and you can do fantastic things with these graphics cards.,So this is really what's enabling us,to deal with the explosion of data in medicine,,together with some really nifty work,in terms of algorithms --,compressing data,,extracting the relevant information that people are doing research on. 
 So I'm going to show you a few examples of what we can do.,This is a data set that was captured using a CT scanner.,You can see that this is a full data [set].,It's a woman. You can see the hair.,You can see the individual structures of the woman.,You can see that there is [a] scattering of X-rays,on the teeth, the metal in the teeth.,That's where those artifacts are coming from.,But fully interactively,on standard graphics cards on a normal computer,,I can just put in a clip plane.,And of course all the data is inside,,so I can start rotating, I can look at it from different angles,,and I can see that this woman had a problem.,She had a bleeding up in the brain,,and that's been fixed with a little stent,,a metal clamp that's tightening up the vessel.,And just by changing the functions,,then I can decide what's going to be transparent,and what's going to be visible.,I can look at the skull structure,,and I can see that, okay, this is where they opened up the skull on this woman,,and that's where they went in.,So these are fantastic images.,They're really high resolution,,and they're really showing us what we can do,with standard graphics cards today. 
 Now we have really made use of this,,and we have tried to squeeze a lot of data,into the system.,And one of the applications that we've been working on --,and this has gotten a little bit of traction worldwide --,is the application of virtual autopsies.,So again, looking at very, very large data sets,,and you saw those full-body scans that we can do.,We're just pushing the body through the whole CT scanner,,and just in a few seconds we can get a full-body data set.,So this is from a virtual autopsy.,And you can see how I'm gradually peeling off.,First you saw the body bag that the body came in,,then I'm peeling off the skin -- you can see the muscles --,and eventually you can see the bone structure of this woman. 
 Now at this point, I would also like to emphasize,that, with the greatest respect,for the people that I'm now going to show --,I'm going to show you a few cases of virtual autopsies --,so it's with great respect for the people,that have died under violent circumstances,that I'm showing these pictures to you.,In the forensic case --,and this is something,that ... there's been approximately 400 cases so far,just in the part of Sweden that I come from,that has been undergoing virtual autopsies,in the past four years.,So this will be the typical workflow situation.,The police will decide --,in the evening, when there's a case coming in --,they will decide, okay, is this a case where we need to do an autopsy?,So in the morning, in between six and seven in the morning,,the body is then transported inside of the body bag,to our center,and is being scanned through one of the CT scanners.,And then the radiologist, together with the pathologist,and sometimes the forensic scientist,,looks at the data that's coming out,,and they have a joint session.,And then they decide what to do in the real physical autopsy after that. 
 Now looking at a few cases,,here's one of the first cases that we had.,You can really see the details of the data set.,It's very high-resolution,,and it's our algorithms that allow us,to zoom in on all the details.,And again, it's fully interactive,,so you can rotate and you can look at things in real time,on these systems here.,Without saying too much about this case,,this is a traffic accident,,a drunk driver hit a woman.,And it's very, very easy to see the damages on the bone structure.,And the cause of death is the broken neck.,And this women also ended up under the car,,so she's quite badly beaten up,by this injury. 
 Here's another case, a knifing.,And this is also again showing us what we can do.,It's very easy to look at metal artifacts,that we can show inside of the body.,You can also see some of the artifacts from the teeth --,that's actually the filling of the teeth --,but because I've set the functions to show me metal,and make everything else transparent.,Here's another violent case. This really didn't kill the person.,The person was killed by stabs in the heart,,but they just deposited the knife,by putting it through one of the eyeballs.,Here's another case.,It's very interesting for us,to be able to look at things like knife stabbings.,Here you can see that knife went through the heart.,It's very easy to see how air has been leaking,from one part to another part,,which is difficult to do in a normal, standard, physical autopsy.,So it really, really helps,the criminal investigation,to establish the cause of death,,and in some cases also directing the investigation in the right direction,to find out who the killer really was. 
 Here's another case that I think is interesting.,Here you can see a bullet,that has lodged just next to the spine on this person.,And what we've done is that we've turned the bullet into a light source,,so that bullet is actually shining,,and it makes it really easy to find these fragments.,During a physical autopsy,,if you actually have to dig through the body to find these fragments,,that's actually quite hard to do. 
 One of the things that I'm really, really happy,to be able to show you here today,is our virtual autopsy table.,It's a touch device that we have developed,based on these algorithms, using standard graphics GPUs.,It actually looks like this,,just to give you a feeling for what it looks like.,It really just works like a huge iPhone.,So we've implemented,all the gestures you can do on the table,,and you can think of it as an enormous touch interface.,So if you were thinking of buying an iPad,,forget about it. This is what you want instead.,Steve, I hope you're listening to this, all right.,So it's a very nice little device.,So if you have the opportunity, please try it out.,It's really a hands-on experience.,So it gained some traction, and we're trying to roll this out,and trying to use it for educational purposes,,but also, perhaps in the future,,in a more clinical situation.,There's a YouTube video that you can download and look at this,,if you want to convey the information to other people,about virtual autopsies. 
 Okay, now that we're talking about touch,,let me move on to really "touching" data.,And this is a bit of science fiction now,,so we're moving into really the future.,This is not really what the medical doctors are using right now,,but I hope they will in the future.,So what you're seeing on the left is a touch device.,It's a little mechanical pen,that has very, very fast step motors inside of the pen.,And so I can generate a force feedback.,So when I virtually touch data,,it will generate forces in the pen, so I get a feedback.,So in this particular situation,,it's a scan of a living person.,I have this pen, and I look at the data,,and I move the pen towards the head,,and all of a sudden I feel resistance.,So I can feel the skin.,If I push a little bit harder, I'll go through the skin,,and I can feel the bone structure inside.,If I push even harder, I'll go through the bone structure,,especially close to the ear where the bone is very soft.,And then I can feel the brain inside, and this will be the slushy like this. 
 So this is really nice.,And to take that even further, this is a heart.,And this is also due to these fantastic new scanners,,that just in 0.3 seconds,,I can scan the whole heart,,and I can do that with time resolution.,So just looking at this heart,,I can play back a video here.,And this is Karljohan, one of my graduate students,who's been working on this project.,And he's sitting there in front of the Haptic device, the force feedback system,,and he's moving his pen towards the heart,,and the heart is now beating in front of him,,so he can see how the heart is beating.,He's taken the pen, and he's moving it towards the heart,,and he's putting it on the heart,,and then he feels the heartbeats from the real living patient.,Then he can examine how the heart is moving.,He can go inside, push inside of the heart,,and really feel how the valves are moving.,And this, I think, is really the future for heart surgeons.,I mean it's probably the wet dream for a heart surgeon,to be able to go inside of the patient's heart,before you actually do surgery,,and do that with high-quality resolution data.,So this is really neat. 
 Now we're going even further into science fiction.,And we heard a little bit about functional MRI.,Now this is really an interesting project.,MRI is using magnetic fields,and radio frequencies,to scan the brain, or any part of the body.,So what we're really getting out of this,is information of the structure of the brain,,but we can also measure the difference,in magnetic properties of blood that's oxygenated,and blood that's depleted of oxygen.,That means that it's possible,to map out the activity of the brain.,So this is something that we've been working on.,And you just saw Motts the research engineer, there,,going into the MRI system,,and he was wearing goggles.,So he could actually see things in the goggles.,So I could present things to him while he's in the scanner.,And this is a little bit freaky,,because what Motts is seeing is actually this.,He's seeing his own brain.,So Motts is doing something here,,and probably he is going like this with his right hand,,because the left side is activated,on the motor cortex.,And then he can see that at the same time.,These visualizations are brand new.,And this is something that we've been researching for a little while. 
 This is another sequence of Motts' brain.,And here we asked Motts to calculate backwards from 100.,So he's going "100, 97, 94.",And then he's going backwards.,And you can see how the little math processor is working up here in his brain,and is lighting up the whole brain.,Well this is fantastic. We can do this in real time.,We can investigate things. We can tell him to do things.,You can also see that his visual cortex,is activated in the back of the head,,because that's where he's seeing, he's seeing his own brain.,And he's also hearing our instructions,when we tell him to do things.,The signal is really deep inside of the brain as well,,and it's shining through,,because all of the data is inside this volume.,And in just a second here you will see --,okay, here. Motts, now move your left foot.,So he's going like this.,For 20 seconds he's going like that,,and all of a sudden it lights up up here.,So we've got motor cortex activation up there.,So this is really, really nice,,and I think this is a great tool.,And connecting also with the previous talk here,,this is something that we could use as a tool,to really understand,how the neurons are working, how the brain is working,,and we can do this with very, very high visual quality,and very fast resolution. 
 Now we're also having a bit of fun at the center.,So this is a CAT scan -- Computer Aided Tomography.,So this is a lion from the local zoo,outside of Norrkoping in Kolmarden, Elsa.,So she came to the center,,and they sedated her,and then put her straight into the scanner.,And then, of course, I get the whole data set from the lion.,And I can do very nice images like this.,I can peel off the layer of the lion.,I can look inside of it.,And we've been experimenting with this.,And I think this is a great application,for the future of this technology,,because there's very little known about the animal anatomy.,What's known out there for veterinarians is kind of basic information.,We can scan all sorts of things,,all sorts of animals.,The only problem is to fit it into the machine.,So here's a bear.,It was kind of hard to get it in.,And the bear is a cuddly, friendly animal.,And here it is. Here is the nose of the bear.,And you might want to cuddle this one,,until you change the functions and look at this.,So be aware of the bear. 
 So with that,,I'd like to thank all the people,who have helped me to generate these images.,It's a huge effort that goes into doing this,,gathering the data and developing the algorithms,,writing all the software.,So, some very talented people.,My motto is always, I only hire people that are smarter than I am,and most of these are smarter than I am. 
 So thank you very much. 
 (Applause)There was a time in my life,when everything seemed perfect.,Everywhere I went, I felt at home.,Everyone I met,,I felt I knew them for as long as I could remember.,And I want to share with you how I came to that place,and what I've learned since I left it. 
 This is where it began.,And it raises an existential question,,which is, if I'm having this experience of complete connection and full consciousness,,why am I not visible in the photograph,,and where is this time and place?,This is Los Angeles, California, where I live.,This is a police photo. That's actually my car.,We're less than a mile from one of the largest hospitals in Los Angeles,,called Cedars-Sinai.,And the situation is that a car full of paramedics,on their way home from the hospital after work,have run across the wreckage,,and they've advised the police,that there were no survivors inside the car,,that the driver's dead, that I'm dead.,And the police are waiting for the fire department to arrive,to cut apart the vehicle,to extract the body of the driver.,And when they do, they find that behind the glass,,they find me.,And my skull's crushed and my collar bone is crushed;,all but two of my ribs,,my pelvis and both arms --,they're all crushed, but there is still a pulse.,And they get me to that nearby hospital,,Cedars-Sinai,,where that night I receive, because of my internal bleeding,,45 units of blood --,which means full replacements of all the blood in me --,before they're able to staunch the flow.,I'm put on full life support,,and I have a massive stroke,,and my brain drops into a coma. 
 Now comas are measured,on a scale from 15 down to three.,Fifteen is a mild coma. Three is the deepest.,And if you look, you'll see that there's only one way you can score three.,It's essentially there's no sign of life,from outside at all.,I spent more than a month in a Glasgow Coma Scale three,,and it is inside that deepest level of coma,,on the rim between my life and my death,,that I'm experiencing the full connection and full consciousness,of inner space. 
 From my family looking in from outside,,what they're trying to figure out,is a different kind of existential question,,which is, how far is it going to be possible to bridge,from the comatose potential mind that they're looking at,to an actual mind,,which I define simply,as the functioning of the brain,that is remaining inside my head.,Now to put this into a broader context,,I want you to imagine that you are an eternal alien,watching the Earth from outer space,,and your favorite show on intergalactic satellite television,is the Earth channel,,and your favorite show is the Human Show.,And the reason I think it would be so interesting to you,is because consciousness is so interesting.,It's so unpredictable,and so fragile. 
 And this is how we began.,We all began in the Awash Valley in Ethiopia.,The show began with tremendous special effects,,because there were catastrophic climate shifts --,which sort of sounds interesting as a parallel to today.,Because of the Earth tilting on its axis,and those catastrophic climate shifts,,we had to figure out how to find better food,,and we had to learn -- there's Lucy; that's how we all began --,we had to learn how to crack open animal bones,,use tools to do that, to feed on the marrow,,to grow our brains more.,So we actually grew our consciousness,in response to this global threat. 
 Now you also continue to watch,as consciousness evolved to the point,that here in India, in Madhya Pradesh,,there's one of the two oldest known pieces of rock art found.,It's a cupule that took 40 to 50,000 blows with a stone tool to create,,and it's the first known expression of art,on the planet.,And the reason it connects us with consciousness today,is that all of us still today,,the very first shape we draw as a child,is a circle.,And then the next thing we do is we put a dot in the center of the circle.,We create an eye --,and the eye that evolves through all of our history.,There's the Egyptian god Horus,,which symbolizes prosperity, wisdom and health.,And that comes down right way to the present,with the dollar bill in the United States,,which has on it an eye of providence. 
 So watching all of this show from outer space,,you think we get it, we understand,that the most precious resource on the blue planet,is our consciousness.,Because it's the first thing we draw;,we surround ourselves with images of it;,it's probably the most common image on the planet.,But we don't. We take our consciousness for granted.,While I was producing in Los Angeles, I never thought about it for a second.,Until it was stripped from me, I never thought about it.,And what I've learned since that event,and during my recovery,is that consciousness is under threat on this planet,in ways it's never been under threat before.,These are just some examples. 
 And the reason I'm so honored to be here,to talk today in India,is because India has the sad distinction,of being the head injury capital of the world.,That statistic is so sad.,There is no more drastic and sudden gap created,between potential and actual mind,than a severe head injury.,Each one can entail up to a decade of rehabilitation,,which means that India, unless something changes,,is accumulating a need,for millennia of rehabilitation.,What you find in the United States,is an injury every 20 seconds -- that's one and a half million every year --,stroke every 40 seconds,,Alzheimer's disease, every 70 seconds somebody succumbs to that.,All of these represent gaps,between potential mind and actual mind. 
 And here are some of the other categories, if you look at the whole planet.,The World Health Organization tells us,that depression is the number one disease on Earth,in terms of years lived with disability.,We find that the number two source of disability,is depression in the age group,of 15 to 44.,Our children are becoming depressed,at an alarming rate.,I discovered during my recovery,the third leading cause of death amongst teenagers,is suicide.,If you look at some of these other items -- concussions.,Half of E.R. admissions from adolescents,are for concussions.,If I talk about migraine,,40 percent of the population,suffer episodic headaches.,Fifteen percent suffer migraines,that wipe them out for days on end. 
 All of this is leading -- computer addiction,,just to cover that: the most frequent thing we do,is use digital devices.,The average teenager,sends 3,300 texts every [month].,We're talking about a society that is retreating,into depression and disassociation,when we are potentially confronting,the next great catastrophic climate shift.,So what you'd be wondering, watching the Human Show,,is are we going to confront and address,the catastrophic climate shift that may be heading our way,by growing our consciousness,,or are we going to continue to retreat? 
 And that then might lead you,to watch an episode one day,of Cedars-Sinai medical center,and a consideration of the difference between potential mind and actual mind.,This is a dense array EEG MRI,tracking 156 channels of information.,It's not my EEG at Cedars;,it's your EEG tonight and last night.,It's the what our minds do every night,to digest the day,and to prepare to bridge from the potential mind when we're asleep,to the actual mind when we awaken the following morning.,This is how I was when I returned from the hospital,after nearly four months.,The horseshoe shape you can see on my skull,is where they operated and went inside my brain,to do the surgeries they needed to do to rescue my life.,But if you look into the eye of consciousness, that single eye you can see,,I'm looking down,,but let me tell you how I felt at that point.,I didn't feel empty; I felt everything simultaneously.,I felt empty and full, hot and cold,,euphoric and depressed,because the brain is the world's first,fully functional quantum computer;,it can occupy multiple states at the same time.,And with all the internal regulators of my brain damaged,,I felt everything simultaneously. 
 But let's swivel around and look at me frontally.,This is now flash-forward to the point in time,where I've been discharged by the health system.,Look into those eyes. I'm not able to focus those eyes.,I'm not able to follow a line of text in a book.,But the system has moved me on,because, as my family started to discover,,there is no long-term concept,in the health care system.,Neurological damage, 10 years of rehab,,requires a long-term perspective. 
 But let's take a look behind my eyes.,This is a gamma radiation spec scan,that uses gamma radiation,to map three-dimensional function within the brain.,It requires a laboratory to see it in three dimension,,but in two dimensions I think you can see,the beautiful symmetry and illumination,of a normal mind at work.,Here's my brain.,That is the consequence of more than a third of the right side of my brain,being destroyed by the stroke.,So my family, as we moved forward,and discovered that the health care system had moved us by,,had to try to find solutions and answers.,And during that process -- it took many years --,one of the doctors said that my recovery, my degree of advance,,since the amount of head injury I'd suffered,,was miraculous.,And that was when I started to write a book,,because I didn't think it was miraculous.,I thought there were miraculous elements,,but I also didn't think it was right,that one should have to struggle and search for answers,when this is a pandemic within our society. 
 So from this experience of my recovery,,I want to share four particular aspects --,I call them the four C's of consciousness --,that helped me grow my potential mind,back towards the actual mind that I work with every day.,The first C is cognitive training.,Unlike the smashed glass of my car,,plasticity of the brain,means that there was always a possibility, with treatment,,to train the brain,so that you can regain and raise your level of awareness and consciousness.,Plasticity means that there was always,hope for our reason --,hope for our ability to rebuild that function.,Indeed, the mind can redefine itself,,and this is demonstrated by two specialists called Hagen and Silva,back in the 1970's.,The global perspective,is that up to 30 percent of children in school,have learning weaknesses,that are not self-correcting,,but with appropriate treatment,,they can be screened for and detected and corrected,and avoid their academic failure.,But what I discovered is it's almost impossible to find anyone,who provides that treatment or care. 
 Here's what my neuropsychologist provided for me,when I actually found somebody who could apply it.,I'm not a doctor, so I'm not going to talk about the various subtests.,Let's just talk about full-scale I.Q.,Full-scale I.Q. is the mental processing --,how fast you can acquire information,,retain it and retrieve it --,that is essential for success in life today.,And you can see here there are three columns.,Untestable -- that's when I'm in my coma.,And then I creep up to the point that I get a score of 79,,which is just below average.,In the health care system, if you touch average, you're done.,That's when I was discharged from the system.,What does average I.Q. really mean?,It meant that when I was given two and a half hours,to take a test that anyone here,would take in 50 minutes,,I might score an F.,This is a very, very low level,in order to be kicked out of the health care system.,Then I underwent cognitive training.,And let me show you what happened to the right-hand column,when I did my cognitive training over a period of time.,This is not supposed to occur.,I.Q. is supposed to stabilize and solidify,at the age of eight. 
 Now the Journal of the National Medical Association,gave my memoir a full clinical review,,which is very unusual.,I'm not a doctor. I have no medical background whatsoever.,But they felt the evidences,that there was important, valuable information in the book,,and they commented about it when they gave the full peer review to it.,But they asked one question. They said, "Is this repeatable?",That was a fair question,because my memoir was simply how I found solutions that worked for me. 
 The answer is yes, and for the first time,,it's my pleasure to be able to share two examples.,Here's somebody, what they did as they went through cognitive training,at ages seven and 11.,And here's another person in, call it, high school and college.,And this person is particularly interesting.,I won't go into the intrascatter that's in the subtests,,but they still had a neurologic issue.,But that person could be identified,as having a learning disability.,And with accommodation, they went on to college,and had a full life in terms of their opportunities. 
 Second aspect:,I still had crushing migraine headaches.,Two elements that worked for me here,are -- the first is 90 percent, I learned, of head and neck pain,is through muscular-skeletal imbalance.,The craniomandibular system is critical to that.,And when I underwent it and found solutions,,this is the interrelationship between the TMJ and the teeth.,Up to 30 percent of the population,have a disorder, disease or dysfunction in the jaw,that affects the entire body.,I was fortunate to find a dentist,who applied this entire universe,of technology you're about to see,to establish that if he repositioned my jaw,,the headaches pretty much resolved,,but that then my teeth weren't in the right place.,He then held my jaw in the right position,while orthodontically he put my teeth into correct alignment.,So my teeth actually hold my jaw in the correct position.,This affected my entire body. 
 If that sounds like a very, very strange thing to say,and rather a bold statement --,How can the jaw affect the entire body? --,let me simply point out to you,,if I ask you tomorrow,to put one grain of sand between your teeth,and go for a nice long walk,,how far would you last,before you had to remove that grain of sand?,That tiny misalignment.,Bear in mind, there are no nerves in the teeth.,That's why the same between the before and after that this shows,,it's hard to see the difference.,Now just trying putting a few grains of sand between your teeth,and see the difference it makes.,I still had migraine headaches. 
 The next issue that resolved,was that, if 90 percent of head and neck pain,is caused by imbalance,,the other 10 percent, largely --,if you set aside aneurysms, brain cancer,and hormonal issues --,is the circulation.,Imagine the blood flowing through your body --,I was told at UCLA Medical Center --,as one sealed system.,There's a big pipe with the blood flowing through it,,and around that pipe are the nerves,drawing their nutrient supply from the blood.,That's basically it.,If you press on a hose pipe in a sealed system,,it bulges someplace else.,If that some place else where it bulges,is inside the biggest nerve in your body, your brain,,you get a vascular migraine.,This is a level of pain that's only known,to other people who suffer vascular migraines.,Using this technology,,this is mapping in three dimensions.,This is an MRI MRA MRV,,a volumetric MRI.,Using this technology, the specialists at UCLA Medical Center,were able to identify,where that compression in the hose pipe was occurring.,A vascular surgeon removed most of the first rib on both sides of my body.,And in the following months and years,,I felt the neurological flow of life itself returning. 
 Communication, the next C. This is critical.,All consciousness is about communication.,And here, by great fortune,,one of my father's clients,had a husband who worked,at the Alfred Mann Foundation for Scientific Research.,Alfred Mann is a brilliant physicist and innovator,who's fascinated with bridging gaps in consciousness,,whether to restore hearing to the deaf, vision to the blind,or movement to the paralyzed.,And I'm just going to give you an example today,of movement to the paralyzed.,I've brought with me, from Southern California,,the FM device.,This is it being held in the hand.,It weighs less than a gram.,So two of them implanted in the body would weigh less than a dime.,Five of them would still weigh less,than a rupee coin. 
 Where does it go inside the body?,It has been simulated and tested to endure in the body corrosion-free,for over 80 years.,So it goes in and it stays there.,Here are the implantation sites.,The concept that they're working towards -- and they have working prototypes --,is that we placed it throughout the motor points of the body,where they're needed.,The main unit will then go inside the brain.,An FM device in the cortex of the brain, the motor cortex,,will send signals in real time,to the motor points in the relevant muscles,so that the person will be able to move their arm, let's say, in real time,,if they've lost control of their arm.,And other FM devices implanted in fingertips,,on contacting a surface,,will send a message back to the sensory cortex of the brain,,so that the person feels a sense of touch.,Is this science fiction? No,,because I'm wearing the first application of this technology.,I don't have the ability to control my left foot.,A radio device is controlling every step I take,,and a sensor picks up my foot for me,every time I walk. 
 And in closing, I want to share,the personal reason why this meant so much to me,and changed the direction of my life.,In my coma, one of the presences I sensed,was someone I felt was a protector.,And when I came out of my coma, I recognized my family,,but I didn't remember my own past.,Gradually, I remembered the protector was my wife.,And I whispered the good news,through my broken jaw, which was wired shut,,to my night nurse.,And the following morning, my mother came to explain,that I'd not always been in this bed, in this room,,that I'd been working in film and television,and that I had been in a crash,and that, yes, I was married,,but Marcy had been killed instantly in the crash.,And during my time in coma,,she had been laid to rest in her hometown of Phoenix.,Now in the dark years that followed, I had to work out what remained for me,if everything that made today special was gone.,And as I discovered these threats to consciousness,and how they are surrounding the world,and enveloping the lives of more and more people every day,,I discovered what truly remained.,I believe that we can overcome the threats to our consciousness,,that the Human Show can stay on the air,for millennia to come.,I believe that we can all rise and shine. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Lakshmi Pratury: Just stay for a second. Just stay here for a second. 
 (Applause) 
 You know,,when I heard Simon's --,please sit down; I just want to talk to him for a second --,when I read his book, I went to LA to meet him.,And so I was sitting in this restaurant,,waiting for a man to come by,who obviously would have some difficulty ...,I don't know what I had in my mind.,And he was walking around.,I didn't expect that person that I was going to meet,to be him.,And then we met and we talked,,and I'm like, he doesn't look,like somebody who was built out of nothing.,And then I was amazed,at what role technology played,in your recovery.,And we have his book outside,in the bookshop.,The thing that amazed me,is the painstaking detail,with which he has written,every hospital he has been to,,every treatment he got,,every near-miss he had,,and how accidentally he stumbled upon innovations.,So I think this one detail,went past people really quick.,Tell a little bit about what you're wearing on your leg. 
 Simon Lewis: I knew when I was timing this,that there wouldn't be time for me to do anything about --,Well this is it. This is the control unit.,And this records every single step I've taken,for, ooh, five or six years now.,And if I do this, probably the mic won't hear it.,That little chirp followed by two chirps is now switched on.,When I press it again, it'll chirp three times,,and that'll mean that it's armed and ready to go.,And that's my friend. I mean, I charge it every night.,And it works. It works.,And what I would love to add because I didn't have time ... 
 What does it do? Well actually, I'll show you down here.,This down here, if the camera can see that,,that is a small antenna.,Underneath my heel, there is a sensor,that detects when my foot leaves the ground --,what's called the heel lift.,This thing blinks all the time; I'll leave it out, so you might be able to see it.,But this is blinking all the time. It's sending signals in real time.,And if you walk faster, if I walk faster,,it detects what's called the time interval,,which is the interval between each heel lift.,And it accelerates the amount and level of the stimulation.,The other things they've worked on -- I didn't have time to say this in my talk --,is they've restored functional hearing,to thousands of deaf people. 
 I could tell you the story: this was going to be an abandoned technology,,but Alfred Mann met the doctor who was going to retire,,[Dr. Schindler.],And he was going to retire -- all the technology was going to be lost,,because not a single medical manufacturer would take it on,because it was a small issue.,But there's millions of deaf people in the world,,and the Cochlear implant has given hearing to thousands of deaf people now.,It works.,And the other thing is they're working on artificial retinas for the blind.,And this, this is the implantable generation.,Because what I didn't say in my talk,is this is actually exoskeletal.,I should clarify that.,Because the first generation is exoskeletal,,it's wrapped around the leg,,around the affected limb.,I must tell you, they're an amazing --,there's a hundred people who work in that building --,engineers, scientists,,and other team members -- all the time. 
 Alfred Mann has set up this foundation,to advance this research,because he saw,there's no way venture capital would come in for something like this.,The audience is too small.,You'd think, there's plenty of paralyzed people in the world,,but the audience is too small,,and the amount of research, the time it takes,,the FDA clearances,,the payback time is too long,for V.C. to be interested.,So he saw a need and he stepped in.,He's a very, very remarkable man.,He's done a lot of very cutting-edge science. 
 LP: So when you get a chance, spend some time with Simon.,Thank you. Thank you. 
 (Applause)I was offered a positionnas associate professor of medicine,and chief of scientific visualization,at Yale University,in the department of medicine.,And my job was to writenmany of the algorithms and code,for NASA to do virtual surgery,in preparation for the astronautsngoing into deep-space flight,,so they could be kept in robotic pods.,One of the fascinating thingsnabout what we were working on,is that we were seeing,nusing new scanning technologies,,things that had never been seen before.,Not only in disease management,,but also things that allowed usnto see things about the body,that just made you marvel. 
 I remember one of the first timesnwe were looking at collagen.,And your entire body, everything --,your hair, skin, bone, nails --,everything is made of collagen.,And it's a kind of rope-like structurenthat twirls and swirls like this.,And the only place that collagennchanges its structure,is in the cornea of your eye.,In your eye,nit becomes a grid formation,,and therefore, it becomesntransparent, as opposed to opaque.,So perfectly organized a structure,,it was hard not to attributendivinity to it.,Because we kept on seeing thisnin different parts of the body. 
 One of the opportunities I had,was one person was workingnon a really interesting,micromagnetic resonancenimaging machine with the NIH.,And what we were going to do,was scan a new project,on the development of the fetusnfrom conception to birth,using these new technologies.,So I wrote the algorithms and code,,and he built the hardware --nPaul Lauterbur --,then went onto win the NobelnPrize for inventing the MRI.,I got the data.,And I'm going to show youna sample of the piece,,"From Conception to Birth."

 Alexander Tsiaras: Thank you.,But as you can see,,when you actually startnworking on this data,,it's pretty spectacular.,And as we kept on scanning more and more,,working on this project,,looking at these two simple cells,that have this unbelievable machinerynthat will become the magic of you.,And as we kept on working on this data,,looking at small clusters of the body,,these little pieces of tissue,that were the trophoblastsncoming off of the blastocyst,,all of a sudden burrowing itselfninto the side of the uterus,,saying, "I'm here to stay.",Having conversation and communications,with the estrogens, the progesterones,,saying, "I'm here to stay, plant me,",building this incredible trilinear fetus,that becomes, within 44 days,nsomething that you can recognize,,and then at nine weeksnis really kind of a little human being.,The marvel of this information:,How do we actually haventhis biological mechanism,inside our body,to actually see this information? 
 I'm going to show younsomething pretty unique.,Here's a human heart at 25 days.,It's just basically two strands.,And like this magnificent origami,,cells are developing at one million cellsnper second at four weeks,,as it's just folding on itself.,Within five weeks, you start to seenthe early atrium and the early ventricles.,Six weeks, these folds are now beginning,with the papillanon the inside of the heart,actually being able to pull downneach one of those valves in your heart,until you get a mature heart --,and then basically the developmentnof the entire human body.,The magic of the mechanismsninside each genetic structure,saying exactly wherenthat nerve cell should go --,the complexity of these,,the mathematical modelsnof how these things are indeed done,are beyond human comprehension. 
 Even though I am a mathematician,,I look at this with marvel,of how do these instruction setsnnot make these mistakes,as they build what is us?,It's a mystery, it's magic, it's divinity.,Then you start to takena look at adult life.,Take a look at thisnlittle tuft of capillaries.,It's just a tinynsub-substructure, microscopic.,But basically by the time you'rennine months and you're given birth,,you have almost 60,000 milesnof vessels inside your body.,And only one mile is visible.,59,999 miles,that are basically bringingnnutrients and taking waste away.,The complexity of buildingnthat within a single system,is, again, beyond any comprehensionnor any existing mathematics today. 
 And then instructions set,,from the brain to every othernpart of the body --,look at the complexity of the folding.,Where does this intelligence,of knowing that a fold cannactually hold more information,,so as you actually watchnthe baby's brain grow.,And this is one of the things we're doing.,We're launching two new studies,of scanning babies' brainsnfrom the moment they're born.,Every six monthsnuntil they're six years old,,we're going to be doingnabout 250 children,,watching exactly how the gyrinand the sulci of the brains fold,to see how this magnificent development,actually turns into memoriesnand the marvel that is us. 
 And it's not just our own existence,,but how does the woman's body understand,to have genetic structurenthat not only builds her own,,but then has the understanding,that allows her to become,a walking immunological,ncardiovascular system,that basically is a mobile system,that can actually nurture,,treat this child with a kind of marvel,that is beyond, again,nour comprehension --,the magic that is existence, that is us? 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Both myself and my brother,belong to the under 30 demographic,,which Pat said makes 70 percent,,but according to our statistics,it makes 60 percent of the region's population.,Qatar is no exception to the region.,It's a very young nation led by young people.,We have been reminiscing about the latest technologies,and the iPods,,and for me the abaya,,my traditional dress that I'm wearing today. 
 Now this is not a religious garment,,nor is it a religious statement.,Instead, it's a diverse cultural statement,that we choose to wear.,Now I remember a few years ago,,a journalist asked Dr. Sheikha, who's sitting here,,president of Qatar University --,who, by the way, is a woman --,he asked her whether she thought,the abaya hindered or infringed her freedom in any way.,Her answer was quite the contrary.,Instead, she felt more free,,more free because she could wear whatever she wanted,under the abaya.,She could come to work in her pajamas and nobody would care.,(Laughter),Not that you do; I'm just saying. 
 (Laughter) 
 My point is here, people have a choice --,just like the Indian lady could wear her sari,or the Japanese woman could wear her kimono.,We are changing our culture from within,,but at the same time,we are reconnecting with our traditions.,We know that modernization is happening.,And yes, Qatar wants to be a modern nation.,But at the same time,we are reconnecting and reasserting our Arab heritage.,It's important for us to grow organically.,And we continuously make the conscious decision,to reach that balance. 
 In fact, research has shown,that the more the world is flat,,if I use Tom Friedman's analogy,,or global,,the more and more people are wanting to be different.,And for us young people,,they're looking to become individuals,and find their differences amongst themselves.,Which is why I prefer the Richard Wilk analogy,of globalizing the local,and localizing the global.,We don't want to be all the same,,but we want to respect each other and understand each other.,And therefore tradition becomes more important,,not less important. 
 Life necessitates a universal world,,however, we believe in the security,of having a local identity.,And this is what the leaders of this region,are trying to do.,We're trying to be part of this global village,,but at the same time we're revising ourselves,through our cultural institutions and cultural development.,I'm a representation of that phenomenon.,And I think a lot of people in this room,,I can see a lot of you are in the same position as myself.,And I'm sure, although we can't see the people in Washington,,they are in the same position.,We're continuously trying to straddle,different worlds, different cultures,and trying to meet the challenges,of a different expectation,from ourselves and from others. 
 So I want to ask a question:,What should culture in the 21st century look like?,In a time where the world is becoming personalized,,when the mobile phone, the burger, the telephone,,everything has its own personal identity,,how should we perceive ourselves,and how should we perceive others?,How does that impact our desert culture? 
 I'm not sure of how many of you in Washington,are aware of the cultural developments happening in the region,and, the more recent, Museum of Islamic Art,opened in Qatar in 2008.,I myself am personalizing these cultural developments,,but I also understand,that this has to be done organically.,Yes, we do have all the resources that we need,in order to develop new cultural institutions,,but what I think is more important,is that we are very fortunate,to have visionary leaders,who understand that this can't happen from outside,,it has to come from within.,And guess what?,You might be surprised to know that most people in the Gulf,who are leading these cultural initiatives,happen to be women. 
 I want to ask you, why do you think this is?,Is it because it's a soft option;,we have nothing else to do?,No, I don't think so.,I think that women in this part of the world,realize that culture is an important component,to connect people,both locally and regionally.,It's a natural component,for bringing people together, discussing ideas --,in the same way we're doing here at TED.,We're here, we're part of a community,,sharing out ideas and discussing them.,Art becomes a very important part,of our national identity.,The existential and social and political impact,an artist has,on his nation's development of cultural identity,is very important. 
 You know, art and culture is big business.,Ask me.,Ask the chairpersons and CEOs,of Sotheby's and Christie's.,Ask Charles Saatchi about great art.,They make a lot of money.,So I think women in our society,are becoming leaders,,because they realize,that for their future generations,,it's very important,to maintain our cultural identities.,Why else do Greeks demand the return,of the Elgin Marbles?,And why is there an uproar,when a private collector tries to sell his collection,to a foreign museum?,Why does it take me months on end,to get an export license from London or New York,in order to get pieces into my country? 
 In few hours, Shirin Neshat, my friend from Iran,who's a very important artist for us,will be talking to you.,She lives in New York City, but she doesn't try to be a Western artist.,Instead, she tries to engage,in a very important dialogue,about her culture, nation and heritage.,She does that through important visual forms,of photography and film. 
 In the same way, Qatar is trying to grow its national museums,through an organic process from within.,Our mission is of cultural integration and independence.,We don't want to have what there is in the West.,We don't want their collections.,We want to build our own identities, our own fabric,,create an open dialogue,so that we share our ideas,and share yours with us.,In a few days,,we will be opening the Arab Museum of Modern Art.,We have done extensive research,to ensure that Arab and Muslim artists,,and Arabs who are not Muslims --,not all Arabs are Muslims, by the way --,but we make sure that they are represented,in this new institution.,This institution is government-backed,and it has been the case,for the past three decades.,We will open the museum in a few days,,and I welcome all of you to get on Qatar Airways,and come and join us. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now this museum is just as important to us as the West.,Some of you might have heard,of the Algerian artist Baya Mahieddine,,but I doubt a lot of people know,that this artist worked in Picasso's studio,in Paris in the 1930s.,For me it was a new discovery.,And I think with time, in the years to come,we'll be learning a lot about our Picassos,,our Legers and our Cezannes.,We do have artists,,but unfortunately we have not discovered them yet. 
 Now visual expression is just one form,of culture integration.,We have realized that recently,more and more people,are using the means of YouTube and social networking,to express their stories, share their photos,and tell their own stories through their own voices.,In a similar way,,we have created the Doha Film Institute.,Now the Doha Film Institute is an organization,to teach people about film and filmmaking.,Last year we didn't have one Qatari woman filmmaker.,Today I am proud to say,we have trained and educated,over 66 Qatari women filmmakers,to edit, tell their own stories,in their own voices. 
 (Applause) 
 Now if you'll allow me, I would love to share a one-minute film,that has proven to show,that a 60-sec film can be as powerful as a haiku,in telling a big picture.,And this is one of our filmmakers' products.

Here, put on the headscarf.,Khaled: Why would I want to put it on?,Girl: Do as you're told, young girl.,Boy: No, you play mom and I play dad.

 (Applause) 
 SM: Going back to straddling between East and West,,last month we had our second Doha Tribeca Film Festival,here in Doha.,The Doha Tribeca Film Festival,was held at our new cultural hub, Katara.,It attracted 42,000 people,,and we showcased 51 films.,Now the Doha Tribeca Film Festival,is not an imported festival,,but rather an important festival,between the cities of New York and Doha.,It's important for two things.,First, it allows us to showcase,our Arab filmmakers and voices,to one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world,,New York City.,At the same time, we are inviting them,to come and explore our part of the world.,They're learning our culture, our language, our heritage,and realizing we're just as different,and just the same as each other. 
 Now over and over again,,people have said, "Let's build bridges,",and frankly, I want to do more than that.,I would like break the walls of ignorance,between East and West --,no, not the soft option that we have discussed before,,but rather the soft power,that Joseph Nye has spoken about before.,Culture's a very important tool to bring people together.,We should not underestimate it. 
 "Know thyself,",that is the journey of self-expression and self-realization,that we are traveling.,Now I don't pretend to have all the answers,,but I know that me as an individual,and we as a nation,welcome this community,of ideas worth spreading.,This is a very interesting journey.,I welcome you on board,for us to engage and discuss new ideas,of how to bring people together,through cultural initiatives and discussions.,Familiarity destroys and trumps fear. Try it. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. Shokran. 
 (Applause)Penelope Jagessar Chaffer: I was going to ask if there's a doctor in the house.,No, I'm just joking.,It's interesting, because it was six years ago,when I was pregnant with my first child,that I discovered,that the most commonly used preservative,in baby care products,mimics estrogen,when it gets into the human body.,Now it's very easy actually,to get a chemical compound from products,into the human body through the skin.,And these preservatives had been found,in breast cancer tumors. 
 That was the start of my journey,to make this film, "Toxic Baby.",And it doesn't take much time,to discover some really astonishing statistics,with this issue.,One is that you and I all have,between 30 to 50,000 chemicals,in our bodies,that our grandparents didn't have.,And many of these chemicals,are now linked to the skyrocketing incidents,of chronic childhood disease,that we're seeing across industrialized nations.,I'll show you some statistics.,So for example, in the United Kingdom,,the incidence of childhood leukemia,has risen by 20 percent just in a generation.,Very similar statistic for childhood cancer in the U.S.,In Canada, we're now looking at one in 10 Canadian children with asthma.,That's a four-fold increase. 
 Again, similar story around the world.,In the United States,,probably the most astonishing statistic,is a 600 percent increase,in autism and autistic spectrum disorders,and other learning disabilities.,Again, we're seeing that trend,across Europe, across North America.,And in Europe,,there's certain parts of Europe,,where we're seeing a four-fold increase,in certain genital birth defects.,Interestingly, one of those birth defects,has seen a 200 percent increase in the U.S.,So a real skyrocketing,of chronic childhood disease,that includes other things,like obesity and juvenile diabetes,,premature puberty. 
 So it's interesting for me,,when I'm looking for someone who can really talk to me,and talk to an audience about these things,,that probably one of the most important people in the world,who can discuss toxicity in babies,is expert in frogs. 
 (Laughter) 
 Tyrone Hayes: It was a surprise to me as well,that I would be talking about pesticides,,that I'd be talking about public health,,because, in fact, I never thought I would do anything useful.,(Laughter),Frogs.,In fact, my involvement in the whole pesticide issue,was sort of a surprise as well,when I was approached by the largest chemical company in the world,and they asked me if I would evaluate,how atrazine affected amphibians, or my frogs.,It turns out, atrazine is the largest selling product,for the largest chemical company in the world.,It's the number one contaminant,of groundwater, drinking water, rain water.,In 2003, after my studies, it was banned in the European Union,,but in that same year,,the United States EPA re-registered the compound. 
 We were a bit surprised when we found out,that when we exposed frogs,to very low levels of atrazine -- 0.1 parts per billion --,that it produced animals that look like this.,These are the dissected gonads of an animal,that has two testes, two ovaries,,another large testis, more ovaries,,which is not normal ...,(Laughter),even for amphibians.,In some cases, another species like the North American Leopard Frog,showed that males exposed to atrazine grew eggs in their testes.,And you can see these large, yolked-up eggs,bursting through the surface of this male's testes.,Now my wife tells me, and I'm sure Penelope can as well,,that there's nothing more painful than childbirth --,which that I'll never experience, I can't really argue that --,but I would guess that a dozen chicken eggs in my testicle,would probably be somewhere in the top five. 
 (Laughter) 
 In recent studies that we've published,,we've shown that some of these animals when they're exposed to atrazine,,some of the males grow up,and completely become females.,So these are actually two brothers consummating a relationship.,And not only do these genetic males mate with other males,,they actually have the capacity to lay eggs,even though they're genetic males.,What we proposed,,and what we've now generated support for,,is that what atrazine is doing,is wreaking havoc causing a hormone imbalance.,Normally the testes should make testosterone,,the male hormone.,But what atrazine does is it turns on an enzyme,,the machinery if you will, aromatase,,that converts testosterone into estrogen.,And as a result, these exposed males,lose their testosterone, they're chemically castrated,,and they're subsequently feminized,because now they're making the female hormone. 
 Now this is what brought me to the human-related issues.,Because it turns out,that the number one cancer in women, breast cancer,,is regulated by estrogen and by this enzyme aromatase.,So when you develop a cancerous cell in your breast,,aromatase converts androgens into estrogens,,and that estrogen turns on or promotes,the growth of that cancer,so that it turns into a tumor and spreads.,In fact, this aromatase is so important in breast cancer,that the latest treatment for breast cancer,is a chemical called letrozole,,which blocks aromatase, blocks estrogen,,so that if you developed a mutated cell, it doesn't grow into a tumor. 
 Now what's interesting is, of course,,that we're still using 80 million pounds of atrazine,,the number one contaminant in drinking water, that does the opposite --,turns on aromatase, increases estrogen,and promotes tumors in rats,and is associated with tumors, breast cancer, in humans.,What's interesting is, in fact,,the same company that sold us 80 million pounds of atrazine,,the breast cancer promoter,,now sells us the blocker -- the exact same company.,And so I find it interesting,that instead of treating this disease,by preventing exposure to the chemicals that promote it,,we simply respond,by putting more chemicals into the environment. 
 PJC: So speaking of estrogen,,one of the other compounds that Tyrone talks about in the film,is something called bisphenol A, BPA,,which has been in the news recently.,It's a plasticizer.,It's a compound that's found in polycarbonate plastic,,which is what baby bottles are made out of.,And what's interesting about BPA,is that it's such a potent estrogen,that it was actually once considered for use,as a synthetic estrogen in hormone placement therapy.,And there have been many, many, many studies that have shown,that BPA leaches from babies' bottles,into the formula, into the milk,,and therefore into the babies.,So we're dosing our babies,,our newborns, our infants,,with a synthetic estrogen. 
 Now two weeks ago or so,,the European Union passed a law,banning the use of BPA,in babies' bottles and sippy cups.,And for those of you who are not parents,,sippy cups are those little plastic things,that your child graduates to after using bottles.,But just two weeks before that,,the U.S. Senate refused to even debate,the banning of BPA,in babies' bottles and sippy cups.,So it really makes you realize,the onus on parents,to have to look at this and regulate this and police this,in their own lives,and how astonishing that is. 
 (Video) PJC: With many plastic baby bottles,now proven to leak the chemical bisphenol A,,it really shows how sometimes,it is only a parent's awareness,that stands between chemicals and our children.,The baby bottle scenario proves,that we can prevent unnecessary exposure.,However, if we parents are unaware,,we are leaving our children,to fend for themselves. 
 TH: And what Penelope says here,is even more true.,For those of you who don't know, we're in the middle of the sixth mass extinction.,Scientists agree now.,We are losing species from the Earth,faster than the dinosaurs disappeared,,and leading that loss are amphibians.,80 percent of all amphibians,are threatened and in come decline.,And I believe, many scientists believe,that pesticides are an important part of that decline.,In part, amphibians are good indicators and more sensitive,because they don't have protection from contaminants in the water --,no eggshells, no membranes,and no placenta.,In fact, our invention -- by "our" I mean we mammals --,one of our big inventions was the placenta.,But we also start out as aquatic organisms. 
 But it turns out that this ancient structure,that separates us from other animals, the placenta,,cannot evolve or adapt fast enough,because of the rate that we're generating new chemicals,that it's never seen before.,The evidence of that is that studies in rats, again with atrazine,,show that the hormone imbalance atrazine generates causes abortion.,Because maintaining a pregnancy is dependent on hormones. 
 Of those rats that don't abort,,atrazine causes prostate disease,in the pups so the sons,are born with an old man's disease.,Of those that don't abort,,atrazine causes impaired mammary, or breast, development,in the exposed daughters in utero,,so that their breast don't develop properly.,And as a result, when those rats grow up,,their pups experience retarded growth and development,because they can't make enough milk to nourish their pups. 
 So the pup you see on the bottom is affected by atrazine,that its grandmother was exposed to.,And given the life of many of these chemicals,,generations, years, dozens of years,,that means that we right now,are affecting the health,of our grandchildren's grandchildren,by things that we're putting into the environment today. 
 And this is not just philosophical, it's already known,,that chemicals like diethylstilbestrol and estrogen,,PCBs, DDT,cross the placenta,and effectively determine,the likelihood of developing breast cancer,and obesity and diabetes,already when the baby's in the womb.,In addition to that, after the baby's born,,our other unique invention as mammals,is that we nourish our offspring after they're born.,We already know that chemicals,like DDT and DES and atrazine,can also pass over into milk,,again, affecting our babies,even after their born. 
 PJC: So when Tyrone tells me,that the placenta is an ancient organ,,I'm thinking, how do I demonstrate that?,How do you show that?,And it's interesting when you make a film like this,,because you're stuck trying to visualize science,that there's no visualization for.,And I have to take a little bit of artistic license. 
 (Video) (Ringing),Old man: Placenta control.,What is it?,Oh what?,(Snoring),(Honk),Puffuffuff, what?,Perflourooctanoic acid.,Blimey.,Never heard of it.,PJC: And neither had I actually,before I started making this film.,And so when you realize that chemicals can pass the placenta,and go into your unborn child,,it made me start to think,,what would my fetus say to me?,What would our unborn children say to us,when they have an exposure,that's happening everyday, day after day? 
 (Music) 
 (Video) Child: Today,,I had some octyphenols,,some artificial musks,and some bisphenol A.,Help me. 
 PJC: It's a very profound notion,to know that we as women,are at the vanguard of this.,This is our issue,,because we collect these compounds our entire life,and then we end up dumping it and dumping them,into our unborn children.,We are in effect,polluting our children.,And this was something that was really brought home to me a year ago,when I found out I was pregnant,and the first scan revealed,that my baby had a birth defect,associated with exposure,to estrogenic chemicals in the womb,and the second scan,revealed no heartbeat. 
 So my child's death, my baby's death,,really brought home the resonance of what I was trying to make in this film.,And it's sometimes a weird place,when the communicator becomes part of the story,,which is not what you originally intend.,And so when Tyrone talks about,the fetus being trapped in a contaminated environment,,this is my contaminated environment.,This is my toxic baby.,And that's something,that's just profound and sad,,but astonishing,because so many of us don't actually know this. 
 TH: One of this things that's exciting and appropriate,for me to be here at TEDWomen,is that, well, I think it was summed up best last night at dinner,when someone said, "Turn to the man at your table and tell them,,'When the revolution starts, we've got your back.'",The truth is, women,,you've had our back on this issue for a very long time,,starting with Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring",to Theo Colborn's "Our Stolen Future",to Sandra Steingraber's books,"Living Downstream" and "Having Faith.",And perhaps it's the connection to our next generation --,like my wife and my beautiful daughter here about 13 years ago --,perhaps it's that connection,that makes women activists,in this particular area. 
 But for the men here, I want to say,it's not just women and children that are at risk.,And the frogs that are exposed to atrazine,,the testes are full of holes and spaces,,because the hormone imbalance,,instead of allowing sperm to be generated,,such as in the testis here,,the testicular tubules end up empty,and fertility goes down by as much as 50 percent.,It's not just my work in amphibians,,but similar work has been shown in fish in Europe,,holes in the testes and absence of sperm in reptiles in a group from South America,and in rats, an absence of sperm,in the testicular tubules as well.,And of course, we don't do these experiments in humans,,but just by coincidence,,my colleague has shown,that men who have low sperm count, low semen quality,have significantly more atrazine in their urine. 
 These are just men who live,in an agricultural community.,Men who actually work in agriculture,have much higher levels of atrazine.,And the men who actually apply atrazine,have even more atrazine in their urine,,up to levels that are 24,000 times what we know to be active,are present in the urine of these men.,Of course, most of them, 90 percent are Mexican, Mexican-American.,And it's not just atrazine they're exposed to.,They're exposed to chemicals like chloropicrin,,which was originally used as a nerve gas.,And many of these workers,have life expectancies of only 50. 
 It shouldn't come to any surprise that the things that happen in wildlife,are also a warning to us,,just like Rachel Carson and others have warned.,As evident in this slide from Lake Nabugabo in Uganda,,the agricultural runoff from this crop,,which goes into these buckets,,is the sole source of drinking, cooking and bathing water for this village.,Now if I told the men in this village,that the frogs have pour immune function,and eggs developing in their testes,,the connection between environmental health and public health,would be clear.,You would not drink water that you knew was having this kind of impact,on the wildlife that lived in it.,The problem is, in my village, Oakland,,in most of our villages,,we don't see that connection.,We turn on the faucet, the water comes out, we assume it's safe,,and we assume that we are masters of our environment,,rather than being part of it. 
 PJC: So it doesn't take much to realize,that actually this is an environmental issue.,And I kept thinking over and over again,this question.,We know so much about global warming and climate change,,and yet, we have no concept,of what I've been calling internal environmentalism.,We know what we're putting out there,,we have a sense of those repercussions,,but we are so ignorant of this sense,of what happens when we put things, or things are put,into our bodies. 
 And it's my feeling,and it's my urging being here,to know that, as we women move forward,as the communicators of this,,but also as the ones who carry that burden,of carrying the children, bearing the children,,we hold most of the buying power in the household,,is that it's going to be us moving forward,to carry the work of Tyrone and other scientists around the world.,And my urging is,that when we think about environmental issues,that we remember that it's not just about melting glaciers and ice caps,,but it's also about our children as well. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Can any of you,remember what you wanted to be,when you were 17?,Do you know what I wanted to be?,I wanted to be a biker chick.,(Laughter),I wanted to race cars,,and I wanted to be a cowgirl,,and I wanted to be Mowgli from "The Jungle Book.",Because they were all about being free,,the wind in your hair -- just to be free.,And on my seventeenth birthday,,my parents, knowing how much I loved speed,,gave me one driving lesson,for my seventeenth birthday.,Not that we could have afforded I drive,,but to give me the dream of driving. 
 And on my seventeenth birthday,,I accompanied my little sister,in complete innocence,,as I always had all my life --,my visually impaired sister --,to go to see an eye specialist.,Because big sisters,are always supposed to support their little sisters.,And my little sister wanted to be a pilot --,God help her.,So I used to get my eyes tested,just for fun.,And on my seventeenth birthday,,after my fake eye exam,,the eye specialist just noticed it happened to be my birthday.,And he said, "So what are you going to do to celebrate?",And I took that driving lesson,,and I said, "I'm going to learn how to drive.",And then there was a silence --,one of those awful silences,when you know something's wrong.,And he turned to my mother,,and he said, "You haven't told her yet?",On my seventeenth birthday,,as Janis Ian would best say,,I learned the truth at 17.,I am, and have been since birth,,legally blind. 
 And you know,,how on earth did I get to 17,and not know that?,Well, if anybody says country music isn't powerful,,let me tell you this:,I got there,because my father's passion for Johnny Cash,and a song, "A Boy Named Sue.",I'm the eldest of three. I was born in 1971.,And very shortly after my birth,,my parents found out I had a condition called ocular albinism.,And what the hell does that mean to you?,So let me just tell you, the great part of all of this?,I can't see this clock and I can't see the timing,,so holy God, woohoo! (Laughter),I might buy some more time.,But more importantly, let me tell you --,I'm going to come up really close here. Don't freak out, Pat.,Hey.,See this hand?,Beyond this hand is a world of Vaseline.,Every man in this room, even you, Steve,,is George Clooney.,(Laughter),And every woman, you are so beautiful.,And when I want to look beautiful, I step three feet away from the mirror,,and I don't have to see these lines etched in my face,from all the squinting I've done all my life,from all the dark lights. 
 The really strange part is,that, at three and a half, just before I was going to school,,my parents made a bizarre, unusual,and incredibly brave decision.,No special needs schools.,No labels.,No limitations.,My ability and my potential.,And they decided to tell me,that I could see.,So just like Johnny Cash's Sue,,a boy given a girl's name,,I would grow up and learn from experience,how to be tough and how to survive,,when they were no longer there to protect me,,or just take it all away.,But more significantly,,they gave me the ability,to believe,,totally, to believe that I could.,And so when I heard that eye specialist,tell me all the things, a big fat "no,",everybody imagines I was devastated.,And don't get me wrong, because when I first heard it --,aside from the fact that I thought he was insane --,I got that thump in my chest,,just that "huh?",But very quickly I recovered. It was like that.,The first thing I thought about was my mom,,who was crying over beside me.,And I swear to God, I walked out of his office,,"I will drive. I will drive.,You're mad. I'll drive. I know I can drive." 
 And with the same dogged determination,that my father had bred into me since I was such a child --,he taught me how to sail,,knowing I could never see where I was going, I could never see the shore,,and I couldn't see the sails, and I couldn't see the destination.,But he told me to believe,and feel the wind in my face.,And that wind in my face made me believe,that he was mad and I would drive.,And for the next 11 years,,I swore nobody would ever find out that I couldn't see,,because I didn't want to be a failure,,and I didn't want to be weak.,And I believed I could do it.,So I rammed through life as only a Casey can do.,And I was an archeologist, and then I broke things.,And then I managed a restaurant, and then I slipped on things.,And then I was a masseuse. And then I was a landscape gardener.,And then I went to business school.,And you know, disabled people are hugely educated.,And then I went in and I got a global consulting job with Accenture.,And they didn't even know.,And it's extraordinary,how far belief can take you. 
 In 1999,,two and a half years into that job,,something happened.,Wonderfully, my eyes decided, enough.,And temporarily,,very unexpectedly,,they dropped.,And I'm in one of the most competitive environments in the world,,where you work hard, play hard, you gotta be the best, you gotta be the best.,And two years in,,I really could see very little.,And I found myself in front of an HR manager,in 1999,,saying something I never imagined that I would say.,I was 28 years old.,I had built a persona all around what I could and couldn't do.,And I simply said,,"I'm sorry.,I can't see, and I need help.",Asking for help can be incredibly difficult.,And you all know what it is. You don't need to have a disability to know that.,We all know how hard it is,to admit weakness and failure.,And it's frightening, isn't it?,But all that belief had fueled me so long. 
 And can I tell you, operating in the sighted world when you can't see,,it's kind of difficult -- it really is.,Can I tell you, airports are a disaster.,Oh, for the love of God.,And please, any designers out there?,OK, designers, please put up your hands, even though I can't even see you.,I always end up in the gents' toilets.,And there's nothing wrong with my sense of smell.,But can I just tell you,,the little sign for a gents' toilet or a ladies' toilet,is determined by a triangle.,Have you ever tried to see that,if you have Vaseline in front of your eyes?,It's such a small thing, right?,And you know how exhausting it can be,to try to be perfect when you're not,,or to be somebody that you aren't? 
 And so after admitting I couldn't see to HR,,they sent me off to an eye specialist.,And I had no idea that this man was going to change my life.,But before I got to him, I was so lost.,I had no idea who I was anymore.,And that eye specialist, he didn't bother testing my eyes.,God no, it was therapy.,And he asked me several questions,,of which many were, "Why?,Why are you fighting so hard,not to be yourself?,And do you love what you do, Caroline?",And you know, when you go to a global consulting firm,,they put a chip in your head, and you're like,,"I love Accenture. I love Accenture. I love my job. I love Accenture.,I love Accenture. I love Accenture. I love my job. I love Accenture." (Laughter),To leave would be failure.,And he said, "Do you love it?",I couldn't even speak I was so choked up.,I just was so -- how do I tell him?,And then he said to me, "What did you want to be when you were little?",Now listen, I wasn't going to say to him, "Well, I wanted to race cars and motorbikes.",Hardly appropriate at this moment in time.,He thought I was mad enough anyway.,And as I left his office,,he called me back,and he said, "I think it's time.,I think it's time,to stop fighting and do something different.",And that door closed.,And that silence just outside a doctor's office,,that many of us know.,And my chest ached.,And I had no idea where I was going. I had no idea.,But I did know the game was up. 
 And I went home, and, because the pain in my chest ached so much,,I thought, "I'll go out for a run.",Really not a very sensible thing to do.,And I went on a run that I know so well.,I know this run so well, by the back of my hand.,I always run it perfectly fine.,I count the steps and the lampposts and all those things,that visually impaired people have a tendency to have a lot of meetings with.,And there was a rock that I always missed.,And I'd never fallen on it, never.,And there I was crying away,,and smash, bash on my rock.,Broken, fallen over,on this rock,in the middle of March in 2000,,typical Irish weather on a Wednesday --,gray, snot, tears everywhere,,ridiculously self-pitying. 
 And I was floored, and I was broken,,and I was angry.,And I didn't know what to do.,And I sat there for quite some time going,,"How am I going to get off this rock and go home?,Because who am I going to be?,What am I going to be?",And I thought about my dad,,and I thought, "Good God, I'm so not Sue now.",And I kept thinking over and over in my mind,,what had happened? Where did it go wrong? Why didn't I understand?,And you know, the extraordinary part of it,is I just simply had no answers.,I had lost my belief.,Look where my belief had brought me to.,And now I had lost it. And now I really couldn't see.,I was crumpled.,And then I remember thinking about that eye specialist,asking me, "What do you want to be? What do you want to be?,What did you want to be when you were little? Do you love what you do?,Do something different. What do you want to be?,Do something different. What do you want to be?",And really slowly, slowly, slowly,,it happened.,And it did happen this way.,And then the minute it came,,it blew up in my head,and bashed in my heart --,something different.,"Well, how about Mowgli from 'The Jungle Book'?,You don't get more different than that.",And the moment, and I mean the moment,,the moment that hit me,,I swear to God,,it was like woo hoo! You know -- something to believe in.,And nobody can tell me no.,Yes, you can say I can't be an archeologist.,But you can't tell me, no, I can't be Mowgli, because guess what?,Nobody's ever done it before, so I'm going to go do it.,And it doesn't matter whether I'm a boy or a girl, I'm just going to scoot. 
 And so I got off that rock, and, oh my God, did I run home.,And I sprinted home, and I didn't fall, and I didn't crash.,And I ran up the stairs, and there was one of my favorite books of all time,,"Travels on My Elephant" by Mark Shand -- I don't know if any of you know it.,And I grabbed this book off, and I'm sitting on the couch,going, "I know what I'm going to do.,I know how to be Mowgli.,I'm going to go across India,on the back of an elephant.,I'm going to be an elephant handler.",And I had no idea,how I was going to be an elephant handler.,From global management consultant to elephant handler.,I had no idea how. I had no idea how you hire an elephant, get an elephant.,I didn't speak Hindi. I'd never been to India. Hadn't a clue.,But I knew I would.,Because, when you make a decision at the right time and the right place,,God, that universe makes it happen for you. 
 Nine months later, after that day on snot rock,,I had the only blind date in my life,with a seven and a half foot elephant called Kanchi.,And together we would trek a thousand kilometers,across India.,(Applause),The most powerful thing of all,,it's not that I didn't achieve before then. Oh my God, I did.,But you know, I was believing in the wrong thing.,Because I wasn't believing in me,,really me, all the bits of me --,all the bits of all of us.,Do you know how much of us all pretend to be somebody we're not?,And you know what, when you really believe in yourself and everything about you,,it's extraordinary what happens. 
 And you know what, that trip, that thousand kilometers,,it raised enough money for 6,000 cataract eye operations.,Six thousand people got to see because of that.,When I came home off that elephant,,do you know what the most amazing part was?,I chucked in my job at Accenture.,I left, and I became a social entrepreneur,,and I set up an organization with Mark Shand called Elephant Family,,which deals with Asian elephant conservation.,And I set up Kanchi,,because my organization was always going to be named after my elephant,,because disability is like the elephant in the room.,And I wanted to make you see it in a positive way --,no charity, no pity.,But I wanted to work only and truly,with business and media leadership,to totally reframe disability,in a way that was exciting and possible.,It was extraordinary.,That's what I wanted to do.,And I never thought about noes anymore, or not seeing,,or any of that kind of nothing.,It just seemed that it was possible. 
 And you know, the oddest part is,,when I was on my way traveling here to TED,,I'll be honest, I was petrified.,And I speak,,but this is an amazing audience,,and what am I doing here?,But as I was traveling here,,you'll be very happy to know,,I did use my white symbol stick cane,,because it's really good to skip queues in the airport.,And I got my way here,being happily proud that I couldn't see.,And the one thing is that a really good friend of mine,,he texted me on the way over, knowing I was scared.,Even though I present confident, I was scared.,He said, "Be you.",And so here I am.,This is me, all of me. 
 (Applause) 
 And I have learned, you know what,,cars and motorbikes and elephants,,that's not freedom.,Being absolutely true to yourself is freedom.,And I never needed eyes to see -- never.,I simply needed vision and belief.,And if you truly believe --,and I mean believe from the bottom of your heart --,you can make change happen.,And we need to make it happen,,because every single one of us --,woman, man, gay, straight,,disabled, perfect,,normal, whatever --,everyone of us,must be the very best of ourselves.,I no longer want anybody to be invisible.,We all have to be included.,And stop with the labels, the limiting.,Losing of labels,,because we are not jam jars.,We are extraordinary, different, wonderful people. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I want to address the issue of compassion.,Compassion has many faces.,Some of them are fierce; some of them are wrathful;,some of them are tender; some of them are wise.,A line that the Dalai Lama once said,,he said, "Love and compassion are necessities.,They are not luxuries.,Without them,,humanity cannot survive.",And I would suggest,,it is not only humanity that won't survive,,but it is all species on the planet,,as we've heard today.,It is the big cats,,and it's the plankton. 
 Two weeks ago, I was in Bangalore in India.,I was so privileged,to be able to teach in a hospice,on the outskirts of Bangalore.,And early in the morning,,I went into the ward.,In that hospice,,there were 31 men and women,who were actively dying.,And I walked up to the bedside,of an old woman,who was breathing very rapidly, fragile,,obviously in the latter phase,of active dying.,I looked into her face.,I looked into the face,of her son sitting next to her,,and his face was just riven,with grief and confusion. 
 And I remembered,a line from the Mahabharata,,the great Indian epic:,"What is the most wondrous thing in the world, Yudhisthira?",And Yudhisthira replied,,"The most wondrous thing in the world,is that all around us,people can be dying,and we don't realize,it can happen to us.",I looked up.,Tending those 31 dying people,were young women,from villages around Bangalore.,I looked into the face of one of these women,,and I saw in her face,the strength that arises,when natural compassion is really present.,I watched her hands,as she bathed an old man. 
 My gaze went to another young woman,as she wiped the face,of another dying person.,And it reminded me,of something that I had just been present for.,Every year or so,,I have the privilege of taking clinicians,into the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau.,And we run clinics,in these very remote regions,where there's no medical care whatsoever. 
 And on the first day at Simikot in Humla,,far west of Nepal,,the most impoverished region of Nepal,,an old man came in,clutching a bundle of rags.,And he walked in, and somebody said something to him,,we realized he was deaf,,and we looked into the rags,,and there was this pair of eyes.,The rags were unwrapped,from a little girl,whose body was massively burned.,Again,,the eyes and hands,of Avalokiteshvara.,It was the young women, the health aids,,who cleaned the wounds of this baby,and dressed the wounds. 
 I know those hands and eyes;,they touched me as well.,They touched me at that time.,They have touched me throughout my 68 years.,They touched me when I was four,and I lost my eyesight,and was partially paralyzed.,And my family brought in,a woman whose mother had been a slave,to take care of me.,And that woman,did not have sentimental compassion.,She had phenomenal strength.,And it was really her strength, I believe,,that became the kind of mudra and imprimatur,that has been a guiding light in my life. 
 So we can ask:,What is compassion comprised of?,And there are various facets.,And there's referential and non-referential compassion.,But first, compassion is comprised,of that capacity,to see clearly,into the nature of suffering.,It is that ability,to really stand strong,and to recognize also,that I'm not separate from this suffering.,But that is not enough,,because compassion,,which activates the motor cortex,,means that we aspire,,we actually aspire to transform suffering.,And if we're so blessed,,we engage in activities,that transform suffering.,But compassion has another component,,and that component is really essential.,That component,is that we cannot be attached to outcome. 
 Now I worked with dying people,for over 40 years.,I had the privilege of working on death row,in a maximum security [prison] for six years.,And I realized so clearly,in bringing my own life experience,,from working with dying people,and training caregivers,,that any attachment to outcome,would distort deeply,my own capacity to be fully present,to the whole catastrophe. 
 And when I worked in the prison system,,it was so clear to me, this:,that many of us,in this room,,and almost all of the men that I worked with on death row,,the seeds of their own compassion had never been watered.,That compassion is actually,an inherent human quality.,It is there within every human being.,But the conditions,for compassion to be activated,,to be aroused,,are particular conditions.,I had that condition, to a certain extent,,from my own childhood illness.,Eve Ensler, whom you'll hear later,,has had that condition activated,amazingly in her,through the various waters of suffering,that she has been through. 
 And what is fascinating,is that compassion has enemies,,and those enemies are things like pity,,moral outrage,,fear.,And you know, we have a society, a world,,that is paralyzed by fear.,And in that paralysis, of course,,our capacity for compassion,is also paralyzed.,The very word terror,is global.,The very feeling of terror is global.,So our work, in a certain way,,is to address this imago,,this kind of archetype,that has pervaded the psyche,of our entire globe. 
 Now we know from neuroscience,that compassion has,some very extraordinary qualities.,For example:,A person who is cultivating compassion,,when they are in the presence of suffering,,they feel that suffering a lot more,than many other people do.,However,,they return to baseline a lot sooner.,This is called resilience.,Many of us think that compassion drains us,,but I promise you,it is something that truly enlivens us. 
 Another thing about compassion,is that it really enhances what's called neural integration.,It hooks up all parts of the brain.,Another, which has been discovered,by various researchers,at Emory and at Davis and so on,,is that compassion enhances our immune system.,Hey,,we live in a very noxious world.,(Laughter),Most of us are shrinking,in the face of psycho-social and physical poisons,,of the toxins of our world.,But compassion, the generation of compassion,,actually mobilizes,our immunity. 
 You know, if compassion is so good for us,,I have a question.,Why don't we train our children,in compassion?,(Applause),If compassion is so good for us,,why don't we train our health care providers in compassion,so that they can do what they're supposed to do,,which is to really transform suffering?,And if compassion is so good for us,,why don't we vote on compassion?,Why don't we vote for people in our government,based on compassion,,so that we can have,a more caring world?,In Buddhism,,we say, "it takes a strong back and a soft front.",It takes tremendous strength of the back,to uphold yourself in the midst of conditions.,And that is the mental quality of equanimity. 
 But it also takes a soft front --,the capacity to really be open to the world as it is,,to have an undefended heart.,And the archetype of this in Buddhism,is Avalokiteshvara, Kuan-Yin.,It's a female archetype:,she who perceives,the cries of suffering in the world.,She stands with 10,000 arms,,and in every hand,,there is an instrument of liberation,,and in the palm of every hand, there are eyes,,and these are the eyes of wisdom.,I say that, for thousands of years,,women have lived,,exemplified, met in intimacy,,the archetype of Avalokitesvara,,of Kuan-Yin,,she who perceives,the cries of suffering in the world. 
 Women have manifested for thousands of years,the strength arising from compassion,in an unfiltered, unmediated way,in perceiving suffering,as it is.,They have infused societies with kindness,,and we have really felt that,as woman after woman,has stood on this stage,in the past day and a half.,And they have actualized compassion,through direct action.,Jody Williams called it:,It's good to meditate.,I'm sorry, you've got to do a little bit of that, Jody.,Step back, give your mother a break, okay. 
 (Laughter) 
 But the other side of the equation,is you've got to come out of your cave.,You have to come into the world,like Asanga did,,who was looking to realize Maitreya Buddha,after 12 years sitting in the cave.,He said, "I'm out of here.",He's going down the path.,He sees something in the path.,He looks, it's a dog, he drops to his knees.,He sees that the dog has this big wound on its leg.,The wound is just filled with maggots.,He puts out his tongue,in order to remove the maggots,,so as not to harm them.,And at that moment,,the dog transformed,into the Buddha of love and kindness. 
 I believe,that women and girls today,have to partner in a powerful way with men --,with their fathers,,with their sons, with their brothers,,with the plumbers, the road builders,,the caregivers, the doctors, the lawyers,,with our president,,and with all beings.,The women in this room,are lotuses in a sea of fire.,May we actualize that capacity,for women everywhere. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I want to say that really and truly,,after these incredible speeches,and ideas that are being spread,,I am in the awkward position,of being here to talk to you today,about television.,So most everyone watches TV.,We like it. We like some parts of it.,Here in America, people actually love TV.,The average American watches TV,for almost 5 hours a day.,Okay?,Now I happen to make my living these days in television,,so for me, that's a good thing.,But a lot of people don't love it so much.,They, in fact, berate it.,They call it stupid,,and worse, believe me.,My mother, growing up,,she called it the "idiot box." 
 But my idea today is not to debate,whether there's such a thing as good TV or bad TV;,my idea today,is to tell you that I believe,television has a conscience.,So why I believe that television has a conscience,is that I actually believe,that television directly reflects,the moral, political,,social and emotional need states of our nation --,that television is how we actually disseminate,our entire value system.,So all these things are uniquely human,,and they all add up,to our idea of conscience. 
 Now today, we're not talking about good and bad TV.,We're talking about popular TV.,We're talking about top-10 Nielsen-rated shows,over the course of 50 years.,How do these Nielsen ratings,reflect not just what you've heard about,,which is the idea of our social, collective unconscious,,but how do these top-10 Nielsen-rated shows,over 50 years,reflect the idea,of our social conscience?,How does television evolve over time,,and what does this say about our society? 
 Now speaking of evolution,,from basic biology, you probably remember,that the animal kingdom, including humans,,have four basic primal instincts.,You have hunger; you have sex; you have power;,and you have the urge for acquisitiveness.,As humans, what's important to remember,is that we've developed, we've evolved over time,to temper, or tame,,these basic animal instincts.,We have the capacity to laugh and cry.,We feel awe, we feel pity.,That is separate and apart,from the animal kingdom.,The other thing about human beings,is that we love to be entertained.,We love to watch TV.,This is something that clearly separates us,from the animal kingdom.,Animals might love to play,,but they don't love to watch. 
 So I had an ambition,to discover what could be understood,from this uniquely human relationship,between television programs,and the human conscious.,Why has television entertainment evolved the way it has?,I kind of think of it,as this cartoon devil or angel,sitting on our shoulders.,Is television literally functioning,as our conscience,,tempting us and rewarding us at the same time? 
 So to begin to answer these questions,,we did a research study.,We went back 50 years,to the 1959/1960 television season.,We surveyed the top-20 Nielsen shows,every year for 50 years --,a thousand shows.,We talked to over 3,000 individuals --,almost 3,600 --,aged 18 to 70,,and we asked them how they felt emotionally.,How did you feel,watching every single one of these shows?,Did you feel a sense of moral ambiguity?,Did you feel outrage? Did you laugh?,What did this mean for you?,So to our global TED audiences,,I want to say that this was a U.S. sample.,But as you can see,,these emotional need states are truly universal.,And on a factual basis,,over 80 percent of the U.S.'s most popular shows,are exported around the world.,So I really hope our global audiences,can relate. 
 Two acknowledgments,before our first data slide:,For inspiring me,to even think about the idea of conscience,and the tricks that conscience can play on us on a daily basis,,I thank legendary rabbi, Jack Stern.,And for the way in which I'm going to present the data,,I want to thank TED community superstar Hans Rosling,,who you may have just seen. 
 Okay, here we go.,So here you see,,from 1960 to 2010,,the 50 years of our study.,Two things we're going to start with --,the inspiration state and the moral ambiguity state,,which, for this purpose,,we defined inspiration,as television shows that uplift me,,that make me feel much more positive about the world.,Moral ambiguity are televisions shows,in which I don't understand,the difference between right and wrong.,As we start, you see in 1960,inspiration is holding steady.,That's what we're watching TV for.,Moral ambiguity starts to climb.,Right at the end of the 60s,,moral ambiguity is going up,,inspiration is kind of on the wane.,Why?,The Cuban Missile Crisis, JFK is shot,,the Civil Rights movement,,race riots, the Vietnam War,,MLK is shot, Bobby Kennedy is shot,,Watergate.,Look what happens.,In 1970, inspiration plummets.,Moral ambiguity takes off.,They cross,,but Ronald Reagan, a telegenic president, is in office.,It's trying to recover.,But look, it can't:,AIDS, Iran-Contra,,the Challenger disaster, Chernobyl.,Moral ambiguity becomes the dominant meme in television,from 1990 for the next 20 years. 
 Take a look at this.,This chart is going to document a very similar trend.,But in this case, we have comfort -- the bubble in red --,social commentary and irreverence,in blue and green.,Now this time on TV,you have "Bonanza," don't forget, you have "Gunsmoke,",you have "Andy Griffith,",you have domestic shows all about comfort.,This is rising. Comfort stays whole.,Irreverence starts to rise.,Social commentary is all of a sudden spiking up.,You get to 1969, and look what happens.,You have comfort, irreverence, and social commentary,,not only battling it out in our society,,but you literally have two establishment shows --,"Gunsmoke" and "Gomer Pyle" --,in 1969 are the number-two- and number-three-rated television shows.,What's number one?,The socially irreverent hippie show,,"Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In.",They're all living together, right.,Viewers had responded dramatically. 
 Look at this green spike in 1966,to a bellwether show.,When you guys hear this industry term, a breakout hit,,what does that mean?,It means in the 1966 television season,,The "Smothers Brothers" came out of nowhere.,This was the first show,that allowed viewers to say,,"My God,,I can comment on how I feel about the Vietnam War,,about the presidency, through television?",That's what we mean by a breakout show. 
 So then, just like the last chart, look what happens.,In 1970,,the dam bursts. The dam bursts.,Comfort is no longer why we watch television.,Social commentary and irreverence,rise throughout the 70s.,Now look at this.,The 70s means who? Norman Lear.,You have "All in the Family," "Sanford and Son,",and the dominant show --,in the top-10 for the entire 70s --,"MAS*H.",In the entire 50 years,of television that we studied,,seven of 10 shows,ranked most highly for irreverence,appeared on air during the Vietnam War,,five of the top-10 during the Nixon administration.,Only one generation, 20 years in,,and we discovered,,Wow! TV can do that?,It can make me feel this?,It can change us?,So to this very, very savvy crowd,,I also want to note,the digital folks did not invent disruptive.,Archie Bunker was shoved out of his easy chair,along with the rest of us,40 years ago. 
 This is a quick chart. Here's another attribute:,fantasy and imagination,,which are shows defined as,,"takes me out of my everyday realm",and "makes me feel better.",That's mapped against the red dot, unemployment,,which is a simple Bureau of Labor Department statistic.,You'll see,that every time fantasy and imagination shows rise,,it maps to a spike in unemployment.,Do we want to see shows,about people saving money and being unemployed?,No. In the 70s,you have the bellwether show "The Bionic Woman",that rocketed into the top-10 in 1973,,followed by the "Six Million-Dollar Man" and "Charlie's Angels.",Another spike in the 1980s --,another spike in shows about control and power.,What were those shows?,Glamorous and rich.,"Dallas," "Fantasy Island.",Incredible mapping of our national psyche,with some hard and fast facts:,unemployment. 
 So here you are, in my favorite chart,,because this is our last 20 years.,Whether or not you're in my business,,you have surely heard or read,of the decline of the thing called the three-camera sitcom,and the rise of reality TV.,Well, as we say in the business,,X marks the spot.,The 90s -- the big bubbles of humor --,we're watching "Friends," "Frasier," "Cheers" and "Seinfeld.",Everything's good, low unemployment.,But look: X marks the spot.,In 2001,,the September 2001 television season,,humor succumbs to judgment once and for all.,Why not?,We had a 2000 presidential election,decided by the Supreme Court.,We had the bursting of the tech bubble.,We had 9/11.,Anthrax becomes part of the social lexicon.,Look what happens when we keep going.,At the turn of the century, the Internet takes off,,reality television has taken hold.,What do people want in their TV then?,I would have thought revenge,or nostalgia.,Give me some comfort; my world is falling apart.,No, they want judgment.,I can vote you off the island.,I can keep Sarah Palin's daughter dancing.,I can choose the next American Idol. You're fired.,That's all great, right? 
 So as dramatically different as these television shows,,pure entertainment, have been over the last 50 years --,what did I start with? --,one basic instinct remains.,We're animals, we need our moms.,There has not been a decade of television,without a definitive, dominant TV mom.,The 1950s:,June Cleever in the original comfort show, "Leave it to Beaver.",Lucille Ball kept us laughing,through the rise of social consciousness in the 60s.,Maude Findlay,,the epitome of the irreverent 1970s,,who tackled abortion, divorce,,even menopause on TV.,The 1980s,,our first cougar was given to us,in the form of Alexis Carrington.,Murphy Brown took on a vice president,when she took on the idea of single parenthood.,This era's mom,,Bree Van de Kamp.,Now I don't know if this is the devil or the angel,sitting on our conscience,,sitting on television's shoulders,,but I do know that I absolutely love this image. 
 So to you all,,the women of TEDWomen, the men of TEDWomen,,the global audiences of TEDWomen,,thank you for letting me present my idea,about the conscience of television.,But let me also thank the incredible creators,who get up everyday,to put their ideas on our television screens,throughout all these ages of television.,They give it life on television, for sure,,but it's you as viewers,,through your collective social consciences,,that give it life, longevity,,power or not. 
 So thanks very much. 
 (Applause)For a long time,,there was me, and my body.,Me was composed of stories,,of cravings, of strivings,,of desires of the future.,Me was trying,not to be an outcome of my violent past,,but the separation that had already occurred,between me and my body,was a pretty significant outcome.,Me was always trying to become something, somebody.,Me only existed in the trying.,My body was often in the way. 
 Me was a floating head.,For years, I actually only wore hats.,It was a way of keeping my head attached.,It was a way of locating myself.,I worried that [if] I took my hat off,I wouldn't be here anymore.,I actually had a therapist who once said to me,,"Eve, you've been coming here for two years,,and, to be honest, it never occurred to me that you had a body.",All this time I lived in the city,because, to be honest,,I was afraid of trees.,I never had babies,because heads cannot give birth.,Babies actually don't come out of your mouth. 
 As I had no reference point for my body,,I began to ask other women about their bodies --,in particular, their vaginas,,because I thought vaginas were kind of important.,This led to me writing "The Vagina Monologues,",which led to me obsessively and incessantly,talking about vaginas everywhere I could.,I did this in front of many strangers.,One night on stage,,I actually entered my vagina.,It was an ecstatic experience.,It scared me, it energized me,,and then I became a driven person,,a driven vagina. 
 I began to see my body like a thing,,a thing that could move fast,,like a thing that could accomplish other things,,many things, all at once.,I began to see my body like an iPad or a car.,I would drive it and demand things from it.,It had no limits. It was invincible.,It was to be conquered and mastered like the Earth herself.,I didn't heed it;,no, I organized it and I directed it.,I didn't have patience for my body;,I snapped it into shape.,I was greedy.,I took more than my body had to offer.,If I was tired, I drank more espressos.,If I was afraid, I went to more dangerous places. 
 Oh sure, sure, I had moments of appreciation of my body,,the way an abusive parent,can sometimes have a moment of kindness.,My father was really kind to me,on my 16th birthday, for example.,I heard people murmur from time to time,that I should love my body,,so I learned how to do this.,I was a vegetarian, I was sober, I didn't smoke.,But all that was just a more sophisticated way,to manipulate my body --,a further disassociation,,like planting a vegetable field on a freeway. 
 As a result of me talking so much about my vagina,,many women started to tell me about theirs --,their stories about their bodies.,Actually, these stories compelled me around the world,,and I've been to over 60 countries.,I heard thousands of stories,,and I have to tell you, there was always this moment,where the women shared with me,that particular moment when she separated from her body --,when she left home.,I heard about women being molested in their beds,,flogged in their burqas,,left for dead in parking lots,,acid burned in their kitchens.,Some women became quiet and disappeared.,Other women became mad, driven machines like me. 
 In the middle of my traveling,,I turned 40 and I began to hate my body,,which was actually progress,,because at least my body existed enough to hate it.,Well my stomach -- it was my stomach I hated.,It was proof that I had not measured up,,that I was old and not fabulous and not perfect,or able to fit into the predetermined corporate image in shape.,My stomach was proof that I had failed,,that it had failed me, that it was broken.,My life became about getting rid of it and obsessing about getting rid of it.,In fact, it became so extreme,I wrote a play about it.,But the more I talked about it,,the more objectified and fragmented my body became.,It became entertainment; it became a new kind of commodity,,something I was selling. 
 Then I went somewhere else.,I went outside,what I thought I knew.,I went to the Democratic Republic of Congo.,And I heard stories,that shattered all the other stories.,I heard stories,that got inside my body.,I heard about a little girl,who couldn't stop peeing on herself,because so many grown soldiers,had shoved themselves inside her.,I heard an 80-year-old woman,whose legs were broken and pulled out of her sockets,and twisted up on her head,as the soldiers raped her like that.,There are thousands of these stories,,and many of the women had holes in their bodies --,holes, fistula --,that were the violation of war --,holes in the fabric of their souls.,These stories saturated my cells and nerves,,and to be honest,,I stopped sleeping for three years. 
 All the stories began to bleed together.,The raping of the Earth,,the pillaging of minerals,,the destruction of vaginas --,none of these were separate anymore,from each other or me.,Militias were raping six-month-old babies,so that countries far away,could get access to gold and coltan,for their iPhones and computers.,My body had not only become a driven machine,,but it was responsible now,for destroying other women's bodies,in its mad quest to make more machines,to support the speed and efficiency of my machine. 
 Then I got cancer --,or I found out I had cancer.,It arrived like a speeding bird,smashing into a windowpane.,Suddenly, I had a body,,a body that was pricked,and poked and punctured,,a body that was cut wide open,,a body that had organs removed,and transported and rearranged and reconstructed,,a body that was scanned,and had tubes shoved down it,,a body that was burning from chemicals.,Cancer exploded,the wall of my disconnection.,I suddenly understood that the crisis in my body,was the crisis in the world,,and it wasn't happening later,,it was happening now. 
 Suddenly, my cancer was a cancer that was everywhere,,the cancer of cruelty, the cancer of greed,,the cancer that gets inside people,who live down the streets from chemical plants -- and they're usually poor --,the cancer inside the coal miner's lungs,,the cancer of stress for not achieving enough,,the cancer of buried trauma,,the cancer in caged chickens and polluted fish,,the cancer in women's uteruses from being raped,,the cancer that is everywhere from our carelessness. 
 In his new and visionary book,,"New Self, New World,",the writer Philip Shepherd says,,"If you are divided from your body,,you are also divided from the body of the world,,which then appears to be other than you,or separate from you,,rather than the living continuum,to which you belong.",Before cancer,,the world was something other.,It was as if I was living in a stagnant pool,and cancer dynamited the boulder,that was separating me from the larger sea.,Now I am swimming in it.,Now I lay down in the grass,and I rub my body in it,,and I love the mud on my legs and feet.,Now I make a daily pilgrimage,to visit a particular weeping willow by the Seine,,and I hunger for the green fields,in the bush outside Bukavu.,And when it rains hard rain,,I scream and I run in circles. 
 I know that everything is connected,,and the scar that runs the length of my torso,is the markings of the earthquake.,And I am there with the three million in the streets of Port-au-Prince.,And the fire that burned in me,on day three through six of chemo,is the fire that is burning,in the forests of the world.,I know that the abscess,that grew around my wound after the operation,,the 16 ounces of puss,,is the contaminated Gulf of Mexico,,and there were oil-drenched pelicans inside me,and dead floating fish.,And the catheters they shoved into me without proper medication,made me scream out,the way the Earth cries out from the drilling. 
 In my second chemo,,my mother got very sick,and I went to see her.,And in the name of connectedness,,the only thing she wanted before she died,was to be brought home,by her beloved Gulf of Mexico.,So we brought her home,,and I prayed that the oil wouldn't wash up on her beach,before she died.,And gratefully, it didn't.,And she died quietly in her favorite place. 
 And a few weeks later, I was in New Orleans,,and this beautiful, spiritual friend,told me she wanted to do a healing for me.,And I was honored.,And I went to her house, and it was morning,,and the morning New Orleans sun was filtering through the curtains.,And my friend was preparing this big bowl,,and I said, "What is it?",And she said, "It's for you.,The flowers make it beautiful,,and the honey makes it sweet.",And I said, "But what's the water part?",And in the name of connectedness,,she said, "Oh, it's the Gulf of Mexico.",And I said, "Of course it is.",And the other women arrived and they sat in a circle,,and Michaela bathed my head with the sacred water.,And she sang -- I mean her whole body sang.,And the other women sang,and they prayed for me and my mother. 
 And as the warm Gulf washed over my naked head,,I realized that it held,the best and the worst of us.,It was the greed and recklessness,that led to the drilling explosion.,It was all the lies that got told,before and after.,It was the honey in the water that made it sweet,,it was the oil that made it sick.,It was my head that was bald --,and comfortable now without a hat.,It was my whole self,melting into Michaela's lap.,It was the tears that were indistinguishable from the Gulf,that were falling down my cheek.,It was finally being in my body.,It was the sorrow,that's taken so long.,It was finding my place,and the huge responsibility,that comes with connection.,It was the continuing devastating war in the Congo,and the indifference of the world.,It was the Congolese women,who are now rising up.,It was my mother leaving,,just at the moment,that I was being born.,It was the realization,that I had come very close to dying --,in the same way that the Earth, our mother,,is barely holding on,,in the same way that 75 percent of the planet,are hardly scraping by,,in the same way,that there is a recipe for survival. 
 What I learned,is it has to do with attention and resources,that everybody deserves.,It was advocating friends,and a doting sister.,It was wise doctors and advanced medicine,and surgeons who knew what to do with their hands.,It was underpaid and really loving nurses.,It was magic healers and aromatic oils.,It was people who came with spells and rituals.,It was having a vision of the future,and something to fight for,,because I know this struggle isn't my own.,It was a million prayers.,It was a thousand hallelujahs,and a million oms.,It was a lot of anger,,insane humor,,a lot of attention, outrage.,It was energy, love and joy.,It was all these things.,It was all these things.,It was all these things,in the water, in the world, in my body. 
 (Applause)I was only four years old,when I saw my mother load a washing machine,for the very first time in her life.,That was a great day for my mother.,My mother and father had been saving money for years,to be able to buy that machine,,and the first day it was going to be used,,even Grandma was invited,to see the machine.,And Grandma was even more excited.,Throughout her life,she had been heating water with firewood,,and she had hand washed laundry,for seven children.,And now she was going to watch,electricity do that work. 
 My mother carefully opened the door,,and she loaded the laundry,into the machine,,like this.,And then, when she closed the door,,Grandma said, "No, no, no, no.,Let me, let me push the button.",And Grandma pushed the button,,and she said, "Oh, fantastic!,I want to see this! Give me a chair!,Give me a chair! I want to see it,",and she sat down in front of the machine,,and she watched the entire washing program.,She was mesmerized.,To my grandmother,,the washing machine was a miracle. 
 Today, in Sweden and other rich countries,,people are using,so many different machines.,Look, the homes are full of machines.,I can't even name them all.,And they also, when they want to travel,,they use flying machines,that can take them to remote destinations.,And yet, in the world, there are so many people,who still heat the water on fire,,and they cook their food on fire.,Sometimes they don't even have enough food,,and they live below the poverty line.,There are two billion fellow human beings,who live on less than two dollars a day.,And the richest people over there --,there's one billion people --,and they live above what I call the "air line,",because they spend more than $80 a day,on their consumption. 
 But this is just one, two, three billion people,,and obviously there are seven billion people in the world,,so there must be one, two, three, four billion people more,who live in between the poverty and the air line.,They have electricity,,but the question is, how many have washing machines?,I've done the scrutiny of market data,,and I've found that, indeed,,the washing machine has penetrated below the air line,,and today there's an additional one billion people out there,who live above the "wash line.",(Laughter),And they consume more than $40 per day.,So two billion have access to washing machines. 
 And the remaining five billion,,how do they wash?,Or, to be more precise,,how do most of the women in the world wash?,Because it remains hard work for women to wash.,They wash like this: by hand.,It's a hard, time-consuming labor,,which they have to do for hours every week.,And sometimes they also have to bring water from far away,to do the laundry at home,,or they have to bring the laundry away to a stream far off.,And they want the washing machine.,They don't want to spend such a large part of their life,doing this hard work,with so relatively low productivity.,And there's nothing different in their wish,than it was for my grandma.,Look here, two generations ago in Sweden --,picking water from the stream,,heating with firewood and washing like that.,They want the washing machine in exactly the same way. 
 But when I lecture to environmentally-concerned students,,they tell me, "No, everybody in the world cannot have cars and washing machines.",How can we tell this woman,that she ain't going to have a washing machine?,And then I ask my students,,I've asked them -- over the last two years I've asked,,"How many of you doesn't use a car?",And some of them proudly raise their hand,and say, "I don't use a car.",And then I put the really tough question:,"How many of you,hand-wash your jeans and your bed sheets?",And no one raised their hand.,Even the hardcore in the green movement,use washing machines. 
 (Laughter) 
 So how come [this is] something that everyone uses,and they think others will not stop it? What is special with this?,I had to do an analysis about the energy used in the world.,Here we are.,Look here, you see the seven billion people up there:,the air people, the wash people,,the bulb people and the fire people.,One unit like this,is an energy unit of fossil fuel --,oil, coal or gas.,That's what most of electricity and the energy in the world is.,And it's 12 units used in the entire world,,and the richest one billion, they use six of them.,Half of the energy is used by one seventh of the world's population.,And these ones who have washing machines,,but not a house full of other machines,,they use two.,This group uses three, one each.,And they also have electricity.,And over there they don't even use one each.,That makes 12 of them. 
 But the main concern,for the environmentally-interested students -- and they are right --,is about the future.,What are the trends? If we just prolong the trends,,without any real advanced analysis, to 2050,,there are two things that can increase the energy use.,First, population growth.,Second, economic growth.,Population growth will mainly occur among the poorest people here,because they have high child mortality,and they have many children per woman.,And [with] that you will get two extra,,but that won't change the energy use very much. 
 What will happen is economic growth.,The best of here in the emerging economies --,I call them the New East --,they will jump the air line.,"Wopp!" they will say.,And they will start to use as much as the Old West are doing already.,And these people, they want the washing machine.,I told you. They'll go there.,And they will double their energy use.,And we hope that the poor people will get into the electric light.,And they'll get a two-child family without a stop in population growth.,But the total energy consumption,will increase to 22 units.,And these 22 units --,still the richest people use most of it.,So what needs to be done?,Because the risk,,the high probability of climate change is real.,It's real.,Of course they must be more energy-efficient.,They must change behavior in some way.,They must also start to produce green energy,,much more green energy.,But until they have the same energy consumption per person,,they shouldn't give advice to others --,what to do and what not to do.,(Applause),Here we can get more green energy all over. 
 This is what we hope may happen.,It's a real challenge in the future.,But I can assure you that this woman in the favela in Rio,,she wants a washing machine.,She's very happy about her minister of energy,that provided electricity to everyone --,so happy that she even voted for her.,And she became Dilma Rousseff,,the president-elect,of one of the biggest democracies in the world --,moving from minister of energy to president.,If you have democracy,,people will vote for washing machines.,They love them. 
 And what's the magic with them?,My mother explained the magic with this machine,the very, very first day.,She said, "Now Hans,,we have loaded the laundry.,The machine will make the work.,And now we can go to the library.",Because this is the magic:,you load the laundry,,and what do you get out of the machine?,You get books out of the machines,,children's books.,And mother got time to read for me.,She loved this. I got the "ABC's" --,this is where I started my career as a professor,,when my mother had time to read for me.,And she also got books for herself.,She managed to study English,and learn that as a foreign language.,And she read so many novels,,so many different novels here.,And we really, we really loved this machine. 
 And what we said, my mother and me,,"Thank you industrialization.,Thank you steel mill.,Thank you power station.,And thank you chemical processing industry,that gave us time to read books." 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I know what you're thinking.,You think I've lost my way,,and somebody's going to come on the stage in a minute,and guide me gently back to my seat.,(Applause),I get that all the time in Dubai.,"Here on holiday are you, dear?",(Laughter),"Come to visit the children?,How long are you staying?" 
 Well actually, I hope for a while longer yet.,I have been living and teaching in the Gulf,for over 30 years.,(Applause),And in that time, I have seen a lot of changes.,Now that statistic,is quite shocking.,And I want to talk to you today,about language loss,and the globalization of English.,I want to tell you about my friend,who was teaching English to adults in Abu Dhabi.,And one fine day,,she decided to take them into the garden,to teach them some nature vocabulary.,But it was she who ended up learning,all the Arabic words for the local plants,,as well as their uses --,medicinal uses, cosmetics,,cooking, herbal.,How did those students get all that knowledge?,Of course, from their grandparents,and even their great-grandparents.,It's not necessary to tell you how important it is,to be able to communicate,across generations. 
 But sadly, today,,languages are dying,at an unprecedented rate.,A language dies every 14 days.,Now, at the same time,,English is the undisputed global language.,Could there be a connection?,Well I don't know.,But I do know that I've seen a lot of changes.,When I first came out to the Gulf, I came to Kuwait,in the days when it was still a hardship post.,Actually, not that long ago.,That is a little bit too early.,But nevertheless,,I was recruited by the British Council,,along with about 25 other teachers.,And we were the first non-Muslims,to teach in the state schools there in Kuwait.,We were brought to teach English,because the government wanted to modernize the country,and to empower the citizens through education.,And of course, the U.K. benefited,from some of that lovely oil wealth. 
 Okay.,Now this is the major change that I've seen --,how teaching English,has morphed,from being a mutually beneficial practice,to becoming a massive international business that it is today.,No longer just a foreign language on the school curriculum,,and no longer the sole domain,of mother England,,it has become a bandwagon,for every English-speaking nation on earth.,And why not?,After all, the best education --,according to the latest World University Rankings --,is to be found in the universities,of the U.K. and the U.S.,So everybody wants to have an English education, naturally.,But if you're not a native speaker,,you have to pass a test. 
 Now can it be right,to reject a student,on linguistic ability alone?,Perhaps you have a computer scientist,who's a genius.,Would he need the same language as a lawyer, for example?,Well, I don't think so.,We English teachers reject them all the time.,We put a stop sign,,and we stop them in their tracks.,They can't pursue their dream any longer,,'til they get English.,Now let me put it this way:,if I met a monolingual Dutch speaker,who had the cure for cancer,,would I stop him from entering my British University?,I don't think so.,But indeed, that is exactly what we do.,We English teachers are the gatekeepers.,And you have to satisfy us first,that your English is good enough.,Now it can be dangerous,to give too much power,to a narrow segment of society.,Maybe the barrier would be too universal. 
 Okay.,"But," I hear you say,,"what about the research?,It's all in English.",So the books are in English,,the journals are done in English,,but that is a self-fulfilling prophecy.,It feeds the English requirement.,And so it goes on.,I ask you, what happened to translation?,If you think about the Islamic Golden Age,,there was lots of translation then.,They translated from Latin and Greek,into Arabic, into Persian,,and then it was translated on,into the Germanic languages of Europe,and the Romance languages.,And so light shone upon the Dark Ages of Europe.,Now don't get me wrong;,I am not against teaching English,,all you English teachers out there.,I love it that we have a global language.,We need one today more than ever.,But I am against using it,as a barrier.,Do we really want to end up with 600 languages,and the main one being English, or Chinese?,We need more than that. Where do we draw the line?,This system,equates intelligence,with a knowledge of English,,which is quite arbitrary. 
 (Applause) 
 And I want to remind you,that the giants upon whose shoulders,today's intelligentsia stand,did not have to have English,,they didn't have to pass an English test.,Case in point, Einstein.,He, by the way, was considered remedial at school,because he was, in fact, dyslexic.,But fortunately for the world,,he did not have to pass an English test.,Because they didn't start until 1964,with TOEFL,,the American test of English.,Now it's exploded.,There are lots and lots of tests of English.,And millions and millions of students,take these tests every year.,Now you might think, you and me,,"Those fees aren't bad, they're okay,",but they are prohibitive,to so many millions of poor people.,So immediately, we're rejecting them. 
 (Applause) 
 It brings to mind a headline I saw recently:,"Education: The Great Divide.",Now I get it,,I understand why people would want to focus on English.,They want to give their children the best chance in life.,And to do that, they need a Western education.,Because, of course, the best jobs,go to people out of the Western Universities,,that I put on earlier.,It's a circular thing. 
 Okay.,Let me tell you a story about two scientists,,two English scientists.,They were doing an experiment,to do with genetics,and the forelimbs and the hind limbs of animals.,But they couldn't get the results they wanted.,They really didn't know what to do,,until along came a German scientist,who realized that they were using two words,for forelimb and hind limb,,whereas genetics does not differentiate,and neither does German.,So bingo,,problem solved.,If you can't think a thought,,you are stuck.,But if another language can think that thought,,then, by cooperating,,we can achieve and learn so much more. 
 My daughter,came to England from Kuwait.,She had studied science and mathematics in Arabic.,It's an Arabic-medium school.,She had to translate it into English at her grammar school.,And she was the best in the class,at those subjects.,Which tells us,that when students come to us from abroad,,we may not be giving them enough credit,for what they know,,and they know it in their own language.,When a language dies,,we don't know what we lose with that language. 
 This is -- I don't know if you saw it on CNN recently --,they gave the Heroes Award,to a young Kenyan shepherd boy,who couldn't study at night in his village,,like all the village children,,because the kerosene lamp,,it had smoke and it damaged his eyes.,And anyway, there was never enough kerosene,,because what does a dollar a day buy for you?,So he invented,a cost-free solar lamp.,And now the children in his village,get the same grades at school,as the children who have electricity at home.,(Applause),When he received his award,,he said these lovely words:,"The children can lead Africa from what it is today,,a dark continent,,to a light continent.",A simple idea,,but it could have such far-reaching consequences. 
 People who have no light,,whether it's physical or metaphorical,,cannot pass our exams,,and we can never know what they know.,Let us not keep them and ourselves,in the dark.,Let us celebrate diversity.,Mind your language.,Use it to spread great ideas. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)The story I wanted to share with you today,is my challenge as an Iranian artist,,as an Iranian woman artist,,as an Iranian woman artist,living in exile.,Well, it has its pluses and minuses.,On the dark side,,politics doesn't seem to escape people like me.,Every Iranian artist, in one form or another,,is political.,Politics have defined our lives.,If you're living in Iran,,you're facing censorship, harassment,,arrest, torture --,at times, execution.,If you're living outside like me,,you're faced with life in exile --,the pain of the longing,and the separation from your loved ones,and your family.,Therefore, we don't find,the moral, emotional,,psychological and political space,to distance ourselves from the reality,of social responsibility. 
 Oddly enough,,an artist such as myself,finds herself also in the position of being the voice,,the speaker of my people,,even if I have, indeed,,no access to my own country.,Also, people like myself,,we're fighting two battles on different grounds.,We're being critical of the West,,the perception of the West,about our identity --,about the image that is constructed about us,,about our women, about our politics,,about our religion.,We are there to take pride,and insist on respect.,And at the same time,,we're fighting another battle.,That is our regime,,our government --,our atrocious government,,[that] has done every crime,in order to stay in power.,Our artists are at risk.,We are in a position of danger.,We pose a threat,to the order of the government. 
 But ironically,,this situation,has empowered all of us,,because we are considered, as artists,,central to the cultural, political,,social discourse in Iran.,We are there to inspire, to provoke,,to mobilize,,to bring hope to our people.,We are the reporters of our people,,and are communicators,to the outside world.,Art is our weapon.,Culture is a form of resistance.,I envy sometimes the artists of the West,for their freedom of expression.,For the fact that they can distance themselves,from the question of politics.,From the fact that they are only serving one audience,,mainly the Western culture.,But also, I worry about the West,,because often in this country,,in this Western world that we have,,culture risks being a form of entertainment.,Our people depend on our artists,,and culture is beyond communication. 
 My journey as an artist,started from a very, very personal place.,I did not start,to make social commentary,about my country.,The first one that you see in front of you,is actually when I first returned to Iran,after being separated for a good 12 years.,It was after the Islamic Revolution,of 1979.,While I was absent from Iran,,the Islamic Revolution had descended on Iran,and had entirely transformed the country,from Persian to the Islamic culture.,I came mainly to be reunited with my family,and to reconnect in a way,that I found my place in the society.,But instead, I found a country,that was totally ideological,and that I didn't recognize anymore.,More so, I became very interested,,as I was facing,my own personal dilemmas and questions,,I became immersed in the study,of the Islamic Revolution --,how, indeed,,it had incredibly transformed,the lives of Iranian women.,I found the subject of Iranian women,immensely interesting,,in the way the women of Iran, historically,,seemed to embody the political transformation.,So in a way, by studying a woman,,you can read the structure and the ideology of the country. 
 So I made a group of work,that at once faced my own personal questions in life,,and yet it brought my work into a larger discourse --,the subject of martyrdom,,the question of those who willingly stand in that intersection,of love of God, faith,,but violence and crime and cruelty.,For me, this became incredibly important.,And yet, I had an unusual position toward this.,I was an outsider,who had come back to Iran to find my place,,but I was not in a position,to be critical of the government,or the ideology of the Islamic Revolution.,This changed slowly,as I found my voice,and I discovered things,that I didn't know I would discover.,So my art became slightly more critical.,My knife became a little sharper.,And I fell into a life in exile.,I am a nomadic artist.,I work in Morocco, in Turkey, in Mexico.,I go everywhere to make believe it's Iran. 
 Now I am making films.,Last year, I finished a film,called "Women Without Men.","Women Without Men" returns to history,,but another part of our Iranian history.,It goes to 1953,when American CIA exercised a coup,and removed a democratically elected leader,,Dr. Mossadegh.,The book is written by an Iranian woman,,Shahrnush Parsipur.,It's a magical realist novel.,This book is banned,,and she spent five years in prison.,My obsession with this book,,and the reason I made this into a film,,is because it at once was addressing,the question of being a female --,traditionally, historically in Iran --,and the question of four women,who are all looking for an idea,of change, freedom and democracy --,while the country of Iran, equally, as if another character,,also struggled for an idea,of freedom and democracy,and independence from the foreign interventions. 
 I made this film,because I felt it's important,for it to speak to the Westerners,about our history as a country.,That all of you seem to remember Iran,after the Islamic Revolution.,That Iran was once a secular society,,and we had democracy,,and this democracy was stolen from us,by the American government,,by the British government.,This film also speaks to the Iranian people,in asking them to return to their history,and look at themselves before they were so Islamicized --,in the way we looked, in the way we played music,,in the way we had intellectual life.,And most of all,,in the way that we fought for democracy.,These are some of the shots actually from my film.,These are some of the images of the coup.,And we made this film in Casablanca,,recreating all the shots. 
 This film tried to find a balance,between telling a political story,,but also a feminine story.,Being a visual artist, indeed,,I am foremost interested to make art --,to make art that transcends,politics, religion,,the question of feminism,,and become an important, timeless,,universal work of art.,The challenge I have,is how to do that.,How to tell a political story but an allegorical story.,How to move you with your emotions,,but also make your mind work.,These are some of the images,and the characters of the film.,Now comes the green movement --,the summer of 2009,,as my film is released --,the uprising begins in the streets of Tehran. 
 What is unbelievably ironic,is the period that we tried to depict in the film,,the cry for democracy,and social justice,,repeats itself now,again in Tehran.,The green movement,significantly inspired the world.,It brought a lot of attention to all those Iranians,who stand for basic human rights,and struggle for democracy.,What was most significant for me,was, once again,,the presence of the women.,They're absolutely inspirational for me.,If in the Islamic Revolution,,the images of the woman portrayed,were submissive,and didn't have a voice,,now we saw a new idea of feminism,in the streets of Tehran --,women who were educated,,forward thinking, non-traditional,,sexually open, fearless,and seriously feminist.,These women and those young men,united Iranians,across the world, inside and outside. 
 I then discovered,why I take so much inspiration,from Iranian women.,That, under all circumstances,,they have pushed the boundary.,They have confronted the authority.,They have broken every rule,in the smallest and the biggest way.,And once again, they proved themselves.,I stand here to say,that Iranian women have found a new voice,,and their voice is giving me my voice.,And it's a great honor,to be an Iranian woman and an Iranian artist,,even if I have to operate in the West only for now. 
 Thank you so much. 
 (Applause)My big idea is a very, very small idea,that can unlock billions of big ideas,that are at the moment dormant inside us.,And my little ideanthat will do that is sleep. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 This is a room of type A women.,This is a room of sleep-deprived women.,And I learned the hard waynthe value of sleep.,Two-and-a-half years ago,nI fainted from exhaustion.,I hit my head on my desk.,I broke my cheekbone,nI got five stitches on my right eye.,And I began the journeynof rediscovering the value of sleep.,And in the course of that, I studied,,I met with medical doctors, scientists,,and I'm here to tell you,that the way to a more productive,nmore inspired, more joyful life,is getting enough sleep. 
 (Applause) 
 And we women are going to lead the way,in this new revolution,nthis new feminist issue.,We are literally going to sleepnour way to the top -- literally -- 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 because unfortunately, for men,,sleep deprivation has becomena virility symbol.,I was recently having dinner with a guy,who bragged that he had only gottennfour hours sleep the night before.,And I felt like saying to him --nbut I didn't say --,I felt like saying, "You know what?nif you had gotten five,,this dinner would have beenna lot more interesting." 
 (Laughter) 
 There is now a kindnof sleep deprivation one-upmanship.,Especially here in Washington,nif you try to make a breakfast date,,and you say, "How about eight o'clock?",they're likely to tell you,n"Eight o'clock is too late for me,,but that's OK, I can getna game of tennis in,and do a few conference callsnand meet you at eight.",And they think that means they arenso incredibly busy and productive,,but the truth is, they're not,,because we, at the moment,,have had brilliant leadersnin business, in finance, in politics,,making terrible decisions.,So a high IQ does not meannthat you're a good leader,,because the essence of leadershipnis being able to see the iceberg,before it hits the Titanic. 
 (Laughter) 
 And we've had far too many icebergsnhitting our Titanics.,In fact, I have a feeling,that if Lehman Brothersnwas Lehman Brothers and Sisters,,they might still be around. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 While all the brothers were busynjust being hyper-connected 24/7,,maybe a sister would havennoticed the iceberg,,because she would have woken up,from a seven-and-a-half-nor eight-hour sleep,,and have been able to see the big picture. 
 So as we are facingnall the multiple crises,in our world at the moment,,what is good for us on a personal level,,what's going to bring more joy,ngratitude, effectiveness in our lives,and be the best for our own careers,,is also what is best for the world.,So I urge you to shut your eyes,,and discover the great ideasnthat lie inside us;,to shut your enginesnand discover the power of sleep. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)We are now going through an amazing and unprecedented moment,where the power dynamics between men and women,are shifting very rapidly,,and in many of the places where it counts the most,,women are, in fact, taking control of everything.,In my mother's day, she didn't go to college.,Not a lot of women did.,And now, for every two men who get a college degree,,three women will do the same.,Women, for the first time this year,,became the majority of the American workforce.,And they're starting to dominate lots of professions --,doctors, lawyers,,bankers, accountants.,Over 50 percent of managers are women these days,,and in the 15 professions,projected to grow the most in the next decade,,all but two of them are dominated by women.,So the global economy is becoming a place,where women are more successful than men,,believe it or not,,and these economic changes,are starting to rapidly affect our culture --,what our romantic comedies look like,,what our marriages look like,,what our dating lives look like,,and our new set of superheroes. 
 For a long time, this is the image of American manhood that dominated --,tough, rugged,,in control of his own environment.,A few years ago, the Marlboro Man was retired,and replaced by this,much less impressive specimen,,who is a parody of American manhood,,and that's what we have in our commercials today.,The phrase "first-born son",is so deeply ingrained in our consciousness,that this statistic alone shocked me.,In American fertility clinics,,75 percent of couples,are requesting girls and not boys.,And in places where you wouldn't think,,such as South Korea, India and China,,the very strict patriarchal societies,are starting to break down a little,,and families are no longer,strongly preferring first-born sons. 
 If you think about this, if you just open your eyes to this possibility,and start to connect the dots,,you can see the evidence everywhere.,You can see it in college graduation patterns,,in job projections,,in our marriage statistics,,you can see it in the Icelandic elections, which you'll hear about later,,and you can see it on South Korean surveys on son preference,,that something amazing and unprecedented,is happening with women.,Certainly this is not the first time that we've had great progress with women.,The '20s and the '60s also come to mind.,But the difference is that, back then,,it was driven by a very passionate feminist movement,that was trying to project its own desires,,whereas this time, it's not about passion,,and it's not about any kind of movement.,This is really just about the facts,of this economic moment that we live in.,The 200,000-year period,in which men have been top dog,is truly coming to an end, believe it or not,,and that's why I talk about the "end of men." 
 Now all you men out there,,this is not the moment where you tune out or throw some tomatoes,,because the point is that this,is happening to all of us.,I myself have a husband and a father,and two sons whom I dearly love.,And this is why I like to talk about this,,because if we don't acknowledge it,,then the transition will be pretty painful.,But if we do take account of it,,then I think it will go much more smoothly.,I first started thinking about this about a year and a half ago.,I was reading headlines about the recession just like anyone else,,and I started to notice a distinct pattern --,that the recession was affecting men,much more deeply than it was affecting women.,And I remembered back to about 10 years ago,when I read a book by Susan Faludi,called "Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man,",in which she described how hard the recession had hit men,,and I started to think about,whether it had gotten worse this time around in this recession.,And I realized that two things were different this time around.,The first was that,these were no longer just temporary hits,that the recession was giving men --,that this was reflecting a deeper,underlying shift in our global economy.,And second, that the story was no longer,just about the crisis of men,,but it was also about what was happening to women. 
 And now look at this second set of slides.,These are headlines about what's been going on with women in the next few years.,These are things we never could have imagined a few years ago.,Women, a majority of the workplace.,And labor statistics: women take up most managerial jobs.,This second set of headlines --,you can see that families and marriages are starting to shift.,And look at that last headline --,young women earning more than young men.,That particular headline comes to me from a market research firm.,They were basically asked by one of their clients,who was going to buy houses in that neighborhood in the future.,And they expected that it would be young families,,or young men, just like it had always been.,But in fact, they found something very surprising.,It was young, single women,who were the major purchasers of houses in the neighborhood.,And so they decided, because they were intrigued by this finding,,to do a nationwide survey.,So they spread out all the census data,,and what they found, the guy described to me as a shocker,,which is that in 1,997,out of 2,000 communities,,women, young women,,were making more money than young men.,So here you have a generation of young women,who grow up thinking of themselves,as being more powerful earners,than the young men around them. 
 Now, I've just laid out the picture for you,,but I still haven't explained to you why this is happening.,And in a moment, I'm going to show you a graph,,and what you'll see on this graph --,it begins in 1973,,just before women start flooding the workforce,,and it brings us up to our current day.,And basically what you'll see,is what economists talk about,as the polarization of the economy.,Now what does that mean?,It means that the economy is dividing into high-skill, high-wage jobs,and low-skill, low-wage jobs --,and that the middle, the middle-skill jobs,,and the middle-earning jobs, are starting to drop out of the economy.,This has been going on for 40 years now.,But this process is affecting men,very differently than it's affecting women.,You'll see the women in red, and you'll see the men in blue.,You'll watch them both drop out of the middle class,,but see what happens to women and see what happens to men.,There we go.,So watch that. You see them both drop out of the middle class.,Watch what happens to the women. Watch what happens to the men.,The men sort of stagnate there,,while the women zoom up in those high-skill jobs.,So what's that about?,It looks like women got some power boost on a video game,,or like they snuck in some secret serum into their birth-control pills,that lets them shoot up high.,But of course, it's not about that. 
 What it's about is that the economy has changed a lot.,We used to have a manufacturing economy,,which was about building goods and products,,and now we have a service economy,and an information and creative economy.,Those two economies require very different skills,,and as it happens, women have been much better,at acquiring the new set of skills than men have been.,It used to be that you were,a guy who went to high school,who didn't have a college degree,,but you had a specific set of skills,,and with the help of a union,,you could make yourself a pretty good middle-class life.,But that really isn't true anymore.,This new economy is pretty indifferent,to size and strength,,which is what's helped men along all these years.,What the economy requires now,is a whole different set of skills.,You basically need intelligence,,you need an ability to sit still and focus,,to communicate openly,,to be able to listen to people,and to operate in a workplace that is much more fluid than it used to be,,and those are things that women do extremely well,,as we're seeing. 
 If you look at management theory these days,,it used to be that our ideal leader,sounded something like General Patton, right?,You would be issuing orders from above.,You would be very hierarchical.,You would tell everyone below you what to do.,But that's not what an ideal leader is like now.,If you read management books now,,a leader is somebody who can foster creativity,,who can get his -- get the employees -- see, I still say "his" --,who can get the employees to talk to each other,,who can basically build teams and get them to be creative.,And those are all things that women do very well. 
 And then on top of that, that's created a kind of cascading effect.,Women enter the workplace at the top,,and then at the working class,,all the new jobs that are created,are the kinds of jobs that wives used to do for free at home.,So that's childcare,,elder care and food preparation.,So those are all the jobs that are growing,,and those are jobs that women tend to do.,Now one day it might be,that mothers will hire an out-of-work,,middle-aged, former steelworker guy,to watch their children at home,,and that would be good for the men, but that hasn't quite happened yet. 
 To see what's going to happen, you can't just look at the workforce that is now,,you have to look at our future workforce.,And here the story is fairly simple.,Women are getting college degrees,at a faster rate than men.,Why? This is a real mystery.,People have asked men, why don't they just go back to college,,to community college, say, and retool themselves,,learn a new set of skills?,Well it turns out that they're just very uncomfortable doing that.,They're used to thinking of themselves as providers,,and they can't seem to build the social networks,that allow them to get through college.,So for some reason,men just don't end up going back to college.,And what's even more disturbing,is what's happening with younger boys.,There's been about a decade of research,about what people are calling the "boy crisis.",Now the boy crisis is this idea,that very young boys, for whatever reason,,are doing worse in school than very young girls,,and people have theories about that.,Is it because we have an excessively verbal curriculum,,and little girls are better at that than little boys?,Or that we require kids to sit still too much,,and so boys initially feel like failures?,And some people say it's because,,in 9th grade, boys start dropping out of school.,Because I'm writing a book about all this, I'm still looking into it,,so I don't have the answer.,But in the mean time, I'm going to call on the worldwide education expert,,who's my 10-year-old daughter, Noa,,to talk to you about,why the boys in her class do worse. 
 (Video) Noa: The girls are obviously smarter.,I mean they have much larger vocabulary.,They learn much faster.,They are more controlled.,On the board today for losing recess tomorrow, only boys. 
 Hanna Rosin: And why is that? 
 Noa: Why? They were just not listening to the class,while the girls sat there very nicely. 
 HR: So there you go.,This whole thesis really came home to me,when I went to visit a college in Kansas City --,working-class college.,Certainly, when I was in college, I had certain expectations about my life --,that my husband and I would both work,,and that we would equally raise the children.,But these college girls,had a completely different view of their future.,Basically, the way they said it to me is,that they would be working 18 hours a day,,that their husband would maybe have a job,,but that mostly he would be at home taking care of the kiddies.,And this was kind of a shocker to me.,And then here's my favorite quote from one of the girls:,"Men are the new ball and chain." 
 (Laughter) 
 Now you laugh,,but that quote has kind of a sting to it, right?,And I think the reason it has a sting,is because thousands of years of history,don't reverse themselves,without a lot of pain,,and that's why I talk about,us all going through this together.,The night after I talked to these college girls,,I also went to a men's group in Kansas,,and these were exactly the kind of victims of the manufacturing economy,which I spoke to you about earlier.,They were men who had been contractors,,or they had been building houses,and they had lost their jobs after the housing boom,,and they were in this group because they were failing to pay their child support.,And the instructor was up there in the class,explaining to them all the ways,in which they had lost their identity in this new age.,He was telling them they no longer had any moral authority,,that nobody needed them for emotional support anymore,,and they were not really the providers.,So who were they?,And this was very disheartening for them.,And what he did was he wrote down on the board,"$85,000,",and he said, "That's her salary,",and then he wrote down "$12,000.","That's your salary.,So who's the man now?" he asked them.,"Who's the damn man?,She's the man now.",And that really sent a shudder through the room.,And that's part of the reason I like to talk about this,,because I think it can be pretty painful,,and we really have to work through it. 
 And the other reason it's kind of urgent,is because it's not just happening in the U.S.,It's happening all over the world.,In India, poor women are learning English,faster than their male counterparts,in order to staff the new call centers,that are growing in India.,In China, a lot of the opening up of private entrepreneurship,is happening because women are starting businesses,,small businesses, faster than men.,And here's my favorite example, which is in South Korea.,Over several decades,,South Korea built one of the most patriarchal societies we know about.,They basically enshrined the second-class status of women,in the civil code.,And if women failed to birth male children,,they were basically treated like domestic servants.,And sometimes family would pray to the spirits to kill off a girl child,so they could have a male child.,But over the '70s and '80s,,the South Korea government decided they wanted to rapidly industrialize,,and so what they did was,,they started to push women into the workforce.,Now they've been asking a question since 1985:,"How strongly do you prefer a first-born son?",And now look at the chart.,That's from 1985 to 2003.,How much do you prefer a first-born son? 
 So you can see that these economic changes,really do have a strong effect on our culture.,Now because we haven't fully processed this information,,it's kind of coming back to us in our pop culture,in these kind of weird and exaggerated ways,,where you can see that the stereotypes are changing.,And so we have on the male side,what one of my colleagues likes to call the "omega males" popping up,,who are the males who are romantically challenged losers,who can't find a job.,And they come up in lots of different forms.,So we have the perpetual adolescent.,We have the charmless misanthrope.,Then we have our Bud Light guy,who's the happy couch potato.,And then here's a shocker: even America's most sexiest man alive,,the sexiest man alive,gets romantically played these days in a movie.,And then on the female side, you have the opposite,,in which you have these crazy superhero women.,You've got Lady Gaga.,You've got our new James Bond, who's Angelina Jolie.,And it's not just for the young, right?,Even Helen Mirren can hold a gun these days.,And so it feels like we have to move from this place,where we've got these uber-exaggerated images,into something that feels a little more normal. 
 So for a long time in the economic sphere,,we've lived with the term "glass ceiling.",Now I've never really liked this term.,For one thing, it puts men and women,in a really antagonistic relationship with one another,,because the men are these devious tricksters up there,who've put up this glass ceiling.,And we're always below the glass ceiling, the women.,And we have a lot of skill and experience,,but it's a trick, so how are you supposed to prepare,to get through that glass ceiling?,And also, "shattering the glass ceiling" is a terrible phrase.,What crazy person,would pop their head through a glass ceiling? 
 So the image that I like to think of,,instead of glass ceiling,,is the high bridge.,It's definitely terrifying to stand at the foot of a high bridge,,but it's also pretty exhilarating,,because it's beautiful up there,,and you're looking out on a beautiful view.,And the great thing is there's no trick like with the glass ceiling.,There's no man or woman standing in the middle,about to cut the cables.,There's no hole in the middle that you're going to fall through.,And the great thing is that you can take anyone along with you.,You can bring your husband along.,You can bring your friends, or your colleagues,,or your babysitter to walk along with you.,And husbands can drag their wives across, if their wives don't feel ready.,But the point about the high bridge,is that you have to have the confidence,to know that you deserve to be on that bridge,,that you have all the skills and experience you need,in order to walk across the high bridge,,but you just have to make the decision,to take the first step and do it. 
 Thanks very much. 
 (Applause)(Laughter) 
 I was afraid of womanhood.,Not that I'm not afraid now,,but I've learned to pretend.,I've learned to be flexible.,In fact, I've developed some interesting tools,to help me deal with this fear.,Let me explain.,Back in the '50s and '60s, when I was growing up,,little girls were supposed to be kind and thoughtful,and pretty and gentle and soft,,and we were supposed to fit into roles,that were sort of shadowy --,really not quite clear what we were supposed to be. 
 (Laughter) 
 There were plenty of role models all around us.,We had our mothers, our aunts, our cousins, our sisters,,and of course, the ever-present media,bombarding us with images and words,,telling us how to be.,Now my mother was different.,She was a homemaker,,but she and I didn't go out and do girlie things together,,and she didn't buy me pink outfits.,Instead, she knew what I needed, and she bought me a book of cartoons.,And I just ate it up.,I drew, and I drew,,and since I knew that humor was acceptable in my family,,I could draw, do what I wanted to do,,and not have to perform, not have to speak --,I was very shy --,and I could still get approval.,I was launched as a cartoonist.,Now when we're young,,we don't always know. We know there are rules out there,,but we don't always know --,we don't perform them right,,even though we are imprinted at birth,with these things,,and we're told,what the most important color in the world is.,We're told what shape we're supposed to be in.,(Laughter),We're told what to wear --,(Laughter),-- and how to do our hair --,(Laughter),-- and how to behave. 
 Now the rules that I'm talking about,are constantly being monitored by the culture.,We're being corrected,,and the primary policemen are women,,because we are the carriers of the tradition.,We pass it down from generation to generation.,Not only that --,we always have this vague notion,that something's expected of us.,And on top of all off these rules,,they keep changing.,(Laughter),We don't know what's going on half the time,,so it puts us in a very tenuous position. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now if you don't like these rules,,and many of us don't --,I know I didn't, and I still don't,,even though I follow them half the time,,not quite aware that I'm following them --,what better way than to change them [than] with humor?,Humor relies on the traditions of a society.,It takes what we know, and it twists it.,It takes the codes of behavior and the codes of dress,,and it makes it unexpected,,and that's what elicits a laugh.,Now what if you put together women and humor?,I think you can get change.,Because women are on the ground floor,,and we know the traditions so well,,we can bring a different voice to the table. 
 Now I started drawing,in the middle of a lot of chaos.,I grew up not far from here in Washington D.C.,during the Civil Rights movement, the assassinations,,the Watergate hearings and then the feminist movement,,and I think I was drawing,,trying to figure out what was going on.,And then also my family was in chaos,,and I drew to try to bring my family together --,(Laughter),-- try to bring my family together with laughter.,It didn't work.,My parents got divorced, and my sister was arrested.,But I found my place.,I found that I didn't have to wear high heels,,I didn't have to wear pink,,and I could feel like I fit in. 
 Now when I was a little older, in my 20s,,I realized there are not many women in cartooning.,And I thought, "Well, maybe I can break,the little glass ceiling of cartooning,",and so I did. I became a cartoonist.,And then I thought -- in my 40s I started thinking,,"Well, why don't I do something?,I always loved political cartoons,,so why don't I do something with the content of my cartoons,to make people think about the stupid rules that we're following,as well as laugh?" 
 Now my perspective,is a particularly --,(Laughter),-- my perspective is a particularly American perspective.,I can't help it. I live here.,Even though I've traveled a lot,,I still think like an American woman.,But I believe that the rules that I'm talking about,are universal, of course --,that each culture has its different codes of behavior,and dress and traditions,,and each woman has to deal with these same things,that we do here in the U.S.,Consequently, we have.,Women, because we're on the ground, we know the tradition.,We have amazing antennae. 
 Now my work lately,has been to collaborate with international cartoonists,,which I so enjoy,,and it's given me a greater appreciation,for the power of cartoons,to get at the truth,,to get at the issues quickly and succinctly.,And not only that, it can get to the viewer,through not only the intellect, but through the heart.,My work also has allowed me to collaborate,with women cartoonists from across the world --,countries such as Saudi Arabia,,Iran, Turkey,,Argentina, France --,and we have sat together and laughed,and talked and shared our difficulties.,And these women are working so hard to get their voices heard,in some very difficult circumstances.,But I feel blessed to be able to work with them. 
 And we talk about,how women have such strong perceptions,,because of our tenuous position,and our role as tradition-keepers,,that we can have the great potential,to be change-agents.,And I think, I truly believe,,that we can change this thing,one laugh at a time. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So I was privileged to train in transplantation,under two great surgical pioneers:,Thomas Starzl,,who performed the world's first successful liver transplant,in 1967,,and Sir Roy Calne,,who performed the first liver transplant in the U.K.,in the following year.,I returned to Singapore,and, in 1990,,performed Asia's first successful,cadaveric liver transplant procedure,,but against all odds.,Now when I look back,,the transplant was actually the easiest part.,Next, raising the money to fund the procedure.,But perhaps the most challenging part,was to convince the regulators --,a matter which was debated in the parliament --,that a young female surgeon,be allowed the opportunity,to pioneer for her country.,But 20 years on,,my patient, Surinder,,is Asia's longest surviving,cadaveric liver transplant to date.,(Applause),And perhaps more important,,I am the proud godmother,to her 14 year-old son. 
 (Applause) 
 But not all patients on the transplant wait list,are so fortunate.,The truth is,,there are just simply not enough donor organs,to go around.,As the demand for donor organs,continues to rise,,in large part due to the aging population,,the supply has remained relatively constant.,In the United States alone,,100,000 men, women and children,are on the waiting list for donor organs,,and more than a dozen die each day,because of a lack of donor organs.,The transplant community,has actively campaigned in organ donation.,And the gift of life,has been extended,from brain-dead donors,to living, related donors --,relatives who might donate an organ,or a part of an organ,,like a split liver graft,,to a relative or loved one. 
 But as there was still a dire shortage of donor organs,,the gift of life was then extended,from living, related donors,to now living, unrelated donors.,And this then has given rise,to unprecedented and unexpected,moral controversy.,How can one distinguish,a donation that is voluntary and altruistic,from one that is forced or coerced,from, for example,,a submissive spouse, an in-law,,a servant, a slave,,an employee?,Where and how can we draw the line?,In my part of the world,,too many people live below the poverty line.,And in some areas,,the commercial gifting of an organ,in exchange for monetary reward,has led to a flourishing trade,in living, unrelated donors. 
 Shortly after I performed the first liver transplant,,I received my next assignment,,and that was to go to the prisons,to harvest organs,from executed prisoners.,I was also pregnant at the time.,Pregnancies are meant,to be happy and fulfilling moments,in any woman's life.,But my joyful period,was marred by solemn and morbid thoughts --,thoughts of walking through,the prison's high-security death row,,as this was the only route,to take me to the makeshift operating room.,And at each time,,I would feel the chilling stares,of condemned prisoners' eyes follow me.,And for two years,,I struggled with the dilemma,of waking up at 4:30 am,on a Friday morning,,driving to the prison,,getting down, gloved and scrubbed,,ready to receive the body,of an executed prisoner,,remove the organs,and then transport these organs,to the recipient hospital,and then graft the gift of life,to a recipient the same afternoon.,No doubt, I was informed,,the consent had been obtained. 
 But, in my life,,the one fulfilling skill that I had,was now invoking feelings of conflict --,conflict ranging,from extreme sorrow and doubt at dawn,to celebratory joy,at engrafting the gift of life at dusk.,In my team,,the lives of one or two of my colleagues,were tainted by this experience.,Some of us may have been sublimated,,but really none of us remained the same.,I was troubled,that the retrieval of organs from executed prisoners,was at least as morally controversial,as the harvesting of stem cells,from human embryos.,And in my mind,,I realized as a surgical pioneer,that the purpose of my position of influence,was surely to speak up,for those who have no influence.,It made me wonder,if there could be a better way --,a way to circumvent death,and yet deliver the gift of life,that might exponentially impact,millions of patients worldwide. 
 Now just about that time,,the practice of surgery evolved,from big to small,,from wide open incisions,to keyhole procedures,,tiny incisions.,And in transplantation, concepts shifted,from whole organs to cells.,In 1988, at the University of Minnesota,,I participated in a small series,of whole organ pancreas transplants.,I witnessed the technical difficulty.,And this inspired in my mind,a shift from transplanting whole organs,to perhaps transplanting cells.,I thought to myself,,why not take the individual cells,out of the pancreas --,the cells that secrete insulin to cure diabetes --,and transplant these cells? --,technically a much simpler procedure,than having to grapple with the complexities,of transplanting a whole organ. 
 And at that time,,stem cell research,had gained momentum,,following the isolation of the world's first,human embryonic stem cells,in the 1990s.,The observation that stem cells, as master cells,,could give rise,to a whole variety of different cell types --,heart cells, liver cells,,pancreatic islet cells --,captured the attention of the media,and the imagination of the public.,I too was fascinated,by this new and disruptive cell technology,,and this inspired a shift in my mindset,,from transplanting whole organs,to transplanting cells.,And I focused my research on stem cells,as a possible source,for cell transplants. 
 Today we realize,that there are many different types of stem cells.,Embryonic stem cells,have occupied center stage,,chiefly because of their pluripotency --,that is their ease in differentiating,into a variety of different cell types.,But the moral controversy,surrounding embryonic stem cells --,the fact that these cells are derived,from five-day old human embryos --,has encouraged research,into other types of stem cells. 
 Now to the ridicule of my colleagues,,I inspired my lab,to focus on what I thought,was the most non-controversial source of stem cells,,adipose tissue, or fat, yes fat --,nowadays available in abundant supply --,you and I, I think, would be very happy to get rid of anyway.,Fat-derived stem cells,are adult stem cells.,And adult stem cells,are found in you and me --,in our blood, in our bone marrow,,in our fat, our skin and other organs.,And as it turns out,,fat is one of the best sources,of adult stem cells.,But adult stem cells,are not embryonic stem cells.,And here is the limitation:,adult stem cells are mature cells,,and, like mature human beings,,these cells are more restricted in their thought,and more restricted in their behavior,and are unable to give rise,to the wide variety of specialized cell types,,as embryonic stem cells [can]. 
 But in 2007,,two remarkable individuals,,Shinya Yamanaka of Japan,and Jamie Thomson of the United States,,made an astounding discovery.,They discovered,that adult cells, taken from you and me,,could be reprogrammed,back into embryonic-like cells,,which they termed IPS cells,,or induced pluripotent stem cells.,And so guess what,,scientists around the world and in the labs,are racing,to convert aging adult cells --,aging adult cells from you and me --,they are racing to reprogram these cells,back into more useful IPS cells.,And in our lab,,we are focused on taking fat,and reprogramming,mounds of fat,into fountains of youthful cells --,cells that we may use,to then form other,,more specialized, cells,,which one day may be used as cell transplants.,If this research is successful,,it may then reduce the need,to research and sacrifice,human embryos. 
 Indeed, there is a lot of hype, but also hope,that the promise of stem cells,will one day provide cures,for a whole range of conditions.,Heart disease, stroke, diabetes,,spinal cord injury, muscular dystrophy,,retinal eye diseases --,are any of these conditions,relevant, personally, to you? 
 In May 2006,,something horrible happened to me.,I was about to start a robotic operation,,but stepping out of the elevator,into the bright and glaring lights of the operating room,,I realized,that my left visual field,was fast collapsing into darkness.,Earlier that week,,I had taken a rather hard knock,during late spring skiing -- yes, I fell.,And I started to see floaters and stars,,which I casually dismissed,as too much high-altitude sun exposure.,What happened to me,might have been catastrophic,,if not for the fact,that I was in reach of good surgical access.,And I had my vision restored,,but not before a prolonged period of convalescence --,three months --,in a head down position.,This experience,taught me to empathize more with my patients,,and especially those with retinal diseases. 
 37 million people worldwide,are blind,,and 127 million more,suffer from impaired vision.,Stem cell-derived retinal transplants,,now in a research phase,,may one day restore vision,,or part vision,,to millions of patients with retinal diseases worldwide.,Indeed, we live,in both challenging,as well as exciting times.,As the world population ages,,scientists are racing,to discover new ways,to enhance the power of the body,to heal itself through stem cells. 
 It is a fact,that when our organs or tissues are injured,,our bone marrow,releases stem cells,into our circulation.,And these stem cells,then float in the bloodstream,and hone in to damaged organs,to release growth factors,to repair the damaged tissue.,Stem cells may be used as building blocks,to repair damaged scaffolds within our body,,or to provide new liver cells,to repair damaged liver.,As we speak, there are 117 or so clinical trials,researching the use of stem cells,for liver diseases. 
 What lies ahead?,Heart disease,is the leading cause of death worldwide.,1.1 million Americans,suffer heart attacks yearly.,4.8 million,suffer cardiac failure.,Stem cells may be used,to deliver growth factors,to repair damaged heart muscle,or be differentiated,into heart muscle cells,to restore heart function.,There are 170 clinical trials,investigating the role of stem cells in heart disease.,While still in a research phase,,stem cells may one day herald,a quantum leap in the field of cardiology. 
 Stem cells provide hope for new beginnings --,small, incremental steps,,cells rather than organs,,repair rather than replacement.,Stem cell therapies,may one day reduce the need for donor organs.,Powerful new technologies,always present enigmas.,As we speak,,the world's first human embryonic stem cell trial for spinal cord injury,is currently underway,following the USFDA approval.,And in the U.K.,,neural stem cells to treat stroke,are being investigated in a phase one trial. 
 The research success that we celebrate today,has been made possible,by the curiosity and contribution and commitment,of individual scientists,and medical pioneers.,Each one has his story.,My story has been about my journey,from organs to cells --,a journey through controversy,,inspired by hope --,hope that, as we age,,you and I may one day celebrate longevity,with an improved quality of life. 
 Thank you.I grew up in New York City,,between Harlem and the Bronx.,Growing up as a boy, we were taught,that men had to be tough, had to be strong,,had to be courageous, dominating --,no pain, no emotions,,with the exception of anger --,and definitely no fear;,that men are in charge,,which means women are not;,that men lead,,and you should just follow and do what we say;,that men are superior; women are inferior;,that men are strong; women are weak;,that women are of less value,,property of men,,and objects,,particularly sexual objects.,I've later come to know that to be,the collective socialization of men,,better known,as the "man box.",See this man box has in it,all the ingredients,of how we define what it means to be a man.,Now I also want to say, without a doubt,,there are some wonderful, wonderful,,absolutely wonderful things,about being a man.,But at the same time,,there's some stuff,that's just straight up twisted,,and we really need to begin,to challenge, look at it,and really get in the process,of deconstructing, redefining,,what we come to know as manhood. 
 This is my two at home, Kendall and Jay.,They're 11 and 12.,Kendall's 15 months older than Jay.,There was a period of time when my wife -- her name is Tammie -- and I,,we just got real busy and whip, bam, boom:,Kendall and Jay.,(Laughter),And when they were about five and six,,four and five,,Jay could come to me,,come to me crying.,It didn't matter what she was crying about,,she could get on my knee, she could snot my sleeve up,,just cry, cry it out.,Daddy's got you. That's all that's important. 
 Now Kendall on the other hand --,and like I said, he's only 15 months older than her --,he'd come to me crying,,it's like as soon as I would hear him cry,,a clock would go off.,I would give the boy probably about 30 seconds,,which means, by the time he got to me,,I was already saying things like, "Why are you crying?,Hold your head up. Look at me.,Explain to me what's wrong.,Tell me what's wrong. I can't understand you.,Why are you crying?",And out of my own frustration,of my role and responsibility,of building him up as a man,to fit into these guidelines,and these structures that are defining this man box,,I would find myself saying things like,,"Just go in your room.,Just go on, go on in your room.,Sit down,,get yourself together,and come back and talk to me,when you can talk to me like a --" what?,(Audience: Man.),Like a man.,And he's five years old.,And as I grow in life,,I would say to myself,,"My God, what's wrong with me?,What am I doing? Why would I do this?",And I think back.,I think back to my father. 
 There was a time in my life,where we had a very troubled experience in our family.,My brother, Henry, he died tragically,when we were teenagers.,We lived in New York City, as I said.,We lived in the Bronx at the time,,and the burial was in a place called Long Island,,it was about two hours outside of the city.,And as we were preparing,to come back from the burial,,the cars stopped at the bathroom,to let folks take care of themselves,before the long ride back to the city.,And the limousine empties out.,My mother, my sister, my auntie, they all get out,,but my father and I stayed in the limousine,,and no sooner than the women got out,,he burst out crying.,He didn't want cry in front of me,,but he knew he wasn't going to make it back to the city,,and it was better me than to allow himself,to express these feelings and emotions in front of the women.,And this is a man,who, 10 minutes ago,,had just put his teenage son,in the ground --,something I just can't even imagine.,The thing that sticks with me the most,is that he was apologizing to me,for crying in front of me,,and at the same time, he was also giving me props,,lifting me up,,for not crying. 
 I come to also look at this,as this fear that we have as men,,this fear that just has us paralyzed,,holding us hostage,to this man box.,I can remember speaking,to a 12-year-old boy, a football player,,and I asked him, I said,,"How would you feel if,,in front of all the players,,your coach told you you were playing like a girl?",Now I expected him to say something like,,I'd be sad; I'd be mad; I'd be angry, or something like that.,No, the boy said to me --,the boy said to me,,"It would destroy me.",And I said to myself,,"God, if it would destroy him,to be called a girl,,what are we then teaching him,about girls?" 
 (Applause) 
 It took me back to a time,when I was about 12 years old.,I grew up in tenement buildings in the inner city.,At this time we're living in the Bronx,,and in the building next to where I lived there was a guy named Johnny.,He was about 16 years old,,and we were all about 12 years old -- younger guys.,And he was hanging out with all us younger guys.,And this guy, he was up to a lot of no good.,He was the kind of kid who parents would have to wonder,,"What is this 16-year-old boy doing with these 12-year-old boys?",And he did spend a lot of time up to no good.,He was a troubled kid.,His mother had died from a heroin overdose.,He was being raised by his grandmother.,His father wasn't on the set.,His grandmother had two jobs.,He was home alone a lot.,But I've got to tell you, we young guys,,we looked up to this dude, man.,He was cool. He was fine.,That's what the sisters said, "He was fine.",He was having sex.,We all looked up to him. 
 So one day, I'm out in front of the house doing something --,just playing around, doing something -- I don't know what.,He looks out his window; he calls me upstairs; he said, "Hey Anthony.",They called me Anthony growing up as a kid.,"Hey Anthony, come on upstairs.",Johnny call, you go.,So I run right upstairs.,As he opens the door, he says to me, "Do you want some?",Now I immediately knew what he meant.,Because for me growing up at that time,,and our relationship with this man box,,"Do you want some?" meant one of two things:,sex or drugs --,and we weren't doing drugs.,Now my box, my card,,my man box card,,was immediately in jeopardy.,Two things: One, I never had sex.,We don't talk about that as men.,You only tell your dearest, closest friend, sworn to secrecy for life,,the first time you had sex.,For everybody else, we go around like we've been having sex since we were two.,There ain't no first time.,(Laughter),The other thing I couldn't tell him is that I didn't want any.,That's even worse. We're supposed to always be on the prowl.,Women are objects,,especially sexual objects. 
 Anyway, so I couldn't tell him any of that.,So, like my mother would say, make a long story short,,I just simply said to Johnny, "Yes.",He told me to go in his room.,I go in his room. On his bed is a girl from the neighborhood named Sheila.,She's 16 years old.,She's nude.,She's what I know today to be mentally ill,,higher-functioning at times than others.,We had a whole choice of inappropriate names for her.,Anyway, Johnny had just gotten through having sex with her.,Well actually, he raped her, but he would say he had sex with her.,Because, while Sheila never said no,,she also never said yes. 
 So he was offering me the opportunity to do the same.,So when I go in the room, I close the door.,Folks, I'm petrified.,I stand with my back to the door so Johnny can't bust in the room,and see that I'm not doing anything,,and I stand there long enough that I could have actually done something.,So now I'm no longer trying to figure out what I'm going to do;,I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to get out of this room.,So in my 12 years of wisdom,,I zip my pants down,,I walk out into the room,,and lo and behold to me,,while I was in the room with Sheila,,Johnny was back at the window calling guys up.,So now there's a living room full of guys.,It was like the waiting room in the doctor's office.,And they asked me how was it,,and I say to them, "It was good,",and I zip my pants up in front of them,,and I head for the door. 
 Now I say this all with remorse,,and I was feeling a tremendous amount of remorse at that time,,but I was conflicted, because, while I was feeling remorse, I was excited,,because I didn't get caught.,But I knew I felt bad about what was happening.,This fear, getting outside the man box,,totally enveloped me.,It was way more important to me,,about me and my man box card,than about Sheila,and what was happening to her. 
 See collectively, we as men,are taught to have less value in women,,to view them as property and the objects of men.,We see that as an equation that equals violence against women.,We as men, good men,,the large majority of men,,we operate on the foundation,of this whole collective socialization.,We kind of see ourselves separate, but we're very much a part of it.,You see, we have to come to understand,that less value, property and objectification is the foundation,and the violence can't happen without it.,So we're very much a part of the solution,as well as the problem.,The center for disease control says,that men's violence against women is at epidemic proportions,,is the number one health concern for women,in this country and abroad. 
 So quickly, I'd like to just say,,this is the love of my life, my daughter Jay.,The world I envision for her --,how do I want men to be acting and behaving?,I need you on board. I need you with me.,I need you working with me and me working with you,on how we raise our sons,and teach them to be men --,that it's okay to not be dominating,,that it's okay to have feelings and emotions,,that it's okay to promote equality,,that it's okay to have women who are just friends and that's it,,that it's okay to be whole,,that my liberation as a man,is tied to your liberation as a woman. (Applause) 
 I remember asking a nine-year-old boy,,I asked a nine-year-old boy,,"What would life be like for you,,if you didn't have to adhere to this man box?",He said to me, "I would be free." 
 Thank you folks. 
 (Applause)(Applause) 
 (Music) 
 (Applause) 
 Angella Ahn: Thank you.,(Applause),Thank you so much.,We are so honored to be here at TEDWomen,,sharing our music with you.,What an exciting and inspiring event.,What you just heard is "Skylife" by David Balakrishnan.,We want to play you one more selection.,It's by Astor Piazzolla, an Argentine composer.,And we talk about different ideas --,he had this idea,that he thought music should be from the heart.,This was in the middle of the 20th century,when music from the heart, beautiful music,,wasn't the most popular thing in the classical music world.,It was more atonal and twelve-tone.,And he insisted on beautiful music.,So this is "Oblivion" by Astor Piazzolla. 
 Thank you. 
 (Music),(Applause)I would like to tell you all,that you are all actually cyborgs,,but not the cyborgs that you think.,You're not RoboCop, and you're not Terminator,,but you're cyborgs every time you look at a computer screen,or use one of your cell phone devices.,So what's a good definition for cyborg?,Well, traditional definition is "an organism,to which exogenous components have been added,for the purpose of adapting to new environments.",That came from a 1960 paper on space travel,,because, if you think about it, space is pretty awkward.,People aren't supposed to be there.,But humans are curious, and they like to add things to their bodies,so they can go to the Alps one day,and then become a fish in the sea the next. 
 So let's look at the concept of traditional anthropology.,Somebody goes to another country,,says, "How fascinating these people are, how interesting their tools are,,how curious their culture is.",And then they write a paper, and maybe a few other anthropologists read it,,and we think it's very exotic.,Well, what's happening,is that we've suddenly found a new species.,I, as a cyborg anthropologist, have suddenly said,,"Oh, wow. Now suddenly we're a new form of Homo sapiens,,and look at these fascinating cultures,,and look at these curious rituals,that everybody's doing around this technology.,They're clicking on things and staring at screens." 
 Now there's a reason why I study this,,versus traditional anthropology.,And the reason is that tool use,,in the beginning -- for thousands and thousands of years,,everything has been a physical modification of self.,It has helped us to extend our physical selves,,go faster, hit things harder,,and there's been a limit on that.,But now what we're looking at is not an extension of the physical self,,but an extension of the mental self,,and because of that, we're able to travel faster,,communicate differently.,And the other thing that happens,is that we're all carrying around little Mary Poppins technology.,We can put anything we want into it, and it doesn't get heavier,,and then we can take anything out.,What does the inside of your computer actually look like?,Well, if you print it out, it looks like a thousand pounds of material,that you're carrying around all the time.,And if you actually lose that information,,it means that you suddenly have this loss in your mind,,that you suddenly feel like something's missing,,except you aren't able to see it, so it feels like a very strange emotion. 
 The other thing that happens is that you have a second self.,Whether you like it or not, you're starting to show up online,,and people are interacting with your second self,when you're not there.,And so you have to be careful,about leaving your front lawn open,,which is basically your Facebook wall,,so that people don't write on it in the middle of the night --,because it's very much the equivalent.,And suddenly we have to start to maintain our second self.,You have to present yourself in digital life,in a similar way that you would in your analog life.,So, in the same way that you wake up, take a shower and get dressed,,you have to learn to do that for your digital self.,And the problem is that a lot of people now,,especially adolescents,,have to go through two adolescences.,They have to go through their primary one, that's already awkward,,and then they go through their second self's adolescence,,and that's even more awkward,because there's an actual history,of what they've gone through online.,And anybody coming in new to technology,is an adolescent online right now,,and so it's very awkward,,and it's very difficult for them to do those things. 
 So when I was little, my dad would sit me down at night and he would say,,"I'm going to teach you about time and space in the future.",And I said, "Great.",And he said one day, "What's the shortest distance between two points?",And I said, "Well, that's a straight line. You told me that yesterday.",I thought I was very clever.,He said, "No, no, no. Here's a better way.",He took a piece of paper,,drew A and B on one side and the other,and folded them together so where A and B touched.,And he said, "That is the shortest distance between two points.",And I said, "Dad, dad, dad, how do you do that?",He said, "Well, you just bend time and space,,it takes an awful lot of energy,,and that's just how you do it.",And I said, "I want to do that.",And he said, "Well, okay.",And so, when I went to sleep for the next 10 or 20 years,,I was thinking at night,,"I want to be the first person to create a wormhole,,to make things accelerate faster.,And I want to make a time machine.",I was always sending messages to my future self,using tape recorders. 
 But then what I realized when I went to college,is that technology doesn't just get adopted,because it works.,It gets adopted because people use it,and it's made for humans.,So I started studying anthropology.,And when I was writing my thesis on cell phones,,I realized that everyone was carrying around wormholes in their pockets.,They weren't physically transporting themselves;,they were mentally transporting themselves.,They would click on a button,,and they would be connected as A to B immediately.,And I thought, "Oh, wow. I found it. This is great." 
 So over time, time and space,have compressed because of this.,You can stand on one side of the world,,whisper something and be heard on the other.,One of the other ideas that comes around,is that you have a different type of time on every single device that you use.,Every single browser tab gives you a different type of time.,And because of that, you start to dig around,for your external memories -- where did you leave them?,So now we're all these paleontologists,that are digging for things that we've lost,on our external brains that we're carrying around in our pockets.,And that incites a sort of panic architecture --,"Oh no, where's this thing?",We're all "I Love Lucy" on a great assembly line of information,,and we can't keep up. 
 And so what happens is,,when we bring all that into the social space,,we end up checking our phones all the time.,So we have this thing called ambient intimacy.,It's not that we're always connected to everybody,,but at anytime we can connect to anyone we want.,And if you were able to print out everybody in your cell phone,,the room would be very crowded.,These are the people that you have access to right now, in general --,all of these people, all of your friends and family that you can connect to. 
 And so there are some psychological effects that happen with this.,One I'm really worried about,is that people aren't taking time for mental reflection anymore,,and that they aren't slowing down and stopping,,being around all those people in the room all the time,that are trying to compete for their attention,on the simultaneous time interfaces,,paleontology and panic architecture.,They're not just sitting there.,And really, when you have no external input,,that is a time when there is a creation of self,,when you can do long-term planning,,when you can try and figure out who you really are.,And then, once you do that, you can figure out,how to present your second self in a legitimate way,,instead of just dealing with everything as it comes in --,and oh, I have to do this, and I have to do this, and I have to do this.,And so this is very important.,I'm really worried that, especially kids today,,they're not going to be dealing with this down-time,,that they have an instantaneous button-clicking culture,,and that everything comes to them,,and that they become very excited about it and very addicted to it. 
 So if you think about it, the world hasn't stopped either.,It has its own external prosthetic devices,,and these devices are helping us all,to communicate and interact with each other.,But when you actually visualize it,,all the connections that we're doing right now --,this is an image of the mapping of the Internet --,it doesn't look technological.,It actually looks very organic.,This is the first time in the entire history of humanity,that we've connected in this way.,And it's not that machines are taking over.,It's that they're helping us to be more human,,helping us to connect with each other. 
 The most successful technology gets out of the way,and helps us live our lives.,And really,,it ends up being more human than technology,,because we're co-creating each other all the time.,And so this is the important point that I like to study:,that things are beautiful, that it's still a human connection --,it's just done in a different way.,We're just increasing our humanness,and our ability to connect with each other, regardless of geography.,So that's why I study cyborg anthropology. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I would like to talk today,about what I think is one of the greatest adventures,human beings have embarked upon,,which is the quest to understand the universe,and our place in it.,My own interest in this subject, and my passion for it,,began rather accidentally.,I had bought a copy of this book,,"The Universe and Dr. Einstein" --,a used paperback from a secondhand bookstore in Seattle.,A few years after that, in Bangalore,,I was finding it hard to fall asleep one night,,and I picked up this book,,thinking it would put me to sleep in 10 minutes.,And as it happened,,I read it from midnight to five in the morning in one shot.,And I was left with this intense feeling,of awe and exhilaration,at the universe,and our own ability to understand as much as we do.,And that feeling hasn't left me yet. 
 That feeling was the trigger for me,to actually change my career --,from being a software engineer to become a science writer --,so that I could partake in the joy of science,,and also the joy of communicating it to others.,And that feeling also led me,to a pilgrimage of sorts,,to go literally to the ends of the earth,to see telescopes, detectors,,instruments that people are building, or have built,,in order to probe the cosmos,in greater and greater detail.,So it took me from places like Chile --,the Atacama Desert in Chile --,to Siberia,,to underground mines,in the Japanese Alps, in Northern America,,all the way to Antarctica,and even to the South Pole. 
 And today I would like to share with you,some images, some stories of these trips.,I have been basically spending the last few years,documenting the efforts,of some extremely intrepid men and women,who are putting,,literally at times, their lives at stake,working in some very remote and very hostile places,so that they may gather the faintest signals from the cosmos,in order for us to understand this universe. 
 And I first begin with a pie chart --,and I promise this is the only pie chart,in the whole presentation --,but it sets up the state of our knowledge of the cosmos.,All the theories in physics that we have today,properly explain what is called normal matter --,the stuff that we're all made of --,and that's four percent of the universe.,Astronomers and cosmologists and physicists think,that there is something called dark matter in the universe,,which makes up 23 percent of the universe,,and something called dark energy,,which permeates the fabric of space-time,,that makes up another 73 percent.,So if you look at this pie chart, 96 percent of the universe,,at this point in our exploration of it,,is unknown or not well understood.,And most of the experiments, telescopes that I went to see,are in some way addressing this question,,these two twin mysteries of dark matter and dark energy. 
 I will take you first to an underground mine,in Northern Minnesota,where people are looking,for something called dark matter.,And the idea here is that they are looking for a sign,of a dark matter particle hitting one of their detectors.,And the reason why they have to go underground,is that, if you did this experiment on the surface of the Earth,,the same experiment would be swamped by signals,that could be created by things like cosmic rays,,ambient radio activity,,even our own bodies. You might not believe it,,but even our own bodies are radioactive enough to disturb this experiment.,So they go deep inside mines,to find a kind of environmental silence,that will allow them to hear,the ping of a dark matter particle hitting their detector. 
 And I went to see one of these experiments,,and this is actually -- you can barely see it,,and the reason for that is it's entirely dark in there --,this is a cavern that was left behind by the miners,who left this mine in 1960.,And physicists came and started using it,sometime in the 1980s.,And the miners in the early part of the last century,worked, literally, in candlelight.,And today, you would see this inside the mine,,half a mile underground.,This is one of the largest underground labs in the world.,And, among other things, they're looking for dark matter. 
 There is another way to search for dark matter,,which is indirectly.,If dark matter exists in our universe,,in our galaxy,,then these particles should be smashing together,and producing other particles that we know about --,one of them being neutrinos.,And neutrinos you can detect,by the signature they leave,when they hit water molecules.,When a neutrino hits a water molecule,it emits a kind of blue light,,a flash of blue light,,and by looking for this blue light,,you can essentially understand something about the neutrino,and then, indirectly, something about the dark matter,that might have created this neutrino.,But you need very, very large volumes of water,in order to do this.,You need something like tens of megatons of water --,almost a gigaton of water --,in order to have any chance of catching this neutrino.,And where in the world would you find such water?,Well the Russians have a tank in their own backyard. 
 This is Lake Baikal.,It is the largest lake in the world. It's 800 km long.,It's about 40 to 50 km wide,in most places,,and one to two kilometers deep.,And what the Russians are doing,is they're building these detectors,and immersing them about a kilometer beneath the surface of the lake,so that they can watch for these flashes of blue light.,And this is the scene that greeted me when I landed there.,This is Lake Baikal,in the peak of the Siberian winter.,The lake is entirely frozen.,And the line of black dots,that you see in the background,,that's the ice camp where the physicists are working.,The reason why they have to work in winter,is because they don't have the money to work in summer and spring,,which, if they did that,,they would need ships and submersibles to do their work.,So they wait until winter --,the lake is completely frozen over --,and they use this meter-thick ice,as a platform on which to establish their ice camp and do their work. 
 So this is the Russians working on the ice,in the peak of the Siberian winter.,They have to drill holes in the ice,,dive down into the water -- cold, cold water --,to get hold of the instrument, bring it up,,do any repairs and maintenance that they need to do,,put it back and get out before the ice melts.,Because that phase of solid ice lasts for two months,and it's full of cracks.,And you have to imagine, there's an entire sea-like lake,underneath, moving.,I still don't understand this one Russian man,working in his bare chest,,but that tells you how hard he was working.,And these people, a handful of people,,have been working for 20 years,,looking for particles that may or may not exist.,And they have dedicated their lives to it.,And just to give you an idea,,they have spent 20 million over 20 years.,It's very harsh conditions.,They work on a shoestring budget.,The toilets there are literally holes in the ground,covered with a wooden shack.,And it's that basic,,but they do this every year. 
 From Siberia to the Atacama Desert in Chile,,to see something called The Very Large Telescope.,The Very Large Telescope,is one of these things that astronomers do --,they name their telescopes rather unimaginatively.,I can tell you for a fact,,that the next one that they're planning is called The Extremely Large Telescope.,(Laughter),And you wouldn't believe it,,but the one after that is going to be called The Overwhelmingly Large Telescope.,But nonetheless,,it's an extraordinary piece of engineering.,These are four 8.2 meter telescopes.,And these telescopes, among other things,,they're being used to study,how the expansion of the universe is changing with time.,And the more you understand that,,the better you would understand,what this dark energy that the universe is made of is all about. 
 And one piece of engineering that I want to leave you with,as regards this telescope,is the mirror.,Each mirror, there are four of them,,is made of a single piece of glass,,a monolithic piece of high-tech ceramic,,that has been ground down and polished to such accuracy,that the only way to understand what that is,is [to] imagine a city like Paris,,with all its buildings and the Eiffel Tower,,if you grind down Paris to that kind of accuracy,,you would be left with bumps that are one millimeter high.,And that's the kind of polishing that these mirrors have endured.,An extraordinary set of telescopes.,Here's another view of the same.,The reason why you have to build these telescopes,in places like the Atacama Desert,is because of the high altitude desert.,The dry air is really good for telescopes,,and also, the cloud cover is below the summit of these mountains,so that the telescopes have,about 300 days of clear skies. 
 Finally, I want to take you to Antarctica.,I want to spend most of my time on this part of the world.,This is cosmology's final frontier.,Some of the most amazing experiments,,some of the most extreme experiments,,are being done in Antarctica.,I was there to view something called a long-duration balloon flight,,which basically takes telescopes and instruments,all the way to the upper atmosphere,,the upper stratosphere, 40 km up.,And that's where they do their experiments,,and then the balloon, the payload, is brought down.,So this is us landing on the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica.,That's an American C-17 cargo plane,that flew us from New Zealand,to McMurdo in Antarctica.,And here we are about to board our bus.,And I don't know if you can read the lettering,,but it says, "Ivan the Terribus.",And that's taking us to McMurdo. 
 And this is the scene that greets you in McMurdo.,And you barely might be able to make out,this hut here.,This hut was built by Robert Falcon Scott and his men,when they first came to Antarctica,on their first expedition to go to the South Pole.,Because it's so cold,,the entire contents of that hut is still as they left it,,with the remnants of the last meal they cooked still there.,It's an extraordinary place.,This is McMurdo itself. About a thousand people work here in summer,,and about 200 in winter,when it's completely dark for six months. 
 I was here to see the launch,of this particular type of instrument.,This is a cosmic ray experiment,that has been launched all the way to the upper-stratosphere,to an altitude of 40 km.,What I want you to imagine is this is two tons in weight.,So you're using a balloon,to carry something that is two tons,all the way to an altitude of 40 km.,And the engineers, the technicians, the physicists,have all got to assemble on the Ross Ice Shelf,,because Antarctica -- I won't go into the reasons why --,but it's one of the most favorable places for doing these balloon launches,,except for the weather.,The weather, as you can imagine,,this is summer, and you're standing on 200 ft of ice.,And there's a volcano behind,,which has glaciers at the very top.,And what they have to do,is they have to assemble the entire balloon --,the fabric, parachute and everything -- on the ice,and then fill it up with helium.,And that process takes about two hours. 
 And the weather can change as they're putting together this whole assembly.,For instance, here they are laying down the balloon fabric behind,,which is eventually going to be filled up with helium.,Those two trucks you see at the very end,carry 12 tanks each of compressed helium.,Now, in case the weather changes before the launch,,they have to actually pack everything back up into their boxes,and take it out back to McMurdo Station.,And this particular balloon,,because it has to launch two tons of weight,,is an extremely huge balloon.,The fabric alone weighs two tons.,In order to minimize the weight,,it's very thin, it's as thin as a sandwich wrapper.,And if they have to pack it back,,they have to put it into boxes,and stamp on it so that it fits into the box again --,except, when they did it first,,it would have been done in Texas.,Here, they can't do it with the kind shoes they're wearing,,so they have to take their shoes off,,get barefoot into the boxes, in this cold,,and do that kind of work.,That's the kind of dedication these people have. 
 Here's the balloon being filled up with helium,,and you can see it's a gorgeous sight.,Here's a scene,that shows you the balloon and the payload end-to-end.,So the balloon is being filled up with helium on the left-hand side,,and the fabric actually runs all the way to the middle,where there's a piece of electronics and explosives,being connected to a parachute,,and then the parachute is then connected to the payload.,And remember, all this wiring is being done,by people in extreme cold, in sub-zero temperatures.,They're wearing about 15 kg of clothing and stuff,,but they have to take their gloves off in order to do that.,And I would like to share with you a launch. 
 (Video) Radio: Okay, release the balloon,,release the balloon, release the balloon. 
 Anil Ananthaswamy: And I'll finally like to leave you with two images.,This is an observatory in the Himalayas, in Ladakh in India.,And the thing I want you to look at here,is the telescope on the right-hand side.,And on the far left there,is a 400 year-old Buddhist monastery.,This is a close-up of the Buddhist monastery.,And I was struck by the juxtaposition,of these two enormous disciplines that humanity has.,One is exploring the cosmos on the outside,,and the other one is exploring our interior being.,And both require silence of some sort. 
 And what struck me was,every place that I went to to see these telescopes,,the astronomers and cosmologists,are in search of a certain kind of silence,,whether it's silence from radio pollution,or light pollution or whatever.,And it was very obvious,that, if we destroy these silent places on Earth,,we will be stuck on a planet without the ability to look outwards,,because we will not be able to understand the signals that come from outer space. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Beverly Joubert: We are truly passionate,about the African wilderness,and protecting the African wilderness,,and so what we've done,is we've focused on iconic cats.,And I know,,in the light of human suffering and poverty,and even climate change,,one would wonder,,why worry about a few cats?,Well today we're here,to share with you a message that we have learned,from a very important and special character --,this leopard. 
 Dereck Joubert: Well, our lives have basically been,like a super long episode of "CSI" --,something like 28 years.,In essence, what we've done,is we've studied the science, we've looked at the behavior,,we've seen over 2,000 kills,by these amazing animals.,But one of the things that science really lets us down on,is that personality,,that individual personality that these animals have.,And here's a prime example.,We found this leopard in a 2,000-year-old,baobab tree in Africa,,the same tree that we found her mother in,and her grandmother.,And she took us on a journey,and revealed something very special to us --,her own daughter, eight days old.,And the minute we found this leopard,,we realized that we needed to move in,,and so we basically stayed with this leopard,for the next four-and-a-half years --,following her every day,,getting to know her,,that individual personality of hers,,and really coming to know her.,Now I'm destined,to spend a lot of time,with some unique,,very, very special,,individualistic,and often seductive female characters.,(Laughter),Beverly's clearly one of them,,and this little leopard, Legadema, is another,,and she changed our lives. 
 BJ: Well we certainly did spend a lot of time with her --,in fact, more time than even her mother did.,When her mother would go off hunting,,we would stay and film.,And early on, a lightning bolt hit a tree,20 paces away from us.,It was frightening,,and it showered us with leaves and a pungent smell.,And of course, we were stunned for a while,,but when we managed to get our wits about us,,we looked at it and said, "My gosh,,what's going to happen with that little cub?,She's probably going to forever associate,that deafening crash with us.",Well, we needn't have worried.,She came charging out of the thicket straight towards us,,sat next to us, shivering,,with her back towards Dereck, and looking out.,And actually from that day on,,she's been comfortable with us.,So we felt that that day,was the day that she really earned her name.,We called her Legadema,,which means, "light from the sky." 
 DJ: Now we've found these individualisms,in all sorts of animals,,in particular in the cats.,This particular one is called Eetwidomayloh,,"he who greets with fire,",and you can just see that about him, you know -- that's his character.,But only by getting up close to these animals,and spending time with them,can we actually even reach out,and dig out these personal characters that they have. 
 BJ: But through our investigation,,we have to seek the wildest places in Africa.,And right now this is in the Okavango Delta,in Botswana.,Yes, it is swamp. We live in the swamp in a tent,,but I must tell you, every day is exhilarating.,But also, our hearts are in our throats,a huge amount of the time,,because we're driving through water,,and it's an unknown territory.,But we're really there,seeking and searching and filming the iconic cats. 
 DJ: Now one of the big things, of course,,everybody knows that cats hate water,,and so this was a real revelation for us.,And we could only find this by pushing ourselves,,by going where no sane person should go --,not without some prompting, by the way, from Beverly --,and just pushing the envelope,,going out there, pushing our vehicle, pushing ourselves.,But we've managed to find that these lions,are 15 percent bigger than any others,,and they specialize in hunting buffalo in the water. 
 BJ: And then of course, the challenge,is knowing when to turn around.,We don't always get that right,,and on this particular day,,we seriously underestimated the depth.,We got deeper and deeper,,until it was at Dereck's chest-height.,Well then we hit a deep depression,,and we seriously submerged the vehicle.,We actually managed to drown,two million dollars' worth of camera gear.,We drowned our pride, I must tell you,,which was really serious,,and we seized the engine. 
 DJ: And of course, one of the rules that we have in the vehicle,is that he who drowns the vehicle,gets to swim with the crocodiles.,(Laughter),You will notice also that all of these images here,are taken from the top angle by Beverly --,the dry top angle, by the way.,(Laughter),But all the places we get stuck in really have great views.,And it wasn't a moment, and these lions came back towards us,,and Beverly was able to get a great photograph. 
 BJ: But we truly do,spend day and night,trying to capture unique footage.,And 20 years ago,,we did a film called "Eternal Enemies",where we managed to capture,this unusual disturbing behavior across two species --,lions and hyenas.,And surprisingly, it became a cult film.,And we can only work that out,as people were seeing parallels,between the thuggish side of nature,and gang warfare. 
 DJ: It was amazing, because you can see that this lion,is doing exactly what his name,,Eetwidomayloh, represents.,He's focused on this hyena,,and he is going to get it.,(Animal sounds),But that's, I think, what this is all about,,is that these individuals have these personalities and characters.,But for us to get them, not only do we push ourselves,,but we live by certain rules of engagement,,which mean we can't interfere.,This sort of behavior has been going on,for three, four, five million years,,and we can't step in and say, "That's wrong, and that's right.",But that's not always easy for us. 
 BJ: So, as Dereck says,,we have to work through extremes --,extreme temperatures, push ourselves at night.,Sleep deprivation is extreme.,We're on the edge,through a large part of the time.,But, for 10 years, we tried to capture,lions and elephants together --,and never ever managed,until this particular night.,And I have to tell you,that it was a disturbing night for me.,I had tears rolling down my cheeks.,I was shaking with anxiety,,but I knew that [I had] to capture something,that had never been seen before, had never been documented.,And I do believe you should stay with us. 
 DJ: The amazing thing about these moments --,and this is probably a highlight of our career --,is that you never know how it's going to end.,Many people believe, in fact,,that death begins in the eyes, not in the heart,,not in the lungs,,and that's when people give up hope,,or when any life form gives up hope.,And you can see the start of it here.,This elephant, against overwhelming odds,,simply gives up hope.,But by the same token,,you can get your hope back again.,So just when you think it's all over, something else happens,,some spark gets into you,,some sort of will to fight --,that iron will that we all have,,that this elephant has,,that conservation has, that big cats have.,Everything has that will to survive,,to fight, to push through that mental barrier,and to keep going.,And for us, in many ways,,this elephant has become,a symbol of inspiration for us,,a symbol of that hope as we go forward in our work. 
 (Applause) 
 Now back to the leopard.,We were spending so much time with this leopard,and getting to understand her individualism,,her personal character,,that maybe we were taking it a little bit far.,We were perhaps taking her for granted,,and maybe she didn't like that that much.,This is about couples working together,,and so I do need to say that within the vehicle,we have quite strict territories, Beverly and I.,Beverly sits on the one side,where all her camera gear is,,and I'm on the other side where my space is.,These are precious to us, these divides. 
 BJ: But when this little cub saw,that I had vacated my seat,and climbed to the back to get some camera gear,,she came in like a curious cat,to come and investigate.,It was phenomenal, and we felt grateful,that she trusted us to that extent.,But at the same time, we were concerned,that if she created this as a habit,and jumped into somebody else's car,,it might not turn out the same way --,she might get shot for that.,So we knew we had to react quickly.,And the only way we thought we could,without scaring her,is to try and simulate a growl like her mother would make --,a hiss and a sound.,So Dereck turned on the heater fan in the car --,very innovative. 
 DJ: It was the only way for me to save the marriage,,because Beverly felt she was being replaced, you see.,(Laughter),But really and truly, this was how,this little leopard was displaying,her individual personality.,But nothing prepared us,for what happened next in our relationship with her,,when she started hunting. 
 BJ: And on this first hunt, we truly were excited.,It was like watching a graduation ceremony.,We felt like we were surrogate parents.,And of course, we knew now,that she was going to survive.,But only when we saw the tiny baby baboon,clinging to the mother's fur,did we realize that something very unique,was taking place here with Legadema.,And of course, the baby baboon was so innocent,,it didn't turn and run.,So what we watched,over the next couple of hours,was very unique.,It was absolutely amazing,when she picked it up to safety,,protecting it from the hyena.,And over the next five hours,,she took care of it.,We realized that we actually don't know everything,,and that nature is so unpredictable,,we have to be open at all times. 
 DJ: Okay, so she was a little bit rough.,(Laughter),But in fact,,what we were seeing here was interesting.,Because she is a cub wanting to play,,but she was also a predator needing to kill,,and yet conflicted in some way,,because she was also an emerging mother.,She had this maternal instinct,,much like a young girl on her way to womanhood,,and so this really took us to this new level,of understanding that personality. 
 BJ: And of course, through the night, they lay together.,They ended up sleeping for hours.,But I have to tell you --,everybody always asks, "What happened to the baby baboon?",It did die,,and we suspect it was from the freezing winter nights. 
 DJ: So at this stage, I guess,,we had very, very firm ideas,on what conservation meant.,We had to deal with these individual personalities.,We had to deal with them with respect,and celebrate them.,And so we, with the National Geographic, formed the Big Cats Initiative,to march forward into conservation,,taking care of the big cats that we loved --,and then had an opportunity to look back over the last 50 years,to see how well we had all collectively been doing.,So when Beverly and I were born,,there were 450,000 lions,,and today there are 20,000.,Tigers haven't fared any better --,45,000,down to maybe 3,000. 
 BJ: And then cheetahs have crashed,all the way down to 12,000.,Leopards have plummeted,from 700,000,down to a mere 50,000.,Now in the extraordinary time,that we have worked with Legadema --,which is really over a five-year period --,10,000 leopards were legally shot,by safari hunters.,And that's not the only leopards,that were being killed through that period.,There's an immense amount of poaching as well,,and so possibly the same amount.,It's simply not sustainable.,We admire them,,and we fear them,,and yet, as man, we want to steal their power.,It used to be the time,where only kings wore a leopard skin,,but now throughout rituals and ceremonies,,traditional healers and ministers.,And of course, looking at this lion paw,that has been skinned,,it eerily reminds me,of a human hand,,and that's ironic, because their fate is in our hands. 
 DJ: There's a burgeoning bone trade.,South Africa just released some lion bones onto the market.,Lion bones and tiger bones look exactly the same,,and so in a stroke, the lion bone industry,is going to wipe out all the tigers.,So we have a real problem here,,no more so than the lions do, the male lions.,So the 20,000 lion figure that you just saw,is actually a red herring,,because there may be 3,000 or 4,000 male lions,,and they all are actually,infected with the same disease.,I call it complacency --,our complacency.,Because there's a sport, there's an activity going on,that we're all aware of, that we condone.,And that's probably because we haven't seen it,like we are today. 
 BJ: And you have to know,that, when a male lion is killed,,it completely disrupts the whole pride.,A new male comes into the area,and takes over the pride,,and, of course, first of all kills all the cubs,and possibly some of the females that are defending their cubs.,So we've estimated,that between 20 [and] 30 lions are killed,when one lion is hanging on a wall,somewhere in a far-off place. 
 DJ: So what our investigations have shown,is that these lions are essential.,They're essential to the habitat.,If they disappear,,whole ecosystems in Africa disappear.,There's an 80-billion-dollar-a-year,ecotourism revenue stream into Africa.,So this is not just a concern about lions;,it's a concern about communities in Africa as well.,If they disappear, all of that goes away.,But what I'm more concerned about in many ways,is that, as we de-link ourselves from nature,,as we de-link ourselves spiritually,from these animals,,we lose hope,,we lose that spiritual connection,,our dignity, that thing within us,that keeps us connected to the planet. 
 BJ: So you have to know, looking into the eyes,of lions and leopards right now,,it is all about critical awareness.,And so what we are doing,,in February, we're bringing out a film called "The Last Lion,",and "The Last Lion" is exactly,what is happening right now.,That is the situation we're in --,the last lions.,That is, if we don't take action and do something,,these plains will be completely devoid,of big cats,,and then, in turn, everything else will disappear.,And simply, if we can't protect them,,we're going to have a job protecting ourselves as well. 
 DJ: And in fact, that original thing that we spoke about,and designed our lives by --,that conservation was all about respect,and celebration --,is probably true. That's really what it needs.,We need it. We respect and celebrate each other,as a man and a woman, as a community,and as part of this planet,,and we need to continue that. 
 And Legadema?,Well we can report, in fact,,that we're grandparents. 
 (Laughter) 
 BJ/DJ: Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Ever since I was a little girl,seeing "Star Wars" for the first time,,I've been fascinated by this idea,of personal robots.,And as a little girl,,I loved the idea of a robot that interacted with us,much more like a helpful, trusted sidekick --,something that would delight us, enrich our lives,and help us save a galaxy or two.,I knew robots like that didn't really exist,,but I knew I wanted to build them. 
 So 20 years pass --,I am now a graduate student at MIT,studying artificial intelligence,,the year is 1997,,and NASA has just landed the first robot on Mars.,But robots are still not in our home, ironically.,And I remember thinking about,all the reasons why that was the case.,But one really struck me.,Robotics had really been about interacting with things,,not with people --,certainly not in a social way that would be natural for us,and would really help people accept robots,into our daily lives.,For me, that was the white space; that's what robots could not do yet.,And so that year, I started to build this robot, Kismet,,the world's first social robot.,Three years later --,a lot of programming,,working with other graduate students in the lab --,Kismet was ready to start interacting with people. 
 (Video) Scientist: I want to show you something. 
 Kismet: (Nonsense) 
 Scientist: This is a watch that my girlfriend gave me. 
 Kismet: (Nonsense) 
 Scientist: Yeah, look, it's got a little blue light in it too.,I almost lost it this week. 
 Cynthia Breazeal: So Kismet interacted with people,like kind of a non-verbal child or pre-verbal child,,which I assume was fitting because it was really the first of its kind.,It didn't speak language, but it didn't matter.,This little robot was somehow able,to tap into something deeply social within us --,and with that, the promise of an entirely new way,we could interact with robots. 
 So over the past several years,I've been continuing to explore this interpersonal dimension of robots,,now at the media lab,with my own team of incredibly talented students.,And one of my favorite robots is Leonardo.,We developed Leonardo in collaboration with Stan Winston Studio.,And so I want to show you a special moment for me of Leo.,This is Matt Berlin interacting with Leo,,introducing Leo to a new object.,And because it's new, Leo doesn't really know what to make of it.,But sort of like us, he can actually learn about it,from watching Matt's reaction. 
 (Video) Matt Berlin: Hello, Leo.,Leo, this is Cookie Monster.,Can you find Cookie Monster?,Leo, Cookie Monster is very bad.,He's very bad, Leo.,Cookie Monster is very, very bad.,He's a scary monster.,He wants to get your cookies. 
 (Laughter) 
 CB: All right, so Leo and Cookie,might have gotten off to a little bit of a rough start,,but they get along great now. 
 So what I've learned,through building these systems,is that robots are actually,a really intriguing social technology,,where it's actually their ability,to push our social buttons,and to interact with us like a partner,that is a core part of their functionality.,And with that shift in thinking, we can now start to imagine,new questions, new possibilities for robots,that we might not have thought about otherwise.,But what do I mean when I say "push our social buttons?",Well, one of the things that we've learned,is that, if we design these robots to communicate with us,using the same body language,,the same sort of non-verbal cues that people use --,like Nexi, our humanoid robot, is doing here --,what we find is that people respond to robots,a lot like they respond to people.,People use these cues to determine things like how persuasive someone is,,how likable, how engaging,,how trustworthy.,It turns out it's the same for robots. 
 It's turning out now,that robots are actually becoming a really interesting new scientific tool,to understand human behavior.,To answer questions like, how is it that, from a brief encounter,,we're able to make an estimate of how trustworthy another person is?,Mimicry's believed to play a role, but how?,Is it the mimicking of particular gestures that matters?,It turns out it's really hard,to learn this or understand this from watching people,because when we interact we do all of these cues automatically.,We can't carefully control them because they're subconscious for us.,But with the robot, you can. 
 And so in this video here --,this is a video taken from David DeSteno's lab at Northeastern University.,He's a psychologist we've been collaborating with.,There's actually a scientist carefully controlling Nexi's cues,to be able to study this question.,And the bottom line is -- the reason why this works is,because it turns out people just behave like people,even when interacting with a robot.,So given that key insight,,we can now start to imagine,new kinds of applications for robots.,For instance, if robots do respond to our non-verbal cues,,maybe they would be a cool, new communication technology.,So imagine this:,What about a robot accessory for your cellphone?,You call your friend, she puts her handset in a robot,,and, bam! You're a MeBot --,you can make eye contact, you can talk with your friends,,you can move around, you can gesture --,maybe the next best thing to really being there, or is it? 
 To explore this question,,my student, Siggy Adalgeirsson, did a study,where we brought human participants, people, into our lab,to do a collaborative task,with a remote collaborator.,The task involved things,like looking at a set of objects on the table,,discussing them in terms of their importance and relevance to performing a certain task --,this ended up being a survival task --,and then rating them in terms,of how valuable and important they thought they were.,The remote collaborator was an experimenter from our group,who used one of three different technologies,to interact with the participants.,The first was just the screen.,This is just like video conferencing today.,The next was to add mobility -- so, have the screen on a mobile base.,This is like, if you're familiar with any of the telepresence robots today --,this is mirroring that situation.,And then the fully expressive MeBot. 
 So after the interaction,,we asked people to rate their quality of interaction,with the technology, with a remote collaborator,through this technology, in a number of different ways.,We looked at psychological involvement --,how much empathy did you feel for the other person?,We looked at overall engagement.,We looked at their desire to cooperate.,And this is what we see when they use just the screen.,It turns out, when you add mobility -- the ability to roll around the table --,you get a little more of a boost.,And you get even more of a boost when you add the full expression.,So it seems like this physical, social embodiment,actually really makes a difference. 
 Now let's try to put this into a little bit of context.,Today we know that families are living further and further apart,,and that definitely takes a toll on family relationships,and family bonds over distance.,For me, I have three young boys,,and I want them to have a really good relationship,with their grandparents.,But my parents live thousands of miles away,,so they just don't get to see each other that often.,We try Skype, we try phone calls,,but my boys are little -- they don't really want to talk;,they want to play.,So I love the idea of thinking about robots,as a new kind of distance-play technology.,I imagine a time not too far from now --,my mom can go to her computer,,open up a browser and jack into a little robot.,And as grandma-bot,,she can now play, really play,,with my sons, with her grandsons,,in the real world with his real toys.,I could imagine grandmothers being able to do social-plays,with their granddaughters, with their friends,,and to be able to share all kinds of other activities around the house,,like sharing a bedtime story.,And through this technology,,being able to be an active participant,in their grandchildren's lives,in a way that's not possible today. 
 Let's think about some other domains,,like maybe health.,So in the United States today,,over 65 percent of people are either overweight or obese,,and now it's a big problem with our children as well.,And we know that as you get older in life,,if you're obese when you're younger, that can lead to chronic diseases,that not only reduce your quality of life,,but are a tremendous economic burden on our health care system.,But if robots can be engaging,,if we like to cooperate with robots,,if robots are persuasive,,maybe a robot can help you,maintain a diet and exercise program,,maybe they can help you manage your weight.,Sort of like a digital Jiminy --,as in the well-known fairy tale --,a kind of friendly, supportive presence that's always there,to be able to help you make the right decision,in the right way at the right time,to help you form healthy habits.,So we actually explored this idea in our lab. 
 This is a robot, Autom.,Cory Kidd developed this robot for his doctoral work.,And it was designed to be a robot diet-and-exercise coach.,It had a couple of simple non-verbal skills it could do.,It could make eye contact with you.,It could share information looking down at a screen.,You'd use a screen interface to enter information,,like how many calories you ate that day,,how much exercise you got.,And then it could help track that for you.,And the robot spoke with a synthetic voice,to engage you in a coaching dialogue,modeled after trainers,and patients and so forth.,And it would build a working alliance with you,through that dialogue.,It could help you set goals and track your progress,,and it would help motivate you. 
 So an interesting question is,,does the social embodiment really matter? Does it matter that it's a robot?,Is it really just the quality of advice and information that matters?,To explore that question,,we did a study in the Boston area,where we put one of three interventions in people's homes,for a period of several weeks.,One case was the robot you saw there, Autom.,Another was a computer that ran the same touch-screen interface,,ran exactly the same dialogues.,The quality of advice was identical.,And the third was just a pen and paper log,,because that's the standard intervention you typically get,when you start a diet-and-exercise program. 
 So one of the things we really wanted to look at,was not how much weight people lost,,but really how long they interacted with the robot.,Because the challenge is not losing weight, it's actually keeping it off.,And the longer you could interact with one of these interventions,,well that's indicative, potentially, of longer-term success.,So the first thing I want to look at is how long,,how long did people interact with these systems.,It turns out that people interacted with the robot,significantly more,,even though the quality of the advice was identical to the computer.,When it asked people to rate it on terms of the quality of the working alliance,,people rated the robot higher,and they trusted the robot more.,(Laughter),And when you look at emotional engagement,,it was completely different.,People would name the robots.,They would dress the robots.,(Laughter),And even when we would come up to pick up the robots at the end of the study,,they would come out to the car and say good-bye to the robots.,They didn't do this with a computer. 
 The last thing I want to talk about today,is the future of children's media.,We know that kids spend a lot of time behind screens today,,whether it's television or computer games or whatnot.,My sons, they love the screen. They love the screen.,But I want them to play; as a mom, I want them to play,,like, real-world play.,And so I have a new project in my group I wanted to present to you today,called Playtime Computing,that's really trying to think about how we can take,what's so engaging about digital media,and literally bring it off the screen,into the real world of the child,,where it can take on many of the properties of real-world play.,So here's the first exploration of this idea,,where characters can be physical or virtual,,and where the digital content,can literally come off the screen,into the world and back.,I like to think of this,as the Atari Pong,of this blended-reality play. 
 But we can push this idea further.,What if --,(Game) Nathan: Here it comes. Yay!,CB: -- the character itself could come into your world?,It turns out that kids love it,when the character becomes real and enters into their world.,And when it's in their world,,they can relate to it and play with it in a way,that's fundamentally different from how they play with it on the screen.,Another important idea is this notion,of persistence of character across realities.,So changes that children make in the real world,need to translate to the virtual world.,So here, Nathan has changed the letter A to the number 2.,You can imagine maybe these symbols,give the characters special powers when it goes into the virtual world.,So they are now sending the character back into that world.,And now it's got number power. 
 And then finally, what I've been trying to do here,is create a really immersive experience for kids,,where they really feel like they are part of that story,,a part of that experience.,And I really want to spark their imaginations,the way mine was sparked as a little girl watching "Star Wars.",But I want to do more than that.,I actually want them to create those experiences.,I want them to be able to literally build their imagination,into these experiences and make them their own.,So we've been exploring a lot of ideas,in telepresence and mixed reality,to literally allow kids to project their ideas into this space,where other kids can interact with them,and build upon them.,I really want to come up with new ways of children's media,that foster creativity and learning and innovation.,I think that's very, very important. 
 So this is a new project.,We've invited a lot of kids into this space,,and they think it's pretty cool.,But I can tell you, the thing that they love the most,is the robot.,What they care about is the robot.,Robots touch something deeply human within us.,And so whether they're helping us,to become creative and innovative,,or whether they're helping us,to feel more deeply connected despite distance,,or whether they are our trusted sidekick,who's helping us attain our personal goals,in becoming our highest and best selves,,for me, robots are all about people. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)There are two groups of women,when it comes to screening mammography --,women in whom mammography works very well,and has saved thousands of lives,and women in whom it doesn't work well at all.,Do you know which group you're in?,If you don't, you're not alone.,Because the breast has become,a very political organ.,The truth has become lost,in all the rhetoric,coming from the press, politicians,,radiologists,and medical imaging companies.,I will do my best this morning,to tell you what I think is the truth.,But first, my disclosures.,I am not a breast cancer survivor.,I'm not a radiologist.,I don't have any patents,,and I've never received any money from a medical imaging company,,and I am not seeking your vote. 
 (Laughter) 
 What I am,is a doctor of internal medicine,who became passionately interested in this topic,about 10 years ago,when a patient asked me a question.,She came to see me,after discovering a breast lump.,Her sister had been diagnosed with breast cancer,in her 40s.,She and I were both very pregnant at that time,,and my heart just ached for her,,imagining how afraid she must be.,Fortunately, her lump proved to be benign.,But she asked me a question:,how confident was I,that I would find a tumor early on her mammogram,if she developed one?,So I studied her mammogram,,and I reviewed the radiology literature,,and I was shocked to discover,that, in her case,,our chances of finding a tumor early on the mammogram,were less than the toss of a coin. 
 You may recall a year ago,when a firestorm erupted,after the United States Preventive Services Task Force,reviewed the world's mammography screening literature,and issued a guideline,recommending against screening mammograms,in women in their 40s.,Now everybody rushed to criticize the Task Force,,even though most of them weren't in anyway familiar,with the mammography studies.,It took the Senate just 17 days,to ban the use of the guidelines,in determining insurance coverage.,Radiologists were outraged,by the guidelines.,The pre-eminent mammographer in the United States,issued the following quote,to the Washington Post.,The radiologists were, in turn, criticized,for protecting their own financial self-interest.,But in my view,,the radiologists are heroes.,There's a shortage of radiologists,qualified to read mammograms,,and that's because mammograms are one of the most complex,of all radiology studies to interpret,,and because radiologists,are sued more often,over missed breast cancer,than any other cause.,But that very fact is telling. 
 Where there is this much legal smoke,,there is likely to be some fire.,The factor most responsible for that fire,is breast density.,Breast density refers to the relative amount of fat --,pictured here in yellow --,versus connective and epithelial tissues --,pictured in pink.,And that proportion,is primarily genetically determined.,Two-thirds of women in their 40s,have dense breast tissue,,which is why mammography doesn't work as well in them.,And although breast density generally declines with age,,up to a third of women,retain dense breast tissue,for years after menopause. 
 So how do you know if your breasts are dense?,Well, you need to read the details,of your mammography report.,Radiologists classify breast density,into four categories,based on the appearance of the tissue on a mammogram.,If the breast is less than 25 percent dense,,that's called fatty-replaced.,The next category,is scattered fibroglandular densities,,followed by heterogeneously dense,and extremely dense.,And breasts that fall into these two categories,are considered dense.,The problem with breast density,is that it's truly the wolf in sheep's clothing.,Both tumors and dense breast tissue,appear white on a mammogram,,and the X-ray often can't distinguish between the two.,So it's easy to see this tumor,in the upper part of this fatty breast.,But imagine how difficult it would be,to find that tumor in this dense breast.,That's why mammograms find,over 80 percent of tumors in fatty breasts,,but as few as 40 percent in extremely dense breasts. 
 Now it's bad enough that breast density,makes it hard to find a cancer,,but it turns out,that it's also a powerful predictor,of your risk for breast cancer.,It's a stronger risk factor,than having a mother or a sister with breast cancer.,At the time my patient posed this question to me,,breast density was an obscure topic,in the radiology literature,,and very few women having mammograms,,or the physicians ordering them,,knew about this.,But what else could I offer her? 
 Mammograms have been around since the 1960's,,and it's changed very little.,There have been surprisingly few innovations,,until digital mammography was approved,in 2000.,Digital mammography is still an X-ray of the breast,,but the images,can be stored and manipulated digitally,,just like we can with a digital camera.,The U.S. has invested,four billion dollars,converting to digital mammography equipment,,and what have we gained from that investment?,In a study funded by over 25 million taxpayer dollars,,digital mammography was found,to be no better over all,than traditional mammography,,and in fact, it was worse in older women.,But it was better in one group,,and that was women under 50,who were pre-menopausal and had dense breasts,,and in those women,,digital mammography found twice as many cancers,,but it still only found 60 percent.,So digital mammography,has been a giant leap forward,for manufacturers,of digital mammography equipment,,but it's been a very small step forward for,womankind. 
 What about ultrasound?,Ultrasound generates more biopsies,that are unnecessary relative to other technologies,,so it's not widely used.,And MRI is exquisitely sensitive for finding tumors,,but it's also very expensive.,If we think about disruptive technology,,we see an almost ubiquitous pattern,of the technology getting smaller and less expensive.,Think about iPods compared to stereos.,But it's the exact opposite in health care.,The machines get ever bigger,and ever more expensive.,Screening the average young woman with an MRI,is kind of like driving to the grocery store in a Hummer.,It's just way too much equipment.,One MRI scan,costs 10 times what a digital mammogram costs.,And sooner or later, we're going to have to accept the fact,that health care innovation,can't always come at a much higher price. 
 Malcolm Gladwell wrote an article in the New Yorker,on innovation,,and he made the case that scientific discoveries,are rarely the product of one individual's genius.,Rather, big ideas can be orchestrated,,if you can simply gather,people with different perspectives in a room,and get them to talk about things,that they don't ordinarily talk about.,It's like the essence of TED.,He quotes one innovator who says,,"The only time a physician and a physicist get together,is when the physicist gets sick.",(Laughter),This makes no sense,,because physicians have all kinds of problems,that they don't realize have solutions.,And physicists have all kinds of solutions for things,that they don't realize are problems.,Now, take a look at this cartoon,that accompanied Gladwell's article,,and tell me if you see something disturbing,about this depiction of innovative thinkers. 
 (Laughter) 
 So if you will allow me a little creative license,,I will tell you the story,of the serendipitous collision,of my patient's problem,with a physicist's solution.,Shortly after her visit,,I was introduced to a nuclear physicist,at Mayo,named Michael O'Conner,,who was a specialist in cardiac imaging,,something I had nothing to do with.,And he happened to tell me,about a conference he'd just returned from in Israel,,where they were talking about a new type of gamma detector.,Now gamma imaging has been around for a long time,to image the heart,,and it had even been tried to image the breast.,But the problem was,that the gamma detectors,were these huge, bulky tubes,,and they were filled with these scintillating crystals,,and you just couldn't get them close enough around the breast,to find small tumors.,But the potential advantage was,that gamma rays, unlike X-rays,,are not influenced by breast density.,But this technology,could not find tumors when they're small,,and finding a small tumor is critical for survival.,If you can find a tumor,when it's less than a centimeter,,survival exceeds 90 percent,,but drops off rapidly,as tumor size increases.,But Michael told me about,a new type of gamma detector that he'd seen,,and this is it.,It's made,not of a bulky tube,,but of a thin layer of a semiconductor material,that serves as the gamma detector.,And I started talking to him,about this problem with breast density,,and we realized that we might be able to get this detector,close enough around the breast,to actually find small tumors. 
 So after putting together,a grid of these cubes with tape --,(Laughter),-- Michael hacked off the X-ray plate,of a mammography machine,that was about to be thrown out,,and we attached the new detector,,and we decided to call this machine,Molecular Breast Imaging, or MBI.,This is an image from our first patient.,And you can see, using the old gamma technology,,that it just looked like noise.,But using our new detector,,we could begin to see the outline of a tumor. 
 So here we were, a nuclear physicist,,an internist,,soon joined by Carrie Hruska, a biomedical engineer,,and two radiologists,,and we were trying to take on,the entrenched world of mammography,with a machine that was held together by duct tape.,To say that we faced,high doses of skepticism,in those early years,is just a huge understatement,,but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work,that we chipped away with incremental modifications,to this system.,This is our current detector.,And you can see that it looks a lot different.,The duct tape is gone,,and we added a second detector on top of the breast,,which has further improved our tumor detection. 
 So how does this work?,The patient receives an injection of a radio tracer,that's taken up by rapidly proliferating tumor cells,,but not by normal cells,,and this is the key difference from mammography.,Mammography relies on differences,in the appearance of the tumor from the background tissue,,and we've seen that those differences,can be obscured in a dense breast.,But MBI exploits,the different molecular behavior of tumors,,and therefore, it's impervious to breast density.,After the injection,,the patient's breast is placed between the detectors.,And if you've ever had a mammogram --,if you're old enough to have had a mammogram --,you know what comes next:,pain.,You may be surprised to know,that mammography is the only radiologic study,that's regulated by federal law,,and the law requires,that the equivalent of a 40-pound car battery,come down on your breast during this study.,But with MBI,,we use just light, pain-free compression.,(Applause),And the detector,then transmits the image to the computer. 
 So here's an example.,You can see, on the right, a mammogram,showing a faint tumor,,the edges of which are blurred by the dense tissue.,But the MBI image shows that tumor much more clearly,,as well as a second tumor,,which profoundly influence that patient's surgical options.,In this example, although the mammogram found one tumor,,we were able to demonstrate three discrete tumors --,one is small as three millimeters. 
 Our big break came in 2004.,After we had demonstrated that we could find small tumors,,we used these images,to submit a grant to the Susan G. Komen Foundation.,And we were elated when they took a chance,on a team of completely unknown investigators,and funded us to study,1,000 women with dense breasts,,comparing a screening mammogram to an MBI.,Of the tumors that we found,,mammography found,only 25 percent of those tumors.,MBI found 83 percent.,Here's an example from that screening study.,The digital mammogram was read as normal,and shows lots of dense tissue,,but the MBI shows an area of intense uptake,,which correlated with a two-centimeter tumor.,In this case, a one-centimeter tumor.,And in this case,,a 45-year-old medical secretary at Mayo,,who had lost her mother to breast cancer when she was very young,,wanted to enroll in our study.,And her mammogram showed an area of very dense tissue,,but her MBI showed an area,of worrisome uptake,,which we can also see on a color image.,And this corresponded,to a tumor the size of a golf ball.,But fortunately it was removed,before it had spread to her lymph nodes. 
 So now that we knew that this technology,could find three times more tumors in a dense breast,,we had to solve one very important problem.,We had to figure out how to lower the radiation dose,,and we have spent the last three years,making modifications to every aspect of the imaging system,to allow this.,And I'm very happy to report that we're now using a dose of radiation,that is equivalent to the effective dose,from one digital mammogram.,And at this low dose, we're continuing this screening study,,and this image from three weeks ago,in a 67-year-old woman,shows a normal digital mammogram,,but an MBI image,showing an uptake that proved to be a large cancer.,So this is not just young women that it's benefiting.,It's also older women with dense tissue.,And we're now routinely using one-fifth the radiation dose,that's used in any other type of gamma technology. 
 MBI generates four images per breast.,MRI generates over a thousand.,It takes a radiologist,years of specialty training,to become expert in differentiating,the normal anatomic detail,from the worrisome finding.,But I suspect even the non-radiologists in the room,can find the tumor on the MBI image.,But this is why MBI,is so potentially disruptive --,it's as accurate as MRI,,it's far less complex to interpret,,and it's a fraction of the cost.,But you can understand why there may be,forces in the breast-imaging world,who prefer the status quo. 
 After achieving what we felt were remarkable results,,our manuscript was rejected,by four journals.,After the fourth rejection,,we requested reconsideration of the manuscript,,because we strongly suspected,that one of the reviewers who had rejected it,had a financial conflict of interest,in a competing technology.,Our manuscript was then accepted,and will be published later this month,in the journal Radiology.,(Applause),We still need to complete the screening study using the low dose,,and then our findings will need to be replicated,at other institutions,,and this could take five or more years.,If this technology is widely adopted,,I will not benefit financially in any way,,and that is very important to me,,because it allows me to continue to tell you the truth.,But I recognize --,(Applause),I recognize that the adoption of this technology,will depend as much on economic,and political forces,as it will on the soundness of the science. 
 The MBI unit has now been FDA approved,,but it's not yet widely available.,So until something is available,for women with dense breasts,,there are things that you should know,to protect yourself.,First, know your density.,Ninety percent of women don't,,and 95 percent of women don't know,that it increases your breast cancer risk.,The State of Connecticut became the first and only state,to mandate that women receive notification,of their breast density,after a mammogram.,I was at a conference of 60,000 people in breast-imaging,last week in Chicago,,and I was stunned that there was a heated debate,as to whether we should be telling women,what their breast density is.,Of course we should.,And if you don't know, please ask your doctor,or read the details of your mammography report.,Second, if you're pre-menopausal,,try to schedule your mammogram,in the first two weeks of your menstrual cycle,,when breast density is relatively lower.,Third, if you notice a persistent change in your breast,,insist on additional imaging.,And fourth and most important,,the mammography debate will rage on,,but I do believe that all women 40 and older,should have an annual mammogram. 
 Mammography isn't perfect,,but it's the only test that's been proven,to reduce mortality from breast cancer.,But this mortality banner,is the very sword,which mammography's most ardent advocates use,to deter innovation.,Some women who develop breast cancer,die from it many years later,,and most women, thankfully, survive.,So it takes 10 or more years,for any screening method,to demonstrate a reduction,in mortality from breast cancer.,Mammography's the only one that's been around long enough,to have a chance of making that claim.,It is time for us to accept,both the extraordinary successes of mammography,and the limitations.,We need to individualize screening,based on density.,For women without dense breasts,,mammography is the best choice.,But for women with dense breasts;,we shouldn't abandon screening altogether,,we need to offer them something better. 
 The babies that we were carrying,when my patient first asked me this question,are now both in middle school,,and the answer has been so slow to come.,She's given me her blessing,to share this story with you.,After undergoing biopsies,that further increased her risk for cancer,and losing her sister to cancer,,she made the difficult decision,to have a prophylactic mastectomy.,We can and must do better,,not just in time for her granddaughters,and my daughters,,but in time for you. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)This room may appear,to be holding 600 people,,but there's actually so many more,,because in each one of us,there is a multitude of personalities.,I have two primary personalities,that have been in conflict and conversation within me,since I was a little girl.,I call them "the mystic",and "the warrior.",I was born into a family,of politically active,,intellectual atheists.,There was this equation in my family that went something like this:,if you are intelligent,,you therefore are not spiritual.,I was the freak of the family.,I was this weird little kid,who wanted to have deep talks,about the worlds that might exist,beyond the ones that we perceive with our senses.,I wanted to know,if what we human beings see,and hear and think,is a full and accurate picture,of reality.,So, looking for answers,,I went to Catholic mass.,I tagged along with my neighbors.,I read Sartre and Socrates.,And then a wonderful thing happened,when I was in high school:,Gurus from the East,started washing up on the shores of America.,And I said to myself,,"I wanna get me one of them." 
 And ever since,,I've been walking the mystic path,,trying to peer beyond,what Albert Einstein called,"the optical delusion,of everyday consciousness.",So what did he mean by this? I'll show you.,Take a breath right now,of this clear air in this room.,Now, see this strange,,underwater,,coral reef-looking thing?,It's actually a person's trachea,,and those colored globs,are microbes,that are actually swimming around in this room,right now, all around us.,If we're blind to this simple biology,,imagine what we're missing,at the smallest subatomic level right now,and at the grandest cosmic levels.,My years as a mystic,have made me question,almost all my assumptions.,They've made me a proud I-don't-know-it-all. 
 Now when the mystic part of me,jabbers on and on like this,,the warrior rolls her eyes.,She's concerned,about what's happening in this world right now.,She's worried.,She says, "Excuse me, I'm pissed off,,and I know a few things,,and we better get busy about them right now.",I've spent my life as a warrior,,working for women's issues,,working on political campaigns,,being an activist for the environment.,And it can be sort of crazy-making,,housing both the mystic and the warrior,in one body.,I've always been attracted,to those rare people,who pull that off,,who devote their lives to humanity,with the grit of the warrior,and the grace of the mystic --,people like Martin Luther King, Jr.,,who wrote, "I can never be,what I ought to be,until you are,what you ought to be.,This," he wrote, "is the interrelated structure,of reality.",Then Mother Teresa, another mystic warrior,,who said, "The problem with the world,is that we draw the circle of our family,too small.",And Nelson Mandela,,who lives by the African concept,of "ubuntu,",which means "I need you,in order to be me,,and you need me in order to be you.",Now we all love to trot out,these three mystic warriors,as if they were born,with the saint gene.,But we all actually have,the same capacity that they do,,and we need to do,their work now. 
 I'm deeply disturbed,by the ways in which all of our cultures,are demonizing "the Other",by the voice we're giving,to the most divisive among us.,Listen to these titles,of some of the bestselling books,from both sides of the political divide,here in the U.S.,"Liberalism Is a Mental Disorder,","Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot,","Pinheads and Patriots,","Arguing With Idiots.",They're supposedly tongue-in-cheek,,but they're actually dangerous.,Now here's a title that may sound familiar,,but whose author may surprise you:,"Four-and-a-Half-Years of Struggle,Against Lies, Stupidity,and Cowardice.",Who wrote that?,That was Adolf Hitler's first title,for "Mein Kampf" -- "My Struggle" --,the book that launched the Nazi party.,The worst eras in human history,,whether in Cambodia or Germany,or Rwanda,,they start like this, with negative other-izing.,And then they morph,into violent extremism. 
 This is why I'm launching a new initiative.,And it's to help all of us,,myself included,,to counteract the tendency,to "otherize.",And I realize we're all busy people,,so don't worry, you can do this on a lunch break.,I'm calling my initiative,,"Take the Other to Lunch.",If you are,a Republican,,you can take a Democrat to lunch,,or if you're a Democrat,,think of it,as taking a Republican to lunch.,Now if the idea of taking any of these people to lunch,makes you lose your appetite,,I suggest you start more local,,because there is no shortage of the Other,right in your own neighborhood.,Maybe that person,who worships at the mosque,,or the church or the synagogue, down the street.,Or someone from the other side,of the abortion conflict.,Or maybe your brother-in-law,who doesn't believe in global warming.,Anyone whose lifestyle may frighten you,,or whose point of view,makes smoke come out of your ears. 
 A couple of weeks ago,,I took a Conservative Tea Party woman to lunch.,Now on paper, she passed my smoking ears test.,She's an activist from the Right,,and I'm an activist from the Left.,And we used some guidelines,to keep our conversation elevated,,and you can use them too,,because I know you're all going,to take an Other to lunch.,So first of all, decide on a goal:,to get to know one person,from a group you may have negatively stereotyped.,And then, before you get together,,agree on some ground rules.,My Tea Party lunchmate and I,came up with these:,don't persuade, defend,or interrupt.,Be curious;,be conversational; be real.,And listen. 
 From there, we dove in.,And we used these questions:,Share some of your life experiences with me.,What issues,deeply concern you?,And what have you always wanted to ask,someone from the other side?,My lunch partner and I,came away with some really important insights,,and I'm going to share just one with you.,I think it has relevance,to any problem,between people anywhere.,I asked her why her side,makes such outrageous allegations,and lies about my side.,"What?" she wanted to know.,"Like we're a bunch,of elitist,,morally-corrupt terrorist-lovers.",Well, she was shocked.,She thought my side,beat up on her side way more often,,that we called them brainless,,gun-toting racists,,and we both marveled,at the labels that fit,none of the people,we actually know.,And since we had established some trust,,we believed in each other's sincerity. 
 We agreed we'd speak up in our own communities,when we witnessed,the kind of "otherizing" talk,that can wound,and fester into paranoia,and then be used by those on the fringes,to incite.,By the end of our lunch,,we acknowledged each other's openness.,Neither of us had tried to change the other.,But we also hadn't pretended,that our differences were just going to melt away,after a lunch.,Instead, we had taken,first steps together,,past our knee-jerk reactions,,to the ubuntu place,,which is the only place,where solutions,to our most intractable-seeming problems,will be found. 
 Who should you invite to lunch?,Next time you catch yourself,in the act of otherizing,,that will be your clue.,And what might happen at your lunch?,Will the heavens open,and "We Are the World" play over the restaurant sound system?,Probably not.,Because ubuntu work is slow,,and it's difficult.,It's two people,dropping the pretense,of being know-it-alls.,It's two people,,two warriors,,dropping their weapons,and reaching toward each other.,Here's how the great Persian poet Rumi put it:,"Out beyond ideas,of wrong-doing and right-doing,,there is a field.,I'll meet you there." 
 (Applause)As a child,,I was raised by native Hawaiian elders --,three old women,who took care of me while my parents worked.,The year is 1963.,We're at the ocean.,It's twilight.,We're watching the rising of the stars,and the shifting of the tides.,It's a stretch of beach we know so well.,The smooth stones on the sand,are familiar to us.,If you saw these women on the street,in their faded clothes,,you might dismiss them,as poor and simple.,That would be a mistake.,These women are descendants,of Polynesian navigators,,trained in the old ways,by their elders,,and now they're passing it on to me.,They teach me the names of the winds and the rains,,of astronomy according to a genealogy of stars.,There's a new moon on the horizon.,Hawaiians say it's a good night for fishing.,They begin to chant. 
 [Hawaiian chant] 
 When they finish,,they sit in a circle,and ask me to come to join them.,They want to teach me about my destiny.,I thought every seven-year-old went through this.,(Laughter),"Baby girl,,someday the world will be in trouble.,People will forget their wisdom.,It will take elders' voices,from the far corners of the world,to call the world into balance.,You will go far away.,It will sometimes be a lonely road.,We will not be there.,But you will look into the eyes,of seeming strangers,,and you will recognize your ohana,,your family.,And it will take all of you.,It will take all of you.",These words, I hold onto,all my life.,Because the idea of doing it alone,terrifies me. 
 The year is 2007.,I'm on a remote island in Micronesia.,Satawal is one half-mile long,by one mile wide.,It's the home of my mentor.,His name is Pius Mau Piailug.,Mau is a palu,,a navigator priest.,He's also considered,the greatest wave finder in the world.,There are fewer than a handful,of palu left on this island.,Their tradition is so extraordinary,that these mariners sailed,three million square miles across the Pacific,without the use of instruments.,They could synthesize patterns in nature,using the rising and setting of stars,,the sequence and direction of waves,,the flight patterns of certain birds.,Even the slightest hint of color,on the underbelly of a cloud,would inform them,and help them navigate with the keenest accuracy. 
 When Western scientists would join Mau on the canoe,and watch him go into the hull,,it appeared that an old man,was going to rest.,In fact, the hull of the canoe,is the womb of the vessel.,It is the most accurate place,to feel the rhythm and sequence,and direction of waves.,Mau was, in fact,,gathering explicit data,using his entire body.,It's what he had been trained to do,since he was five years old.,Now science may dismiss this methodology,,but Polynesian navigators use it today,because it provides them,an accurate determination,of the angle and direction,of their vessel. 
 The palu also had,an uncanny ability,to forecast weather conditions,days in advance.,Sometimes I'd be with Mau on a cloud-covered night,and we'd sit at the easternmost coast of the island,,and he would look out,,and then he would say,,"Okay, we go.",He saw that first glint of light --,he knew what the weather was going to be three days from now. 
 Their achievements, intellectually and scientifically,,are extraordinary,,and they are so relevant,for these times that we are in,when we are riding out storms.,We are in such a critical moment,of our collective history.,They have been compared,to astronauts --,these elder navigators,who sail vast open oceans,in double-hulled canoes,thousands of miles,from a small island.,Their canoes, our rockets;,their sea, our space.,The wisdom of these elders,is not a mere collection,of stories about old people,in some remote spot.,This is part of our collective narrative.,It's humanity's DNA.,We cannot afford to lose it. 
 The year is 2010.,Just as the women in Hawaii,that raised me predicted,,the world is in trouble.,We live in a society,bloated with data,,yet starved for wisdom.,We're connected 24/7,,yet anxiety,,fear, depression and loneliness,is at an all-time high.,We must course-correct.,An African shaman said,,"Your society worships the jester,while the king stands,in plain clothes.",The link between the past and the future,is fragile.,This I know intimately,,because even as I travel,throughout the world,to listen to these stories and record them,,I struggle.,I am haunted,by the fact that I no longer remember,the names of the winds and the rains. 
 Mau passed away,five months ago,,but his legacy and lessons live on.,And I am reminded,that throughout the world,there are cultures,with vast sums of knowledge in them,,as potent as the Micronesian navigators,,that are going dismissed,,that this is a testament,to brilliant, brilliant,technology and science and wisdom,that is vanishing rapidly.,Because when an elder dies a library is burned,,and throughout the world, libraries are ablaze. 
 I am grateful for the fact,that I had a mentor like Mau,who taught me how to navigate.,And I realize,through a lesson that he shared,that we continue to find our way.,And this is what he said:,"The island is the canoe;,the canoe, the island.",And what he meant was,,if you are voyaging,and far from home,,your very survival depends,on everyone aboard.,You cannot make the voyage alone,,you were never meant to.,This whole notion of every man for himself,is completely unsustainable.,It always was. 
 So in closing I would offer you this:,The planet is our canoe,,and we are the voyagers.,True navigation,begins in the human heart.,It's the most important map of all.,Together, may we journey well. 
 (Applause)It sure used to be a lot easier to be from Iceland,,because until a couple of years ago,,people knew hardly anything about us,,and I could basically come out here,and say only good things about us.,But in the last couple of years,we've become infamous for a couple of things.,First, of course, the economic meltdown.,It actually got so bad,that somebody put our country up for sale on eBay.,(Laughter),Ninety-nine pence was the starting price,and no reserve.,Then there was the volcano,that interrupted the travel plans,of almost all of you and many of your friends,,including President Obama.,By the way, the pronunciation,is "Eyjafjallajokull.",None of your media got it right. 
 (Laughter) 
 But I'm not here to share these stories,about these two things exactly.,I'm here to tell you the story of Audur Capital,,which is a financial firm founded by me,and Kristin -- who you see in the picture --,in the spring of 2007,,just over a year before the economic collapse hit.,Why would two women,who were enjoying successful careers in investment banking,in the corporate sector,leave to found a financial services firm?,Well let it suffice to say,that we felt a bit overwhelmed,with testosterone.,And I'm not here to say,that men are to blame for the crisis,and what happened in my country.,But I can surely tell you that in my country,,much like on Wall Street and the city of London and elsewhere,,men were at the helm,of the game of the financial sector,,and that kind of lack of diversity,and sameness,leads to disastrous problems. 
 (Applause) 
 So we decided, a bit fed-up with this world,and also with the strong feeling in our stomach,that this wasn't sustainable,,to found a financial services firm,based on our values,,and we decided to incorporate feminine values,into the world of finance.,Raised quite a few eyebrows in Iceland.,We weren't known,as the typical "women" women,in Iceland up until then.,So it was almost like coming out of the closet,to actually talk about the fact that we were women,and that we believed that we had a set of values,and a way of doing business,that would be more sustainable,than what we had experienced until then.,And we got a great group of people to join us --,principled people with great skills,,and investors with a vision,and values to match ours.,And together we got through the eye of the financial storm in Iceland,without taking any direct losses to our equity,or to the funds of our clients.,And although I want to thank,the talented people of our company,foremost for that --,and also there's a factor of luck and timing --,we are absolutely convinced,that we did this because of our values. 
 So let me share with you our values.,We believe in risk awareness.,What does that mean?,We believe that you should always understand the risks that you're taking,,and we will not invest,in things we don't understand.,Not a complicated thing.,But in 2007,,at the height of the sub-prime,and all the complicated financial structures,,it was quite opposite,to the reckless risk-taking behaviors,that we saw on the market.,We also believe in straight-talking,,telling it as it is,,using simple language that people understand,,telling people about the downsides,as well as the potential upsides,,and even telling the bad news that no one wants to utter,,like our lack of belief in the sustainability,of the Icelandic financial sector,that already we had,months before the collapse hit us.,And, although we do work in the financial sector,,where Excel is king,,we believe in emotional capital.,And we believe,that doing emotional due diligence,is just as important,as doing financial due diligence.,It is actually people,that make money and lose money,,not Excel spreadsheets. 
 (Applause) 
 Last, but not least,,we believe in profit with principles.,We care how we make our profit.,So while we want to make economic profit for ourselves and our customers,,we are willing to do it with a long-term view,,and we like to have a wider definition of profits,than just the economic profit in the next quarter.,So we like to see profits,,plus positive social,and environmental benefits, when we invest. 
 But it wasn't just about the values,,although we are convinced that they matter.,It was also about a business opportunity.,It's the female trend, and it's the sustainability trend,,that are going to create,some of the most interesting investment opportunities,in the years to come.,The whole thing about the female trend,is not about women being better than men;,it is actually about,women being different from men,,bringing different values and different ways to the table.,So what do you get? You get better decision-making,,and you get less herd behavior,,and both of those things hit your bottom line,with very positive results. 
 But one has to wonder,,now that we've had this financial sector collapse upon us in Iceland --,and by the way, Europe looks pretty bad right now,,and many would say that you in America,are heading for some more trouble as well.,Now that we've had all that happen,,and we have all this data out there,telling us that it's much better to have diversity,around the decision-making tables,,will we see business and finance change?,Will government change? 
 Well I'll give you my straight talk about this.,I have days that I believe,,but I have days that I'm full of doubt.,Have you seen the incredible urge out there,to rebuild the very things that failed us?,(Applause),Einstein said,that this was the definition of insanity --,to do the same things,over and over again,,hoping for a different outcome.,So I guess the world is insane,,because I see entirely too much,of doing the same things over and over again,,hoping that this time it's not going to collapse upon us.,I want to see more revolutionary thinking,,and I remain hopeful.,Like TED, I believe in people.,And I know that consumers,are becoming more conscious,,and they are going to start voting with their wallets,,and they are going to change the face,of business and finance from the outside,,if they don't do it from the inside. 
 But I'm more of the revolutionary,,and I should be; I'm from Iceland.,We have a long history,of strong, courageous, independent women,,ever since the Viking age.,And I want to tell you when,I first realized that women matter to the economy,and to the society,,I was seven -- it happened to be my mother's birthday --,October 24, 1975.,Women in Iceland took the day off.,From work or from home, they took the day off,,and nothing worked in Iceland.,(Laughter),They marched into the center of Reykjavik,,and they put women's issues onto the agenda.,And some say this was the start of a global movement.,For me it was the start of a long journey,,but I decided that day to matter.,Five years later,,Iceland elected Vigdis Finnbogadottir as their president --,first female to become head of state,,single mom,,a breast cancer survivor,who had had one of her breasts removed.,And at one of the campaign sessions,,she had one of her male contenders,allude to the fact that she couldn't become president --,she was a woman, and even half a woman.,That night she won the election,,because she came back --,not just because of his crappy behavior --,but she came back and said,,"Well, I'm actually not going to breastfeed the Icelandic nation;,I'm going to lead it." 
 (Applause) 
 So I've had incredibly many,women role models,that have influenced who I am and where I am today.,But in spite of that,,I went through the first 10 or 15 years of my career,mostly in denial of being a woman.,Started in corporate America,,and I was absolutely convinced,that it was just about the individual,,that women and men would have just the same opportunities.,But I've come to conclude lately,that it isn't like that.,We are not the same,,and it's great. Because of our differences,,we create and sustain life.,So we should embrace our difference and aim for challenge. 
 The final thought I want to leave with you,is that I'm fed up with this tyranny,of either/or choices in life --,either it's men or it's women.,We need to start embracing the beauty of balance.,So let's move away,from thinking about business here and philanthropy there,,and let's start thinking about,doing good business.,That's how we change the world. That's the only sustainable future. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Some of the greatest innovations,and developments in the world,often happen at the intersection of two fields.,So tonight I'd like to tell you,about the intersection that I'm most excited about at this very moment,,which is entertainment and robotics.,So if we're trying to make robots,that can be more expressive,and that can connect better with us in society,,maybe we should look to some of the human professionals,of artificial emotion and personality,that occur in the dramatic arts.,I'm also interested in creating new technologies for the arts,and to attract people,to science and technology.,Some people in the last decade or two,have started creating artwork with technology.,With my new venture, Marilyn Monrobot,,I would like to use art to create tech. 
 (Laughter) 
 So we're based in New York City.,And if you're a performer that wants to collaborate,with an adorable robot,,or if you have a robot that needs entertainment representation,,please contact me, the Bot-Agent.,The bot, our rising celebrity,,also has his own Twitter account: @robotinthewild.,I'd like to introduce you to one of our first robots, Data.,He's named after the Star Trek character.,I think he's going to be super popular.,We've got the robot --,in his head is a database of a lot of jokes.,Now each of these jokes is labeled with certain attributes.,So it knows something about the subject; it knows about the length.,It knows how much it's moving.,And so it's going to try to watch your response.,I actually have no idea what my robot is going to do today. 
 (Laughter) 
 It can also learn from you,about the quality of its jokes,and cater things, sort of like Netflix-style,,over longer-term,to different communities or audiences,,children versus adults, different cultures.,You can learn something from the robot,about the community that you're in.,And also I can use each one of you as the acting coach,to our future robot companions.,Some of you in this middle section --,you have red/green paddles.,If you like what's going on,,show the green.,If you don't like the subject or the performance,,you can hold the red.,Now don't be shy.,It's just a robot.,It doesn't have feelings ... yet.,(Laughter),And the rest of you,,you still count, you still matter.,There's also a microphone,that's listening to the aggregate laughter and applause,and booing -- I hope not --,to help make some of its next decisions.,Right, so,,let the robot stand-up comedy begin. 
 Data: Hello TEDWomen.,It's an honor to be here. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 You guys are looking good out there.,Ready for some jokes? 
 Audience: Yeah. 
 Data: Here's the first one.,Right, so,,a doctor says to his patient,,"I have bad news and worse news.,The bad news is that you only have 24 hours to live.","That's terrible," said the patient.,"How can the news possibly be worse?","I've been trying to contact you since yesterday." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 The Swiss have an interesting army. Five hundred years without a war.,Heather Knight: He's talking about the Swiss.,Data: Pretty lucky for them.,Ever see that little Swiss Army knife,they have to fight with?,"Come on buddy, I have the toe clippers right here.,You get past me,,the guy behind me has a spoon." 
 (Laughter) 
 HK: He's a French robot. 
 Data: A couple of New Jersey hunters are out in the woods.,One of them falls to the ground.,He does not seem to be breathing.,The other guy whips out his cell phone,and calls 911.,He gasps to the operator, "My friend is dead.,What can I do?",The operator says, "Just take it easy.,I can help.,First, let's make sure he's dead.",There is a silence,,and the operator hears a shot.,The guy's voice comes back on the line,,"Okay, now what?" 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Question: Why is television called a medium?,Anyone?,Because it's neither rare nor well done.,But to be completely honest with you,,I kind of love television.,Any of you like television? Audience: Yes.,Data: I find it incredibly educational.,Actually, as soon as someone turns it on,,I go into the other room and read.,(Laughter),That's all for now.,Was that okay for my first time? 
 (Applause) 
 You've been a great audience.,Thank you. 
 HK: Yay. 
 (Applause) 
 So this is actually the first time,we've ever done live audience feedback to a performance.,So thank you all for being a part of it.,There's a lot more to come.,And we hope to learn a lot about robot expression. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I've been spending a lot of time,traveling around the world these days,,talking to groups of students and professionals,,and everywhere I'm finding that I hear similar themes.,On the one hand, people say,,"The time for change is now.",They want to be part of it.,They talk about wanting lives of purpose and greater meaning.,But on the other hand,,I hear people talking about fear,,a sense of risk-aversion.,They say, "I really want to follow a life of purpose,,but I don't know where to start.,I don't want to disappoint my family or friends.",I work in global poverty.,And they say, "I want to work in global poverty,,but what will it mean about my career?,Will I be marginalized?,Will I not make enough money?,Will I never get married or have children?",And as a woman who didn't get married until I was a lot older --,and I'm glad I waited --,(Laughter),-- and has no children,,I look at these young people,and I say, "Your job is not to be perfect.,Your job is only to be human.,And nothing important happens in life,without a cost.",These conversations really reflect what's happening,at the national and international level.,Our leaders and ourselves,want everything,,but we don't talk about the costs.,We don't talk about the sacrifice. 
 One of my favorite quotes from literature,was written by Tillie Olsen,,the great American writer from the South.,In a short story called "Oh Yes,",she talks about a white woman in the 1950s,who has a daughter,who befriends a little African American girl,,and she looks at her child with a sense of pride,,but she also wonders,,what price will she pay?,"Better immersion,than to live untouched.",But the real question is,,what is the cost of not daring?,What is the cost of not trying? 
 I've been so privileged in my life,to know extraordinary leaders,who have chosen to live lives of immersion.,One woman I knew who was a fellow,at a program that I ran at the Rockefeller Foundation,was named Ingrid Washinawatok.,She was a leader of the Menominee tribe,,a Native American peoples.,And when we would gather as fellows,,she would push us to think about,how the elders in Native American culture,make decisions.,And she said they would literally visualize,the faces of children,for seven generations into the future,,looking at them from the Earth,,and they would look at them, holding them as stewards,for that future.,Ingrid understood that we are connected to each other,,not only as human beings,,but to every living thing on the planet. 
 And tragically, in 1999,,when she was in Colombia,working with the U'wa people,,focused on preserving their culture and language,,she and two colleagues were abducted,and tortured and killed by the FARC.,And whenever we would gather the fellows after that,,we would leave a chair empty for her spirit.,And more than a decade later,,when I talk to NGO fellows,,whether in Trenton, New Jersey or the office of the White House,,and we talk about Ingrid,,they all say that they're trying to integrate her wisdom,and her spirit,and really build on the unfulfilled work,of her life's mission.,And when we think about legacy,,I can think of no more powerful one,,despite how short her life was. 
 And I've been touched by Cambodian women --,beautiful women,,women who held the tradition of the classical dance in Cambodia.,And I met them in the early '90s.,In the 1970s, under the Pol Pot regime,,the Khmer Rouge killed over a million people,,and they focused and targeted the elites and the intellectuals,,the artists, the dancers.,And at the end of the war,,there were only 30 of these classical dancers still living.,And the women, who I was so privileged to meet,when there were three survivors,,told these stories about lying in their cots,in the refugee camps.,They said they would try so hard,to remember the fragments of the dance,,hoping that others were alive and doing the same. 
 And one woman stood there with this perfect carriage,,her hands at her side,,and she talked about,the reunion of the 30 after the war,and how extraordinary it was.,And these big tears fell down her face,,but she never lifted her hands to move them.,And the women decided that they would train,not the next generation of girls, because they had grown too old already,,but the next generation.,And I sat there in the studio,watching these women clapping their hands --,beautiful rhythms --,as these little fairy pixies,were dancing around them,,wearing these beautiful silk colors.,And I thought, after all this atrocity,,this is how human beings really pray.,Because they're focused on honoring,what is most beautiful about our past,and building it into,the promise of our future.,And what these women understood,is sometimes the most important things that we do,and that we spend our time on,are those things that we cannot measure. 
 I also have been touched,by the dark side of power and leadership.,And I have learned that power,,particularly in its absolute form,,is an equal opportunity provider.,In 1986, I moved to Rwanda,,and I worked with a very small group of Rwandan women,to start that country's first microfinance bank.,And one of the women was Agnes --,there on your extreme left --,she was one of the first three,women parliamentarians in Rwanda,,and her legacy should have been,to be one of the mothers of Rwanda.,We built this institution based on social justice,,gender equity,,this idea of empowering women. 
 But Agnes cared more about the trappings of power,than she did principle at the end.,And though she had been part of building a liberal party,,a political party,that was focused on diversity and tolerance,,about three months before the genocide, she switched parties,and joined the extremist party, Hutu Power,,and she became the Minister of Justice,under the genocide regime,and was known for inciting men to kill faster,and stop behaving like women.,She was convicted,of category one crimes of genocide.,And I would visit her in the prisons,,sitting side-by-side, knees touching,,and I would have to admit to myself,that monsters exist in all of us,,but that maybe it's not monsters so much,,but the broken parts of ourselves,,sadnesses, secret shame,,and that ultimately it's easy for demagogues,to prey on those parts,,those fragments, if you will,,and to make us look at other beings, human beings,,as lesser than ourselves --,and in the extreme, to do terrible things. 
 And there is no group,more vulnerable to those kinds of manipulations,than young men.,I've heard it said that the most dangerous animal on the planet,is the adolescent male.,And so in a gathering,where we're focused on women,,while it is so critical that we invest in our girls,and we even the playing field,and we find ways to honor them,,we have to remember that the girls and the women,are most isolated and violated,and victimized and made invisible,in those very societies,where our men and our boys,feel disempowered,,unable to provide.,And that, when they sit on those street corners,and all they can think of in the future,is no job, no education,,no possibility,,well then it's easy to understand,how the greatest source of status,can come from a uniform,and a gun. 
 Sometimes very small investments,can release enormous, infinite potential,that exists in all of us.,One of the Acumen Fund fellows at my organization,,Suraj Sudhakar,,has what we call moral imagination --,the ability to put yourself in another person's shoes,and lead from that perspective.,And he's been working with this young group of men,who come from the largest slum in the world, Kibera.,And they're incredible guys.,And together they started a book club,for a hundred people in the slums,,and they're reading many TED authors and liking it.,And then they created a business plan competition.,Then they decided that they would do TEDx's. 
 And I have learned so much,from Chris and Kevin,and Alex and Herbert,and all of these young men.,Alex, in some ways, said it best.,He said, "We used to feel like nobodies,,but now we feel like somebodies.",And I think we have it all wrong,when we think that income is the link.,What we really yearn for as human beings,is to be visible to each other.,And the reason these young guys,told me that they're doing these TEDx's,is because they were sick and tired,of the only workshops coming to the slums,being those workshops focused on HIV,,or at best, microfinance.,And they wanted to celebrate,what's beautiful about Kibera and Mathare --,the photojournalists and the creatives,,the graffiti artists, the teachers and the entrepreneurs.,And they're doing it.,And my hat's off to you in Kibera. 
 My own work focuses,on making philanthropy more effective,and capitalism more inclusive.,At Acumen Fund, we take philanthropic resources,and we invest what we call patient capital --,money that will invest in entrepreneurs who see the poor,not as passive recipients of charity,,but as full-bodied agents of change,who want to solve their own problems,and make their own decisions.,We leave our money for 10 to 15 years,,and when we get it back, we invest in other innovations,that focus on change.,I know it works.,We've invested more than 50 million dollars in 50 companies,,and those companies have brought another 200 million dollars,into these forgotten markets.,This year alone, they've delivered 40 million services,like maternal health care and housing,,emergency services, solar energy,,so that people can have more dignity,in solving their problems. 
 Patient capital is uncomfortable,for people searching for simple solutions,,easy categories,,because we don't see profit as a blunt instrument.,But we find those entrepreneurs,who put people and the planet,before profit.,And ultimately, we want to be part of a movement,that is about measuring impact,,measuring what is most important to us.,And my dream is we'll have a world one day,where we don't just honor those who take money,and make more money from it,,but we find those individuals who take our resources,and convert it into changing the world,in the most positive ways.,And it's only when we honor them,and celebrate them and give them status,that the world will really change. 
 Last May I had this extraordinary 24-hour period,where I saw two visions of the world,living side-by-side --,one based on violence,and the other on transcendence.,I happened to be in Lahore, Pakistan,on the day that two mosques were attacked,by suicide bombers.,And the reason these mosques were attacked,is because the people praying inside,were from a particular sect of Islam,who fundamentalists don't believe are fully Muslim.,And not only did those suicide bombers,take a hundred lives,,but they did more,,because they created more hatred, more rage, more fear,and certainly despair. 
 But less than 24 hours,,I was 13 miles away from those mosques,,visiting one of our Acumen investees,,an incredible man, Jawad Aslam,,who dares to live a life of immersion.,Born and raised in Baltimore,,he studied real estate, worked in commercial real estate,,and after 9/11 decided he was going to Pakistan to make a difference.,For two years, he hardly made any money, a tiny stipend,,but he apprenticed with this incredible housing developer,named Tasneem Saddiqui.,And he had a dream that he would build a housing community,on this barren piece of land,using patient capital,,but he continued to pay a price.,He stood on moral ground,and refused to pay bribes.,It took almost two years just to register the land.,But I saw how the level of moral standard can rise,from one person's action. 
 Today, 2,000 people live in 300 houses,in this beautiful community.,And there's schools and clinics and shops.,But there's only one mosque.,And so I asked Jawad,,"How do you guys navigate? This is a really diverse community.,Who gets to use the mosque on Fridays?",He said, "Long story.,It was hard, it was a difficult road,,but ultimately the leaders of the community came together,,realizing we only have each other.,And we decided that we would elect,the three most respected imams,,and those imams would take turns,,they would rotate who would say Friday prayer.,But the whole community,,all the different sects, including Shi'a and Sunni,,would sit together and pray." 
 We need that kind of moral leadership and courage,in our worlds.,We face huge issues as a world --,the financial crisis,,global warming,and this growing sense of fear and otherness.,And every day we have a choice.,We can take the easier road,,the more cynical road,,which is a road based on,sometimes dreams of a past that never really was,,a fear of each other,,distancing and blame.,Or we can take the much more difficult path,of transformation, transcendence,,compassion and love,,but also accountability and justice. 
 I had the great honor,of working with the child psychologist Dr. Robert Coles,,who stood up for change,during the Civil Rights movement in the United States.,And he tells this incredible story,about working with a little six-year-old girl named Ruby Bridges,,the first child to desegregate schools in the South --,in this case, New Orleans.,And he said that every day,this six-year-old, dressed in her beautiful dress,,would walk with real grace,through a phalanx of white people,screaming angrily, calling her a monster,,threatening to poison her --,distorted faces.,And every day he would watch her,,and it looked like she was talking to the people.,And he would say, "Ruby, what are you saying?",And she'd say, "I'm not talking.",And finally he said, "Ruby, I see that you're talking.,What are you saying?",And she said, "Dr. Coles, I am not talking;,I'm praying.",And he said, "Well, what are you praying?",And she said, "I'm praying, 'Father, forgive them,,for they know not what they are doing.'",At age six,,this child was living a life of immersion,,and her family paid a price for it.,But she became part of history,and opened up this idea,that all of us should have access to education. 
 My final story is about a young, beautiful man,named Josephat Byaruhanga,,who was another Acumen Fund fellow,,who hails from Uganda, a farming community.,And we placed him in a company in Western Kenya,,just 200 miles away.,And he said to me at the end of his year,,"Jacqueline, it was so humbling,,because I thought as a farmer and as an African,I would understand how to transcend culture.,But especially when I was talking to the African women,,I sometimes made these mistakes --,it was so hard for me to learn how to listen.",And he said, "So I conclude that, in many ways,,leadership is like a panicle of rice.,Because at the height of the season,,at the height of its powers,,it's beautiful, it's green, it nourishes the world,,it reaches to the heavens.",And he said, "But right before the harvest,,it bends over,with great gratitude and humility,to touch the earth from where it came." 
 We need leaders.,We ourselves need to lead,from a place that has the audacity,to believe we can, ourselves,,extend the fundamental assumption,that all men are created equal,to every man, woman and child on this planet.,And we need to have the humility to recognize,that we cannot do it alone.,Robert Kennedy once said,that "few of us have the greatness to bend history itself,,but each of us can work,to change a small portion of events.",And it is in the total of all those acts,that the history of this generation will be written.,Our lives are so short,,and our time on this planet,is so precious,,and all we have is each other.,So may each of you,live lives of immersion.,They won't necessarily be easy lives,,but in the end, it is all that will sustain us. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm actually here,to make a challenge to people.,I know there have been many challenges made to people.,The one I'm going to make,is that it is time for us to reclaim,what peace really means.,Peace is not "Kumbaya, my Lord.",Peace is not the dove and the rainbow --,as lovely as they are.,When I see the symbols,of the rainbow and the dove,,I think of personal serenity.,I think of meditation.,I do not think,about what I consider to be peace,,which is sustainable peace,with justice and equality.,It is a sustainable peace,in which the majority of people,on this planet,have access to enough resources,to live dignified lives,,where these people have enough access,to education,and health care,,so that they can live in freedom from want,and freedom from fear.,This is called human security.,And I am not a complete pacifist,like some of my really, really heavy-duty,,non-violent friends,,like Mairead McGuire.,I understand that humans,are so "messed up" --,to use a nice word,,because I promised my mom,I'd stop using the F-bomb in public.,And I'm trying harder and harder.,Mom, I'm really trying. 
 We need a little bit of police;,we need a little bit of military,,but for defense.,We need to redefine,what makes us secure,in this world.,It is not arming our country,to the teeth.,It is not getting other countries,to arm themselves to the teeth,with the weapons that we produce,and we sell them.,It is using that money more rationally,to make the countries of the world secure,,to make the people of the world secure.,I was thinking about,the recent ongoings,in Congress,,where the president is offering,8.4 billion dollars,to try to get the START vote.,I certainly support the START vote.,But he's offering 84 billion dollars,for the modernizing,of nuclear weapons.,Do you know the figure that the U.N. talks about,for fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals,is 80 billion dollars?,Just that little bit of money,,which to me, I wish it was in my bank account --,it's not, but ...,In global terms, it's a little bit of money.,But it's going to modernize weapons,we do not need,and will not be gotten rid of in our lifetime,,unless we get up off our ...,and take action to make it happen,,unless we begin to believe,that all of the things that we've been hearing about,in these last two days,are elements of what come together,to make human security.,It is saving the tigers.,It is stopping the tar sands.,It is having access,to medical equipment,that can actually tell who does have cancer.,It is all of those things.,It is using our money for all of those things.,It is about action. 
 I was in Hiroshima,a couple of weeks ago,,and His Holiness --,we're sitting there in front of thousands of people in the city,,and there were about eight of us Nobel laureates.,And he's a bad guy. He's like a bad kid in church.,We're staring at everybody, waiting our turn to speak,,and he leans over to me, and he says,,"Jody, I'm a Buddhist monk.",I said, "Yes, Your Holiness.,Your robe gives it away.",(Laughter),He said, "You know,that I kind of like meditation, and I pray.",I said, "That's good. That's good.,We need that in the world.,I don't follow that, but that's cool.",And he says, "But I have become skeptical.,I do not believe,that meditation and prayer,will change this world.,I think what we need,is action.",His Holiness, in his robes,,is my new action hero. 
 I spoke with Aung Sun Suu Kyi,a couple of days ago.,As most of you know,,she's a hero for democracy in her country, Burma.,You probably also know,that she has spent 15 of the last 20 years,imprisoned for her efforts,to bring about democracy.,She was just released a couple of weeks ago,,and we're very concerned to see how long she will be free,,because she is already out in the streets in Rangoon,,agitating for change.,She is already out in the streets, working with the party,to try to rebuild it.,But I talked to her for a range of issues.,But one thing that I want to say,,because it's similar to what His Holiness said.,She said, "You know, we have a long road to go,to finally get democracy in my country.,But I don't believe in hope,without endeavor.,I don't believe in the hope of change,,unless we take action,to make it so." 
 Here's another woman hero of mine.,She's my friend, Dr. Shirin Ebadi,,the first Muslim woman,to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.,She has been in exile,for the last year and a half.,You ask her where she lives -- where does she live in exile?,She says the airports of the world.,She is traveling because she was out of the country,at the time of the elections.,And instead of going home,,she conferred with all the other women that she works with,,who said to her, "Stay out. We need you out.,We need to be able to talk to you out there,,so that you can give the message,of what's happening here.",A year and a half --,she's out speaking,on behalf of the other women in her country. 
 Wangari Maathai --,2004 Peace laureate.,They call her the "Tree Lady,",but she's more than the Tree Lady.,Working for peace,is very creative.,It's hard work every day.,When she was planting those trees,,I don't think most people understand,that, at the same time,,she was using the action,of getting people together to plant those trees,to talk about how to overcome,the authoritarian government in her country.,People could not gather,without getting busted and taken to jail.,But if they were together planting trees for the environment,,it was okay --,creativity.,But it's not just iconic women,like Shirin,,like Aung Sun Suu Kyi, like Wangari Maathai --,it is other women in the world,who are also struggling together,to change this world. 
 The Women's League of Burma,,11 individual organizations of Burmese women,came together because there's strength in numbers.,Working together is what changes our world.,The Million Signatures Campaign,of women inside Burma,working together to change human rights,,to bring democracy to that country.,When one is arrested and taken to prison,,another one comes out and joins the movement,,recognizing that if they work together,,they will ultimately bring change,in their own country. 
 Mairead McGuire in the middle,,Betty Williams on the right-hand side --,bringing peace to Northern Ireland.,I'll tell you the quick story.,An IRA driver was shot,,and his car plowed into people,on the side of the street.,There was a mother and three children.,The children were killed on the spot.,It was Mairead's sister.,Instead of giving in,to grief, depression, defeat,in the face of that violence,,Mairead hooked up with Betty --,a staunch Protestant and a staunch Catholic --,and they took to the streets,to say, "No more violence.",And they were able to get,tens of thousands of, primarily, women, some men,,in the streets to bring about change.,And they have been,part of what brought peace to Northern Ireland,,and they're still working on it,,because there's still a lot more to do. 
 This is Rigoberta Menchu Tum.,She also received the Peace Prize.,She is now running for president.,She is educating the indigenous people of her country,about what it means to be a democracy,,about how you bring democracy to the country,,about educating, about how to vote --,but that democracy is not just about voting;,it's about being an active citizen. 
 That's what I got stuck doing --,the landmine campaign.,One of the things that made this campaign work,is because we grew from two NGOs,to thousands,in 90 countries around the world,,working together in common cause to ban landmines.,Some of the people who worked in our campaign,could only work maybe an hour a month.,They could maybe volunteer that much.,There were others, like myself,,who were full-time.,But it was the actions, together, of all of us,that brought about that change. 
 In my view, what we need today,is people getting up,and taking action,to reclaim the meaning of peace.,It's not a dirty word.,It's hard work every single day.,And if each of us,who cares about the different things we care about,got up off our butts,and volunteered,as much time as we could,,we would change this world,,we would save this world.,And we can't wait for the other guy. We have to do it ourselves. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm going to make an argument today,that may seem a little bit crazy:,social media and the end of gender.,Let me connect the dots.,I'm going to argue today,that the social media applications,that we all know and love, or love to hate,,are actually going to help free us,from some of the absurd assumptions,that we have as a society about gender.,I think that social media,is actually going to help us dismantle,some of the silly and demeaning stereotypes,that we see in media and advertising,about gender. 
 If you hadn't noticed,,our media climate generally provides,a very distorted mirror,of our lives and of our gender,,and I think that's going to change.,Now most media companies --,television, radio, publishing, games, you name it --,they use very rigid segmentation methods,in order to understand their audiences.,It's old-school demographics.,They come up with these very restrictive labels to define us.,Now the crazy thing,is that media companies believe,that if you fall within a certain demographic category,then you are predictable in certain ways --,you have certain taste,,that you like certain things.,And so the bizarre result of this,is that most of our popular culture,is actually based on these presumptions,about our demographics. 
 Age demographics:,the 18 to 49 demo,has had a huge impact,on all mass media programming in this country,since the 1960s,,when the baby boomers were still young.,Now they've aged out of that demographic,,but it's still the case,that powerful ratings companies like Nielson,don't even take into account,viewers of television shows over age 54.,In our media environment,,it's as if they don't even exist.,Now, if you watch "Mad Men," like I do --,it's a popular TV show in the States --,Dr. Faye Miller does something called psychographics,,which first came about in the 1960s,,where you create these complex psychological profiles,of consumers.,But psychographics really haven't had a huge impact on the media business.,It's really just been basic demographics. 
 So I'm at the Norman Lear Center at USC,,and we've done a lot of research over the last seven, eight years,on demographics,and how they affect media and entertainment,in this country and abroad.,And in the last three years,,we've been looking specifically at social media to see what has changed,,and we've discovered some very interesting things.,All the people who participate in social media networks,belong to the same old demographic categories,that media companies and advertisers,have used in order to understand them.,But those categories mean even less now,than they did before,,because with online networking tools,,it's much easier for us,to escape some of our demographic boxes.,We're able to connect with people quite freely,and to redefine ourselves online.,And we can lie about our age online, too, pretty easily.,We can also connect with people,based on our very specific interests.,We don't need a media company,to help do this for us. 
 So the traditional media companies, of course,,are paying very close attention to these online communities.,They know this is the mass audience of the future;,they need to figure it out.,But they're having a hard time doing it,because they're still trying to use demographics in order to understand them,,because that's how ad rates are still determined.,When they're monitoring your clickstream --,and you know they are --,they have a really hard time,figuring out your age, your gender and your income.,They can make some educated guesses.,But they get a lot more information,about what you do online,,what you like, what interests you.,That's easier for them to find out than who you are.,And even though that's still sort of creepy,,there is an upside,to having your taste monitored.,Suddenly our taste is being respected,in a way that it hasn't been before.,It had been presumed before. 
 So when you look online at the way people aggregate,,they don't aggregate,around age, gender and income.,They aggregate around the things they love,,the things that they like,,and if you think about it, shared interests and values,are a far more powerful aggregator of human beings,than demographic categories.,I'd much rather know,whether you like "Buffy the Vampire Slayer",rather than how old you are.,That would tell me something more substantial about you. 
 Now there's something else that we've discovered about social media,that's actually quite surprising.,It turns out that women,are really driving the social media revolution.,If you look at the statistics --,these are worldwide statistics --,in every single age category,,women actually outnumber men,in their use of social networking technologies.,And then if you look at the amount of time,that they spend on these sites,,they truly dominate the social media space,,which is a space that's having a huge impact,on old media.,The question is: what sort of impact,is this going to have on our culture,,and what's it going to mean for women?,If the case is that social media,is dominating old media,and women are dominating social media,,then does that mean that women,are going to take over global media?,Are we suddenly going to see,a lot more female characters in cartoons,and in games and on TV shows?,Will the next big-budget blockbuster movies,actually be chick flicks?,Could this be possible,,that suddenly our media landscape,will become a feminist landscape? 
 Well, I actually don't think that's going to be the case.,I think that media companies are going to hire a lot more women,,because they realize this is important for their business,,and I think that women,are also going to continue to dominate,the social media sphere.,But I think women are actually going to be -- ironically enough --,responsible for driving a stake through the heart,of cheesy genre categories,like the "chick flick",and all these other genre categories,that presume that certain demographic groups,like certain things --,that Hispanics like certain things,,that young people like certain things.,This is far too simplistic.,The future entertainment media that we're going to see,is going to be very data-driven,,and it's going to be based on the information,that we ascertain from taste communities online,,where women are really driving the action. 
 So you may be asking, well why is it important,that I know what entertains people?,Why should I know this?,Of course, old media companies and advertisers,need to know this.,But my argument is that,,if you want to understand the global village,,it's probably a good idea that you figure out,what they're passionate about, what amuses them,,what they choose to do in their free time.,This is a very important thing to know about people.,I've spent most of my professional life,researching media and entertainment,and its impact on people's lives.,And I do it not just because it's fun --,though actually, it is really fun --,but also because,our research has shown over and over again,that entertainment and play,have a huge impact on people's lives --,for instance, on their political beliefs,and on their health.,And so, if you have any interest in understanding the world,,looking at how people amuse themselves,is a really good way to start. 
 So imagine a media atmosphere,that isn't dominated by lame stereotypes,about gender,and other demographic characteristics.,Can you even imagine what that looks like?,I can't wait to find out what it looks like. 
 Thank you so much. 
 (Applause)I am passionate about the American landscape,and how the physical form of the land,,from the great Central Valley of California,to the bedrock of Manhattan,,has really shaped our history and our character.,But one thing is clear.,In the last 100 years alone,,our country -- and this is a sprawl map of America --,our country has systematically,flattened and homogenized the landscape,to the point where we've forgotten,our relationship with the plants and animals,that live alongside us,and the dirt beneath our feet.,And so, how I see my work contributing,is sort of trying to literally re-imagine these connections,and physically rebuild them.,This graph represents what we're dealing with now,in the built environment.,And it's really a conflux,of urban population rising,,biodiversity plummeting,and also, of course, sea levels rising,and climate changing. 
 So when I also think about design,,I think about,trying to rework and re-engage,the lines on this graph,in a more productive way.,And you can see from the arrow here,indicating "you are here,",I'm trying to sort of blend and meld,these two very divergent fields,of urbanism and ecology,,and sort of bring them together in an exciting new way.,So the era of big infrastructure is over.,I mean, these sort of top-down,,mono-functional, capital-intensive solutions,are really not going to cut it.,We need new tools and new approaches.,Similarly, the idea of architecture,as this sort of object in the field,,devoid of context,,is really not the --,excuse me, it's fairly blatant --,is really not the approach,that we need to take.,So we need new stories,,new heroes and new tools. 
 So now I want to introduce you to my new hero,in the global climate change war,,and that is the eastern oyster.,So, albeit a very small creature,and very modest,,this creature is incredible,,because it can agglomerate,into these mega-reef structures.,It can grow; you can grow it;,and -- did I mention? -- it's quite tasty.,So the oyster was the basis,for a manifesto-like urban design project,that I did about the New York Harbor,called "oyster-tecture.",And the core idea of oyster-tecture is to harness the biological power,of mussels, eelgrass and oysters --,species that live in the harbor --,and, at the same time,,harness the power of people,who live in the community,towards making change now. 
 Here's a map of my city, New York City,,showing inundation in red.,And what's circled is the site that I'm going to talk about,,the Gowanus Canal and Governors Island.,If you look here at this map,,showing everything in blue,is out in the water,,and everything in yellow is upland.,But you can see, even just intuit, from this map,,that the harbor has dredged and flattened,,and went from a rich, three-dimensional mosaic to flat muck,in really a matter of years.,Another set of views of actually the Gowanus Canal itself.,Now the Gowanus is particularly smelly -- I will admit it.,There are problems of sewage overflow,and contamination,,but I would also argue that almost every city,has this exact condition,,and it's a condition that we're all facing.,And here's a map of that condition,,showing the contaminants in yellow and green,,exacerbated by this new flow of,storm-surge and sea-level rise.,So we really had a lot to deal with. 
 When we started this project,,one of the core ideas was to look back in history,and try to understand what was there.,And you can see from this map,,there's this incredible geographical signature,of a series of islands,that were out in the harbor,and a matrix of salt marshes and beaches,that served as natural wave attenuation,for the upland settlement.,We also learned at this time,that you could eat an oyster about the size of a dinner plate,in the Gowanus Canal itself.,So our concept is really this back-to-the-future concept,,harnessing the intelligence of that land settlement pattern.,And the idea has two core stages.,One is to develop a new artificial ecology,,a reef out in the harbor,,that would then protect new settlement patterns,inland and the Gowanus.,Because if you have cleaner water and slower water,,you can imagine a new way of living with that water. 
 So the project really addresses these three core issues,in a new and exciting way, I think.,Here we are, back to our hero, the oyster.,And again, it's this incredibly exciting animal.,It accepts algae and detritus in one end,,and through this beautiful, glamorous,set of stomach organs,,out the other end comes cleaner water.,And one oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of water a day.,Oyster reefs also covered,about a quarter of our harbor,and were capable of filtering water in the harbor in a matter of days.,They were key in our culture and our economy.,Basically, New York was built,on the backs of oystermen,,and our streets were literally built over oyster shells.,This image,is an image of an oyster cart,,which is now as ubiquitous as the hotdog cart is today.,So again, we got the short end of the deal there.,(Laughter),Finally, oysters can attenuate,and agglomerate onto each other,and form these amazing natural reef structures.,They really become nature's wave attenuators.,And they become the bedrock,of any harbor ecosystem.,Many, many species depend on them. 
 So we were inspired by the oyster,,but I was also inspired by the life cycle of the oyster.,It can move from a fertilized egg,to a spat, which is when they're floating through the water,,and when they're ready to attach onto another oyster,,to an adult male oyster or female oyster,,in a number of weeks.,We reinterpreted this life cycle,on the scale of our sight,and took the Gowanus,as a giant oyster nursery,where oysters would be grown up in the Gowanus,,then paraded down in their spat stage,and seeded out on the Bayridge Reef.,And so the core idea here,was to hit the reset button,and regenerate an ecology over time,that was regenerative and cleaning,and productive. 
 How does the reef work? Well, it's very, very simple.,A core concept here,is that climate change,isn't something that --,the answers won't land down from the Moon.,And with a $20 billion price tag,,we should simply start and get to work with what we have now,and what's in front of us.,So this image is simply showing --,it's a field of marine piles,interconnected with this woven fuzzy rope.,What is fuzzy rope, you ask?,It's just that; it's this very inexpensive thing,,available practically at your hardware store, and it's very cheap.,So we imagine that we would actually,potentially even host a bake sale,to start our new project.,(Laughter),So in the studio, rather than drawing,,we began to learn how to knit.,The concept was to really knit this rope together,and develop this new soft infrastructure,for the oysters to grow on.,You can see in the diagram how it grows over time,from an infrastructural space,into a new public urban space.,And that grows over time dynamically,with the threat of climate change. 
 It also creates this incredibly interesting, I think,,new amphibious public space,,where you can imagine working,,you can imagine recreating in a new way.,In the end, what we realized we were making,was a new blue-green watery park,for the next watery century --,an amphibious park, if you will.,So get your Tevas on.,So you can imagine scuba diving here.,This is an image of high school students,,scuba divers that we worked with on our team.,So you can imagine a sort of new manner of living,with a new relationship with the water,,and also a hybridizing of recreational and science programs,in terms of monitoring. 
 Another new vocabulary word for the brave new world:,this is the word "flupsy" --,it's short for "floating upwelling system.",And this glorious, readily available device,is basically a floating raft,with an oyster nursery below.,So the water is churned through this raft.,You can see the eight chambers on the side,host little baby oysters and essentially force-feed them.,So rather than having 10 oysters,,you have 10,000 oysters.,And then those spat are then seeded.,Here's the Gowanus future,with the oyster rafts on the shorelines --,the flupsification of the Gowanus.,New word.,And also showing oyster gardening for the community,along its edges.,And finally, how much fun it would be,to watch the flupsy parade,and cheer on the oyster spats,as they go down to the reef. 
 I get asked two questions about this project.,One is: why isn't it happening now?,And the second one is: when can we eat the oysters?,And the answer is: not yet, they're working.,But we imagine, with our calculations,,that by 2050,,you might be able to sink your teeth into a Gowanus oyster. 
 To conclude, this is just one cross-section,of one piece of city,,but my dream is, my hope is,,that when you all go back to your own cities,that we can start to work together and collaborate,on remaking and reforming,a new urban landscape,towards a more sustainable, a more livable,and a more delicious future. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Now I'm going to give you a story.,It's an Indian story about an Indian woman and her journey.,Let me begin with my parents.,I'm a product of this,visionary mother and father.,Many years ago, when I was born in the '50s --,'50s and '60s,didn't belong to girls in India.,They belonged to boys.,They belonged to boys who would join business,and inherit business from parents,,and girls would be dolled up to get married.,My family, in my city,,and almost in the country, was unique.,We were four of us, not one,,and fortunately no boys.,We were four girls and no boys.,And my parents were part,of a landed property family.,My father defied his own grandfather,,almost to the point of disinheritance,,because he decided to educate,all four of us.,He sent us to one of the best schools in the city,and gave us the best education.,As I've said, when we're born, we don't choose our parents,,and when we go to school, we don't choose our school.,Children don't choose a school.,They just get the school which parents choose for them.,So this is the foundation time which I got.,I grew up like this, and so did my other three sisters.,And my father used to say at that time,,"I'm going to spread all my four daughters in four corners of the world.",I don't know if he really meant [that], but it happened.,I'm the only one who's left in India.,One is a British, another is an American,and the third is a Canadian.,So we are four of us in four corners of the world. 
 And since I said they're my role models,,I followed two things which my father and mother gave me.,One, they said, "Life is on an incline.,You either go up,,or you come down.",And the second thing, which has stayed with me,,which became my philosophy of life,,which made all the difference,,is: 100 things happen in your life, good or bad.,Out of 100, 90 are your creation.,They're good. They're your creation. Enjoy it.,If they're bad, they're your creation. Learn from it.,Ten are nature-sent over which you can't do a thing.,It's like a death of a relative,,or a cyclone, or a hurricane, or an earthquake.,You can't do a thing about it.,You've got to just respond to the situation.,But that response comes out of those 90 points.,Since I'm a product of this philosophy,,of 90/10,,and secondly, "life on an incline,",that's the way I grew up,to be valuing what I got.,I'm a product of opportunities,,rare opportunities in the '50s and the '60s,,which girls didn't get,,and I was conscious of the fact that what my parents were giving me,was something unique.,Because all of my best school friends were getting dolled up,to get married with a lot of dowry,,and here I was with a tennis racket and going to school,and doing all kinds of extracurricular activities.,I thought I must tell you this.,Why I said this, is the background. 
 This is what comes next.,I joined the Indian Police Service as a tough woman,,a woman with indefatigable stamina,,because I used to run for my tennis titles, etc.,But I joined the Indian Police Service,,and then it was a new pattern of policing.,For me the policing stood for power to correct,,power to prevent and power to detect.,This is something like a new definition ever given in policing in India --,the power to prevent.,Because normally it was always said, power to detect, and that's it,,or power to punish.,But I decided no, it's a power to prevent,,because that's what I learned when I was growing up.,How do I prevent the 10 and never make it more than 10?,So this was how it came into my service,,and it was different from the men.,I didn't want to make it different from the men, but it was different,,because this was the way I was different.,And I redefined policing concepts in India.,I'm going to take you on two journeys,,my policing journey and my prison journey.,What you see, if you see the title,called "PM's car held.",This was the first time a prime minister of India,was given a parking ticket.,(Laughter),That's the first time in India,,and I can tell you, that's the last time you're hearing about it.,It'll never happen again in India,,because now it was once and forever.,And the rule was, because I was sensitive,,I was compassionate, I was very sensitive to injustice,,and I was very pro-justice.,That's the reason, as a woman, I joined the Indian Police Service.,I had other options, but I didn't choose them. 
 So I'm going to move on.,This is about tough policing, equal policing.,Now I was known as "here's a woman that's not going to listen.",So I was sent to all indiscriminate postings,,postings which others would say no.,I now went to a prison assignment as a police officer.,Normally police officers don't want to do prison.,They sent me to prison to lock me up,,thinking, "Now there will be no cars,and no VIPs to be given tickets to.,Let's lock her up.",Here I got a prison assignment.,This was a prison assignment which was one big den of criminals.,Obviously, it was.,But 10,000 men,,of which only 400 were women -- 10,000 --,9,000 plus about 600,were men.,Terrorists, rapists,,burglars, gangsters --,some of them I'd sent to jail,as a police officer outside.,And then how did I deal with them?,The first day when I went in,,I didn't know how to look at them.,And I said, "Do you pray?" When I looked at the group, I said, "Do you pray?",They saw me as a young, short woman wearing a pathan suit.,I said, "Do you pray?",And they didn't say anything.,I said, "Do you pray? Do you want to pray?",They said, "Yes." I said, "All right, let's pray.",I prayed for them, and things started to change.,This is a visual of education inside the prison. 
 Friends, this has never happened,,where everybody in the prison studies.,I started this with community support.,Government had no budget.,It was one of the finest, largest volunteerism,in any prison in the world.,This was initiated in Delhi prison.,You see one sample,of a prisoner teaching a class.,These are hundreds of classes.,Nine to eleven, every prisoner went into the education program --,the same den in which they thought,they would put me behind the bar and things would be forgotten.,We converted this into an ashram --,from a prison to an ashram through education.,I think that's the bigger change.,It was the beginning of a change.,Teachers were prisoners. Teachers were volunteers.,Books came from donated schoolbooks.,Stationery was donated.,Everything was donated,,because there was no budget of education for the prison.,Now if I'd not done that,,it would have been a hellhole. 
 That's the second landmark.,I want to show you some moments of history in my journey,,which probably you would never ever get to see anywhere in the world.,One, the numbers you'll never get to see.,Secondly, this concept.,This was a meditation program inside the prison,of over 1,000 prisoners.,One thousand prisoners who sat in meditation.,This was one of the most courageous steps,I took as a prison governor.,And this is what transformed.,You want to know more about this,,go and see this film, "Doing Time, Doing Vipassana.",You will hear about it, and you will love it.,And write to me on KiranBedi.com,,and I'll respond to you.,Let me show you the next slide.,I took the same concept of mindfulness,,because, why did I bring meditation into the Indian prison?,Because crime is a product of a distorted mind.,It was distortion of mind which needed to be addressed to control.,Not by preaching, not by telling,,not by reading, but by addressing your mind.,I took the same thing to the police,,because police, equally, were prisoners of their minds,,and they felt as if it was "we" and "they,",and that the people don't cooperate.,This worked. 
 This is a feedback box called a petition box.,This is a concept which I introduced,to listen to complaints, listen to grievances.,This was a magic box.,This was a sensitive box.,This is how a prisoner drew how they felt about the prison.,If you see somebody in the blue --,yeah, this guy --,he was a prisoner, and he was a teacher.,And you see, everybody's busy. There was no time to waste. 
 Let me wrap it up.,I'm currently into movements,,movements of education,of the under-served children,,which is thousands -- India is all about thousands.,Secondly is about the anti-corruption movement in India.,That's a big way,we, as a small group of activists,,have drafted an ombudsman bill for the government of India.,Friends, you will hear a lot about it.,That's the movement at the moment I'm driving,,and that's the movement and ambition of my life. 
 Thank you very much.,(Applause),Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.,Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.Pat Mitchell: What is the story of this pin? 
 Madeleine Albright: This is "Breaking the Glass Ceiling." 
 PM: Oh.,That was well chosen, I would say, for TEDWomen. 
 MA: Most of the time I spend when I get up in the morning,is trying to figure out what is going to happen.,And none of this pin stuff would have happened,if it hadn't been for Saddam Hussein.,I'll tell you what happened.,I went to the United Nations as an ambassador,,and it was after the Gulf War,,and I was an instructed ambassador.,And the cease-fire had been translated,into a series of sanctions resolutions,,and my instructions,were to say perfectly terrible things about Saddam Hussein constantly,,which he deserved -- he had invaded another country.,And so all of a sudden, a poem appeared in the papers in Baghdad,comparing me to many things,,but among them an "unparalleled serpent.",And so I happened to have a snake pin.,So I wore it when we talked about Iraq.,(Laughter),And when I went out to meet the press,,they zeroed in, said, "Why are you wearing that snake pin?",I said, "Because Saddam Hussein compared me to an unparalleled serpent.",And then I thought, well this is fun.,So I went out and I bought a lot of pins,that would, in fact, reflect,what I thought we were going to do on any given day.,So that's how it all started. 
 PM: So how large is the collection? 
 MA: Pretty big.,It's now traveling.,At the moment it's in Indianapolis,,but it was at the Smithsonian.,And it goes with a book that says, "Read My Pins." 
 (Laughter) 
 PM: So is this a good idea.,I remember when you were the first woman,as Secretary of State,,and there was a lot of conversation always,about what you were wearing,,how you looked --,the thing that happens to a lot of women,,especially if they're the first in a position.,So how do you feel about that -- the whole -- 
 MA: Well, it's pretty irritating actually,because nobody ever describes what a man is wearing.,But people did pay attention to what clothes I had.,What was interesting was that,,before I went up to New York as U.N. ambassador,,I talked to Jeane Kirkpatrick, who'd been ambassador before me,,and she said, "You've got to get rid of your professor clothes.,Go out and look like a diplomat.",So that did give me a lot of opportunities to go shopping.,But still, there were all kinds of questions,about -- "did you wear a hat?" "How short was your skirt?",And one of the things --,if you remember Condoleezza Rice was at some event and she wore boots,,and she got criticized over that.,And no guy ever gets criticized. But that's the least of it. 
 PM: It is, for all of us, men and women,,finding our ways of defining our roles,,and doing them in ways that make a difference in the world,and shape the future.,How did you handle that balance,between being the tough diplomatic,and strong voice of this country,to the rest of the world,and also how you felt about yourself,as a mother, a grandmother, nurturing ...,and so how did you handle that? 
 MA: Well the interesting part was I was asked,what it was like to be the first woman Secretary of State,a few minutes after I'd been named.,And I said, "Well I've been a woman for 60 years,,but I've only been Secretary of State for a few minutes.",So it evolved.,(Laughter),But basically I love being a woman.,And so what happened --,and I think there will probably be some people in the audience,that will identify with this --,I went to my first meeting, first at the U.N.,,and that's when this all started,,because that is a very male organization.,And I'm sitting there -- there are 15 members of the Security Council --,so 14 men sat there staring at me,,and I thought -- well you know how we all are.,You want to get the feeling of the room,,and "do people like me?",and "will I really say something intelligent?",And all of a sudden I thought, "Well, wait a minute.,I am sitting behind a sign that says 'The United States,',and if I don't speak today,then the voice of the United States will not be heard,",and it was the first time that I had that feeling,that I had to step out of myself,in my normal, reluctant female mode,and decide that I had to speak on behalf of our country.,And so that happened more at various times,,but I really think that there was a great advantage in many ways,to being a woman.,I think we are a lot better,at personal relationships,,and then have the capability obviously,of telling it like it is when it's necessary.,But I have to tell you, I have my youngest granddaughter,,when she turned seven last year,,said to her mother, my daughter,,"So what's the big deal about Grandma Maddie being Secretary of State?,Only girls are Secretary of State." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 PM: Because in her lifetime -- MA: That would be so. 
 PM: What a change that is.,As you travel now all over the world,,which you do frequently,,how do you assess,this global narrative around the story of women and girls?,Where are we? 
 MA: I think we're slowly changing,,but obviously there are whole pockets,in countries where nothing is different.,And therefore it means that we have to remember,that, while many of us have had huge opportunities --,and Pat, you have been a real leader in your field --,is that there are a lot of women,that are not capable,of worrying and taking care of themselves,and understanding that women have to help other women.,And so what I have felt --,and I have looked at this,from a national security issue --,when I was Secretary of State, I decided,that women's issues had to be central to American foreign policy,,not just because I'm a feminist,,but because I believe that societies are better off,when women are politically and economically empowered,,that values are passed down,,the health situation is better,,education is better,,there is greater economic prosperity.,So I think that it behooves us --,those of us that live in various countries,where we do have economic and political voice --,that we need to help other women.,And I really dedicated myself to that,,both at the U.N. and then as Secretary of State. 
 PM: And did you get pushback,from making that a central tenant of foreign policy? 
 MA: From some people.,I think that they thought that it was a soft issue.,The bottom line that I decided,was actually women's issues are the hardest issues,,because they are the ones that have to do with life and death,in so many aspects,,and because, as I said,,it is really central to the way that we think about things.,Now for instance,,some of the wars that took place,when I was in office,,a lot of them, the women were the main victims of it.,For instance, when I started,,there were wars in the Balkans.,The women in Bosnia were being raped.,We then managed to set up a war crimes tribunal,to deal specifically with those kinds of issues.,And by the way, one of the things that I did at that stage,was, I had just arrived at the U.N.,,and when I was there, there were 183 countries in the U.N.,Now there are 192.,But it was one of the first times that I didn't have to cook lunch myself.,So I said to my assistant,,"Invite the other women permanent representatives.",And I thought when I'd get to my apartment,that there'd be a lot of women there.,I get there, and there are six other women, out of 183.,So the countries that had women representatives,were Canada, Kazakhstan, Philippines,,Trinidad Tobago, Jamaica,,Lichtenstein and me.,So being an American, I decided to set up a caucus.,(Laughter),And so we set it up,,and we called ourselves the G7. 
 (Laughter) 
 PM: Is that "Girl 7?" MA: Girl 7. 
 And we lobbied,on behalf of women's issues.,So we managed to get two women judges,on this war crimes tribunal.,And then what happened,was that they were able to declare that rape was a weapon of war,,that it was against humanity. 
 (Applause) 
 PM: So when you look around the world,and you see that, in many cases --,certainly in the Western world --,women are evolving into more leadership positions,,and even other places,some barriers are being brought down,,but there's still so much violence,,still so many problems,,and yet we hear there are more women,at the negotiating tables.,Now you were at those negotiating tables,when they weren't, when there was maybe you --,one voice, maybe one or two others.,Do you believe, and can you tell us why,,there is going to be a significant shift,in things like violence,and peace and conflict and resolution,on a sustainable basis? 
 MA: Well I do think, when there are more women,,that the tone of the conversation changes,,and also the goals of the conversation change.,But it doesn't mean that the whole world,would be a lot better,if it were totally run by women.,If you think that, you've forgotten high school.,(Laughter),But the bottom line,is that there is a way,,when there are more women at the table,,that there's an attempt,to develop some understanding.,So for instance, what I did when I went to Burundi,,we'd got Tutsi and Hutu women together,to talk about some of the problems,that had taken place in Rwanda.,And so I think the capability of women,to put themselves --,I think we're better about putting ourselves into the other guy's shoes,and having more empathy.,I think it helps in terms of the support,if there are other women in the room. 
 When I was Secretary of State,,there were only 13 other women foreign ministers.,And so it was nice when one of them would show up.,For instance, she is now the president of Finland,,but Tarja Halonen was the foreign minister of Finland,and, at a certain stage, head of the European Union.,And it was really terrific.,Because one of the things I think you'll understand.,We went to a meeting,,and the men in my delegation,,when I would say, "Well I feel we should do something about this,",and they'd say, "What do you mean, you feel?",And so then Tarja was sitting across the table from me.,And all of a sudden we were talking about arms control,,and she said, "Well I feel we should do this.",And my male colleagues kind of got it all of a sudden.,But I think it really does help,to have a critical mass of women,in a series of foreign policy positions.,The other thing that I think is really important:,A lot of national security policy,isn't just about foreign policy,,but it's about budgets, military budgets,,and how the debts of countries work out.,So if you have women,in a variety of foreign policy posts,,they can support each other,when there are budget decisions being made in their own countries. 
 PM: So how do we get,this balance we're looking for, then, in the world?,More women's voices at the table?,More men who believe,that the balance is best? 
 MA: Well I think one of the things --,I'm chairman of the board of an organization,called the National Democratic Institute,that works to support women candidates.,I think that we need,to help in other countries,to train women,to be in political office,,to figure out how they can in fact,develop political voices.,I think we also need to be supportive,when businesses are being created,and just make sure that women help each other.,Now I have a saying,that I feel very strongly about,,because I am of a certain age,where, when I started in my career,,believe it or not, there were other women who criticized me:,"Why aren't you in the carpool line?",or "Aren't your children suffering,because you're not there all the time?",And I think we have a tendency to make each other feel guilty.,In fact, I think "guilt" is every woman's middle name.,And so I think what needs to happen,is we need to help each other.,And my motto is that there's a special place in hell,for women who don't help each other. 
 (Applause) 
 PM: Well Secretary Albright, I guess you'll be going to heaven.,Thank you for joining us today. 
 MA: Thank you all. Thanks Pat. 
 (Applause)Hawa Abdi: Many people -- 20 years for Somalia --,[were] fighting.,So there was no job, no food.,Children, most of them,,became very malnourished, like this.,Deqo Mohamed: So as you know,,always in a civil war,,the ones affected most [are] the women and children.,So our patients are women and children.,And they are in our backyard.,It's our home. We welcome them.,That's the camp that we have in now,90,000 people,,where 75 percent of them are women and children.,Pat Mitchell: And this is your hospital. This is the inside.,HA: We are doing C-sections and different operations,because people need some help.,There is no government to protect them.,DM: Every morning we have about 400 patients,,maybe more or less.,But sometimes we are only five doctors,and 16 nurses,,and we are physically getting exhausted to see all of them.,But we take the severe ones,,and we reschedule the other ones the next day.,It is very tough.,And as you can see, it's the women who are carrying the children;,it's the women who come into the hospitals;,it's the women [are] building the houses.,That's their house.,And we have a school. This is our bright --,we opened [in the] last two years [an] elementary school,where we have 850 children,,and the majority are women and girls.,(Applause),PM: And the doctors have some very big rules,about who can get treated at the clinic.,Would you explain the rules for admission?,HA: The people who are coming to us,,we are welcoming.,We are sharing with them,whatever we have.,But there are only two rules.,First rule:,there is no clan distinguished and political division,in Somali society.,[Whomever] makes those things we throw out.,The second:,no man can beat his wife.,If he beat,,we will put [him] in jail,,and we will call the eldest people.,Until they identify this case,,we'll never release him.,That's our two rules.,(Applause),The other thing that I have realized,,that the woman is the most strong person,all over the world.,Because the last 20 years,,the Somali woman has stood up.,They were the leaders,,and we are the leaders,of our community,and the hope of our future generations.,We are not just the helpless,and the victims of the civil war.,We can reconcile.,We can do everything.,(Applause),DM: As my mother said, we are the future hope,,and the men are only killing in Somalia.,So we came up with these two rules.,In a camp with 90,000 people,,you have to come up with some rules or there is going to be some fights.,So there is no clan division,,and no man can beat his wife.,And we have a little storage room,where we converted a jail.,So if you beat your wife, you're going to be there.,(Applause),So empowering the women and giving the opportunity --,we are there for them. They are not alone for this.,PM: You're running a medical clinic.,It brought much, much needed medical care,to people who wouldn't get it.,You're also running a civil society.,You've created your own rules,,in which women and children,are getting a different sense of security.,Talk to me about your decision, Dr. Abdi,,and your decision, Dr. Mohamed,,to work together --,for you to become a doctor,and to work with your mother in these circumstances.,HA: My age --,because I was born in 1947 --,we were having, at that time,,government, law and order.,But one day, I went to the hospital --,my mother was sick --,and I saw the hospital, how they [were] treating the doctors,,how they [are] committed,to help the sick people.,I admired them,,and I decided to become a doctor.,My mother died, unfortunately,,when I was 12 years [old].,Then my father allowed me,to proceed [with] my hope.,My mother died,in [a] gynecology complication,,so I decided to become,a gynecology specialist.,That's why I became a doctor.,So Dr. Deqo has to explain.,DM: For me, my mother was preparing [me] when I was a child,to become a doctor, but I really didn't want to.,Maybe I should become an historian,,or maybe a reporter.,I loved it, but it didn't work.,When the war broke out -- civil war --,I saw how my mother was helping,and how she really needed the help,,and how the care is essential to the woman,to be a woman doctor in Somalia,and help the women and children.,And I thought, maybe I can be a reporter and doctor gynecologist.,(Laughter),So I went to Russia, and my mother also,,[during the] time of [the] Soviet Union.,So some of our character,,maybe we will come with a strong Soviet background of training.,So that's how I decided [to do] the same.,My sister was different.,She's here. She's also a doctor.,She graduated in Russia also.,(Applause),And to go back and to work with our mother,is just what we saw in the civil war --,when I was 16, and my sister was 11,,when the civil war broke out.,So it was the need and the people we saw,in the early '90s --,that's what made us go back,and work for them.,PM: So what is the biggest challenge,working, mother and daughter,,in such dangerous,and sometimes scary situations?,HA: Yes, I was working in a tough situation,,very dangerous.,And when I saw the people who needed me,,I was staying with them to help,,because I [could] do something for them.,Most people fled abroad.,But I remained with those people,,and I was trying to do something --,[any] little thing I [could] do.,I succeeded in my place.,Now my place is 90,000 people,who are respecting each other,,who are not fighting.,But we try to stand on our feet,,to do something, little things, we can for our people.,And I'm thankful for my daughters.,When they come to me,,they help me to treat the people,,to help.,They do everything for them.,They have done what I desire to do for them.,PM: What's the best part,of working with your mother,,and the most challenging part for you?,DM: She's very tough; it's most challenging.,She always expects us to do more.,And really when you think [you] cannot do it,,she will push you, and I can do it.,That's the best part.,She shows us, trains us how to do,and how to be better [people],and how to do long hours in surgery --,300 patients per day,,10, 20 surgeries,,and still you have to manage the camp --,that's how she trains us.,It is not like beautiful offices here,,20 patients, you're tired.,You see 300 patients, 20 surgeries,and 90,000 people to manage.,PM: But you do it for good reasons.,(Applause),Wait. Wait.,HA: Thank you.,DM: Thank you.,(Applause),HA: Thank you very much. DM: Thank you very much.I just did something I've never done before.,I spent a week at sea on a research vessel.,Now I'm not a scientist,,but I was accompanying a remarkable scientific team,from the University of South Florida,who have been tracking the travels of BP's oil,in the Gulf of Mexico.,This is the boat we were on, by the way.,The scientists I was with,were not studying the effect of the oil and dispersants on the big stuff --,the birds, the turtles,,the dolphins, the glamorous stuff.,They're looking at the really little stuff,that gets eaten by the slightly less little stuff,that eventually gets eaten by the big stuff.,And what they're finding,is that even trace amounts of oil and dispersants,can be highly toxic to phytoplankton,,which is very bad news,,because so much life depends on it.,So contrary to what we heard a few months back,about how 75 percent of that oil,sort of magically disappeared,and we didn't have to worry about it,,this disaster is still unfolding.,It's still working its way up the food chain.,Now this shouldn't come as a surprise to us.,Rachel Carson --,the godmother of modern environmentalism --,warned us about this very thing,back in 1962.,She pointed out that the "control men" --,as she called them --,who carpet-bombed towns and fields,with toxic insecticides like DDT,,were only trying to kill the little stuff, the insects,,not the birds.,But they forgot this:,the fact that birds dine on grubs,,that robins eat lots of worms,now saturated with DDT.,And so, robin eggs failed to hatch,,songbirds died en masse,,towns fell silent.,Thus the title "Silent Spring.",I've been trying to pinpoint,what keeps drawing me back to the Gulf of Mexico,,because I'm Canadian,,and I can draw no ancestral ties.,And I think what it is,is I don't think we have fully come to terms,with the meaning of this disaster,,with what it meant to witness a hole,ripped in our world,,with what it meant to watch the contents of the Earth,gush forth on live TV,,24 hours a day,,for months.,After telling ourselves for so long,that our tools and technology can control nature,,suddenly we were face-to-face,with our weakness,,with our lack of control,,as the oil burst out,of every attempt to contain it --,"top hats," "top kills",and, most memorably, the "junk shot" --,the bright idea,of firing old tires and golf balls,down that hole in the world.,But even more striking,than the ferocious power emanating from that well,was the recklessness,with which that power was unleashed --,the carelessness, the lack of planning,that characterized the operation,from drilling to clean-up.,If there is one thing,BP's watery improv act made clear,,it is that, as a culture,,we have become far too willing to gamble,with things that are precious,and irreplaceable,,and to do so without a back-up plan,,without an exit strategy.,And BP was hardly,our first experience of this in recent years.,Our leaders barrel into wars,,telling themselves happy stories,about cakewalks and welcome parades.,Then, it is years of deadly damage control,,Frankensteins of sieges and surges,and counter-insurgencies,,and once again, no exit strategy.,Our financial wizards routinely fall victim,to similar overconfidence,,convincing themselves that the latest bubble,is a new kind of market --,the kind that never goes down.,And when it inevitably does,,the best and the brightest,reach for the financial equivalent of the junk shot --,in this case, throwing massive amounts,of much-needed public money,down a very different kind of hole.,As with BP, the hole does get plugged,,at least temporarily,,but not before,exacting a tremendous price.,We have to figure out,why we keep letting this happen,,because we are in the midst,of what may be our highest-stakes gamble of all --,deciding what to do, or not to do,,about climate change.,Now as you know,,a great deal of time is spent,,in this country and around the world,,inside the climate debate,,on the question of, "What if the IPC scientists,are all wrong?",Now a far more relevant question --,as MIT physicist Evelyn Fox Keller puts it --,is, "What if those scientists are right?",Given the stakes, the climate crisis,clearly calls for us to act,based on the precautionary principle --,the theory that holds,that when human health and the environment,are significantly at risk,and when the potential damage is irreversible,,we cannot afford to wait,for perfect scientific certainty.,Better to err on the side of caution.,More overt, the burden of proving,that a practice is safe,should not be placed on the public that would be harmed,,but rather on the industry that stands to profit.,But climate policy in the wealthy world --,to the extent that such a thing exists --,is not based on precaution,,but rather on cost-benefit analysis --,finding the course of action that economists believe,will have the least impact,on our GDP.,So rather than asking, as precaution would demand,,what can we do as quickly as possible,to avoid potential catastrophe,,we ask bizarre questions like this:,"What is the latest possible moment we can wait,before we begin seriously lowering emissions?,Can we put this off till 2020,,2030, 2050?",Or we ask,,"How much hotter can we let the planet get,and still survive?,Can we go with two degrees, three degrees, or --,where we're currently going --,four degrees Celsius?",And by the way,,the assumption that we can safely control,the Earth's awesomely complex climate system,as if it had a thermostat,,making the planet not too hot, not too cold,,but just right -- sort of Goldilocks style --,this is pure fantasy,,and it's not coming from the climate scientists.,It's coming from the economists,imposing their mechanistic thinking,on the science.,The fact is that we simply don't know,when the warming that we create,will be utterly overwhelmed,by feedback loops.,So once again,,why do we take these crazy risks,with the precious?,A range of explanations,may be popping into your mind by now,,like "greed.",This is a popular explanation, and there's lots of truth to it,,because taking big risks, as we all know,,pays a lot of money.,Another explanation that you often hear for recklessness,is hubris.,And greed and hubris,are intimately intertwined,when it comes to recklessness.,For instance, if you happen to be a 35-year-old banker,taking home 100 times more,than a brain surgeon,,then you need a narrative,,you need a story,that makes that disparity okay.,And you actually don't have a lot of options.,You're either an incredibly good scammer,,and you're getting away with it -- you gamed the system --,or you're some kind of boy genius,,the likes of which the world has never seen.,Now both of these options -- the boy genius and the scammer --,are going to make you vastly overconfident,and therefore more prone,to taking even bigger risks in the future.,By the way, Tony Hayward, the former CEO of BP,,had a plaque on his desk,inscribed with this inspirational slogan:,"What would you attempt to do,if you knew you could not fail?",Now this is actually a popular plaque,,and this is a crowd of overachievers,,so I'm betting that some of you have this plaque.,Don't feel ashamed.,Putting fear of failure out of your mind,can be a very good thing,if you're training for a triathlon,or preparing to give a TEDTalk,,but personally, I think people with the power,to detonate our economy and ravage our ecology,would do better having,a picture of Icarus hanging from the wall,,because -- maybe not that one in particular --,but I want them thinking about the possibility of failure,all of the time.,So we have greed,,we've got overconfidence/hubris,,but since we're here at TEDWomen,,let's consider one other factor,that could be contributing in some small way,to societal recklessness.,Now I'm not going to belabor this point,,but studies do show that, as investors,,women are much less prone,to taking reckless risks than men,,precisely because, as we've already heard,,women tend not to suffer from overconfidence,in the same way that men do.,So it turns out,that being paid less and praised less,has its upsides --,for society at least.,The flipside of this,is that constantly being told,that you are gifted, chosen,and born to rule,has distinct societal downsides.,And this problem -- call it the "perils of privilege" --,brings us closer, I think,,to the root of our collective recklessness.,Because none of us -- at least in the global North --,neither men nor women,,are fully exempt from this message.,Here's what I'm talking about.,Whether we actively believe them,or consciously reject them,,our culture remains in the grips,of certain archetypal stories,about our supremacy,over others and over nature --,the narrative of the newly discovered frontier,and the conquering pioneer,,the narrative of manifest destiny,,the narrative of apocalypse and salvation.,And just when you think these stories are fading into history,,and that we've gotten over them,,they pop up in the strangest places.,For instance, I stumbled across this advertisement,outside the women's washroom,in the Kansas City airport.,It's for Motorola's new Rugged cell phone,,and yes, it really does say,,"Slap Mother Nature in the face.",And I'm not just showing it to pick on Motorola --,that's just a bonus.,I'm showing it because --,they're not a sponsor, are they? --,because, in its own way,,this is a crass version,of our founding story.,We slapped Mother Nature around and won,,and we always win,,because dominating nature is our destiny.,But this is not the only fairytale we tell ourselves about nature.,There's another one, equally important,,about how that very same Mother Nature,is so nurturing and so resilient,that we can never make a dent in her abundance.,Let's hear from Tony Hayward again.,"The Gulf of Mexico is a very big ocean.,The amount of oil and dispersants that we are putting into it,is tiny in relation to the total water volume.",In other words, the ocean is big;,she can take it.,It is this underlying assumption of limitlessness,that makes it possible,to take the reckless risks that we do.,Because this is our real master-narrative:,however much we mess up,,there will always be more --,more water, more land,,more untapped resources.,A new bubble will replace the old one.,A new technology will come along,to fix the messes we made with the last one.,In a way, that is the story,of the settling of the Americas,,the supposedly inexhaustible frontier,to which Europeans escaped.,And it's also the story of modern capitalism,,because it was the wealth from this land,that gave birth to our economic system,,one that cannot survive without perpetual growth,and an unending supply,of new frontiers.,Now the problem is,that the story was always a lie.,The Earth always did have limits.,They were just beyond our sights.,And now we are hitting those limits,on multiple fronts.,I believe that we know this,,yet we find ourselves trapped in a kind of narrative loop.,Not only do we continue to tell and retell,the same tired stories,,but we are now doing so,with a frenzy and a fury,that, frankly, verges on camp.,How else to explain the cultural space,occupied by Sarah Palin?,Now on the one hand,,exhorting us to "drill, baby, drill,",because God put those resources into the ground,in order for us to exploit them,,and on the other, glorying in the wilderness,of Alaska's untouched beauty,on her hit reality TV show.,The twin message is as comforting as it is mad.,Ignore those creeping fears,that we have finally hit the wall.,There are still no limits.,There will always be another frontier.,So stop worrying and keep shopping.,Now, would that this were just about,Sarah Palin and her reality TV show.,In environmental circles,,we often hear that, rather than shifting to renewables,,we are continuing with business as usual.,This assessment, unfortunately,,is far too optimistic.,The truth is that we have already exhausted,so much of the easily accessible fossil fuels,that we have already entered,a far riskier business era,,the era of extreme energy.,So that means drilling for oil in the deepest water,,including the icy Arctic seas,,where a clean-up may simply be impossible.,It means large-scale hydraulic fracking for gas,and massive strip-mining operations for coal,,the likes of which we haven't yet seen.,And most controversially, it means the tar sands.,I'm always surprised by how little,people outside of Canada,know about the Alberta Tar Sands,,which this year are projected to become,the number one source of imported oil,to the United States.,It's worth taking a moment to understand this practice,,because I believe it speaks to recklessness,and the path we're on,like little else.,So this is where the tar sands live,,under one of the last magnificent,Boreal forests.,The oil is not liquid.,You can't just drill a hole and pump it out.,Tar sand's oil is solid,,mixed in with the soil.,So to get at it,,you first have to get rid of the trees.,Then, you rip off the topsoil,and get at that oily sand.,The process requires a huge amount of water,,which is then pumped into massive toxic tailing ponds.,That's very bad news for local indigenous people,living downstream,who are reporting alarmingly high cancer rates.,Now looking at these images,,it's difficult to grasp the scale of this operation,,which can already be seen from space,and could grow to an area the size of England.,I find it helps actually,to look at the dump trucks that move the earth,,the largest ever built.,That's a person down there by the wheel.,My point is that,this is not oil drilling.,It's not even mining.,It is terrestrial skinning.,Vast, vivid landscapes,are being gutted,,left monochromatic gray.,Now I should confess that as [far as] I'm concerned,this would be an abomination,if it emitted not one particle of carbon.,But the truth is that, on average,,turning that gunk into crude oil,produces about three times more greenhouse gas pollution,than it does to produce conventional oil,in Canada.,How else to describe this,,but as a form of mass insanity?,Just when we know we need to be learning,to live on the surface of our planet,,off the power of sun, wind and waves,,we are frantically digging,to get at the dirtiest,,highest-emitting stuff imaginable.,This is where our story of endless growth,has taken us,,to this black hole at the center of my country --,a place of such planetary pain,that, like the BP gusher,,one can only stand to look at it for so long.,As Jared Diamond and others have shown us,,this is how civilizations commit suicide,,by slamming their foot on the accelerator,at the exact moment,when they should be putting on the brakes.,The problem is that our master-narrative,has an answer for that too.,At the very last minute, we are going to get saved,just like in every Hollywood movie,,just like in the Rapture.,But, of course, our secular religion is technology.,Now, you may have noticed,more and more headlines like these.,The idea behind this form of "geoengineering" as it's called,,is that, as the planet heats up,,we may be able to shoot sulfates and aluminum particles,into the stratosphere,to reflect some of the sun's rays,back to space,,thereby cooling the planet.,The wackiest plan -- and I'm not making this up --,would put what is essentially a garden hose,18-and-a-half miles high into the sky,,suspended by balloons,,to spew sulfur dioxide.,So, solving the problem of pollution with more pollution.,Think of it as the ultimate junk shot.,The serious scientists involved in this research,all stress that these techniques,are entirely untested.,They don't know if they'll work,,and they have no idea,what kind of terrifying side effects they could unleash.,Nevertheless, the mere mention of geoengineering,is being greeted in some circles,,particularly media circles,,with a relief tinged with euphoria.,An escape hatch has been reached.,A new frontier has been found.,Most importantly,,we don't have to change our lifestyles after all.,You see, for some people,,their savior is a guy in a flowing robe.,For other people, it's a guy with a garden hose.,We badly need some new stories.,We need stories that have different kinds of heroes,willing to take different kinds of risks --,risks that confront recklessness head on,,that put the precautionary principle into practice,,even if that means through direct action --,like hundreds of young people willing to get arrested,,blocking dirty power plants,or fighting mountaintop-removal coal mining.,We need stories,that replace that linear narrative of endless growth,with circular narratives,that remind us,that what goes around comes around.,That this is our only home.,There is no escape hatch.,Call it karma, call it physics,,action and reaction, call it precaution --,the principle that reminds us,that life is too precious to be risked,for any profit.,Thank you.,(Applause)Alisa Volkman: So this is where our story begins --,the dramatic moments of the birth,of our first son, Declan.,Obviously a really profound moment,,and it changed our lives in many ways.,It also changed our lives in many unexpected ways,,and those unexpected ways we later reflected on,,that eventually spawned a business idea between the two of us,,and a year later, we launched Babble,,a website for parents. 
 Rufus Griscom: Now I think of our story,as starting a few years earlier. AV: That's true. 
 RG: You may remember, we fell head over heels in love. 
 AV: We did. 
 RG: We were at the time running a very different kind of website.,It was a website called Nerve.com,,the tagline of which was "literate smut.",It was in theory, and hopefully in practice,,a smart online magazine,about sex and culture. 
 AV: That spawned a dating site.,But you can understand the jokes that we get. Sex begets babies.,You follow instructions on Nerve and you should end up on Babble,,which we did.,And we might launch a geriatric site as our third. We'll see. 
 RG: But for us, the continuity between Nerve and Babble,was not just the life stage thing,,which is, of course, relevant,,but it was really more about,our desire to speak very honestly,about subjects that people have difficulty speaking honestly about.,It seems to us that,when people start dissembling, people start lying about things,,that's when it gets really interesting.,That's a subject that we want to dive into.,And we've been surprised to find, as young parents,,that there are almost more taboos around parenting,than there are around sex. 
 AV: It's true. So like we said,,the early years were really wonderful,,but they were also really difficult.,And we feel like some of that difficulty,was because of this false advertisement around parenting.,(Laughter),We subscribed to a lot of magazines, did our homework,,but really everywhere you look around, we were surrounded by images like this.,And we went into parenting,expecting our lives to look like this.,The sun was always streaming in, and our children would never be crying.,I would always be perfectly coiffed and well rested,,and in fact, it was not like that at all. 
 RG: When we lowered the glossy parenting magazine,that we were looking at, with these beautiful images,,and looked at the scene in our actual living room,,it looked a little bit more like this.,These are our three sons.,And of course, they're not always crying and screaming,,but with three boys, there's a decent probability,that at least one of them will not be comporting himself,exactly as he should. 
 AV: Yes, you can see where the disconnect was happening for us.,We really felt like what we went in expecting,had nothing to do with what we were actually experiencing,,and so we decided we really wanted to give it to parents straight.,We really wanted to let them understand,what the realities of parenting were in an honest way. 
 RG: So today, what we would love to do,is share with you four parenting taboos.,And of course, there are many more than four things,you can't say about parenting,,but we would like to share with you today,four that are particularly relevant for us personally.,So the first, taboo number one:,you can't say you didn't fall in love with your baby,in the very first minute.,I remember vividly, sitting there in the hospital.,We were in the process of giving birth to our first child. 
 AV: We, or I? 
 RG: I'm sorry.,Misuse of the pronoun.,Alisa was very generously in the process,of giving birth to our first child -- (AV: Thank you.),-- and I was there with a catcher's mitt.,And I was there with my arms open.,The nurse was coming at me,with this beautiful, beautiful child,,and I remember, as she was approaching me,,the voices of friends saying,,"The moment they put the baby in your hands,,you will feel a sense of love that will come over you,that is [on] an order of magnitude more powerful,than anything you've ever experienced in your entire life.",So I was bracing myself for the moment.,The baby was coming,,and I was ready for this Mack truck of love,to just knock me off my feet.,And instead, when the baby was placed in my hands,,it was an extraordinary moment.,This picture is from literally a few seconds after,the baby was placed in my hands and I brought him over.,And you can see, our eyes were glistening.,I was overwhelmed with love and affection for my wife,,with deep, deep gratitude,that we had what appeared to be a healthy child.,And it was also, of course, surreal.,I mean, I had to check the tags and make sure.,I was incredulous, "Are you sure this is our child?",And this was all quite remarkable.,But what I felt towards the child at that moment was deep affection,,but nothing like what I feel for him now, five years later. 
 And so we've done something here,that is heretical.,We have charted,our love for our child over time.,(Laughter),This, as you know, is an act of heresy.,You're not allowed to chart love.,The reason you're not allowed to chart love,is because we think of love as a binary thing.,You're either in love, or you're not in love.,You love, or you don't love.,And I think the reality is that love is a process,,and I think the problem with thinking of love,as something that's binary,is that it causes us,to be unduly concerned,that love is fraudulent, or inadequate, or what have you.,And I think I'm speaking obviously here to the father's experience.,But I think a lot of men do go through this sense,in the early months, maybe their first year,,that their emotional response is inadequate in some fashion. 
 AV: Well, I'm glad Rufus is bringing this up,,because you can notice where he dips in the first years,where I think I was doing most of the work.,But we like to joke,,in the first few months of all of our children's lives,,this is Uncle Rufus.,(Laughter) 
 RG: I'm a very affectionate uncle, very affectionate uncle. 
 AV: Yes, and I often joke with Rufus when he comes home,that I'm not sure he would actually be able to find our child in a line-up,amongst other babies.,So I actually threw a pop quiz here onto Rufus. 
 RG: Uh oh. 
 AV: I don't want to embarrass him too much. But I am going to give him three seconds. 
 RG: That is not fair. This is a trick question. He's not up there, is he? 
 AV: Our eight-week-old son is somewhere in here,,and I want to see if Rufus can actually quickly identify him. 
 RG: The far left. AV: No! 
 (Laughter) 
 RG: Cruel. 
 AV: Nothing more to be said. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'll move on to taboo number two.,You can't talk about how lonely having a baby can be.,I enjoyed being pregnant. I loved it.,I felt incredibly connected to the community around me.,I felt like everyone was participating in my pregnancy, all around me,,tracking it down till the actual due-date.,I felt like I was a vessel of the future of humanity.,That continued into the the hospital. It was really exhilarating.,I was shower with gifts and flowers and visitors.,It was a really wonderful experience,,but when I got home,,I suddenly felt very disconnected,and suddenly shut in and shut out,,and I was really surprised by those feelings.,I did expect it to be difficult,,have sleepless nights, constant feedings,,but I did not expect the feelings,of isolation and loneliness that I experienced,,and I was really surprised that no one had talked to me,,that I was going to be feeling this way.,And I called my sister,whom I'm very close to -- and had three children --,and I asked her, "Why didn't you tell me,I was going to be feeling this way,,that I was going to have these -- feeling incredibly isolated?",And she said -- I'll never forget --,"It's just not something you want to say to a mother,that's having a baby for the first time." 
 RG: And of course, we think,it's precisely what you really should be saying,to mothers who have kids for the first time.,And that this, of course, one of the themes for us,is that we think,that candor and brutal honesty,is critical to us collectively,being great parents.,And it's hard not to think,that part of what leads to this sense of isolation,is our modern world.,So Alisa's experience is not isolated.,So your 58 percent of mothers surveyed,report feelings of loneliness.,Of those, 67 percent are most lonely,when their kids are zero to five -- probably really zero to two.,In the process of preparing this,,we looked at how some other cultures around the world,deal with this period of time,,because here in the Western world,,less than 50 percent of us live near our family members,,which I think is part of why this is such a tough period.,So to take one example among many:,in Southern India,there's a practice known as jholabhari,,in which the pregnant woman, when she's seven or eight months pregnant,,moves in with her mother,and goes through a series of rituals and ceremonies,,give birth and returns home to her nuclear family,several months after the child is born.,And this is one of many ways,that we think other cultures offset this kind of lonely period. 
 AV: So taboo number three:,you can't talk about your miscarriage -- but today I'll talk about mine.,So after we had Declan,,we kind of recalibrated our expectations.,We thought we actually could go through this again,and thought we knew what we would be up against.,And we were grateful that I was able to get pregnant,,and I soon learned that we were having a boy,,and then when I was five months,,we learned that we had lost our child.,This is actually the last little image we have of him.,And it was obviously a very difficult time --,really painful.,As I was working through that mourning process,,I was amazed that I didn't want to see anybody.,I really wanted to crawl into a hole,,and I didn't really know how I was going,to work my way back into my surrounding community.,And I realize, I think, the way I was feeling that way,,is on a really deep gut level,,I was feeling a lot of shame,and embarrassed, frankly,,that, in some respects, I had failed,at delivering what I'm genetically engineered to do.,And of course, it made me question,,if I wasn't able to have another child,,what would that mean for my marriage,,and just me as a woman.,So it was a very difficult time.,As I started working through it more,,I started climbing out of that hole and talking with other people.,I was really amazed,by all the stories that started flooding in.,People I interacted with daily,,worked with, was friends with,,family members that I had known a long time,,had never shared with me their own stories.,And I just remember feeling all these stories came out of the woodwork,,and I felt like I happened upon,this secret society of women that I now was a part of,,which was reassuring and also really concerning.,And I think,,miscarriage is an invisible loss.,There's not really a lot of community support around it.,There's really no ceremony,,rituals, or rites.,And I think, with a death, you have a funeral, you celebrate the life,,and there's a lot of community support,,and it's something women don't have with miscarriage. 
 RG: Which is too bad because, of course,,it's a very common and very traumatic experience.,Fifteen to 20 percent of all pregnancies result in miscarriage,,and I find this astounding.,In a survey, 74 percent of women said,that miscarriage, they felt, was partly their fault, which is awful.,And astoundingly, 22 percent,said they would hide a miscarriage from their spouse. 
 So taboo number four:,you can't say that your average happiness,has declined since having a child.,The party line is that every single aspect of my life,has just gotten dramatically better,ever since I participated,in the miracle that is childbirth and family.,I'll never forget, I remember vividly to this day,,our first son, Declan, was nine months old,,and I was sitting there on the couch,,and I was reading Daniel Gilbert's wonderful book, "Stumbling on Happiness.",And I got about two-thirds of the way through,,and there was a chart on the right-hand side --,on the right-hand page --,that we've labeled here,"The Most Terrifying Chart Imaginable,for a New Parent.",This chart is comprised of four completely independent studies.,Basically, there's this precipitous drop,of marital satisfaction,,which is closely aligned, we all know, with broader happiness,,that doesn't rise again,until your first child goes to college.,So I'm sitting here looking at the next two decades of my life,,this chasm of happiness,that we're driving our proverbial convertible straight into.,We were despondent. 
 AV: So you can imagine, I mean again, the first few months were difficult,,but we'd come out of it,,and were really shocked to see this study.,So we really wanted to take a deeper look at it,in hopes that we would find a silver lining. 
 RG: And that's when it's great to be running a website for parents,,because we got this incredible reporter,to go and interview all the scientists,who conducted these four studies.,We said, something is wrong here.,There's something missing from these studies.,It can't possibly be that bad.,So Liz Mitchell did a wonderful job with this piece,,and she interviewed four scientists,,and she also interviewed Daniel Gilbert,,and we did indeed find a silver lining.,So this is our guess,as to what this baseline of average happiness,arguably looks like throughout life.,Average happiness is, of course, inadequate,,because it doesn't speak,to the moment-by-moment experience,,and so this is what we think it looks like,when you layer in,moment-to-moment experience.,And so we all remember as children,,the tiniest little thing -- and we see it on the faces of our children --,the teeniest little thing,can just rocket them to these heights,of just utter adulation,,and then the next teeniest little thing,can cause them just to plummet to the depths of despair.,And it's just extraordinary to watch, and we remember it ourselves.,And then, of course, as you get older,,it's almost like age is a form of lithium. 
 As you get older, you become more stable.,And part of what happens, I think, in your '20s and '30s,,is you start to learn to hedge your happiness.,You start to realize that,"Hey, I could go to this live music event,and have an utterly transforming experience,that will cover my entire body with goosebumps,,but it's more likely that I'll feel claustrophobic,and I won't be able to get a beer.,So I'm not going to go.,I've got a good stereo at home. So, I'm not going to go.",So your average happiness goes up,,but you lose those transcendent moments. 
 AV: Yeah, and then you have your first child,,and then you really resubmit yourself,to these highs and lows --,the highs being the first steps, the first smile,,your child reading to you for the first time --,the lows being, our house, any time from six to seven every night.,But you realize you resubmit yourself,to losing control in a really wonderful way,,which we think provides a lot of meaning to our lives,and is quite gratifying. 
 RG: And so in effect,,we trade average happiness.,We trade the sort of security and safety,of a certain level of contentment,for these transcendent moments.,So where does that leave the two of us,as a family with our three little boys,in the thick of all this?,There's another factor in our case.,We have violated yet another taboo,in our own lives,,and this is a bonus taboo. 
 AV: A quick bonus taboo for you, that we should not be working together,,especially with three children --,and we are. 
 RG: And we had reservations about this on the front end.,Everybody knows, you should absolutely not work with your spouse.,In fact, when we first went out to raise money to start Babble,,the venture capitalists said,,"We categorically don't invest,in companies founded by husbands and wives,,because there's an extra point of failure.,It's a bad idea. Don't do it.",And we obviously went forward. We did.,We raised the money, and we're thrilled that we did,,because in this phase of one's life,,the incredibly scarce resource is time.,And if you're really passionate about what you do every day -- which we are --,and you're also passionate about your relationship,,this is the only way we know how to do it.,And so the final question that we would ask is:,can we collectively bend that happiness chart upwards?,It's great that we have these transcendent moments of joy,,but they're sometimes pretty quick.,And so how about that average baseline of happiness?,Can we move that up a little bit? 
 AV: And we kind of feel that the happiness gap, which we talked about,,is really the result of walking into parenting --,and really any long-term partnership for that matter --,with the wrong expectations.,And if you have the right expectations and expectation management,,we feel like it's going to be a pretty gratifying experience. 
 RG: And so this is what --,And we think that a lot of parents,,when you get in there -- in our case anyway --,you pack your bags for a trip to Europe, and you're really excited to go.,Get out of the airplane,,it turns out you're trekking in Nepal.,And trekking in Nepal is an extraordinary experience,,particularly if you pack your bags properly,and you know what you're getting in for and you're psyched.,So the point of all this for us today,is not just hopefully honesty for the sake of honesty,,but a hope that by being more honest and candid about these experiences,,that we can all collectively,bend that happiness baseline up a little bit. 
 RG + AV: Thank you. 
 (Applause)So for any of us in this room today,nlet's start out by admitting we're lucky.,We don't live in the worldnour mothers lived in,,our grandmothers lived in,,where career choicesnfor women were so limited.,And if you're in this room today,,most of us grew up in a worldnwhere we have basic civil rights,,and amazingly, we still live in a worldnwhere some women don't have them.,But all that aside,nwe still have a problem,,and it's a real problem.,And the problem is this:,Women are not making itnto the top of any profession,anywhere in the world.,The numbers tell the story quite clearly.,190 heads of state --nnine are women.,Of all the peoplenin parliament in the world,,13 percent are women.,In the corporate sector, women at the top,,C-level jobs, board seats --,tops out at 15, 16 percent.,The numbers have not moved since 2002,and are going in the wrong direction.,And even in the non-profit world,,a world we sometimes think ofnas being led by more women,,women at the top: 20 percent. 
 We also have another problem,,which is that women face harder choices,between professional successnand personal fulfillment.,A recent study in the U.S.nshowed that, of married senior managers,,two-thirds of the married men had children,and only one-thirdnof the married women had children.,A couple of years ago, I was in New York,,and I was pitching a deal,,and I was in one of those fancynNew York private equity offices,you can picture.,And I'm in the meeting --nit's about a three-hour meeting --,and two hours in,nthere needs to be that bio break,,and everyone stands up,,and the partner running the meetingnstarts looking really embarrassed.,And I realized he doesn't knownwhere the women's room is in his office.,So I start lookingnaround for moving boxes,,figuring they just moved in,nbut I don't see any.,And so I said, "Did you justnmove into this office?",And he said, "No,nwe've been here about a year.",And I said, "Are you telling menthat I am the only woman,to have pitched a dealnin this office in a year?",And he looked at me, and he said,,"Yeah. Or maybe you're the only onenwho had to go to the bathroom." 
 (Laughter) 
 So the question is,nhow are we going to fix this?,How do we change these numbers at the top?,How do we make this different?,I want to start out by saying,nI talk about this --,about keeping women in the workforce --,because I really think that's the answer.,In the high-income part of our workforce,,in the people who end up at the top --,Fortune 500 CEO jobs,nor the equivalent in other industries --,the problem, I am convinced,nis that women are dropping out.,Now people talk about this a lot,,and they talk about thingsnlike flextime and mentoring,and programs companiesnshould have to train women.,I want to talk about none of that today,,even though that's all really important.,Today I want to focusnon what we can do as individuals.,What are the messagesnwe need to tell ourselves?,What are the messages we tellnthe women that work with and for us?,What are the messagesnwe tell our daughters? 
 Now, at the outset,nI want to be very clear,that this speech comes with no judgments.,I don't have the right answer.,I don't even have it for myself.,I left San Francisco,nwhere I live, on Monday,,and I was getting on the planenfor this conference.,And my daughter, who's three,nwhen I dropped her off at preschool,,did that whole hugging-the-leg, crying,n"Mommy, don't get on the plane" thing.,This is hard. I feel guilty sometimes.,I know no women,,whether they're at homenor whether they're in the workforce,,who don't feel that sometimes.,So I'm not sayingnthat staying in the workforce,is the right thing for everyone. 
 My talk today is aboutnwhat the messages are,if you do want to stay in the workforce,,and I think there are three.,One, sit at the table.,Two, make your partner a real partner.,And three, don't leave before you leave.,Number one: sit at the table.,Just a couple weeks ago at Facebook,,we hosted a very seniorngovernment official,,and he came in to meet with senior execs,from around Silicon Valley.,And everyone kind of sat at the table.,He had these two womennwho were traveling with him,pretty senior in his department,,and I kind of said to them,,"Sit at the table.nCome on, sit at the table,",and they sat on the side of the room.,When I was in college, my senior year,,I took a course callednEuropean Intellectual History.,Don't you love that kindnof thing from college?,I wish I could do that now.,And I took it with my roommate, Carrie,,who was then a brilliantnliterary student --,and went on to be a brilliantnliterary scholar --,and my brother -- smart guy,,but a water-polo-playing pre-med,,who was a sophomore. 
 The three of us take this class together.,And then Carrie reads all the booksnin the original Greek and Latin,,goes to all the lectures.,I read all the books in English,and go to most of the lectures.,My brother is kind of busy.,He reads one book of 12nand goes to a couple of lectures,,marches himself up to our room,a couple days before the examnto get himself tutored.,The three of us go to the examntogether, and we sit down.,And we sit there for three hours --,and our little blue notebooksn-- yes, I'm that old.,We walk out, we look at each other,nand we say, "How did you do?",And Carrie says, "Boy, I feel likenI didn't really draw out the main point,on the Hegelian dialectic.",And I say, "God, I reallynwish I had really connected,John Locke's theory of propertynwith the philosophers that follow.",And my brother says,,"I got the top grade in the class." 
 (Laughter) 
 "You got the top grade in the class?,You don't know anything." 
 (Laughter) 
 The problem with these storiesnis that they show what the data shows:,women systematicallynunderestimate their own abilities.,If you test men and women,,and you ask them questionsnon totally objective criteria like GPAs,,men get it wrong slightly high,,and women get it wrong slightly low.,Women do not negotiatenfor themselves in the workforce.,A study in the last two years,of people enteringnthe workforce out of college,showed that 57 percentnof boys entering, or men, I guess,,are negotiating their first salary,,and only seven percent of women.,And most importantly,,men attribute their success to themselves,,and women attribute itnto other external factors.,If you ask men why they did a good job,,they'll say, "I'm awesome.,Obviously. Why are you even asking?",If you ask women why they did a good job,,what they'll say is someone helped them,,they got lucky, they worked really hard.,Why does this matter?,Boy, it matters a lot.,Because no one gets to the corner office,by sitting on the side, not at the table,,and no one gets the promotion,if they don't thinknthey deserve their success,,or they don't even understandntheir own success. 
 I wish the answer were easy.,I wish I could go tellnall the young women I work for,,these fabulous women,,"Believe in yourselfnand negotiate for yourself.,Own your own success.",I wish I could tell that to my daughter.,But it's not that simple.,Because what the data shows,nabove all else, is one thing,,which is that success and likeabilitynare positively correlated for men,and negatively correlated for women.,And everyone's nodding,nbecause we all know this to be true. 
 There's a really good studynthat shows this really well.,There's a famous HarvardnBusiness School study,on a woman named Heidi Roizen.,And she's an operatornin a company in Silicon Valley,,and she uses her contacts,to become a very successfulnventure capitalist.,In 2002 -- not so long ago --,a professor who was thennat Columbia University,took that casenand made it [Howard] Roizen.,And he gave the case out, both of them,nto two groups of students.,He changed exactly one word:,"Heidi" to "Howard.",But that one word madena really big difference.,He then surveyed the students,,and the good news was the students,nboth men and women,,thought Heidi and Howardnwere equally competent,,and that's good.,The bad news wasnthat everyone liked Howard.,He's a great guy.nYou want to work for him.,You want to spend the daynfishing with him.,But Heidi? Not so sure.,She's a little out for herself.nShe's a little political.,You're not surenyou'd want to work for her.,This is the complication.,We have to tell our daughtersnand our colleagues,,we have to tell ourselvesnto believe we got the A,,to reach for the promotion,nto sit at the table,,and we have to do it in a world,where, for them, there are sacrificesnthey will make for that,,even though for their brothers,nthere are not. 
 The saddest thing about all of thisnis that it's really hard to remember this.,And I'm about to tell a storynwhich is truly embarrassing for me,,but I think important.,I gave this talk at Facebooknnot so long ago,to about 100 employees,,and a couple hours later,nthere was a young woman who works there,sitting outside my little desk,nand she wanted to talk to me.,I said, okay, and she sat down,nand we talked.,And she said, "I learned something today.,I learned that I need to keep my hand up.","What do you mean?",She said, "You're giving this talk,,and you said you would takentwo more questions.,I had my hand up with many other people,,and you took two more questions.,I put my hand down, and I noticednall the women did the same,,and then you took more questions,,only from the men.",And I thought to myself,,"Wow, if it's me -- who caresnabout this, obviously --,giving this talk --,and during this talk, I can't even noticenthat the men's hands are still raised,,and the women's hands are still raised,,how good are we,as managers of our companiesnand our organizations,at seeing that the mennare reaching for opportunities,more than women?",We've got to get womennto sit at the table. 
 (Cheers) 
 (Applause) 
 Message number two:,Make your partner a real partner.,I've become convinced that we've madenmore progress in the workforce,than we have in the home.,The data shows this very clearly.,If a woman and a mannwork full-time and have a child,,the woman does twice the amountnof housework the man does,,and the woman does three timesnthe amount of childcare the man does.,So she's got three jobsnor two jobs, and he's got one.,Who do you think drops outnwhen someone needs to be home more?,The causes of this are really complicated,nand I don't have time to go into them.,And I don't think Sunday football-watchingnand general laziness is the cause. 
 I think the cause is more complicated.,I think, as a society,,we put more pressurenon our boys to succeed,than we do on our girls.,I know men that stay home,and work in the homento support wives with careers,,and it's hard.,When I go to the Mommy-and-Me stuffnand I see the father there,,I notice that the other mommiesndon't play with him.,And that's a problem,,because we have to make itnas important a job,,because it's the hardest jobnin the world to work inside the home,,for people of both genders,,if we're going to even things out and letnwomen stay in the workforce. 
 (Applause) 
 Studies show that householdsnwith equal earning,and equal responsibility,also have half the divorce rate.,And if that wasn't good enough motivationnfor everyone out there,,they also have more --,how shall I say this on this stage?,They know each other morenin the biblical sense as well. 
 (Cheers) 
 Message number three:,Don't leave before you leave.,I think there's a really deep irony,to the fact that actionsnwomen are taking --,and I see this all the time --,with the objectivenof staying in the workforce,actually lead to their eventually leaving.,Here's what happens:,We're all busy. Everyone's busy.nA woman's busy.,And she starts thinkingnabout having a child,,and from the moment she startsnthinking about having a child,,she starts thinkingnabout making room for that child.,"How am I going to fit thisninto everything else I'm doing?",And literally from that moment,,she doesn't raise her hand anymore,,she doesn't look for a promotion,nshe doesn't take on the new project,,she doesn't say, "Me. I want to do that.",She starts leaning back.,The problem is that --,let's say she got pregnantnthat day, that day --,nine months of pregnancy,nthree months of maternity leave,,six months to catch your breath --,Fast-forward two years,,more often -- and as I've seen it --,women start thinkingnabout this way earlier --,when they get engaged, or married,,when they start thinkingnabout having a child,,which can take a long time.,One woman came to see me about this.,She looked a little young.,And I said, "So are you and your husbandnthinking about having a baby?",And she said, "Oh no, I'm not married.",She didn't even have a boyfriend. 
 (Laughter) 
 I said, "You're thinking about thisnjust way too early." 
 But the point is that what happens,once you startnkind of quietly leaning back?,Everyone who's been through this --,and I'm here to tell you,nonce you have a child at home,,your job better be really good to go back,,because it's hard to leaventhat kid at home.,Your job needs to be challenging.,It needs to be rewarding.,You need to feel like you'renmaking a difference.,And if two years agonyou didn't take a promotion,and some guy next to you did,,if three years ago you stoppednlooking for new opportunities,,you're going to be bored,because you should have keptnyour foot on the gas pedal.,Don't leave before you leave.,Stay in.,Keep your foot on the gas pedal,,until the very day you need to leavento take a break for a child --,and then make your decisions.,Don't make decisions too far in advance,,particularly ones you're notneven conscious you're making. 
 My generation really, sadly,,is not going to changenthe numbers at the top.,They're just not moving.,We are not going to getnto where 50 percent of the population --,in my generation, there will notnbe 50 percent of [women],at the top of any industry.,But I'm hopeful that futurengenerations can.,I think a world where halfnof our countries and our companies,were run by women,nwould be a better world.,It's not just because people would knownwhere the women's bathrooms are,,even though that would be very helpful.,I think it would be a better world.,I have two children.,I have a five-year-old sonnand a two-year-old daughter.,I want my son to have a choice,to contribute fullynin the workforce or at home,,and I want my daughternto have the choice to not just succeed,,but to be liked for her accomplishments. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)"What I Will" 
 I will not dance to your war drum.,I will not lend my soul nor my bones to your war drum.,I will not dance to that beating.,I know that beat.,It is lifeless.,I know intimately that skin you are hitting.,It was alive once,,hunted, stolen,,stretched.,I will not dance to your drummed-up war.,I will not pop, spin, break for you.,I will not hate for you,or even hate you.,I will not kill for you.,Especially I will not die for you.,I will not mourn the dead with murder nor suicide.,I will not side with you or dance to bombs,because everyone is dancing.,Everyone can be wrong.,Life is a right, not collateral or casual.,I will not forget where I come from.,I will craft my own drum.,Gather my beloved near,,and our chanting will be dancing.,Our humming will be drumming.,I will not be played.,I will not lend my name nor my rhythm to your beat.,I will dance and resist and dance and persist and dance.,This heartbeat is louder than death.,Your war drum ain't louder,than this breath. Haaa. 
 What's up TED people? Let me hear you make some noise. 
 (Applause) 
 A bunch of pacifists.,Confused, aspiring pacifists.,I understand. 
 I've been wrong a lot lately.,Like a lot.,So I couldn't figure out,what to read today.,I mean, I've been saying I've been prepping.,What that means is prepping my outfit,,(Laughter),prepping options,,trying to figure out what I'm coming behind,and going in front of.,Poetry does that.,It preps you. It aims you. 
 So I am going to read a poem,that was chosen just now.,But I'm going to need you,to just sit for like 10 minutes,and hold a woman who is not here.,Hold her now,with you.,You don't need to say her name out loud, you can just hold her.,Are you holding her? 
 This is "Break Clustered." 
 All holy history banned.,Unwritten books predicted the future, projected the past.,But my head unwraps,around what appears limitless,,man's creative violence.,Whose son shall it be?,Which male child will perish a new day?,Our boys' deaths galvanize.,We cherish corpses.,We mourn women, complicated.,Bitches get beat daily.,Profits made, prophets ignored.,War and tooth, enameled salted lemon childhoods.,All colors run, none of us solid.,Don't look for shadow behind me. I carry it within.,I live cycles of light and darkness.,Rhythm is half silence.,I see now, I never was one and not the other.,Sickness, health, tender violence.,I think now I never was pure.,Before form I was storm,,blind, ign'ant -- still am.,Human contracted itself blind, malignant.,I never was pure.,Girl spoiled before ripened.,Language can't math me.,I experience exponentially.,Everything is everything.,One woman loses 15, maybe 20, members of her family.,One woman loses six.,One woman loses her head.,One woman searches rubble. One woman feeds on trash.,One woman shoots her face. One woman shoots her husband.,One woman straps herself.,One woman gives birth to a baby.,One woman gives birth to borders.,One woman no longer believes love will ever find her.,One woman never did.,Where do refugee hearts go?,Broken, dissed,,placed where they're not from, don't want to be missed.,Faced with absence.,We mourn each one,or we mean nothing at all.,My spine curves spiral.,Precipice running to and running from human beings.,Cluster bombs left behind.,De facto landmines.,A smoldering grief.,Harvest contaminated tobacco.,Harvest bombs.,Harvest baby teeth.,Harvest palms, smoke.,Harvest witness, smoke.,Resolutions, smoke.,Salvation, smoke.,Redemption, smoke.,Breathe.,Do not fear,what has blown up.,If you must,,fear the unexploded. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)My name is Arvind Gupta, and I'm a toymaker.,I've been making toys for the last 30 years.,The early '70s, I was in college.,It was a very revolutionary time.,It was a political ferment, so to say --,students out in the streets of Paris,,revolting against authority.,America was jolted,by the anti-Vietnam movement, the Civil Rights movement.,In India, we had the Naxalite movement,,the [unclear] movement.,But you know, when there is a political churning of society,,it unleashes a lot of energy.,The National Movement of India,was testimony to that.,Lots of people resigned from well-paid jobs,and jumped into the National Movement.,Now in the early '70s,,one of the great programs in India,was to revitalize,primary science in village schools. 
 There was a person, Anil Sadgopal, did a Ph.D. from Caltech,and returned back as a molecular biologist,in India's cutting-edge research institute, the TIFR.,At 31, he was not able,to relate the kind of [unclear] research,,which he was doing with the lives of the ordinary people.,So he designed and went and started a village science program.,Many people were inspired by this.,The slogan of the early '70s,was "Go to the people.,Live with them; love them.,Start from what they know. Build on what they have.",This was kind of the defining slogan. 
 Well I took one year.,I joined Telco, made TATA trucks, pretty close to Pune.,I worked there for two years,,and I realized that I was not born to make trucks.,Often one doesn't know what one wants to do,,but it's good enough to know what you don't want to do.,So I took one year off, and I went to this village science program.,And it was a turning point.,It was a very small village --,a weekly bazaar,where people, just once in a week, they put in all the vats.,So I said, "I'm going to spend a year over here.",So I just bought one specimen,of everything which was sold on the roadside.,And one thing which I found,was this black rubber. 
 This is called a cycle valve tube.,When you pump in air in a bicycle, you use a bit of this.,And some of these models --,so you take a bit of this cycle valve tube,,you can put two matchsticks inside this, and you make a flexible joint.,It's a joint of tubes. You start by teaching angles --,an acute angle, a right angle, an obtuse angle, a straight angle.,It's like its own little coupling.,If you have three of them, and you loop them together,,well you make a triangle.,With four, you make a square,,you make a pentagon, you make a hexagon,,you make all these kind of polygons.,And they have some wonderful properties.,If you look at the hexagon, for instance,,it's like an amoeba, which is constantly changing its own profile.,You can just pull this out, this becomes a rectangle.,You give it a push, this becomes a parallelogram.,But this is very shaky.,Look at the pentagon, for instance,,pull this out -- it becomes a boat shape trapezium.,Push it and it becomes house shaped.,This becomes an isosceles triangle --,again, very shaky.,This square might look very square and prim.,Give it a little push -- this becomes a rhombus.,It becomes kite-shaped.,But give a child a triangle,,he can't do a thing to it. 
 Why use triangles?,Because triangles are the only rigid structures.,We can't make a bridge with squares,because the train would come, it would start doing a jig.,Ordinary people know about this,because if you go to a village in India,,they might not have gone to engineering college,,but no one makes a roof placed like this.,Because if they put tiles on top, it's just going to crash.,They always make a triangular roof.,Now this is people science. 
 And if you were to just poke a hole over here,and put a third matchstick,,you'll get a T joint.,And if I were to poke all the three legs of this,in the three vertices of this triangle,,I would make a tetrahedron.,So you make all these 3D shapes.,You make a tetrahedron like this.,And once you make these,,you make a little house.,Put this on top.,You can make a joint of four. You can make a joint of six.,You just need a ton.,Now this was -- you make a joint of six,,you make an icosahedron.,You can play around with it.,This makes an igloo.,Now this is in 1978.,I was a 24-year-old young engineer.,And I thought this was so much better than making trucks.,(Applause),If you, as a matter of fact, put four marbles inside,,you simulate the molecular structure of methane, CH4.,Four atoms of hydrogen, the four points of the tetrahedron,,which means the little carbon atom. 
 Well since then,,I just thought that I've been really privileged,to go to over 2,000 schools in my country --,village schools, government schools,,municipal schools, Ivy League schools --,I've been invited by most of them.,And every time I go to a school,,I see a gleam in the eyes of the children.,I see hope. I see happiness in their faces.,Children want to make things. Children want to do things. 
 Now this, we make lots and lots of pumps.,Now this is a little pump,with which you could inflate a balloon.,It's a real pump. You could actually pop the balloon.,And we have a slogan,that the best thing a child can do with a toy is to break it.,So all you do is --,it's a very kind of provocative statement --,this old bicycle tube and this old plastic [unclear],This filling cap will go very snugly into an old bicycle tube.,And this is how you make a valve.,You put a little sticky tape.,This is one-way traffic.,Well we make lots and lots of pumps.,And this is the other one --,that you just take a straw, and you just put a stick inside,and you make two half-cuts.,Now this is what you do,,is you bend both these legs into a triangle,,and you just wrap some tape around.,And this is the pump.,And now, if you have this pump,,it's like a great, great sprinkler.,It's like a centrifuge.,If you spin something, it tends to fly out. 
 (Applause) 
 Well in terms of -- if you were in Andhra Pradesh,,you would make this with the palmyra leaf.,Many of our folk toys,have great science principles.,If you spin-top something, it tends to fly out.,If I do it with both hands, you can see this fun Mr. Flying Man.,Right.,This is a toy which is made from paper. It's amazing.,There are four pictures.,You see insects,,you see frogs, snakes, eagles, butterflies,,frogs, snakes, eagles.,Here's a paper which you could [unclear] --,designed by a mathematician at Harvard in 1928,,Arthur Stone,,documented by Martin Gardner in many of his many books.,But this is great fun for children.,They all study about the food chain.,The insects are eaten by the frogs; the frogs are eaten by the snakes;,the snakes are eaten by the eagles.,And this can be, if you had a whole photocopy paper --,A4 size paper --,you could be in a municipal school, you could be in a government school --,a paper, a scale and a pencil -- no glue, no scissors.,In three minutes, you just fold this up.,And what you could use it for is just limited by your imagination.,If you take a smaller paper, you make a smaller flexagon.,With a bigger one, you make a bigger one. 
 Now this is a pencil with a few slots over here.,And you put a little fan here.,And this is a hundred-year-old toy.,There have been six major research papers on this.,There's some grooves over here, you can see.,And if I take a reed -- if I rub this,,something very amazing happens.,Six major research papers on this.,As a matter of fact, Feynman, as a child, was very fascinated by this.,He wrote a paper on this.,And you don't need the three billion-dollar Hadron Collider,for doing this. (Laughter) (Applause),This is there for every child,,and every child can enjoy this.,If you want to put a colored disk,,well all these seven colors coalesce.,And this is what Newton talked about 400 years back,,that white light's made of seven colors,,just by spinning this around. 
 This is a straw.,What we've done, we've just sealed both the ends with tape,,nipped the right corner and the bottom left corner,,so there's holes in the opposite corners, there's a little hole over here.,This is a kind of a blowing straw.,I just put this inside this.,There's a hole here, and I shut this.,And this costs very little money to make --,great fun for children to do. 
 What we do,is make a very simple electric motor.,Now this is the simplest motor on Earth.,The most expensive thing is the battery inside this.,If you have a battery, it costs five cents to make it.,This is an old bicycle tube,,which gives you a broad rubber band, two safety pins.,This is a permanent magnet.,Whenever current flows through the coil, this becomes an electromagnet.,It's the interaction of both these magnets,which makes this motor spin.,We made 30,000. 
 Teachers who have been teaching science for donkey years,,they just muck up the definition and they spit it out.,When teachers make it, children make it.,You can see a gleam in their eye.,They get a thrill,of what science is all about.,And this science is not a rich man's game.,In a democratic country,,science must reach to our most oppressed,,to the most marginalized children.,This program started with 16 schools,and spread to 1,500 government schools.,Over 100,000 children learn science this way.,And we're just trying to see possibilities. 
 Look, this is the tetrapak --,awful materials from the point of view of the environment.,There are six layers -- three layers of plastic, aluminum --,which are are sealed together.,They are fused together, so you can't separate them.,Now you can just make a little network like this,and fold them and stick them together,and make an icosahedron.,So something which is trash,,which is choking all the seabirds,,you could just recycle this into a very, very joyous --,all the platonic solids can be made with things like this. 
 This is a little straw,,and what you do is you just nip two corners here,,and this becomes like a baby crocodile's mouth.,You put this in your mouth, and you blow.,(Honk),It's children's delight, a teacher's envy, as they say.,You're not able to see how the sound is produced,,because the thing which is vibrating goes inside my mouth.,I'm going to keep this outside, to blow out. I'm going to suck in air.,(Honk),So no one actually needs to muck up the production of sound,with wire vibrations.,The other is that you keep blowing at it,,keep making the sound,,and you keep cutting it.,And something very, very nice happens.,(Honk),(Applause),And when you get a very small one --,(Honk),This is what the kids teach you. You can also do this. 
 Well before I go any further,,this is something worth sharing.,This is a touching slate meant for blind children.,This is strips of Velcro, this is my drawing slate,,and this is my drawing pen,,which is basically a film box.,It's basically like a fisherman's line,,a fishing line.,And this is wool over here.,If I crank the handle, all the wool goes inside.,And what a blind child can do is to just draw this.,Wool sticks on Velcro.,There are 12 million blind children in our country --,(Applause),who live in a world of darkness.,And this has come as a great boon to them.,There's a factory out there making our children blind,,not able to provide them with food,,not able to provide them with vitamin A.,But this has come as a great boon for them.,There are no patents. Anyone can make it. 
 This is very, very simple.,You can see, this is the generator. It's a crank generator.,These are two magnets.,This is a large pulley made by sandwiching rubber between two old CDs.,Small pulley and two strong magnets.,And this fiber turns a wire attached to an LED.,If I spin this pulley, the small one's going to spin much faster.,There will be a spinning magnetic field.,Lines, of course, would be cut, the force will be generated.,And you can see, this LED is going to glow.,So this is a small crank generator. 
 Well, this is, again,,it's just a ring, a steel ring with steel nuts.,And what you can do,is just, if you give it a twirl,,well they just keep going on.,And imagine a bunch of kids,standing in a circle,and just waiting for the steel ring to be passed on.,And they'd be absolutely joyous playing with this. 
 Well in the end, what we can also do:,we use a lot of old newspapers,to make caps.,This is worthy of Sachin Tendulkar.,It's a great cricket cap. (Laughter) (Applause),When first you see Nehru and Gandhi,,this is the Nehru cap -- just half a newspaper.,We make lots of toys with newspapers,,and this is one of them.,And this is -- you can see --,this is a flapping bird.,All of our old newspapers, we cut them into little squares.,And if you have one of these birds --,children in Japan have been making this bird for many, many years.,And you can see,,this is a little fantail bird. 
 Well in the end, I'll just end with a story.,This is called "The Captain's Hat Story.",The captain was a captain of a sea-going ship.,It goes very slowly.,And there were lots of passengers on the ship,,and they were getting bored, so the captain invited them on the deck.,"Wear all your colorful clothes and sing and dance,,and I'll provide you with good food and drinks.",And the captain would wear a cap everyday,and join in the regalia.,The first day, it was a huge umbrella cap,,like a captain's cap.,That night, when the passengers would be sleeping,,he would give it one more fold,,and the second day, he would be wearing a fireman's cap --,with a little shoot just like a designer cap,,because it protects the spinal cord.,And the second night, he would take the same cap,and give it another fold.,And the third day, it would be a Shikari cap --,just like an adventurer's cap.,And the third night, he would give it two more folds --,and this is a very, very famous cap.,If you've seen any of our Bollywood films,,this is what the policeman wears,,it's called a zapalu cap.,It's been catapulted to international glory. 
 And we must not forget that he was the captain of the ship.,So that's a ship.,And now the end:,everyone was enjoying the journey very much.,They were singing and dancing.,Suddenly there was a storm and huge waves.,And all the ship can do is to dance and pitch along with the waves.,A huge wave comes and slaps the front,and knocks it down.,And another one comes and slaps the aft and knocks it down.,And there's a third one over here.,This swallows the bridge and knocks it down.,And the ship sinks,,and the captain has lost everything,,but for a life jacket. 
 Thank you so much. 
 (Applause)So I was born,on the last day,of the last year of the '70s.,I was raised on "Free to be you and me" --,(cheering),hip-hop --,not as many woohoos for hip-hop in the house.,Thank you. Thank you for hip-hop --,and Anita Hill.,(Cheering),My parents were radicals --,(Laughter),who became,,well, grown-ups.,My dad facetiously says,,"We wanted to save the world,,and instead we just got rich.",We actually just got "middle class",in Colorado Springs, Colorado,,but you get the picture.,I was raised with a very heavy sense,of unfinished legacy. 
 At this ripe old age of 30,,I've been thinking a lot about what it means to grow up,in this horrible, beautiful time,,and I've decided, for me,,it's been a real journey and paradox.,The first paradox,is that growing up is about rejecting the past,and then promptly reclaiming it.,Feminism was the water I grew up in.,When I was just a little girl,,my mom started what is now,the longest-running women's film festival in the world.,So while other kids were watching sitcoms and cartoons,,I was watching very esoteric documentaries,made by and about women.,You can see how this had an influence.,But she was not the only feminist in the house. 
 My dad actually resigned,from the male-only business club in my hometown,because he said he would never be part of an organization,that would one day welcome his son, but not his daughter.,(Applause),He's actually here today.,(Applause),The trick here,is my brother would become an experimental poet,,not a businessman,,but the intention was really good. 
 (Laughter) 
 In any case, I didn't readily claim the feminist label,,even though it was all around me,,because I associated it with my mom's women's groups,,her swishy skirts and her shoulder pads --,none of which had much cachet,in the hallways of Palmer High School,where I was trying to be cool at the time.,But I suspected there was something really important,about this whole feminism thing,,so I started covertly tiptoeing into my mom's bookshelves,and picking books off and reading them --,never, of course, admitting that I was doing so.,I didn't actually claim the feminist label,until I went to Barnard College,and I heard Amy Richards and Jennifer Baumgardner speak for the first time.,They were the co-authors of a book called "Manifesta.",So what very profound epiphany, you might ask,,was responsible for my feminist click moment?,Fishnet stockings.,Jennifer Baumgardner was wearing them.,I thought they were really hot.,I decided, okay, I can claim the feminist label.,Now I tell you this --,I tell you this at the risk of embarrassing myself,,because I think part of the work of feminism,is to admit that aesthetics, that beauty,,that fun do matter.,There are lots of very modern political movements,that have caught fire in no small part,because of cultural hipness.,Anyone heard of these two guys as an example? 
 So my feminism is very indebted to my mom's,,but it looks very different.,My mom says, "patriarchy.",I say, "intersectionality.",So race, class, gender, ability,,all of these things go into our experiences,of what it means to be a woman.,Pay equity? Yes. Absolutely a feminist issue.,But for me, so is immigration. (Applause),Thank you.,My mom says, "Protest march.",I say, "Online organizing.",I co-edit, along with a collective,of other super-smart, amazing women,,a site called Feministing.com.,We are the most widely read feminist publication ever,,and I tell you this,because I think it's really important to see,that there's a continuum. 
 Feminist blogging is basically the 21st century version,of consciousness raising.,But we also have a straightforward political impact.,Feministing has been able,to get merchandise pulled off the shelves of Walmart.,We got a misogynist administrator sending us hate-mail,fired from a Big Ten school.,And one of our biggest successes,is we get mail from teenage girls in the middle of Iowa,who say, "I Googled Jessica Simpson and stumbled on your site.,I realized feminism wasn't about man-hating and Birkenstocks.",So we're able to pull in the next generation,in a totally new way. 
 My mom says, "Gloria Steinem.",I say, "Samhita Mukhopadhyay,,Miriam Perez, Ann Friedman,,Jessica Valenti, Vanessa Valenti,,and on and on and on and on.",We don't want one hero.,We don't want one icon.,We don't want one face.,We are thousands of women and men across this country,doing online writing, community organizing,,changing institutions from the inside out --,all continuing the incredible work,that our mothers and grandmothers started.,Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Which brings me to the second paradox:,sobering up about our smallness,and maintaining faith in our greatness,all at once.,Many in my generation --,because of well-intentioned parenting and self-esteem education --,were socialized to believe,that we were special little snowflakes --,(Laughter),who were going to go out and save the world.,These are three words many of us were raised with.,We walk across graduation stages,,high on our overblown expectations,,and when we float back down to earth,,we realize we don't know what the heck it means,to actually save the world anyway.,The mainstream media often paints my generation,as apathetic,,and I think it's much more accurate,to say we are deeply overwhelmed.,And there's a lot to be overwhelmed about, to be fair --,an environmental crisis,,wealth disparity in this country,unlike we've seen since 1928,,and globally,,a totally immoral and ongoing wealth disparity.,Xenophobia's on the rise. The trafficking of women and girls.,It's enough to make you feel very overwhelmed. 
 I experienced this firsthand myself,when I graduated from Barnard College in 2002.,I was fired up; I was ready to make a difference.,I went out and I worked at a non-profit,,I went to grad school, I phone-banked,,I protested, I volunteered,,and none of it seemed to matter.,And on a particularly dark night,of December of 2004,,I sat down with my family,,and I said that I had become very disillusioned.,I admitted that I'd actually had a fantasy -- kind of a dark fantasy --,of writing a letter,about everything that was wrong with the world,and then lighting myself on fire,on the White House steps.,My mom,took a drink of her signature Sea Breeze,,her eyes really welled with tears,,and she looked right at me and she said,,"I will not stand,for your desperation.",She said, "You are smarter, more creative,and more resilient than that." 
 Which brings me to my third paradox.,Growing up is about aiming to succeed wildly,and being fulfilled by failing really well.,(Laughter),(Applause),There's a writer I've been deeply influenced by, Parker Palmer,,and he writes that many of us are often whiplashed,"between arrogant overestimation of ourselves,and a servile underestimation of ourselves.",You may have guessed by now,,I did not light myself on fire.,I did what I know to do in desperation, which is write.,I wrote the book I needed to read.,I wrote a book about eight incredible people,all over this country,doing social justice work.,I wrote about Nia Martin-Robinson,,the daughter of Detroit and two civil rights activists,,who's dedicating her life,to environmental justice.,I wrote about Emily Apt,who initially became a caseworker in the welfare system,because she decided that was the most noble thing she could do,,but quickly learned, not only did she not like it,,but she wasn't really good at it.,Instead, what she really wanted to do was make films.,So she made a film about the welfare system,and had a huge impact.,I wrote about Maricela Guzman, the daughter of Mexican immigrants,,who joined the military so she could afford college.,She was actually sexually assaulted in boot camp,and went on to co-organize a group,called the Service Women's Action Network. 
 What I learned from these people and others,was that I couldn't judge them,based on their failure to meet their very lofty goals.,Many of them are working in deeply intractable systems --,the military, congress,,the education system, etc.,But what they managed to do within those systems,was be a humanizing force.,And at the end of the day,,what could possibly be more important than that?,Cornel West says, "Of course it's a failure.,But how good a failure is it?",This isn't to say we give up our wildest, biggest dreams.,It's to say we operate on two levels.,On one,,we really go after changing these broken systems,of which we find ourselves a part.,But on the other, we root our self-esteem,in the daily acts of trying to make one person's day,more kind, more just, etc. 
 So when I was a little girl,,I had a couple of very strange habits.,One of them was,I used to lie on the kitchen floor of my childhood home,,and I would suck the thumb of my left hand,and hold my mom's cold toes with my right hand.,(Laughter),I was listening to her talk on the phone, which she did a lot.,She was talking about board meetings,,she was founding peace organizations,,she was coordinating carpools, she was consoling friends --,all these daily acts of care and creativity.,And surely, at three and four years old,,I was listening to the soothing sound of her voice,,but I think I was also getting my first lesson in activist work. 
 The activists I interviewed,had nothing in common, literally, except for one thing,,which was that they all cited their mothers,as their most looming and important,activist influences.,So often, particularly at a young age,,we look far afield,for our models of the meaningful life,,and sometimes they're in our own kitchens,,talking on the phone, making us dinner,,doing all that keeps the world going around and around.,My mom and so many women like her,have taught me that life is not about glory,,or certainty, or security even.,It's about embracing the paradox.,It's about acting in the face of overwhelm.,And it's about loving people really well.,And at the end of the day,,these things make for a lifetime,of challenge and reward. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Phyllis Rodriguez: We are here today,because of the fact,that we have what most people consider,an unusual friendship.,And it is.,And yet, it feels natural to us now. 
 I first learned,that my son had been in the World Trade Center,on the morning of September 11th, 2001.,We didn't know,if he had perished yet,until 36 hours later.,At the time,,we knew that it was political.,We were afraid of what our country was going to do,in the name of our son --,my husband, Orlando, and I and our family.,And when I saw it --,and yet, through the shock,,the terrible shock,,and the terrible explosion in our lives, literally,,we were not vengeful.,And a couple of weeks later,when Zacarias Moussaoui was indicted,on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism,,and the U.S. government called for a death penalty,for him, if convicted,,my husband and I spoke out,in opposition to that, publicly.,Through that,and through human rights groups,,we were brought together,with several other victims' families. 
 When I saw Aicha in the media,,coming over when her son was indicted,,and I thought, "What a brave woman.,Someday I want to meet that woman when I'm stronger.",I was still in deep grief;,I knew I didn't have the strength.,I knew I would find her someday,,or we would find each other.,Because, when people heard that my son was a victim,,I got immediate sympathy.,But when people learned,what her son was accused of,,she didn't get that sympathy.,But her suffering is equal to mine. 
 So we met in November 2002,,and Aicha will now tell you,how that came about. 
 (Translator) Aicha el-Wafi: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.,I am the mother of Zacarias Moussaoui.,And I asked,the Organization of Human Rights,to put me in touch with the parents of the victims.,So they introduced me,to five families.,And I saw Phyllis, and I watched her.,She was the only mother in the group.,The others were brothers, sisters.,And I saw in her eyes,that she was a mother, just like me.,I suffered a lot as a mother.,I was married when I was 14.,I lost a child when I was 15,,a second child when I was 16.,So the story with Zacarias was too much really.,And I still suffer,,because my son,is like he's buried alive.,I know she really cried for her son.,But she knows where he is.,My son, I don't know where he is.,I don't know if he's alive. I don't know if he's tortured.,I don't know what happened to him. 
 So that's why I decided to tell my story,,so that my suffering is something positive for other women.,For all the women, all the mothers that give life,,you can give back,,you can change.,It's up to us women,,because we are women,,because we love our children.,We must be hand-in-hand,and do something together.,It's not against women,,it's for us, for us women,,for our children.,I talk against violence, against terrorism.,I go to schools,to talk to young, Muslim girls,so they don't accept to be married against their will very young.,So if I can save one of the young girls,,and avoid that they get married and suffer as much as I did,,well this is something good.,This is why I'm here in front of you. 
 PR: I would like to say,that I have learned so much from Aicha,,starting with that day we had our very first meeting,with other family members --,which was a very private meeting with security,,because it was November 2002,,and, frankly, we were afraid of the super-patriotism of that time in the country --,those of us family members.,But we were all so nervous.,"Why does she want to meet us?",And then she was nervous.,"Why did we want to meet her?",What did we want from each other?,Before we knew each others' names, or anything,,we had embraced and wept.,Then we sat in a circle,with support, with help,,from people experienced in this kind of reconciliation.,And Aicha started,,and she said,,"I don't know if my son,is guilty or innocent,,but I want to tell you how sorry I am,for what happened to your families.,I know what it is to suffer,,and I feel that if there is a crime,,a person should be tried fairly and punished.",But she reached out to us in that way,,and it was, I'd like to say, it was an ice-breaker.,And what happened then is we all told our stories,,and we all connected as human beings.,By the end of the afternoon --,it was about three hours after lunch --,we'd felt as if we'd known each other forever. 
 Now what I learned from her,,is a woman, not only who could be so generous,under these present circumstances,and what it was then,,and what was being done to her son,,but the life she's had.,I never had met,someone with such a hard life,,from such a totally different culture and environment from my own.,And I feel,that we have,a special connection,,which I value very much.,And I think it's all about,being afraid of the other,,but making that step,and then realizing, "Hey, this wasn't so hard.,Who else can I meet that I don't know,,or that I'm so different from?" 
 So, Aicha,,do you have a couple of words,for conclusion?,Because our time is up. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Translator) AW: I wanted to say,that we have to try to know other people, the other.,You have to be generous,,and your hearts must be generous,,your mind must be generous.,You must be tolerant.,You have to fight against violence.,And I hope that someday we'll all live together,in peace and respecting each other.,This is what I wanted to say. 
 (Applause)I want you to imagine two couplesnin the middle of 1979,on the exact same day,nat the exact same moment,,each conceiving a baby, OK?,So two couples each conceiving one baby.,Now I don't want you to spend toonmuch time imagining the conception,,because if you do,nyou're not going to listen to me,,so just imagine that for a moment.,And in this scenario,nI want to imagine that, in one case,,the sperm is carrying a Y chromosome,,meeting that X chromosome of the egg.,And in the other case,nthe sperm is carrying an X chromosome,,meeting the X chromosome of the egg.,Both are viable; both take off.,We'll come back to these people later. 
 So I wear two hats in most of what I do.,As the one hat, I do history of anatomy.,I'm a historian by training,nand what I study in that case,is the way that peoplenhave dealt with anatomy --,meaning human bodies, animal bodies --,how they dealt with bodily fluids,nconcepts of bodies;,how have they thought about bodies.,The other hat that I've wornnin my work is as an activist,,as a patient advocate --,or, as I sometimes say,nas an impatient advocate --,for people who are patients of doctors.,In that case, what I've worked withnis people who have body types,that challenge social norms.,So some of whatnI've worked on, for example,,is people who are conjoined twins --,two people within one body.,Some of what I've worked onnis people who have dwarfism --,so people who are muchnshorter than typical.,And a lot of what I've worked onnis people who have atypical sex --,so people who don't have the standard malenor the standard female body types.,And as a general term,nwe can use the term "intersex" for this. 
 Intersex comesnin a lot of different forms.,I'll just give you a few examplesnof the types of ways you can have sex,that isn't standard for male or female.,So in one instance,,you can have somebodynwho has an XY chromosomal basis,,and that SRY gene on the Y chromosome,tells the proto-gonads,nwhich we all have in the fetal life,,to become testes.,So in the fetal life,nthose testes are pumping out testosterone.,But because this individualnlacks receptors to hear that testosterone,,the body doesn't reactnto the testosterone.,And this is a syndrome callednandrogen insensitivity syndrome.,So lots of levels of testosterone,nbut no reaction to it.,As a consequence, the body developsnmore along the female typical path.,When the child is born,nshe looks like a girl.,She is a girl, she is raised as a girl.,And it's often not until she hits pubertynand she's growing and developing breasts,,but she's not getting her period,,that somebody figuresnout something's up here.,And they do some tests and figure out,that, instead of havingnovaries inside and a uterus,,she has testes inside,nand she has a Y chromosome. 
 Now what's important to understand,is you may think of thisnperson as really being male,,but they're really not.,Females, like males,,have in our bodies somethingncalled the adrenal glands.,They're in the back of our body.,And the adrenal glands make androgens,nwhich are a masculinizing hormone.,Most females like me --nI believe myself to be a typical female --,I don't actually knownmy chromosomal make-up,,but I think I'm probably typical --,most females like menare actually androgen-sensitive.,We're making androgen,nand we're responding to androgens.,The consequence is that somebody like me,has actually had a brainnexposed to more androgens,than the woman born with testesnwho has androgen insensitivity syndrome.,So sex is really complicated --,it's not just that intersex people,are in the middlenof all the sex spectrum --,in some ways,nthey can be all over the place. 
 Another example:,a few years ago I got a callnfrom a man who was 19 years old,,who was born a boy, raised a boy,,had a girlfriend,nhad sex with his girlfriend,,had a life as a guy,,and had just found outnthat he had ovaries and a uterus inside.,What he had was an extreme form,of a condition calledncongenital adrenal hyperplasia.,He had XX chromosomes,,and in the womb, his adrenal glandsnwere in such high gear,that it created, essentially,na masculine hormonal environment.,And as a consequence,nhis genitals were masculinized,,his brain was subject to the more typicalnmasculine component of hormones.,And he was born looking like a boy --nnobody suspected anything.,And it was only when he hadnreached the age of 19,that he began to have enough medicalnproblems from menstruating internally,,that doctors figured out that, in fact,nhe was female, internally. 
 OK, so just one more quick examplenof a way you can have intersex.,Some people who have XX chromosomesndevelop what are called ovotestis,,which is when you have ovarian tissuenwith testicular tissue wrapped around it.,And we're not exactly surenwhy that happens. 
 So sex can comenin lots of different varieties.,The reason that childrennwith these kinds of bodies --,whether it's dwarfism,nor it's conjoined twinning,,or it's an intersex type --,are often "normalized" by surgeons,is not because it actually leaves themnbetter off in terms of physical health.,In many cases, people are actuallynperfectly healthy.,The reason they're often subjectnto various kinds of surgeries,is because they threatennour social categories.,Our system has been basedntypically on the idea,that a particular kind of anatomyncomes with a particular identity.,So we have the conceptnthat what it means to be a woman,is to have a female identity;,what it means to be a black personnis, allegedly, to have an African anatomy,in terms of your history.,And so we haventhis terribly simplistic idea.,And when we're faced with a body,that actually presents usnsomething quite different,,it startles us in termsnof those categorizations. 
 So we have a lot of very romantic ideasnin our culture about individualism.,And our nation's really founded onna very romantic concept of individualism.,You can imagine how startling then it is,when you have children who are bornnwho are two people inside of one body.,Where I ran into the most heatnfrom this most recently,was last year when South African runner,nCaster Semenya,,had her sex called into questionnat the International Games in Berlin.,I had a lot of journalistsncalling me, asking me,,"Which is the test they're going to run,that will tell us whether or notnCaster Semenya is male or female?",And I had to explain to the journalistsnthere isn't such a test. 
 In fact, we now knownthat sex is complicated enough,that we have to admit:,Nature doesn't draw the linenfor us between male and female,,or between male and intersexnand female and intersex;,we actually draw that line on nature.,So what we have is a sort of situationnwhere the farther our science goes,,the more we have to admit to ourselvesnthat these categories,that we thought of as stablenanatomical categories,,that mapped very simplynto stable identity categories,are a lot more fuzzy than we thought.,And it's not just in terms of sex.,It's also in terms of race,,which turns out to benvastly more complicated,than our terminology has allowed. 
 As we look, we get into all sortsnof uncomfortable areas.,We look, for example, about the fact,that we share at least 95 percentnof our DNA with chimpanzees.,What are we to make of the fact,that we differ from themnonly, really, by a few nucleotides?,And as we get farthernand farther with our science,,we get more and moreninto a discomforted zone,,where we have to acknowledgenthat the simplistic categories we've had,are probably overly simplistic. 
 So we're seeing thisnin all sorts of places in human life.,One of the placesnwe're seeing it, for example,,in our culture,nin the United States today,,is battles over the beginningnof life and the end of life.,We have difficult conversations,about at what point we decidena body becomes a human,,such that it has a differentnright than a fetal life.,We have very difficultnconversations nowadays --,probably not out in the opennas much as within medicine --,about the questionnof when somebody's dead.,In the past, our ancestorsnnever had to struggle so much,with this questionnof when somebody was dead.,At most, they'd stickna feather on somebody's nose,,and if it twitched,nthey didn't bury them yet.,If it stopped twitching, you bury them.,But today, we have a situation,where we want to takenvital organs out of beings,and give them to other beings.,And as a consequence,,we have to strugglenwith this really difficult question,about who's dead,,and this leads usnto a really difficult situation,where we don't have such simplencategories as we've had before. 
 Now you might think that all thisnbreaking-down of categories,would make somebody like me really happy.,I'm a political progressive,nI defend people with unusual bodies,,but I have to admit to younthat it makes me nervous.,Understanding that these categories,are really much more unstablenthan we thought makes me tense.,It makes me tense from the point of viewnof thinking about democracy.,So in order to tell younabout that tension,,I have to first admit to youna huge fan of the Founding Fathers.,I know they were racists,nI know they were sexist,,but they were great.,I mean, they were so brave and so boldnand so radical in what they did,,that I find myself watching that cheesynmusical "1776" every few years,,and it's not because of the music,nwhich is totally forgettable.,It's because of what happened in 1776nwith the Founding Fathers. 
 The Founding Fathers were,nfor my point of view,,the original anatomical activists,,and this is why.,What they rejectednwas an anatomical concept,and replaced it with another one,that was radical and beautifulnand held us for 200 years.,So as you all recall,,what our Founding Fathers werenrejecting was a concept of monarchy,,and the monarchy was basically basednon a very simplistic concept of anatomy.,The monarchs of the old worldndidn't have a concept of DNA,,but they did have a concept of birthright.,They had a concept of blue blood.,They had the idea that the peoplenwho would be in political power,should be in political powernbecause of the blood being passed down,from grandfather to fathernto son and so forth.,The Founding Fathers rejected that idea,,and they replaced itnwith a new anatomical concept,,and that conceptnwas "all men are created equal.",They leveled that playing fieldnand decided the anatomy that mattered,was the commonality of anatomy,nnot the difference in anatomy,,and that was a really radical thing to do. 
 Now they were doing it in part,because they were partnof an Enlightenment system,where two things were growing up together.,And that was democracy growing up,,but it was also sciencengrowing up at the same time.,And it's really clear, if you looknat the history of the Founding Fathers,,a lot of them were veryninterested in science,,and they were interestednin the concept of a naturalistic world.,They were moving awaynfrom supernatural explanations,,and they were rejecting thingsnlike a supernatural concept of power,,where it transmitted becausenof a very vague concept of birthright. 
 They were movingntowards a naturalistic concept.,And if you look, for example,nin the Declaration of Independence,,they talk about nature and nature's God.,They don't talk about Godnand God's nature.,They're talking about the power of naturento tell us who we are.,So as part of that,nthey were coming to us with a concept,that was about anatomical commonality.,And in doing so, they were reallynsetting up in a beautiful way,the Civil Rights Movement of the future.,They didn't think of it that way,nbut they did it for us, and it was great. 
 So what happened years afterwards?,What happened was women, for example,nwho wanted the right to vote,,took the Founding Fathers' conceptnof anatomical commonality,being more importantnthan anatomical difference,and said, "The fact that we havena uterus and ovaries,is not significant enoughnin terms of a difference,to mean that we shouldn'tnhave the right to vote,,the right to full citizenship,nthe right to own property, etc.",And women successfully argued that.,Next came the successfulnCivil Rights Movement,,where we found people like Sojourner Truth,talking about, "Ain't I a woman?",We find men on the marching linesnof the Civil Rights Movement,saying, "I am a man.",Again, people of colornappealing to a commonality of anatomy,over a difference of anatomy,nagain, successfully.,We see the same thingnwith the disability rights movement. 
 The problem is, of course,,that, as we begin to looknat all that commonality,,we have to begin to questionnwhy we maintain certain divisions.,Mind you, I want to maintainnsome divisions,,anatomically, in our culture.,For example, I don't want to give a fishnthe same rights as a human.,I don't want to saynwe give up entirely on anatomy.,I don't want to say a five-year-old,should be allowed to consentnto sex or consent to marry.,So there are some anatomical divisions,that make sense to menand that I think we should retain.,But the challenge is tryingnto figure out which ones they are,and why do we retain them,nand do they have meaning. 
 So let's go back to those two beingsnconceived at the beginning of this talk.,We have two beings, both conceived,in the middle of 1979non the exact same day.,Let's imagine one of them, Mary,nis born three months prematurely,,so she's born on June 1, 1980.,Henry, by contrast, is born at term,nso he's born on March 1, 1980.,Simply by virtue of the fact,that Mary was bornnprematurely three months,,she comes into all sorts of rightsnthree months earlier than Henry does --,the right to consent to sex,nthe right to vote, the right to drink.,Henry has to wait for all of that,,not because he's actuallynany different in age, biologically,,except in terms of when he was born. 
 We find other kinds of weirdnessnin terms of what their rights are.,Henry, by virtue of beingnassumed to be male --,although I haven't told younthat he's the XY one --,by virtue of being assumed to be malenis now liable to be drafted,,which Mary does not need to worry about.,Mary, meanwhile, cannot in all the statesnhave the same right,that Henry has in all the states,,namely, the right to marry.,Henry can marry, in every state, a woman,,but Mary can only marry todaynin a few states, a woman. 
 So we have these anatomicalncategories that persist,,that are in many waysnproblematic and questionable.,And the question to me becomes:,What do we do, as our sciencengets to be so good in looking at anatomy,,that we reach the pointnwhere we have to admit,that a democracynthat's been based on anatomy,might start falling apart?,I don't want to give up the science,nbut at the same time,,it feels sometimes like the sciencenis coming out from under us.,So where do we go?,It seems like what happens in our culturenis a sort of pragmatic attitude:,"We have to draw the line somewhere,nso we will draw the line somewhere.",But a lot of people get stucknin a very strange position. 
 So for example, Texas has at one pointndecided that what it means to marry a man,is to mean that you don't havena Y chromosome,,and what it means to marry a womannmeans you have a Y chromosome.,In practice they don't test peoplenfor their chromosomes.,But this is also very bizarre,,because of the story I told younat the beginning,about androgen insensitivity syndrome. 
 If we look at one of the Founding Fathersnof modern democracy,,Dr. Martin Luther King,,he offers us something of a solutionnin his "I have a dream" speech.,He says we should judge peoplen"based not on the color of their skin,,but on the content of their character,",moving beyond anatomy.,And I want to say, "Yeah, that soundsnlike a really good idea.",But in practice, how do you do it?,How do you judge people basednon the content of character?,I also want to point out,that I'm not sure that is how we shouldndistribute rights in terms of humans,,because, I have to admit, that therenare some golden retrievers I know,that are probably more deserving of socialnservices than some humans I know.,I also want to say there are probablynalso some yellow Labradors that I know,that are more capable of informed,nintelligent, mature decisions,about sexual relationsnthan some 40-year-olds that I know. 
 So how do we operationalizenthe question of content of character?,It turns out to be really difficult.,And part of me also wonders,,what if content of character,turns out to be somethingnthat's scannable in the future --,able to be seen with an fMRI?,Do we really want to go there?,I'm not sure where we go. 
 What I do know is that it seemsnto be really important,to think about the ideanof the United States being in the lead,of thinking about this issue of democracy.,We've done a really good jobnstruggling with democracy,,and I think we would dona good job in the future.,We don't have a situationnthat Iran has, for example,,where a man who's sexuallynattracted to other men,is liable to be murdered,,unless he's willingnto submit to a sex change,,in which case he's allowed to live. 
 We don't have that kind of situation.,I'm glad to say we don't haventhe kind of situation with --,a surgeon I talked to a few years ago,who had brought over a setnof conjoined twins,in order to separate them,npartly to make a name for himself.,But when I was on the phone with him,nasking why he'll do this surgery --,this was a very high-risk surgery --nhis answer was that, in this other nation,,these children were going to be treatednvery badly, and so he had to do this.,My response to him was, "Well,nhave you considered political asylum,instead of a separation surgery?",The United States has offeredntremendous possibility,for allowing peoplento be the way they are,,without having them havento be changed for the sake of the state.,So I think we have to be in the lead. 
 Well, just to close,nI want to suggest to you,that I've been talkingna lot about the Fathers.,And I want to thinknabout the possibilities,of what democracy might look like,nor might have looked like,,if we had more involved the mothers.,And I want to say somethingna little bit radical for a feminist,,and that is that I think that there may bendifferent kinds of insights,that can come from differentnkinds of anatomies,,particularly when we havenpeople thinking in groups.,For years, becausenI've been interested in intersex,,I've also been interestednin sex-difference research.,And one of the thingsnthat I've been interested in,is looking at the differencesnbetween males and females,in terms of the way they thinknand operate in the world.,And what we knownfrom cross-cultural studies,is that females, on average --,not everyone, but on average --,are more inclined to be very attentivento complex social relations,and to taking care of people,who are, basically,nvulnerable within the group.,And so if we think about that,,we have an interesting situation in hands. 
 Years ago, when I was in graduate school,,one of my graduate advisorsnwho knew I was interested in feminism --,I considered myselfna feminist, as I still do,,asked a really strange question.,He said, "Tell me what's femininenabout feminism.",And I thought, "Well, that's the dumbestnquestion I've ever heard.,Feminism is all about undoingnstereotypes about gender,,so there's nothingnfeminine about feminism.",But the more I thought about his question,,the more I thought there might bensomething feminine about feminism.,That is to say, there might bensomething, on average,,different about femalenbrains from male brains,that makes us more attentivento deeply complex social relationships,,and more attentivento taking care of the vulnerable. 
 So whereas the Fathersnwere extremely attentive,to figuring out how to protectnindividuals from the state,,it's possible that if we injectednmore mothers into this concept,,what we would have is more of a conceptnof not just how to protect,,but how to care for each other.,And maybe that's wherenwe need to go in the future,,when we take democracy beyond anatomy,,is to think less about the individual bodynin terms of the identity,,and think more about those relationships.,So that as we the peoplentry to create a more perfect union,,we're thinking about what we donfor each other. 
 Thank you.
