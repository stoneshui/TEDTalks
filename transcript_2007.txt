I'm going to try to give you a view of the world as I see it,,the problems and the opportunities that we face,,and then ask the question if we should be optimistic or pessimistic.,And then I'll let you in on a secret, which is why I am an incurable optimist.,Let me start off showing you an Al Gore movie that you may have seen before.,Now, you've all seen "Inconvenient Truth." This is a little more inconvenient. 
 (Video): Man: ... extremely dangerous questions.,Because, with our present knowledge, we have no idea what would happen.,Even now, man may be unwittingly changing the world's climate,through the waste products of his civilization.,Due to our release, through factories and automobiles every year,,of more than six billion tons of carbon dioxide --,which helps air absorb heat from the sun --,our atmosphere seems to be getting warmer.,This is bad?,Well, it's been calculated a few degrees' rise in the earth's temperature would,melt the polar ice caps.,And if this happens, an inland sea would fill a good portion of the Mississippi Valley.,Tourists in glass-bottomed boats would be viewing the drowned towers of Miami,through 150 feet of tropical water.,For, in weather, we're not only dealing with forces of a far greater variety,than even the atomic physicist encounters, but with life itself. 
 Larry Brilliant: Should we feel good, or should we feel bad,that 50 years of foreknowledge accomplished so little?,Well, it depends, really, on what your goals are.,And I think, as my goals, I always go back to Gandhi's talisman.,When Mahatma Gandhi was asked,,"How do you know if the next act that you are about to do is the right one,or the wrong one?" he said, "Consider the face of the poorest,,most vulnerable human being that you ever chanced upon,,and ask yourself if the act that you contemplate will be of benefit to that person.,And if it will be, it's the right thing to do, and if not, rethink it." 
 For those of us in this room, it's not just the poorest and the most vulnerable individual,,it's the community, it's the culture, it's the world itself.,And the trends for those who are at the periphery of our society,,who are the poorest and the most vulnerable,,the trends give rise to a great case for pessimism.,But there's also a wonderful case for optimism.,Let's review them both. First of all, the megatrends.,There's two degrees, or three degrees of climate change baked into the system.,It will cause rising seas. It will cause saline deposited into wells and into lands.,It will disproportionately harm the poorest and the most vulnerable,,as will the increasing rise of population.,Even though we've dodged Paul Ehrlich's population bomb,,and we will not see 20 billion people in this decade, as he had forecast,,we eat as if we were 20 billion.,And we consume so much that again, a rise of 6.5 billion to 9.5 billion,in our grandchildren's lifetime will disproportionately hurt,the poorest and the most vulnerable. 
 That's why they migrate to cities.,That's why in June of this year, we passed, as a species, 51 percent of us living in cities,,and bustees, and slums, and shantytowns.,The rural areas are no longer producing as much food as they did.,The green revolution never reached Africa.,And with desertification, sandstorms, the Gobi Desert, the Ogaden,,we are finding increasing difficulty of a hectare,to produce as many calories as it did even 15 years ago. 
 So humans are turning more towards animal consumption.,In Africa last year, Africans ate 600 million wild animals,,and consumed two billion kilograms of bush meat.,And every kilogram of bush meat contained hundreds of thousands of novel viruses,that have never been charted, the genomic sequences of which we don't know.,Their fitness for creating pandemics we are unaware of,,but we are ripe for zoonotic-borne, emerging communicable diseases. 
 Increasingly, I would say explosive growth of technology.,Most of us are the beneficiaries of that growth. But it has a dark side,-- in bioweapons, and in technology that puts us on a collision course,to magnify any anger, hatred or feeling of marginalization.,And in fact, with increasing globalization --,for which there are big winners and even bigger losers,-- today the world is more diverse and unfair than perhaps it has ever been in history. 
 One percent of us own 40 percent of all the goods and services.,What will happen if the billion people today who live on less than one dollar a day,rise to three billion in the next 30 years?,The one percent will own even more than 40 percent of all the world's goods,and services. Not because they've grown richer,,but because the rest of the world has grown increasingly poorer.,Last week, Bill Clinton at the TED Awards said,,"This situation is unprecedented, unequal, unfair and unstable." 
 So there's lots of reason for pessimism.,Darfur is, at its origin, a resource war.,Last year, there were 85,000 riots in China,,230 a day, that required police or military intervention.,Most of them were about resources.,We are facing an unprecedented number, scale of disasters.,Some are weather-related, human-rights related, epidemics.,And the newly emerging diseases may make H5N1 and bird flu,a quaint forerunner of things to come. It's a destabilized world.,And unlike destabilized world in the past, it will be broadcast to you on YouTube,,you will see it on digital television and on your cell phones.,What will that lead to?,For some, it will lead to anger, religious and sectarian violence and terrorism.,For others, withdrawal, nihilism, materialism.,For us, where does it take us, as social activists and entrepreneurs?,As we look at these trends, do we become despondent, or will we become energized? 
 Let's look at one case, the case of Bangladesh.,First, even if carbon dioxide emissions stopped today,,global warming would continue.,And even with global warming -- if you can see these blue lines,,the dotted line shows that even if emissions of greenhouse gasses stopped today,,the next decades will see rising sea levels.,A minimum of 20 to 30 inches of increase in sea levels is the best case,that we can hope for, and it could be 10 times that.,What will that do to Bangladesh? Let's take a look.,So here's Bangladesh.,70 percent of Bangladesh is at less than five feet above sea level.,Let's go up and take a look at the Himalayas.,And we'll watch as global warming makes them melt. More water comes down,,the deforested areas, here in the Tarai, will be unable to absorb the effluent,,because trees are like straws that suck up the extra seasonal water.,Now we're looking down south, through the Kali Gandaki.,Many of you, I think, have probably trekked here.,And we're going to cruise down and take a look at Bangladesh,and see what the impact will be of twin increases in water,coming from the north, and in the seas rising from the south.,Looking at the five major rivers that feed Bangladesh.,And now let's look from the south, looking up, and let's see this in relief.,A minimum of 20 to 40 inches of increase in seas,,coupled with increasing flows from the Himalayas. And take a look at this.,As many as 100 million refugees from Bangladesh could be expected to migrate,into India and into China.,This is the difficulty that one country faces. 
 But if you look at the globe, all around the earth, wherever there is low-lying area,,populated areas near the water,,you will find increase in sea level that will challenge our way of life.,Sub-Saharan Africa, and even our own San Francisco Bay Area.,We're all in this together.,This is not something that happens far away to people that we don't know.,Global warming is something that happens to all of us, all at once. 
 As are these newly emerging communicable diseases,,names that you hadn't heard 20 years ago: ebola, lhasa fever, monkey pox.,With the erosion of the green belt separating animals from humans,,we live in each other's viral environment.,Do you remember, 20 years ago, no one had ever heard of West Nile fever?,And then we watched, as one case arrived on the East Coast of the United States,and it marched every year, westwardly.,Do you remember no one had heard of ebola,until we heard of hundreds of people dying in Central Africa from it?,It's just the beginning, unfortunately.,There have been 30 novel emerging communicable diseases,that begin in animals that have jumped species in the last 30 years.,It's more than enough reason for pessimism. 
 But now let's look at the case for optimism. (Laughter),Enough of the bad news. Human beings have always risen to the challenge.,You just need to look at the list of Nobel laureates to remind ourselves.,We've been here before, paralyzed by fear, paralyzed into inaction,,when some -- probably one of you in this room -- jumped into the breach,and created an organization like Physicians for Social Responsibility,,which fought against the nuclear threat,,Medicins Sans Frontieres, that renewed our commitment to disaster relief,,Mohamed ElBaradei, and the tremendous hope and optimism that he,brought all of us, and our own Muhammad Yunus. 
 We've seen the eradication of smallpox.,We may see the eradication of polio this year.,Last year, there were only 2,000 cases in the world.,We may see the eradication of guinea worm next year --,there are only 35,000 cases left in the world.,20 years ago, there were three and a half million.,And we've seen a new disease, not like the 30 novel emerging communicable diseases.,This disease is called sudden wealth syndrome. (Laughter),It's an amazing phenomenon.,All throughout the technology world, we're seeing young people bitten by this,disease of sudden wealth syndrome.,But they're using their wealth in a way that their forefathers never did.,They're not waiting until they die to create foundations.,They're actively guiding their money, their resources, their hearts, their commitments,,to make the world a better place.,Certainly, nothing can give you more optimism than that. 
 More reasons to be optimistic:,in the '60s, and I am a creature of the '60s, there was a movement.,We all felt that we were part of it, that a better world was right around the corner,,that we were watching the birth of a world free of hatred and violence and prejudice.,Today, there's another kind of movement. It's a movement to save the earth.,It's just beginning.,Five weeks ago, a group of activists from the business community gathered together,to stop a Texas utility from building nine coal-fired electrical plants,that would have contributed to destroying the environment.,Six months ago, a group of business activists gathered together to join with the,Republican governor in California to pass AB 32,,the most far-reaching legislation in environmental history. 
 Al Gore made presentations in the House and the Senate as an expert witness.,Can you imagine? (Laughter),We're seeing an entente cordiale between science and religion that five years ago,I would not have believed, as the evangelical community,has understood the desperate situation of global warming.,And now 4,000 churches have joined the environmental movement.,It is something to be greatly optimistic about.,The European 20-20-20 plan is an amazing breakthrough,,something that should make all of us feel that hope is on the horizon.,And on April 14th, there will be Step Up Day, where there will be a thousand,individual mobilized social activist movements in the United States on protest,against legislation -- pushing for legislation to stop global warming.,And on July 7th, around the world, I learned only yesterday,,there will be global Live Earth concerts.,And you can feel this optimistic move to save the earth in the air. 
 Now, that doesn't mean that people understand that global warming,hurts the poorest and the weakest the most.,That means that people are beginning the first step,,which is acting out of their own self-interest.,But I am seeing in the major funders, in CARE, Rockefeller,,Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Hewlett, Mercy Corps, you guys, Google,,so many other organizations, a beginning of understanding that we need,to work not just on primary prevention of global warming,,but on the secondary prevention of the consequences of global warming,on the poorest and the most vulnerable. 
 But for me, I have another reason to be an incurable optimist.,And you've heard so many inspiring stories here, and I heard so many last night,that I thought I would share a little bit of mine.,My background is not exactly conventional medical training.,And I lived in a Himalayan monastery, and I studied with a very wise teacher,,who kicked me out of the monastery one day and told me that it was my destiny --,it felt like Yoda -- it is your destiny to go to work for WHO,and to help eradicate smallpox,,at a time when there was no smallpox program. 
 It should make you optimistic that smallpox no longer exists,because it was the worst disease in history.,In the last century -- that's the one that was seven years ago --,half a billion people died from smallpox:,more than all the wars in history,,more than any other infectious disease in the history of the world.,In the Summer of Love, in 1967, two million people, children, died of smallpox.,It's not ancient history.,When you read the biblical plague of boils, that was smallpox.,Pharaoh Ramses the Fifth, whose picture is here, died of smallpox.,To eradicate smallpox, we had to gather the largest United Nations army in history.,We visited every house in India, searching for smallpox -- 120 million houses,,once every month, for nearly two years.,In a cruel reversal, after we had almost conquered smallpox --,and this is what you must learn as a social entrepreneur, the realm of the final inch. 
 When we had almost eradicated smallpox, it came back again,,because the company town of Tatanagar drew laborers,,who could come there and get employment.,And they caught smallpox in the one remaining place that had smallpox,,and they went home to die.,And when they did, they took smallpox to 10 other countries,and reignited the epidemic.,And we had to start all over again.,But, in the end, we succeeded, and the last case of smallpox:,this little girl, Rahima Banu -- Barisal, in Bangladesh --,when she coughed or breathed, and the last virus of smallpox left her lungs,and fell on the dirt and the sun killed that last virus,,thus ended a chain of transmission of history's greatest horror. 
 How can that not make you optimistic?,A disease which killed hundreds of thousands in India, and blinded half of,all of those who were made blind in India, ended.,And most importantly for us here in this room, a bond was created.,Doctors, health workers, from 30 different countries,,of every race, every religion, every color, worked together,,fought alongside each other,,fought against a common enemy, didn't fight against each other.,How can that not make you feel optimistic for the future?,Thank you very much.,(Applause)As an architect you design for the present,,with an awareness of the past,,for a future which is essentially unknown.,The green agenda is probably the most important agenda,and issue of the day.,And I'd like to share some experience,over the last 40 years -- we celebrate our fortieth anniversary this year --,and to explore and to touch on some observations,about the nature of sustainability.,How far you can anticipate, what follows from it,,what are the threats, what are the possibilities,,the challenges, the opportunities?,I think that -- I've said in the past, many, many years ago,,before anybody even invented the concept of a green agenda,,that it wasn't about fashion -- it was about survival. 
 But what I never said, and what I'm really going to make the point is,,that really, green is cool.,I mean, all the projects which have, in some way, been inspired,by that agenda are about a celebratory lifestyle,,in a way celebrating the places and the spaces,which determine the quality of life.,I rarely actually quote anything,,so I'm going to try and find a piece of paper if I can,,[in] which somebody, at the end of last year, ventured the thought,about what for that individual, as a kind of important observer,,analyst, writer -- a guy called Thomas Friedman,,who wrote in the Herald Tribune, about 2006.,He said,,"I think the most important thing to happen in 2006,was that living and thinking green hit Main Street.,We reached a tipping point this year,where living, acting, designing, investing and manufacturing green,came to be understood by a critical mass,of citizens, entrepreneurs and officials,as the most patriotic, capitalistic, geo-political,and competitive thing they could do.,Hence my motto: green is the new red, white and blue." 
 And I asked myself, in a way, looking back,,"When did that kind of awareness of the planet and its fragility first appear?",And I think it was July 20, 1969,,when, for the first time, man could look back at planet Earth.,And, in a way, it was Buckminster Fuller who coined that phrase.,And before the kind of collapse of the communist system,,I was privileged to meet a lot of cosmonauts,in Space City and other places in Russia.,And interestingly, as I think back,,they were the first true environmentalists.,They were filled with a kind of pioneering passion,,fired about the problems of the Aral Sea.,And at that period it was --,in a way, a number of things were happening.,Buckminster Fuller was the kind of green guru --,again, a word that had not been coined.,He was a design scientist, if you like, a poet,,but he foresaw all the things that are happening now.,It's another subject. It's another conversation.,You can go back to his writings: it's quite extraordinary.,It was at that time, with an awareness,fired by Bucky's prophecies, his concerns,as a citizen, as a kind of citizen of the planet,,that influenced my thinking and what we were doing at that time. 
 And it's a number of projects.,I select this one because it was 1973, and it was a master plan,for one of the Canary Islands.,And this probably coincided with the time,when you had the planet Earth's sourcebook,,and you had the hippie movement.,And there are some of those qualities in this drawing,,which seeks to sum up the recommendations.,And all the components are there which are now,in common parlance, in our vocabulary,,you know, 30-odd years later:,wind energy, recycling, biomass, solar cells.,And in parallel at that time, there was,a very kind of exclusive design club.,People who were really design conscious,were inspired by the work of Dieter Rams,,and the objects that he would create,for the company called Braun.,This is going back the mid-'50s, '60s.,And despite Bucky's prophecies,that everything would be miniaturized,and technology would make an incredible style --,access to comfort, to amenities --,it was very, very difficult to imagine,that everything that we see in this image,,would be very, very stylishly packaged.,And that, and more besides, would be in the palm of your hand. 
 And I think that that digital revolution,now is coming to the point,where, as the virtual world, which brings so many people together here,,finally connects with the physical world,,there is the reality that that has become humanized,,so that digital world has all the friendliness,,all the immediacy, the orientation of the analog world.,Probably summed up in a way,by the stylish or alternative available here,,as we generously had gifted at lunchtime,,the [unclear], which is a further kind of development --,and again, inspired by the incredible sort of sensual feel.,A very, very beautiful object.,So, something which in [the] '50s, '60s was very exclusive,has now become, interestingly, quite inclusive.,And the reference to the iPod as iconic,,and in a way evocative of performance, delivery --,quite interesting that [in] the beginning of the year 2007,,the Financial Times commented that the Detroit companies,envy the halo effect that Toyota has gained,from the Prius as the hybrid, energy-conscious vehicle,,which rivals the iPod as an iconic product. 
 And I think it's very tempting to, in a way, seduce ourselves --,as architects, or anybody involved with the design process --,that the answer to our problems lies with buildings.,Buildings are important, but,they're only a component of a much bigger picture.,In other words, as I might seek to demonstrate,,if you could achieve the impossible,,the equivalent of perpetual motion,,you could design a carbon-free house, for example.,That would be the answer.,Unfortunately, it's not the answer.,It's only the beginning of the problem.,You cannot separate the buildings out,from the infrastructure of cites,and the mobility of transit.,For example, if, in that Bucky-inspired phrase, we draw back,and we look at planet Earth,,and we take a kind of typical, industrialized society,,then the energy consumed would be split,between the buildings, 44 percent, transport, 34 percent, and industry.,But again, that only shows part of the picture.,If you looked at the buildings together with the associated transport,,in other words, the transport of people, which is 26 percent,,then 70 percent of the energy consumption,is influenced by the way that our cites and infrastructure work together. 
 So the problems of sustainability,cannot be separated from the nature of the cities,,of which the buildings are a part.,For example, if you take, and you make a comparison,between a recent kind of city,,what I'll call, simplistically, a North American city --,and Detroit is not a bad example, it is very car dependent.,The city goes out in annular rings,,consuming more and more green space,,and more and more roads, and more and more energy,in the transport of people between the city center --,which again, the city center, as it becomes deprived,of the living and just becomes commercial, again becomes dead.,If you compared Detroit with a city of a Northern European example --,and Munich is not a bad example of that,,with the greater dependence on walking and cycling --,then a city which is really only twice as dense,,is only using one-tenth of the energy.,In other words, you take these comparable examples,and the energy leap is enormous. 
 So basically, if you wanted to generalize, you can demonstrate,that as the density increases along the bottom there,,that the energy consumed reduces dramatically.,Of course you can't separate this out from issues like,social diversity, mass transit,,the ability to be able to walk a convenient distance,,the quality of civic spaces.,But again, you can see Detroit, in yellow at the top,,extraordinary consumption, down below Copenhagen.,And Copenhagen, although it's a dense city,,is not dense compared with the really dense cities.,In the year 2000, a rather interesting thing happened.,You had for the first time mega-cities, [of] 5 million or more,,which were occurring in the developing world.,And now, out of typically 46 cities,,33 of those mega-cities are in the developing world.,So you have to ask yourself -- the environmental impact of,,for example, China or India.,If you take China, and you just take Beijing,,you can see on that traffic system,,and the pollution associated with the consumption of energy,as the cars expand at the price of the bicycles.,In other words, if you put onto the roads, as is currently happening,,1,000 new cars every day --,statistically, it's the biggest booming auto market in the world --,and the half a billion bicycles serving one and a third billion people are reducing. 
 And that urbanization is extraordinary, accelerated pace.,So, if we think of the transition in our society,of the movement from the land to the cities, which took 200 years,,then that same process is happening in 20 years.,In other words, it is accelerating by a factor of 10.,And quite interestingly, over something like a 60-year period,,we're seeing the doubling in life expectancy,,over that period where the urbanization has trebled.,If I pull back from that global picture,,and I look at the implication over a similar period of time,in terms of the technology -- which, as a tool,,is a tool for designers,,and I cite our own experience as a company,,and I just illustrate that by a small selection of projects --,then how do you measure that change of technology?,How does it affect the design of buildings?,And particularly, how can it lead,to the creation of buildings which consume less energy,,create less pollution and are more socially responsible? 
 That story, in terms of buildings, started in the late '60s, early '70s.,The one example I take is a corporate headquarters,for a company called Willis and Faber,,in a small market town in the northeast of England,,commuting distance with London.,And here, the first thing you can see,is that this building, the roof is a very warm kind of,overcoat blanket, a kind of insulating garden,,which is also about the celebration of public space.,In other words, for this community, they have this garden in the sky.,So the humanistic ideal is very, very strong in all this work,,encapsulated perhaps by one of my early sketches here,,where you can see greenery, you can see sunlight,,you have a connection with nature.,And nature is part of the generator, the driver for this building.,And symbolically, the colors of the interior are green and yellow.,It has facilities like swimming pools, it has flextime,,it has a social heart, a space, you have contact with nature.,Now this was 1973. 
 In 2001, this building received an award.,And the award was about a celebration for a building,which had been in use over a long period of time.,And the people who'd created it came back:,the project managers, the company chairmen then.,And they were saying, you know,,"The architects, Norman was always going on about,designing for the future, and you know,,it didn't seem to cost us any more.,So we humored him, we kept him happy.",The image at the top,,what it doesn't -- if you look at it in detail,,really what it is saying is you can wire this building.,This building was wired for change.,So, in 1975, the image there is of typewriters.,And when the photograph was taken, it's word processors.,And what they were saying on this occasion was that our competitors,had to build new buildings for the new technology.,We were fortunate,,because in a way our building was future-proofed.,It anticipated change, even though those changes were not known.,Round about that design period leading up to this building,,I did a sketch, which we pulled out of the archive recently.,And I was saying, and I wrote, "But we don't have the time,,and we really don't have the immediate expertise,at a technical level." 
 In other words, we didn't have the technology,to do what would be really interesting on that building.,And that would be to create a kind of three-dimensional bubble --,a really interesting overcoat that would naturally ventilate,,would breathe and would seriously reduce the energy loads.,Notwithstanding the fact that the building, as a green building,,is very much a pioneering building.,And if I fast-forward in time, what is interesting,is that the technology is now available and celebratory.,The library of the Free University, which opened last year,,is an example of that.,And again, the transition from one of the many thousands,of sketches and computer images to the reality.,And a combination of devices here,,the kind of heavy mass concrete of these book stacks,,and the way in which that is enclosed by this skin,,which enables the building to be ventilated,,to consume dramatically less energy,,and where it's really working with the forces of nature. 
 And what is interesting is that this is hugely popular,by the people who use it.,Again, coming back to that thing about the lifestyle,,and in a way, the ecological agenda is very much at one with the spirit.,So it's not a kind of sacrifice, quite the reverse.,I think it's a great -- it's a celebration.,And you can measure the performance,,in terms of energy consumption, of that building,against a typical library.,If I show another aspect of that technology,then, in a completely different context --,this apartment building in the Alps in Switzerland.,Prefabricated from the most traditional of materials,,but that material -- because of the technology, the computing ability,,the ability to prefabricate, make high-performance components,out of timber -- very much at the cutting edge.,And just to give a sort of glimpse of that technology,,the ability to plot points in the sky,and to transmit, to transfer that information,now, directly into the factory. 
 So if you cross the border -- just across the border --,a small factory in Germany, and here you can see the guy with his computer screen,,and those points in space are communicated.,And on the left are the cutting machines,,which then, in the factory,,enable those individual pieces to be fabricated,and plus or minus very, very few millimeters,,to be slotted together on site.,And then interestingly, that building to then be clad,in the oldest technology, which is the kind of hand-cut shingles.,One quarter of a million of them applied by hand as the final finish.,And again, the way in which that works as a building,,for those of us who can enjoy the spaces,,to live and visit there.,If I made the leap into these new technologies,,then how did we -- what happened before that?,I mean, you know, what was life like before the mobile phone,,the things that you take for granted? 
 Well, obviously the building still happened.,I mean, this is a glimpse of the interior of our Hong Kong bank of 1979,,which opened in 1985, with the ability to be able to reflect sunlight,deep into the heart of this space here.,And in the absence of computers, you have to physically model.,So for example, we would put models under an artificial sky.,For wind tunnels, we would literally put them,in a wind tunnel and blast air,,and the many kilometers of cable and so on.,And the turning point was probably, in our terms,,when we had the first computer.,And that was at the time that we sought,to redesign, reinvent the airport.,This is Terminal Four at Heathrow, typical of any terminal --,big, heavy roof, blocking out the sunlight,,lots of machinery, big pipes, whirring machinery. 
 And Stansted, the green alternative,,which uses natural light, is a friendly place:,you know where you are, you can relate to the outside.,And for a large part of its cycle, not needing electric light --,electric light, which in turn creates more heat,,which creates more cooling loads and so on.,And at that particular point in time,,this was one of the few solitary computers.,And that's a little image of the tree of Stansted.,Not going back very far in time, 1990,,that's our office.,And if you looked very closely, you'd see,that people were drawing with pencils,,and they were pushing, you know, big rulers and triangles.,It's not that long ago, 17 years, and here we are now.,I mean, major transformation. 
 Going back in time, there was a lady called Valerie Larkin,,and in 1987, she had all our information on one disk.,Now, every week, we have the equivalent of 84 million disks,,which record our archival information,on past, current and future projects.,That reaches 21 kilometers into the sky.,This is the view you would get, if you looked down on that.,But meanwhile, as you know,,wonderful protagonists like Al Gore,are noting the inexorable rise in temperature,,set in the context of that,,interestingly, those buildings which are celebratory,and very, very relevant to this place. 
 Our Reichstag project,,which has a very familiar agenda, I'm sure,,as a public place where we sought to, in a way,,through a process of advocacy,,reinterpret the relationship between society and politicians,,public space. And maybe its hidden agenda, an energy manifesto --,something that would be free, completely free,of fuel as we know it.,So it would be totally renewable.,And again, the humanistic sketch, the translation into the public space,,but this very, very much a part of the ecology.,But here, not having to model it for real.,Obviously the wind tunnel had a place,,but the ability now with the computer,to explore, to plan, to see how that would work,in terms of the forces of nature:,natural ventilation, to be able to model the chamber below,,and to look at biomass.,A combination of biomass, aquifers, burning vegetable oil --,a process that, quite interestingly, was developed,in Eastern Germany, at the time of its,dependence on the Soviet Bloc. 
 So really, retranslating that technology and developing something,which was so clean, it was virtually pollution-free.,You can measure it again.,You can compare how that building, in terms of its emission,in tons of carbon dioxide per year --,at the time that we took that project, over 7,000 tons --,what it would have been with natural gas,and finally, with the vegetable oil, 450 tons.,I mean, a 94 percent reduction -- virtually clean.,We can see the same processes at work,in terms of the Commerce Bank --,its dependence on natural ventilation,,the way that you can model those gardens,,the way they spiral around.,But again, very much about the lifestyle, the quality --,something that would be more enjoyable as a place to work.,And again, we can measure the reduction,in terms of energy consumption. 
 There is an evolution here between the projects,,and Swiss Re again develops that a little bit further --,the project in the city in London.,And this sequence shows the buildup of that model.,But what it shows first, which I think is quite interesting,,is that here you see the circle, you see the public space around it.,What are the other ways of putting,the same amount of space on the site?,If, for example, you seek to do a building,which goes right to the edge of the pavement,,it's the same amount of space.,And finally, you profile this, you cut grooves into it.,The grooves become the kind of green lungs,which give views, which give light, ventilation,,make the building fresher.,And you enclose that with something that also,is central to its appearance,,which is a mesh of triangulated structures --,again, in a long connection evocative of,some of those works of Buckminster Fuller,,and the way in which triangulation can increase performance,and also give that building its sense of identity. 
 And here, if we look at a detail of the way,that the building opens up and breathes into those atria,,the way in which now, with a computer, we can model the forces,,we can see the high pressure, the low pressure,,the way in which the building behaves rather like an aircraft wing.,So it also has the ability, all the time,,regardless of the direction of the wind,,to be able to make the building fresh and efficient.,And unlike conventional buildings,,the top of the building is celebratory.,It's a viewing place for people, not machinery.,And the base of the building is again about public space.,Comparing it with a typical building,,what happens if we seek to use such design strategies,in terms of really large-scale thinking?,And I'm just going to give two images,out of a kind of company research project. 
 It's been well known that the Dead Sea is dying.,The level is dropping, rather like the Aral Sea.,And the Dead Sea is obviously much lower,than the oceans and seas around it.,So there has been a project which rescues the Dead Sea,by creating a pipeline, a pipe,,sometimes above the surface, sometimes buried,,that will redress that, and will feed from the Gulf of Aqaba,into the Dead Sea.,And our translation of that,,using a lot of the thinking built up over the 40 years, is to say,,what if that, instead of being just a pipe,,what if it is a lifeline?,What if it is the equivalent, depending on where you are,,of the Grand Canal,,in terms of tourists, habitation, desalination, agriculture?,In other words, water is the lifeblood. 
 And if you just go back to the previous image,,and you look at this area of volatility and hostility,,that a unifying design idea as a humanitarian gesture,could have the affect of bringing all those warring factions together,in a united cause, in terms of something that would be,genuinely green and productive in the widest sense.,Infrastructure at that large scale is also,inseparable from communication.,And whether that communication is the virtual world,or it is the physical world,,then it's absolutely central to society.,And how do we make more legible in this growing world,,especially in some of the places that I'm talking about --,China, for example, which in the next ten years,will create 400 new airports.,Now what form do they take?,How do you make them more friendly at that scale? 
 Hong Kong I refer to as a kind of analog experience in a digital age,,because you always have a point of reference.,So what happens when we take that and you expand that further,into the Chinese society?,And what is interesting is that that produces in a way,perhaps the ultimate mega-building.,It is physically the largest project on the planet at the moment.,250 -- excuse me, 50,000 people working 24 hours, seven days.,Larger by 17 percent than every terminal put together,at Heathrow -- built -- plus the new, un-built Terminal Five.,And the challenge here is a building that will be green,,that is compact despite its size,and is about the human experience of travel,,is about friendly, is coming back to that starting point,,is very, very much about the lifestyle.,And perhaps these, in the end, as celebratory spaces. 
 As Hubert was talking over lunch,,as we sort of engaged in conversation,,talked about this, talked about cities.,Hubert was saying, absolutely correctly, "These are the new cathedrals.",And in a way, one aspect of this conversation,was triggered on New Year's Eve,,when I was talking about the Olympic agenda in China,in terms of its green ambitions and aspirations.,And I was voicing the thought that --,it just crossed my mind that New Year's Eve,,a sort of symbolic turning point as we move from 2006 to 2007 --,that maybe, you know, the future was,the most powerful, innovative sort of nation.,The way in which somebody like Kennedy inspirationally could say,,"We put a man on the moon." 
 You know, who is going to say,that we cracked this thing of the dependence on fossil fuels,,with all that being held to ransom by rogue regimes, and so on.,And that's a concerted platform.,It's more than one device, you know, it's renewable.,And I voiced the thought that maybe at the turn of the year,,I thought that the inspiration was more likely,to come from those other, larger countries out there --,the Chinas, the Indias, the Asian-Pacific tigers.,Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)This is a work in process,,based on some commentsnthat were made at TED two years ago,about the need for the storage of vaccine. 
 (Video): [On this planet,1.6 billion people,don't have access to electricity,refrigeration,or stored fuels,this is a problem,it impacts:,the spread of disease,the storage of food and medicine,and the quality of life.,So here's the plan ...ninexpensive refrigeration,that doesn't use electricity,npropane, gas, kerosene or consumables,time for some thermodynamics,And the story of the IntermittentnAbsorption Refrigerator] 
 Adam Grosser: So 29 years ago,nI had this thermo teacher,who talked about absorptionnand refrigeration, one of those things,that stuck in my head, a lotnlike the Stirling engine:,it was cool, but you didn't knownwhat to do with it.,It was invented in 1858,nby this guy Ferdinand Carré,,but he couldn't actually buildnanything with it,because of the tools at the time. 
 This crazy Canadian named Powel Crosleyncommercialized this thing,called the IcyBall, in 1928.,It was a really neat idea,nand I'll get to why it didn't work,,but here's how it works.,There's two spheresnand they're separated in distance.,One has a working fluid,nwater and ammonia,,and the other is a condenser.,You heat up one side, the hot side.,The ammonia evaporatesnand it recondenses in the other side.,You let it cool to room temperature,,and then, as the ammonia reevaporatesnand combines with the water,back on the erstwhile hot side,,it creates a powerful cooling effect.,So it was a great ideanthat didn't work at all.,They blew up. 
 (Laughter) 
 Because you're using ammonia,nyou get hugely high pressures,if you heated them wrong;,it topped 400 psi.,The ammonia was toxic,nit sprayed everywhere.,But it was kind of an interesting thought. 
 So the great thing about 2006,,there's a lot of really greatncomputational work you can do.,So we got the whole thermodynamicsndepartment at Stanford involved --,a lot of computational fluid dynamics.,We proved that most of the ammonianrefrigeration tables are wrong.,We found some nontoxic refrigerants,that worked at very low vapor pressures.,We brought in a team from the UK --,a lot of great refrigeration people,nit turns out, in the UK --,and built a test rig,nand proved that, in fact,,we could make a low-pressure,nnontoxic refrigerator. 
 So this is the way it works.,You put it on a cooking fire.,Most people havencooking fires in the world,,whether it's camel dung or wood.,It heats up for about 30 minutes,ncools for an hour.,You put it into a containernand it will refrigerate for 24 hours.,It looks like this.,This is the fifth prototype,nit's not quite done.,It weighs about eight pounds,nand this is the way it works.,You put it into a 15-liter vessel,nabout three gallons,,and it'll cool it downnto just above freezing --,three degrees above freezing --,for 24 hours in a 30 degree C environment.,It's really cheap.,We think we can build thesenin high volumes for about 25 dollars,,in low volumes for about 40 dollars.,And we think we can make refrigerationnsomething that everybody can have. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Good morning.,Happy to see so many fine folks out here,and so many smiling faces.,I have a very peculiar,background, attitude and approach,to the real world,because I am a conjurer.,Now, I prefer that term over magician,,because if I were a magician, that would mean,that I use spells and incantations,and weird gestures,in order to accomplish real magic.,No, I don't do that; I'm a conjurer,,who is someone who pretends to be,a real magician. (Laughter) 
 Now, how do we go about that sort of thing?,We depend on the fact,that audiences, such as yourselves,,will make assumptions.,For example, when I walked up here,and I took the microphone from the stand,and switched it on,,you assumed this was a microphone, which it is not.,(Laughter),As a matter of fact, this is something,that about half of you, more than half of you will not be familiar with.,It's a beard trimmer, you see?,And it makes a very bad microphone;,I've tried it many times. (Laughter),The other assumption that you made --,and this little lesson is to show you,that you will make assumptions.,Not only that you can, but that you will,when they are properly suggested to you.,You believe I'm looking at you.,Wrong. I'm not looking at you. I can't see you.,I know you're out there, they told me backstage, it's a full house and such.,I know you're there because I can hear you,,but I can't see you because I normally wear glasses.,These are not glasses, these are empty frames. (Laughter),Quite empty frames. 
 Now why would a grown man appear before you,wearing empty frames on his face?,To fool you, ladies and gentlemen,,to deceive you, to show that you, too,,can make assumptions.,Don't you ever forget that.,Now, I have to do something -- first of all, switch to real glasses,so I can actually see you,,which would probably be a convenience. I don't know.,I haven't had a good look. Well, it's not that great a convenience. 
 (Laughter) 
 I have to do something now, which seems,a little bit strange for a magician.,But I'm going to take some medication.,This is a full bottle of,Calms Forte.,I'll explain that in just a moment.,Ignore the instructions,,that's what the government has to put in there,to confuse you, I'm sure.,I will take enough of these. Mm.,Indeed, the whole container.,Thirty-two tablets of Calms Forte. 
 Now that I've done that -- I'll explain it in a moment --,I must tell you that,I am an actor.,I'm an actor who plays a specific part.,I play the part of a magician,,a wizard, if you will, a real wizard.,If someone were to appear on this stage in front of me,and actually claim to be,an ancient prince of Denmark named Hamlet,,you would be insulted,and rightly so.,Why would a man assume that you would believe,something bizarre like this?,But there exists out there,a very large population,of people who will tell you,that they have psychic, magical powers,that they can predict the future,,that they can make contact with the deceased.,Oh, they also say,they will sell you astrology,or other fortunetelling methods.,Oh, they gladly sell you that, yes.,And they also say,that they can give you perpetual motion machines,and free energy systems.,They claim to be psychics,,or sensitives, whatever they can. 
 But the one thing that has made a big comeback,just recently,is this business of,speaking with the dead.,Now, to my innocent mind,,dead implies,incapable of communicating. (Laughter),You might agree with me on that.,But these people, they tend to tell you that,not only can they communicate with the dead --,"Hi, there" --,but they can hear the dead as well,,and they can relay this information back to the living.,I wonder if that's true.,I don't think so, because,this subculture of people,use exactly the same gimmicks that we magicians do,,exactly the same --,the same physical methods, the same psychological methods --,and they effectively and profoundly,deceive millions of people around the earth,,to their detriment.,They deceive these people,,costs them a lot of money,,cost them a lot of emotional anguish.,Billions of dollars are spent,every year, all over the globe,,on these charlatans. 
 Now, I have two questions,I would like to ask these people,if I had the opportunity to do so.,First question: If I want to ask them to call up --,because they do hear them through the ear.,They listen to the spirits like this --,I'm going to ask you to call up the ghost of my grandmother,because, when she died, she had the family will,,and she secreted it someplace. We don't know where it is,,so we ask Granny, "Where is the will, Granny?",What does Granny say? She says, "I'm in heaven and it's wonderful.,I'm here with all my old friends, my deceased friends,,and my family,and all the puppy dogs and the kittens that I used to have when I was a little girl.,And I love you, and I'll always be with you.,Good bye.",And she didn't answer the damn question!,Where is the will?,Now, she could easily have said,,"Oh, it's in the library on the second shelf, behind the encyclopedia,",but she doesn't say that. No, she doesn't.,She doesn't bring any useful information to us.,We paid a lot of money for that information,,be we didn't get it. 
 The second question that I'd like to ask, rather simple:,Suppose I ask them to contact,the spirit of my deceased father-in-law, as an example.,Why do they insist on saying --,remember, they speak into this ear --,why do they say, "My name starts with J or M?",Is this a hunting game?,Hunting and fishing? What is it?,Is it 20 questions? No, it's more like 120 questions.,But it is a cruel, vicious,,absolutely conscienceless --,I'll be all right, keep your seats (Laughter) --,game that these people play.,And they take advantage of the innocent, the naive,,the grieving, the needy people out there. 
 Now, this is a process,that is called cold reading.,There's one fellow out there,,Van Praagh is his name, James Van Praagh.,He's one of the big practitioners of this sort of thing.,John Edward, Sylvia Browne,and Rosemary Altea, they are other operators.,There are hundreds of them all over the earth, but in this country,,James Van Praagh is very big.,And what does he do? He likes to tell you,how the deceased got deceased,,the people he's talking to through his ear, you see?,So what he says is, very often, is like this: he says,,"He tells me, he tells me, before he passed,,that he had trouble breathing.",Folks, that's what dying is all about!,(Laughter),You stop breathing, and then you're dead.,It's that simple.,And that's the kind of information they're going to bring back to you?,I don't think so.,Now, these people will make guesses, they'll say things like,,"Why am I getting electricity?,He's saying to me, 'Electricity.',Was he an electrician?" "No.","Did he ever have an electric razor?" "No.",It was a game of hunting questions like this.,This is what they go through. 
 Now, folks often ask us,at the James Randi Educational Foundation,,they call me, they say, "Why are you so concerned about this, Mr. Randi?,Isn't it just a lot of fun?",No, it is not fun. It is a cruel farce.,Now, it may bring a certain amount of comfort,,but that comfort lasts,only about 20 minutes or so.,And then the people look in the mirror, and they say,,I just paid a lot of money for that reading.,And what did she say to me? 'I love you!'",They always say that.,They don't get any information,,they don't get any value for what they spend. 
 Now, Sylvia Browne is the big operator.,We call her "The Talons.",Sylvia Browne -- thank you --,Sylvia Browne is the big operator,in this field at this very moment.,Now, Sylvia Browne -- just to show you --,she actually gets 700 dollars,for a 20 minute reading over the telephone,,she doesn't even go there in person,,and you have to wait up to two years because,she's booked ahead that amount of time.,You pay by credit card or whatever,,and then she will call you,sometime in the next two years.,You can tell it's her. "Hello, this is Sylvia Browne.",That's her, you can tell right away.,Now, Montel Williams is an intelligent man.,We all know who he is on television.,He's well educated, he's smart,,he knows what Sylvia Browne is doing,but he doesn't give a damn.,He just doesn't care.,Because, the bottom line is, the sponsors love it,,and he will expose her,to television publicity all the time. 
 Now, what does Sylvia Browne give you for that 700 dollars?,She gives you the names of your guardian angels, that's first.,Now, without that, how could we possibly function? (Laughter),She gives you the names of previous lives,,who you were in previous lives.,Duh.,It turns out that the women,that she gives readings for,were all Babylonian princesses, or something like that.,And the men were all Grecian warriors,fighting with Agamemnon.,Nothing is ever said about,a 14 year-old bootblack in the streets of London,who died of consumption.,He isn't worth bringing back, obviously.,And the strange thing -- folks, you may have noticed this too.,You see these folks on television --,they never call anybody back from hell. (Laughter),Everyone comes back from heaven, but never from hell.,If they call back any of my friends,,they're not going to... Well, you see the story. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, Sylvia Browne is an exception,,an exception in one way,,because the James Randi Educational Foundation, my foundation,,offers a one million dollar prize in negotiable bonds.,Very simply won.,All you have to do is prove any paranormal, occult,or supernatural event or power of any kind,under proper observing conditions.,It's very easy, win the million dollars.,Sylvia Browne is an exception in that,she's the only professional psychic,in the whole world,that has accepted our challenge.,She did this on the "Larry King Live" show on CNN,six and a half years ago.,And we haven't heard from her since. Strange.,She said that, first of all, that she didn't know how to contact me.,Duh.,A professional psychic who speaks to dead people,,she can't reach me?,(Laughter),I'm alive, you may have noticed.,Well, pretty well anyway.,She couldn't reach me. Now she says she doesn't want to reach me,because I'm a godless person.,All the more reason to take the million dollars,,wouldn't you think, Sylvia? 
 Now these people need to be stopped, seriously now.,They need to be stopped because this is a cruel farce.,We get people coming to the foundation all the time.,They're ruined financially and emotionally,because they've given their money and their faith,to these people. 
 Now, I popped some pills earlier.,I have to explain that to you.,Homeopathy, let's find out what that's all about.,Hmm. You've heard of it.,It's an alternative form of healing, right?,Homeopathy actually consists -- and that's what this is.,This is Calms Forte,,32 caplets of sleeping pills! I forgot to tell you that.,I just ingested,six and a half days worth of sleeping pills.,(Laughter),Six and a half days, that certainly is a fatal dose.,It says right on the back here,,"In case of overdose,,contact your poison control center immediately,",and it gives an 800 number.,Keep your seats -- it's going to be okay.,I don't really need it,because I've been doing this stunt,for audiences all over the world,for the last eight or 10 years,,taking fatal doses of homeopathic sleeping pills. 
 Why don't they affect me?,(Laughter),(Applause),The answer may surprise you.,What is homeopathy?,It's taking a medicine that really works,and diluting it down,well beyond Avogadro's limit.,Diluting it down to the point,where there's none of it left. (Laughter),Now folks, this is not,just a metaphor I'm going to give you now, it's true.,It's exactly equivalent to taking,one 325 milligram aspirin tablet,,throwing it into the middle of Lake Tahoe,,and then stirring it up, obviously with a very big stick,,and waiting two years or so,until the solution is homogeneous.,Then, when you get a headache,,you take a sip of this water, and -- voila! -- it is gone.,(Laughter),Now that is true. That is what homeopathy is all about. 
 And another claim that they make -- you'll love this one --,the more dilute the medicine is, they say,,the more powerful it is.,Now wait a minute, we heard about a guy in Florida.,The poor man, he was on homeopathic medicine.,He died of an overdose.,He forgot to take his pill.,(Laughter),Work on it. Work on it.,It's a ridiculous thing. It is absolutely ridiculous.,I don't know what we're doing,,believing in all this nonsense over all these years. 
 Now, let me tell you,,The James Randi Educational Foundation,is waving this very big carrot,,but I must say, the fact that nobody,has taken us up on this offer,doesn't mean that the powers don't exist.,They might, some place out there.,Maybe these people are just independently wealthy.,Well, with Sylvia Browne I would think so.,You know, 700 dollars for a 20 minute reading,over the telephone --,that's more than lawyers make!,I mean that's a fabulous amount of money.,These people don't need the million dollars perhaps,,but wouldn't you think they'd like to take it,just to make me look silly?,Just to get rid of this godless person out there,that Sylvia Browne talks about all the time? 
 I think that something needs to be done about this.,We really would love to have suggestions from you folks,on how to contact federal, state,and local authorities,to get them to do something.,If you find out -- now I understand.,We've seen people, even today, speaking to us,about AIDS epidemics,and starving kids around the world,and impure water supplies that people have to suffer with.,Those are very important,,critically important to us.,And we must do something about those problems.,But at the same time,,as Arthur C. Clarke said,,The rotting of the human mind,,the business of believing in the paranormal and the occult,and the supernatural --,all of this total nonsense,,this medieval thinking --,I think something should be done about that,,and it all lies in education.,Largely, it's the media,who are to blame for this sort of thing.,They shamelessly promote,all kinds of nonsense of this sort,because it pleases the sponsors.,It's the bottom line, the dollar line.,That's what they're looking at. 
 We really must do something about this.,I'm willing to take your suggestions,,and I'm willing to have you,tune in to our webpage.,It's www.randi.org.,Go in there and look at the archives,,and you will begin to understand much more,of what I've been talking about today.,You will see the records that we have.,There's nothing like sitting in that library,and having a family appear there,and say that Mum gave away all the family fortune.,She cashed in the CDs,,she gave away the stocks and the certificates.,That's really sad to hear,,and it hasn't helped them one bit,,hasn't solved any of their problems.,Yes, there could be a rotting of the American mind,,and of the minds all the way around the earth,,if we don't start to think sensibly about these things. 
 Now, we've offered this carrot,,as I say, we've dangled the carrot.,We're waiting for the psychics to come forth and snap at it.,Oh, we get lots of them,,hundreds of them every year come by.,These are dowsers and people,who think that they can talk to the dead as well,,but they're amateurs; they don't know how to evaluate,their own so-called powers.,The professionals never come near us,,except in that case of Sylvia Browne,that I told you about a moment ago.,She did accept and then backed away.,Ladies and gentlemen,,I'm James Randi,,and I'm waiting. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm going to try and explain why it is that perhaps,we don't understand as much as we think we do.,I'd like to begin with four questions.,This is not some sort of cultural thing for the time of year.,That's an in-joke, by the way.,But these four questions, actually,,are ones that people who even know quite a lot about science find quite hard.,And they're questions that I've asked of science television producers,,of audiences of science educators --,so that's science teachers -- and also of seven-year-olds,,and I find that the seven-year-olds do marginally better,than the other audiences, which is somewhat surprising. 
 So the first question, and you might want to write this down,,either on a bit of paper, physically, or a virtual piece of paper,in your head. And, for viewers at home, you can try this as well.,A little seed weighs next to nothing and a tree weighs a lot, right?,I think we agree on that. Where does the tree get the stuff that makes up this chair,,right? Where does all this stuff come from?,(Knocks) 
 And your next question is, can you light a little torch-bulb,with a battery, a bulb and one piece of wire?,And would you be able to, kind of, draw a -- you don't have to draw,the diagram, but would you be able to draw the diagram,,if you had to do it? Or would you just say,,that's actually not possible? 
 The third question is, why is it hotter in summer than in winter?,I think we can probably agree that it is hotter in summer than in winter,,but why? And finally, would you be able to --,and you can sort of scribble it, if you like --,scribble a plan diagram of the solar system,,showing the shape of the planets' orbits?,Would you be able to do that?,And if you can, just scribble a pattern. 
 OK. Now, children get their ideas not from teachers,,as teachers often think, but actually from common sense,,from experience of the world around them,,from all the things that go on between them and their peers,,and their carers, and their parents, and all of that. Experience.,And one of the great experts in this field, of course, was, bless him,,Cardinal Wolsey. Be very careful what you get into people's heads,because it's virtually impossible to shift it afterwards, right?,(Laughter),I'm not quite sure how he died, actually.,Was he beheaded in the end, or hung?,(Laughter),Now, those questions, which, of course, you've got right,,and you haven't been conferring, and so on.,And I -- you know, normally, I would pick people out and humiliate,,but maybe not in this instance. 
 A little seed weighs a lot and, basically, all this stuff,,99 percent of this stuff, came out of the air.,Now, I guarantee that about 85 percent of you, or maybe it's fewer at TED,,will have said it comes out of the ground. And some people,,probably two of you, will come up and argue with me afterwards,,and say that actually, it comes out of the ground.,Now, if that was true, we'd have trucks going round the country,,filling people's gardens in with soil, it'd be a fantastic business.,But, actually, we don't do that.,The mass of this comes out of the air.,Now, I passed all my biology exams in Britain.,I passed them really well, but I still came out of school,thinking that that stuff came out of the ground. 
 Second one: can you light a little torch-bulb with a battery bulb and one piece of wire?,Yes, you can, and I'll show you in a second how to do that.,Now, I have some rather bad news,,which is that I had a piece of video that I was about to show you,,which unfortunately -- the sound doesn't work in this room,,so I'm going to describe to you, in true "Monty Python" fashion,,what happens in the video. And in the video, a group of researchers,go to MIT on graduation day.,We chose MIT because, obviously, that's a very long way away,from here, and you wouldn't mind too much,,but it sort of works the same way in Britain,and in the West Coast of the USA.,And we asked them these questions, and we asked those questions,of science graduates, and they couldn't answer them.,And so, there's a whole lot of people saying,,"I'd be very surprised if you told me that this came out of the air.,That's very surprising to me." And those are science graduates.,And we intercut it with, "We are the premier science university in the world,",because of British-like hubris.,(Laughter),And when we gave graduate engineers that question,,they said it couldn't be done.,And when we gave them a battery, and a piece of wire, and a bulb,,and said, "Can you do it?" They couldn't do it. Right?,And that's no different from Imperial College in London, by the way,,it's not some sort of anti-American thing going on. 
 As if. Now, the reason this matters is we pay lots and lots of money,for teaching people -- we might as well get it right.,And there are also some societal reasons,why we might want people to understand what it is that's happening,in photosynthesis. For example, one half of the carbon equation,is how much we emit, and the other half of the carbon equation,,as I'm very conscious as a trustee of Kew,,is how much things soak up, and they soak up carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.,That's what plants actually do for a living.,And, for any Finnish people in the audience, this is a Finnish pun:,we are, both literally and metaphorically, skating on thin ice,if we don't understand that kind of thing.,Now, here's how you do the battery and the bulb.,It's so easy, isn't it? Of course, you all knew that.,But if you haven't played with a battery and a bulb,,if you've only seen a circuit diagram,,you might not be able to do that, and that's one of the problems. 
 So, why is it hotter in summer than in winter?,We learn, as children, that you get closer to something that's hot,,and it burns you. It's a very powerful bit of learning,,and it happens pretty early on.,By extension, we think to ourselves, "Why it's hotter in summer than in winter,must be because we're closer to the Sun.",I promise you that most of you will have got that.,Oh, you're all shaking your heads,,but only a few of you are shaking your heads very firmly.,Other ones are kind of going like this. All right.,It's hotter in summer than in winter because the rays from the Sun,are spread out more, right, because of the tilt of the Earth.,And if you think the tilt is tilting us closer, no, it isn't.,The Sun is 93 million miles away, and we're tilting like this, right?,It makes no odds. In fact, in the Northern Hemisphere,,we're further from the Sun in summer,,as it happens, but it makes no odds, the difference. 
 OK, now, the scribble of the diagram of the solar system.,If you believe, as most of you probably do,,that it's hotter in summer than in winter because we're closer to the Sun,,you must have drawn an ellipse.,Right? That would explain it, right?,Except, in your -- you're nodding -- now, in your ellipse,,have you thought, "Well, what happens during the night?",Between Australia and here, right, they've got summer,and we've got winter, and what --,does the Earth kind of rush towards the Sun at night,,and then rush back again? I mean, it's a very strange thing going on,,and we hold these two models in our head, of what's right and what isn't right,,and we do that, as human beings, in all sorts of fields. 
 So, here's Copernicus' view of what the solar system looked like as a plan.,That's pretty much what you should have on your piece of paper. Right?,And this is NASA's view. They're stunningly similar.,I hope you notice the coincidence here.,What would you do if you knew that people had this misconception,,right, in their heads, of elliptical orbits,caused by our experiences as children?,What sort of diagram would you show them of the solar system,,to show that it's not really like that?,You'd show them something like this, wouldn't you?,It's a plan, looking down from above.,But, no, look what I found in the textbooks.,That's what you show people, right? These are from textbooks,,from websites, educational websites --,and almost anything you pick up is like that.,And the reason it's like that is because it's dead boring,to have a load of concentric circles,,whereas that's much more exciting, to look at something at that angle,,isn't it? Right? And by doing it at that angle,,if you've got that misconception in your head, then that,two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional thing will be ellipses.,So you've -- it's crap, isn't it really? As we say.,So, these mental models -- we look for evidence that reinforces our models.,We do this, of course, with matters of race, and politics, and everything else,,and we do it in science as well. So we look, just look --,and scientists do it, constantly -- we look for evidence,that reinforces our models, and some folks are just all too able,and willing to provide the evidence that reinforces the models. 
 So, being I'm in the United States, I'll have a dig at the Europeans.,These are examples of what I would say is bad practice in science,teaching centers. These pictures are from La Villette in France,and the welcome wing of the Science Museum in London.,And, if you look at the, kind of the way these things are constructed,,there's a lot of mediation by glass, and it's very blue, and kind of professional --,in that way that, you know, Woody Allen comes up,from under the sheets in that scene in "Annie Hall,",and said, "God, that's so professional." And that you don't --,there's no passion in it, and it's not hands on, right,,and, you know, pun intended. Whereas good interpretation --,I'll use an example from nearby -- is San Francisco Exploratorium,,where all the things that -- the demonstrations, and so on,,are made out of everyday objects that children can understand,,it's very hands-on, and they can engage with, and experiment with.,And I know that if the graduates at MIT,and in the Imperial College in London had had the battery and the wire,and the bit of stuff, and you know, been able to do it,,they would have learned how it actually works,,rather than thinking that they follow circuit diagrams and can't do it.,So good interpretation is more about,things that are bodged and stuffed and of my world, right?,And things that -- where there isn't an extra barrier,of a piece of glass or machined titanium,,and it all looks fantastic, OK?,And the Exploratorium does that really, really well.,And it's amateur, but amateur in the best sense,,in other words, the root of the word being of love and passion. 
 So, children are not empty vessels, OK?,So, as "Monty Python" would have it,,this is a bit Lord Privy Seal to say so,,but this is -- children are not empty vessels.,They come with their own ideas and their own theories,,and unless you work with those, then you won't be able to shift them,,right? And I probably haven't shifted your ideas,of how the world and universe operates, either.,But this applies, equally, to matters of trying to sell new technology.,For example, we are, in Britain, we're trying to do a digital switchover,of the whole population into digital technology [for television].,And it's one of the difficult things,is that when people have preconceptions of how it all works,,it's quite difficult to shift those.,So we're not empty vessels; the mental models that we have,as children persist into adulthood.,Poor teaching actually does more harm than good.,In this country and in Britain, magnetism is understood better,by children before they've been to school than afterwards, OK?,Same for gravity, two concepts, so it's -- which is quite humbling,,as a, you know, if you're a teacher, and you look before and after,,that's quite worrying. They do worse in tests afterwards, after the teaching.,And we collude. We design tests,,or at least in Britain, so that people pass them. Right?,And governments do very well. They pat themselves on the back.,OK? We collude, and actually if you --,if someone had designed a test for me,when I was doing my biology exams,,to really understand, to see whether I'd understood,more than just kind of putting starch and iodine together,and seeing it go blue,,and really understood that plants took their mass out of the air,,then I might have done better at science.,So the most important thing is to get people to articulate their models. 
 Your homework is -- you know, how does an aircraft's wing create lift?,An obvious question, and you'll have an answer now in your heads.,And the second question to that then is,,ensure you've explained how it is that planes can fly upside down.,Ah ha, right. Second question is, why is the sea blue? All right?,And you've all got an idea in your head of the answer.,So, why is it blue on cloudy days? Ah, see.,(Laughter),I've always wanted to say that in this country.,(Laughter),Finally, my plea to you is to allow yourselves, and your children,,and anyone you know, to kind of fiddle with stuff,,because it's by fiddling with things that you, you know,,you complement your other learning. It's not a replacement,,it's just part of learning that's important.,Thank you very much.,Now -- oh, oh yeah, go on then, go on.,(Applause)So the first question is, why do we need to,even worry about a pandemic threat?,What is it that we're concerned about?,When I say "we," I'm at the Council on Foreign Relations.,We're concerned in the national security community,,and of course in the biology community and the public health community.,While globalization has increased travel,,it's made it necessary that everybody be everywhere,,all the time, all over the world.,And that means that your microbial hitchhikers are moving with you.,So a plague outbreak in Surat, India,becomes not an obscure event, but a globalized event --,a globalized concern that has changed the risk equation.,Katrina showed us,that we cannot completely depend on government,to have readiness in hand, to be capable of handling things.,Indeed, an outbreak would be multiple Katrinas at once. 
 Our big concern at the moment is a virus called H5N1 flu --,some of you call it bird flu --,which first emerged in southern China, in the mid-1990s,,but we didn't know about it until 1997.,At the end of last Christmas only 13 countries had seen H5N1.,But we're now up to 55 countries in the world,,have had this virus emerge,,in either birds, or people or both.,In the bird outbreaks we now can see,that pretty much the whole world has seen this virus,except the Americas.,And I'll get into why we've so far been spared in a moment. 
 In domestic birds, especially chickens,,it's 100 percent lethal.,It's one of the most lethal things we've seen,in circulation in the world,in any recent centuries.,And we've dealt with it by killing off lots and lots and lots of chickens,,and unfortunately often not reimbursing the peasant farmers,with the result that there's cover-up.,It's also carried on migration patterns,of wild migratory aquatic birds.,There has been this centralized event,in a place called Lake Chenghai, China.,Two years ago the migrating birds,had a multiple event,where thousands died because of a mutation occurring,in the virus,,which made the species range broaden dramatically.,So that birds going to Siberia, to Europe, and to Africa,carried the virus, which had not previously been possible. 
 We're now seeing outbreaks in human populations --,so far, fortunately, small events,,tiny outbreaks, occasional clusters.,The virus has mutated dramatically in the last two years,to form two distinct families, if you will,,of the H5N1 viral tree,with branches in them,,and with different attributes that are worrying.,So what's concerning us? Well, first of all,,at no time in history have we succeeded in making,in a timely fashion, a specific vaccine,for more than 260 million people.,It's not going to do us very much good in a global pandemic.,You've heard about the vaccine we're stockpiling.,But nobody believes it will actually be particularly effective,if we have a real outbreak. 
 So one thought is:,after 9/11, when the airports closed,,our flu season was delayed by two weeks.,So the thought is, hey, maybe what we should do is just,immediately -- we hear there is H5N1 spreading from human to human,,the virus has mutated to be a human-to-human transmitter --,let's shut down the airports.,However, huge supercomputer analyses,,done of the likely effectiveness of this,,show that it won't buy us much time at all.,And of course it will be hugely disruptive in preparation plans.,For example, all masks are made in China.,How do you get them mobilized around the world,if you've shut all the airports down?,How do you get the vaccines moved around the world,and the drugs moved, and whatever may or not be available that would work.,So it turns out that shutting down the airports is counterproductive. 
 We're worried because this virus, unlike any other flu,we've ever studied, can be transmitted by eating raw meat,of the infected animals.,We've seen transmission to wild cats and domestic cats,,and now also domestic pet dogs.,And in experimental feedings to rodents and ferrets,,we found that the animals exhibit symptoms never seen with flu:,seizures, central nervous system disorders, partial paralysis.,This is not your normal garden-variety flu.,It mimics what we now understand,about reconstructing the 1918 flu virus,,the last great pandemic,,in that it also jumped directly from birds to people.,We had evolution over time,,and this unbelievable mortality rate in human beings:,55 percent of people who have become infected,with H5N1 have, in fact, succumbed.,And we don't have a huge number of people,who got infected and never developed disease. 
 In experimental feeding in monkeys,you can see that it actually downregulates,a specific immune system modulator.,The result is that what kills you,is not the virus directly, but your own immune system overreacting, saying,,"Whatever this is so foreign I'm going berserk.",The result: most of the deaths,have been in people under 30 years of age,,robustly healthy young adults.,We have seen human-to-human transmission,in at least three clusters --,fortunately involving very intimate contact,,still not putting the world at large at any kind of risk. 
 Alright, so I've got you nervous.,Now you probably assume, well the governments are going to do something.,And we have spent a lot of money.,Most of the spending in the Bush administration,has actually been more related to the anthrax results,and bio-terrorism threat.,But a lot of money has been thrown out at the local level and at the federal level,to look at infectious diseases.,End result: only 15 states,have been certified to be able to do mass distribution,of vaccine and drugs in a pandemic.,Half the states would run out of hospital beds,in the first week, maybe two weeks.,And 40 states already have an acute nursing shortage.,Add on pandemic threat, you're in big trouble. 
 So what have people been doing with this money?,Exercises, drills, all over the world.,Let's pretend there's a pandemic.,Let's everybody run around and play your role.,Main result is that there is tremendous confusion.,Most of these people don't actually know what their job will be.,And the bottom line, major thing that has come through,in every single drill: nobody knows who's in charge.,Nobody knows the chain of command.,If it were Los Angeles, is it the mayor, the governor,,the President of the United States, the head of Homeland Security?,In fact, the federal government says it's a guy called,the Principle Federal Officer,,who happens to be with TSA. 
 The government says,the federal responsibility will basically be,about trying to keep the virus out, which we all know is impossible,,and then to mitigate the impact,primarily on our economy.,The rest is up to your local community.,Everything is about your town, where you live.,Well how good a city council you have,,how good a mayor you have -- that's who's going to be in charge.,Most local facilities would all be competing,to try and get their hands on their piece,of the federal stockpile of a drug called Tamiflu,,which may or may not be helpful -- I'll get into that --,of available vaccines, and any other treatments,,and masks, and anything that's been stockpiled.,And you'll have massive competition.,Now we did purchase a vaccine, you've probably all heard about it,,made by Sanofi-Aventis.,Unfortunately it's made against the current form of H5N1.,We know the virus will mutate. It will be a different virus.,The vaccine will probably be useless.,So here's where the decisions come in. 
 You're the mayor of your local town.,Let's see, should we order that all pets be kept indoors?,Germany did that when H5N1 appeared in Germany last year,,in order to minimize the spread,between households by household cats, dogs and so on.,What do we do when we don't have any containment rooms,with reverse air that will allow the healthcare workers,to take care of patients?,These are in Hong Kong; we have nothing like that here.,What about quarantine?,During the SARS epidemic in Beijing quarantine did seem to help.,We have no uniform policies,regarding quarantine across the United States.,And some states have differential policies, county by county.,But what about the no-brainer things? Should we close all the schools?,Well then what about all the workers? They won't go to work,if their kids aren't in school.,Encouraging telecommuting? What works? 
 Well the British government did a model of telecommuting.,Six weeks they had all people in the banking industry,pretend a pandemic was underway.,What they found was, the core functions --,you know you still sort of had banks,,but you couldn't get people to put money in the ATM machines.,Nobody was processing the credit cards.,Your insurance payments didn't go through.,And basically the economy would be in a disaster state of affairs.,And that's just office workers, bankers. 
 We don't know how important hand washing is for flu --,shocking. One assumes it's a good idea to wash your hands a lot.,But actually in scientific community there is great debate,about what percentage of flu transmission between people,is from sneezing and coughing,and what percentage is on your hands.,The Institute of Medicine tried to look at the masking question.,Can we figure out a way, since we know we won't have enough masks,because we don't make them in America anymore,,they're all made in China --,do we need N95? A state-of-the-art, top-of-the-line,,must-be-fitted-to-your-face mask?,Or can we get away with some different kinds of masks?,In the SARS epidemic, we learned in Hong Kong,that most of transmission was because,people were removing their masks improperly.,And their hand got contaminated with the outside of the mask,,and then they rubbed their nose. Bingo! They got SARS.,It wasn't flying microbes.,If you go online right now, you'll get so much phony-baloney information.,You'll end up buying -- this is called an N95 mask. Ridiculous.,We don't actually have a standard,for what should be the protective gear for the first responders,,the people who will actually be there on the front lines. 
 And Tamiflu. You've probably heard of this drug,,made by Hoffmann-La Roche, patented drug.,There is some indication,that it may buy you some time in the midst of an outbreak.,Should you take Tamiflu for a long period of time,,well, one of the side effects is suicidal ideations.,A public health survey analyzed the effect,that large-scale Tamiflu use would have,,actually shows it counteractive,to public health measures, making matters worse.,And here is the other interesting thing:,when a human being ingests Tamiflu, only 20 percent,is metabolized appropriately,to be an active compound in the human being.,The rest turns into a stable compound,,which survives filtration into the water systems,,thereby exposing the very aquatic birds that would carry flu,and providing them a chance,to breed resistant strains.,And we now have seen Tamiflu-resistant strains,in both Vietnam in person-to-person transmission,,and in Egypt in person-to-person transmission.,So I personally think that our life expectancy,for Tamiflu as an effective drug,is very limited -- very limited indeed. 
 Nevertheless most of the governments,have based their whole flu policies,on building stockpiles of Tamiflu.,Russia has actually stockpiled enough,for 95 percent of all Russians.,We've stockpiled enough for 30 percent.,When I say enough, that's two weeks worth.,And then you're on your own because,the pandemic is going to last for 18 to 24 months.,Some of the poorer countries,that have had the most experience with H5N1 have built up stockpiles;,they're already expired. They are already out of date.,What do we know from 1918,,the last great pandemic?,The federal government abdicated most responsibility.,And so we ended up with this wild patchwork of regulations,all over America.,Every city, county, state did their own thing.,And the rules,and the belief systems were wildly disparate.,In some cases all schools, all churches,,all public venues were closed. 
 The pandemic circulated three times in 18 months,in the absence of commercial air travel.,The second wave was the mutated, super-killer wave.,And in the first wave we had enough healthcare workers.,But by the time the second wave hit,it took such a toll among the healthcare workers,that we lost most of our doctors and nurses that were on the front lines.,Overall we lost 700,000 people.,The virus was 100 percent lethal to pregnant women,and we don't actually know why.,Most of the death toll was 15 to 40 year-olds --,robustly healthy young adults.,It was likened to the plague.,We don't actually know how many people died.,The low-ball estimate is 35 million.,This was based on European and North American data. 
 A new study by Chris Murray at Harvard,shows that if you look at the databases that were kept,by the Brits in India,,there was a 31-fold greater death rate among the Indians.,So there is a strong belief that in places of poverty,the death toll was far higher.,And that a more likely toll,is somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 to 100 million people,before we had commercial air travel.,So are we ready?,As a nation, no we're not.,And I think even those in the leadership,would say that is the case,,that we still have a long ways to go. 
 So what does that mean for you? Well the first thing is,,I wouldn't start building up personal stockpiles of anything --,for yourself, your family, or your employees --,unless you've really done your homework.,What mask works, what mask doesn't work.,How many masks do you need?,The Institute of Medicine study felt that,you could not recycle masks.,Well if you think it's going to last 18 months,,are you going to buy 18 months worth of masks,for every single person in your family? 
 We don't know -- again with Tamiflu,,the number one side effect of Tamiflu is,flu-like symptoms.,So then how can you tell,who in your family has the flu,if everybody is taking Tamiflu?,If you expand that out to think of a whole community,,or all your employees in your company,,you begin to realize how limited,the Tamiflu option might be.,Everybody has come up to me and said,,well I'll stockpile water or, I'll stockpile food, or what have you.,But really? Do you really have a place,to stockpile 18 months worth of food? Twenty-four months worth of food?,Do you want to view the pandemic threat,the way back in the 1950s,people viewed the civil defense issue,,and build your own little bomb shelter for pandemic flu?,I don't think that's rational. 
 I think it's about having to be prepared,as communities, not as individuals --,being prepared as nation,,being prepared as state, being prepared as town.,And right now most of the preparedness,is deeply flawed.,And I hope I've convinced you of that,,which means that the real job is go out and,say to your local leaders,,and your national leaders,,"Why haven't you solved these problems?,Why are you still thinking that,the lessons of Katrina do not apply to flu?",And put the pressure where the pressure needs to be put.,But I guess the other thing to add is,,if you do have employees, and you do have a company,,I think you have certain responsibilities,to demonstrate that you are thinking ahead for them,,and you are trying to plan.,At a minimum the British banking plan showed that,telecommuting can be helpful.,It probably does reduce exposure,because people are not coming into the office and coughing on each other,,or touching common objects,and sharing things via their hands.,But can you sustain your company that way?,Well if you have a dot-com, maybe you can.,Otherwise you're in trouble.,Happy to take your questions.,(Applause) 
 Audience member: What factors determine the duration of a pandemic? 
 Laurie Garret: What factors determine the duration of a pandemic, we don't really know.,I could give you a bunch of flip, this, that, and the other.,But I would say that honestly we don't know.,Clearly the bottom line is,the virus eventually attenuates,,and ceases to be a lethal virus to humanity,,and finds other hosts.,But we don't really know how and why that happens.,It's a very complicated ecology. 
 Audience member: What kind of triggers are you looking for?,You know way more than any of us.,To say ahh, if this happens then we are going to have a pandemic? 
 LG: The moment that you see any evidence,of serious human-to-human to transmission.,Not just intimately between family members,who took care of an ailing sister or brother,,but a community infected --,spread within a school,,spread within a dormitory, something of that nature.,Then I think that there is universal agreement,now, at WHO all the way down:,Send out the alert. 
 Audience member: Some research has indicated that statins can be helpful.,Can you talk about that? 
 LG: Yeah. There is some evidence that taking Lipitor,and other common statins for cholesterol control,may decrease your vulnerability,to influenza.,But we do not completely understand why.,The mechanism isn't clear.,And I don't know that there is any way,responsibly for someone to start,medicating their children,with their personal supply of Lipitor or something of that nature.,We have absolutely no idea what that would do.,You might be causing some very dangerous outcomes,in your children, doing such a thing. 
 Audience member: How far along are we in being able to determine,whether someone is actually carrying, whether somebody has this,before the symptoms are full-blown? 
 LG: Right. So I have for a long time said,that what we really needed was a rapid diagnostic.,And our Centers for Disease Control,has labeled a test they developed,a rapid diagnostic.,It takes 24 hours in a very highly developed laboratory,,in highly skilled hands.,I'm thinking dipstick.,You could do it to your own kid. It changes color.,It tells you if you have H5N1.,In terms of where we are in science,with DNA identification capacities and so on,,it's not that far off.,But we're not there. And there hasn't been the kind of investment to get us there. 
 Audience member: In the 1918 flu I understand that,they theorized that there was some attenuation,of the virus when it made the leap into humans.,Is that likely, do you think, here?,I mean 100 percent death rate,is pretty severe. 
 LG: Um yeah. So we don't actually know,what the lethality was,of the 1918 strain to wild birds,before it jumped from birds to humans.,It's curious that there is no evidence,of mass die-offs of chickens,or household birds across America,before the human pandemic happened.,That may be because those events,were occurring on the other side of the world,where nobody was paying attention.,But the virus clearly,went through one round around the world,in a mild enough form,that the British army in World War I,actually certified that it was not a threat,and would not affect the outcome of the war.,And after circulating around the world,came back in a form that was tremendously lethal.,What percentage of infected people were killed by it?,Again we don't really know for sure.,It's clear that if you were malnourished to begin with,,you had a weakened immune system,,you lived in poverty in India or Africa,,your likelihood of dying was far greater.,But we don't really know. 
 Audience member: One of the things I've heard is that,the real death cause when you get a flu is the associated pneumonia,,and that a pneumonia vaccine,may offer you 50 percent better chance of survival. 
 LG: For a long time, researchers in emerging diseases,were kind of dismissive of the pandemic flu threat,on the grounds that,back in 1918 they didn't have antibiotics.,And that most people who die of regular flu --,which in regular flu years,is about 360,000 people worldwide,,most of them senior citizens --,and they die not of the flu but because the flu gives an assault to their immune system.,And along comes pneumococcus,or another bacteria, streptococcus,and boom, they get a bacterial pneumonia.,But it turns out that in 1918 that was not the case at all.,And so far in the H5N1 cases in people,,similarly bacterial infection,has not been an issue at all.,It's this absolutely phenomenal disruption of the immune system,that is the key to why people die of this virus. 
 And I would just add,we saw the same thing with SARS.,So what's going on here is your body says,,your immune system sends out all its sentinels and says,,"I don't know what the heck this is.,We've never seen anything even remotely like this before.",It won't do any good to bring in the sharpshooters,because those antibodies aren't here.,And it won't do any good to bring in the tanks and the artillery,because those T-cells don't recognize it either.,So we're going to have to go all-out thermonuclear response,,stimulate the total cytokine cascade.,The whole immune system swarms into the lungs.,And yes they die, drowning in their own fluids, of pneumonia.,But it's not bacterial pneumonia.,And it's not a pneumonia that would respond to a vaccine.,And I think my time is up. I thank you all for your attention.,(Applause)I have a tough job to do.,You know, when I looked at the profile of the audience here,,with their connotations and design, in all its forms,,and with so much and so many people working,on collaborative and networks, and so on, that I wanted to tell you,,I wanted to build an argument for primary education,in a very specific context.,In order to do that in 20 minutes, I have to bring out four ideas --,it's like four pieces of a puzzle.,And if I succeed in doing that,,maybe you would go back with the thought,that you could build on, and perhaps help me do my work. 
 The first piece of the puzzle is remoteness,and the quality of education.,Now, by remoteness, I mean two or three different kinds of things.,Of course, remoteness in its normal sense, which means,that as you go further and further away,from an urban center, you get to remoter areas.,What happens to education?,The second, or a different kind of remoteness,is that within the large metropolitan areas all over the world,,you have pockets, like slums, or shantytowns, or poorer areas,,which are socially and economically remote,from the rest of the city, so it's us and them.,What happens to education in that context?,So keep both of those ideas of remoteness. 
 We made a guess. The guess was that schools in remote areas,do not have good enough teachers.,If they do have, they cannot retain those teachers.,They do not have good enough infrastructure.,And if they had some infrastructure,,they have difficulty maintaining it.,But I wanted to check if this is true. So what I did last year was,we hired a car, looked up on Google,,found a route into northern India from New Delhi,which, you know, which did not cross any big cities,or any big metropolitan centers. Drove out about 300 kilometers,,and wherever we found a school, administered a set of standard tests,,and then took those test results and plotted them on a graph.,The graph was interesting, although you need to consider it carefully.,I mean, this is a very small sample; you should not generalize from it.,But it was quite obvious, quite clear,,that for this particular route that I had taken,,the remoter the school was, the worse its results seemed to be.,That seemed a little damning,,and I tried to correlate it with things like infrastructure,,or with the availability of electricity, and things like that. 
 To my surprise, it did not correlate.,It did not correlate with the size of classrooms.,It did not correlate with the quality of the infrastructure.,It did not correlate with the poverty levels. It did not correlate.,But what happened was that when I administered a questionnaire,to each of these schools, with one single question for the teachers -- which was,,"Would you like to move to an urban, metropolitan area?" --,69 percent of them said yes. And as you can see from that,,they say yes just a little bit out of Delhi,,and they say no when you hit the rich suburbs of Delhi --,because, you know, those are relatively better off areas --,and then from 200 kilometers out of Delhi, the answer is consistently yes.,I would imagine that a teacher who comes or walks into class,every day thinking that, I wish I was in some other school,,probably has a deep impact on what happens to the results.,So it looked as though teacher motivation and teacher migration,was a powerfully correlated thing with what was happening in primary schools,,as opposed to whether the children have enough to eat,,and whether they are packed tightly into classrooms,and that sort of thing. It appears that way. 
 When you take education and technology, then I find in the literature that,,you know, things like websites, collaborative environments --,you've been listening to all that in the morning --,it's always piloted first in the best schools, the best urban schools,,and, according to me, biases the result.,The literature -- one part of it, the scientific literature --,consistently blames ET as being over-hyped and under-performing.,The teachers always say, well, it's fine, but it's too expensive for what it does.,Because it's being piloted in a school where the students are already getting,,let's say, 80 percent of whatever they could do.,You put in this new super-duper technology, and now they get 83 percent.,So the principal looks at it and says,,3 percent for 300,000 dollars? Forget it.,If you took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools,,where the score was 30 percent, and, let's say, took that up to 40 percent --,that will be a completely different thing.,So the relative change that ET, Educational Technology, would make,,would be far greater at the bottom of the pyramid than at the top,,but we seem to be doing it the other way about. 
 So I came to this conclusion that ET should reach,the underprivileged first, not the other way about.,And finally came the question of, how do you tackle teacher perception?,Whenever you go to a teacher and show them some technology,,the teacher's first reaction is,,you cannot replace a teacher with a machine -- it's impossible.,I don't know why it's impossible, but, even for a moment,,if you did assume that it's impossible -- I have a quotation from Sir Arthur C. Clarke,,the science fiction writer whom I met in Colombo,,and he said something which completely solves this problem.,He said a teacher than can be replaced by a machine, should be.,So, you know, it puts the teacher into a tough bind, you have to think.,Anyway, so I'm proposing that an alternative primary education,,whatever alternative you want, is required where schools don't exist,,where schools are not good enough, where teachers are not available,or where teachers are not good enough, for whatever reason.,If you happen to live in a part of the world where none of this applies,,then you don't need an alternative education.,So far I haven't come across such an area, except for one case. I won't name the area,,but somewhere in the world people said, we don't have this problem,,because we have perfect teachers and perfect schools.,There are such areas, but -- anyway, I'd never heard that anywhere else. 
 I'm going to talk about children and self-organization,,and a set of experiments which sort of led to this idea,of what might an alternative education be like.,They're called the hole-in-the-wall experiments.,I'll have to really rush through this. They're a set of experiments.,The first one was done in New Delhi in 1999.,And what we did over there was pretty much simple.,I had an office in those days which bordered a slum, an urban slum,,so there was a dividing wall between our office and the urban slum.,They cut a hole inside that wall --,which is how it has got the name hole-in-the-wall --,and put a pretty powerful PC into that hole, sort of embedded into the wall,so that its monitor was sticking out at the other end,,a touchpad similarly embedded into the wall,,put it on high-speed Internet, put the Internet Explorer there,,put it on Altavista.com -- in those days -- and just left it there. 
 And this is what we saw.,So that was my office in IIT. Here's the hole-in-the-wall.,About eight hours later, we found this kid.,To the right is this eight-year-old child who --,and to his left is a six-year-old girl, who is not very tall.,And what he was doing was, he was teaching her to browse.,So it sort of raised more questions than it answered.,Is this real? Does the language matter,,because he's not supposed to know English?,Will the computer last, or will they break it and steal it,-- and did anyone teach them?,The last question is what everybody said, but you know,,I mean, they must have poked their head over the wall,and asked the people in your office,,can you show me how to do it, and then somebody taught him. 
 So I took the experiment out of Delhi and repeated it,,this time in a city called Shivpuri in the center of India,,where I was assured that nobody had ever taught anybody anything.,(Laughter),So it was a warm day, and the hole in the wall,was on that decrepit old building. This is the first kid who came there;,he later on turned out to be a 13-year-old school dropout.,He came there and he started to fiddle around with the touchpad.,Very quickly, he noticed that when he moves his finger on the touchpad,something moves on the screen --,and later on he told me, "I have never seen a television,where you can do something.",So he figured that out. It took him over two minutes,to figure out that he was doing things to the television.,And then, as he was doing that, he made an accidental click,by hitting the touchpad -- you'll see him do that.,He did that, and the Internet Explorer changed page.,Eight minutes later, he looked from his hand to the screen,,and he was browsing: he was going back and forth.,When that happened, he started calling all the neighborhood children,,like, children would come and see what's happening over here.,And by the evening of that day, 70 children were all browsing.,So eight minutes and an embedded computer,seemed to be all that we needed there. 
 So we thought that this is what was happening:,that children in groups can self-instruct themselves,to use a computer and the Internet. But under what circumstances?,At this time there was a -- the main question was about English.,People said, you know, you really ought to have this in Indian languages.,So I said, have what, shall I translate the Internet,into some Indian language? That's not possible.,So, it has to be the other way about.,But let's see, how do the children tackle the English language?,I took the experiment out to northeastern India,,to a village called Madantusi,,where, for some reason, there was no English teacher,,so the children had not learned English at all.,And I built a similar hole-in-the-wall.,One big difference in the villages, as opposed to the urban slums:,there were more girls than boys who came to the kiosk.,In the urban slums, the girls tend to stay away.,I left the computer there with lots of CDs -- I didn't have any Internet --,and came back three months later.,So when I came back there, I found these two kids,,eight- and 12-year-olds, who were playing a game on the computer.,And as soon as they saw me they said,,"We need a faster processor and a better mouse.",(Laughter),I was real surprised.,You know, how on earth did they know all this?,And they said, "Well, we've picked it up from the CDs.",So I said, "But how did you understand what's going on over there?",So they said, "Well, you've left this machine,which talks only in English, so we had to learn English.",So then I measured, and they were using 200 English words with each other,-- mispronounced, but correct usage --,words like exit, stop, find, save, that kind of thing,,not only to do with the computer but in their day-to-day conversations.,So, Madantusi seemed to show that language is not a barrier;,in fact they may be able to teach themselves the language,if they really wanted to. 
 Finally, I got some funding to try this experiment out,to see if these results are replicable, if they happen everywhere else.,India is a good place to do such an experiment in,,because we have all the ethnic diversities, all the -- you know,,the genetic diversity, all the racial diversities,,and also all the socio-economic diversities.,So, I could actually choose samples to cover a cross section,that would cover practically the whole world.,So I did this for almost five years, and this experiment,really took us all the way across the length and breadth of India.,This is the Himalayas. Up in the north, very cold.,I also had to check or invent an engineering design,which would survive outdoors, and I was using regular, normal PCs,,so I needed different climates, for which India is also great,,because we have very cold, very hot, and so on.,This is the desert to the west. Near the Pakistan border.,And you see here a little clip of -- one of these villages --,the first thing that these children did was to find a website,to teach themselves the English alphabet. 
 Then to central India -- very warm, moist, fishing villages,,where humidity is a very big killer of electronics.,So we had to solve all the problems we had,without air conditioning and with very poor power,,so most of the solutions that came out used little blasts of air,put at the right places to keep the machines running.,I want to just cut this short. We did this over and over again.,This sequence is also nice. This is a small child, a six-year-old,,telling his eldest sister what to do.,And this happens very often with these computers,,that the younger children are found teaching the older ones. 
 What did we find? We found that six- to 13-year-olds can self-instruct,in a connected environment,,irrespective of anything that we could measure.,So if they have access to the computer, they will teach themselves, including intelligence.,I couldn't find a single correlation with anything, but it had to be in groups.,And that may be of great, you know, interest to this group,,because all of you are talking about groups.,So here was the power of what a group of children can do,,if you lift the adult intervention. 
 Just a quick idea of the measurements.,We took standard statistical techniques, so I'm going to not talk about that.,But we got a clean learning curve,,almost exactly the same as what you would get in a school.,I'll leave it at that,,because, I mean, it sort of says it all, doesn't it?,What could they learn to do?,Basic Windows functions, browsing, painting, chatting and email,,games and educational material, music downloads, playing video.,In short, what all of us do.,And over 300 children will become computer literate,and be able to do all of these things in six months with one computer. 
 So, how do they do that?,If you calculated the actual time of access,,it would work out to minutes per day,,so that's not how it's happening.,What you have, actually, is there is one child operating the computer.,And surrounding him are usually three other children,,who are advising him on what they should do.,If you test them, all four will get the same scores in whatever you ask them.,Around these four are usually a group of about 16 children,,who are also advising, usually wrongly,,about everything that's going on on the computer.,And all of them also will clear a test given on that subject.,So they are learning as much by watching as they learn by doing.,It seems counter-intuitive to adult learning,,but remember, eight-year-olds live in a society,where most of the time they are told, don't do this,,you know, don't touch the whiskey bottle.,So what does the eight-year-old do?,He observes very carefully how a whiskey bottle should be touched.,And if you tested him,,he would answer every question correctly on that topic.,So, they seem to be able to acquire very quickly. 
 So what was the conclusion over the six years of work?,It was that primary education can happen on its own,,or parts of it can happen on its own.,It does not have to be imposed from the top downwards.,It could perhaps be a self-organizing system, so that was,the second bit that I wanted to tell you,,that children can self-organize and attain an educational objective. 
 The third piece was on values, and again, to put it very briefly,,I conducted a test over 500 children spread across all over India,,and asked them -- I gave them about 68 different,values-oriented questions and simply asked them their opinions.,We got all sorts of opinions. Yes, no or I don't know.,I simply took those questions where I got 50 percent yeses and 50 percent noes --,so I was able to get a collection of 16 such statements.,These were areas where the children were clearly confused,,because half said yes and half said no.,A typical example being, "Sometimes it is necessary to tell lies.",They don't have a way to determine which way to answer this question;,perhaps none of us do.,So I leave you with this third question.,Can technology alter the acquisition of values?,Finally, self-organizing systems,,about which, again, I won't say too much,because you've been hearing all about it.,Natural systems are all self-organizing:,galaxies, molecules, cells, organisms, societies --,except for the debate about an intelligent designer.,But at this point in time, as far as science goes,,it's self-organization.,But other examples are traffic jams, stock market, society,and disaster recovery, terrorism and insurgency.,And you know about the Internet-based self-organizing systems. 
 So here are my four sentences then.,Remoteness affects the quality of education.,Educational technology should be introduced into remote areas first,,and other areas later.,Values are acquired; doctrine and dogma are imposed --,the two opposing mechanisms.,And learning is most likely a self-organizing system.,If you put all the four together, then it gives -- according to me --,it gives us a goal, a vision, for educational technology.,An educational technology and pedagogy that is digital, automatic,,fault-tolerant, minimally invasive, connected and self-organized.,As educationists, we have never asked for technology; we keep borrowing it.,PowerPoint is supposed to be considered a great educational technology,,but it was not meant for education, it was meant for making boardroom presentations.,We borrowed it. Video conferencing. The personal computer itself.,I think it's time that the educationists made their own specs,,and I have such a set of specs. This is a brief look at that.,And such a set of specs should produce the technology,to address remoteness, values and violence.,So I thought I'd give it a name -- why don't we call it "outdoctrination.",And could this be a goal for educational technology in the future?,So I want to leave that as a thought with you. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Charles and Ray were a team. They were husband and wife.,Despite the New York Times' and Vanity Fair's best efforts recently,,they're not brothers. (Laughter),And they were a lot of fun.,You know, Ray was the one who wore the ampersands in the family.,(Laughter) 
 We are going to focus on Charles today, because it is Charles' 100th birthday.,But when I speak of him, I'm really speaking of both of them as a team.,Here's Charles when he was three. So he would be 100 this June.,We have a lot of cool celebrations that we're going to do.,The thing about their work,is that most people come to the door of furniture --,I suspect you probably recognize this chair,and some of the others I'm going to show you.,But we're going to first enter through the door of the Big Top.,The whole thing about this, though, is that, you know, why am I showing it?,Is it because Charles and Ray made this film?,This is actually a training film for a clown college that they had.,They also practiced a clown act when the future of furniture,was not nearly as auspicious as it turned out to be.,There is a picture of Charles. So let's watch the next clip. 
 The film that we're about to see is a film they made for the Moscow World's Fair. 
 Video: This is the land.,It has many contrasts.,It is rough and it is flat.,In places it is cold.,In some it is hot.,Too much rain falls on some areas,,and not enough on others.,But people live on this land.,And, as in Russia,,they are drawn together into towns and cities.,Here is something of the way they live. 
 Eames Demetrios: Now, this is a film that was hardly ever seen in the United States.,It was on seven screens and it was 200 feet across.,And it was at the height of the Cold War.,The Nixon-Khrushchev Kitchen Debate,happened about 50 feet from where this was shown.,And yet, how did it start?,You know, commonality, the first line,in Charles' narration was,,"The same stars that shine down on Russia,shine down on the United States. From the sky,,our cities look much the same.",It was that human connection that Charles and Ray always found in everything.,And you can imagine, and the thing about it is,,that they believed that the human mind could handle this number of images,because the important thing was to get the gestalt,of what the images were about. 
 So that was just a little snip.,But the thing about Charles and Ray,is that they were always modeling stuff.,They were always trying things out.,I think one of the things I am passionate about, my grandparents work,,I'm passionate about my work,,but on top of all that I'm passionate,about a holistic vision of design,,where design is a life skill, not a professional skill.,And you know, those of us with kids often want our kids to take music.,I'm no exception.,But it's not about them becoming Bono or Tracy Chapman.,It's about getting that music thing going through their heads and their thinking. 
 Design is the same way. Design has to become that same way.,And this is a model that they did of that seven-screen presentation.,And Charles just checking it out there.,So now we're going to go through that door of furniture.,This is an unusual installation of airport seating.,So what we're going to see is some of the icons of Eames furniture. 
 And the thing about their furniture is that they said the role of the designer,was essentially that of a good host,,anticipating the needs of the guest.,So those are cool images. But these are ones I think are really cool.,These are all the prototypes. These are the mistakes,,although I don't think mistakes is the right word in design.,It's just the things you try out,to kind of make it work better.,And you know some of them would probably be terrible chairs.,Some of them are kind of cool looking. It's like "Hey, why didn't they try that?",It was that hands-on iterative process,which is so much like vernacular design,and folk design in traditional cultures. 
 And I think that's one of the commonalities between modernism,and traditional design. I think it may be a real common ground,as we kind of figure out what on earth to do in the next 20 or 30 years.,The other thing that's kind of cool is that,you look at this and in the media when people say design,,they actually mean style.,And I'm really here to talk about design.,But you know the object is just a pivot.,It's a pivot between a process and a system. 
 And this is a little film I made,about the making of the Eames lounge chair.,The design process for Charles and Ray,never ended in manufacturing.,It continued. They were always trying to make thing better and better.,Because it's like as Bill Clinton was saying about Rwandan health clinics.,It's not enough to create one.,You've got to create a system that will work better and better.,So I've always liked this prototype picture.,Because it just kind of, you know, doesn't get any more basic than that.,You try things out. 
 This is a relatively famous chair.,Its early version had an "X" base. That's what the collectors like.,Charles and Ray liked this one because it was better.,It worked better: "H" base, much more practical.,This is something called a splint.,And I was very touched by Dean Kamen's,work for the military, or for the soldiers,,because Charles and Ray designed a molded plywood splint. This is it.,And they'd been working on furniture before.,But doing these splints they learned a lot about the manufacturing process,,which was incredibly important to them. 
 I'm trying to show you too much,,because I want you to really get a broth of ideas and images.,This is a house that Charles and Ray designed.,My sister is chasing someone else. It's not me.,Although I endorse heartily the fact that he stole her diary, it's not me.,And then this is a film, on the lower left, that Charles and Ray made.,Now look at that plastic chair.,The house is 1949.,The chair is done in 1949. 
 Charles and Ray,,they didn't obsess about style for it's own sake.,They didn't say, "Our style is curves. Let's make the house curvy.",They didn't say, "Our style is grids. Let's make the chair griddy.",They focused on the need.,They tried to solve the design problem.,Charles used to say, "The extent to which you have a design style,is the extent to which you have not solved the design problem.",It's kind of a brutal quote.,This is the earlier design of that house.,And again, they managed to figure out a way to make a prototype,of a house -- architecture, very expensive medium. 
 Here's a film we've been hearing things about.,The "Powers of Ten" is a film they made.,If we watch the next clip,,you're going to see the first version of "Powers of Ten," upper left.,The familiar one on the lower right.,The Eames' film Tops, lower left.,And a lamp that Charles designed for a church. 
 Video: Which in turn belongs to a local group of galaxies.,These form part of a grouping system,much as the stars do.,They are so many and so varied that from this distance,they appear like the stars from Earth. 
 ED: You've seen that film, and what's so great about this,whole conference is that everybody has been talking about scale.,Everybody here is coming at it from a different way.,I want to give you one example.,E.O. Wilson once told me that when he looked at ants --,he loved them, of course, and he wanted to learn more about them --,he consciously looked at them from the standpoint of scale.,So here is the tiny creature.,And yet simply by changing the frame of reference,it reveals so much, including what ended up being the TED Prize. 
 Modeling, they tried modeling all the time. They were always modeling things.,And I think part of that is that they never delegated understanding.,And I think in our family we were very lucky,,because we learned about design backwards.,Design was not something other.,It was part of the business of life in general.,It was part of the quality of life.,And here is some family pictures.,And you can see why I'm down on style, with a haircut like that.,But anyway, (Laughter),I remember the cut grapefruit that we would have at the Eames house when I was a kid.,So we're going to watch another film. 
 This is a film, the one called Toys.,You can see me, I have the same haircut, in the upper right corner.,Upper left is a film they did on toy trains.,Lower right is a solar do-nothing toy.,Lower left is Day-of-the-Dead toys.,Charles used to say that toys are not as innocent as they appear.,They are often the precursor to bigger things.,And these ideas -- that train up there, being about the honest use of materials,,is totally the same,as the honest use of materials in the plywood. 
 And now I'm going to test you.,This is a letter that my grandfather sent to my mom when she was five years old.,So can you read it?,Lucia angel,,okay, eye. 
 Audience: Saw many trains. 
 ED: Awl, also, good that the leather crafter's guild is here.,Also, what is he doing? Row, rowed.,Sun? No. Well is there another name for a sunrise?,Dawn, very good.,Also rode on one. I ... 
 Audience: You had, I hope you had -- 
 ED: Now you've been to the website Dogs of Saint Louis,in the late, in the mid-1930's,,then you'd know that was a Great Dane.,So, I hope you had a 
 Audience: Nice time, time -- 
 ED: Time at.,Citizen Kane, rose -- 
 Audience: Rosebud. 
 ED: No, bud. "D"'s right. At Buddy's -- 
 Audience: Party. Love. 
 ED: Okay, good.,So, "I saw many trains and also rode on one.,I hope you had a nice time at Buddy's party.",So you guys did pretty good, cool.,So my mom and Charles had this great relationship,where they'd send those sorts of things back and forth to one another.,And it's all part of the, you know,,they used to say, "Take your pleasure seriously." 
 These are some images from a project of mine,that's called Kymaerica.,It's sort of an alternative universe.,It's kind of a reinterpretation of the landscape.,Those plaques are plaques we've been installing around North America.,We're about to do six in the U.K. next week.,And they honor events in the linear world from the fictional world.,So, of course, since it's bronze it has to be true. 
 Video: Kymaerica with waterfalls,,tumbling through our -- 
 ED: This is one of the traditional Kymaerican songs.,And so we had spelling bees in Paris, Illinois. 
 Video: Your word is N. Carolina. 
 Girl: Y-I-N-D-I-A-N-A. 
 ED: And then Embassy Row is actually a historical site,,because in the Kymaerican story,this is where the Parisian Diaspora started, where there embassy was.,So you can actually visit and have this three-dimensional,fictional experience there.,And the town has really embraced it.,We had the spelling bee in conjunction with the Gwomeus Club. 
 But what is really cool is that we take our visual environment,as inevitable. And it's not.,Other things could have happened. The Japanese could have discovered Monterey.,And we could have been born 100,000 years ago.,And there are a lot of fun things. This is the Museum of the Bench.,They have trading cards,and all sorts of cool things.,And you're kind of trapped in the texture of Kymaerica.,The Tahatchabe, the great road building culture.,A guy named Nobu Naga,,the so-called Japanese Columbus.,But now I'm going to return you to the real world. 
 And this is Cranbrook. I've got a real treat for you,,which is the first film that Charles ever made.,So let's watch that. Nobody's ever seen it.,Cranbrook is very generous to let us show it for the first time here.,It's a film about Maya Gretel, a famous ceramicist, and a teacher at Cranbrook.,And he made it for the 1939 faculty exhibition.,Silent. We don't have a track for it yet.,Very simple. It's just a start. But it's that learn-by-doing thing.,You want to learn how to make films? Go make a movie.,And you try something out. 
 But here is what's really great.,See that chair there? The orange one? That's the organic chair. 1940.,At the same time that Charles was doing that chair,,he was doing this film.,So my point is that this scope of vision, this holistic vision,of design, was with them from the beginning.,It wasn't like "Oh, we made some chairs and got successful.,Now we're going to do some movies.",It was always part of how they looked at the world. And that's what's really powerful.,And I think that all of us in this room, as you move design forward,,it's not about just doing one thing.,It's about how you approach problems. And there is this huge, beautiful commonality,between design, business and the world.,So we're going to do the last clip.,And I've shown you some of the images. I just want to focus on sound now.,So this is Charles' voice. 
 Charles Eames: In India, those without, and the lowest in caste,,eat very often, particularly in southern India,,they eat off of a banana leaf.,And those a little bit up the scale,eat off of a sort of a low-fired ceramic dish.,And a little bit higher, why they have a glaze,on a thing they call a thali.,If you're up the scale a little bit more,,why, a brass thali.,And then things get to be a little questionable.,There are things like silver-plated thalis.,And there is solid silver thalis.,And I suppose some nut has had a,gold thali that he's eaten off of. 
 But you can go beyond that.,And the guys that have not only means,,but a certain amount of knowledge and understanding,,go to the next step, and they eat off a banana leaf.,And I think that in these times,when we fall back and regroup,,that somehow or other,,the banana leaf parable,sort of got to get working there,,because I'm not prepared to say,that the banana leaf that one eats off of,is the same as the other eats off of.,But it is that process that has happened within the man,that changes the banana leaf. 
 ED: I've been looking forward to sharing that quote with you.,Because that's part of where we've got to get to.,And I also want to share this one.,"Beyond the age of information is the age of choices.",And I really think that's where we are.,And it's kind of cool for me to be part of a family,and a tradition where he was talking about that in 1978.,And part of why this stuff is important,and all the things that we do are important,,is that these are the ideas we need.,And I think that this is all part of surrendering to the design journey.,That's what we all need to do.,Design is not just for designers anymore. It's a process. It's not style.,All that great thinking needs to really get about solving,pretty key problems.,I really thank you for your time.,(Applause)Good morning.,My name is David Rose.,I am a serial entrepreneurnturned serial investor.,And by the use of pitchingnPowerPoints to VCs,,I have personally raisedntens of millions of dollars,from VCs through PowerPoint pitches.,And turning to the other sidenof the equation,,I've personally supervised the investmentnof tens of millions of dollars,into companies who have pitched menwith PowerPoint presentations.,So I think it's safe to say,I know a little bitnabout the process of pitching. 
 So, the very first questionnyou've got to figure out is:,What is the single most importantnthing that a VC is looking for,when you come to themnpitching your new business idea?,There are obviously all kinds of things --,business models and financialsnand markets and this and that.,Overall, of all the thingsnthat you have to do,,what is the single most important thing,the VC is going to be investing in?,Somebody? What? 
 Audience: People! 
 David Rose: People! You!nThat's it -- you are the person.,Therefore, the entire purposenof a VC pitch is to convince them,that you are the entrepreneur in whomnthey are going to invest their money,and make a lot of money in return. 
 Now, how do you do this?,You can't just walk up and say,,"Hi, I'm a really good guy, good girl,nand you should invest in me." Right?,So in the course of your VC pitch --nyou have a very few minutes;,most VC pitches, angel pitches,nare about 15 minutes,,most should be less than half an hour --,people's attention span,nafter 18 minutes, begins to drop off.,Tests have shown.,So in that 18 or 10 or five minutes,,you have to convey a whole bunchnof different characteristics,,about 10 different characteristics,,while you're standing up there.,What's the single most important thingnyou've got to convey? What? 
 Audience: Integrity. 
 DR: Boy, oh boy, oh boy!,That's a straight line, look at that!,And I didn't even prompt him.,Right, integrity. The key thing.,I would much rather invest in,ntake a chance on,,somebody who I know is straightnthan where there's any possible question,of who are they looking out for,nand what's going on.,So the most important thing is integrity.,What's the second most important thing?,Let's see if you can get this one. 
 Audience: Self-confidence. 
 DR: Close enough. Passion.,Right? Entrepreneurs, by definition,nare people who are leaving something else,,starting a new world, creating and puttingntheir lifeblood into this thing.,You've got to convey passion.,If you're not passionate,,why should anyone else be,nor put money into your company,if you're not passionate about it?,Integrity, passion:nthe most important things. 
 Then there's a whole panoplynof other things you've got to wrap up,in this package you're presenting to a VC.,Experience: you've got to be able to say,,"Hey, you know, I've done this before.","Done this before" is startingnan enterprise, creating value,,and taking somethingnfrom beginning to end.,That's why VCs love to fundnserial entrepreneurs --,even if you didn't do it rightnthe first time,,you've learned the lessons, which putsnyou in good stead the next time. 
 Along with the experience of startingnan enterprise or running something --,doesn't have to be a business,,it can be an organizationnin a school, a not-for-profit.,But experiencenin creating an organization. 
 Next: knowledge.,If you tell me,you're going to be the developernof the map of the human genome,,you better know what a human genome is;nI want you to have expertise.,I don't want somebody who says,,"I've got a great ideanin a business I know nothing about.,I don't know who the players are,nwhat the market is like.",You've got to know your market, your area. 
 And you have to haventhe skills that it takes,to get a company going.,Those skills includeneverything from technical skills,if it's a technology business,,to marketing and salesnand management and so on.,But, you know, not everybodynhas all these skills.,Very few people have the full setnof skills it takes to run a company. 
 What else do you require?nWell, leadership.,You've got to be able to convince usnthat you either have developed a team,that has all those factorsnin it, or else you can.,And you have the charismanand the management style,and the ability to get peoplento follow your lead,,to inspire them, to motivate themnto be part of your team. 
 Having done all that,,what else do I want to know as a VC?,I want to know that you have commitment.,That you are going to be here to the end.,I want you to say --nor I want you to convey --,that you are going to die if younhave to, with your very last breath,,your fingernails scratchingnas they draw you out.,You'll keep my money alivenand make more from it.,I don't want someone who'llncut and run at the first opportunity.,Bad things happen.,There's never been a venture-fundedncompany where bad things didn't happen.,So know that you're committednto the very end. 
 You've got to have visionnto see where this is going.,I don't want another "me too" product.,I want somebody who cannchange the world out there.,But on top of that, I need realism,,Because while changing the worldnis great, it doesn't always happen.,And before you get to change the world,,bad things are going to take place;,you have to deal with that.,And you have to have rational projections. 
 Finally, you're asking for my money --,not just because it's my money,nbut because it's me.,You need to be coachable.,I need to knownyou have the ability to listen.,We've had a lot of experience.,People who are VCs or angelsninvesting in you have had experience,,and they'd like to know that younwant to hear that experience. 
 So how do you convey these 10 thingsnin 10 minutes without saying them?,You can't say, "I've gotnintegrity, invest in me!",You've got to do a whole pitchnthat conveys this without conveying it.,Think about your pitch as a timeline.,It starts off, you walk in the door.,They know nothing whatsoever about you.,You can take them on an emotional --nall pitches, all sales presentations,,are emotional at some level.,You can go up, you can go down, right?,And it goes from beginning to end. 
 You walk in, the first thingnyou've got to do,,the overall arc of your presentation,nit's got to start like a rocket.,You've got maybe 10 seconds --,between 10 and 30 seconds,ndepending on how long the pitch is --,to get their attention.,In my case, I've invested.,I've gotten millions of dollarsnfrom PowerPoint pitches.,"I've invested millions."nThat should get you right there.,This can be a factnor something counterintuitive.,It can be a story or an experience.,But you've got to grabntheir emotional attention, focused on you,,within that first few seconds.,And then from there,nyou've got to take them,on a very solid, steady, upward path,nright from beginning to end.,Everything has to reinforce this. 
 And you've got to get betternand better and better,,revving up to the very end,,then you've got to -- boom! --,knock them out of the park.,You want to get themnto such an emotional high,they're ready to write you a check,nthrow money at you,,before you leave. 
 How do you do that?,First of all, logical progression.,Any time you go backwards,nany time you skip a step --,imagine walking up a staircasenwhere some of the treads are missing,,or the heights are different.,You stop, you need to figure outna nice, logical progression.,Start with what the market is:nWhy are you going to do X, Y or Z?,And then you've got to tell menhow you're going to do it,,and what you're going to do.,And it's got to flownfrom beginning to end. 
 You've got to let me knownthere are touchstones,,to tie in to the restnof the world out there.,For example, referencencompanies I've heard of,,or basic items in your business.,I want to know about thingsnthat I can relate to:,validators, or anything that tells mensomebody else has approved this,,or there's outside validation.,It can be sales; it can benyou got an award for something;,it can be people have done it before;,it can be your beta testsnare going great, whatever.,I want to know validation --nnot just what you're telling me,,but that somebodynor something else out there,says this makes sense.,And then, I'm looking for the upside;nI need a believable upside.,That's two parts; it's gotnto be upside and believable.,The upside means if you tell menthat five years out,,you're making a million dollars a year,nthat's not really upside.,Telling me you'll be makingna billion dollars a year --,that's not believable.,So it's got to be both. 
 On the other hand are thingsnthat take the emotional level down.,You have to recover from those.,For example, anythingnthat I know is not true.,"We have no competition.nNobody makes a widget like this.",Odds are I know somebodynwho's made a widget,,and the minute you tell me that,,I discount half of whatnyou're saying from then on.,Anything I don't understand,,where I have to make the leapnmyself, in my own head,,will stop the flow of the presentation.,So you've got to take menthrough like a sixth-grader --,dub, dub, dub --nbut without patronizing me.,And it's a very tricky path.,But if you can do it,nit works really well. 
 Anything that's inconsistentnwithin your concept --,if you tell me sales of X, Y or Znare 10 million dollars,,five slides later,nthey're five million dollars ...,One may have been gross sales,none may have been net sales,,but I want to know that all the numbersnmake sense together. 
 And then, finally: anythingnthat's an error or a typo,,or a stupid mistake or a linenthat's in the wrong place --,that shows me that if you can't dona presentation, how can you run a company?,So this all feeds in together. 
 The best way to do thisnis to look at our betters,,people who have done this before.,Let's look at the most successfulntechnology executive in the business,,and see how a presentation goes.,Bill Gates's PowerPointnpresentation over here.,Here's Gates doing a thing for Windows.,Is this how to do a PowerPointnpresentation? What do you think?,No. Who do you think we shouldnlook at as our role model? 
 Oh, isn't that funny!nThere's another great one over here.,OK, Steve Jobs.,You want absolute --nthis is the Zen of presentation, right?,Here he is, one little guy,nblack jeans and stuff,,on a totally empty stage.,What are you focusing on?,You're focusing on him!nThis is Steve Jobs. 
 So are these wonderful long bullet points,nwhole list of things good?,No, they're not. The longnbullet points are bad.,What's good? Short. Short bullet points.,But you know what? Even better than shortnbullet points are no bullet points.,Just give me the headline.,And you know what?,How many bullet pointsndoes Steve Jobs use?,Basically, none.,What do you do?,Best of all, images. Just a simple image.,I look at the image;na picture's worth a thousand words.,You look at the imagenand you've got the whole thing.,Then you come back to me; you're focusednon me, why I'm such a great guy,,why you want to invest,nwhy this all makes sense. 
 That said, we only have a very short time,,so let's run through the thingsnto include in your presentation.,First of all, none of these big,nlong-titled slides,with blah, blah, I'm presentingnto so-and-so on X date.,I know the day, I know who I am --nI don't need all that.,Just give me your company logo.,I look at the logo,nand it ties it to my brain.,Then I come back to you.nI'm focused on you, OK?,You give me your quick, 15-secondnor 30-second intro, grab my attention.,Then you give mena quick business overview.,This is not a five-minute pitch.nThis is, you know, two sentences.,"We build widgets for the X, Y, Z market.",Or, "We sell services to help do X."nYou know, whatever.,And that is like the picturenon the outside of a jigsaw puzzle box.,That lets me know the context.,It gives me the armature for the wholenthing you'll be going through;,it lets me put everythingnin relation to what you've told me. 
 Then you've got to walk me through,nshow me who your management team is.,I want to know the size of the market.nWhy is this market worth getting at?,I want to know your product,nthat's very important.,Now, this is notna product pitch or sales pitch.,I don't want to know all the ins and outs,njust what the heck is it?,If it's a website, show mena screenshot of your website.,Don't do a live demo.nNever do a live demo.,Do a canned demo,nor something that lets me know,why people are goingnto buy whatever it is. 
 Now that I know what you're selling,,tell me how you make money on it.,For every X you sell, you get Y,nor services of Z.,I want to know what the business modelnis on a per-unit basis,,or for the actual product you're selling.,I want to know who you're selling tonin terms of customers,and if you have any specialnrelationships that will help you,,whether it's a distribution relationshipnor a producing partner.,Again, validation.,This helps to say you're biggernthan just one little thing over here. 
 But everybody has competition.,There's never been a companynwith no competition,,even if the competitionnis the old way of doing something.,I want to know exactlynwhat your competition is,,and that will help me judgenhow you fit into the whole operation.,I want to know how you're special. 
 I know what your competition does --,how are you going to preventnthem from eating your lunch?,All this ties into the financial overview.,And you can't do a VC pitchnwithout giving me your financials.,I want to know a year or two back,nor as long as you've been in existence.,And I want to knownfour or five years forward.,Five is a bit much. Probably four. 
 And I want to know how that businessnmodel, on a product basis,,will translate into a company model:nHow many widgets will you sell?,You make X amount per widget.nI want to know what the driver is.,We'll have 1,000 customersnthis year and 10,000 the next,,our revenues will do this and that.,That gives me the whole picturenfor the next several years,into which I'm investing.,And I want to know how the moneynfrom me will help you get there.,You're going to opennan offshore plant in China,,you're going to spend it allnon sales and marketing,,you're going to go to Tahiti, whatever. 
 But then comes the ask,nwhere you tell me how much you want.,You're looking for 5 million --nat what valuation?,Two million? 100,000?,What's the money in so far? Who invested?,I hope you invested -- if you can't investnin your own thing, why should I?,So I like to know if you havenfriends and family,,or angel investors, or more VCs before.,What's the capital structurenup until this point?,Finally, having done all that,nyou've now told me the whole thing,,so now you bring it backnto that conclusion.,This is that rocket going up.,Hopefully everything has been positive.,And everything you say clicks,nit all makes sense.,And I'm thinking, "This is really great!" 
 Then you take me backnto just your logo on the screen.,And I look at the logo -- OK, good.,Now I come back to you.nNothing else to look at, right?,Now you've got to wrap it upnto give me the final -- boom! --,the final pitch that's goingnto send me into space.,Now, in the process of doing this,,how do you remembernthe sequences and do it?,You've noticed I'm not lookingnat the screen, right?,The screen is in front of me,,so I couldn't even see if I wanted to. 
 So how do I know what's going on?,Well, I have a laptop in front of me.,You're looking at me and at this.,What am I looking at?,You think that I'm looking at that?,No, I'm looking, actually,,at a special versionnof PowerPoint over here,,which shows me the slidesnahead and behind, my notes,,so I can see what's going on.,PowerPoint has this built intonevery copy of it that's shipped.,If you use Apple's Keynote,nit's got an even better version.,There's another program callednOvation you can get from Adobe,that they bought last summer,,which helps you run the timersnand lets you figure out what's going on. 
 So, here's my wrap-upnto take you to the moon, right?,I usually do a Top 10,nbut we don't have time,,so: David's Top Five Presentation Tips.,Number five: always use presenter mode,,or Ovation, or presenter tools.,It lets you knownexactly where you're going,,helps you pace yourself,ngives you a timer, the whole bit. 
 Number four: always use remote control.,Have you seen me touchnthe computer? No. Why not?,Because I'm using remote control.nAlways use remote control. 
 Number three: the handouts you givenare not your presentation.,If you follow my suggestions,,you'll have a very spare,nZen-like presentation,,which is great to convey who you arenand get people emotionally involved,,but not good as a handout.,You want a handout that gives moreninformation; it has to stand without you. 
 Number two: don't read your speech.nCan you imagine? 
 (Reading) "You should investnin my company ... " 
 It doesn't work.,And the number one presentation tip:nnever, ever look at the screen.,You're making a connectionnwith your audience,,and you always wantna one-on-one connection.,The screen should come up behind you,and supplement what you're doing,ninstead of replace you.,And that is how to pitch to a VC.A great way to start, I think, with my view of simplicity,is to take a look at TED. Here you are, understanding why we're here,,what's going on with no difficulty at all.,The best A.I. in the planet would find it complex and confusing,,and my little dog Watson would find it simple and understandable,but would miss the point.,(Laughter),He would have a great time.,And of course, if you're a speaker here, like Hans Rosling,,a speaker finds this complex, tricky. But in Hans Rosling's case,,he had a secret weapon yesterday,,literally, in his sword swallowing act.,And I must say, I thought of quite a few objects,that I might try to swallow today and finally gave up on,,but he just did it and that was a wonderful thing. 
 So Puck meant not only are we fools in the pejorative sense,,but that we're easily fooled. In fact, what Shakespeare,was pointing out is we go to the theater in order to be fooled,,so we're actually looking forward to it.,We go to magic shows in order to be fooled.,And this makes many things fun, but it makes it difficult to actually,get any kind of picture on the world we live in or on ourselves. 
 And our friend, Betty Edwards,,the "Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain" lady, shows these two tables,to her drawing class and says,,"The problem you have with learning to draw,is not that you can't move your hand,,but that the way your brain perceives images is faulty.,It's trying to perceive images into objects,rather than seeing what's there.",And to prove it, she says, "The exact size and shape of these tabletops,is the same, and I'm going to prove it to you.",She does this with cardboard, but since I have,an expensive computer here,I'll just rotate this little guy around and ...,Now having seen that -- and I've seen it hundreds of times,,because I use this in every talk I give -- I still can't see,that they're the same size and shape, and I doubt that you can either. 
 So what do artists do? Well, what artists do is to measure.,They measure very, very carefully.,And if you measure very, very carefully with a stiff arm and a straight edge,,you'll see that those two shapes are,exactly the same size.,And the Talmud saw this a long time ago, saying,,"We see things not as they are, but as we are.",I certainly would like to know what happened to the person,who had that insight back then,,if they actually followed it to its ultimate conclusion. 
 So if the world is not as it seems and we see things as we are,,then what we call reality is a kind of hallucination,happening inside here. It's a waking dream,,and understanding that that is what we actually exist in,is one of the biggest epistemological barriers in human history.,And what that means: "simple and understandable",might not be actually simple or understandable,,and things we think are "complex" might be made simple and understandable.,Somehow we have to understand ourselves to get around our flaws.,We can think of ourselves as kind of a noisy channel.,The way I think of it is, we can't learn to see,until we admit we're blind.,Once you start down at this very humble level,,then you can start finding ways to see things.,And what's happened, over the last 400 years in particular,,is that human beings have invented "brainlets" --,little additional parts for our brain --,made out of powerful ideas that help us,see the world in different ways.,And these are in the form of sensory apparatus --,telescopes, microscopes -- reasoning apparatus --,various ways of thinking -- and, most importantly,,in the ability to change perspective on things. 
 I'll talk about that a little bit.,It's this change in perspective,on what it is we think we're perceiving,that has helped us make more progress in the last 400 years,than we have in the rest of human history.,And yet, it is not taught in any K through 12 curriculum in America that I'm aware of. 
 So one of the things that goes from simple to complex,is when we do more. We like more.,If we do more in a kind of a stupid way,,the simplicity gets complex,and, in fact, we can keep on doing it for a very long time.,But Murray Gell-Mann yesterday talked about emergent properties;,another name for them could be "architecture",as a metaphor for taking the same old material,and thinking about non-obvious, non-simple ways of combining it.,And in fact, what Murray was talking about yesterday in the fractal beauty of nature --,of having the descriptions,at various levels be rather similar --,all goes down to the idea that the elementary particles,are both sticky and standoffish,,and they're in violent motion.,Those three things give rise to all the different levels,of what seem to be complexity in our world. 
 But how simple?,So, when I saw Roslings' Gapminder stuff a few years ago,,I just thought it was the greatest thing I'd seen,in conveying complex ideas simply.,But then I had a thought of, "Boy, maybe it's too simple.",And I put some effort in to try and check,to see how well these simple portrayals of trends over time,actually matched up with some ideas and investigations from the side,,and I found that they matched up very well.,So the Roslings have been able to do simplicity,without removing what's important about the data. 
 Whereas the film yesterday that we saw,of the simulation of the inside of a cell,,as a former molecular biologist, I didn't like that at all.,Not because it wasn't beautiful or anything,,but because it misses the thing that most students fail to understand,about molecular biology, and that is:,why is there any probability at all of two complex shapes,finding each other just the right way,so they combine together and be catalyzed?,And what we saw yesterday was,every reaction was fortuitous;,they just swooped in the air and bound, and something happened.,But in fact, those molecules are spinning at the rate of,about a million revolutions per second;,they're agitating back and forth their size every two nanoseconds;,they're completely crowded together, they're jammed,,they're bashing up against each other.,And if you don't understand that in your mental model of this stuff,,what happens inside of a cell seems completely mysterious and fortuitous,,and I think that's exactly the wrong image,for when you're trying to teach science. 
 So, another thing that we do is to confuse adult sophistication,with the actual understanding of some principle.,So a kid who's 14 in high school,gets this version of the Pythagorean theorem,,which is a truly subtle and interesting proof,,but in fact it's not a good way to start learning about mathematics.,So a more direct one, one that gives you more of the feeling of math,,is something closer to Pythagoras' own proof, which goes like this:,so here we have this triangle, and if we surround that C square with,three more triangles and we copy that,,notice that we can move those triangles down like this.,And that leaves two open areas that are kind of suspicious ...,and bingo. That is all you have to do.,And this kind of proof is the kind of proof,that you need to learn when you're learning mathematics,in order to get an idea of what it means,before you look into the, literally, 1,200 or 1,500 proofs,of Pythagoras' theorem that have been discovered. 
 Now let's go to young children.,This is a very unusual teacher,who was a kindergarten and first-grade teacher,,but was a natural mathematician.,So she was like that jazz musician friend you have who never studied music,but is a terrific musician;,she just had a feeling for math.,And here are her six-year-olds,,and she's got them making shapes out of a shape.,So they pick a shape they like -- like a diamond, or a square,,or a triangle, or a trapezoid -- and then they try and make,the next larger shape of that same shape, and the next larger shape.,You can see the trapezoids are a little challenging there. 
 And what this teacher did on every project,was to have the children act like first it was a creative arts project,,and then something like science.,So they had created these artifacts.,Now she had them look at them and do this ... laborious,,which I thought for a long time, until she explained to me was,to slow them down so they'll think.,So they're cutting out the little pieces of cardboard here,and pasting them up. 
 But the whole point of this thing is,for them to look at this chart and fill it out.,"What have you noticed about what you did?",And so six-year-old Lauren there noticed that the first one took one,,and the second one took three more,and the total was four on that one,,the third one took five more and the total was nine on that one,,and then the next one.,She saw right away that the additional tiles that you had to add,around the edges was always going to grow by two,,so she was very confident about how she made those numbers there.,And she could see that these were the square numbers up until about six,,where she wasn't sure what six times six was,and what seven times seven was,,but then she was confident again.,So that's what Lauren did. 
 And then the teacher, Gillian Ishijima, had the kids,bring all of their projects up to the front of the room and put them on the floor,,and everybody went batshit: "Holy shit! They're the same!",No matter what the shapes were, the growth law is the same.,And the mathematicians and scientists in the crowd,will recognize these two progressions,as a first-order discrete differential equation,and a second-order discrete differential equation,,derived by six-year-olds.,Well, that's pretty amazing.,That isn't what we usually try to teach six-year-olds. 
 So, let's take a look now at how we might use the computer for some of this.,And so the first idea here is,just to show you the kind of things that children do.,I'm using the software that we're putting on the $100 laptop.,So I'd like to draw a little car here --,I'll just do this very quickly -- and put a big tire on him.,And I get a little object here and I can look inside this object,,I'll call it a car. And here's a little behavior: car forward.,Each time I click it, car turn.,If I want to make a little script to do this over and over again,,I just drag these guys out and set them going.,And I can try steering the car here by ...,See the car turn by five here?,So what if I click this down to zero?,It goes straight. That's a big revelation for nine-year-olds.,Make it go in the other direction.,But of course, that's a little bit like kissing your sister,as far as driving a car,,so the kids want to do a steering wheel;,so they draw a steering wheel.,And we'll call this a wheel.,See this wheel's heading here?,If I turn this wheel, you can see that number over there going minus and positive.,That's kind of an invitation to pick up this name of,those numbers coming out there,and to just drop it into the script here,,and now I can steer the car with the steering wheel. 
 And it's interesting.,You know how much trouble the children have with variables,,but by learning it this way, in a situated fashion,,they never forget from this single trial,what a variable is and how to use it.,And we can reflect here the way Gillian Ishijima did.,So if you look at the little script here,,the speed is always going to be 30.,We're going to move the car according to that over and over again.,And I'm dropping a little dot for each one of these things;,they're evenly spaced because they're 30 apart.,And what if I do this progression that the six-year-olds did,of saying, "OK, I'm going to increase the speed by two each time,,and then I'm going to increase the distance by the speed each time?,What do I get there?",We get a visual pattern of what these nine-year-olds called acceleration. 
 So how do the children do science? 
 (Video) Teacher: [Choose] objects that you think will fall to the Earth at the same time. 
 Student 1: Ooh, this is nice. 
 Teacher: Do not pay any attention,to what anybody else is doing.,Who's got the apple? 
 Alan Kay: They've got little stopwatches.,Student 2: What did you get? What did you get?,AK: Stopwatches aren't accurate enough. 
 Student 3: 0.99 seconds. 
 Teacher: So put "sponge ball" ... 
 Student 4l: [I decided to] do the shot put and the sponge ball,because they're two totally different weights,,and if you drop them at the same time,,maybe they'll drop at the same speed. 
 Teacher: Drop. Class: Whoa! 
 AK: So obviously, Aristotle never asked a child,about this particular point,because, of course, he didn't bother doing the experiment,,and neither did St. Thomas Aquinas.,And it was not until Galileo actually did it,that an adult thought like a child,,only 400 years ago.,We get one child like that about every classroom of 30 kids,who will actually cut straight to the chase. 
 Now, what if we want to look at this more closely?,We can take a movie of what's going on,,but even if we single stepped this movie,,it's tricky to see what's going on.,And so what we can do is we can lay out the frames side by side,or stack them up.,So when the children see this, they say, "Ah! Acceleration,",remembering back four months when they did their cars sideways,,and they start measuring to find out what kind of acceleration it is.,So what I'm doing is measuring from the bottom of one image,to the bottom of the next image, about a fifth of a second later,,like that. And they're getting faster and faster each time,,and if I stack these guys up, then we see the differences; the increase,in the speed is constant.,And they say, "Oh, yeah. Constant acceleration.,We've done that already.",And how shall we look and verify that we actually have it?,So you can't tell much from just making the ball drop there,,but if we drop the ball and run the movie at the same time,,we can see that we have come up with an accurate physical model. 
 Galileo, by the way, did this very cleverly,by running a ball backwards down the strings of his lute.,I pulled out those apples to remind myself to tell you that,this is actually probably a Newton and the apple type story,,but it's a great story.,And I thought I would do just one thing,on the $100 laptop here just to prove that this stuff works here.,So once you have gravity, here's this --,increase the speed by something,,increase the ship's speed.,If I start the little game here that the kids have done,,it'll crash the space ship.,But if I oppose gravity, here we go ... Oops!,(Laughter),One more.,Yeah, there we go. Yeah, OK? 
 I guess the best way to end this is with two quotes:,Marshall McLuhan said,,"Children are the messages that we send to the future,",but in fact, if you think of it,,children are the future we send to the future.,Forget about messages;,children are the future,,and children in the first and second world,and, most especially, in the third world,need mentors.,And this summer, we're going to build five million of these $100 laptops,,and maybe 50 million next year.,But we couldn't create 1,000 new teachers this summer to save our life.,That means that we, once again, have a thing where we can put technology out,,but the mentoring that is required to go,from a simple new iChat instant messaging system,to something with depth is missing.,I believe this has to be done with a new kind of user interface,,and this new kind of user interface could be done,with an expenditure of about 100 million dollars.,It sounds like a lot, but it is literally 18 minutes of what we're spending in Iraq --,we're spending 8 billion dollars a month; 18 minutes is 100 million dollars --,so this is actually cheap.,And Einstein said,,"Things should be as simple as possible, but not simpler.",Thank you.Allison Hunt: My three minutes hasn't started yet, has it? 
 Chris Anderson: No, you can't start the three minutes.,Reset the three minutes, that's just not fair. 
 AH: Oh my God, it's harsh up here.,I mean I'm nervous enough as it is. 
 But I am not as nervous as I was five weeks ago.,Five weeks ago I had total hip replacement surgery.,Do you know that surgery?,Electric saw, power drill, totally disgusting,unless you're David Bolinsky, in which case it's all truth and beauty.,Sure David, if it's not your hip, it's truth and beauty. 
 Anyway, I did have a really big epiphany around the situation,,so Chris invited me to tell you about it.,But first you need to know two things about me.,Just two things.,I'm Canadian, and I'm the youngest of seven kids.,Now, in Canada, we have that great healthcare system.,That means we get our new hips for free.,And being the youngest of seven,,I have never been at the front of the line for anything. OK? 
 So my hip had been hurting me for years.,I finally went to the doctor, which was free.,And she referred me to an orthopedic surgeon, also free.,Finally got to see him after 10 months of waiting -- almost a year.,That is what free gets you.,I met the surgeon, and he took some free X-rays,,and I got a good look at them. And you know,,even I could tell my hip was bad,,and I actually work in marketing.,So he said, "Allison, we've got to get you on the table.,I'm going to replace your hip -- it's about an 18-month wait.",18 more months.,I'd already waited 10 months, and I had to wait 18 more months. 
 You know, it's such a long wait that I actually,started to even think about it in terms of TEDs.,I wouldn't have my new hip for this TED.,I wouldn't have my new hip for TEDGlobal in Africa.,I would not have my new hip for TED2008.,I would still be on my bad hip. That was so disappointing. 
 So, I left his office and I was walking through the hospital,,and that's when I had my epiphany.,This youngest of seven had to get herself to the front of the line.,Oh yeah. 
 Can I tell you how un-Canadian that is?,We do not think that way.,We don't talk about it. It's not even a consideration.,In fact, when we're traveling abroad, it's how we identify fellow Canadians.,"After you." "Oh, no, no. After you.",Hey, are you from Canada? "Oh, me too! Hi!","Great! Excellent!" 
 So no, suddenly I wasn't averse to butting any geezer off the list.,Some 70-year-old who wanted his new hip,so he could be back golfing, or gardening.,No, no. Front of the line. 
 So by now I was walking the lobby, and of course, that hurt,,because of my hip, and I kind of needed a sign.,And I saw a sign.,In the window of the hospital's tiny gift shop there was a sign,that said, "Volunteers Needed." Hmm.,Well, they signed me up immediately.,No reference checks. None of the usual background stuff, no.,They were desperate for volunteers,because the average age of the volunteer at the hospital gift shop was 75.,Yeah. They needed some young blood. 
 So, next thing you know, I had my bright blue volunteer vest,,I had my photo ID, and I was fully trained by my 89-year-old boss.,I worked alone.,Every Friday morning I was at the gift shop.,While ringing in hospital staff's Tic Tacs,,I'd casually ask, "What do you do?",Then I'd tell them, "Well, I'm getting my hip replaced -- in 18 months.,It's gonna be so great when the pain stops. Ow!",All the staff got to know the plucky, young volunteer. 
 My next surgeon's appointment was, coincidentally,,right after a shift at the gift shop.,So, naturally, I had my vest and my identification.,I draped them casually over the chair in the doctor's office.,And you know, when he walked in,,I could just tell that he saw them.,Moments later, I had a surgery date just weeks away,,and a big fat prescription for Percocet. 
 Now, word on the street was that it was actually,my volunteering that got me to the front of the line.,And, you know, I'm not even ashamed of that.,Two reasons.,First of all, I am going to take such good care of this new hip.,But also I intend to stick with the volunteering,,which actually leads me to the biggest epiphany of them all.,Even when a Canadian cheats the system,,they do it in a way that benefits society.So, I kind of believe that we're in like the "cave-painting" era of computer interfaces.,Like, they're very kind of -- they don't go as deep or as emotionally engaging as they possibly could be,and I'd like to change all that.,Hit me.,OK. So I mean, this is the kind of status quo interface, right?,It's very flat, kind of rigid.,And OK, so you could sex it up and like go to a much more lickable Mac,,you know, but really it's the kind of same old crap we've had for the last,,you know, 30 years.,(Laughter) (Applause),Like I think we really put up with a lot of crap with our computers.,I mean it's point and click, it's like the menus, icons, it's all the kind of same thing. 
 And so one kind of information space that I take inspiration from is my real desk.,It's so much more subtle, so much more visceral,-- you know, what's visible, what's not.,And I'd like to bring that experience to the desktop.,So I kind of have a -- this is BumpTop.,It's kind of like a new approach to desktop computing.,So you can bump things -- they're all physically, you know, manipulable and stuff.,And instead of that point and click, it's like a push and pull,,things collide as you'd expect them. Just like on my real desk,,I can -- let me just grab these guys -- I can turn things into piles,instead of just the folders that we have.,And once things are in a pile I can browse them by throwing them into a grid,,or you know, flip through them like a book,or I can lay them out like a deck of cards.,When they're laid out, I can pull things to new locations or delete things,or just quickly sort a whole pile, you know, just immediately, right?,And then, it's all smoothly animated, instead of these jarring changes you see in today's interfaces. 
 Also, if I want to add something to a pile, well, how do I do that?,I just toss it to the pile, and it's added right to the top. It's a kind of nice way.,Also some of the stuff we can do is,,for these individual icons we thought -- I mean,,how can we play with the idea of an icon, and push that further?,And one of the things I can do is make it bigger,if I want to emphasize it and make it more important. 
 But what's really cool is that since there's a physics simulation running under this,,it's actually heavier. So the lighter stuff doesn't really move,but if I throw it at the lighter guys, right?,(Laughter),So it's cute, but it's also like a subtle channel of conveying information, right?,This is heavy so it feels more important. So it's kind of cool. 
 Despite computers everywhere paper really hasn't disappeared,,because it has a lot of, I think, valuable properties.,And some of those we wanted to transfer to the icons in our system.,So one of the things you can do to our icons, just like paper, is crease them and fold them,,just like paper. Remember, you know, something for later.,Or if you want to be destructive, you can just crumple it up,and, you know, toss it to the corner.,Also just like paper, around our workspace,we'll pin things up to the wall to remember them later,,and I can do the same thing here,,and you know, you'll see post-it notes and things like that around people's offices.,And I can pull them off when I want to work with them. 
 So, one of the criticisms of this kind of approach to organization is that,,you know, "Okay, well my real desk is really messy. I don't want that mess on my computer.",So one thing we have for that is like a grid align,,kind of -- so you get that more traditional desktop. Things are kind of grid aligned.,More boring, but you still have that kind of colliding and bumping.,And you can still do fun things like make shelves on your desktop. 
 Let's just break this shelf. Okay, that shelf broke.,I think beyond the icons, I think another really cool domain for this software --,I think it applies to more than just icons and your desktop -- but browsing photographs.,I think you can really enrich the way we browse our photographs,and bring it to that kind of shoebox of, you know, photos with your family on the kitchen table kind of thing.,I can toss these things around. They're so much more tangible and touchable --,and you know I can double-click on something to take a look at it.,And I can do all that kind of same stuff I showed you before.,So I can pile things up, I can flip through it, I can, you know --,okay, let's move this photo to the back, let's delete this guy here,,and I think it's just a much more rich kind of way of interacting with your information. 
 And that's BumpTop. Thanks!"Jó napot, pacák" Which,nas somebody here must surely know,,means "What's up, guys?" in Magyar,,that peculiar non-Indo-Europeannlanguage spoken by Hungarians,for which, given the factnthat cognitive diversity is,at least as threatenednas biodiversity on this planet,,few would have imagined muchnof a future even a century or two ago.,But there it is: "Jó napot, pacák",I said somebody here mustnsurely know, because,despite the fact that there aren'tnthat many Hungarians to begin with,,and the further fact that, so farnas I know, there's not a drop,of Hungarian blood in my veins,nat every critical juncture of my life,there has been a Hungarian friendnor mentor there beside me.,I even have dreams that takenplace in landscapes,I recognize as the landscapesnof Hungarian films,,especially the earlynmovies of Miklos Jancso. 
 So, how do I explain thisnmysterious affinity?,Maybe it's because my nativenstate of South Carolina,,which is not much smallernthan present-day Hungary,,once imagined a future for itselfnas an independent country.,And as a consequence of that presumption,,my hometown was burnednto the ground by an invading army,,an experience that has befallennmany a Hungarian town and village,throughout its long and troubled history.,Or maybe it's because whennI was a teenager back in the '50s,,my uncle Henry -- havingndenounced the Ku Klux Klan,and been bombed for his troublenand had crosses burned in his yard,,living under death threat -- took his wifenand children to Massachusetts for safety,and went back to South Carolinanto face down the Klan alone.,That was a very Hungarian thing to do,,as anyone will attest who remembers 1956.,And of course, from timento time Hungarians,have inventedntheir own equivalent of the Klan. 
 Well, it seems to me that thisnHungarian presence in my life,is difficult to account for, but ultimatelynI ascribe it to an admiration,for people with a complex moral awareness,,with a heritage of guilt and defeatnmatched by defiance and bravado.,It's not a typical mindsetnfor most Americans,,but it is perforce typicalnof virtually all Hungarians.,So, "Jó napot, pacák!" 
 I went back to South Carolinanafter some 15 years amid the alien corn,at the tail end of the 1960s,,with the recklessncondescension of that era,thinking I would save my people.,Never mind the fact that they were slownto acknowledge they needed saving.,I labored in that vineyardnfor a quarter century before,making my way to a little kingdomnof the just in upstate South Carolina,,a Methodist-affiliated institutionnof higher learning called Wofford College.,I knew nothing about Wofford,and even less about Methodism,,but I was reassured on the first daynthat I taught at Wofford College,to find, among the auditorsnin my classroom,,a 90-year-old Hungarian, surroundednby a bevy of middle-aged European women,who seemed to functionnas an entourage of Rhinemaidens. 
 His name was Sandor Teszler.,He was a puckish widowernwhose wife and children were dead,and whose grandchildren lived far away.,In appearance, he resemblednMahatma Gandhi,,minus the loincloth,nplus orthopedic boots.,He had been born in 1903 in the provinces,of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire,,in what later would become Yugoslavia.,He was ostracized as a child,nnot because he was a Jew --,his parents weren't verynreligious anyhow --,but because he had been bornnwith two club feet,,a condition which, in those days,nrequired institutionalization,and a succession of painful operationsnbetween the ages of one and 11.,He went to the commercial businessnhigh school as a young man,in Budapest, and therenhe was as smart as he was modest,and he enjoyed a considerable success.nAnd after graduation,when he went into textilenengineering, the success continued.,He built one plant after another.,He married and had two sons. Henhad friends in high places who,assured him that he was of greatnvalue to the economy. 
 Once, as he had leftninstructions to have done,,he was summoned in the middle of the nightnby the night watchman at one of his plants.,The night watchman had caughtnan employee who was stealing socks --,it was a hosiery mill, and he simplynbacked a truck up to the loading dock,and was shoveling in mountains of socks.,Mr. Teszler went down to the plantnand confronted the thief and said,,"But why do you steal from me? If younneed money you have only to ask.",The night watchman, seeing how thingsnwere going and waxing indignant,,said, "Well, we're going to callnthe police, aren't we?",But Mr. Teszler answered, "No,nthat will not be necessary.,He will not steal from us again." 
 Well, maybe he was too trusting,nbecause he stayed where he was,long after the Nazi Anschluss in Austria,and even after the arrestsnand deportations began in Budapest.,He took the simple precaution of havingncyanide capsules placed in lockets,that could be worn about the necksnof himself and his family.,And then one day, it happened:nhe and his family were arrested,and they were taken to a deathnhouse on the Danube.,In those early days of the FinalnSolution, it was handcrafted brutality;,people were beaten to deathnand their bodies tossed into the river.,But none who entered that deathnhouse had ever come out alive.,And in a twist you would not believenin a Steven Spielberg film --,the Gauleiter who was overseeing thisnbrutal beating was the very same thief,who had stolen socksnfrom Mr. Teszler's hosiery mill.,It was a brutal beating. Andnmidway through that brutality,,one of Mr. Teszler's sons,nAndrew, looked up and said,,"Is it time to takenthe capsule now, Papa?",And the Gauleiter, who afterwardsnvanishes from this story,,leaned down and whisperedninto Mr. Teszler's ear,,"No, do not take the capsule.nHelp is on the way.",And then resumed the beating. 
 But help was on the way,nand shortly afterwards,a car arrived from the Swiss Embassy.,They were spirited to safety. Theynwere reclassified as Yugoslav citizens,and they managed to staynone step ahead of their pursuers,for the duration of the War,nsurviving burnings and bombings,and, at the end of the War,narrest by the Soviets.,Probably, Mr. Teszler had gottennsome money into Swiss bank accounts,because he managed to takenhis family first to Great Britain,,then to Long Island and then to the centernof the textile industry in the American South.,Which, as chance would have it,nwas Spartanburg, South Carolina,,the location of Wofford College.,And there, Mr. Teszler began all over againnand once again achieved immense success,,especially after he invented the process,for manufacturing a newnfabric called double-knit. 
 And then in the late 1950s, in the aftermathnof Brown v. Board of Education,,when the Klan was resurgentnall over the South,,Mr. Teszler said, "I havenheard this talk before.",And he called his topnassistant to him and asked,,"Where would you say, in thisnregion, racism is most virulent?","Well, I don't rightly know, Mr. Teszler.nI reckon that would be Kings Mountain.","Good. Buy us some land in Kings Mountain,and announce we are goingnto build a major plant there.",The man did as he was told,nand shortly afterwards,,Mr. Teszler received a visitnfrom the white mayor of Kings Mountain.,Now, you should know that at that time,,the textile industry in the Southnwas notoriously segregated.,The white mayor visitednMr. Teszler and said,,"Mr. Teszler, I trust you’re goingnto be hiring a lot of white workers.",Mr. Teszler told him, "You bring menthe best workers that you can find,,and if they are goodnenough, I will hire them.",He also received a visit from the leadernof the black community,,a minister, who said, "Mr. Teszler,nI sure hope you're going to,hire some black workersnfor this new plant of yours.",He got the same answer: "You bringnthe best workers that you can find,,and if they are goodnenough, I will hire them.",As it happens, the black minister didnhis job better than the white mayor,,but that's neither here or there.,Mr. Teszler hired 16 men:neight white, eight black. 
 They were to be his seedngroup, his future foremen.,He had installed the heavynequipment for his new process,in an abandoned storenin the vicinity of Kings Mountain,,and for two months these 16 mennwould live and work together,,mastering the new process.,He gathered them togethernafter an initial tour of that facility,and he asked if there were any questions.,There was hemming and hawingnand shuffling of feet,,and then one of the white workersnstepped forward and said,,"Well, yeah. We’ve looked at this placenand there's only one place to sleep,,there's only one place to eat,nthere's only one bathroom,,there's only one water fountain. Is thisnplant going to be integrated or what?",Mr. Teszler said, "You are being paid twice the wagesnof any other textile workers in this region,and this is how we do business.nDo you have any other questions?","No, I reckon I don't.",And two months later whennthe main plant opened,and hundreds of newnworkers, white and black,,poured in to see the facilitynfor the first time,,they were met by the 16 foremen, whitenand black, standing shoulder to shoulder.,They toured the facility and were askednif there were any questions, and,inevitably the same question arose:,"Is this plant integrated or what?",And one of the white foremennstepped forward and said,,"You are being paid twicenthe wages of any other workers,in this industry in this regionnand this is how we do business.,Do you have any other questions?" 
 And there were none. In one fell swoop,,Mr. Teszler had integrated the textilenindustry in that part of the South.,It was an achievementnworthy of Mahatma Gandhi,,conducted with the shrewdness of a lawyernand the idealism of a saint.,In his eighties, Mr. Teszler, havingnretired from the textile industry,,adopted Wofford College,,auditing courses every semester,,and because he had a tendencynto kiss anything that moved,,becoming affectionately known as "Opi"n-- which is Magyar for grandfather --,by all and sundry. Before I gotnthere, the library of the college,had been named for Mr. Teszler,nand after I arrived in 1993,,the faculty decided to honor itself by namingnMr. Teszler Professor of the College --,partly because at that pointnhe had already taken,all of the courses in the catalog,nbut mainly because,he was so conspicuouslynwiser than any one of us.,To me, it was immensely reassuringnthat the presiding spirit,of this little Methodist collegenin upstate South Carolina,was a Holocaust survivornfrom Central Europe.,Wise he was, indeed, but he alsonhad a wonderful sense of humor.,And once for an interdisciplinary class,,I was screening the opening segmentnof Ingmar Bergman's "The Seventh Seal.",As the medieval knight Antonius Blocknreturns from the wild goose chase,of the Crusades and arrivesnon the rocky shore of Sweden,,only to find the specternof death waiting for him,,Mr. Teszler sat in the darknwith his fellow students. And,as death opened his cloaknto embrace the knight,in a ghastly embrace, I heardnMr. Teszler's tremulous voice:,"Uh oh," he said, "This doesn'tnlook so good." (Laughter) 
 But it was music that was his greatestnpassion, especially opera.,And on the first occasionnthat I visited his house, he gave me,honor of deciding what piecenof music we would listen to.,And I delighted him by rejectingn"Cavalleria Rusticana",in favor of BelanBartok's "Bluebeard's Castle.",I love Bartok's music, as did Mr. Teszler,,and he had virtually every recordingnof Bartok's music ever issued.,And it was at his housenthat I heard for the first time,Bartok's Third PianonConcerto and learned from,Mr. Teszler that it had been composednin nearby Asheville, North Carolina,in the last year of the composer's life.,He was dying of leukemia and he knew it,,and he dedicated thisnconcerto to his wife,,Dita, who was herself a concert pianist.,And into the slow, second movement,nmarked "adagio religioso,",he incorporated the soundsnof birdsong that he heard,outside his window in what he knewnwould be his last spring;,he was imagining a future for hernin which he would play no part.,And clearly this compositionnis his final statement to her --,it was first performed after his death --,and through her to the world.,And just as clearly, it is saying,n"It's okay. It was all so beautiful.,Whenever you hear this, I will be there." 
 It was only after Mr. Teszler's deathnthat I learned,that the marker on the grave of BelanBartok in Hartsdale, New York,was paid for by Sandor Teszler.n"Jó napot, Bela!",Not long before Mr. Teszler’snown death at the age of 97,,he heard me hold forth on human iniquity.,I delivered a lecturenin which I described history,as, on the whole, a tidal wavenof human suffering and brutality,,and Mr. Teszler came up to me afterwardsnwith gentle reproach and said,,"You know, Doctor, human beingsnare fundamentally good.",And I made a vownto myself, then and there,,that if this man who had suchncause to think otherwise,had reached that conclusion,,I would not presume to differnuntil he released me from my vow.,And now he's dead, sonI'm stuck with my vow.,"Jó napot, Sandor!" 
 I thought my skein of Hungariannmentors had come to an end,,but almost immediately I met FrancisnRobicsek, a Hungarian doctor --,actually a heart surgeon in Charlotte, NorthnCarolina, then in his late seventies --,who had been a pioneernin open-heart surgery,,and, tinkering awaynin his garage behind his house,,had invented many of the devicesnthat are standard parts of those procedures.,He's also a prodigious art collector,nbeginning as an intern in Budapest,by collecting 16th- and 17th-centurynDutch art and Hungarian painting,,and when he came to this countrynmoving on to Spanish colonial art,,Russian icons and finally Mayan ceramics.,He's the author of seven books,nsix of them on Mayan ceramics.,It was he who broke the Mayanncodex, enabling scholars to relate,the pictographs on Mayan ceramicsnto the hieroglyphs of the Mayan script. 
 On the occasion of my firstnvisit, we toured his house,and we saw hundredsnof works of museum quality,,and then we paused in front of a closedndoor and Dr. Robicsek said,,with obvious pride, "Nownfor the piece De resistance.",And he opened the doornand we walked into a,windowless 20-by-20-foot roomnwith shelves from floor to ceiling, and,crammed on every shelfnhis collection of Mayan ceramics.,Now, I know absolutely nothingnabout Mayan ceramics,,but I wanted to be as ingratiatingnas possible so I said,,"But Dr. Robicsek, thisnis absolutely dazzling.","Yes," he said. "Thatnis what the Louvre said.,They would not leave me alonenuntil I let them have a piece,,but it was not a good one." (Laughter) 
 Well, it occurred to menthat I should invite Dr. Robicsek,to lecture at WoffordnCollege on -- what else?,-- Leonardo da Vinci. And further,nI should invite him to meet,my oldest trustee, who had majorednin French history at Yale,some 70-odd years before and,nat 89, still ruled the world's,largest privately owned textilenempire with an iron hand.,His name is Roger Milliken.nAnd Mr. Milliken agreed,,and Dr. Robicsek agreed.nAnd Dr. Robicsek visited,and delivered the lecturenand it was a dazzling success.,And afterwards we convenednat the President's House with Dr. Robicsek,on one hand, Mr. Milliken on the other.,And it was only at that moment,nas we were sitting down to dinner,,that I recognized the enormitynof the risk I had created,,because to bring these two titans,nthese two masters of the universe,together -- it was like introducing Mothranto Godzilla over the skyline of Tokyo.,If they didn't like each other,nwe could all get trampled to death. 
 But they did, they did like each other.,They got along famouslynuntil the very end of the meal,,and then they got into a furious argument.,And what they were arguing about was this:,whether the second Harry Potter movienwas as good as the first. (Laughter),Mr. Milliken said it was not.nDr. Robicsek disagreed.,I was still trying to takenin the notion that these titans,,these masters of the universe, in their sparentime watch Harry Potter movies,,when Mr. Milliken thoughtnhe would win the argument by saying,,"You just think it's so goodnbecause you didn't read the book.",And Dr. Robicsek reeled back in his chair,nbut quickly gathered his wits,,leaned forward and said, "Well,nthat is true, but I'll bet you went,to the movie with a grandchild." "Well,nyes, I did," conceded Mr. Milliken.,"Aha!" said Dr. Robicsek. "I went to the movienall by myself." (Laughter) (Applause) 
 And I realized, in thisnmoment of revelation,,that what these two men werenrevealing was the secret,of their extraordinary success,neach in his own right.,And it lay preciselynin that insatiable curiosity,,that irrepressible desire to know,nno matter what the subject,,no matter what the cost,,even at a time when the keepersnof the Doomsday Clock,are willing to bet even moneynthat the human race won't be around,to imagine anything in the yearn2100, a scant 93 years from now.,"Live each day as if itnis your last," said Mahatma Gandhi.,"Learn as if you'll live forever.",This is what I'm passionate about.nIt is precisely this.,It is this inextinguishable, undauntednappetite for learning and experience,,no matter how risible,nno matter how esoteric,,no matter how seditious it might seem.,This defines the imagined futuresnof our fellow Hungarians --,Robicsek, Teszler and Bartokn-- as it does my own.,As it does, I suspect,nthat of everybody here. 
 To which I need only add, "Ezna mi munkank; es nem is keves.",This is our task; we know it will be hard.,"Ez a mi munkank; es nem is keves.nJó napot, pacák!" (Applause)First place I'd like to take you,is what many believe will be the world's deepest natural abyss.,And I say believe because this process is still ongoing.,Right now there are major expeditions being planned for next year,that I'll talk a little bit about. 
 One of the things that's changed here,,in the last 150 years since Jules Verne,had great science-fiction concepts of what the underworld was like,,is that technology has enabled us to go to these places,that were previously completely unknown and speculated about.,We can now descend thousands of meters into the Earth with relative impunity.,Along the way we've discovered fantastic abysses and chambers so large,that you can see for hundreds of meters,without a break in the line of sight.,When you go on a thing like this, we can usually be in the field,for anywhere from two to four months,,with a team as small as 20 or 30, to as big as 150. 
 And a lot of people ask me, you know,,what kind of people do you get for a project like this?,While our selection process,is not as rigorous as NASA, it's nonetheless thorough.,We're looking for competence, discipline, endurance, and strength.,In case you're wondering, this is our strength test.,(Laughter),But we also value esprit de corps,and the ability to diplomatically resolve inter-personal conflict,while under great stress in remote locations. 
 We have already gone far beyond the limits of human endurance.,From the entrance, this is nothing like a commercial cave.,You're looking at Camp Two in a place called J2, not K2, but J2.,We're roughly two days from the entrance at that point.,And it's kind of like a high altitude mountaineering trip in reverse,,except that you're now running a string of these things down.,The idea is to try to provide some measure of physical comfort,while you're down there, otherwise in damp, moist, cold conditions in utterly dark places.,I should mention that everything you're seeing here, by the way,,is artificially illuminated at great effort.,Otherwise it is completely dark in these places. 
 The deeper you go, the more you run into a conflict with water.,It's basically like a tree collecting water coming down.,And eventually you get to places where it is formidable and dangerous,and unfortunately slides just don't do justice.,So I've got a very brief clip here that was taken in the late 1980s.,So descend into Huautla Plateau in Mexico.,(Video),Now I have to tell you that the techniques being shown here,are obsolete and dangerous.,We would not do this today unless we were doing it for film.,(Laughter) 
 Along that same line, I have to tell you,that with the spate of Hollywood movies that came out last year,,we have never seen monsters underground --,at least the kind that eat you.,If there is a monster underground,,it is the crushing psychological remoteness,that begins to hit every member of the team,once you cross about three days inbound from the nearest entrance. 
 Next year I'll be leading an international team to J2.,We're going to be shooting from minus 2,600 meters --,that's a little over 8,600 feet down --,at 30 kilometers from the entrance.,The lead crews will be underground for pushing 30 days straight.,I don't think there's been a mission like that in a long time. 
 Eventually, if you keep going down in these things,,probability says that you're going to run into a place like this.,It's a place where there's a fold in the geologic stratum,that collects water and fills to the roof.,And when you used to find these things,,they would put a label on a map that said terminal siphon.,Now I remember that term really well for two reasons.,Number one, it's the name of my rock band, and second,,is because the confrontation of these things,forced me to become an inventor.,And we've since gone on to develop,many generations of gadgets for exploring places like this. 
 This is some life-support equipment closed-cycle.,And you can use that now to go for many kilometers horizontally,underwater and to depths of 200 meters straight down underwater.,When you do this kind of stuff it's like doing EVA.,It's like doing extra-vehicular activity in space,,but at much greater distances, and at much greater physical peril.,So it makes you think about how to design your equipment,for long range, away from a safe haven. 
 Here's a clip from a National Geographic movie,that came out in 1999. 
 (Video) Narrator: Exploration is a physical process,of putting your foot in places where humans have never stepped before.,This is where the last little nugget of totally unknown territory remains on this planet.,To experience it is a privilege. 
 Bill Stone: That was taken in Wakulla Springs, Florida.,Couple of things to note about that movie. Every piece of equipment,that you saw in there did not exist before 1999.,It was developed within a two-year period and used on actual exploratory projects.,This gadget you see right here was called the digital wall mapper,,and it produced the first three-dimensional map anybody has ever done,of a cave, and it happened to be underwater in Wakulla Springs.,It was that gadget that serendipitously opened a door,to another unexplored world. 
 This is Europa.,Carolyn Porco mentioned another one called Enceladus the other day.,This is one of the places where planetary scientists,believe there is a highest probability of the detection,of the first life off earth in the ocean that exists below there.,For those who have never seen this story,,Jim Cameron produced a really wonderful IMAX movie,couple of years ago, called "Aliens of the Deep.",There was a brief clip -- 
 (Video) Narrator: A mission to explore under the ice of Europa,would be the ultimate robotic challenge.,Europa is so far away that even at the speed of light,,it would take more than an hour for the command just to reach the vehicle.,It has to be smart enough to avoid terrain hazards,and to find a good landing site on the ice.,Now we have to get through the ice.,You need a melt probe.,It's basically a nuclear-heated torpedo.,The ice could be anywhere from three to 16 miles deep.,Week after week, the melt probe will sink of its own weight,through the ancient ice, until finally --,Now, what are you going to do when you reach the surface of that ocean?,You need an AUV, an autonomous underwater vehicle.,It needs to be one smart puppy, able to navigate,and make decisions on its own in an alien ocean. 
 BS: What Jim didn't know when he released that movie,was that six months earlier NASA had funded a team I assembled,to develop a prototype for the Europa AUV.,I mean, I cut through three years of engineering meetings, design,and system integration, and introduced DEPTHX --,Deep Phreatic Thermal Explorer.,And as the movie says, this is one smart puppy.,It's got 96 sensors, 36 onboard computers,,100,000 lines of behavioral autonomy code,,packs more than 10 kilos of TNT in electrical onboard equivalent. 
 This is the target site,,the world's deepest hydrothermal spring at Cenote Zacaton in northern Mexico.,It's been explored to a depth of 292 meters,and beyond that nobody knows anything.,This is part of DEPTHX's mission. 
 There are two primary targets we're doing here.,One is, how do you do science autonomy underground?,How do you take a robot and turn it into a field microbiologist?,There are more stages involved here,than I've got time to tell you about, but basically we drive,through the space, we populate it with environmental variables --,sulphide, halide, things like that.,We calculate gradient surfaces, and drive the bot over to a wall,where there's a high probability of life.,We move along the wall, in what's called proximity operations,,looking for changes in color.,If we see something that looks interesting, we pull it into a microscope.,If it passes the microscopic test, we go for a collection.,We either draw in a liquid sample,,or we can actually take a solid core from the wall.,No hands at the wheel.,This is all behavioral autonomy here,that's being conducted by the robot on its own. 
 The real hat trick for this vehicle, though,,is a disruptive new navigation system we've developed,,known as 3D SLAM, for simultaneous localization and mapping.,DEPTHX is an all-seeing eyeball.,Its sensor beams look both forward and backward at the same time,,allowing it to do new exploration,while it's still achieving geometric sensor-lock,on what it's gone through already. 
 What I'm going to show you next,is the first fully autonomous robotic exploration underground,that's ever been done.,This May, we're going to go from minus 1,000 meters in Zacaton,,and if we're very lucky, DEPTHX will bring back the first,robotically-discovered division of bacteria.,The next step after that is to test it in Antartica and then,,if the funding continues and NASA has the resolution to go,,we could potentially launch by 2016, and by 2019,we may have the first evidence of life off this planet. 
 What then of manned space exploration?,The government recently announced plans to return to the moon by 2024.,The successful conclusion of that mission will result,in infrequent visitation of the moon by a small number,of government scientists and pilots.,It will leave us no further along in the general expansion,of humanity into space than we were 50 years ago.,Something fundamental has to change,if we are to see common access to space in our lifetime. 
 What I'm going to show you next are a couple of controversial ideas.,And I hope you'll bear with me and have some faith,that there's credibility behind what we're going to say here.,There are three underpinnings of working in space privately.,One of them is the requirement,for economical earth-to-space transport.,The Bert Rutans and Richard Bransons of this world,have got this in their sights and I salute them.,Go, go, go. 
 The next thing we need are places to stay on orbit.,Orbital hotels to start with, but workshops for the rest of us later on.,The final missing piece, the real paradigm-buster, is this:,a gas station on orbit.,It's not going to look like that.,If it existed, it would change all future spacecraft design and space mission planning. 
 Now, to give you a chance to understand,why there is power in that statement,,I've got to give you the basics of Space 101.,And the first thing is everything you do in space you pay by the kilogram.,Anybody drink one of these here this week?,You'd pay 10,000 dollars for that in orbit.,That's more than you pay for TED,,if Google dropped their sponsorship.,(Laughter),The second is more than 90 percent of the weight of a vehicle is in propellant.,Thus, every time you'd want to do anything in space,,you are literally blowing away enormous sums of money,every time you hit the accelerator.,Not even the guys at Tesla can fight that physics. 
 So, what if you could get your gas at a 10th the price?,There is a place where you can.,In fact, you can get it better -- you can get it at 14 times lower,if you can find propellant on the moon.,There is a little-known mission that was launched,by the Pentagon, 13 years ago now, called Clementine.,And the most amazing thing that came out of that mission,was a strong hydrogen signature at Shackleton crater,on the south pole of the moon.,That signal was so strong,,it could only have been produced by 10 trillion tons of water,buried in the sediment, collected over millions and billions of years,by the impact of asteroids and comet material. 
 If we're going to get that, and make that gas station possible,,we have to figure out ways to move large volumes of payload through space.,We can't do that right now.,The way you normally build a system right now is you have a tube stack,that has to be launched from the ground,,and resist all kinds of aerodynamic forces.,We have to beat that.,We can do it because in space there are no aerodynamics.,We can go and use inflatable systems for almost everything.,This is an idea that, again, came out of Livermore back in 1989,,with Dr. Lowell Wood's group.,And we can extend that now to just about everything.,Bob Bigelow currently has a test article in the orbit.,We can go much further.,We can build space tugs, orbiting platforms for holding cryogens and water.,There's another thing.,When you're coming back from the moon,,you have to deal with orbital mechanics.,It says you're moving 10,000 feet per second faster,than you really want to be to get back to your gas station. 
 You got two choices.,You can burn rocket fuel to get there, or you can do something really incredible.,You can dive into the stratosphere,,and precisely dissipate that velocity, and come back out to the space station.,It has never been done.,It's risky and it's going to be one hell of a ride --,better than Disney.,The traditional approach to space exploration,has been that you carry all the fuel you need,to get everybody back in case of an emergency.,If you try to do that for the moon,,you're going to burn a billion dollars in fuel alone sending a crew out there.,But if you send a mining team there,,without the return propellant, first --,(Laughter),Did any of you guys hear the story of Cortez?,This is not like that. I'm much more like Scotty.,I like this equipment, you know, and I really value it,so we're not going to burn the gear.,But, if you were truly bold you could get it there, manufacture it,,and it would be the most dramatic demonstration,that you could do something worthwhile off this planet,that has ever been done.,There's a myth that you can't do anything in space,for less than a trillion dollars and 20 years.,That's not true.,In seven years, we could pull off,an industrial mission to Shackleton and demonstrate,that you could provide commercial reality out of this in low-earth orbit. 
 We're living in one of the most exciting times in history.,We're at a magical confluence where private wealth,and imagination are driving the demand for access to space.,The orbital refueling stations I've just described,could create an entirely new industry and provide the final key,for opening space to the general exploration.,To bust the paradigm a radically different approach is needed.,We can do it by jump-starting with an industrial,Lewis and Clark expedition to Shackleton crater,,to mine the moon for resources, and demonstrate,they can form the basis for a profitable business on orbit. 
 Talk about space always seems to be hung on ambiguities,of purpose and timing.,I would like to close here by putting a stake in the sand at TED.,I intend to lead that expedition.,(Applause),It can be done in seven years with the right backing.,Those who join me in making it happen will become a part of history,and join other bold individuals from time past,who, had they been here today, would have heartily approved. 
 There was once a time when people did bold things to open the frontier.,We have collectively forgotten that lesson.,Now we're at a time when boldness is required to move forward.,100 years after Sir Ernest Shackleton wrote these words,,I intend to plant an industrial flag on the moon,and complete the final piece,that will open the space frontier, in our time, for all of us.,Thank you.,(Applause)What I'm going to show you first,nas quickly as I can,,is some foundational work,nsome new technology,that we brought to Microsoftnas part of an acquisition,almost exactly a year ago.,This is Seadragon, and it's an environment,in which you can eithernlocally or remotely interact,with vast amounts of visual data. 
 We're looking at many, many gigabytesnof digital photos here,and kind of seamlesslynand continuously zooming in,,panning through it,nrearranging it in any way we want.,And it doesn't matter how muchninformation we're looking at,,how big these collections arenor how big the images are.,Most of them are ordinaryndigital camera photos,,but this one, for example,nis a scan from the Library of Congress,,and it's in the 300 megapixel range.,It doesn't make any difference,because the only thing that ought to limitnthe performance of a system like this one,is the number of pixels on your screennat any given moment.,It's also very flexible architecture.,This is an entire book,nso this is an example of non-image data.,This is "Bleak House" by Dickens.,Every column is a chapter.,To prove to you that it's really text,nand not an image,,we can do somethingnlike so, to really show,that this is a real representationnof the text; it's not a picture.,Maybe this is an artificial waynto read an e-book.,I wouldn't recommend it. 
 This is a more realistic case,nan issue of The Guardian.,Every large imagenis the beginning of a section.,And this really gives younthe joy and the good experience,of reading the real paper versionnof a magazine or a newspaper,,which is an inherentlynmulti-scale kind of medium.,We've done something,with the corner of this particularnissue of The Guardian.,We've made up a fake adnthat's very high resolution --,much higher than in an ordinary ad --,and we've embedded extra content.,If you want to see the featuresnof this car, you can see it here.,Or other models,nor even technical specifications.,And this really getsnat some of these ideas,about really doing awaynwith those limits on screen real estate.,We hope that this means no more pop-ups,and other rubbish like that --nshouldn't be necessary. 
 Of course, mapping is onenof those obvious applications,for a technology like this.,And this one I reallynwon't spend any time on,,except to say that we have thingsnto contribute to this field as well.,But those are all the roads in the U.S.,superimposed on topnof a NASA geospatial image.,So let's pull up, now, something else.,This is actually live on the Web now;nyou can go check it out. 
 This is a project called Photosynth,nwhich marries two different technologies.,One of them is Seadragon,and the other is some verynbeautiful computer-vision research,done by Noah Snavely, a graduate studentnat the University of Washington,,co-advised by Steve Seitz at U.W.,and Rick Szeliski at Microsoft Research.,A very nice collaboration.,And so this is live on the Web.nIt's powered by Seadragon.,You can see thatnwhen we do these sorts of views,,where we can dive through images,and have this kindnof multi-resolution experience. 
 But the spatial arrangement of the imagesnhere is actually meaningful.,The computer vision algorithmsnhave registered these images together,so that they correspond to the realnspace in which these shots --,all taken near Grassi Lakesnin the Canadian Rockies --,all these shots were taken.,So you see elements here,of stabilized slide-shownor panoramic imaging,,and these things havenall been related spatially.,I'm not sure if I have timento show you any other environments.,Some are much more spatial.,I would like to jump straightnto one of Noah's original data-sets --,this is from an early prototypenthat we first got working this summer --,to show you what I think,is really the punch linenbehind the Photosynth technology,,It's not necessarily so apparent,from looking at the environmentsnwe've put up on the website.,We had to worrynabout the lawyers and so on. 
 This is a reconstructionnof Notre Dame Cathedral,that was done entirely computationallynfrom images scraped from Flickr.,You just type Notre Dame into Flickr,,and you get some pictures of guysnin T-shirts, and of the campus and so on.,And each of these orange conesnrepresents an image,that was discoverednto belong to this model.,And so these are all Flickr images,,and they've all been relatednspatially in this way.,We can just navigatenin this very simple way. 
 (Applause) 
 (Applause ends) 
 You know, I never thoughtnthat I'd end up working at Microsoft.,It's very gratifying to haventhis kind of reception here. 
 (Laughter) 
 I guess you can see this isnlots of different types of cameras:,it's everything from cell-phone camerasnto professional SLRs,,quite a large number of them,nstitched together in this environment.,If I can find somenof the sort of weird ones --,So many of them are occludednby faces, and so on.,Somewhere in here there is actuallyna series of photographs -- here we go.,This is actually a poster of Notre Damenthat registered correctly.,We can dive in from the poster,to a physical view of this environment. 
 What the point here really is,is that we can do thingsnwith the social environment.,This is now taking data from everybody --,from the entire collective memory,nvisually, of what the Earth looks like --,and link all of that together.,Those photos become linked,nand they make something emergent,that's greater than the sum of the parts.,You have a model that emergesnof the entire Earth.,Think of this as the long tailnto Stephen Lawler's Virtual Earth work.,And this is something that growsnin complexity as people use it,,and whose benefits become greaternto the users as they use it.,Their own photos are getting taggednwith meta-data that somebody else entered.,If somebody botherednto tag all of these saints,and say who they all are,nthen my photo of Notre Dame Cathedral,suddenly gets enrichednwith all of that data,,and I can use it as an entry pointnto dive into that space,,into that meta-verse,nusing everybody else's photos,,and do a kind of a cross-modal,and cross-user social experience that way.,And of course, a by-product of all of thatnis immensely rich virtual models,of every interesting part of the Earth,,collected not just from overhead flightsnand from satellite images,and so on, but from the collective memory. 
 Thank you so much. 
 (Applause) 
 (Applause ends) 
 Chris Anderson:nDo I understand this right?,What your software is going to allow,,is that at some point,nreally within the next few years,,all the pictures that are sharednby anyone across the world,are going to link together? 
 BAA: Yes. What this is reallyndoing is discovering,,creating hyperlinks,nif you will, between images.,It's doing that based on the contentninside the images.,And that gets really excitingnwhen you think about the richness,of the semantic informationna lot of images have.,Like when you do a web search for images,,you type in phrases,,and the text on the web page is carryingna lot of information,about what that picture is of.,What if that picture linksnto all of your pictures?,The amount of semanticninterconnection and richness,that comes out of that is really huge.,It's a classic network effect. 
 CA: Truly incredible. Congratulations.In the next 18 minutes, I'm going to take you on a journey.,And it's a journey that you and I have been on for many years now,,and it began some 50 years ago, when humans first stepped off our planet.,And in those 50 years, not only did we literally, physically set foot on the moon,,but we have dispatched robotic spacecraft to all the planets -- all eight of them --,and we have landed on asteroids, we have rendezvoused with comets,,and, at this point in time, we have a spacecraft on its way to Pluto,,the body formerly known as a planet.,And all of these robotic missions are part of a bigger human journey:,a voyage to understand something, to get a sense of our cosmic place,,to understand something of our origins, and how Earth, our planet,,and we, living on it, came to be. 
 And of all the places in the solar system that we might go to,and search for answers to questions like this,,there's Saturn. And we have been to Saturn before --,we visited Saturn in the early 1980s --,but our investigations of Saturn have become far more in-depth in detail,since the Cassini spacecraft, traveling across interplanetary space,for seven years, glided into orbit around Saturn in the summer of 2004,,and became at that point the farthest robotic outpost,that humanity had ever established around the Sun. 
 Now, the Saturn system is a rich planetary system.,It offers mystery, scientific insight and obviously splendor beyond compare,,and the investigation of this system has enormous cosmic reach.,In fact, just studying the rings alone, we stand to learn a lot,about the discs of stars and gas that we call the spiral galaxies.,And here's a beautiful picture of the Andromeda Nebula,,which is our closest, largest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way.,And then, here's a beautiful composite of the Whirlpool Galaxy,,taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. 
 So the journey back to Saturn is really part of and is also a metaphor,for a much larger human voyage,to understand the interconnectedness of everything around us,,and also how humans fit into that picture.,And it pains me that I can't tell you all that we have learned with Cassini.,I can't show you all the beautiful pictures that we've taken,in the last two and a half years, because I simply don't have the time.,So I'm going to concentrate on two of the most exciting stories,that have emerged out of this major exploratory expedition,that we are conducting around Saturn,,and have been for the past two and a half years. 
 Saturn is accompanied by a very large and diverse collection of moons.,They range in size from a few kilometers across to as big across as the U.S.,Most of the beautiful pictures we've taken of Saturn, in fact,,show Saturn in accompaniment with some of its moons. Here's Saturn with Dione,,and then, here's Saturn showing the rings edge-on,,showing you just how vertically thin they are, with the moon Enceladus.,Now, two of the 47 moons that Saturn has are standouts. 
 And those are Titan and Enceladus. Titan is Saturn's largest moon,,and, until Cassini had arrived there,,was the largest single expanse of unexplored terrain,that we had remaining in our solar system.,And it is a body that has long intrigued people who've watched the planets.,It has a very large, thick atmosphere,,and in fact, its surface environment was believed to be,more like the environment we have here on the Earth,,or at least had in the past, than any other body in the solar system.,Its atmosphere is largely molecular nitrogen, like you are breathing here in this room,,except that its atmosphere is suffused with,simple organic materials like methane and propane and ethane.,And these molecules high up in the atmosphere of Titan,get broken down, and their products join together to make haze particles.,This haze is ubiquitous. It's completely global and enveloping Titan.,And that's why you cannot see down to the surface,with our eyes in the visible region of the spectrum. 
 But these haze particles, it was surmised,,before we got there with Cassini, over billions and billions of years,,gently drifted down to the surface and coated the surface,in a thick organic sludge.,So like the equivalent, the Titan equivalent, of tar, or oil, or what -- we didn't know what.,But this is what we suspected. And these molecules,,especially methane and ethane, can be liquids at the surface temperatures of Titan.,And so it turns out that methane is to Titan what water is to the Earth.,It's a condensable in the atmosphere,,and so recognizing this circumstance brought to the fore,a whole world of bizarre possibilities. You can have methane clouds, OK,,and above those clouds, you have this hundreds of kilometers of haze,,which prevent any sunlight from getting to the surface.,The temperature at the surface is some 350 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. 
 But despite that cold, you could have rain falling down on the surface of Titan.,And doing on Titan what rain does on the Earth: it carves gullies; it forms rivers,and cataracts; it can create canyons; it can pool in large basins and craters.,It can wash the sludge off high mountain peaks and hills,,down into the lowlands. So stop and think for a minute.,Try to imagine what the surface of Titan might look like.,It's dark. High noon on Titan is as dark as deep earth twilight on the Earth.,It's cold, it's eerie, it's misty,,it might be raining, and you might be standing,on the shores of Lake Michigan brimming with paint thinner. (Laughter) 
 That is the view that we had of the surface of Titan before we got there with Cassini,,and I can tell you that what we have found on Titan, though it is not the same in detail,,is every bit as fascinating as that story is.,And for us, it has been like -- the Cassini people --,it has been like a Jules Verne adventure come true.,As I said, it has a thick, extensive atmosphere.,This is a picture of Titan, backlit by the Sun, with the rings as a beautiful backdrop.,And yet another moon there --,I don't even know which one it is. It's a very extensive atmosphere.,We have instruments on Cassini which can see down to the surface,through this atmosphere, and my camera system is one of them.,And we have taken pictures like this.,And what you see is bright and dark regions, and that's about as far as it got for us.,It was so mystifying: we couldn't make out what we were seeing on Titan.,When you look closer at this region, you start to see things,like sinuous channels -- we didn't know. You see a few round things.,This, we later found out, is, in fact, a crater,,but there are very few craters on the surface of Titan,,meaning it's a very young surface.,And there are features that look tectonic.,They look like they've been pulled apart.,Whenever you see anything linear on a planet,,it means there's been a fracture, like a fault.,And so it's been tectonically altered. 
 But we couldn't make sense of our images,,until, six months after we got into orbit,,an event occurred that many have regarded,as the highlight of Cassini's investigation of Titan.,And that was the deployment of the Huygens probe,,the European-built Huygens probe that Cassini had carried,for seven years across the solar system. We deployed it to the atmosphere of Titan,,it took two and a half hours to descend, and it landed on the surface.,And I just want to emphasize how significant an event this is.,This is a device of human making,,and it landed in the outer solar system for the first time in human history.,It is so significant that, in my mind,,this was an event that should have been celebrated,with ticker tape parades in every city across the U.S. and Europe,,and sadly, that wasn't the case.,(Laughter). 
 It was significant for another reason. This is an international mission,,and this event was celebrated in Europe, in Germany,,and the celebratory presentations were given in English accents,,and American accents, and German accents, and French and Italian and Dutch accents.,It was a moving demonstration of what the words,"united nations" are supposed to mean:,a true union of nations joined together in a colossal effort for good.,And, in this case, it was a massive undertaking to explore a planet,,and to come to understand a planetary system,that, for all of human history, had been unreachable,,and now humans had actually touched it.,So it was -- I mean, I'm getting goose bumps just talking about it.,It was a tremendously emotional event,,and it's something that I will personally never forget, and you shouldn't either.,(Applause). 
 But anyway, the probe took measurements of the atmosphere on the way down,,and it also took panoramic pictures.,And I can't tell you what it was like to see the first pictures,of Titan's surface from the probe. And this is what we saw.,And it was a shocker, because it was everything we wanted,those other pictures taken from orbit to be.,It was an unambiguous pattern, a geological pattern.,It's a dendritic drainage pattern that can be formed only by the flow of liquids.,And you can follow these channels,and you can see how they all converge.,And they converge into this channel here, which drains into this region.,You are looking at a shoreline.,Was this a shoreline of fluids? We didn't know.,But this is somewhat of a shoreline. 
 This picture is taken at 16 kilometers.,This is the picture taken at eight kilometers, OK? Again, the shoreline.,Okay, now, 16 kilometers, eight kilometers -- this is roughly an airline altitude.,If you were going to take an airplane trip across the U.S.,,you would be flying at these altitudes.,So, this is the picture you would have at the window of Titanian Airlines,as you fly across the surface of Titan. (Laughter) 
 And then finally, the probe came to rest on the surface,,and I'm going to show you, ladies and gentlemen,,the first picture ever taken from the surface of a moon in the outer solar system.,And here is the horizon, OK?,These are probably water ice pebbles, yes?,(Applause).,And obviously, it landed in one of these flat, dark regions,and it didn't sink out of sight. So it wasn't fluid that we landed in.,What the probe came down in was basically,the Titan equivalent of a mud flat.,This is an unconsolidated ground that is suffused with liquid methane.,And it's probably the case that this material,has washed off the highlands of Titan,through these channels that we saw,,and has drained over billions of years to fill in low-lying basins.,And that is what the Huygens probe landed in. 
 But still, there was no sign in our images,,or even in the Huygens' images, of any large, open bodies of fluids.,Where were they? It got even more puzzling when we found dunes.,OK, so this is our movie of the equatorial region of Titan,,showing these dunes. These are dunes that are 100 meters tall,,separated by a few kilometers,,and they go on for miles and miles and miles.,There's hundreds, up to a 1,000 or 1,200 miles of dunes.,This is the Saharan desert of Titan.,It's obviously a place which is very dry, or you wouldn't get dunes. 
 So again, it got puzzling that there were no bodies of fluid,,until finally, we saw lakes in the polar regions.,And there is a lake scene in the south polar region of Titan.,It's about the size of Lake Ontario.,And then, only a week and a half ago,,we flew over the north pole of Titan and found, again,,we found a feature here the size of the Caspian Sea.,So it seems that the liquids, for some reason we don't understand,,or during at least this season, are apparently at the poles of Titan.,And I think you would agree that we have found Titan,is a remarkable, mystical place. It's exotic, it's alien, but yet strangely Earth-like,,and having Earth-like geological formations,and a tremendous geographical diversity,,and is a fascinating world whose only rival in the solar system,for complexity and richness is the Earth itself. 
 And so now we go onto Enceladus. Enceladus is a small moon,,it's about a tenth the size of Titan. And you can see it here next to England,,just to show you the size. This is not meant to be a threat.,(Laughter).,And Enceladus is very white, it's very bright,,and its surface is obviously wrecked with fractures.,It is a very geologically active body.,But the mother lode of discoveries on Enceladus,was found at the south pole -- and we're looking at the south pole here --,where we found this system of fractures.,And they're a different color because they're a different composition.,They are coated. These fractures are coated with organic materials.,Moreover, this whole, entire region, the south polar region,,has elevated temperatures. It's the hottest place on the planet, on the body.,That's as bizarre as finding that the Antarctic on the Earth is hotter than the tropics. 
 And then, when we took additional pictures, we discovered,that from these fractures are issuing jets of fine, icy particles,extending hundreds of miles into space.,And when we color-code this image, to bring out the faint light levels,,we see that these jets feed a plume,that, in fact, we see, in other images, goes thousands of miles,into the space above Enceladus.,My team and I have examined images like this,,and like this one, and have thought about the other results from Cassini.,And we have arrived at the conclusion,that these jets may be erupting from pockets,of liquid water under the surface of Enceladus. 
 So we have, possibly, liquid water, organic materials and excess heat.,In other words, we have possibly stumbled upon,the holy grail of modern day planetary exploration,,or in other words, an environment that is potentially suitable for living organisms.,And I don't think I need to tell you that the discovery of life,elsewhere in our solar system,,whether it be on Enceladus or elsewhere,,would have enormous cultural and scientific implications.,Because if we could demonstrate that genesis had occurred,not once, but twice, independently, in our solar system,,then that means, by inference, it has occurred a staggering number of times,throughout the universe and its 13.7 billion year history. 
 Right now, Earth is the only planet still that we know is teeming with life.,It is precious, it is unique,,it is still, so far, the only home we've ever known.,And if any of you were alert and coherent during the 1960s --,and we'd forgive you, if you weren't, OK --,you would remember this very famous picture,taken by the Apollo 8 astronauts in 1968.,It was the first time that Earth was imaged from space,,and it had an enormous impact on our sense of place in the universe,,and our sense of responsibility for the protection of our own planet. 
 Well, we on Cassini have taken an equivalent first,,a picture that no human eye has ever seen before.,It is a total eclipse of the Sun, seen from the other side of Saturn.,And in this impossibly beautiful picture,,you see the main rings backlit by the Sun,,you see the refracted image of the Sun,and you see this ring created, in fact,,by the exhalations of Enceladus.,But as if that weren't brilliant enough, we can spot, in this beautiful image,,sight of our own planet,,cradled in the arms of Saturn's rings. 
 Now, there is something deeply moving,about seeing ourselves from afar,,and capturing the sight of our little, blue-ocean planet,in the skies of other worlds.,And that, and the perspective of ourselves that we gain from that,,may be, in the end, the finest reward that we earn,from this journey of discovery that started half a century ago.,And thank you very much.,(Applause)You know, I'm struck by how one of the implicit themes of TED,is compassion, these very moving demonstrations we've just seen:,HIV in Africa, President Clinton last night.,And I'd like to do a little collateral thinking, if you will,,about compassion and bring it from the global level to the personal.,I'm a psychologist, but rest assured,,I will not bring it to the scrotal. 
 (Laughter) 
 There was a very important study done a while ago,at Princeton Theological Seminary that speaks to why it is,that when all of us have so many opportunities to help,,we do sometimes, and we don't other times.,A group of divinity students at the Princeton Theological Seminary,were told that they were going to give a practice sermon,and they were each given a sermon topic.,Half of those students were given, as a topic,,the parable of the Good Samaritan:,the man who stopped the stranger in --,to help the stranger in need by the side of the road.,Half were given random Bible topics.,Then one by one, they were told they had to go to another building,and give their sermon.,As they went from the first building to the second,,each of them passed a man who was bent over and moaning,,clearly in need. The question is: Did they stop to help? 
 The more interesting question is:,Did it matter they were contemplating the parable,of the Good Samaritan? Answer: No, not at all.,What turned out to determine whether someone would stop,and help a stranger in need,was how much of a hurry they thought they were in --,were they feeling they were late, or were they absorbed,in what they were going to talk about.,And this is, I think, the predicament of our lives:,that we don't take every opportunity to help,because our focus is in the wrong direction. 
 There's a new field in brain science, social neuroscience.,This studies the circuitry in two people's brains,that activates while they interact.,And the new thinking about compassion from social neuroscience,is that our default wiring is to help.,That is to say, if we attend to the other person,,we automatically empathize, we automatically feel with them.,There are these newly identified neurons, mirror neurons,,that act like a neuro Wi-Fi, activating in our brain,exactly the areas activated in theirs. We feel "with" automatically.,And if that person is in need, if that person is suffering,,we're automatically prepared to help. At least that's the argument. 
 But then the question is: Why don't we?,And I think this speaks to a spectrum,that goes from complete self-absorption,,to noticing, to empathy and to compassion.,And the simple fact is, if we are focused on ourselves,,if we're preoccupied, as we so often are throughout the day,,we don't really fully notice the other.,And this difference between the self and the other focus,can be very subtle. 
 I was doing my taxes the other day, and I got to the point,where I was listing all of the donations I gave,,and I had an epiphany, it was -- I came to my check,to the Seva Foundation and I noticed that I thought,,boy, my friend Larry Brilliant would really be happy,that I gave money to Seva.,Then I realized that what I was getting from giving,was a narcissistic hit -- that I felt good about myself.,Then I started to think about the people in the Himalayas,whose cataracts would be helped, and I realized,that I went from this kind of narcissistic self-focus,to altruistic joy, to feeling good,for the people that were being helped. I think that's a motivator. 
 But this distinction between focusing on ourselves,and focusing on others,is one that I encourage us all to pay attention to.,You can see it at a gross level in the world of dating.,I was at a sushi restaurant a while back,and I overheard two women talking about the brother of one woman,,who was in the singles scene. And this woman says,,"My brother is having trouble getting dates,,so he's trying speed dating." I don't know if you know speed dating?,Women sit at tables and men go from table to table,,and there's a clock and a bell, and at five minutes, bingo,,the conversation ends and the woman can decide,whether to give her card or her email address to the man,for follow up. And this woman says,,"My brother's never gotten a card, and I know exactly why.,The moment he sits down, he starts talking non-stop about himself;,he never asks about the woman." 
 And I was doing some research in the Sunday Styles section,of The New York Times, looking at the back stories of marriages --,because they're very interesting -- and I came to the marriage,of Alice Charney Epstein. And she said,that when she was in the dating scene,,she had a simple test she put people to.,The test was: from the moment they got together,,how long it would take the guy to ask her a question,with the word "you" in it.,And apparently Epstein aced the test, therefore the article. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now this is a -- it's a little test,I encourage you to try out at a party.,Here at TED there are great opportunities.,The Harvard Business Review recently had an article called,"The Human Moment," about how to make real contact,with a person at work. And they said, well,,the fundamental thing you have to do is turn off your BlackBerry,,close your laptop, end your daydream,and pay full attention to the person.,There is a newly coined word in the English language,for the moment when the person we're with whips out their BlackBerry,or answers that cell phone, and all of a sudden we don't exist.,The word is "pizzled": it's a combination of puzzled and pissed off. 
 (Laughter) 
 I think it's quite apt. It's our empathy, it's our tuning in,which separates us from Machiavellians or sociopaths.,I have a brother-in-law who's an expert on horror and terror --,he wrote the Annotated Dracula, the Essential Frankenstein --,he was trained as a Chaucer scholar,,but he was born in Transylvania,and I think it affected him a little bit.,At any rate, at one point my brother-in-law, Leonard,,decided to write a book about a serial killer.,This is a man who terrorized the very vicinity we're in,many years ago. He was known as the Santa Cruz strangler.,And before he was arrested, he had murdered his grandparents,,his mother and five co-eds at UC Santa Cruz. 
 So my brother-in-law goes to interview this killer,and he realizes when he meets him,that this guy is absolutely terrifying.,For one thing, he's almost seven feet tall.,But that's not the most terrifying thing about him.,The scariest thing is that his IQ is 160: a certified genius.,But there is zero correlation between IQ and emotional empathy,,feeling with the other person.,They're controlled by different parts of the brain. 
 So at one point, my brother-in-law gets up the courage,to ask the one question he really wants to know the answer to,,and that is: how could you have done it?,Didn't you feel any pity for your victims?,These were very intimate murders -- he strangled his victims.,And the strangler says very matter-of-factly,,"Oh no. If I'd felt the distress, I could not have done it.,I had to turn that part of me off. I had to turn that part of me off." 
 And I think that that is very troubling,,and in a sense, I've been reflecting on turning that part of us off.,When we focus on ourselves in any activity,,we do turn that part of ourselves off if there's another person.,Think about going shopping and think about the possibilities,of a compassionate consumerism.,Right now, as Bill McDonough has pointed out,,the objects that we buy and use have hidden consequences.,We're all unwitting victims of a collective blind spot.,We don't notice and don't notice that we don't notice,the toxic molecules emitted by a carpet or by the fabric on the seats.,Or we don't know if that fabric is a technological,or manufacturing nutrient; it can be reused,or does it just end up at landfill? In other words,,we're oblivious to the ecological and public health,and social and economic justice consequences,of the things we buy and use.,In a sense, the room itself is the elephant in the room,,but we don't see it. And we've become victims,of a system that points us elsewhere. Consider this. 
 There's a wonderful book called,Stuff: The Hidden Life of Everyday Objects.,And it talks about the back story of something like a t-shirt.,And it talks about where the cotton was grown,and the fertilizers that were used and the consequences,for soil of that fertilizer. And it mentions, for instance,,that cotton is very resistant to textile dye;,about 60 percent washes off into wastewater.,And it's well known by epidemiologists that kids,who live near textile works tend to have high rates of leukemia.,There's a company, Bennett and Company, that supplies Polo.com,,Victoria's Secret -- they, because of their CEO, who's aware of this,,in China formed a joint venture with their dye works,to make sure that the wastewater,would be properly taken care of before it returned to the groundwater.,Right now, we don't have the option to choose the virtuous t-shirt,over the non-virtuous one. So what would it take to do that? 
 Well, I've been thinking. For one thing,,there's a new electronic tagging technology that allows any store,to know the entire history of any item on the shelves in that store.,You can track it back to the factory. Once you can track it,back to the factory, you can look at the manufacturing processes,that were used to make it, and if it's virtuous,,you can label it that way. Or if it's not so virtuous,,you can go into -- today, go into any store,,put your scanner on a palm onto a barcode,,which will take you to a website.,They have it for people with allergies to peanuts.,That website could tell you things about that object.,In other words, at point of purchase,,we might be able to make a compassionate choice. 
 There's a saying in the world of information science:,ultimately everybody will know everything.,And the question is: will it make a difference?,Some time ago when I was working for The New York Times,,it was in the '80s, I did an article,on what was then a new problem in New York --,it was homeless people on the streets.,And I spent a couple of weeks going around with a social work agency,that ministered to the homeless. And I realized seeing the homeless,through their eyes that almost all of them were psychiatric patients,that had nowhere to go. They had a diagnosis. It made me --,what it did was to shake me out of the urban trance where,,when we see, when we're passing someone who's homeless,in the periphery of our vision, it stays on the periphery.,We don't notice and therefore we don't act. 
 One day soon after that -- it was a Friday -- at the end of the day,,I went down -- I was going down to the subway. It was rush hour,and thousands of people were streaming down the stairs.,And all of a sudden as I was going down the stairs,I noticed that there was a man slumped to the side,,shirtless, not moving, and people were just stepping over him --,hundreds and hundreds of people.,And because my urban trance had been somehow weakened,,I found myself stopping to find out what was wrong.,The moment I stopped, half a dozen other people,immediately ringed the same guy.,And we found out that he was Hispanic, he didn't speak any English,,he had no money, he'd been wandering the streets for days, starving,,and he'd fainted from hunger.,Immediately someone went to get orange juice,,someone brought a hotdog, someone brought a subway cop.,This guy was back on his feet immediately.,But all it took was that simple act of noticing,,and so I'm optimistic. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I'm a medical illustrator,,and I come from a slightly different point of view.,I've been watching, since I grew up,,the expressions of truth and beauty in the arts,and truth and beauty in the sciences.,And while these are both wonderful things in their own right --,they both have very wonderful things going for them --,truth and beauty as ideals that can be looked at by the sciences,and by math are almost like the ideal conjoined twins,that a scientist would want to date.,(Laughter),These are expressions of truth as awe-full things,,by meaning they are things you can worship.,They are ideals that are powerful. They are irreducible.,They are unique. They are useful --,sometimes, often a long time after the fact.,And you can actually roll some of the pictures now,,because I don't want to look at me on the screen. 
 Truth and beauty are things,that are often opaque to people who are not in the sciences.,They are things that describe beauty in a way,that is often only accessible if you understand the language,and the syntax of the person,who studies the subject in which truth and beauty is expressed.,If you look at the math, E=mc squared,,if you look at the cosmological constant,,where there's an anthropic ideal, where you see that life had to evolve,from the numbers that describe the universe --,these are things that are really difficult to understand. 
 And what I've tried to do,since I had my training as a medical illustrator --,since I was taught animation by my father,,who was a sculptor and my visual mentor --,I wanted to figure out a way to help people,understand truth and beauty in the biological sciences,by using animation, by using pictures, by telling stories,so that the things that are not necessarily evident to people,can be brought forth, and can be taught, and can be understood. 
 Students today are often immersed in an environment,where what they learn is subjects that have truth and beauty,embedded in them, but the way they're taught is compartmentalized,and it's drawn down to the point where the truth and beauty,are not always evident.,It's almost like that old recipe for chicken soup,where you boil the chicken until the flavor is just gone.,We don't want to do that to our students.,So we have an opportunity to really open up education. 
 And I had a telephone call from Robert Lue at Harvard,,in the Molecular and Cellular Biology Department,,a couple of years ago. He asked me if my team and I,would be interested and willing to really change,how medical and scientific education is done at Harvard.,So we embarked on a project that would explore the cell --,that would explore the truth and beauty inherent,in molecular and cellular biology,so that students could understand a larger picture,that they could hang all of these facts on.,They could have a mental image of the cell,as a large, bustling, hugely complicated city,that's occupied by micro-machines. 
 And these micro-machines really are at the heart of life.,These micro-machines,,which are the envy of nanotechnologists the world over,,are self-directed, powerful, precise, accurate devices,that are made out of strings of amino acids.,And these micro-machines power how a cell moves.,They power how a cell replicates. They power our hearts.,They power our minds. 
 And so what we wanted to do was to figure out,how we could make this story into an animation,that would be the centerpiece of BioVisions at Harvard,,which is a website that Harvard has,for its molecular and cellular biology students,that will -- in addition to all the textual information,,in addition to all the didactic stuff --,put everything together visually, so that these students,would have an internalized view of what a cell really is,in all of its truth and beauty, and be able to study,with this view in mind, so that their imaginations would be sparked,,so that their passions would be sparked,and so that they would be able to go on,and use these visions in their head to make new discoveries,and to be able to find out, really, how life works. 
 So we set out by looking at how these molecules are put together.,We worked with a theme, which is, you've got macrophages,that are streaming down a capillary,,and they're touching the surface of the capillary wall,,and they're picking up information from cells,that are on the capillary wall, and they are given this information,that there's an inflammation somewhere outside,,where they can't see and sense.,But they get the information that causes them to stop,,causes them to internalize that they need to make,all of the various parts that will cause them to change their shape,,and try to get out of this capillary and find out what's going on. 
 So these molecular motors -- we had to work,with the Harvard scientists and databank models,of the atomically accurate molecules,and figure out how they moved, and figure out what they did.,And figure out how to do this in a way,that was truthful in that it imparted what was going on,,but not so truthful that the compact crowding in a cell,would prevent the vista from happening. 
 And so what I'm going to show you is a three-minute,Reader's Digest version of the first aspect of this film,that we produced. It's an ongoing project,that's going to go another four or five years.,And I want you to look at this,and see the paths that the cell manufactures --,these little walking machines, they're called kinesins --,that take these huge loads,that would challenge an ant in relative size.,Run the movie, please. 
 But these machines that power the inside of the cells,are really quite amazing, and they really are the basis of all life,because all of these machines interact with each other.,They pass information to each other.,They cause different things to happen inside the cell.,And the cell will actually manufacture the parts that it needs,on the fly, from information,that's brought from the nucleus by molecules that read the genes.,No life, from the smallest life to everybody here,,would be possible without these little micro-machines.,In fact, it would really, in the absence of these machines,,have made the attendance here, Chris, really quite sparse.,(Laughter),(Music) 
 This is the FedEx delivery guy of the cell.,This little guy is called the kinesin,,and he pulls a sack that's full of brand new manufactured proteins,to wherever it's needed in the cell --,whether it's to a membrane, whether it's to an organelle,,whether it's to build something or repair something.,And each of us has about 100,000 of these things,running around, right now,,inside each one of your 100 trillion cells.,So no matter how lazy you feel,,you're not really intrinsically doing nothing.,(Laughter) 
 So what I want you to do when you go home,is think about this, and think about how powerful our cells are.,And think about some of the things,that we're learning about cellular mechanics.,Once we figure out all that's going on --,and believe me, we know almost a percent of what's going on --,once we figure out what's going on,,we're really going to be able to have a lot of control,over what we do with our health,,with what we do with future generations,,and how long we're going to live.,And hopefully we'll be able to use this,to discover more truth, and more beauty.,(Music) 
 But it's really quite amazing that these cells, these micro-machines,,are aware enough of what the cell needs that they do their bidding.,They work together. They make the cell do what it needs to do.,And their working together helps our bodies --,huge entities that they will never see -- function properly.,Enjoy the rest of the show. Thank you.,(Applause)We're going to go on a divento the deep sea,,and anyone that's hadnthat lovely opportunity,knows that for aboutntwo and half hours on the way down,,it's a perfectly positivelynpitch-black world.,And we used to see the most mysteriousnanimals out the window,that you couldn't describe:,these blinking lights -- a worldnof bioluminescence, like fireflies.,Dr. Edith Widder -- she's now at the OceannResearch and Conservation Association --,was able to come up with a camera,that could capture somenof these incredible animals,,and that's what you're seeingnhere on the screen. 
 That's all bioluminescence.nLike I said: just like fireflies.,There's a flying turkey under a tree. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm a geologist by training.,But I love that.,And you see, some of the bioluminescencenthey use to avoid being eaten,,some they use to attract prey,,but all of it,nfrom an artistic point of view,,is just positively amazing.,And a lot of what goes on inside --,There's a fish with glowing eyes,npulsating eyes.,Some of the colorsnare designed to hypnotize,,these lovely patterns.,And then this last one,,one of my favorites, this pinwheel design.,Just absolutely amazing,nevery single dive. 
 That's the unknown world,nand today we've only explored,about 3 percentnof what's out there in the ocean.,Already we've foundnthe world's highest mountains,,the world's deepest valleys,,underwater lakes, underwater waterfalls --,a lot of that we sharednwith you from the stage.,And in a placenwhere we thought no life at all,,we find more life, we think,nand diversity and density,than the tropical rainforest,,which tells us that we don't knownmuch about this planet at all.,There's still 97 percent,,and either that 97 percent is emptynor just full of surprises. 
 But I want to jump up to shallow water now,and look at some creaturesnthat are positively amazing.,Cephalopods -- head-foots.,As a kid I knew them as calamari, mostly. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is an octopus.,This is the work of Dr. Roger Hanlonnat the Marine Biological Lab,,and it's just fascinatingnhow cephalopods can,,with their incredible eyes,nsense their surroundings,,look at light, look at patterns.,Here's an octopus moving across the reef,,finds a spot to settle down, curls upnand then disappears into the background.,Tough thing to do. 
 In the next bit, we're goingnto see a couple squid.,Now males, when they fight,,if they're really aggressive,nthey turn white.,And these two males are fighting.,They do it by bouncingntheir butts together,,which is an interesting concept.,Now, here's a male on the leftnand a female on the right,,and the male has managednto split his coloration,so the female only always seesnthe kinder, gentler squid in him. 
 (Laughter) 
 Let's take a look at it again.nWatch the coloration:,white on the right, brown on the left.,He takes a step back,,he's keeping off the othernmales by splitting his body,,and comes up on the other side --,Bingo!,Now, I'm told that's not not justna squid phenomenon with males,,but I don't know. 
 (Laughter) 
 Cuttlefish. I love cuttlefish.,This is a Giant Australian Cuttlefish.,And there he is,nhis droopy little eyes up here.,But they can donpretty amazing things, too.,Here we're going to seenone backing into a crevice,,and watch his tentacles --,he just pulls them in,nmakes them look just like algae.,Disappears right into the background.,Positively amazing.,Here's two males fighting.,Once again, they're smart enough,nthese cephalopods;,they know not to hurt each other.,But look at the patternsnthat they can do with their skin.,That's an amazing thing. 
 Here's an octopus.,Sometimes they don't wantnto be seen when they move,,because predators can see them.,This guy can make himselfnlook like a rock,,and, looking at his environment,,can actually slide across the bottom,,using the waves and the shadowsnso he can't be seen.,His motion blendsnright into the background --,the moving rock trick. 
 So, we're learningnlots new from the shallow water.,Still exploring the deep,nbut learning lots from the shallow water.,There's a good reason why:,the shallow water's full of predatorsn-- here's a barracuda --,and if you're an octopus or a cephalopod,,you need to really understandnhow to use your surroundings to hide. 
 In the next scene, you're going to seena nice coral bottom.,And you see that an octopusnwould stand out,very easily there if you couldn'tnuse your camouflage,,use your skin to change color and texture.,Here's some algae in the foreground --,and an octopus.,Ain't that amazing? 
 Now, Roger spooked him,nso he took off in a cloud of ink,,and when he lands, the octopus says,n"Oh, I've been seen.,The best thing to do is to getnas big as I can get.",That big brown makes his eyespot very big.,So, he's bluffing.nLet's do it backwards.,I thought he was jokingnwhen he first showed it to me.,I thought it was all graphics.nSo here it is in reverse.,Watch the skin color;nwatch the skin texture.,Just an amazing animal,nit can change color and texture,to match the surroundings.,Watch him blend right into this algae.,One, two, three. 
 (Applause) 
 And now he's gone, and so am I.nThank you very much. 
 (Applause)Fifty years ago in the old Soviet Union,,a team of engineers was secretly moving a large object,through a desolate countryside.,With it, they were hoping to capture the minds of people everywhere,by being the first to conquer outer space.,The rocket was huge.,And packed in its nose was a silver ball,with two radios inside. 
 On October 4, 1957, they launched their rocket.,One of the Russian scientists wrote at the time:,"We are about to create a new planet,that we will call Sputnik.,In the olden days, explorers,like Vasco da Gama and Columbus,had the good fortune to open up the terrestrial globe.,Now we have the good fortune to open up space.,And it is for those in the future to envy us our joy." 
 You're watching snippets from "Sputnik," my fifth documentary feature,,which is just about completed.,It tells the story of Sputnik,,and the story of what happened to America as a result.,For days after the launch,,Sputnik was a wonderful curiosity.,A man-made moon visible by ordinary citizens,,it inspired awe and pride,that humans had finally launched an object into space. 
 But just three days later, on a day they called Red Monday,,the media and the politicians told us,,and we believed, that Sputnik was proof,that our enemy had beaten us,in science and technology,,and that they could now attack us with hydrogen bombs,,using their Sputnik rocket as an IBM missile. 
 All hell broke loose.,Sputnik quickly became one of the three great shocks to hit America --,historians say the equal of Pearl Harbor or 9/11.,It provoked the missile gap.,It exploded an arms race.,It began the space race.,Within a year, Congress funded huge weapons increases,,and we went from 1,200 nuclear weapons,to 20,000.,And the reactions to Sputnik went far beyond weapons increases. 
 For example, some here will remember,this day, June 1958,,the National Civil Defense Drill,,where tens of millions of people in 78 cities went underground.,Or the Gallup Poll that showed that seven in 10 Americans,believed that a nuclear war would happen,,and that at least 50 percent of our population,was going to be killed. 
 But Sputnik provoked wonderful changes as well.,For example, some in this room went to school on scholarship,because of Sputnik.,Support for engineering, math and science --,education in general -- boomed.,And Vint Cerf points out that Sputnik,led directly to ARPA, and the Internet,,and, of course, NASA. 
 My feature documentary shows how a free society,can be stampeded by those who know how to use media.,But it also shows how we can turn,what appears at first to be a bad situation,,into something that was overall very good for America.,"Sputnik" will soon be released. 
 In closing, I would like to take a moment to thank,one of my investors:,longtime TEDster, Jay Walker.,And I'd like to thank you all. 
 (Applause).

 ♫ Maybe mocking 'em in a song ♫Three years ago, I got a phone call, based on an earlier film I had made,,with an offer to embed the New Hampshire National Guard.,My idea -- and literally, I woke up in the middle of the night,,and we've all have those moments. You know, you go to sleep --,I was excited, with this phone call.,I was thinking, I just finished making another film about World War II vets,,and I realized I'd gotten to know their stories,,and I realized this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,to tell a warrior's story as it unfolded.,So I went to bed that night pretty excited.,Not sure of all the details, but excited.,It wasn't at four in the morning, but it was closer to midnight.,Woke straight up. Wide-awake as could be.,And I had this idea: what if I could, in effect, virtually embed,,and create a permeable relationship with the soldiers?,To tell the story from the inside out, versus the outside in? 
 So, I called back Major Heilshorn,,who's the public affairs officer of the New Hampshire National Guard.,And he knew me, so I was like, "Greg?",He's like, "Yes, Deborah?",Told him my idea, and you know,,he is one of the bravest men in the world,,as is General Blair, who, in the end, gave me permission to try this experiment. 
 Within 10 days, I was down at Fort Dix.,He gave me my pick of units.,I picked one unit -- Charlie Company, Third of the 172nd,,they're mountain infantry -- for two reasons.,One, they're infantry.,Number two, they were going to be based at LSA Anaconda,,so I knew they would have Internet access.,The caveat for my access was I had to get the soldiers to volunteer.,This was a big thing that,I think when Major H told me,,I wasn't really totally gathering what that would mean. 
 So what that meant was, when I went down to Fort Dix,,I had to hop out in front of 180 guys and tell them of my vision.,You can imagine the hailstorm of questions I got.,The opening one was,,"What the fuck do you know about the National Guard?",I started with the 1607 Massachusetts Bay Colony Pequot Indian Wars.,Gave them about a nine minute response,,and there we went. 
 So, I'd like to show the clip of the film.,It's our trailer, because I know, obviously you guys are busy,,many of you may not have had a chance to see it.,So, I want to show the trailer,,and then I'm going to take apart one scene in detail.,If we could roll? 
 (Video) Stephen Pink: This is Sergeant Stephen Pink. 
 Michael Moriarty: Specialist Michael Moriarty. 
 Zack Bazzi: Do I really want to go? Probably not. 
 Soldier: We're not supposed to talk to the media. 
 SP: I'm not the media, dammit! 
 MM: The day is here. Life will change. 
 Voice: The real deal, man! Narrator: You ready?,Soldier: Bring it on! Narrator: You ready? Voice 2: Iraq, here we come! 
 ZB: Every soldier eventually wants to go in combat.,It's natural instinct. 
 SP: If you let fear get to you,,then you're not going to be doing your job. 
 MM: Every single time you go out there, there's attacks.,It's unbelievable. 
 ZB: Hey, Nestor, your ass crack is right in my face. 
 Soldiers: IV! Are we on fire? IV!,Man down! Man down! 
 MM: Keep going, brother. You wanna play? 
 Michael Moriarty's Wife: It's really hard for him to not have his dad. 
 MM: This little kid is in the middle of a war zone. 
 Stephen Pink's Girlfriend: In the beginning, he's like, "Write something dirty!" 
 George W. Bush: The world's newest democracy. 
 MM: They're shooting at me. 
 SP: You don't put 150,000 troops in there,,and say we're there to create democracy. 
 Soldier: We've got a drive through window at Burger King now. 
 SP: We're here to create money. 
 MM: I support George Bush. We're not there for the oil. 
 Jon Baril: The worst thing in my life. 
 SP: Baril, don't look at it, bud. 
 Michael Moriarty's Wife: He's not the same person anymore. 
 MM: I will not go back. 
 Kevin Shangraw: The Iraqi people are who we are there to help --,and we just killed one. 
 Soldiers: Sergeant Smith is down! Sergeant Smith is down?,There they are! Right there! Fire, fire! 
 JB: It'll be a better country in 20 years, 'cause we were there.,I hope. 
 (Applause) Deborah Scranton: Thank you.,One of the things I'd like to talk to you about,is having a conversation about something that is difficult to talk about.,And I'd like to relate an experience I had here at TED.,I don't know how many of you might imagine it,,but there's actually a TEDster who recently got back from Iraq.,Paul? Come on, stand up.,This is Paul Anthony.,He served -- (Applause) -- with the Marines,,and I want to tell you a little, brief story.,We were one of the lucky ones,to get in the class with the Sony cameras and the Vista software.,Right? And we started talking.,People will see my tag, and they'll see "The War Tapes,",and then we'll start talking about war. 
 We got in a conversation with some other people in the class,,and it went on and on.,I mean, we were there for an hour, talking.,And it really highlighted something that I would like to ask,you guys to think about and hopefully to help with,,which is, I think a lot of us are very afraid to have conversations about war,,and about politics.,And really -- because maybe we're going to disagree.,Maybe it's going to get uncomfortable.,How do we open it up to really be able to have a conversation?,And you know, Paul was talking,,and he then turned to Constance and said,,"You know, I wouldn't have this conversation if she weren't here,,because I know she has my back." 
 And I want to say, I was nervous.,Because I'm used to doing Q&As.,I really related to what James was saying yesterday,,because I'm behind the camera.,You know, I can answer questions about my movie,,but for me to come up and talk for 18 minutes is a really long time.,So, I wanted to say, Paul, I'm happy you're here,,because I know you have my back. 
 This film was not about the Internet,,but it could not have been made without it.,The guys' tapes on average took two weeks to get from Iraq to me.,In the meantime, the soldiers -- we would email and IM.,I didn't save all of them,,because I didn't realize at the beginning,that it would be something that I would want to keep track of.,But there were 3,211 emails and IMs and text messages,that I was able to save.,The reason I quantify that is because we really embarked on this as a mutual journey,to really get inside of it.,So I wanted to show you a clip,,and then I was going tell you a little bit of how it got put together.,If we could roll the clip. 
 (Video) SP: Today is sport. [Unclear] Radio: [Unclear] Christian soldiers.,SP: We like to give these insurgents a fair chance.,So, what we do, we ride with the windows down.,Because, you know, we obviously have the advantage. I'm just kidding.,We don't fucking ride with the goddam windows down.,It's not true. Very unsafe.,Whoa. 
 Soldier: Right there. 
 SP: All right, let's get over to that site.,Be advised, we're leaving Taji right now.,We believe that the blast was right outside the gate of Taji,,we're heading to that location now. 
 Soldier: That's a fucking car bomb! 
 Soldier: Motherfuckers! 
 Soldiers: Get your vest on!,Hey, get over the fucking -- yeah, yeah.,Any one-four elements get to the gate! 
 SP: Sheriff one-six, or any one-four elements,,we need you at the gate of Taji right now, over. 
 Soldier: I'll walk you through it.,(Voices) 
 SP: Stay low. Head over to the right.,Get your bag, get your bag!,(Screams) 
 SP: It was mass casualties.,Probably 20 dead, at least 20 or 30 wounded Iraqis. 
 SP: It just looked like, you know,,someone had thrown a quarter through a guy,,and it was just like -- there was no blood coming from the shrapnel wounds.,Everything was cauterized,,and it was just like there was a void going through the body.,This is the scene north.,They just removed a burnt body, or half a body from here.,I don't think there was anything left from his abdominal down.,This is blood.,And you know, you walk,,and you hear the pieces of skin.,And that's it, that's all that's left.,I remember giving three IVs, bandaging several wounded.,Soldiers sitting in the corner of a sandbag wall, shaking and screaming.,Medics who were terrified and couldn't perform.,I later heard that Iraqi casualties were not to be treated in Taji.,They can work on the post for pennies, but can't die there.,They've got to die outside.,If one of those incompetent medical officers told me to stop treatment,,I would've slit his throat right there.,21:00 hours, and it's just our squad,going through today's events in our heads,,whether we want to or not. 
 News Anchor: More violence in Iraq.,Twin suicide car bombings killed eight Iraqis and wounded dozens more,near a coalition base north of Baghdad. 
 SP: We made the news.,I feel exploited and proud at the same time.,I've lost all faith in the media --,a hapless joke I would much rather laugh at than become a part of.,I should really thank God for saving my lucky ass.,I'll do that, then I'm gonna jerk off.,Because these pages smell like Linds,,and there won't be any time for jerking off tomorrow.,Another mission at 06:00. 
 DS: Now -- (Applause) -- thanks.,When I said earlier, to try and tell a story from the inside out, versus the outside in --,part of what Chris said so eloquently in his introduction -- is this melding.,It's a new way of trying to make a documentary.,When I met the guys, and 10 of them agreed to take cameras --,in total, 21 ended up filming.,Five soldiers filmed the entire time.,There are three featured in the film. 
 The way I learned about Taji was Steve Pink sent me an email,,and in it, attached a photo of that burned body out at the car.,And the tone from the email was,,you know, it had been a very bad day, obviously.,And I saw in my IM window that Mike Moriarty was at the base.,So, I pinged Mike and I said,,"Mike, can you please go get that interview with Pink?",Because the thing that very often is missing is,,in the military what they call "hot wash.",It's that immediate interview after something immediately happens, you know.,And if you let time go by,,it kind of softens and smooths the edges.,And for me, I really wanted that. 
 So, in order to get the intimacy,,to share that experience with you, the guys --,the two most popular mounts --,there was a camera on the turret, the gun turret,,and then on the dashboard of the Humvee.,Most of the Humvees, we ended up mounting two cameras in them.,So you get to experience that in real time, right?,The interview that you see is the one that Mike went and did,within 24 hours of that episode happening. 
 Steve Pink reading his journal,happened five months after he came home.,I knew about that journal, but it was very, very private.,And you know, you earn someone's trust,,especially in doc filmmaking, through your relationship.,So, it wasn't until five months after he was home,that he would read that journal. 
 Now, the news footage I put in there to try to show --,you know, I think mainstream media tries to do the best they can,in the format that they have.,But the thing that I know you all have heard a lot of times,,American soldiers saying,,"Why don't they talk about the good stuff that we do?",OK, this is a perfect example.,Pink's squad and another squad spent their entire day outside the wire.,They didn't have to go outside the wire.,There were not Americans hurt out there.,They spent their entire day outside the wire trying to save Iraqi lives --,the Iraqis who work on the post.,So, when you may hear soldiers complaining,,that's what they're talking about, you know?,And I think it's such an amazing gift that they would share this,as a way of bridging. 
 And when I talk about that polarity I get at so many different Q&As,,and people are really opinionated.,But it seems like people don't want to hear so much,,or listen, or try to have an exchange.,And I'm as fiery as the next person, but I really think --,you know, different speakers have talked about their concern for the world,,and my concern is that we have to have these conversations.,And we have to be able to go into scary places where we may, you know,,we think we know.,But we just have to leave that little bit of openness, to know.,There's such a disconnect.,And for me, it's trying to bridge that disconnect.,I'll share one story.,I get -- I'm often asked, you know, for me,,what have been some of the special moments from having worked on this film.,And at screenings, inevitably --,you know, as I'm sure all of you obviously do speaking stuff --,usually you have people who hang around and want to ask you more questions.,And usually, the first questions are,,"Oh, what kind of cameras did you use?",Or you know, these things. 
 But there's always a few guys, almost always, who are the last ones.,And I've learned over time that those are always the soldiers.,And they wait until pretty much everybody's gone.,And for me, one of the most profound stories someone shared with me,,that then became my story, was --,for those of you who haven't seen the film, and it's not a spoiler --,it's very common there are a lot of civilian accidents,,where people get in front of Humvees and they get killed.,In this film, there is a scene where an Iraqi woman is killed.,A soldier came up to me and stood, you know really, pretty close,,a foot away from me.,He's a big guy.,And he looked at me, and I smiled,,and then I saw the tears start welling up in his eyes.,And he wasn't going to blink.,And he said, "My gunner was throwing candy.",And I knew what he was going to say.,The gunner was throwing candy.,They used to throw candy to the kids.,Kids got too close, very often.,And he said, "I killed a child.,And I'm a father. I have children.,I haven't been able to tell my wife.,I'm afraid she's going to think I'm a monster.",I hugged him, of course,,and I said, you know, "It's going to be OK.",And he said, "I'm going to bring her to see your film.,And then I'm going to tell her." 
 So when I talk about a disconnect,,it's not only for maybe those people who don't know a soldier,,which there obviously are. You know, these days,,it's not like World War II, where there was a war front and a home front,,and everybody seemed involved.,You can go for days here and not feel like there's a war going on.,And often, I'll hear people say,,who maybe know that I did this film,,and they say, "Oh, you know, I'm against the war, but I support the soldiers.",And I've started to ask them,,"Well, that's nice. What are you doing?,Are you volunteering at a VA?,You go and see anybody?,Do you, if you find out your neighbor's been, do you spend some time?,Not necessarily ask questions, but see if they want to talk?,Do you give money to any of the charities?",You know, obviously, like Dean Kamen's working on that amazing thing,,but there's charities where you can sponsor computers for wounded soldiers. 
 I think, I challenge us to say --,to operationalize those terms, when we say we support someone, you know?,Are you a friend to them?,Do you really care?,And I would just say it's my hope, and I would ask you guys,to please, you know, reach out a hand.,And really do give them a hug.,Thank you.So I want to talk to you today about AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa.,And this is a pretty well-educated audience,,so I imagine you all know something about AIDS.,You probably know that roughly 25 million people in Africa,are infected with the virus, that AIDS is a disease of poverty,,and that if we can bring Africa out of poverty, we would decrease AIDS as well.,If you know something more, you probably know that Uganda, to date,,is the only country in sub-Saharan Africa,that has had success in combating the epidemic.,Using a campaign that encouraged people to abstain, be faithful, and use condoms --,the ABC campaign -- they decreased their prevalence in the 1990s,from about 15 percent to 6 percent over just a few years.,If you follow policy, you probably know that a few years ago,the president pledged 15 billion dollars to fight the epidemic over five years,,and a lot of that money is going to go to programs that try to replicate Uganda,and use behavior change to encourage people and decrease the epidemic. 
 So today I'm going to talk about some things,that you might not know about the epidemic,,and I'm actually also going to challenge,some of these things that you think that you do know.,To do that I'm going to talk about my research,as an economist on the epidemic.,And I'm not really going to talk much about the economy.,I'm not going to tell you about exports and prices.,But I'm going to use tools and ideas that are familiar to economists,to think about a problem that's more traditionally,part of public health and epidemiology.,And I think in that sense, this fits really nicely with this lateral thinking idea.,Here I'm really using the tools of one academic discipline,to think about problems of another. 
 So we think, first and foremost, AIDS is a policy issue.,And probably for most people in this room, that's how you think about it.,But this talk is going to be about understanding facts about the epidemic.,It's going to be about thinking about how it evolves, and how people respond to it.,I think it may seem like I'm ignoring the policy stuff,,which is really the most important,,but I'm hoping that at the end of this talk you will conclude,that we actually cannot develop effective policy,unless we really understand how the epidemic works. 
 And the first thing that I want to talk about,,the first thing I think we need to understand is:,how do people respond to the epidemic?,So AIDS is a sexually transmitted infection, and it kills you.,So this means that in a place with a lot of AIDS,,there's a really significant cost of sex.,If you're an uninfected man living in Botswana, where the HIV rate is 30 percent,,if you have one more partner this year -- a long-term partner, girlfriend, mistress --,your chance of dying in 10 years increases by three percentage points. 
 That is a huge effect.,And so I think that we really feel like then people should have less sex.,And in fact among gay men in the US,we did see that kind of change in the 1980s.,So if we look in this particularly high-risk sample, they're being asked,,"Did you have more than one unprotected sexual partner in the last two months?",Over a period from '84 to '88, that share drops from about 85 percent to 55 percent.,It's a huge change in a very short period of time. 
 We didn't see anything like that in Africa.,So we don't have quite as good data, but you can see here,the share of single men having pre-marital sex,,or married men having extra-marital sex,,and how that changes from the early '90s to late '90s,,and late '90s to early 2000s. The epidemic is getting worse.,People are learning more things about it.,We see almost no change in sexual behavior.,These are just tiny decreases -- two percentage points -- not significant. 
 This seems puzzling. But I'm going to argue that you shouldn't be surprised by this,,and that to understand this you need to think about health,the way than an economist does -- as an investment.,So if you're a software engineer and you're trying to think about,whether to add some new functionality to your program,,it's important to think about how much it costs.,It's also important to think about what the benefit is.,And one part of that benefit is how much longer,you think this program is going to be active.,If version 10 is coming out next week,,there's no point in adding more functionality into version nine. 
 But your health decisions are the same.,Every time you have a carrot instead of a cookie,,every time you go to the gym instead of going to the movies,,that's a costly investment in your health.,But how much you want to invest is going to depend,on how much longer you expect to live in the future,,even if you don't make those investments.,AIDS is the same kind of thing. It's costly to avoid AIDS.,People really like to have sex.,But, you know, it has a benefit in terms of future longevity.,But life expectancy in Africa, even without AIDS, is really, really low:,40 or 50 years in a lot of places.,I think it's possible, if we think about that intuition, and think about that fact,,that maybe that explains some of this low behavior change. 
 But we really need to test that.,And a great way to test that is to look across areas in Africa and see:,do people with more life expectancy change their sexual behavior more?,And the way that I'm going to do that is,,I'm going to look across areas with different levels of malaria.,So malaria is a disease that kills you.,It's a disease that kills a lot of adults in Africa, in addition to a lot of children.,And so people who live in areas with a lot of malaria,are going to have lower life expectancy than people who live in areas with limited malaria.,So one way to test to see whether we can explain,some of this behavior change by differences in life expectancy,is to look and see is there more behavior change,in areas where there's less malaria. 
 So that's what this figure shows you.,This shows you -- in areas with low malaria, medium malaria, high malaria --,what happens to the number of sexual partners as you increase HIV prevalence.,If you look at the blue line,,the areas with low levels of malaria, you can see in those areas,,actually, the number of sexual partners is decreasing a lot,as HIV prevalence goes up.,Areas with medium levels of malaria it decreases some --,it doesn't decrease as much. And areas with high levels of malaria --,actually, it's increasing a little bit, although that's not significant. 
 This is not just through malaria.,Young women who live in areas with high maternal mortality,change their behavior less in response to HIV,than young women who live in areas with low maternal mortality.,There's another risk, and they respond less to this existing risk. 
 So by itself, I think this tells a lot about how people behave.,It tells us something about why we see limited behavior change in Africa. 
 But it also tells us something about policy.,Even if you only cared about AIDS in Africa,,it might still be a good idea to invest in malaria,,in combating poor indoor air quality,,in improving maternal mortality rates.,Because if you improve those things,,then people are going to have an incentive to avoid AIDS on their own.,But it also tells us something about one of these facts that we talked about before.,Education campaigns, like the one that the president is focusing on in his funding,,may not be enough, at least not alone.,If people have no incentive to avoid AIDS on their own,,even if they know everything about the disease,,they still may not change their behavior. 
 So the other thing that I think we learn here is that AIDS is not going to fix itself.,People aren't changing their behavior enough,to decrease the growth in the epidemic.,So we're going to need to think about policy,and what kind of policies might be effective. 
 And a great way to learn about policy is to look at what worked in the past.,The reason that we know that the ABC campaign,was effective in Uganda is we have good data on prevalence over time.,In Uganda we see the prevalence went down.,We know they had this campaign. That's how we learn about what works.,It's not the only place we had any interventions.,Other places have tried things, so why don't we look at those places,and see what happened to their prevalence? 
 Unfortunately, there's almost no good data,on HIV prevalence in the general population in Africa until about 2003.,So if I asked you, "Why don't you go and find me,the prevalence in Burkina Faso in 1991?",You get on Google, you Google, and you find,,actually the only people tested in Burkina Faso in 1991,are STD patients and pregnant women,,which is not a terribly representative group of people.,Then if you poked a little more, you looked a little more at what was going on,,you'd find that actually that was a pretty good year,,because in some years the only people tested are IV drug users.,But even worse -- some years it's only IV drug users,,some years it's only pregnant women.,We have no way to figure out what happened over time.,We have no consistent testing. 
 Now in the last few years, we actually have done some good testing.,In Kenya, in Zambia, and a bunch of countries,,there's been testing in random samples of the population.,But this leaves us with a big gap in our knowledge.,So I can tell you what the prevalence was in Kenya in 2003,,but I can't tell you anything about 1993 or 1983. 
 So this is a problem for policy. It was a problem for my research.,And I started thinking about how else might we figure out,what the prevalence of HIV was in Africa in the past.,And I think that the answer is, we can look at mortality data,,and we can use mortality data to figure out what the prevalence was in the past. 
 To do this, we're going to have to rely on the fact,that AIDS is a very specific kind of disease.,It kills people in the prime of their lives.,Not a lot of other diseases have that profile. And you can see here --,this is a graph of death rates by age in Botswana and Egypt.,Botswana is a place with a lot of AIDS,,Egypt is a place without a lot of AIDS.,And you see they have pretty similar death rates among young kids and old people.,That suggests it's pretty similar levels of development. 
 But in this middle region, between 20 and 45,,the death rates in Botswana are much, much, much higher than in Egypt.,But since there are very few other diseases that kill people,,we can really attribute that mortality to HIV.,But because people who died this year of AIDS got it a few years ago,,we can use this data on mortality to figure out what HIV prevalence was in the past.,So it turns out, if you use this technique,,actually your estimates of prevalence are very close,to what we get from testing random samples in the population,,but they're very, very different than what UNAIDS tells us the prevalences are. 
 So this is a graph of prevalence estimated by UNAIDS,,and prevalence based on the mortality data,for the years in the late 1990s in nine countries in Africa.,You can see, almost without exception,,the UNAIDS estimates are much higher than the mortality-based estimates.,UNAIDS tell us that the HIV rate in Zambia is 20 percent,,and mortality estimates suggest it's only about 5 percent.,And these are not trivial differences in mortality rates.,So this is another way to see this.,You can see that for the prevalence to be as high as UNAIDS says,,we have to really see 60 deaths per 10,000,rather than 20 deaths per 10,000 in this age group. 
 I'm going to talk a little bit in a minute,about how we can use this kind of information to learn something,that's going to help us think about the world.,But this also tells us that one of these facts,that I mentioned in the beginning may not be quite right.,If you think that 25 million people are infected,,if you think that the UNAIDS numbers are much too high,,maybe that's more like 10 or 15 million.,It doesn't mean that AIDS isn't a problem. It's a gigantic problem.,But it does suggest that that number might be a little big.,What I really want to do, is I want to use this new data,to try to figure out what makes the HIV epidemic grow faster or slower. 
 And I said in the beginning, I wasn't going to tell you about exports.,When I started working on these projects,,I was not thinking at all about economics,,but eventually it kind of sucks you back in.,So I am going to talk about exports and prices.,And I want to talk about the relationship between economic activity,,in particular export volume, and HIV infections. 
 So obviously, as an economist, I'm deeply familiar,with the fact that development, that openness to trade,,is really good for developing countries.,It's good for improving people's lives.,But openness and inter-connectedness, it comes with a cost,when we think about disease. I don't think this should be a surprise.,On Wednesday, I learned from Laurie Garrett,that I'm definitely going to get the bird flu,,and I wouldn't be at all worried about that,if we never had any contact with Asia. 
 And HIV is actually particularly closely linked to transit.,The epidemic was introduced to the US,by actually one male steward on an airline flight,,who got the disease in Africa and brought it back.,And that was the genesis of the entire epidemic in the US.,In Africa, epidemiologists have noted for a long time,that truck drivers and migrants are more likely to be infected than other people.,Areas with a lot of economic activity --,with a lot of roads, with a lot of urbanization --,those areas have higher prevalence than others. 
 But that actually doesn't mean at all,that if we gave people more exports, more trade, that that would increase prevalence.,By using this new data, using this information about prevalence over time,,we can actually test that. And so it seems to be --,fortunately, I think -- it seems to be the case,that these things are positively related.,More exports means more AIDS. And that effect is really big.,So the data that I have suggests that if you double export volume,,it will lead to a quadrupling of new HIV infections. 
 So this has important implications both for forecasting and for policy.,From a forecasting perspective, if we know where trade is likely to change,,for example, because of the African Growth and Opportunities Act,or other policies that encourage trade,,we can actually think about which areas are likely to be heavily infected with HIV.,And we can go and we can try to have pre-emptive preventive measures there.,Likewise, as we're developing policies to try to encourage exports,,if we know there's this externality --,this extra thing that's going to happen as we increase exports --,we can think about what the right kinds of policies are. 
 But it also tells us something about one of these things that we think that we know.,Even though it is the case that poverty is linked to AIDS,,in the sense that Africa is poor and they have a lot of AIDS,,it's not necessarily the case that improving poverty -- at least in the short run,,that improving exports and improving development --,it's not necessarily the case that that's going to lead,to a decline in HIV prevalence. 
 So throughout this talk I've mentioned a few times,the special case of Uganda, and the fact that,it's the only country in sub-Saharan Africa with successful prevention.,It's been widely heralded.,It's been replicated in Kenya, and Tanzania, and South Africa and many other places.,But now I want to actually also question that.,Because it is true that there was a decline in prevalence,in Uganda in the 1990s. It's true that they had an education campaign.,But there was actually something else that happened in Uganda in this period. 
 There was a big decline in coffee prices.,Coffee is Uganda's major export.,Their exports went down a lot in the early 1990s -- and actually that decline lines up,really, really closely with this decline in new HIV infections.,So you can see that both of these series --,the black line is export value, the red line is new HIV infections --,you can see they're both increasing.,Starting about 1987 they're both going down a lot.,And then actually they track each other,a little bit on the increase later in the decade. 
 So if you combine the intuition in this figure,with some of the data that I talked about before,,it suggests that somewhere between 25 percent and 50 percent,of the decline in prevalence in Uganda,actually would have happened even without any education campaign. 
 But that's enormously important for policy.,We're spending so much money to try to replicate this campaign.,And if it was only 50 percent as effective as we think that it was,,then there are all sorts of other things,maybe we should be spending our money on instead.,Trying to change transmission rates by treating other sexually transmitted diseases.,Trying to change them by engaging in male circumcision.,There are tons of other things that we should think about doing.,And maybe this tells us that we should be thinking more about those things. 
 I hope that in the last 16 minutes I've told you something that you didn't know about AIDS,,and I hope that I've gotten you questioning a little bit,some of the things that you did know.,And I hope that I've convinced you maybe,that it's important to understand things about the epidemic,in order to think about policy. 
 But more than anything, you know, I'm an academic.,And when I leave here, I'm going to go back,and sit in my tiny office, and my computer, and my data.,And the thing that's most exciting about that,is every time I think about research, there are more questions.,There are more things that I think that I want to do.,And what's really, really great about being here,is I'm sure that the questions that you guys have,are very, very different than the questions that I think up myself.,And I can't wait to hear about what they are.,So thank you very much.Now, have any of y'all ever looked up this word?,You know, in a dictionary? (Laughter) Yeah, that's what I thought.,How about this word?,Here, I'll show it to you.,Lexicography: the practice of compiling dictionaries.,Notice -- we're very specific -- that word "compile.",The dictionary is not carved out of a piece of granite,,out of a lump of rock. It's made up of lots of little bits.,It's little discrete --,that's spelled D-I-S-C-R-E-T-E -- bits.,And those bits are words. 
 Now one of the perks of being a lexicographer --,besides getting to come to TED -- is that you get to say really fun words,,like lexicographical.,Lexicographical has this great pattern:,it's called a double dactyl. And just by saying double dactyl,,I've sent the geek needle all the way into the red. (Laughter) (Applause),But "lexicographical" is the same pattern as "higgledy-piggledy.",Right? It's a fun word to say,,and I get to say it a lot.,Now, one of the non-perks of being a lexicographer,is that people don't usually have a kind of warm, fuzzy, snuggly image of the dictionary.,Right? Nobody hugs their dictionaries.,But what people really often think about the dictionary is, they think more like this.,Just to let you know, I do not have a lexicographical whistle.,But people think that my job is to let the good words,make that difficult left-hand turn into the dictionary,,and keep the bad words out. 
 But the thing is, I don't want to be a traffic cop.,For one thing, I just do not do uniforms.,And for another, deciding what words are good,and what words are bad is actually not very easy.,And it's not very fun. And when parts of your job are not easy or fun,,you kind of look for an excuse not to do them.,So if I had to think of some kind of occupation,as a metaphor for my work, I would much rather be a fisherman.,I want to throw my big net into the deep, blue ocean of English,and see what marvelous creatures I can drag up from the bottom.,But why do people want me to direct traffic, when I would much rather go fishing?,Well, I blame the Queen.,Why do I blame the Queen?,Well, first of all, I blame the Queen because it's funny.,But secondly, I blame the Queen because,dictionaries have really not changed. 
 Our idea of what a dictionary is has not changed since her reign.,The only thing that Queen Victoria would not be amused by in modern dictionaries,is our inclusion of the F-word, which has happened,in American dictionaries since 1965.,So, there's this guy, right? Victorian era.,James Murray, first editor of the Oxford English Dictionary.,I do not have that hat. I wish I had that hat.,So he's really responsible for a lot of,what we consider modern in dictionaries today.,When a guy who looks like that, in that hat,,is the face of modernity, you have a problem.,And so, James Murray could get a job on any dictionary today.,There'd be virtually no learning curve. 
 And of course, a few of us are saying: okay, computers!,Computers! What about computers?,The thing about computers is, I love computers.,I mean, I'm a huge geek, I love computers.,I would go on a hunger strike before I let them take away Google Book Search from me.,But computers don't do much else other than,speed up the process of compiling dictionaries.,They don't change the end result.,Because what a dictionary is,,is it's Victorian design merged with a little bit of modern propulsion.,It's steampunk. What we have is an electric velocipede.,You know, we have Victorian design with an engine on it. That's all!,The design has not changed. 
 And OK, what about online dictionaries, right?,Online dictionaries must be different.,This is the Oxford English Dictionary Online, one of the best online dictionaries.,This is my favorite word, by the way.,Erinaceous: pertaining to the hedgehog family; of the nature of a hedgehog.,Very useful word. So, look at that.,Online dictionaries right now are paper thrown up on a screen.,This is flat. Look how many links there are in the actual entry: two!,Right? Those little buttons,,I had them all expanded except for the date chart.,So there's not very much going on here.,There's not a lot of clickiness.,And in fact, online dictionaries replicate,almost all the problems of print, except for searchability.,And when you improve searchability,,you actually take away the one advantage of print, which is serendipity.,Serendipity is when you find things you weren't looking for,,because finding what you are looking for is so damned difficult. 
 So -- (Laughter) (Applause) -- now, when you think about this,,what we have here is a ham butt problem.,Does everyone know the ham butt problem?,Woman's making a ham for a big, family dinner.,She goes to cut the butt off the ham and throw it away,,and she looks at this piece of ham and she's like,,"This is a perfectly good piece of ham. Why am I throwing this away?",She thought, "Well, my mom always did this.",So she calls up mom, and she says,,"Mom, why'd you cut the butt off the ham, when you're making a ham?",She says, "I don't know, my mom always did it!",So they call grandma, and grandma says,,"My pan was too small!" (Laughter) 
 So, it's not that we have good words and bad words.,We have a pan that's too small!,You know, that ham butt is delicious! There's no reason to throw it away.,The bad words -- see, when people think about a place,and they don't find a place on the map,,they think, "This map sucks!",When they find a nightspot or a bar, and it's not in the guidebook,,they're like, "Ooh, this place must be cool! It's not in the guidebook.",When they find a word that's not in the dictionary, they think,,"This must be a bad word." Why? It's more likely to be a bad dictionary.,Why are you blaming the ham for being too big for the pan?,So, you can't get a smaller ham.,The English language is as big as it is. 
 So, if you have a ham butt problem,,and you're thinking about the ham butt problem,,the conclusion that it leads you to is inexorable and counterintuitive:,paper is the enemy of words.,How can this be? I mean, I love books. I really love books.,Some of my best friends are books.,But the book is not the best shape for the dictionary.,Now they're going to think "Oh, boy.,People are going to take away my beautiful, paper dictionaries?",No. There will still be paper dictionaries.,When we had cars -- when cars became the dominant mode of transportation,,we didn't round up all the horses and shoot them.,You know, there're still going to be paper dictionaries,,but it's not going to be the dominant dictionary.,The book-shaped dictionary is not going to be the only shape,dictionaries come in. And it's not going to be,the prototype for the shapes dictionaries come in. 
 So, think about it this way: if you've got an artificial constraint,,artificial constraints lead to,arbitrary distinctions and a skewed worldview.,What if biologists could only study animals,that made people go, "Aww." Right?,What if we made aesthetic judgments about animals,,and only the ones we thought were cute were the ones that we could study?,We'd know a whole lot about charismatic megafauna,,and not very much about much else.,And I think this is a problem.,I think we should study all the words,,because when you think about words, you can make beautiful expressions,from very humble parts.,Lexicography is really more about material science.,We are studying the tolerances of the materials,that you use to build the structure of your expression:,your speeches and your writing. And then, often people say to me,,"Well, OK, how do I know that this word is real?",They think, "OK, if we think words are the tools,that we use to build the expressions of our thoughts,,how can you say that screwdrivers are better than hammers?,How can you say that a sledgehammer is better than a ball-peen hammer?",They're just the right tools for the job. 
 And so people say to me, "How do I know if a word is real?",You know, anybody who's read a children's book,knows that love makes things real.,If you love a word, use it. That makes it real.,Being in the dictionary is an artificial distinction.,It doesn't make a word any more real than any other way.,If you love a word, it becomes real.,So if we're not worrying about directing traffic,,if we've transcended paper, if we are worrying less,about control and more about description,,then we can think of the English language,as being this beautiful mobile.,And any time one of those little parts of the mobile changes,,is touched, any time you touch a word,,you use it in a new context, you give it a new connotation,,you verb it, you make the mobile move.,You didn't break it. It's just in a new position,,and that new position can be just as beautiful. 
 Now, if you're no longer a traffic cop --,the problem with being a traffic cop is,there can only be so many traffic cops in any one intersection,,or the cars get confused. Right?,But if your goal is no longer to direct the traffic,,but maybe to count the cars that go by, then more eyeballs are better.,You can ask for help!,If you ask for help, you get more done. And we really need help.,Library of Congress: 17 million books,,of which half are in English.,If only one out of every 10 of those books,had a word that's not in the dictionary in it,,that would be equivalent to more than two unabridged dictionaries. 
 And I find an un-dictionaried word --,a word like "un-dictionaried," for example --,in almost every book I read. What about newspapers?,Newspaper archive goes back to 1759,,58.1 million newspaper pages. If only one in 100,of those pages had an un-dictionaried word on it,,it would be an entire other OED.,That's 500,000 more words. So that's a lot.,And I'm not even talking about magazines. I'm not talking about blogs --,and I find more new words on BoingBoing in a given week,than I do Newsweek or Time.,There's a lot going on there. 
 And I'm not even talking about polysemy,,which is the greedy habit some words have of taking,more than one meaning for themselves.,So if you think of the word "set," a set can be a badger's burrow,,a set can be one of the pleats in an Elizabethan ruff,,and there's one numbered definition in the OED.,The OED has 33 different numbered definitions for set.,Tiny, little word, 33 numbered definitions.,One of them is just labeled "miscellaneous technical senses.",Do you know what that says to me?,That says to me, it was Friday afternoon and somebody wanted to go down the pub. (Laughter),That's a lexicographical cop out,,to say, "miscellaneous technical senses." 
 So, we have all these words, and we really need help!,And the thing is, we could ask for help --,asking for help's not that hard.,I mean, lexicography is not rocket science.,See, I just gave you a lot of words and a lot of numbers,,and this is more of a visual explanation.,If we think of the dictionary as being the map of the English language,,these bright spots are what we know about,,and the dark spots are where we are in the dark.,If that was the map of all the words in American English, we don't know very much.,And we don't even know the shape of the language.,If this was the dictionary -- if this was the map of American English --,look, we have a kind of lumpy idea of Florida,,but there's no California!,We're missing California from American English.,We just don't know enough, and we don't even know that we're missing California.,We don't even see that there's a gap on the map. 
 So again, lexicography is not rocket science.,But even if it were, rocket science is being done,by dedicated amateurs these days. You know?,It can't be that hard to find some words!,So, enough scientists in other disciplines,are really asking people to help, and they're doing a good job of it.,For instance, there's eBird, where amateur birdwatchers,can upload information about their bird sightings.,And then, ornithologists can go,and help track populations, migrations, etc. 
 And there's this guy, Mike Oates. Mike Oates lives in the U.K.,He's a director of an electroplating company.,He's found more than 140 comets.,He's found so many comets, they named a comet after him.,It's kind of out past Mars. It's a hike.,I don't think he's getting his picture taken there anytime soon.,But he found 140 comets without a telescope.,He downloaded data from the NASA SOHO satellite,,and that's how he found them.,If we can find comets without a telescope,,shouldn't we be able to find words? 
 Now, y'all know where I'm going with this.,Because I'm going to the Internet, which is where everybody goes.,And the Internet is great for collecting words,,because the Internet's full of collectors.,And this is a little-known technological fact about the Internet,,but the Internet is actually made up of words and enthusiasm.,And words and enthusiasm actually happen to be,the recipe for lexicography. Isn't that great?,So there are a lot of really good word-collecting sites out there right now,,but the problem with some of them is that they're not scientific enough.,They show the word, but they don't show any context.,Where did it come from? Who said it?,What newspaper was it in? What book? 
 Because a word is like an archaeological artifact.,If you don't know the provenance or the source of the artifact,,it's not science, it's a pretty thing to look at.,So a word without its source is like a cut flower.,You know, it's pretty to look at for a while, but then it dies.,It dies too fast.,So, this whole time I've been saying,,"The dictionary, the dictionary, the dictionary, the dictionary.",Not "a dictionary," or "dictionaries." And that's because,,well, people use the dictionary to stand for the whole language.,They use it synecdochically.,And one of the problems of knowing a word like "synecdochically",is that you really want an excuse to say "synecdochically.",This whole talk has just been an excuse to get me to the point,where I could say "synecdochically" to all of you.,So I'm really sorry. But when you use a part of something --,like the dictionary is a part of the language,,or a flag stands for the United States, it's a symbol of the country --,then you're using it synecdochically.,But the thing is, we could make the dictionary the whole language.,If we get a bigger pan, then we can put all the words in.,We can put in all the meanings.,Doesn't everyone want more meaning in their lives?,And we can make the dictionary not just be a symbol of the language --,we can make it be the whole language. 
 You see, what I'm really hoping for is that my son,,who turns seven this month -- I want him to barely remember,that this is the form factor that dictionaries used to come in.,This is what dictionaries used to look like.,I want him to think of this kind of dictionary as an eight-track tape.,It's a format that died because it wasn't useful enough.,It wasn't really what people needed.,And the thing is, if we can put in all the words,,no longer have that artificial distinction between good and bad,,we can really describe the language like scientists.,We can leave the aesthetic judgments to the writers and the speakers.,If we can do that, then I can spend all my time fishing,,and I don't have to be a traffic cop anymore.,Thank you very much for your kind attention.Welcome to "Five Dangerous ThingsnYou Should Let Your Children Do.",I don't have children.,I borrow my friends' children, so -- 
 (Laughter) 
 take all this advice with a grain of salt.,I'm Gever Tulley.,I'm a contract computernscientist by trade,,but I'm the founder of somethingncalled the Tinkering School.,It's a summer programnwhich aims to help kids,learn how to build the thingsnthat they think of.,So we build a lot of things,,and I do put power toolsninto the hands of second-graders.,So if you're thinking about sendingnyour kid to Tinkering School,,they do come back bruised,nscraped and bloody. 
 (Laughter) 
 You know, we live in a world,that's subjected to ever morenstringent child safety regulations.,There doesn't seem to benany limit on how crazy,child safety regulations can get.,We put suffocation warningsnon every piece of plastic film,manufactured in the United States,,or for sale with an itemnin the United States.,We put warnings on coffee cups,to tell us that the contents may be hot.,And we seem to think that any itemnsharper than a golf ball is too sharp,for children under the age of 10. 
 So where does this trend stop?,When we round every cornernand eliminate every sharp object,,every pokey bit in the world,,then the first time that kidsncome in contact with anything sharp,,or not made out of round plastic,,they'll hurt themselves with it.,So, as the boundariesnof what we determine as the safety zone,grow ever smaller,,we cut off our childrennfrom valuable opportunities,to learn how to interactnwith the world around them.,And despite all of our bestnefforts and intentions,,kids are always going to figure out,how to do the most dangerousnthing they can,,in whatever environment they can. 
 (Laughter) 
 So despite the provocative title,,this presentation is really about safety,,and about some simple thingsnthat we can do,to raise our kids to be creative,,confident and in controlnof the environment around them.,And what I now present to you,is an excerpt from a book in progress.,The book is called "50 Dangerous Things.",This is "Five Dangerous Things." 
 Thing number one: Play with fire.,Learning to control one of the mostnelemental forces in nature,is a pivotal momentnin any child's personal history.,Whether we remember it or not,,it's the first time we really get control,of one of these mysterious things.,These mysteries are only revealed,to those who get the opportunitynto play with it.,So, playing with fire.,This is like one of the great thingsnwe ever discovered, fire.,From playing with it, they learnnsome basic principles about fire,,about intake, combustion, exhaust.,These are the three workingnelements of fire,that you have to havenfor a good, controlled fire.,And you can think of the open-pitnfire as a laboratory.,You don't know what they're goingnto learn from playing with it.,Let them fool around with itnon their own terms and trust me,,they're going to learn things,that you can't get out of playingnwith Dora the Explorer toys. 
 (Laughter) 
 Number two: Own a pocketknife.,Pocketknives are kind of driftingnout of our cultural consciousness,,which I think is a terrible thing. 
 (Laughter) 
 Your first pocketknifenis like the first universal tool,that you're given.,You know, it's a spatula, it's a pry bar,,it's a screwdriver and it's a blade, yeah.,And it's a powerful and empowering tool.,And in a lot of culturesnthey give knives --,like, as soon as they'rentoddlers, they have knives.,These are Inuit childrenncutting whale blubber.,I first saw this in a CanadiannFilm Board film when I was 10,,and it left a lasting impression,,to see babies playing with knives.,And it shows that kids can developnan extended sense of self,through a tool at a very young age.,You lay down a couplenof very simple rules --,always cut away from your body,nkeep the blade sharp, never force it --,and these are things kidsncan understand and practice with.,And yeah, they're going to cut themselves.,I have some terrible scars on my legsnfrom where I stabbed myself.,But you know, they're young.nThey heal fast. 
 (Laughter) 
 Number three: Throw a spear.,It turns out that our brainsnare actually wired for throwing things,,and like muscles, if you don'tnuse parts of your brain,,they tend to atrophy over time.,But when you exercise them,,any given muscle adds strengthnto the whole system,,and that applies to your brain, too.,So practicing throwing thingsnhas been shown to stimulate,the frontal and parietal lobes,,which have to do withnvisual acuity, 3D understanding,,and structural problem solving,,so it helps develop their visualizationnskills and their predictive ability.,And throwing is a combinationnof analytical and physical skill,,so it's very good for that kindnof whole-body training.,These kinds of target-based practicesnalso help kids develop,attention and concentration skills,,so those are great. 
 Number [four]: Deconstruct appliances.,There is a world of interesting thingsninside your dishwasher.,Next time you're aboutnto throw out an appliance,,don't throw it out.,Take it apart with your kid,,or send him to my school,nand we'll take it apart with them.,Even if you don't know what the parts are,,puzzling out what they might be for,is a really good practice for the kids,to get sort of the sensenthat they can take things apart,,and no matter how complex they are,,they can understand parts of them.,And that means that eventually,nthey can understand all of them.,It's a sense of knowability,nthat something is knowable.,So these black boxes that we live withnand take for granted,are actually complex thingsnmade by other people,,and you can understand them. 
 Number five: Two-parter.,Break the DigitalnMillennium Copyright Act. 
 (Laughter) 
 There are laws beyond safety regulations,that attempt to limitnhow we can interact with the things,that we own -- in this case,ndigital media.,It's a very simple exercise:,Buy a song on iTunes, write it to a CD,,then rip the CD to an MP3,nand play it on your very same computer.,You've just broken a law.,Technically, the RIAAncould come and prosecute you.,It's an important lessonnfor kids to understand,,that some of these lawsnget broken by accident,,and that laws have to be interpreted.,That's something we oftenntalk about with the kids,when we're fooling around with thingsnand breaking them open,,and taking them apartnand using them for other things.,And also when we go out and drive a car.,Driving a car is a really empowering actnfor a young child,,so this is the alternate -- 
 (Laughter) 
 For those of you who aren't comfortablenactually breaking the law,,you can drive a car with your child.,This is a great stage for a kid.,This happens about the same time,that they get latched ontonthings like dinosaurs,,these big things in the outside world,,that they're trying to get a grip on.,A car is a similar object,nand they can get in a car and drive it.,And that really gives themna handle on a world,in a way that they don't oftennhave access to.,And it's perfectly legal.,Find a big empty lot,nmake sure there's nothing in it,,and that it's on private property,nand let them drive your car.,It's very safe actually.,And it's fun for the whole family. 
 (Laughter) 
 Let's see, I think that's it.nThat's number five and a half. OK.I told you three things last year.,I told you that the statistics of the world,have not been made properly available.,Because of that, we still have the old mindset,of developing in industrialized countries, which is wrong.,And that animated graphics can make a difference.,Things are changing,and today, on the United Nations Statistic Division Home Page,,it says, by first of May, full access to the databases.,(Applause),And if I could share the image with you on the screen.,So three things have happened.,U.N. opened their statistic databases,,and we have a new version of the software,up working as a beta on the net,,so you don't have to download it any longer. 
 And let me repeat what you saw last year.,The bubbles are the countries.,Here you have the fertility rate -- the number of children per woman --,and there you have the length of life in years.,This is 1950 -- those were the industrialized countries,,those were developing countries.,At that time there was a "we" and "them.",There was a huge difference in the world.,But then it changed, and it went on quite well. 
 And this is what happens.,You can see how China is the red, big bubble.,The blue there is India.,And they go over all this -- I'm going to try to be,a little more serious this year in showing you,how things really changed.,And it's Africa that stands out as the problem down here, doesn't it?,Large families still, and the HIV epidemic,brought down the countries like this.,This is more or less what we saw last year,,and this is how it will go on into the future. 
 And I will talk on, is this possible?,Because you see now, I presented statistics that don't exist.,Because this is where we are.,Will it be possible that this will happen?,I cover my lifetime here, you know?,I expect to live 100 years.,And this is where we are today.,Now could we look here instead at the economic situation in the world?,And I would like to show that against child survival.,We'll swap the axis.,Here you have child mortality -- that is, survival --,four kids dying there, 200 dying there.,And this is GDP per capita on this axis.,And this was 2007. 
 And if I go back in time, I've added some historical statistics --,here we go, here we go, here we go -- not so much statistics 100 years ago.,Some countries still had statistics.,We are looking down in the archive,,and when we are down into 1820,,there is only Austria and Sweden that can produce numbers.,(Laughter),But they were down here. They had 1,000 dollars per person per year.,And they lost one-fifth of their kids before their first birthday. 
 So this is what happens in the world, if we play the entire world.,How they got slowly richer and richer,,and they add statistics.,Isn't it beautiful when they get statistics?,You see the importance of that?,And here, children don't live longer.,The last century, 1870, was bad for the kids in Europe,,because most of this statistics is Europe.,It was only by the turn of the century,that more than 90 percent of the children survived their first year.,This is India coming up, with the first data from India.,And this is the United States moving away here, earning more money.,And we will soon see China coming up in the very far end corner here.,And it moves up with Mao Tse-Tung getting health,,not getting so rich.,There he died, then Deng Xiaoping brings money.,It moves this way over here.,And the bubbles keep moving up there,,and this is what the world looks like today.,(Applause) 
 Let us have a look at the United States.,We have a function here -- I can tell the world, "Stay where you are.",And I take the United States -- we still want to see the background --,I put them up like this, and now we go backwards.,And we can see that the United States,goes to the right of the mainstream.,They are on the money side all the time.,And down in 1915, the United States was a neighbor of India --,present, contemporary India.,And that means United States was richer,,but lost more kids than India is doing today, proportionally.,And look here -- compare to the Philippines of today.,The Philippines of today has almost the same economy,as the United States during the First World War.,But we have to bring United States forward quite a while,to find the same health of the United States,as we have in the Philippines.,About 1957 here, the health of the United States,is the same as the Philippines.,And this is the drama of this world which many call globalized,,is that Asia, Arabic countries, Latin America,,are much more ahead in being healthy, educated,,having human resources than they are economically. 
 There's a discrepancy in what's happening today,in the emerging economies.,There now, social benefits, social progress,,are going ahead of economical progress.,And 1957 -- the United States had the same economy as Chile has today.,And how long do we have to bring United States,to get the same health as Chile has today?,I think we have to go, there -- we have 2001, or 2002 --,the United States has the same health as Chile.,Chile's catching up!,Within some years Chile may have better child survival,than the United States.,This is really a change, that you have this lag,of more or less 30, 40 years' difference on the health. 
 And behind the health is the educational level.,And there's a lot of infrastructure things,,and general human resources are there.,Now we can take away this --,and I would like to show you the rate of speed,,the rate of change, how fast they have gone.,And we go back to 1920, and I want to look at Japan.,And I want to look at Sweden and the United States.,And I'm going to stage a race here,between this sort of yellowish Ford here,and the red Toyota down there,,and the brownish Volvo.,(Laughter),And here we go. Here we go.,The Toyota has a very bad start down here, you can see,,and the United States Ford is going off-road there.,And the Volvo is doing quite fine.,This is the war. The Toyota got off track, and now,the Toyota is coming on the healthier side of Sweden --,can you see that?,And they are taking over Sweden,,and they are now healthier than Sweden.,That's the part where I sold the Volvo and bought the Toyota.,(Laughter),And now we can see that the rate of change was enormous in Japan.,They really caught up. 
 And this changes gradually.,We have to look over generations to understand it.,And let me show you my own sort of family history --,we made these graphs here.,And this is the same thing, money down there, and health, you know?,And this is my family.,This is Sweden, 1830, when my great-great-grandma was born.,Sweden was like Sierra Leone today.,And this is when great-grandma was born, 1863.,And Sweden was like Mozambique.,And this is when my grandma was born, 1891.,She took care of me as a child,,so I'm not talking about statistic now --,now it's oral history in my family.,That's when I believe statistics,,when it's grandma-verified statistics.,(Laughter),I think it's the best way of verifying historical statistics.,Sweden was like Ghana.,It's interesting to see the enormous diversity,within sub-Saharan Africa.,I told you last year, I'll tell you again,,my mother was born in Egypt, and I -- who am I?,I'm the Mexican in the family.,And my daughter, she was born in Chile,,and the grand-daughter was born in Singapore,,now the healthiest country on this Earth.,It bypassed Sweden about two to three years ago,,with better child survival.,But they're very small, you know?,They're so close to the hospital we can never,beat them out in these forests.,(Laughter),But homage to Singapore. 
 Singapore is the best one.,Now this looks also like a very good story.,But it's not really that easy, that it's all a good story.,Because I have to show you one of the other facilities.,We can also make the color here represent the variable --,and what am I choosing here?,Carbon-dioxide emission, metric ton per capita.,This is 1962, and United States was emitting 16 tons per person.,And China was emitting 0.6,,and India was emitting 0.32 tons per capita.,And what happens when we moved on?,Well, you see the nice story of getting richer,and getting healthier --,everyone did it at the cost of emission of carbon dioxide.,There is no one who has done it so far.,And we don't have all the updated data,any longer, because this is really hot data today.,And there we are, 2001. 
 And in the discussion I attended with global leaders, you know,,many say now the problem is that the emerging economies,,they are getting out too much carbon dioxide.,The Minister of the Environment of India said,,"Well, you were the one who caused the problem.",The OECD countries -- the high-income countries --,they were the ones who caused the climate change.,"But we forgive you, because you didn't know it.,But from now on, we count per capita.,From now on we count per capita.,And everyone is responsible for the per capita emission." 
 This really shows you, we have not seen good economic,and health progress anywhere in the world,without destroying the climate.,And this is really what has to be changed.,I've been criticized for showing you a too positive image of the world,,but I don't think it's like this.,The world is quite a messy place.,This we can call Dollar Street.,Everyone lives on this street here.,What they earn here -- what number they live on --,is how much they earn per day.,This family earns about one dollar per day.,We drive up the street here,,we find a family here which earns about two to three dollars a day.,And we drive away here -- we find the first garden in the street,,and they earn 10 to 50 dollars a day. 
 And how do they live?,If we look at the bed here, we can see,that they sleep on a rug on the floor.,This is what poverty line is --,80 percent of the family income is just to cover the energy needs,,the food for the day.,This is two to five dollars. You have a bed.,And here it's a much nicer bedroom, you can see.,I lectured on this for Ikea, and they wanted to see,the sofa immediately here.,(Laughter),And this is the sofa, how it will emerge from there.,And the interesting thing, when you go around here in the photo panorama,,you see the family still sitting on the floor there.,Although there is a sofa,,if you watch in the kitchen, you can see that,the great difference for women does not come between one to 10 dollars.,It comes beyond here, when you really can get,good working conditions in the family.,And if you really want to see the difference,,you look at the toilet over here.,This can change. This can change.,These are all pictures and images from Africa,,and it can become much better.,We can get out of poverty. 
 My own research has not been in IT or anything like this.,I spent 20 years in interviews with African farmers,who were on the verge of famine.,And this is the result of the farmers-needs research.,The nice thing here is that you can't see,who are the researchers in this picture.,That's when research functions in poor societies --,you must really live with the people. 
 When you're in poverty, everything is about survival.,It's about having food.,And these two young farmers, they are girls now --,because the parents are dead from HIV and AIDS --,they discuss with a trained agronomist.,This is one of the best agronomists in Malawi, Junatambe Kumbira,,and he's discussing what sort of cassava they will plant --,the best converter of sunshine to food that man has found.,And they are very, very eagerly interested to get advice,,and that's to survive in poverty.,That's one context.,Getting out of poverty.,The women told us one thing. "Get us technology.,We hate this mortar, to stand hours and hours.,Get us a mill so that we can mill our flour,,then we will be able to pay for the rest ourselves.",Technology will bring you out of poverty,,but there's a need for a market to get away from poverty.,And this woman is very happy now, bringing her products to the market.,But she's very thankful for the public investment in schooling,so she can count, and won't be cheated when she reaches the market.,She wants her kid to be healthy, so she can go to the market,and doesn't have to stay home.,And she wants the infrastructure -- it is nice with a paved road.,It's also good with credit.,Micro-credits gave her the bicycle, you know.,And information will tell her when to go to market with which product.,You can do this. 
 I find my experience from 20 years of Africa is that,the seemingly impossible is possible.,Africa has not done bad.,In 50 years they've gone from a pre-Medieval situation,to a very decent 100-year-ago Europe,,with a functioning nation and state.,I would say that sub-Saharan Africa has done best in the world,during the last 50 years.,Because we don't consider where they came from.,It's this stupid concept of developing countries,that puts us, Argentina and Mozambique together 50 years ago,,and says that Mozambique did worse.,We have to know a little more about the world.,I have a neighbor who knows 200 types of wine.,He knows everything.,He knows the name of the grape, the temperature and everything.,I only know two types of wine -- red and white.,(Laughter),But my neighbor only knows two types of countries --,industrialized and developing.,And I know 200, I know about the small data.,But you can do that.,(Applause) 
 But I have to get serious. And how do you get serious?,You make a PowerPoint, you know?,(Laughter),Homage to the Office package, no?,What is this, what is this, what am I telling?,I'm telling you that there are many dimensions of development.,Everyone wants your pet thing.,If you are in the corporate sector, you love micro-credit.,If you are fighting in a non-governmental organization,,you love equity between gender.,Or if you are a teacher, you'll love UNESCO, and so on.,On the global level, we have to have more than our own thing.,We need everything.,All these things are important for development,,especially when you just get out of poverty,and you should go towards welfare. 
 Now, what we need to think about,is, what is a goal for development,,and what are the means for development?,Let me first grade what are the most important means.,Economic growth to me, as a public-health professor,,is the most important thing for development,because it explains 80 percent of survival.,Governance. To have a government which functions --,that's what brought California out of the misery of 1850.,It was the government that made law function finally.,Education, human resources are important.,Health is also important, but not that much as a mean.,Environment is important.,Human rights is also important, but it just gets one cross. 
 Now what about goals? Where are we going toward?,We are not interested in money.,Money is not a goal.,It's the best mean, but I give it zero as a goal.,Governance, well it's fun to vote in a little thing,,but it's not a goal.,And going to school, that's not a goal, it's a mean.,Health I give two points. I mean it's nice to be healthy,-- at my age especially -- you can stand here, you're healthy.,And that's good, it gets two plusses.,Environment is very, very crucial.,There's nothing for the grandkid if you don't save up.,But where are the important goals?,Of course, it's human rights.,Human rights is the goal,,but it's not that strong of a mean for achieving development.,And culture. Culture is the most important thing, I would say,,because that's what brings joy to life.,That's the value of living. 
 So the seemingly impossible is possible.,Even African countries can achieve this.,And I've shown you the shot where the seemingly impossible is possible.,And remember, please remember my main message,,which is this: the seemingly impossible is possible.,We can have a good world.,I showed you the shots, I proved it in the PowerPoint,,and I think I will convince you also by culture.,(Laughter),(Applause),Bring me my sword!,Sword swallowing is from ancient India.,It's a cultural expression that for thousands of years,has inspired human beings to think beyond the obvious.,(Laughter),And I will now prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible,by taking this piece of steel -- solid steel --,this is the army bayonet from the Swedish Army, 1850,,in the last year we had war.,And it's all solid steel -- you can hear here.,And I'm going to take this blade of steel,,and push it down through my body of blood and flesh,,and prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible.,Can I request a moment of absolute silence?,(Applause)Thank you so much. It's really scary to be here,among the smartest of the smart.,I'm here to tell you a few tales of passion.,There's a Jewish saying that I love.,What is truer than truth? Answer: The story.,I'm a storyteller. I want to convey something that is truer than truth,about our common humanity.,All stories interest me, and some haunt me,until I end up writing them.,Certain themes keep coming up:,justice, loyalty, violence, death, political and social issues,,freedom.,I'm aware of the mystery around us,,so I write about coincidences, premonitions,,emotions, dreams, the power of nature, magic. 
 In the last 20 years I have published a few books,,but I have lived in anonymity until February of 2006,,when I carried the Olympic flag in the Winter Olympics in Italy.,That made me a celebrity. Now people recognize me in Macy's,,and my grandchildren think that I'm cool.,(Laughter),Allow me to tell you about my four minutes of fame.,One of the organizers of the Olympic ceremony,,of the opening ceremony,,called me and said that I had been selected,to be one of the flag-bearers.,I replied that surely this was a case of mistaken identity,because I'm as far as you can get from being an athlete.,Actually, I wasn't even sure that I could go around the stadium,without a walker.,(Laughter),I was told that this was no laughing matter.,This would be the first time,that only women would carry the Olympic flag.,Five women, representing five continents,,and three Olympic gold medal winners.,My first question was, naturally,,what was I going to wear?,(Laughter),A uniform, she said,,and asked for my measurements.,My measurements.,I had a vision of myself in a fluffy anorak,,looking like the Michelin Man.,(Laughter) 
 By the middle of February,,I found myself in Turin, where enthusiastic crowds,cheered when any of the 80 Olympic teams was in the street.,Those athletes had sacrificed everything to compete in the games.,They all deserved to win, but there's the element of luck.,A speck of snow, an inch of ice, the force of the wind,,can determine the result of a race or a game.,However, what matters most -- more than training or luck -- is the heart.,Only a fearless and determined heart will get the gold medal.,It is all about passion.,The streets of Turin were covered with red posters,announcing the slogan of the Olympics. 
 Passion lives here. Isn't it always true?,Heart is what drives us and determines our fate.,That is what I need for my characters in my books:,a passionate heart.,I need mavericks, dissidents, adventurers, outsiders and rebels,,who ask questions, bend the rules and take risks.,People like all of you in this room.,Nice people with common sense do not make interesting characters.,(Laughter),They only make good former spouses.,(Laughter),(Applause) 
 In the green room of the stadium, I met the other flag bearers:,three athletes, and the actresses Susan Sarandon and Sophia Loren.,Also, two women with passionate hearts:,Wangari Maathai, the Nobel prizewinner from Kenya,who has planted 30 million trees. And by doing so,,she has changed the soil, the weather,,in some places in Africa, and of course,the economic conditions in many villages.,And Somaly Mam, a Cambodian activist who fights passionately,against child prostitution.,When she was 14 years old, her grandfather sold her to a brothel.,She told us of little girls raped by men who believe that,having sex with a very young virgin will cure them from AIDS.,And of brothels where children are forced to receive five,,15 clients per day,,and if they rebel, they are tortured with electricity.,In the green room I received my uniform.,It was not the kind of outfit that I normally wear,,but it was far from the Michelin Man suit,that I had anticipated. Not bad, really.,I looked like a refrigerator.,(Laughter),But so did most of the flag-bearers, except Sophia Loren,,the universal symbol of beauty and passion.,Sophia is over 70 and she looks great.,She's sexy, slim and tall, with a deep tan.,Now, how can you have a deep tan and have no wrinkles?,I don't know.,When asked in a TV interview, "How could she look so good?",She replied, "Posture. My back is always straight,,and I don't make old people's noises.",(Laughter),So, there you have some free advice,from one of the most beautiful women on earth.,No grunting, no coughing, no wheezing,,no talking to yourselves, no farting.,(Laughter),Well, she didn't say that exactly.,(Laughter) 
 At some point around midnight,,we were summoned to the wings of the stadium,,and the loudspeakers announced the Olympic flag, and the music started --,by the way, the same music that starts here,,the Aida March.,Sophia Loren was right in front of me -- she's a foot taller than I am,,not counting the poofy hair.,(Laughter),She walked elegantly, like a giraffe on the African savannah,,holding the flag on her shoulder. I jogged behind,(Laughter),-- on my tiptoes -- holding the flag on my extended arm,,so that my head was actually under the damn flag.,(Laughter),All the cameras were, of course, on Sophia.,That was fortunate for me, because in most press photos,I appear too, although often between Sophia's legs.,(Laughter),A place where most men would love to be.,(Laughter),(Applause) 
 The best four minutes of my entire life,were those in the Olympic stadium.,My husband is offended when I say this --,although I have explained to him that what we do in private,usually takes less than four minutes --,(Laughter),-- so he shouldn't take it personally.,I have all the press clippings of those four magnificent minutes,,because I don't want to forget them,when old age destroys my brain cells. 
 I want to carry in my heart forever the key word of the Olympics --,passion.,So here's a tale of passion.,The year is 1998, the place is a prison camp,for Tutsi refugees in Congo.,By the way, 80 percent of all refugees and displaced people in the world,are women and girls.,We can call this place in Congo a death camp,,because those who are not killed will die of disease or starvation.,The protagonists of this story,are a young woman, Rose Mapendo, and her children.,She's pregnant and a widow.,Soldiers have forced her to watch,as her husband was tortured and killed.,Somehow she manages to keep her seven children alive,,and a few months later, she gives birth to premature twins.,Two tiny little boys.,She cuts the umbilical cord with a stick,,and ties it with her own hair.,She names the twins after the camp's commanders,to gain their favor, and feeds them with black tea,because her milk cannot sustain them.,When the soldiers burst in her cell to rape her oldest daughter,,she grabs hold of her and refuses to let go,,even when they hold a gun to her head.,Somehow, the family survives for 16 months,,and then, by extraordinary luck, and the passionate heart,of a young American man, Sasha Chanoff,,who manages to put her in a U.S. rescue plane,,Rose Mapendo and her nine children end up in Phoenix, Arizona,,where they're now living and thriving. 
 Mapendo, in Swahili, means great love.,The protagonists of my books are strong and passionate women,like Rose Mapendo.,I don't make them up. There's no need for that.,I look around and I see them everywhere.,I have worked with women and for women all my life.,I know them well.,I was born in ancient times, at the end of the world,,in a patriarchal Catholic and conservative family.,No wonder that by age five I was a raging feminist --,although the term had not reached Chile yet,,so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me.,(Laughter),I would soon find out that there was a high price to pay,for my freedom, and for questioning the patriarchy.,But I was happy to pay it, because for every blow that I received,,I was able to deliver two.,(Laughter),Once, when my daughter Paula was in her twenties,,she said to me that feminism was dated, that I should move on.,We had a memorable fight. Feminism is dated?,Yes, for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today,,but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world,who are still forced into premature marriage,,prostitution, forced labor --,they have children that they don't want or they cannot feed.,They have no control over their bodies or their lives.,They have no education and no freedom.,They are raped, beaten up and sometimes killed with impunity.,For most Western young women of today,,being called a feminist is an insult.,Feminism has never been sexy, but let me assure you,that it never stopped me from flirting,,and I have seldom suffered from lack of men.,(Laughter),Feminism is not dead, by no means.,It has evolved. If you don't like the term,,change it, for Goddess' sake.,Call it Aphrodite, or Venus, or bimbo, or whatever you want;,the name doesn't matter,,as long as we understand what it is about, and we support it. 
 So here's another tale of passion, and this is a sad one.,The place is a small women's clinic in a village in Bangladesh.,The year is 2005.,Jenny is a young American dental hygienist,who has gone to the clinic as a volunteer,during her three-week vacation.,She's prepared to clean teeth,,but when she gets there, she finds out that there are no doctors,,no dentists, and the clinic is just a hut full of flies.,Outside, there is a line of women,who have waited several hours to be treated.,The first patient is in excruciating pain,because she has several rotten molars.,Jenny realizes that the only solution is to pull out the bad teeth.,She's not licensed for that; she has never done it.,She risks a lot and she's terrified.,She doesn't even have the proper instruments,,but fortunately she has brought some Novocaine.,Jenny has a brave and passionate heart.,She murmurs a prayer and she goes ahead with the operation.,At the end, the relieved patient kisses her hands.,That day the hygienist pulls out many more teeth.,The next morning, when she comes again to the so-called clinic,,her first patient is waiting for her with her husband.,The woman's face looks like a watermelon.,It is so swollen that you can't even see the eyes.,The husband, furious, threatens to kill the American.,Jenny is horrified at what she has done,,but then the translator explains,that the patient's condition has nothing to do with the operation.,The day before, her husband beat her up because she was not home,in time to prepare dinner for him. 
 Millions of women live like this today.,They are the poorest of the poor.,Although women do two-thirds of the world's labor,,they own less than one percent of the world's assets.,They are paid less than men for the same work,if they're paid at all, and they remain vulnerable,because they have no economic independence,,and they are constantly threatened by exploitation,,violence and abuse.,It is a fact that giving women education, work,,the ability to control their own income,,inherit and own property, benefits the society.,If a woman is empowered,,her children and her family will be better off.,If families prosper, the village prospers,,and eventually so does the whole country. 
 Wangari Maathai goes to a village in Kenya.,She talks with the women and explains that the land is barren,because they have cut and sold the trees.,She gets the women to plant new trees and water them,,drop by drop.,In a matter of five or six years, they have a forest,,the soil is enriched, and the village is saved.,The poorest and most backward societies,are always those that put women down.,Yet this obvious truth is ignored by governments,and also by philanthropy.,For every dollar given to a women's program,,20 dollars are given to men's programs.,Women are 51 percent of humankind.,Empowering them will change everything --,more than technology and design and entertainment.,I can promise you that women working together --,linked, informed and educated --,can bring peace and prosperity to this forsaken planet.,In any war today, most of the casualties are civilians,,mainly women and children. They are collateral damage.,Men run the world, and look at the mess we have. 
 What kind of world do we want?,This is a fundamental question that most of us are asking.,Does it make sense to participate in the existing world order?,We want a world where life is preserved,and the quality of life is enriched for everybody,,not only for the privileged.,In January I saw an exhibit of Fernando Botero's paintings,at the UC Berkeley library.,No museum or gallery in the United States,,except for the New York gallery that carries Botero's work,,has dared to show the paintings because the theme,is the Abu Ghraib prison.,They are huge paintings of torture and abuse of power,,in the voluminous Botero style.,I have not been able to get those images out of my mind,or my heart.,What I fear most is power with impunity.,I fear abuse of power, and the power to abuse.,In our species, the alpha males define reality,,and force the rest of the pack to accept that reality,and follow the rules.,The rules change all the time, but they always benefit them,,and in this case, the trickle-down effect,,which does not work in economics, works perfectly.,Abuse trickles down from the top of the ladder to the bottom.,Women and children, especially the poor, are at the bottom.,Even the most destitute of men have someone they can abuse --,a woman or a child.,I'm fed up with the power that a few exert over the many,through gender, income, race, and class. 
 I think that the time is ripe to make fundamental changes,in our civilization.,But for real change, we need feminine energy,in the management of the world.,We need a critical number of women in positions of power,,and we need to nurture the feminine energy in men.,I'm talking about men with young minds, of course.,Old guys are hopeless; we have to wait for them to die off.,(Laughter),Yes, I would love to have Sophia Loren's long legs,and legendary breasts.,But given a choice, I would rather have the warrior hearts,of Wangari Maathai, Somaly Mam, Jenny and Rose Mapendo.,I want to make this world good.,Not better, but to make it good.,Why not? It is possible. Look around in this room --,all this knowledge, energy, talent and technology.,Let's get off our fannies, roll up our sleeves,and get to work, passionately,,in creating an almost perfect world.,Thank you.Here's my thing.,Hold on. There I go. Hey.,I want to start today --ntalk about the structure of a polypeptide. 
 (Laughter) 
 I get a lot of people asking me,nin terms of "Lost," you know,,"What the hell's that island?",You know, it's usually followed by,,"No, seriously,nwhat the hell is that island?" 
 Why so many mysteries?,What is it about mysterynthat I seem to be drawn to?,And I was thinking about this,nwhat to talk about at TED.,When I talked to the kind rep from TED,,and I said, "Listen, you know,nwhat should I talk about?",He said, "Don't worry about it.nJust be profound." 
 (Laughter) 
 And I took enormous comfort in that.,So thank you, if you're here. 
 I was trying to think,nwhat do I talk about? Good question.,Why do I do so muchnstuff that involves mystery?,And I started trying to figure it out.,And I started thinkingnabout why do I do any of what I do,,and I started thinkingnabout my grandfather.,I loved my grandfather.,Harry Kelvin was his name,nmy mother's father.,He died in 1986. He was an amazing guy.,And one of the reasons he was amazing:,After World War II,nhe began an electronics company.,He started selling surplus parts,nkits, to schools and stuff.,So he had this incredible curiosity.,As a kid, I saw him come over to me,with radios and telephonesnand all sorts of things.,And he'd open them up, he'd unscrew themnand reveal the inner workings --,which many of us,nI'm sure, take for granted.,But it's an amazing gift to give a kid.,To open up this thingnand show how it works,and why it works and what it is.,He was the ultimatendeconstructor, in many ways.,And my grandfather was a kind of guynwho would not only take things apart,,but he got me interestednin all sorts of different odd crafts,,like, you know, printing,nlike the letter press.,I'm obsessed with printing.,I'm obsessed with silk-screeningnand bookbinding and box making.,When I was a kid, I was always,nlike, taking apart boxes and stuff. 
 And last night in the hotel,nI took apart the Kleenex box.,I was just looking at it.nAnd I'm telling you -- 
 (Laughter) 
 It's a beautiful thing. I swear to God.,I mean, when you look at the boxnand you sort of see how it works.,Rives is here, and I met himnyears ago at a book fair;,he does pop-up books.,And I'm obsessednwith engineering of paper.,The scoring of it, the printing of it,,where the thing gets glued,nthe registration marks for the ink.,I just love boxes.,My grandfather was the guy,who kind of got meninto all sorts of these things.,He would also supply me with tools.,He was this amazing encourager --nthis patron, sort of, to make stuff.,And he got me a Super 8 cameranwhen I was 10 years old.,And in 1976, that was sort of an anomaly,,to be a 10-year-old kidnthat had access to a camera.,And you know, he was so generous;nI couldn't believe it.,He wasn't doing itnentirely without some manipulation.,I mean, I would call him, and I'd be like,,"Listen, Grandpa,nI really need this camera.,You don't understand.nThis is, like, I want to make movies.,I'll get invited to TED one day --" 
 (Laughter) 
 And, you know, my grandmothernwas the greatest.,Because she'd be like, you know --nshe'd get on the phone.,She'd be like, "Harry,nit's better than the drugs.,She was fantastic.,So I found myself getting this stuff,nthanks to her assist,,and suddenly, you know,,I had a synthesizernwhen I was 14 years old --,this kind of stuff.,And it let me make things,nwhich, to me, was sort of the dream.,He sort of humored my obsessionnto other things too, like magic.,The thing is, we'd gonto this magic store in New York City,called Lou Tannen's Magic.,It was this great magic store.,It was a crappynlittle building in Midtown,,but you'd be in the elevator,nthe elevator would open --,there'd be this little, small magic store.,You'd be in the magic store.nAnd it was a magical place.,So I got all these magic tricks.nHere. I'll show you.,This is the kind of thing.nSo it would be like, you know.,Which is good, but now I can't move.,Now, I have to donthe rest of the thing like this.,I'm like, "Oh, wow.nLook at my computer over there!" 
 (Laughter) 
 So one of the thingsnthat I bought at the magic store was this:,Tannen's Mystery Magic Box.,The premise behind the MysterynMagic Box was the following:,15 dollars buys youn50 dollars worth of magic.,Which is a savings. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, I bought this decades agonand I'm not kidding.,If you look at this,nyou'll see it's never been opened.,But I've had this forever.,Now, I was looking at this,,it was in my office,nas it always is, on the shelf,,and I was thinking,nwhy have I not opened this?,And why have I kept it?,Because I'm not a pack rat.,I don't keep everything,,but for some reasonnI haven't opened this box.,And I felt like there wasna key to this, somehow,,in talking about something at TEDnthat I haven't discussed before,,and bored people elsewhere.,So I thought, maybenthere's something with this.,And there was this giant question mark.,I love the design,nfor what it's worth, of this thing.,And I started thinking,nwhy haven't I opened it? 
 And I realized that I haven't opened it,because it representsnsomething important -- to me.,It represents my grandfather.,Am I allowed to cry at TED?,Because -- no, I'm not going to cry. 
 (Laughter) 
 But -- 
 (Laughter) 
 The thing is that it representsninfinite possibility.,It represents hope.nIt represents potential.,And what I love about this box,,and what I realize I sort of donin whatever it is that I do,,is I find myselfndrawn to infinite possibility,,that sense of potential.,And I realize that mysterynis the catalyst for imagination.,Now, it's not the mostnground-breaking idea,,but when I started to thinknthat maybe there are times,when mystery is more importantnthan knowledge.,I started getting interested in this. 
 And so I started thinking about "Lost"nand the stuff that we do,,and I realized, oh my God, mystery boxesnare everywhere in what I do!,In the creation of "Lost,"nDamon Lindelof and I,,who created the show with me,,we were basically taskednwith creating this series,that we had very little time to do.,We had 11 and a half weeks,to write it, cast it, crew it, shoot it,ncut it, post it, turn in a two-hour pilot.,So it was not a lot of time.,And that sense of possibility --nwhat could this thing be?,There was no time to develop it.,I'm sure you're all familiar with people,who tell you what you can't donand what you should change.,There was no time for that,nwhich is kind of amazing.,And so we did this show,,and for those of younwho haven't seen it, or don't know it,,I can show you onenlittle clip from the pilot,,just to show you some stuff that we did. 
 (Engine roaring) 
 (Video) Claire: Help! 
 Please help me!,Help me! Please, help me! 
 Jack: Get him out of here!nGet him away from the engine!,Get him out of here! 
 (Engine roaring) 
 C: Help me, please!nI'm having contractions! 
 J: How many months pregnant are you? 
 C: I'm only eight months. 
 J: And how far apart are they coming? 
 C: I don't know. I think it just happened. 
 Man: Hey! Hey! Hey, get away from -- 
 JJ Abrams: 10 years ago,nif we wanted to do that,,we'd have to kill a stuntman. 
 (Laughter) 
 It would be harder.,Take two would be a bitch. 
 (Laughter) 
 So the amazing thing was,nwe were able to do this thing.,And part of that wasnthe amazing availability of technology,,knowing we could do anything.,I mean, we could never have done that.,We might have been able to write it;,we wouldn't have been ablento depict it like we did.,So part of the amazing thing for menis in the creative process,,technology is mind-blowinglyninspiring to me.,I realize that that blank pagenis a magic box, you know?,It needs to be fillednwith something fantastic. 
 I used to have the "Ordinary People"nscript that I'd flip through.,The romance was amazing to me;nit would inspire me.,I wanted to try and fill pages,with the same kind of spiritnand thought and emotion,that that script did.,So, you know, I love Apple computers.,I'm obsessed.,So the Apple computer --nthe PowerBook -- this computer,,it challenges me.,It basically says, what are youngoing to write worthy of me?,I feel this -- I'm compelled. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I often am like,nyou know, dude, today I'm out.,I got nothing. You know? So there's that. 
 In terms of the content of it,,you look at stories, you think,nwhat are stories but mystery boxes?,There's a fundamental question --nin TV, the first act is called the teaser.,It's literally the teaser.nIt's the big question.,So you're drawn into it.nThen there's another question.,And it goes on. Look at "Star Wars.",The droids meet the mysterious woman.,Who's that? We don't know. Mystery box!nThen you meet Luke Skywalker.,He gets the droid,nyou see the holographic image.,You learn it's a message.nShe wants to find Obi Wan Kenobi.,He's her only hope.nBut who's Obi Wan Kenobi?,Mystery box! So then he meets Ben Kenobi.,Ben Kenobi is Obi Wan Kenobi.nHoly shit! So it keeps us -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Have you guys not seen that? 
 (Laughter) 
 It's huge! Anyway --,So there's this thing with mystery boxesnthat I started feeling compelled.,Then there's the thing of mysterynin terms of imagination --,the withholding of information.,You know, doing that intentionallynis much more engaging.,Whether it's like the shark in "Jaws" --,if Spielberg's mechanical shark,nBruce, had worked,,it would not be remotely as scary;nyou would have seen it too much.,In "Alien", they nevernreally showed the alien: terrifying!,Even in a movie likena romantic comedy, "The Graduate,",they're having that date,nand they're in the car,,and it's loud, and so they put the top up.,You don't hear anything they're saying!,You can't hear a word!nBut it's the most romantic date ever.,And you love it because you don't hear it. 
 So to me, there's that.nAnd then, finally, there's this idea --,stretching the paradigm a little bit --,but the idea of the mystery box.,Meaning, what you think you're getting,nthen what you're really getting.,And it's true in so manynmovies and stories.,Look at "E.T.," for example --,"E.T." is this unbelievablenmovie about what?,It's about an aliennwho meets a kid, right?,Well, it's not. "E.T." is about divorce.,"E.T." is about a heartbroken,ndivorce-crippled family,,and ultimately,nthis kid who can't find his way.,"Die Hard," right? Crazy, great, fun,naction-adventure movie in a building.,It's about a guynwho's on the verge of divorce.,He's showing up to L.A.,ntail between his legs.,There are great scenes --,maybe not the most amazingndramatic scenes in the history of time,,but pretty great scenes.,There's a half an hournof investment in character,before you get to the stuffnthat you're expecting. 
 When you look at a movie like "Jaws,",the scene that you expect --nwe have the screen?,These are the kind of scenes,that you remember and expect from "Jaws.",And she's being eaten;,there's a shark. 
 (Woman screaming) 
 The thing about "Jaws" is,nit's really about a guy,who is sort of dealing with his placenin the world -- with his masculinity,,with his family, how he's going to,nyou know, make it work in this new town.,This is one of my favorite scenes ever,,and this is a scenenthat you wouldn't necessarily think of,when you think of "Jaws."nBut it's an amazing scene. 
 (Video) Father: C'mere.,Give us a kiss. 
 Son: Why? 
 Father: 'Cause I need it. 
 JJA: Come on. "Why? 'Cause I need it"?,Best scene ever, right? 
 (Laughter) 
 Come on! So you think of "Jaws" --,so that's the kind of stuff that,,like, you know --nthe investment of character,,which is the stuff that reallynis inside the box, you know?,It's why when people do sequels,nor rip off movies, you know, of a genre,,they're ripping off the wrong thing.,You're not supposednto rip off the shark or the monster.,You know, if you rip something off --nrip off the character.,Rip off the stuff that matters.,I mean, look inside yourselfnand figure out what is inside you.,Because ultimately,nthe mystery box is all of us. 
 So there's that. Then the distribution.,What's a bigger mystery boxnthan a movie theater? You know?,You go to the theater,nyou're just so excited to see anything.,The moment the lights go downnis often the best part.,And you're full of that amazing --nthat feeling of excited anticipation.,And often, the movie's therenand it's going,,and then something happensnand you go, "Oh --", and then, "Mmm ...",When it's a great movie,nyou're along for the ride,because you're willingnto give yourself to it. 
 So to me, whether it's a TV,nan iPod, computer, cell phone --,It's funny, I'm an --nas I said, Apple fanatic --,and one day, about a year or so ago,,I was signing on online in the morningnto watch Steve Jobs' keynote,,because I always do.,And he came on,nhe was presenting the video iPod,,and what was onnthe enormous iPod behind him?,"Lost"! I had no idea!,And I realized, holy shit,nit'd come full circle.,The inspiration I get from the technology,is now using the stuff that I donto sell technology. It's nuts! 
 (Laughter) 
 I was going to show you a couplenof other things I'm going to skip.,I'll show you one other thingnthat has nothing to do with anything.,This is something online;nsix years ago, they did this.,This is an online thing done by guysnwho had some visual effects experience.,But the point was,nthat they were doing things,that were using these mystery boxesnthat they had -- everyone has now.,What I've realized is what my grandfatherndid for me when I was a kid,,everyone has access to now.,You don't need to have my grandfather,nthough you wish you had.,But I have to tell you --,this is a guy doing stuffnon a Quadra 950 computer --,the resolution's a little bit low --,using Infinity softwarenthey stopped making 15 years ago.,He's doing stuff that looks as amazing,as stuff I've seennreleased from Hollywood. 
 The most incrediblensort of mystery, I think,,is now the question of what comes next.,Because it is now democratized.,So now, the creation of media --nit's everywhere.,The stuff that I was luckynand begging for to get when I was a kid,is now ubiquitous.,And so, there's an amazing sensenof opportunity out there.,And when I think of the filmmakersnwho exist out there now,who would have been silenced, you know --,who have been silenced in the past --,it's a very exciting thing. 
 I used to say in classesnand lectures and stuff,,to someone who wants to write,n"Go! Write! Do your thing.",It's free, you don't need permission.,But now I can say, "Go make your movie!"nThere's nothing stopping you,from going out therenand getting the technology.,You can lease, rent,nbuy stuff off the shelf,that is either as good, or just as good,,as the stuff that's being usednby the, you know, "legit people.",No community is best servednwhen only the elite have control.,And I feel likenthis is an amazing opportunity,to see what else is out there. 
 When I did "Mission: Impossible III,"nwe had amazing visual effects.,ILM did the effects; it was incredible.,And sort of my dream to be involved.,And there are a couplenof sequences in the movie,,like these couple of momentsnI'll show you.,There's that. 
 (Video) Luther: Ethan, move! 
 (Explosion) 
 Obviously, I have an obsessionnwith big crazy explosions.,So my favorite visual effect in the movienis the one I'm about to show you.,It's a scene in whichnTom's character wakes up.,He's drowsy. He's crazy.,And the guy wakes up,nand he shoves this gun in his nose,and shoots this little capsuleninto his brain,that he's going to use laternto kill him, as bad guys do. 
 (Video) Brownway: Good morning. 
 JJA: OK, now.,When we shot that scene,,the actor who had the gun,nan English actor, Eddie Marsan --,sweetheart, great guy --,he kept taking the gunnand putting it into Tom's nose,,and it was hurting Tom's nose.,And I learned thisnvery early on in my career:,Don't hurt Tom's nose. 
 (Laughter) 
 There are three thingsnyou don't want to do.,Number two is: Don't hurt Tom's nose.,So Eddie has this gun --nand he's this sweet English guy.,He's like, "Sorry,nI don't want to hurt you.",I'm like, "We have tonmake this look good.",And I realized that we had to do somethingnbecause it wasn't working.,And I thought backnto what I would have done,using the Super 8 cameranthat my grandfather got me,sitting in that room,,and I realized that handndidn't have to be Eddie Marsan's.,It could be Tom's.,And Tom would knownjust how hard to push the gun.,He wouldn't hurt himself. 
 So we took his hand and we painted itnto look a little bit more like Eddie's.,We put it in Eddie's sleeve,,and so the hand that you see --,that's not Eddie's hand, that's Tom's.nSo Tom is playing two roles. 
 (Laughter) 
 And he didn't ask for any more money.,So here, here. Watch it again.,There he is. He's waking up.,He's drowsy, been through a lot. 
 (Video) Brownway: Good morning. 
 JJA: Tom's hand. Tom's hand. Tom's hand.,Anyway.,So ... 
 (Applause) 
 Thanks. 
 (Applause) 
 So you don't need the greatest technologynto do things that can work in movies.,And the mystery box,nin honor of my grandfather, stays closed. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I hope you'll understand my English.,In the mornings it is terrible, and the afternoon is worst.,(Laughter),During many years, I made some speeches starting with this,saying: "City is not a problem, it's a solution.",And more and more, I'm convinced that,it's not only a solution for a country,,but it's a solution for the problem of climate change. 
 But we have a very pessimistic approach about the cities.,I'm working in cities for almost 40 years,,and where every mayor is trying to tell me his city is so big,,or the other mayors say, "We don't have financial resources,",I would like to say,from the experience I had: every city in the world,can be improved in less than three years.,There's no matter of scale. It's not a question of scale,,it's not a question of financial resources.,Every problem in a city has to have its own equation of co-responsibility,and also a design. 
 So to start, I want to introduce some characters,from a book I made for teenagers.,The best example of quality of life is the turtle,because the turtle is an example of living and working together.,And when you realize that the casque of the turtle,looks like an urban tessitura,,and can we imagine, if we cut the casque of the turtle, how sad she's going to be?,And that's what we're doing in our cities:,living here, working here, having leisure here.,And most of the people are leaving the city,and living outside of the city. 
 So, the other character is Otto, the automobile.,He is invited for a party -- he never wants to leave.,The chairs are on the tables and still drinking,,and he drinks a lot. (Laughter),And he coughs a lot. Very egotistical:,he carries only one or two people,and he asks always for more infrastructure.,Freeways.,He's a very demanding person.,And on the other hand, Accordion, the friendly bus,,he carries 300 people --,275 in Sweden; 300 Brazilians. (Laughter) 
 Speaking about the design: every city has its own design.,Curitiba, my city: three million in the metropolitan area,,1,800,000 people in the city itself.,Curitiba, Rio: it's like two birds kissing themselves.,Oaxaca, San Francisco -- it's very easy:,Market Street, Van Ness and the waterfront.,And every city has its own design.,But to make it happen, sometimes you have to propose a scenario,and to propose a design --,an idea that everyone, or the large majority,,will help you to make it happen.,And that's the structure of the city of Curitiba. 
 And it's an example of living and working together.,And this is where we have more density;,it's where we have more public transport.,So, this system started in '74. We started with 25,000 passengers a day,,now it's 2,200,000 passengers a day.,And it took 25 years until another city ...,which is Bogota, and they did a very good job.,And now there's 83 cities all over the world that they,are doing what they call the BRT of Curitiba.,And one thing: it's important not for only your own city;,every city, besides its normal problems,,they have a very important role,in being with the whole humanity.,That means mostly two main issues --,mobility and sustainability -- are becoming very important for the cities. 
 And this is an articulated bus, double-articulated.,And we are very close to my house.,You can come when you are in Curitiba and have a coffee there.,And that's the evolution of the system.,What in the design that made the difference,is the boarding tubes:,the boarding tube gives to the bus the same performance as a subway.,That's why, I'm trying to say,,it's like metro-nizing the bus.,This is the design of the bus,,and you can pay before entering the bus you're boarding.,And for handicapped, they can use this as a normal system. 
 What I'm trying to say is,the major contribution on carbon emissions are from the cars --,more than 50 percent -- so when we depend only on cars, it's ...,-- that's why when we're talking about sustainability,,it's not enough, green buildings.,It's not enough, a new materials.,It's not enough, new sources of energy.,It's the concept of the city, the design of the city,,that's also important, too. And also, how to teach the children.,I'll speak on this later on. 
 Our idea of mobility is trying,to make the connections between all the systems.,We started in '83, proposing for the city of Rio,how to connect the subway with the bus.,The subway was against, of course.,And 23 years after, they called us to develop -- we're developing this idea.,And you can understand how different it's going to be,,the image of Rio with the system --,one-minute frequency.,And it's not Shanghai,,it's not being colored during the day, only at night,it will look this way. 
 And before you say it's a Norman Foster design,,we designed this in '83.,And this is the model,,how it's going to work. So, it's the same system;,the vehicle is different. And that's the model.,What I'm trying to say is, I'm not trying,to prove which system of transport is better.,I'm trying to say we have to combine,all the systems, and with one condition:,never -- if you have a subway, if you have surface systems,,if you have any kind of system --,never compete in the same space. 
 And coming back to the car, I always used to say,that the car is like your mother-in-law:,you have to have good relationship with her,,but she cannot command your life.,So, when the only woman in your life is your mother-in-law,,you have a problem. (Laughter),So, all the ideas about how to transform through design --,old quarries and open universities and botanic garden --,all of it's related to how we teach the children.,And the children, we teach during six months how to separate their garbage.,And after, the children teach their parents.,And now we have 70 percent --,since 20 years, it's the highest rate of separation of garbage in the world.,Seven zero.,(Applause),So teach the children. 
 I would like to say, if we want to have a sustainable world,we have to work with everything what's said,,but don't forget the cities and the children.,I'm working in a museum and also a multi-use city,,because you cannot have empty places during 18 hours a day.,You should have always,a structure of living and working together.,Try to understand the sectors in the city,that could play different roles during the 24 hours. 
 Another issue is, a city's like our family portrait.,We don't rip our family portrait,,even if we don't like the nose of our uncle,,because this portrait is you.,And these are the references that we have in any city.,This is the main pedestrian mall;,we did it in 72 hours. Yes, you have to be fast.,And these are the references from our ethnic contribution.,This is the Italian portal,,the Ukrainian park, the Polish park, the Japanese square, the German park.,All of a sudden, the Soviet Union, they split.,And since we have people from,Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, [unclear],,we have to stop the program.,(Laughter) 
 Don't forget: creativity starts when you cut a zero from your budget.,If you cut two zeros, it's much better.,And this is the Wire Opera theater. We did it in two months.,Parks -- old quarries that they were transformed into parks.,Quarries once made the nature, and,sometimes we took this and we transformed.,And every part can be transformed;,every frog can be transformed in a prince. 
 So, in a city, you have to work fast.,Planning takes time. And I'm proposing urban acupuncture.,That means me, with some focal ideas to help the normal process of planning.,And this is an acupuncture note --,or I.M. Pei's. Some small ones,can make the city better.,The smallest park in New York, the most beautiful:,32 meters. 
 So, I want just to end saying,that you can always propose new materials -- new sustainable materials --,but keep in mind that we have to work fast,to the end, because we don't have the whole time to plan.,And I think creativity, innovation is starting.,And we cannot have all the answers.,So when you start --,and we cannot be so prepotent on having all the answers --,it's important starting and having the contribution from people,,and they could teach you,if you're not in the right track. 
 At the end, I would like if you can help me to sing the sustainable song.,OK?,Please, allow me just two minutes.,You're going to make the music and the rhythm.

 Thank you.,(Applause)I’m working a lot with motion and animation,,and also I'm an old DJ and a musician.,So, music videos are something that I always found interesting,,but they always seem to be so reactive.,So I was thinking, can you remove us as creators,and try to make the music be the voice,and have the animation following it?,So with two designers, Tolga and Christina, at my office, we took a track --,many of you probably know it. It’s about 25 years old,,and it's David Byrne and Brian Eno --,and we did this little animation.,And I think that it's maybe interesting, also,,that it deals with two problematic issues,,which are rising waters and religion. 
 Song: Before God destroyed the people on the Earth,,he warned Noah to build an Ark.,And after Noah built his Ark,,I believe he told Noah to warn the people,that they must change all their wicked ways,before he come upon them and destroy them.,And when Noah had done built his Ark,,I understand that somebody began to rend a song.,And the song began to move on I understand like this.,And when Noah had done built his Ark ...,Move on ... In fact ... Concern ...,So they get tired, has come dark and rain; they get weary and tired.,And then he went and knocked an old lady house.,And old lady ran to the door and say, "Who is it?",Jack say, "Me, Mama-san, could we spend the night here?,Because we’re far from home, we’re very tired.",And the old lady said, "Oh yes, come on in.",It was come dark and rain, will make you weary and tired. 
 (Applause)I live and work from Tokyo, Japan.,And I specialize in human behavioral research,,and applying what we learn to think about the future in different ways,,and to design for that future.,And you know, to be honest, I've been doing this for seven years,,and I haven't got a clue what the future is going to be like.,But I've got a pretty good idea,how people will behave when they get there. 
 This is my office. It's out there.,It's not in the lab,,and it's increasingly in places like India, China, Brazil, Africa.,We live on a planet -- 6.3 billion people.,About three billion people, by the end of this year,,will have cellular connectivity.,And it'll take about another two years to connect the next billion after that.,And I mention this because,,if we want to design for that future,,we need to figure out what those people are about.,And that's, kind of, where I see what my job is,and what our team's job is. 
 Our research often starts with a very simple question.,So I'll give you an example. What do you carry?,If you think of everything in your life that you own,,when you walk out that door,,what do you consider to take with you?,When you're looking around, what do you consider?,Of that stuff, what do you carry?,And of that stuff, what do you actually use? 
 So this is interesting to us,,because the conscious and subconscious decision process,implies that the stuff that you do take with you and end up using,has some kind of spiritual, emotional or functional value.,And to put it really bluntly, you know,,people are willing to pay for stuff that has value, right?,So I've probably done about five years' research,looking at what people carry.,I go in people's bags. I look in people's pockets, purses.,I go in their homes. And we do this worldwide,,and we follow them around town with video cameras.,It's kind of like stalking with permission.,And we do all this -- and to go back to the original question,,what do people carry? 
 And it turns out that people carry a lot of stuff.,OK, that's fair enough.,But if you ask people what the three most important things that they carry are --,across cultures and across gender and across contexts --,most people will say keys, money,and, if they own one, a mobile phone.,And I'm not saying this is a good thing, but this is a thing, right?,I mean, I couldn't take your phones off you if I wanted to.,You'd probably kick me out, or something.,OK, it might seem like an obvious thing,for someone who works for a mobile phone company to ask.,But really, the question is, why? Right?,So why are these things so important in our lives?,And it turns out, from our research, that it boils down to survival --,survival for us and survival for our loved ones. 
 So, keys provide an access to shelter and warmth --,transport as well, in the U.S. increasingly.,Money is useful for buying food, sustenance,,among all its other uses.,And a mobile phone, it turns out, is a great recovery tool.,If you prefer this kind of Maslow's hierarchy of needs,,those three objects are very good at supporting,the lowest rungs in Maslow's hierarchy of needs.,Yes, they do a whole bunch of other stuff,,but they're very good at this.,And in particular, it's the mobile phone's ability,to allow people to transcend space and time.,And what I mean by that is, you know,,you can transcend space by simply making a voice call, right?,And you can transcend time by sending a message at your convenience,,and someone else can pick it up at their convenience.,And this is fairly universally appreciated, it turns out,,which is why we have three billion plus people who have been connected.,And they value that connectivity. 
 But actually, you can do this kind of stuff with PCs.,And you can do them with phone kiosks.,And the mobile phone, in addition, is both personal --,and so it also gives you a degree of privacy -- and it's convenient.,You don't need to ask permission from anyone,,you can just go ahead and do it, right?,However, for these things to help us survive,,it depends on them being carried.,But -- and it's a pretty big but -- we forget.,We're human, that's what we do. It's one of our features.,I think, quite a nice feature.,So we forget, but we're also adaptable,,and we adapt to situations around us pretty well.,And so we have these strategies to remember,,and one of them was mentioned yesterday.,And it's, quite simply, the point of reflection.,And that's that moment when you're walking out of a space,,and you turn around, and quite often you tap your pockets.,Even women who keep stuff in their bags tap their pockets.,And you turn around, and you look back into the space,,and some people talk aloud.,And pretty much everyone does it at some point. 
 OK, the next thing is -- most of you, if you have a stable home life,,and what I mean is that you don't travel all the time, and always in hotels,,but most people have what we call a center of gravity.,And a center of gravity is where you keep these objects.,And these things don't stay in the center of gravity,,but over time, they gravitate there.,It's where you expect to find stuff.,And in fact, when you're turning around,,and you're looking inside the house,,and you're looking for this stuff,,this is where you look first, right?,OK, so when we did this research,,we found the absolutely, 100 percent, guaranteed way,to never forget anything ever, ever again.,And that is, quite simply, to have nothing to remember.,(Laughter) 
 OK, now, that sounds like something you get on a Chinese fortune cookie, right?,But is, in fact, about the art of delegation.,And from a design perspective,,it's about understanding what you can delegate to technology,and what you can delegate to other people.,And it turns out, delegation -- if you want it to be --,can be the solution for pretty much everything,,apart from things like bodily functions, going to the toilet.,You can't ask someone to do that on your behalf.,And apart from things like entertainment,,you wouldn't pay for someone to go to the cinema for you and have fun on your behalf,,or, at least, not yet.,Maybe sometime in the future, we will. 
 So, let me give you an example of delegation in practice, right.,So this is -- probably the thing I'm most passionate about,is the research that we've been doing on illiteracy,and how people who are illiterate communicate.,So, the U.N. estimated -- this is 2004 figures --,that there are almost 800 million people who can't read and write, worldwide.,So, we've been conducting a lot of research.,And one of the things we were looking at is --,if you can't read and write,,if you want to communicate over distances,,you need to be able to identify the person,that you want to communicate with.,It could be a phone number, it could be an e-mail address,,it could be a postal address.,Simple question: if you can't read and write,,how do you manage your contact information? 
 And the fact is that millions of people do it.,Just from a design perspective, we didn't really understand how they did it,,and so that's just one small example,of the kind of research that we were doing.,And it turns out that illiterate people are masters of delegation.,So they delegate that part of the task process to other people,,the stuff that they can't do themselves.,Let me give you another example of delegation.,This one's a little bit more sophisticated,,and this is from a study that we did in Uganda,about how people who are sharing devices, use those devices.,Sente is a word in Uganda that means money.,It has a second meaning, which is to send money as airtime. OK? 
 And it works like this.,So let's say, June, you're in a village, rural village.,I'm in Kampala and I'm the wage earner.,I'm sending money back, and it works like this.,So, in your village, there's one person in the village with a phone,,and that's the phone kiosk operator.,And it's quite likely that they'd have a quite simple mobile phone as a phone kiosk.,So what I do is, I buy a prepaid card like this.,And instead of using that money to top up my own phone,,I call up the local village operator.,And I read out that number to them, and they use it to top up their phone.,So, they're topping up the value from Kampala,,and it's now being topped up in the village.,You take a 10 or 20 percent commission, and then you --,the kiosk operator takes 10 or 20 percent commission,,and passes the rest over to you in cash. 
 OK, there's two things I like about this.,So the first is, it turns anyone who has access to a mobile phone --,anyone who has a mobile phone --,essentially into an ATM machine.,It brings rudimentary banking services to places,where there's no banking infrastructure.,And even if they could have access to the banking infrastructure,,they wouldn't necessarily be considered viable customers,,because they're not wealthy enough to have bank accounts.,There's a second thing I like about this.,And that is that despite all the resources at my disposal,,and despite all our kind of apparent sophistication,,I know I could never have designed something as elegant,and as totally in tune with the local conditions as this. OK? 
 And, yes, there are things like Grameen Bank and micro-lending.,But the difference between this and that,is, there's no central authority trying to control this.,This is just street-up innovation.,So, it turns out the street is a never-ending source of,inspiration for us.,And OK, if you break one of these things here, you return it to the carrier.,They'll give you a new one.,They'll probably give you three new ones, right?,I mean, that's buy three, get one free. That kind of thing.,If you go on the streets of India and China, you see this kind of stuff.,And this is where they take the stuff that breaks,,and they fix it, and they put it back into circulation. 
 This is from a workbench in Jilin City, in China,,and you can see people taking down a phone,and putting it back together.,They reverse-engineer manuals.,This is a kind of hacker's manual,,and it's written in Chinese and English.,They also write them in Hindi.,You can subscribe to these.,There are training institutes where they're churning out people,for fixing these things as well.,But what I like about this is,,it boils down to someone on the street with a small, flat surface,,a screwdriver, a toothbrush for cleaning the contact heads --,because they often get dust on the contact heads -- and knowledge.,And it's all about the social network of the knowledge, floating around.,And I like this because it challenges the way that we design stuff,,and build stuff, and potentially distribute stuff.,It challenges the norms. 
 OK, for me the street just raises so many different questions.,Like, this is Viagra that I bought from a backstreet sex shop in China.,And China is a country where you get a lot of fakes.,And I know what you're asking -- did I test it?,I'm not going to answer that, OK.,But I look at something like this, and I consider the implications,of trust and confidence in the purchase process.,And we look at this and we think, well, how does that apply,,for example, for the design of -- the lessons from this --,apply to the design of online services, future services in these markets? 
 This is a pair of underpants from --,(Laughter) --,from Tibet.,And I look at something like this, and honestly, you know,,why would someone design underpants with a pocket, right?,And I look at something like this and it makes me question,,if we were to take all the functionality in things like this,,and redistribute them around the body,in some kind of personal area network,,how would we prioritize where to put stuff?,And yes, this is quite trivial, but actually the lessons from this can apply to that,kind of personal area networks.,And what you see here is a couple of phone numbers,written above the shack in rural Uganda.,This doesn't have house numbers. This has phone numbers.,So what does it mean when people's identity is mobile?,When those extra three billion people's identity is mobile, it isn't fixed?,Your notion of identity is out-of-date already, OK,,for those extra three billion people.,This is how it's shifting. 
 And then I go to this picture here, which is the one that I started with.,And this is from Delhi.,It's from a study we did into illiteracy,,and it's a guy in a teashop.,You can see the chai being poured in the background.,And he's a, you know, incredibly poor teashop worker,,on the lowest rungs in the society.,And he, somehow, has the appreciation,of the values of Livestrong.,And it's not necessarily the same values,,but some kind of values of Livestrong,,to actually go out and purchase them,,and actually display them. 
 For me, this kind of personifies this connected world,,where everything is intertwined, and the dots are --,it's all about the dots joining together.,OK, the title of this presentation is "Connections and Consequences,",and it's really a kind of summary of five years of trying to figure out,what it's going to be like when everyone on the planet,has the ability to transcend space and time,in a personal and convenient manner, right?,When everyone's connected. 
 And there are four things.,So, the first thing is the immediacy of ideas,,the speed at which ideas go around.,And I know TED is about big ideas,,but actually, the benchmark for a big idea is changing.,If you want a big idea, you need to embrace everyone on the planet,,that's the first thing. 
 The second thing is the immediacy of objects.,And what I mean by that is, as these become smaller,,as the functionality that you can access through this becomes greater --,things like banking, identity --,these things quite simply move very quickly around the world.,And so the speed of the adoption of things,is just going to become that much more rapid,,in a way that we just totally cannot conceive,,when you get it to 6.3 billion,and the growth in the world's population. 
 The next thing is that, however we design this stuff --,carefully design this stuff --,the street will take it, and will figure out ways to innovate,,as long as it meets base needs --,the ability to transcend space and time, for example.,And it will innovate in ways that we cannot anticipate.,In ways that, despite our resources, they can do it better than us.,That's my feeling.,And if we're smart, we'll look at this stuff that's going on,,and we'll figure out a way to enable it to inform and infuse,both what we design and how we design. 
 And the last thing is that -- actually, the direction of the conversation.,With another three billion people connected,,they want to be part of the conversation.,And I think our relevance and TED's relevance,is really about embracing that and learning how to listen, essentially.,And we need to learn how to listen.,So thank you very, very much.,(Applause)I've actually been waiting by the phone,for a call from TED for years.,And in fact, in 2000, I was ready to talk about eBay, but no call.,In 2003, I was ready to do a talk,about the Skoll Foundation and social entrepreneurship. No call.,In 2004, I started Participant Productions,and we had a really good first year, and no call.,And finally, I get a call last year,,and then I have to go up after J.J. Abrams.,(Laughter),You've got a cruel sense of humor, TED.,(Laughter) 
 When I first moved to Hollywood from Silicon Valley,,I had some misgivings.,But I found that there were some advantages to being in Hollywood.,(Laughter),And, in fact, some advantages to owning your own media company.,And I also found that Hollywood and Silicon Valley,have a lot more in common than I would have dreamed.,Hollywood has its sex symbols, and the Valley has its sex symbols.,(Laughter),Hollywood has its rivalries, and the Valley has its rivalries.,Hollywood gathers around power tables,,and the Valley gathers around power tables.,So it turned out there was a lot more in common,than I would have dreamed. 
 But I'm actually here today to tell a story.,And part of it is a personal story. When Chris invited me to speak,,he said, people think of you as a bit of an enigma,,and they want to know what drives you a bit.,And what really drives me is a vision of the future,that I think we all share.,It's a world of peace and prosperity and sustainability.,And when we heard a lot of the presentations,over the last couple of days,,Ed Wilson and the pictures of James Nachtwey,,I think we all realized how far we have to go,to get to this new version of humanity,that I like to call "Humanity 2.0.",And it's also something that resides in each of us,,to close what I think,are the two big calamities in the world today. 
 One is the gap in opportunity --,this gap that President Clinton last night,called uneven, unfair and unsustainable --,and, out of that, comes poverty and illiteracy and disease,and all these evils that we see around us.,But perhaps the other, bigger gap is what we call the hope gap.,And someone, at some point, came up with this very bad idea,that an ordinary individual couldn't make a difference in the world.,And I think that's just a horrible thing.,And so chapter one really begins today, with all of us,,because within each of us is the power to,equal those opportunity gaps and to close the hope gaps.,And if the men and women of TED,can't make a difference in the world, I don't know who can. 
 And for me, a lot of this started when I was younger,and my family used to go camping in upstate New York.,And there really wasn't much to do there for the summer,,except get beaten up by my sister or read books.,And so I used to read authors like James Michener,and James Clavell and Ayn Rand.,And their stories made the world seem a very small,and interconnected place.,And it struck me that if I could write stories,that were about this world as being small and interconnected,,that maybe I could get people interested in the issues,that affected us all, and maybe engage them to make a difference. 
 I didn't think that was necessarily the best way to make a living,,so I decided to go on a path to become financially independent,,so I could write these stories as quickly as I could.,I then had a bit of a wake-up call when I was 14.,And my dad came home one day,and announced that he had cancer, and it looked pretty bad.,And what he said was, he wasn't so much afraid that he might die,,but that he hadn't done the things that he wanted to with his life.,And knock on wood, he's still alive today, many years later.,But for a young man that made a real impression on me,,that one never knows how much time one really has.,So I set out in a hurry. I studied engineering.,I started a couple of businesses,that I thought would be the ticket to financial freedom. 
 One of those businesses was a computer rental business,called Micros on the Move,,which is very well named,,because people kept stealing the computers.,(Laughter),So I figured I needed to learn a little bit more about business,,so I went to Stanford Business School and studied there.,And while I was there, I made friends with a fellow,named Pierre Omidyar, who is here today. And Pierre, I apologize,for this. This is a photo from the old days.,And just after I'd graduated, Pierre came to me,with this idea to help people,buy and sell things online with each other.,And with the wisdom of my Stanford degree,,I said, "Pierre, what a stupid idea.",(Laughter),And needless to say, I was right.,(Laughter) 
 But right after that, Pierre -- in '96, Pierre and I left our full-time jobs,to build eBay as a company. And the rest of that story, you know.,The company went public two years later,and is today one of the best known companies in the world.,Hundreds of millions of people use it in hundreds of countries, and so on.,But for me, personally, it was a real change.,I went from living in a house with five guys in Palo Alto,and living off their leftovers,,to all of a sudden having all kinds of resources.,And I wanted to figure out how I could,take the blessing of these resources and share it with the world. 
 And around that time, I met John Gardner,,who is a remarkable man.,He was the architect of the Great Society programs,under Lyndon Johnson in the 1960s.,And I asked him what he felt was the best thing I could do,,or anyone could do, to make a difference,in the long-term issues facing humanity.,And John said, "Bet on good people doing good things.,Bet on good people doing good things.",And that really resonated with me. 
 I started a foundation,to bet on these good people doing good things.,These leading, innovative, nonprofit folks,,who are using business skills in a very leveraged way,to solve social problems.,People today we call social entrepreneurs.,And to put a face on it, people like Muhammad Yunus,,who started the Grameen Bank,,has lifted 100 million people plus out of poverty around the world,,won the Nobel Peace Prize.,But there's also a lot of people that you don't know.,Folks like Ann Cotton, who started a group called CAMFED in Africa,,because she felt girls' education was lagging.,And she started it about 10 years ago,,and today, she educates over a quarter million African girls.,And somebody like Dr. Victoria Hale,,who started the world's first nonprofit pharmaceutical company,,and whose first drug will be fighting visceral leishmaniasis,,also known as black fever.,And by 2010, she hopes to eliminate this disease,,which is really a scourge in the developing world.,And so this is one way to bet,on good people doing good things. 
 And a lot of this comes together in a philosophy of change,that I find really is powerful.,It's what we call, "Invest, connect and celebrate.",And invest: if you see good people doing good things,,invest in them. Invest in their organizations,,or in business. Invest in these folks.,Connecting them together through conferences --,like a TED -- brings so many powerful connections,,or through the World Forum on Social Entrepreneurship,that my foundation does at Oxford every year.,And celebrate them: tell their stories,,because not only are there good people doing good work,,but their stories can help close these gaps of hope. 
 And it was this last part of the mission, the celebrate part,,that really got me back to thinking when I was a kid,and wanted to tell stories to get people involved,in the issues that affect us all.,And a light bulb went off,,which was, first, that I didn't actually have to do the writing myself, I could find writers.,And then the next light bulb was, better than just writing,,what about film and TV, to get out to people in a big way?,And I thought about the films that inspired me,,films like "Gandhi" and "Schindler's List.",And I wondered who was doing these kinds of films today.,And there really wasn't a specific company,that was focused on the public interest. 
 So, in 2003, I started to make my way around Los Angeles,to talk about the idea of a pro-social media company,and I was met with a lot of encouragement.,One of the lines of encouragement,that I heard over and over was,,"The streets of Hollywood are littered with the carcasses of people like you,,who think you're going to come to this town and make movies.",And then of course, there was the other adage.,"The surest way to become a millionaire,is to start by being a billionaire and go into the movie business.",(Laughter) 
 Undeterred, in January of 2004, I started Participant Productions,with the vision to be a global media company,focused on the public interest.,And our mission is to produce entertainment,that creates and inspires social change.,And we don't just want people to see our movies,and say, that was fun, and forget about it.,We want them to actually get involved in the issues.,In 2005, we launched our first slate of films,,"Murder Ball," "North Country," "Syriana",and "Good Night and Good Luck.",And much to my surprise, they were noticed. 
 We ended up with 11 Oscar nominations for these films.,And it turned out to be a pretty good year for this guy.,Perhaps more importantly,,tens of thousands of people joined the advocacy programs,and the activism programs,that we created to go around the movies.,And we had an online component of that,,our community sect called Participate.net.,But with our social sector partners, like the ACLU and PBS and the,Sierra Club and the NRDC, once people saw the film,,there was actually something they could do to make a difference. 
 One of these films in particular, called "North Country," was actually,kind of a box office disaster.,But it was a film that starred Charlize Theron,and it was about women's rights, women's empowerment,,domestic violence and so on.,And we released the film at the same time that,the Congress was debating the renewal of the Violence Against Women Act.,And with screenings on the Hill, and discussions,,and with our social sector partners,,like the National Organization of Women,,the film was widely credited,with influencing the successful renewal of the act.,And that to me, spoke volumes, because it's --,the film started about a true-life story,about a woman who was harassed, sued her employer,,led to a landmark case that led to the Equal Opportunity Act,,and the Violence Against Women Act and others.,And then the movie about this person doing these things,,then led to this greater renewal.,And so again,,it goes back to betting on good people doing good things. 
 Speaking of which, our fellow TEDster, Al --,I first saw Al do his slide show presentation,on global warming in May of 2005.,At that point, I thought I knew something about global warming.,I thought it was a 30 to 50 year problem.,And after we saw his slide show,,it became clear that it was much more urgent.,And so right afterwards, I met backstage with Al, and,with Lawrence Bender, who was there, and Laurie David,,and Davis Guggenheim,,who was running documentaries for Participant at the time.,And with Al's blessing, we decided on the spot to turn it into a film,,because we felt that we could get the message out there,far more quickly than having Al go around the world,,speaking to audiences of 100 or 200 at a time. 
 And you know, there's another adage in Hollywood,,that nobody knows nothing about anything.,And I really thought this was going to be,a straight-to-PBS charitable initiative.,And so it was a great shock to all of us,when the film really captured the public interest,,and today is mandatory viewing in schools in England and Scotland,,and most of Scandinavia.,We've sent 50,000 DVDs to high school teachers in the U.S.,and it's really changed the debate on global warming.,It was also a pretty good year for this guy.,We now call Al the George Clooney of global warming.,(Laughter) 
 And for Participant, this is just the start.,Everything we do looks at the major issues in the world.,And we have 10 films in production right now,,and dozens others in development.,I'll quickly talk about a few coming up.,One is "Charlie Wilson's War," with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts.,And it's the true story of Congressman Charlie Wilson, and,how he funded the Taliban to fight the Russians in Afghanistan.,And we're also doing a movie called "The Kite Runner,",based on the book "The Kite Runner," also about Afghanistan.,And we think once people see these films,,they'll have a much better understanding of that part of the world,and the Middle East in general. 
 We premiered a film called "The Chicago 10" at Sundance this year.,It's based on the protesters at the Democratic Convention in 1968,,Abby Hoffman and crew,,and, again, a story about a small group of individuals,who did make change in the world.,And a documentary that we're doing on Jimmy Carter,and his Mid-East peace efforts over the years.,And in particular, we've been following him on his recent book tour,,which, as many of you know, has been very non-controversial --,(Laughter),-- which is really bad for getting people to come see a movie. 
 In closing, I'd like to say that everybody has the opportunity,to make change in their own way.,And all the people in this room,have done so through their business lives,,or their philanthropic work, or their other interests.,And one thing that I've learned,is that there's never one right way to make change.,One can do it as a tech person, or as a finance person,,or a nonprofit person, or as an entertainment person,,but every one of us is all of those things and more. 
 And I believe if we do these things,,we can close the opportunity gaps, we can close the hope gaps.,And I can imagine, if we do this,,the headlines in 10 years might read something like these:,"New AIDS Cases in Africa Fall to Zero,","U.S. Imports its Last Barrel of Oil" --,(Applause),-- "Israelis and Palestinians Celebrate,10 Years of Peaceful Coexistence.",(Applause),And I like this one, "Snow Has Returned to Kilimanjaro.",(Laughter),And finally, an eBay listing for one well-traveled slide show,,now obsolete, museum piece. Please contact Al Gore.,And I believe that, working together,,we can make all of these things happen.,And I want to thank you all for having me here today.,It's been a real honor. Thank you.,(Applause),Oh, thank you.I'm really scared. I don't think we're going to make it.,Probably by now most of you have seen Al Gore's amazing talk.,Shortly after I saw that, we had some friends over for dinner,with the family. The conversation turned to global warming,,and everybody agreed, there's a real problem.,We've got a climate crisis.,So, we went around the table to talk about what we should do.,The conversation came to my 15-year-old daughter, Mary.,She said, "I agree with everything that's been said.,I'm scared and I'm angry." And then she turned to me and said,,"Dad, your generation created this problem; you'd better fix it." Wow.,All the conversation stopped. All the eyes turned to me.,(Laughter),I didn't know what to say. Kleiner's second law is,,"There is a time when panic is the appropriate response.",(Laughter),And we've reached that time. We cannot afford to underestimate,this problem. If we face irreversible and catastrophic consequences,,we must act, and we must act decisively.,I've got to tell you, for me, everything changed that evening. 
 And so, my partners and I, we set off on this mission to learn more,,to try to do much more. So, we mobilized. We got on airplanes.,We went to Brazil. We went to China and to India,,to Bentonville, Arkansas, to Washington, D.C. and to Sacramento.,And so, what I'd like to do now is to tell you,about what we've learned in those journeys.,Because the more we learned, the more concerned we grew.,You know, my partners at Kleiner and I were compulsive networkers,,and so when we see a big problem or an opportunity,like avian flu or personalized medicine,,we just get together the smartest people we know.,For this climate crisis, we assembled a network, really,,of superstars, from policy activists to scientists and entrepreneurs,and business leaders. Fifty or so of them.,And so, I want to tell you about what we've learned in doing that,and four lessons I've learned in the last year. 
 The first lesson is that companies are really powerful,,and that matters a lot. This is a story about,how Wal-Mart went green, and what that means.,Two years ago, the CEO, Lee Scott, believed that green is,the next big thing, and so Wal-Mart made going green a top priority.,They committed that they're going to take their existing stores,and reduce their energy consumption by 20 percent,,and their new stores by 30 percent, and do all that in seven years.,The three biggest uses of energy in a store are heating,and air conditioning, then lighting, and then refrigeration.,So, look what they did.,They painted the roofs of all their stores white.,They put smart skylights through their stores,so they could harvest the daylight and reduce the lighting demands.,And, third, they put the refrigerated goods,behind closed doors with LED lighting.,I mean, why would you try to refrigerate a whole store?,These are really simple, smart solutions based on existing technology. 
 Why does Wal-Mart matter? Well, it's massive.,They're the largest private employer in America.,They're the largest private user of electricity.,They have the second-largest vehicle fleet on the road.,And they have one of the world's most amazing supply chains,,60,000 suppliers. If Wal-Mart were a country,,it would be the sixth-largest trading partner with China.,And maybe most important, they have a big effect on other companies. 
 When Wal-Mart declares it's going to go green and be profitable,,it has a powerful impact on other great institutions.,So, let me tell you this:,when Wal-Mart achieves 20 percent energy reductions,,that's going to be a very big deal. But I'm afraid it's not enough.,We need Wal-Mart and every other company to do the same. 
 The second thing that we learned is that individuals matter,,and they matter enormously.,I've got another Wal-Mart story for you, OK?,Wal-Mart has over 125 million U.S. customers.,That's a third of the U.S. population.,65 million compact fluorescent light bulbs were sold last year.,And Wal-Mart has committed they're going to sell,another 100 million light bulbs in the coming year. But it's not easy.,Consumers don't really like these light bulbs.,The light's kind of funny, they won't dim,,takes a while for them to start up.,But the pay-off is really enormous.,100 million compact fluorescent light bulbs means,that we'll save 600 million dollars in energy bills,,and 20 million tons of CO2 every year, year in and year out.,It does seem really hard to get consumers to do the right thing.,It is stupid that we use two tons of steel, glass and plastic,to haul our sorry selves to the shopping mall.,It's stupid that we put water in plastic bottles,in Fiji and ship it here.,(Laughter) 
 It's hard to change consumer behavior,because consumers don't know how much this stuff costs. Do you know?,Do you know how much CO2 you generated to drive here or fly here?,I don't know, and I should.,Those of us who care about all this would act better,if we knew what the real costs were.,But as long as we pretend that CO2 is free,,as long as these uses are nearly invisible, how can we expect change?,I'm really afraid, because I think the kinds of changes,we can reasonably expect from individuals,are going to be clearly not enough. 
 The third lesson we learned is that policy matters. It really matters.,In fact, policy is paramount.,I've got a behind-the-scenes story for you,about that green tech network I described.,At the end of our first meeting, we got together to talk about,what the action items would be, how we'd follow up.,And Bob Epstein raised a hand. He stood up.,You know, Bob's that Berkeley techie type who started Sybase.,Well, Bob said the most important thing we could do right now,is to make it clear in Sacramento, California,that we need a market-based system of mandates,that's going to cap and reduce greenhouse gases in California.,It's necessary and, just as important,,it's good for the California economy. 
 So, eight of us went to Sacramento in August and we met,with the seven undecided legislators and we lobbied for AB32.,You know what? Six of those seven voted yes in favor of the bill,,so it passed, and it passed by a vote of 47 to 32.,(Applause),Please. Thank you.,I think it's the most important legislation of 2006. Why?,Because California was the first state in this country,to mandate 25 percent reduction of greenhouse gases by 2020.,And the result of that is, we're going to generate 83,000 new jobs,,four billion dollars a year in annual income, and reduce the CO2 emissions,by 174 million tons a year.,California emits only seven percent of U.S. CO2 emissions.,It's only a percent and a half of the country's CO2 emissions. It's a great start,,but I've got to tell you -- where I started -- I'm really afraid.,In fact, I'm certain California's not enough. 
 Here's a story about national policy that we could all learn from.,You know Tom Friedman says, "If you don't go, you don't know"?,Well, we went to Brazil to meet Dr. Jose Goldemberg.,He's the father of the ethanol revolution.,He told us that Brazil's government mandated,that every gasoline station in the country would carry ethanol.,And they mandated that their new vehicles,would be flex-fuel compatible, right?,They'd run ethanol or ordinary gasoline.,And so, here's what's happened in Brazil.,They now have 29,000 ethanol pumps --,this versus 700 in the U.S., and a paltry two in California --,and in three years their new car fleet,has gone from four percent to 85 percent flex-fuel.,Compare that to the U.S.: five percent are flex-fuel.,And you know what? Most consumers who have them don't even know it.,So, what's happened in Brazil is, they've replaced,40 percent of the gasoline consumed by their automotive fleet with ethanol.,That's 59 billion dollars since 1975,that they didn't ship to the Middle East.,It's created a million jobs inside that country,,and it's saved 32 million tons of CO2. It's really substantial.,That's 10 percent of the CO2 emissions across their entire country.,But Brazil's only 1.3 percent of the world's CO2 emission.,So, Brazil's ethanol miracle, I'm really afraid, is not enough.,In fact, I'm afraid all of the best policies we have,are not going to be enough. 
 The fourth and final lesson we've learned,is about the potential of radical innovation.,So, I want to tell you about a tragic problem,and a breakthrough technology.,Every year a million and a half people die of,a completely preventable disease. That's malaria. 6,000 people a day.,All for want of two dollars' worth of medications,that we can buy at the corner drugstore.,Well, two dollars, two dollars is too much for Africa.,So, a team of Berkeley researchers with 15 million dollars,from the Gates Foundation is engineering, designing a radical new way,to make the key ingredient, called artemisinin,,and they're going to make that drug 10 times cheaper.,And in doing so, they'll save a million lives --,at least a million lives a year. A million lives.,Their breakthrough technology is synthetic biology.,This leverages millions of years of evolution,by redesigning bugs to make really useful products.,Now, what you do is, you get inside the microbe,,you change its metabolic pathways, and you end up with a living chemical factory. 
 Now, you may ask,,John, what has this got to go with green and with climate crisis?,Well, I'll tell you -- a lot.,We've now formed a company called Amyris, and this technology,that they're using can be used to make better biofuels.,Don't let me skip over that. Better biofuels are a really big deal.,That means we can precisely engineer the molecules in the fuel chain,and optimize them along the way.,So, if all goes well, they're going to have designer bugs in warm vats,that are eating and digesting sugars to excrete better biofuels.,I guess that's better living through bugs.,Alan Kay is famous for saying,the best way to predict the future is to invent it.,And, of course, at Kleiner we, kind of, apologize and say,the second best way is to finance it.,And that's why we're investing 200 million dollars,in a wide range of really disruptive new technologies,for innovation in green technologies.,And we're encouraging others to do it as well.,We're talking a lot about this. 
 In 2005, there were 600 million dollars invested in new technologies,of the sort you see here. It doubled in 2006 to 1.2 billion dollars.,But I'm really afraid we need much, much more.,For reference, fact one:,Exxon's revenues in 2005 were a billion dollars a day.,Do you know, they only invested 0.2 percent of revenues in R&D?,Second fact: the President's new budget for renewable energy,is barely a billion dollars in total.,Less than one day of Exxon's revenues.,Third fact: I bet you didn't know that there's enough energy,in hot rocks under the country to supply America's energy needs,for the next thousand years. And the federal budget,calls for a measly 20 million dollars of R&D in geothermal energy.,It is almost criminal that we are not investing more,in energy research in this country.,And I am really afraid that it's absolutely not enough. 
 So, in a year's worth of learning we found a bunch of surprises.,Who would have thought that a mass retailer,could make money by going green? Who would have thought that,a database entrepreneur could transform California with legislation?,Who would have thought that the ethanol biofuel miracle,would come from a developing country in South America?,And who would have thought that scientists,trying to cure malaria could come up with breakthroughs in biofuels?,And who would have thought that all that is not enough?,Not enough to stabilize the climate.,Not enough to keep the ice in Greenland from crashing into the ocean.,The scientists tell us -- and they're only guessing --,that we've got to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by one half,,and do it as fast as possible.,Now, we may have the political will to do this in the U.S.,,but I've got to tell you, we've got only one atmosphere,,and so somehow we're going to have to find the political will,to do this all around the world. The wild card in this deck is China. 
 To size the problem, China's CO2 emissions today are 3.3 gigatons;,the U.S. is 5.8. Business as usual means,we'll have 23 gigatons from China by 2050.,That's about as much CO2 as there is in the whole world.,And if it's business as usual, we're going out of business.,When I was in Davos, China's Mayor of Dalian was pressed,about their CO2 strategy, and he said the following,,"You know, Americans use seven times the CO2 per capita as Chinese.",Then he asked, "Why should China sacrifice our growth,so that the West can continue to be profligate and stupid?",Does anybody here have an answer for him? I don't.,We've got to make this economic so that all people and all nations,make the right outcome, the profitable outcome,,and therefore the likely outcome.,Energy's a six-trillion-dollar business worldwide.,It is the mother of all markets. You remember that Internet? 
 Well, I'll tell you what. Green technologies -- going green --,is bigger than the Internet.,It could be the biggest economic opportunity of the 21st century.,Moreover, if we succeed, it's going to be,the most important transformation for life on the planet since,,as Bill Joy says, we went from methane to oxygen in the atmosphere.,Now, here's the hard question, if the trajectory of all the world's,companies and individuals and policies and innovation,is not going to be enough, what are we going to do? I don't know.,Everyone here cares about changing the world,and has made a difference in that one way or another. 
 So, our call to action -- my call to you --,is for you to make going green your next big thing, your gig.,What can you do? You can personally get carbon neutral.,Go to ClimateCrisis.org or CarbonCalculator.com,and buy carbon credits. You could join other leaders in mandating,,lobbying for mandated cap and trade in U.S. greenhouse gas reductions.,There's six bills right now in Congress. Let's get one of them passed. 
 And the most important thing you can do, I think,,is to use your personal power and your Rolodex,to lead your business, your institution, in going green.,Do it like Wal-Mart, get it to go green,for its customers and its suppliers and for itself.,Really think outside the box.,Can you imagine what it would be like if Amazon or eBay or Google,or Microsoft or Apple really went green and you caused that to happen?,It could be bigger than Wal-Mart.,I can't wait to see what we TEDsters do about this crisis.,And I really, really hope that we multiply all of our energy,,all of our talent and all of our influence to solve this problem.,Because if we do, I can look forward,to the conversation I'm going to have with my daughter in 20 years.,(Applause)On simplicity. What a great way to start.,First of all, I've been watching this trend,where we have these books like such and such "For Dummies.",Do you know these books, these such and such "For Dummies?",My daughters pointed out that I'm very similar looking, so this is a bit of a problem.,(Laughter),But I was looking online at Amazon.com for other books like this.,You know, there's also something called the "Complete Idiot's Guide?",There's a sort of business model around being stupid in some sense.,We like to have technology make us feel bad, for some strange reason. 
 But I really like that, so I wrote a book called "The Laws of Simplicity.",I was in Milan last week, for the Italian launch.,It's kind of a book about questions, questions about simplicity.,Very few answers. I'm also wondering myself, what is simplicity?,Is it good? Is it bad? Is complexity better? I'm not sure. 
 After I wrote "The Laws of Simplicity,",I was very tired of simplicity, as you can imagine.,And so in my life, I've discovered that,vacation is the most important skill for any kind of over-achiever.,Because your companies will always take away your life,,but they can never take away your vacation -- in theory.,(Laughter) 
 So, I went to the Cape last summer to hide from simplicity,,and I went to the Gap, because I only have black pants.,So I went and bought khaki shorts or whatever,,and unfortunately, their branding was all about "Keep It Simple.",(Laughter),I opened up a magazine, and Visa's branding was,,"Business Takes Simplicity.",I develop photographs, and Kodak said, "Keep It Simple.",So, I felt kind of weird that simplicity was sort of following me around. 
 So, I turned on the TV, and I don't watch TV very much,,but you know this person? This is Paris Hilton, apparently.,And she has this show, "The Simple Life.",So I watched this. It's not very simple, a little bit confusing.,(Laughter),So, I looked for a different show to watch.,So, I opened up this TV Guide thing,,and on the E! channel, this "Simple Life" show is very popular.,They'll play it over, and over, and over.,(Laughter),So it was traumatizing, actually. 
 So, I wanted to escape again, so I went out to my car.,And Cape Cod, there are idyllic roads, and all of us can drive in this room.,And when you drive, these signs are very important.,It's a very simple sign, it says, "road" and "road approaching.",So I'm mostly driving along, okay, and then I saw this sign.,(Laughter),So, I thought complexity was attacking me suddenly,,so I thought, "Ah, simplicity. Very important." 
 But then I thought, "Oh, simplicity. What would that be like on a beach?,What if the sky was 41 percent gray? Wouldn't that be the perfect sky?",I mean that simplicity sky.,But in reality, the sky looked like this. It was a beautiful, complex sky. 
 You know, with the pinks and blues. We can't help but love complexity.,We're human beings: we love complex things.,We love relationships -- very complex. So we love this kind of stuff. 
 I'm at this place called the Media Lab.,Maybe some of you guys have heard of this place.,It's designed by I. M. Pei, one of the premier modernist architects.,Modernism means white box, and it's a perfect white box.,(Laughter),And some of you guys are entrepreneurs, etc., whatever.,Last month, I was at Google, and, boy, that cafeteria, man.,You guys have things here in Silicon Valley like stock options.,See, in academia, we get titles, lots of titles. 
 Last year at TED, these were all my titles. I had a lot of titles.,I have a default title as a father of a bunch of daughters.,This year at TED, I'm happy to report that I have new titles,,in addition to my previous titles.,Another "Associate Director of Research.",And this also happened, so I have five daughters now.,(Laughter),That's my baby Reina. (Applause) Thank you.,And so, my life is much more complex because of the baby, actually,,but that's okay. We will still stay married, I think. 
 But looking way back, when I was a child --,you see, I grew up in a tofu factory in Seattle.,Many of you may not like tofu because you haven't had good tofu,,but tofu's a good food. It's a very simple kind of food.,It's very hard work to make tofu.,As a child, we used to wake up at 1 a.m. and work till 6 p.m., six days a week.,My father was kind of like Andy Grove, paranoid of the competition.,So often, seven days a week. Family business equals child labor. 
 We were a great model. So, I loved going to school.,School was great, and maybe going to school,helped me get to this Media Lab place, I'm not sure.,(Laughter),Thank you.,But the Media Lab is an interesting place, and it's important to me,because as a student, I was a computer science undergrad,,and I discovered design later on in my life. 
 And there was this person, Muriel Cooper.,Who knows Muriel Cooper? Muriel Cooper?,Wasn't she amazing? Muriel Cooper. She was wacky.,And she was a TEDster, exactly, and she showed us,,she showed the world how to make the computer beautiful again.,And she's very important in my life,,because she's the one that told me to leave MIT and go to art school.,It was the best advice I ever got. So I went to art school, because of her.,She passed away in 1994,,and I was hired back to MIT to try to fill her shoes, but it's so hard.,This amazing person, Muriel Cooper. 
 When I was in Japan -- I went to an art school in Japan --,I had a nice sort of situation, because somehow I was connected to Paul Rand.,Some of you guys know Paul Rand,,the greatest graphic designer -- I'm sorry -- out there.,The great graphic designer Paul Rand,designed the IBM logo, the Westinghouse logo.,He basically said, "I've designed everything.",And also Ikko Tanaka was a very important mentor in my life --,the Paul Rand of Japan. He designed most of the major icons of Japan,,like Issey Miyake's brand and also Muji. 
 When you have mentors -- and yesterday,,Kareem Abdul-Jabbar talked about mentors,,these people in your life -- the problem with mentors is that they all die.,This is a sad thing, but it's actually a happy thing in a way,,because you can remember them in their pure form.,I think that the mentors that we all meet sort of humanize us.,When you get older, and you're all freaked out, whatever,,the mentors calm us down.,And I'm grateful for my mentors, and I'm sure all of you are too. 
 Because the human thing is very hard when you're at MIT.,The T doesn't stand for "human," it stands for "technology.",And because of that, I always wondered about this human thing.,So, I've always been Googling this word, "human,",to find out how many hits I get.,And in 2001, I had 26 million hits, and for "computer,",because computers are against humans a bit, 
 I have 42 million hits. Let me do an Al Gore here.,So, if you sort of compare that, like this,,you'll see that computer versus human --,I've been tracking this for the last year --,computer versus human over the last year has changed.,It used to be kind of two to one. Now, humans are catching up.,Very good, us humans! We're catching up with the computers.,In the simplicity realm, it's also interesting.,So if you compare complexities to simplicity,,it's also catching up in a way, too.,So, somehow humans and simplicity are intertwined, I think. 
 I have a confession: I'm not a man of simplicity.,I spent my entire early career making complex stuff.,Lots of complex stuff.,I wrote computer programs to make complex graphics like this.,I had clients in Japan to make really complex stuff like this.,And I've always felt bad about it, in a sense.,So, I hid in a time dimension.,I built things in a time-graphics dimension.,I did this series of calendars for Shiseido.,This is a floral theme calendar in 1997,,and this is a firework calendar. So, you launch the number into space,,because the Japanese believe that when you see fireworks,,you're cooler for some reason.,This is why they have fireworks in the summer.,A very extreme culture.,Lastly, this is a fall-based calendar,,because I have so many leaves in my yard.,So this is the leaves in my yard, essentially. 
 And so I made a lot of these types of things.,I've been lucky to have been there before people made these kind of things,,and so I made all this kind of stuff that messes with your eyes.,I feel kind of bad about that.,Tomorrow, Paola Antonelli is speaking. I love Paola.,She has this show right now at MoMA,,where some of these early works are here on display at MoMA, on the walls.,If you're in New York, please go and see that. 
 But I've had a problem, because I make all this flying stuff,and people say, "Oh, I know your work.,You're the guy that makes eye candy.",And when you're told this, you feel kind of weird.,"Eye candy" -- sort of pejorative, don't you think?,So, I say, "No, I make eye meat," instead.,(Laughter),And eye meat is something different, something more fibrous,,something more powerful, perhaps. But what could that be, eye meat? 
 I've been interested in computer programs all my life, actually.,Computer programs are essentially trees,,and when you make art with a computer program, there's kind of a problem.,Whenever you make art with a computer program,,you're always on the tree, and the paradox is that,for excellent art, you want to be off the tree.,So, this is sort of a complication I've found. 
 So, to get off the tree, I began to use my old computers.,I took these to Tokyo in 2001 to make computer objects.,This is a new way to type, on my old, color Classic.,You can't type very much on this.,I also discovered that an IR mouse responds to CRT emissions,and starts to move by itself, so this is a self-drawing machine.,And also, one year, the G3 Bondi Blue thing --,that caddy would come out, like, dangerous, like, "whack," like that.,But I thought, "This is very interesting. What if I make like a car crash test?",So I have a crash test.,(Laughter),And sort of measure the impact. Stuff like this are things I made,,just to sort of understand what these things are.,(Laughter) 
 Shortly after this, 9/11 happened, and I was very depressed.,I was concerned with contemporary art,that was all about piss, and sort of really sad things,,and so I wanted to think about something happy.,So I focused on food as my area --,these sort of clementine peel things.,In Japan, it's a wonderful thing to remove the clementine peel,just in one piece. Who's done that before? One-piece clementine?,Oh, you guys are missing out, if you haven't done it yet.,It was very good, and I discovered I can make sculptures out of this,,actually, in different forms.,If you dry them quick, you can make, like, elephants and steers and stuff,,and my wife didn't like these, because they mold, so I had to stop that. 
 So, I went back to the computer, and I bought five large fries,,and scanned them all. And I was looking for some kind of food theme,,and I wrote some software to automatically lay out french-fry images.,And as a child, I'd hear that song, you know,,"Oh, beautiful, for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain,",so I made this amber waves image.,It's sort of a Midwest cornfield out of french fries. 
 And also, as a child, I was the fattest kid in class,,so I used to love Cheetos. Oh, I love Cheetos, yummy.,So, I wanted to play with Cheetos in some way.,I wasn't sure where to go with this. I invented Cheeto paint.,Cheeto paint is a very simple way to paint with Cheetos.,(Laughter),I discovered that Cheetos are good, expressive material.,And with these Cheetos, I began to think,,"What can I make with these Cheetos?" 
 And so, I began to crinkle up potato chip flecks, and also pretzels.,I was looking for some kind of form,,and in the end, I made 100 butter-fries. Do you get it?,(Laughter),And each butter-fry is composed of different pieces.,People ask me how they make the antenna.,Sometimes, they find a hair in the food. That's my hair.,My hair's clean -- it's okay. 
 I'm a tenured professor, which means, basically, I don't have to work anymore.,It's a strange business model. I can come into work everyday,and staple five pieces of paper and just stare at it with my latte.,End of story.,(Laughter),But I realized that life could be very boring,,so I've been thinking about life, and I notice that my camera --,my digital camera versus my car, a very strange thing.,The car is so big, the camera is so small,,yet the manual for the camera is so much bigger than the car manual.,It doesn't make any sense.,(Laughter) 
 So, I was in the Cape one time, and I typed the word "simplicity,",and I discovered, in this weird, M. Night Shyamalan way,,that I discovered [the] letters, M, I, T. You know the word?,In the words "simplicity" and "complexity," M, I, T occur in perfect sequence.,It's a bit eerie, isn't it?,So, I thought, maybe I'll do this for the next twenty years or something. 
 And I wrote this book, "The Laws of Simplicity.",It's a very short, simple book. There are ten laws and three keys.,The ten laws and three keys -- I won't go over them because that's why I have a book,,and also that's why it's on the Web for free.,But the laws are kind of like sushi in a way: there are all kinds.,In Japan, they say that sushi is challenging.,You know the uni is the most challenging, so number ten is challenging.,People hate number ten like they hate uni, actually.,The three keys are easy to eat, so this is anago, cooked already, so easy to eat.,So enjoy your sushi meal later, with the laws of simplicity.,Because I want to simplify them for you.,Because that's what this is about. I have to simplify this thing. 
 So, if I simplify the laws of simplicity,,I have what's called the cookie versus laundry thing.,Anyone who has kids knows that if you offer a kid,a big cookie or a small cookie,,which cookie are they going to take? The big cookie.,You can say the small cookie has Godiva chocolate bits in it,,but it doesn't work. They want the big cookie.,But if you offer kids two piles of laundry to fold,,the small pile or the big pile, which will they choose? 
 Strangely, not the big pile. So, I think it's as simple as this.,You know, when you want more, it's because you want to enjoy it.,When you want less, it's because it's about work.,And so, to boil it all down, simplicity is about living life,with more enjoyment and less pain.,I think this is sort of simple more versus less.,Basically, it always depends.,This book I wrote because I want to figure out life.,I love life. I love being alive. I like to see things.,And so life is a big question, I think, in simplicity,,because you're trying to simplify your life. 
 And I just love to see the world. The world is an amazing place.,By being at TED, we see so many things at one time.,And I can't help but enjoy looking at everything in the world.,Like everything you see, every time you wake up.,It's such a joy to sort of experience everything in the world.,From everything from a weird hotel lobby,,to Saran wrap placed over your window,,to this moment where I had my road in front of my house paved dark black,,and this white moth was sitting there dying in the sun. 
 And so, this whole thing has struck me as exciting to be here,,because life is finite.,This was given to me by the chairman of Shiseido.,He's an expert in aging. This horizontal axis is how old you are --,twelve years old, twenty-four years old, seventy-four, ninety-six years old --,and this is some medical data. So, brain strength increases up to 60,,and then after 60, it sort of goes down. Kind of depressing in a way. 
 Also, if you look at your physical strength.,You know, I have a lot of cocky freshmen at MIT, so I tell them,,"Oh, your bodies are really getting stronger and stronger,,but in your late twenties and mid-thirties, cells, they die.",OK. It gets them to work harder, sometimes.,And if you have your vision, vision is interesting.,As you age from infant age, your vision gets better,,and maybe in your late teens, early twenties, you're looking for a mate,,and your vision goes after that.,(Laughter) 
 Your social responsibility is very interesting.,So, as you get older, you may, like, have kids, whatever.,And then the kids graduate, and you have no responsibility any more --,that's very good, too. 
 But if any of you people ask,,"What actually goes up? Does anything go up?,What's the positive part of this, you know?" I think wisdom always goes up.,I love these eighty-year-old, ninety-year-old guys and women.,They have so many thoughts, and they have so much wisdom,,and I think -- you know, this TED thing, I've come here.,And this is the fourth time, and I come here for this wisdom, I think.,This whole TED effect, it sort of ups your wisdom, somehow.,And I'm so glad to be here, and I'm very grateful to be here, Chris.,And this is an amazing experience for me as well.You know, what I do is write for children,,and I'm probably America's,most widely read children's author, in fact.,And I always tell people,that I don't want to show up looking like a scientist.,You can have me as a farmer, or in leathers,,and no one has ever chose farmer.,I'm here today to talk to you,about circles and epiphanies.,And you know, an epiphany,is usually something you find that you dropped someplace.,You've just got to go around the block,to see it as an epiphany. 
 That's a painting of a circle.,A friend of mine did that -- Richard Bollingbroke.,It's the kind of complicated circle,that I'm going to tell you about.,My circle began back in the '60s,in high school in Stow, Ohio,where I was the class queer.,I was the guy beaten up bloody,every week in the boys' room,,until one teacher saved my life.,She saved my life by letting me go to the bathroom,in the teachers' lounge.,She did it in secret.,She did it for three years.,And I had to get out of town.,I had a thumb, I had 85 dollars,,and I ended up in San Francisco, California --,met a lover --,and back in the '80s, found it necessary,to begin work on AIDS organizations. 
 About three or four years ago,,I got a phone call in the middle of the night,from that teacher, Mrs. Posten,,who said, "I need to see you.,I'm disappointed,that we never got to know each other as adults.,Could you please come to Ohio,,and please bring that man,that I know you have found by now.,And I should mention,that I have pancreatic cancer,,and I'd like you to please,be quick about this." 
 Well, the next day we were in Cleveland.,We took a look at her, we laughed, we cried,,and we knew that she needed to be in a hospice.,We found her one, we got her there,,and we took care of her,and watched over her family,,because it was necessary.,It's something we knew how to do.,And just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult,got to know me,,she turned into a box of ashes,and was placed in my hands.,And what had happened,was the circle had closed,,it had become a circle --,and that epiphany I talked about,presented itself. 
 The epiphany is,that death is a part of life.,She saved my life;,I and my partner saved hers.,And you know, that part of life needs everything,that the rest of life does.,It needs truth and beauty,,and I'm so happy it's been mentioned so much here today.,It also needs --,it needs dignity,,love and pleasure,,and it's our job to hand those things out. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So I really consider myself a storyteller.,But I don't really tell stories in the usual way,,in the sense that I don't usually tell my own stories.,Instead, I'm really interested in building tools that allow,large numbers of other people to tell their stories,,people all around the world.,I do this because I think that people actually have a lot in common.,I think people are very similar,,but I also think that we have trouble seeing that. 
 You know, as I look around the world I see a lot of gaps,,and I think we all see a lot of gaps.,And we define ourselves by our gaps.,There's language gaps,,there's ethnicity and racial gaps, there's age gaps,,there's gender gaps, there's sexuality gaps,,there's wealth and money gaps, there's education gaps,,there's also religious gaps.,You know, we have all these gaps and I think we like our gaps,because they make us feel like we identify with something,,some smaller community.,But I think that actually, despite our gaps,,we really have a lot in common.,And I think one thing we have in common is a very deep need,to express ourselves.,I think this is a very old human desire. It's nothing new. 
 But the thing about self-expression,is that there's traditionally been this imbalance,between the desire that we have to express ourselves,and the number of sympathetic friends,who are willing to stand around and listen. 
 (Laughter) 
 This, also, is nothing new.,Since the dawn of human history, we've tried to rectify this imbalance,by making art, writing poems, singing songs,,scripting editorials and sending them in to a newspaper,,gossiping with friends. This is nothing new. 
 What's new is that in the last several years,a lot of these very traditional physical human activities,,these acts of self-expression, have been moving onto the Internet.,And as that's happened, people have been leaving behind footprints,,footprints that tell stories of their moments of self-expression.,And so what I do is, I write computer programs,that study very large sets of these footprints,,and then try to draw conclusions about the people who left them --,what they feel, what they think,,what's different in the world today than usual,,these sorts of questions. 
 One project that explores these ideas,,which was made about a year ago,,is a piece called We Feel Fine.,This is a piece that every two or three minutes,scans the world's newly-posted blog entries,for occurrences of the phrases "I feel" or "I am feeling.",And when it finds one of those phrases,,it grabs the sentence up to the period,,and then automatically tries to deduce the age, gender,and geographical location of the person that wrote that sentence.,Then, knowing the geographical location and the time,,we can also then figure out the weather,when that person wrote the sentence.,All of this information is saved in a database,that collects about 20,000 feelings a day.,It's been running for about a year and a half.,It's reached about seven-and-a-half million human feelings now.,And I'll show you a glimpse,of how this information is then visualized. So this is We Feel Fine. 
 What you see here is a madly swarming mass of particles,,each of which represents a single human feeling,that was stated in the last few hours.,The color of each particle corresponds to the type of feeling inside --,so that happy, positive feelings are brightly colored.,And sad, negative feelings are darkly colored.,The diameter of each dot,represents the length of the sentence inside,,so that the large dots contain large sentences,,and the small dots contain small sentences.,Any dot can be clicked and expanded. And we see here,,"I would just feel so much better,if I could curl up in his arms right now and feel his affection for me,in the embrace of his body and the tenderness of his lips.",So it gets pretty hot and steamy sometimes,in the world of human emotions.,And all of these are stated by people:,"I know that objectively it really doesn't mean much,,but after spending so many years as a small fish in a big pond,,it's nice to feel bigger again." 
 The dots exhibit human qualities. They kind of have their own physics,,and they swarm wildly around, kind of exploring the world of life.,And then they also exhibit curiosity.,You can see a few of them are swarming around the cursor right now.,You can see some other ones,are swarming around the bottom left corner of the screen,around six words. Those six words represent the six movements,of We Feel Fine. We're currently seeing Madness.,There's also Murmurs, Montage, Mobs, Metrics and Mounds.,And I'll walk you through a few of those now.,Murmurs causes all of the feelings to fly to the ceiling.,And then, one by one, in reverse chronological order,,they excuse themselves, entering the scrolling list of feelings.,"I feel a bit better now." 
 (Laughter) 
 "I feel confused and unsure of what the hell I want to do.","I feel gypped out of something awesome here.","I feel so free; I feel so good.","I feel like I'm in this fog of depression that I can't get out of.",And you can click any of these to go out and visit the blog,from which it was collected. And in that way,,you can connect with the authors of these statements,if you feel some degree of empathy. 
 The next movement is called Montage.,Montage causes all of the feelings that contain photographs,to become extracted and display themselves in a grid.,This grid is then said to represent the picture of the world's feelings,in the last few hours, if you will.,Each of these can be clicked and we can blow it up.,We see, "I just feel like I'm not going to have fun,if it's not the both of us." That was from someone in Michigan.,We see, "I feel like I have been at a computer all day." 
 (Laughter) 
 These are automatically constructed using the found objects:,"I think I feel a little full." 
 The next movement is called mobs.,Mobs provides different statistical breakdowns,of the population of the world's feelings in the last few hours.,We see that "better" is the most frequent feeling right now,,followed by "good," "bad," "guilty," "right," "down," "sick" and so on.,We can also get a gender breakdown.,And we see that women are slightly more prolific,talking about their emotions in the last few hours than men.,We can do an age breakdown, which gives us a histogram,of the world's emotional distribution by age.,We see people in their twenties are the most prolific,,followed by teenagers, and then people in their thirties,,and it dies out very quickly from there.,In weather, the feelings assume the physical characteristics,of the weather that they represent,,so that the ones collected on a sunny day,swirl around as if they're part of the sun.,The cloudy ones float along as if they're on a breeze.,The rainy ones fall down as if they're in a rainstorm,,and the snowy ones kind of flutter to the ground. 
 Finally, location causes the feelings to move to their positions,on a world map showing the geographical distribution of feelings.,Metrics provides more numerical views on the data.,We see that the world is feeling "used",at 3.3 times the normal level right now. 
 (Laughter) 
 They're feeling "warm" at 2.9 times the normal level, and so on.,Other views are also available.,Here are gender, age, weather, location. 
 The final movement is called Mounds.,It's a bit different from the others.,Mounds visualizes the entire dataset as large, gelatinous blobs,which kind of jiggle.,And if I hold down my cursor, they do a little dance.,We see "better" is the most frequent feeling, followed by "bad.",And then if I go over here, the list begins to scroll,,and there are actually thousands of feelings that have been collected.,You can see the little pink cursor moving along,,representing our position.,Here we see people that feel "slipping," "nauseous," "responsible." 
 There's also a search capability,,if you're interested in finding out about a certain population.,For instance, you could find women who feel "addicted",in their 20s when it was cloudy in Bangladesh. 
 (Laughter) 
 But I'll spare you that.,So here are some of my favorite montages that have been collected:,"I feel so much of my dad alive in me that there isn't even room for me.","I feel very lonely.","I need to be in some backwoods redneck town,so that I can feel beautiful.","I feel invisible to you.","I wouldn't hide it if society didn't make me feel like I needed to.","I feel in love with Carolyn." "I feel so naughty.","I feel these weirdoes are actually an asset to college life." 
 (Laughter) 
 "I love how I feel today." 
 So as you can see, We Feel Fine uses a technique,that I call "passive observation.",What I mean by that is that it passively observes people,as they live their lives. It scans the world's blogs,and looks at what people are writing,,and these people don't know they're being watched or interviewed.,And because of that,,you end up getting very honest, candid, sincere responses,that are often very moving.,And this is a technique that I usually prefer in my work,because people don't know they're being interviewed.,They're just living life, and they end up just acting like that. 
 Another technique is directly questioning people.,And this is a technique that I explored in a different project,,the Yahoo! Time Capsule,,which was designed to take a fingerprint of the world in 2006.,It was divided into ten very simple themes --,love, anger, sadness and so on --,each of which contained a single, very open-ended question,put to the world: What do you love? What makes you angry?,What makes you sad? What do you believe in? And so on.,The time capsule was available for one month online,,translated into 10 languages, and this is what it looked like.,It's a spinning globe,,the surface of which is entirely composed of the pictures,and words and drawings of people,that submitted to the time capsule.,The ten themes radiate out and orbit the time capsule.,You can sift through this data and see what people have submitted.,This is in response to, What's beautiful? "Miss World." 
 There are two modes to the time capsule.,There's One World, which presents the spinning globe,,and Many Voices, which splits the data out into film strips,and lets you sift through them one by one.,So this project was punctuated by a really amazing event,,which was held in the desert outside Albuquerque in New Mexico,at the Jemez Pueblo, where for three consecutive nights,,the contents of the capsule were projected onto the sides,of the ancient Red Rock Canyon walls,,which stand about 200 feet tall. It was really incredible.,And we also projected the contents of the time capsule,as binary code using a 35-watt laser into outer space.,You can see the orange line leaving the desert floor,at about a 45 degree angle there. This was amazing,because the first night I looked at all this information,and really started seeing the gaps that I talked about earlier --,the differences in age, gender and wealth and so on. 
 But, you know, as I looked at this more and more and more,,and saw these images go across the rocks,,I realized I was seeing the same archetypal events,depicted again and again and again.,You know: weddings, births, funerals, the first car, the first kiss,,the first camel or horse -- depending on the culture.,And it was really moving. And this picture here was taken,the final night from a distant cliff about two miles away,,where the contents of the capsule were being beamed into space.,And there was something very moving,about all of this human expression being shot off into the night sky. 
 And it started to make me think a lot about the night sky,,and how humans have always used the night sky,to project their great stories.,You know, as a child in Vermont, on a farm where I grew up,,I would often look up into the dark sky,and see the three star belt of Orion, the Hunter.,And as an adult, I've been more aware,of the great Greek myths playing out in the sky overhead every night.,You know, Orion facing the roaring bull.,Perseus flying to the rescue of Andromeda.,Zeus battling Chronos for control of Mount Olympus.,I mean, these are the great tales of the Greeks. 
 And it caused me to wonder about our world today.,And it caused me to wonder specifically,,if we could make new constellations today,,what would those look like? What would those be?,If we could make new pictures in the sky, what would we draw?,What are the great stories of today? 
 And those are the questions that inspired my new project,,which is debuting here today at TED.,Nobody's seen this yet, publicly.,It's called Universe: Revealing Our Modern Mythology.,And it uses this metaphor of an interactive night sky.,So, it's my great pleasure now to show this to you. 
 So, Universe will open here.,And you'll see that it leads with a shifting star field,,and there's an Aurora Borealis in the background,,kind of morphing with color. The color of the Aurora Borealis,can be controlled using this single bar of color at the bottom,,and we'll put it down here to red.,So you see this kind of -- these stars moving along. 
 Now, these aren't just little points of light, little pixels.,Each of those stars actually represents,a specific event in the real world --,a quote that was stated by somebody, an image,,a news story, a person, a company. You know,,some kind of heroic personality.,And you might notice that as the cursor begins,to touch some of these stars, that shapes begin to emerge.,We see here there's a little man walking along, or maybe a woman.,And we see here a photograph with a head.,You can start to see words emerging here.,And those are,the constellations of today.,And I can turn them all on,,and you can see them moving across the sky now. 
 This is the universe of 2007, the last two months.,The data from this is global news coverage,from thousands of news sources around the world.,It's using the API of a really great company that I work with,in New York, actually, called Daylife.,And it's kind of the zeitgeist view at this level,of the world's current mythology over the last couple of months. 
 So we can see where it's emerging here, like President Ford,,Iraq, Bush. And we can actually isolate just the words --,I call them secrets -- and we can cause them to form,an alphabetical list. And we see Anna Nicole Smith,playing a big role recently.,President Ford -- this is Gerald Ford's funeral.,We can actually click anything in Universe,and have it become the center of the universe,,and everything else will enter its orbit.,So, we'll click Ford, and now that becomes the center.,And the things that relate to Ford enter its orbit,and swirl around it. 
 We can isolate just the photographs, and we now see those.,We can click on one of those,and have the photograph be the center of the universe.,Now the things that relate to it are swirling around.,We can click on this and we see this iconic image,of Betty Ford kissing her husband's coffin. 
 In Universe, there's kind of no end. It just goes infinitely,,and you can just kind of click on stuff.,This is a photographic representation, called Snapshots.,But we can actually be more specific in defining our universe.,So, if we want to,,let's check out what Bill Clinton's universe looks like.,And let's see, in the past week, what he's been up to.,So now, we have a new universe, which is just constrained,to all things Bill Clinton.,We can have his constellations emerge here.,We can pull out his secrets,,and we see that it has a lot to do with candidates,,Hillary, presidential, Barack Obama.,We can see the stories,that Bill Clinton is taking part in right now.,Any of those can be opened up.,So we see Obama and the Clintons meet in Alabama.,You can see that this is an important story;,there are a lot of things in its orbit. If we open this up,,we get different perspectives on this story.,You can click any of those to go out and read the article,at the source. This one's from Al Jazeera. 
 We can also see the superstars. These would be the people,that are kind of the looming heroes and heroines,in the universe of Bill Clinton. So there's Bill Clinton, Hillary,,Iraq, George Bush, Barack Obama, Scooter Libby --,these are kind of the people of Bill Clinton.,We can also see a world map, so this shows us the geographic reach,of Bill Clinton in the last week or so.,We can see he's been focused in America,because he's been campaigning, probably,,but a little bit of action over here in the Middle East.,And then we can also see a timeline.,So we see that he was a bit quiet on Saturday,,but he was back to work on Sunday morning,,and actually been tapering off since then this week. 
 And it's not limited to just people or dates,,but we can actually put in concepts also.,So if I put in climate change for all of 2006,,we'll see what that universe looks like.,Here we have our star field. Here we have our shapes.,Here we have our secrets.,So we see again, climate change is large:,Nairobi, global conference, environmental.,And there are also quotes that you can see,,if you're interested in reading about quotes on climate change.,You know, this is really an infinite thing. 
 The superstars of climate change in 2006:,United States, Britain, China. You know,,these are the towering countries that kind of define this concept.,So this is a piece that demands exploration. 
 This will be online in several days, probably next Tuesday.,And you'll all be able to use it and kind of explore,what your own personal mythology might be.,You'll notice that in Daylife -- rather, in Universe --,it supports both the notion of a global mythology,,which is represented by something as broad as, say, 2007,,and also a personal mythology.,As you search for the things that are important to you in your world,,and then see what the constellations of those might look like. 
 So it's been a pleasure. Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)(Applause) 
 (Music) 
 (Applause)So I thought, "I will talk about death.",Seemed to be the passion today.,Actually, it's not about death.,It's inevitable, terrible, but really what I want to talk about is,,I'm just fascinated by the legacy people leave when they die.,That's what I want to talk about. 
 So Art Buchwald left his legacy of humor with a video,that appeared soon after he died, saying,,"Hi! I'm Art Buchwald, and I just died.",And Mike, who I met at Galapagos, a trip which I won at TED,,is leaving notes on cyberspace where he is chronicling,his journey through cancer.,And my father left me a legacy of his handwriting,through letters and a notebook.,In the last two years of his life, when he was sick,,he filled a notebook with his thoughts about me.,He wrote about my strengths, weaknesses,,and gentle suggestions for improvement,,quoting specific incidents, and held a mirror to my life. 
 After he died, I realized that no one writes to me anymore.,Handwriting is a disappearing art.,I'm all for email and thinking while typing,,but why give up old habits for new?,Why can't we have letter writing and email exchange in our lives?,There are times when I want to trade all those years,that I was too busy to sit with my dad and chat with him,,and trade all those years for one hug.,But too late.,But that's when I take out his letters and I read them,,and the paper that touched his hand is in mine,,and I feel connected to him. 
 So maybe we all need to leave our children,with a value legacy, and not a financial one.,A value for things with a personal touch --,an autographed book, a soul-searching letter.,If a fraction of this powerful TED audience,could be inspired to buy a beautiful paper --,John, it'll be a recycled one -- and write a beautiful letter,to someone they love, we actually may start a revolution,where our children may go to penmanship classes. 
 So what do I plan to leave for my son?,I collect autographed books, and those of you authors,in the audience know I hound you for them --,and CDs too, Tracy.,I plan to publish my own notebook.,As I witnessed my father's body being swallowed by fire,,I sat by his funeral pyre and wrote.,I have no idea how I'm going to do it,,but I am committed to compiling his thoughts and mine,into a book, and leave that published book for my son. 
 I'd like to end with a few verses of what I wrote,at my father's cremation.,And those linguists, please pardon the grammar,,because I've not looked at it in the last 10 years.,I took it out for the first time to come here.,"Picture in a frame, ashes in a bottle,,boundless energy confined in the bottle,,forcing me to deal with reality,,forcing me to deal with being grown up.,I hear you and I know that you would want me to be strong,,but right now, I am being sucked down, surrounded,and suffocated by these raging emotional waters,,craving to cleanse my soul, trying to emerge,on a firm footing one more time, to keep on fighting and flourishing,just as you taught me.,Your encouraging whispers in my whirlpool of despair,,holding me and heaving me to shores of sanity,,to live again and to love again.",Thank you.(Applause),I want to talk to you a little bit about user-generated content.,I'm going to tell you three stories on the way to one argument,that's going to tell you a little bit,about how we open user-generated content up for business.,So, here's the first story. 
 1906. This man, John Philip Sousa, traveled to this place,,the United States Capitol, to talk about this technology,,what he called the, quote, "talking machines.",Sousa was not a fan of the talking machines.,This is what he had to say.,"These talking machines are going to ruin artistic development,of music in this country.,When I was a boy, in front of every house in the summer evenings,,you would find young people together,singing the songs of the day, or the old songs.,Today, you hear these infernal machines going night and day.,We will not have a vocal chord left," Sousa said.,"The vocal chords will be eliminated by a process of evolution,as was the tail of man when he came from the ape." 
 Now, this is the picture I want you to focus on.,This is a picture of culture.,We could describe it using modern computer terminology,as a kind of read-write culture.,It's a culture where people participate in the creation,and the re-creation of their culture. In that sense, it's read-write.,Sousa's fear was that we would lose that capacity,because of these, quote, "infernal machines." They would take it away.,And in its place, we'd have the opposite of read-write culture,,what we could call read-only culture.,Culture where creativity was consumed,but the consumer is not a creator.,A culture which is top-down, owned,,where the vocal chords of the millions have been lost. 
 Now, as you look back at the twentieth century,,at least in what we think of as the, quote, "developed world" --,hard not to conclude that Sousa was right.,Never before in the history of human culture,had it been as professionalized, never before as concentrated.,Never before has creativity of the millions,been as effectively displaced,,and displaced because of these, quote, "infernal machines.",The twentieth century was that century,where, at least for those places we know the best,,culture moved from this read-write to read-only existence. 
 So, second. Land is a kind of property --,it is property. It's protected by law.,As Lord Blackstone described it, land is protected by trespass law,,for most of the history of trespass law,,by presuming it protects the land all the way down below,and to an indefinite extent upward.,Now, that was a pretty good system,for most of the history of the regulation of land,,until this technology came along, and people began to wonder,,were these instruments trespassers,as they flew over land without clearing the rights,of the farms below as they traveled across the country?,Well, in 1945, Supreme Court got a chance to address that question. 
 Two farmers, Thomas Lee and Tinie Causby, who raised chickens,,had a significant complaint because of these technologies.,The complaint was that their,chickens followed the pattern of the airplanes,and flew themselves into the walls of the barn,when the airplanes flew over the land.,And so they appealed to Lord Blackstone,to say these airplanes were trespassing.,Since time immemorial, the law had said,,you can't fly over the land without permission of the landowner,,so this flight must stop.,Well, the Supreme Court considered this 100-years tradition,and said, in an opinion written by Justice Douglas,,that the Causbys must lose.,The Supreme Court said the doctrine protecting land,all the way to the sky has no place in the modern world,,otherwise every transcontinental flight would,subject the operator to countless trespass suits.,Common sense, a rare idea in the law, but here it was. Common sense --,(Laughter) --,Revolts at the idea. Common sense. 
 Finally. Before the Internet, the last great terror,to rain down on the content industry,was a terror created by this technology. Broadcasting:,a new way to spread content,,and therefore a new battle over the control,of the businesses that would spread content.,Now, at that time, the entity,,the legal cartel, that controlled the performance rights,for most of the music that would be broadcast,using these technologies was ASCAP.,They had an exclusive license on the most popular content,,and they exercised it in a way that tried to demonstrate,to the broadcasters who really was in charge.,So, between 1931 and 1939, they raised rates by some 448 percent,,until the broadcasters finally got together,and said, okay, enough of this.,And in 1939, a lawyer, Sydney Kaye, started something,called Broadcast Music Inc. We know it as BMI.,And BMI was much more democratic in the art,that it would include within its repertoire,,including African American music for the first time in the repertoire.,But most important was that BMI took public domain works,and made arrangements of them, which they gave away for free,to their subscribers. So that in 1940,,when ASCAP threatened to double their rates,,the majority of broadcasters switched to BMI.,Now, ASCAP said they didn't care.,The people will revolt, they predicted, because the very best music,was no longer available, because they had shifted,to the second best public domain provided by BMI.,Well, they didn't revolt, and in 1941, ASCAP cracked.,And the important point to recognize,is that even though these broadcasters,were broadcasting something you would call second best,,that competition was enough to break, at that time,,this legal cartel over access to music. 
 Okay. Three stories. Here's the argument.,In my view, the most significant thing to recognize,about what this Internet is doing,is its opportunity to revive the read-write culture,that Sousa romanticized.,Digital technology is the opportunity,for the revival of these vocal chords,that he spoke so passionately to Congress about.,User-generated content, spreading in businesses,in extraordinarily valuable ways like these,,celebrating amateur culture.,By which I don't mean amateurish culture,,I mean culture where people produce,for the love of what they're doing and not for the money.,I mean the culture that your kids are producing all the time.,For when you think of what Sousa romanticized,in the young people together, singing the songs of the day,,of the old songs, you should recognize,what your kids are doing right now.,Taking the songs of the day and the old songs,and remixing them to make them something different.,It's how they understand access to this culture.,So, let's have some very few examples,to get a sense of what I'm talking about here. 
 Here's something called Anime Music Video, first example,,taking anime captured from television,re-edited to music tracks.,(Music),This one you should be -- confidence. Jesus survives. Don't worry.,(Music),(Laughter),And this is the best.,(Music),My love ...,There's only you in my life ...,The only thing that's bright ...,My first love ...,You're every breath that I take ...,You're every step I make ...,And I ....,I want to share all my love with you ...,No one else will do ...,And your eyes ...,They tell me how much you care ...,(Music),So, this is remix, right?,(Applause),And it's important to emphasize that what this is not,is not what we call, quote, "piracy.",I'm not talking about nor justifying,people taking other people's content in wholesale,and distributing it without the permission of the copyright owner.,I'm talking about people taking and recreating,using other people's content, using digital technologies,to say things differently.,Now, the importance of this,is not the technique that you've seen here.,Because, of course, every technique that you've seen here,is something that television and film producers,have been able to do for the last 50 years.,The importance is that that technique has been democratized.,It is now anybody with access to a $1,500 computer,who can take sounds and images from the culture around us,and use it to say things differently.,These tools of creativity have become tools of speech.,It is a literacy for this generation. This is how our kids speak.,It is how our kids think. It is what your kids are,as they increasingly understand digital technologies,and their relationship to themselves. 
 Now, in response to this new use of culture using digital technologies,,the law has not greeted this Sousa revival,with very much common sense.,Instead, the architecture of copyright law,and the architecture of digital technologies,,as they interact, have produced the presumption,that these activities are illegal.,Because if copyright law at its core regulates something called copies,,then in the digital world the one fact we can't escape,is that every single use of culture produces a copy.,Every single use therefore requires permission;,without permission, you are a trespasser.,You're a trespasser with about as much sense,as these people were trespassers.,Common sense here, though, has not yet revolted,in response to this response that the law has offered,to these forms of creativity.,Instead, what we've seen,is something much worse than a revolt.,There's a growing extremism that comes from both sides,in this debate, in response to this conflict,between the law and the use of these technologies. 
 One side builds new technologies, such as one recently announced,that will enable them,to automatically take down from sites like YouTube,any content that has any copyrighted content in it,,whether or not there's a judgment of fair use,that might be applied to the use of that content.,And on the other side, among our kids,,there's a growing copyright abolitionism,,a generation that rejects the very notion,of what copyright is supposed to do, rejects copyright,and believes that the law is nothing more than an ass,to be ignored and to be fought at every opportunity possible.,The extremism on one side begets extremism on the other,,a fact we should have learned many, many times over,,and both extremes in this debate are just wrong.,Now, the balance that I try to fight for,,I, as any good liberal, try to fight for first,by looking to the government. Total mistake, right?,(Laughter) 
 Looked first to the courts and the legislatures to try to get them,to do something to make the system make more sense.,It failed partly because the courts are too passive,,partly because the legislatures are corrupted,,by which I don't mean that there's bribery,operating to stop real change,,but more the economy of influence that governs how Congress functions,means that policymakers here will not understand this,until it's too late to fix it.,So, we need something different, we need a different kind of solution.,And the solution here, in my view, is a private solution,,a solution that looks to legalize what it is to be young again,,and to realize the economic potential of that,,and that's where the story of BMI becomes relevant.,Because, as BMI demonstrated, competition here,can achieve some form of balance. The same thing can happen now.,We don't have a public domain to draw upon now,,so instead what we need is two types of changes. 
 First, that artists and creators embrace the idea,,choose that their work be made available more freely.,So, for example, they can say their work is available freely,for non-commercial, this amateur-type of use,,but not freely for any commercial use.,And second, we need the businesses,that are building out this read-write culture,to embrace this opportunity expressly, to enable it,,so that this ecology of free content, or freer content,,can grow on a neutral platform,where they both exist simultaneously,,so that more-free can compete with less-free,,and the opportunity to develop the creativity in that competition,can teach one the lessons of the other. 
 Now, I would talk about one particular such plan,that I know something about,,but I don't want to violate TED's first commandment of selling,,so I'm not going to talk about this at all.,I'm instead just going to remind you of the point that BMI teaches us.,That artist choice is the key for new technology,having an opportunity to be open for business,,and we need to build artist choice here,if these new technologies are to have that opportunity.,But let me end with something I think much more important --,much more important than business.,It's the point about how this connects to our kids.,We have to recognize they're different from us. This is us, right?,(Laughter),We made mixed tapes; they remix music.,We watched TV; they make TV. 
 It is technology that has made them different,,and as we see what this technology can do,,we need to recognize you can't kill,the instinct the technology produces. We can only criminalize it.,We can't stop our kids from using it.,We can only drive it underground.,We can't make our kids passive again.,We can only make them, quote, "pirates." And is that good?,We live in this weird time. It's kind of age of prohibitions,,where in many areas of our life,,we live life constantly against the law.,Ordinary people live life against the law,,and that's what I -- we are doing to our kids.,They live life knowing they live it against the law.,That realization is extraordinarily corrosive,,extraordinarily corrupting.,And in a democracy, we ought to be able to do better.,Do better, at least for them, if not for opening for business.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)What I am always thinking about,is what this session is about, which is called simplicity.,And almost, I would almost call it being simple-minded,,but in the best sense of the word.,I'm trying to figure out two very simple things:,how to live and how to die, period.,That's all I'm trying to do, all day long.,And I'm also trying to have some meals, and have some snacks,,and, you know, and yell at my children, and do all the normal things,that keep you grounded. 
 So, I was fortunate enough to be born a very dreamy child.,My older sister was busy torturing my parents,,and they were busy torturing her.,I was lucky enough to be completely ignored,,which is a fabulous thing, actually, I want to tell you.,So, I was able to completely daydream my way through my life.,And I finally daydreamed my way into NYU, at a very good time, in 1967,,where I met a man who was trying to blow up the math building of NYU.,And I was writing terrible poetry and knitting sweaters for him.,And feminists hated us, and the whole thing was wretched,from beginning to end.,But I kept writing bad poetry, and he didn't blow up the math building,,but he went to Cuba.,But I gave him the money, because I was from Riverdale,so I had more money than he did.,(Laughter),And that was a good thing to help, you know, the cause.,But, then he came back, and things happened,,and I decided I really hated my writing,,that it was awful, awful, purple prose.,And I decided that I wanted to tell --,but I still wanted to tell a narrative story,and I still wanted to tell my stories.,So I decided that I would start to draw. How hard could that be?,And so what happened was that I started,just becoming an editorial illustrator through, you know,,sheer whatever, sheer ignorance. 
 And we started a studio.,Well, Tibor really started the studio, called M&Co.,And the premise of M&Co was, we don't know anything,,but that's all right, we're going to do it anyway.,And as a matter of fact, it's better not to know anything,,because if you know too much, you're stymied.,So, the premise in the studio was,,there are no boundaries, there is no fear.,And I -- and my full-time job, I landed the best job on Earth,,was to daydream, and to actually come up with absurd ideas,that -- fortunately, there were enough people there,,and it was a team, it was a collective,,it was not just me coming up with crazy ideas.,But the point was that I was there as myself, as a dreamer.,And so some of the things -- I mean, it was a long history of M&Co,,and clearly we also needed to make some money,,so we decided we would create a series of products.,And some of the watches there,,attempting to be beautiful and humorous --,maybe not attempting, hopefully succeeding.,That to be able to talk about content,,to break apart what you normally expect, to use humor and surprise,,elegance and humanity in your work was really important to us.,It was a very high, it was a very impersonal time in design,and we wanted to say, the content is what's important,,not the package, not the wrapping.,You really have to be journalists, you have to be inventors,,you have to use your imagination more importantly than anything. 
 So, the good news is that I have a dog,and, though I don't know if I believe in luck --,I don't know what I believe in, it's a very complicated question,,but I do know that before I go away, I crank his tail seven times.,So, whenever he sees a suitcase in the house,,because everybody's always, you know, leaving,,they're always cranking this wonderful dog's tail,,and he runs to the other room.,But I am able to make the transition from working for children and --,from working for adults to children, and back and forth,,because, you know, I can say that I'm immature,,and in a way, that's true.,I don't really -- I mean, I could tell you that I didn't understand,,I'm not proud of it, but I didn't understand,let's say 95 percent of the talks at this conference.,But I have been taking beautiful notes of drawings,and I have a gorgeous onion from Murray Gell-Mann's talk.,And I have a beautiful page of doodles from Jonathan Woodham's talk.,So, good things come out of, you know, incomprehension --,(Laughter),-- which I will do a painting of, and then it will end up in my work.,So, I'm open to the possibilities of not knowing,and finding out something new. 
 So, in writing for children, it seems simple, and it is.,You have to condense a story into 32 pages, usually.,And what you have to do is, you really have to edit down to what you want to say.,And hopefully, you're not talking down to kids,and you're not talking in such a way that you,,you know, couldn't stand reading it after one time.,So, I hopefully am writing, you know,,books that are good for children and for adults.,But the painting reflects --,I don't think differently for children than I do for adults.,I try to use the same kind of imagination, the same kind of whimsy,,the same kind of love of language.,So, you know, and I have lots of wonderful-looking friends. 
 This is Andrew Gatz, and he walked in through the door and I said,,"You! Sit down there." You know, I take lots of photos.,And the Bertoia chair in the background is my favorite chair.,So, I get to put in all of the things that I love.,Hopefully, a dialog between adults and children will happen on many different levels,,and hopefully different kinds of humor will evolve.,And the books are really journals of my life.,I never -- I don't like plots.,I don't know what a plot means.,I can't stand the idea of anything that starts in the beginning,,you know, beginning, middle and end. It really scares me,,because my life is too random and too confused,,and I enjoy it that way. 
 But anyway, so we were in Venice,,and this is our room. And I had this dream,that I was wearing this fantastic green gown,,and I was looking out the window,,and it was really a beautiful thing.,And so, I was able to put that into this story, which is an alphabet,,and hopefully go on to something else.,The letter C had other things in it.,I was fortunate also, to meet the man who's sitting on the bed,,though I gave him hair over here and he doesn't have hair.,Well, he has some hair but -- well, he used to have hair.,And with him, I was able to do a project that was really fantastic.,I work for the New Yorker, and I do covers, and 9/11 happened,and it was, you know, a complete and utter end of the world as we knew it. 
 And Rick and I were on our way to a party in the Bronx,,and somebody said Bronxistan,,and somebody said Ferreristan,,and we came up with this New Yorker cover,,which we were able to -- we didn't know what we were doing.,We weren't trying to be funny, we weren't trying to be --,well, we were trying to be funny actually, that's not true.,We hoped we'd be funny, but we didn't know it would be a cover,,and we didn't know that that image, at the moment that it happened,,would be something that would be so wonderful for a lot of people.,And it really became the -- I don't know, you know,,it was one of those moments people started laughing at what was going on.,And from, you know, Fattushis, to Taxistan to, you know,,for the Fashtoonks, Botoxia, Pashmina, Khlintunisia, you know,,we were able to take the city,and make fun of this completely foreign, who are -- what's going on over here?,Who are these people? What are these tribes?,And David Remnick, who was really wonderful about it,,had one problem. He didn't like Al Zheimers,,because he thought it would insult people with Alzheimer's.,But you know, we said, "David, who's going to know?,They're not.",(Laughter),So it stayed in, and it was, and, you know, it was a good thing.,You know, in the course of my life, I never know what's going to happen,and that's kind of the beauty part. 
 And we were on Cape Cod, a place, obviously, of great inspiration,,and I picked up this book, "The Elements of Style," at a yard sale.,And I didn't -- and I'd never used it in school,,because I was too busy writing poems, and flunking out,,and I don't know what, sitting in cafes.,But I picked it up and I started reading it and I thought, this book is amazing.,I said, people should know about this book.,(Laughter),So I decided it needed a few -- it needed a lift, it needed a few illustrations.,And basically, I called the, you know, I convinced the White Estate,,and what an intersection of like, you know,,Polish Jew, you know, main WASP family. Here I am, saying,,I'd like to do something to this book.,And they said yes, and they left me completely alone,,which was a gorgeous, wonderful thing.,And I took the examples that they gave,,and just did 56 paintings, basically.,So, this is, I don't know if you can read this.,"Well, Susan, this is a fine mess you are in.",And when you're dealing with grammar,,which is, you know, incredibly dry,,E.B. White wrote such wonderful, whimsical -- and actually, Strunk --,and then you come to the rules and, you know,,there are lots of grammar things. "Do you mind me asking a question?,Do you mind my asking a question?","Would, could, should, or would, should, could.",And "would" is Coco Chanel's lover, "should" is Edith Sitwell,,and "could" is an August Sander subject.,And, "He noticed a large stain in the center of the rug.",(Laughter) 
 So, there's a kind of British understatement, murder-mystery theme,that I really love very much.,And then, "Be obscure clearly! Be wild of tongue in a way we can understand.",E.B. White wrote us a number of rules,,which can either paralyze you and make you loathe him,for the rest of time, or you can ignore them, which I do,,or you can, I don't know what, you know, eat a sandwich.,So, what I did when I was painting was I started singing,,because I really adore singing,,and I think that music is the highest form of all art.,So, I commissioned a wonderful composer, Nico Muhly,,who wrote nine songs using the text,,and we performed this fantastic evening of --,he wrote music for both amateurs and professionals.,I played the clattering teacup and the slinky,in the main reading room of the New York Public Library,,where you're supposed to be very, very quiet,,and it was a phenomenally wonderful event,,which we hopefully will do some more. 
 Who knows? The New York TimesSelect, the op-ed page,,asked me to do a column, and they said, you can do whatever you want.,So, once a month for the last year,,I've been doing a column called "The Principles of Uncertainty,",which, you know, I don't know who Heisenberg is,,but I know I can throw that around now. You know,,it's the principles of uncertainty, so, you know.,I'm going to read quickly -- and probably I'm going to edit some,,because I don't have that much time left -- a few of the columns.,And basically, I was so, you know, it was so amusing,,because I said, "Well, how much space do I have?",And they said, "Well, you know, it's the Internet.",And I said, "Yes, but how much space do I have?",And they said, "It's unlimited, it's unlimited.",OK. So, the first one I was very timid, and I'll begin.,"How can I tell you everything that is in my heart?,Impossible to begin. Enough. No. Begin with the hapless dodo.",And I talk about the dodo, and how the dodo became extinct,,and then I talk about Spinoza.,"As the last dodo was dying, Spinoza was looking for a rational explanation,for everything, called eudaemonia.,And then he breathed his last, with loved ones around him,,and I know that he had chicken soup also, as his last meal.",I happen to know it for a fact.,And then he died, and there was no more Spinoza. Extinct. 
 And then, we don't have a stuffed Spinoza,,but we do have a stuffed Pavlov's dog,,and I visited him in the Museum of Hygiene in St. Petersburg, in Russia.,And there he is, with this horrible electrical box on his rump,in this fantastic, decrepit palace.,"And I think it must have been a very, very dark day,when the Bolsheviks arrived.,Maybe amongst themselves they had a few good laughs,,but Stalin was a paranoid man, even more than my father.",(Laughter),You don't even know.,"And decided his top people had to be extinctified.",Which I think I made up, which is a good thing.,And so, this is a chart of, you know, just a small chart,,because the chart would go on forever of all the people that he killed.,So, shot dead, smacked over the head, you know, thrown away.,"Nabokov's family fled Russia. How could the young Nabokov,,sitting innocently and elegantly in a red chair,,leafing through a book and butterflies,,imagine such displacement, such loss?",And then I want to tell you that this is a map. 
 So, "My beautiful mother's family fled Russia as well.,Too many pogroms.,Leaving the shack, the wild blueberry woods, the geese, the River Sluch,,they went to Palestine and then America.",And my mother drew this map for me of the United States of America,,and that is my DNA over here, because that person who I grew up with,had no use for facts whatsoever.,Facts were actually banished from our home.,And so, if you see that Texas -- you know, Texas and California,are under Canada, and that South Carolina is on top of North Carolina,,this is the home that I grew up in, OK?,So, it's a miracle that I'm here today.,But actually, it's not. It's actually a wonderful thing.,But then she says Tel Aviv and Lenin,,which is the town they came from, and, "Sorry, the rest unknown, thank you.",But in her lexicon, "sorry, the rest unknown, thank you" is,"sorry, the rest unknown, go to hell,",because she couldn't care less.,(Laughter) 
 "The Impossibility of February",is that February's a really wretched month in New York,and the images for me conjure up these really awful things.,Well, not so awful.,I received a box in the mail and it was wrapped with newspaper,and there was the picture of the man on the newspaper and he was dead.,And I say, "I hope he's not really dead,,just enjoying a refreshing lie-down in the snow,,but the caption says he is dead.",And actually, he was. I think he's dead, though I don't know,,maybe he's not dead.,"And this woman leans over in anguish, not about that man,,but about all sad things. It happens quite often in February.",There's consoling.,This man is angry because somebody threw onions all over the staircase,,and basically -- you know, I guess onions are a theme here.,And he says, "It is impossible not to lie.,It is February and not lying is impossible.",And I really spend a lot of time wondering,,how much truth do we tell?,What is it that we're actually -- what story are we actually telling?,How do we know when we are ourselves?,How do we actually know that these sentences coming out of our mouths,are real stories, you know, are real sentences?,Or are they fake sentences that we think we ought to be saying? 
 I'm going to quickly go through this.,A quote by Bertrand Russell,,"All the labor of all the ages, all the devotion, all the inspiration,,all the noonday brightness of human genius,are destined to extinction.,So now, my friends, if that is true,,and it is true, what is the point?",A complicated question.,And so, you know, I talk to my friends,and I go to plays where they're singing Russian songs.,Oh my God, you know what?,Could we have -- no, we don't have time.,I taped my aunt. I taped my aunt singing a song in Russian from the --,you know, could we have it for a second?,Do you have that?,(Music),OK. I taped my -- my aunt used to swim in the ocean,every day of the year until she was about 85.,So -- and that's a song about how everybody's miserable,because, you know, we're from Russia.,(Laughter) 
 I went to visit Kitty Carlisle Hart, and she is 96,,and when I brought her a copy of "The Elements of Style,",she said she would treasure it.,And then I said -- oh, and she was talking about Moss Hart, and I said,,"When you met him, you knew it was him.",And she said, "I knew it was he.",(Laughter),So, I was the one who should have kept the book, but it was a really wonderful moment.,And she dated George Gershwin, so, you know, get out.,Gershwin died at the age of 38.,He's buried in the same cemetery as my husband.,I don't want to talk about that now.,I do want to talk -- the absolute icing on this cemetery cake,is the Barricini family mausoleum nearby.,I think the Barricini family should open a store there and sell chocolate.,(Laughter),And I would like to run it for them.,And I went to visit Louise Bourgeoise,,who's also still working, and I looked at her sink,,which is really amazing, and left.,And then I photograph and do a painting of a sofa on the street.,And a woman who lives on our street, Lolita.,And then I go and have some tea.,And then my Aunt Frances dies, and before she died,,she tried to pay with Sweet'N Low packets for her bagel.,(Laughter),And I wonder what the point is and then I know, and I see,that Hy Meyerowitz, Rick Meyerowitz's father,,a dry-cleaning supply salesman from the Bronx,,won the Charlie Chaplin look-alike contest in 1931.,That's actually Hy.,And I look at a beautiful bowl of fruit,,and I look at a dress that I sewed for friends of mine.,And it says, "Ich habe genug," which is a Bach cantata,,which I once thought meant "I've had it, I can't take it anymore,,give me a break," but I was wrong.,It means "I have enough." And that is utterly true.,I happen to be alive, end of discussion. Thank you.,(Applause)It's a simple idea about nature.,I want to say a word for nature,because we haven't talked that much about it the last couple days.,I want to say a word for the soil and the bees and the plants and the animals,,and tell you about a tool, a very simple tool that I have found.,Although it's really nothing more than a literary conceit; it's not a technology.,It's very powerful for, I think, changing our relationship to the natural world,and to the other species on whom we depend.,And that tool is very simply, as Chris suggested,,looking at us and the world from the plants' or the animals' point of view.,It's not my idea, other people have hit on it,,but I've tried to take it to some new places. 
 Let me tell you where I got it.,Like a lot of my ideas, like a lot of the tools I use,,I found it in the garden; I'm a very devoted gardener.,And there was a day about seven years ago: I was planting potatoes,,it was the first week of May --,this is New England, when the apple trees are just vibrating with bloom;,they're just white clouds above.,I was here, planting my chunks,,cutting up potatoes and planting it,,and the bees were working on this tree;,bumblebees, just making this thing vibrate. 
 And one of the things I really like about gardening,is that it doesn't take all your concentration,,you really can't get hurt -- it's not like woodworking --,and you have plenty of kind of mental space for speculation.,And the question I asked myself that afternoon in the garden,,working alongside that bumblebee,,was: what did I and that bumblebee have in common?,How was our role in this garden similar and different?,And I realized we actually had quite a bit in common:,both of us were disseminating the genes of one species and not another,,and both of us -- probably, if I can imagine the bee's point of view --,thought we were calling the shots.,I had decided what kind of potato I wanted to plant --,I had picked my Yukon Gold or Yellow Finn, or whatever it was --,and I had summoned those genes from a seed catalog across the country,,brought it, and I was planting it.,And that bee, no doubt, assumed that it had decided,,"I'm going for that apple tree, I'm going for that blossom,,I'm going to get the nectar and I'm going to leave." 
 We have a grammar that suggests that's who we are;,that we are sovereign subjects in nature, the bee as well as me.,I plant the potatoes, I weed the garden, I domesticate the species.,But that day, it occurred to me:,what if that grammar is nothing more than a self-serving conceit?,Because, of course, the bee thinks he's in charge or she's in charge,,but we know better.,We know that what's going on between the bee and that flower,is that bee has been cleverly manipulated by that flower.,And when I say manipulated, I'm talking about in a Darwinian sense, right?,I mean it has evolved a very specific set of traits --,color, scent, flavor, pattern -- that has lured that bee in.,And the bee has been cleverly fooled into taking the nectar,,and also picking up some powder on its leg,,and going off to the next blossom.,The bee is not calling the shots.,And I realized then, I wasn't either. 
 I had been seduced by that potato and not another,into planting its -- into spreading its genes, giving it a little bit more habitat.,And that's when I got the idea, which was, "Well, what would happen,if we kind of looked at us from this point of view of these other species who are working on us?",And agriculture suddenly appeared to me not as an invention, not as a human technology,,but as a co-evolutionary development,in which a group of very clever species, mostly edible grasses, had exploited us,,figured out how to get us to basically deforest the world.,The competition of grasses, right?,And suddenly everything looked different.,And suddenly mowing the lawn that day was a completely different experience. 
 I had thought always -- and in fact, had written this in my first book;,this was a book about gardening --,that lawns were nature under culture's boot,,that they were totalitarian landscapes,,and that when we mowed them we were cruelly suppressing the species,and never letting it set seed or die or have sex.,And that's what the lawn was.,But then I realized, "No, this is exactly what the grasses want us to do.,I'm a dupe. I'm a dupe of the lawns, whose goal in life is to outcompete the trees,,who they compete with for sunlight.",And so by getting us to mow the lawn, we keep the trees from coming back,,which in New England happens very, very quickly. 
 So I started looking at things this way,and wrote a whole book about it called "The Botany of Desire.",And I realized that in the same way you can look at a flower,and deduce all sorts of interesting things about the taste and the desires of bees --,that they like sweetness, that they like this color and not that color, that they like symmetry --,what could we find out about ourselves by doing the same thing?,That a certain kind of potato, a certain kind of drug,,a sativa-indica Cannabis cross has something to say about us.,And that, wouldn't this be kind of an interesting way to look at the world? 
 Now, the test of any idea -- I said it was a literary conceit --,is what does it get us?,And when you're talking about nature, which is really my subject as a writer,,how does it meet the Aldo Leopold test?,Which is, does it make us better citizens of the biotic community?,Get us to do things that leads to the support and perpetuation of the biota,,rather than its destruction?,And I would submit that this idea does this.,So, let me go through what you gain when you look at the world this way,,besides some entertaining insights about human desire. 
 As an intellectual matter, looking at the world from other species' points of view,helps us deal with this weird anomaly,,which is -- and this is in the realm of intellectual history --,which is that we have this Darwinian revolution 150 years ago ...,Ugh. Mini-Me. (Laughter),We have this intellectual, this Darwinian revolution in which, thanks to Darwin,,we figured out we are just one species among many;,evolution is working on us the same way it's working on all the others;,we are acted upon as well as acting;,we are really in the fiber, the fabric of life.,But the weird thing is, we have not absorbed this lesson 150 years later;,none of us really believes this.,We are still Cartesians -- the children of Descartes --,who believe that subjectivity, consciousness, sets us apart;,that the world is divided into subjects and objects;,that there is nature on one side, culture on another.,As soon as you start seeing things from the plant's point of view or the animal's point of view,,you realize that the real literary conceit is that --,is the idea that nature is opposed to culture,,the idea that consciousness is everything --,and that's another very important thing it does. 
 Looking at the world from other species' points of view,is a cure for the disease of human self-importance.,You suddenly realize that consciousness --,which we value and we consider,the crowning achievement of nature,,human consciousness -- is really just another set of tools for getting along in the world.,And it's kind of natural that we would think it was the best tool.,But, you know, there's a comedian who said,,"Well, who's telling me that consciousness is so good and so important?,Well, consciousness.",So when you look at the plants, you realize that there are other tools,and they're just as interesting. 
 I'll give you two examples, also from the garden:,lima beans. You know what a lima bean does when it's attacked by spider mites?,It releases this volatile chemical that goes out into the world,and summons another species of mite,that comes in and attacks the spider mite, defending the lima bean.,So what plants have -- while we have consciousness, tool making, language,,they have biochemistry.,And they have perfected that to a degree far beyond what we can imagine.,Their complexity, their sophistication, is something to really marvel at,,and I think it's really the scandal of the Human Genome Project.,You know, we went into it thinking, 40,000 or 50,000 human genes,and we came out with only 23,000.,Just to give you grounds for comparison, rice: 35,000 genes.,So who's the more sophisticated species?,Well, we're all equally sophisticated.,We've been evolving just as long,,just along different paths.,So, cure for self-importance, way to sort of make us feel the Darwinian idea.,And that's really what I do as a writer, as a storyteller,,is try to make people feel what we know and tell stories that actually,help us think ecologically. 
 Now, the other use of this is practical.,And I'm going to take you to a farm right now,,because I used this idea to develop my understanding of the food system,and what I learned, in fact, is that we are all, now, being manipulated by corn.,And the talk you heard about ethanol earlier today,,to me, is the final triumph of corn over good sense. (Laughter) (Applause),It is part of corn's scheme for world domination.,(Laughter),And you will see, the amount of corn planted this year will be up dramatically from last year,and there will be that much more habitat,because we've decided ethanol is going to help us. 
 So it helped me understand industrial agriculture,,which of course is a Cartesian system.,It's based on this idea that we bend other species to our will,and that we are in charge, and that we create these factories,and we have these technological inputs and we get the food out of it,or the fuel or whatever we want.,Let me take you to a very different kind of farm. 
 This is a farm in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia.,I went looking for a farm where these ideas,about looking at things from the species' point of view are actually implemented,,and I found it in a man. The farmer's name is Joel Salatin.,And I spent a week as an apprentice on his farm,,and I took away from this some of the most hopeful news about our relationship to nature,that I've ever come across in 25 years of writing about nature.,And that is this:,the farm is called Polyface, which means ...,the idea is he's got six different species of animals, as well as some plants,,growing in this very elaborate symbiotic arrangement. 
 It's permaculture, those of you who know a little bit about this,,such that the cows and the pigs and the sheep and the turkeys and the ...,what else does he have?,All the six different species -- rabbits, actually --,are all performing ecological services for one another,,such that the manure of one is the lunch for the other,and they take care of pests for one another.,It's a very elaborate and beautiful dance,,but I'm going to just give you a close-up on one piece of it,,and that is the relationship between his cattle and his chickens, his laying hens.,And I'll show you, if you take this approach, what you get, OK?,And this is a lot more than growing food, as you'll see;,this is a different way to think about nature,and a way to get away from the zero-sum notion,,the Cartesian idea that either nature's winning or we're winning,,and that for us to get what we want, nature is diminished. 
 So, one day, cattle in a pen.,The only technology involved here is this cheap electric fencing:,relatively new, hooked to a car battery;,even I could carry a quarter-acre paddock, set it up in 15 minutes.,Cows graze one day. They move, OK?,They graze everything down, intensive grazing.,He waits three days,,and then we towed in something called the Eggmobile.,The Eggmobile is a very rickety contraption --,it looks like a prairie schooner made out of boards --,but it houses 350 chickens.,He tows this into the paddock three days later and opens the gangplank,,turns them down, and 350 hens come streaming down the gangplank --,clucking, gossiping as chickens will --,and they make a beeline for the cow patties. 
 And what they're doing is very interesting:,they're digging through the cow patties,for the maggots, the grubs, the larvae of flies.,And the reason he's waited three days,is because he knows that on the fourth day or the fifth day, those larvae will hatch,and he'll have a huge fly problem.,But he waits that long to grow them as big and juicy and tasty as he can,because they are the chickens' favorite form of protein. 
 So the chickens do their kind of little breakdance,and they're pushing around the manure to get at the grubs,,and in the process they're spreading the manure out.,Very useful second ecosystem service.,And third, while they're in this paddock,they are, of course, defecating madly,and their very nitrogenous manure is fertilizing this field.,They then move out to the next one,,and in the course of just a few weeks, the grass just enters this blaze of growth.,And within four or five weeks, he can do it again.,He can graze again, he can cut, he can bring in another species,,like the lambs, or he can make hay for the winter. 
 Now, I want you to just look really close up onto what's happened there.,So, it's a very productive system.,And what I need to tell you is that on 100 acres,he gets 40,000 pounds of beef; 30,000 pounds of pork; 25,000 dozen eggs;,20,000 broilers; 1,000 turkeys; 1,000 rabbits --,an immense amount of food. 
 You know, you hear, "Can organic feed the world?",Well, look how much food you can produce on 100 acres if you do this kind of ...,again, give each species what it wants,,let it realize its desires, its physiological distinctiveness.,Put that in play. 
 But look at it from the point of view of the grass, now.,What happens to the grass when you do this?,When a ruminant grazes grass, the grass is cut from this height to this height,,and it immediately does something very interesting.,Any one of you who gardens knows that there is something called the root-shoot ratio,,and plants need to keep the root mass,in some rough balance with the leaf mass to be happy.,So when they lose a lot of leaf mass, they shed roots;,they kind of cauterize them and the roots die.,And the species in the soil go to work,basically chewing through those roots, decomposing them --,the earthworms, the fungi, the bacteria -- and the result is new soil.,This is how soil is created.,It's created from the bottom up.,This is how the prairies were built,,the relationship between bison and grasses. 
 And what I realized when I understood this --,and if you ask Joel Salatin what he is, he'll tell you he's not a chicken farmer,,he's not a sheep farmer, he's not a cattle rancher; he's a grass farmer,,because grass is really the keystone species of such a system --,is that, if you think about it, this completely contradicts the tragic idea of nature we hold in our heads,,which is that for us to get what we want, nature is diminished.,More for us, less for nature.,Here, all this food comes off this farm, and at the end of the season,there is actually more soil, more fertility and more biodiversity. 
 It's a remarkably hopeful thing to do.,There are a lot of farmers doing this today.,This is well beyond organic agriculture,,which is still a Cartesian system, more or less.,And what it tells you is that if you begin to take account of other species,,take account of the soil, that even with nothing more than this perspectival idea,-- because there is no technology involved here except for those fences,,which are so cheap they could be all over Africa in no time --,that we can take the food we need from the Earth,and actually heal the Earth in the process. 
 This is a way to reanimate the world,,and that's what's so exciting about this perspective.,When we really begin to feel Darwin's insights in our bones,,the things we can do with nothing more than these ideas,are something to be very hopeful about. 
 Thank you very much.Thank you for putting up these pictures of my colleagues over here.,(Laughter) We'll be talking about them.,Now, I'm going try an experiment. I don't do experiments, normally. I'm a theorist.,But I'm going see what happens if I press this button.,Sure enough. OK. I used to work in this field of elementary particles.,What happens to matter if you chop it up very fine?,What is it made of?,And the laws of these particles are valid throughout the universe,,and they're very much connected with the history of the universe. 
 We know a lot about four forces. There must be a lot more,,but those are at very, very small distances,,and we haven't really interacted with them very much yet.,The main thing I want to talk about is this:,that we have this remarkable experience in this field of fundamental physics,that beauty is a very successful criterion for choosing the right theory.,And why on earth could that be so? 
 Well, here's an example from my own experience.,It's fairly dramatic, actually, to have this happen.,Three or four of us, in 1957,,put forward a partially complete theory of one of these forces, this weak force.,And it was in disagreement with seven -- seven, count them, seven experiments.,Experiments were all wrong. 
 And we published before knowing that,,because we figured it was so beautiful, it's gotta be right!,The experiments had to be wrong, and they were.,Now our friend over there, Albert Einstein,,used to pay very little attention when people said,,"You know, there's a man with an experiment that seems to disagree with special relativity.,DC Miller. What about that?" And he would say, "Aw, that'll go away." (Laughter) 
 Now, why does stuff like that work? That's the question.,Now, yeah, what do we mean by beautiful? That's one thing.,I'll try to make that clear -- partially clear.,Why should it work, and is this something to do with human beings?,I'll let you in on the answer to the last one that I offer,,and that is, it has nothing to do with human beings.,Somewhere in some other planet, orbiting some very distant star,,maybe in a another galaxy,,there could well be entities that are at least as intelligent as we are,,and are interested in science. It's not impossible; I think there probably are lots. 
 Very likely, none is close enough to interact with us.,But they could be out there, very easily.,And suppose they have, you know, very different sensory apparatus, and so on.,They have seven tentacles, and they have 14 little funny-looking compound eyes,,and a brain shaped like a pretzel.,Would they really have different laws?,There are lots of people who believe that, and I think it is utter baloney.,I think there are laws out there,,and we of course don't understand them at any given time very well,-- but we try. And we try to get closer and closer. 
 And someday, we may actually figure out the fundamental unified theory,of the particles and forces, what I call the "fundamental law.",We may not even be terribly far from it.,But even if we don't run across it in our lifetimes,,we can still think there is one out there,,and we're just trying to get closer and closer to it.,I think that's the main point to be made.,We express these things mathematically.,And when the mathematics is very simple --,when in terms of some mathematical notation,,you can write the theory in a very brief space, without a lot of complication --,that's essentially what we mean by beauty or elegance. 
 Here's what I was saying about the laws. They're really there.,Newton certainly believed that.,And he said, here, "It is the business of natural philosophy to find out those laws.",The basic law, let's say -- here's an assumption.,The assumption is that the basic law really takes the form,of a unified theory of all the particles.,Now, some people call that a theory of everything.,That's wrong because the theory is quantum mechanical.,And I won't go into a lot of stuff about quantum mechanics and what it's like, and so on.,You've heard a lot of wrong things about it anyway. (Laughter),There are even movies about it with a lot of wrong stuff. 
 But the main thing here is that it predicts probabilities.,Now, sometimes those probabilities are near certainties.,And in a lot of familiar cases, they of course are.,But other times they're not, and you have only probabilities for different outcomes.,So what that means is that the history of the universe is not determined just by the fundamental law.,It's the fundamental law and this incredibly long series of accidents,,or chance outcomes, that are there in addition. 
 And the fundamental theory doesn't include those chance outcomes; they are in addition.,So it's not a theory of everything. And in fact, a huge amount of the information,in the universe around us comes from those accidents,,and not just from the fundamental laws.,Now, it's often said that getting closer and closer,to the fundamental laws by examining phenomena at low energies, and then higher energies,,and then higher energies, or short distances, and then shorter distances,,and then still shorter distances, and so on, is like peeling the skin of an onion.,And we keep doing that,,and build more powerful machines, accelerators for particles.,We look deeper and deeper into the structure of particles,,and in that way we get probably closer and closer to this fundamental law. 
 Now, what happens is that as we do that, as we peel these skins of the onion,,and we get closer and closer to the underlying law,,we see that each skin has something in common with the previous one,,and with the next one. We write them out mathematically,,and we see they use very similar mathematics.,They require very similar mathematics.,That is absolutely remarkable, and that is a central feature,of what I'm trying to say today.,Newton called it -- that's Newton, by the way -- that one. 
 This one is Albert Einstein. Hi, Al! And anyway,,he said, "nature conformable to herself" -- personifying nature as a female.,And so what happens is that the new phenomena,,the new skins, the inner skins of the slightly smaller skins of the onion,that we get to, resemble the slightly larger ones.,And the kind of mathematics that we had for the previous skin,is almost the same as what we need for the next skin.,And that's why the equations look so simple.,Because they use mathematics we already have. 
 A trivial example is this: Newton found the law of gravity,,which goes like one over the square of the distance between the things gravitated.,Coulomb, in France, found the same law for electric charges.,Here's an example of this similarity.,You look at gravity, you see a certain law.,Then you look at electricity. Sure enough. The same rule.,It's a very simple example.,There are lots of more sophisticated examples.,Symmetry is very important in this discussion.,You know what it means. A circle, for example,,is symmetric under rotations about the center of the circle.,You rotate around the center of the circle, the circle remains unchanged.,You take a sphere, in three dimensions, you rotate around the center of the sphere,,and all those rotations leave the sphere alone.,They are symmetries of the sphere.,So we say, in general, that there's a symmetry,under certain operations if those operations leave the phenomenon,,or its description, unchanged. 
 Maxwell's equations are of course symmetrical,under rotations of all of space.,Doesn't matter if we turn the whole of space around by some angle,,it doesn't leave the -- doesn't change the phenomenon of electricity or magnetism.,There's a new notation in the 19th century that expressed this,,and if you use that notation, the equations get a lot simpler.,Then Einstein, with his special theory of relativity,,looked at a whole set of symmetries of Maxwell's equations,,which are called special relativity.,And those symmetries, then, make the equations even shorter, and even prettier, therefore. 
 Let's look. You don't have to know what these things mean, doesn't make any difference.,But you can just look at the form. (Laughter) You can look at the form.,You see above, at the top, a long list,of equations with three components for the three directions of space: x, y and z.,Then, using vector analysis, you use rotational symmetry, and you get this next set.,Then you use the symmetry of special relativity and you get an even simpler set,down here, showing that symmetry exhibits better and better.,The more and more symmetry you have, the better you exhibit the simplicity and elegance of the theory. 
 The last two, the first equation says that electric charges and currents,give rise to all the electric and magnetic fields.,The next -- second -- equation says that there is no magnetism other than that.,The only magnetism comes from electric charges and currents.,Someday we may find some slight hole in that argument.,But for the moment, that's the case. 
 Now, here is a very exciting development that many people have not heard of.,They should have heard of it, but it's a little tricky to explain in technical detail,,so I won't do it. I'll just mention it. (Laughter),But Chen Ning Yang, called by us "Frank" Yang -- (Laughter),-- and Bob Mills put forward, 50 years ago,,this generalization of Maxwell's equations, with a new symmetry.,A whole new symmetry.,Mathematics very similar, but there was a whole new symmetry.,They hoped that this would contribute somehow to particle physics,-- didn't. It didn't, by itself, contribute to particle physics. 
 But then some of us generalized it further. And then it did!,And it gave a very beautiful description of the strong force and of the weak force.,So here we say, again, what we said before:,that each skin of the onion shows a similarity to the adjoining skins.,So the mathematics for the adjoining skins is very similar to what we need for the new one.,And therefore it looks beautiful,because we already know how to write it in a lovely, concise way. 
 So here are the themes. We believe there is a unified theory underlying all the regularities.,Steps toward unification exhibit the simplicity.,Symmetry exhibits the simplicity.,And then there is self-similarity across the scales -- in other words,,from one skin of the onion to another one.,Proximate self-similarity. And that accounts for this phenomenon.,That will account for why beauty is a successful criterion for selecting the right theory. 
 Here's what Newton himself said:,"Nature is very consonant and conformable to her self.",One thing he was thinking of is something that most of us take for granted today,,but in his day it wasn't taken for granted.,There's the story, which is not absolutely certain to be right, but a lot of people told it.,Four sources told it. That when they had the plague in Cambridge,,and he went down to his mother's farm -- because the university was closed --,he saw an apple fall from a tree, or on his head or something.,And he realized suddenly that the force that drew the apple down to the earth,could be the same as the force regulating the motions of the planets and the moon. 
 That was a big unification for those days, although today we take it for granted.,It's the same theory of gravity.,So he said that this principle of nature, consonance:,"This principle of nature being very remote from the conceptions of philosophers,,I forbore to describe it in that book,,lest I should be accounted an extravagant freak ... ",That's what we all have to watch out for, (Laughter) especially at this meeting.," ... and so prejudice my readers against all those things which were the main design of the book." 
 Now, who today would claim that as a mere conceit of the human mind?,That the force that causes the apple to fall to the ground,is the same force that causes the planets and the moon to move around,,and so on? Everybody knows that. It's a property of gravitation.,It's not something in the human mind. The human mind can, of course, appreciate it,and enjoy it, use it, but it's not -- it doesn't stem from the human mind.,It stems from the character of gravity.,And that's true of all the things we're talking about.,They are properties of the fundamental law.,The fundamental law is such that the different skins of the onion resemble one another,,and therefore the math for one skin allows you to express beautifully and simply,the phenomenon of the next skin. 
 I say here that Newton did a lot of things that year:,gravity, the laws of motion, the calculus, white light composed of all the colors of the rainbow.,And he could have written quite an essay on "What I Did Over My Summer Vacation.",(Laughter),So we don't have to assume these principles as separate metaphysical postulates.,They follow from the fundamental theory.,They are what we call emergent properties.,You don't need -- you don't need something more to get something more.,That's what emergence means. 
 Life can emerge from physics and chemistry, plus a lot of accidents.,The human mind can arise from neurobiology and a lot of accidents,,the way the chemical bond arises from physics and certain accidents.,It doesn't diminish the importance of these subjects,to know that they follow from more fundamental things, plus accidents.,That's a general rule, and it's critically important to realize that.,You don't need something more in order to get something more.,People keep asking that when they read my book, "The Quark and the Jaguar,",and they say, "Isn't there something more beyond what you have there?",Presumably, they mean something supernatural.,Anyway, there isn't. (Laughter),You don't need something more to explain something more.,Thank you very much. (Applause)Well, I'm involved in other things, besides physics.,In fact, mostly now in other things. 
 One thing is distant relationships among human languages.,And the professional, historical linguists in the U.S.,and in Western Europe mostly try to stay away,from any long-distance relationships, big groupings,,groupings that go back a long time,,longer than the familiar families.,They don't like that. They think it's crank. I don't think it's crank.,And there are some brilliant linguists, mostly Russians,,who are working on that, at Santa Fe Institute and in Moscow,,and I would love to see where that leads. 
 Does it really lead to a single ancestor,some 20, 25,000 years ago?,And what if we go back beyond that single ancestor,,when there was presumably a competition among many languages?,How far back does that go? How far back does modern language go?,How many tens of thousands of years does it go back? 
 Chris Anderson: Do you have a hunch or a hope for what the answer to that is? 
 Murray Gell-Mann: Well, I would guess that modern language must be older,than the cave paintings and cave engravings and cave sculptures,and dance steps in the soft clay in the caves in Western Europe,,in the Aurignacian Period some 35,000 years ago, or earlier.,I can't believe they did all those things and didn't also have a modern language.,So, I would guess that the actual origin goes back at least that far and maybe further. 
 But that doesn't mean that all, or many, or most,of today's attested languages couldn't descend perhaps,from one that's much younger than that, like say 20,000 years,,or something of that kind. It's what we call a bottleneck. 
 CA: Well, Philip Anderson may have been right.,You may just know more about everything than anyone.,So, it's been an honor. Thank you Murray Gell-Mann.,(Applause)So, I'm in Chile,,in the Atacama desert, sitting in a hotel lobby,,because that's the only place that I can get a Wi-Fi connection,,and I have this picture up on my screen,,and a woman comes up behind me.,She says, "Oh, that's beautiful.,What is it? Is that Jackson Pollock?",And unfortunately, I can be a little too honest.,I said, "No, it's -- it's penguin shit." 
 (Laughter) 
 And, you know, "Excuse me!",And I could sense,that she thought I was speaking synecdochically. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, I said, "No, no, really -- it's penguin shit." 
 (Laughter) 
 Because I had just been in the Falkland Islands,taking pictures of penguins.,This is a Gentoo penguin. And she was still skeptical.,So, literally, a few minutes before that,,I downloaded this scientific paper,about calculations on avian defecation,,which is really quite interesting, because it turns out,you can model this as something called "Poiseuille flow,",and you can learn an awful lot,about the physics of the avian rectum.,Actually, technically, it's not a rectum. It's called a cloaca. 
 At this point, she stops me,,and she says, "Who are you?,Wha -- what do you do?",And I was stuck,,because I didn't have any way to describe what I do.,And so, in some sense,,this talk today,is my answer to that.,It's a selection of a random bunch of the stuff that I do.,And it's very hard for me to make sense of it,,so I'm not sure that you can.,It's the kind of thing that I sit up late at night thinking about sometimes --,often at four in the morning. 
 So, some people are afraid of what I do.,Some people think I am the nerd Tony Soprano,,and in response, I have ordered,a bulletproof pocket protector.,I'm not sure what these people think,,because I don't speak Norsk. 
 (Laughter) 
 But I'm not thinking "monsteret" is a good thing.,I don't know, you know?,So, one of the things that I love to do,is travel around the world and look at archaeological sites.,Because archaeology gives us an opportunity,to study past civilizations,,and see where they succeeded,and where they failed.,Use science to, you know,,work backwards and say, "Well, really, what were they thinking?" 
 And recently, I was in Easter Island,,which is an incredibly beautiful place,,and an incredibly mysterious place,,because no matter where you go in Easter Island,,you're struck by these statues, called the moai.,The place is 64 square miles.,They made, so far as we can tell, 900 of them.,Why on Earth? And if you haven't read,Jared Diamond's book, "Collapse,",I totally recommend that you do.,He's got a great chapter about it.,Basically, these people,committed ecological suicide,in order to make more of these.,And somewhere along the line, somebody said,,"I know! Let's cut down the last tree,and commit suicide, because,we need more identical statues." 
 (Laughter) 
 And,,one thing that isn't a mystery, actually,,was when I grew up -- because when I was a little kid, I'd seen these pictures --,and I thought, "Well, why that look on the face?,Why that brow?" I mean, it's such a powerful thing.,Where did they get that inspiration?,And then I met Yoyo,,who is the native Rapa Nui-an guide,,and if you look at Yoyo's face,,you kind of figure out where they got it. 
 There's many mysteries, these statues.,Everyone wants to know, how did they make them,,how did they transport them?,This woman in the foreground is Jo Anne Van Tilberg.,She's the leading archaeologist working Easter Island today.,And she has studied the statues for 20-some years,,and she has detailed records of every single statue.,The one on the page here is the same that's up there.,One interesting problem is the stone isn't very hard.,So, this used to be completely smooth.,In fact, in many of the statues, when you excavate them,,the backs are totally smooth -- almost glass smooth.,But after 1,000 years out in the weather,,they look like this. 
 Jo Anne and I have just embarked on a project to digitize them all,,and we're going to do a very high-res digitization,,first because it's a way of preserving them.,Second, we have these ideas about how you can algorithmically, then,,learn a few of the mysteries about them.,How long have they been standing in what positions?,And maybe, indirectly, get at some of the issues of,what caused them to be the way they are.,While I was in Easter Island, comet McNaught was there also,,so you get a gratuitous picture,of a moai with a comet. 
 I also have an archaeological project going on,in Egypt.,"Going on" is perhaps a little bit strong.,We're trying to get all of the permissions,to get everything all set, to get it going.,So, I'll talk about it at a future TED.,But there's some amazing opportunities in Egypt as well.,Another thing I do is I invent stuff.,In fact, I design nuclear reactors.,Not a joke.,This is the conventional,nuclear fuel cycle.,The red line is what is done in,most nuclear reactors. It's called the open fuel cycle.,The white lines are what's called an advance fuel cycle,,where you reprocess. 
 Now, this is the normal way it's done.,It's got the huge advantage that it,does not create carbon pollution.,It has a lot of disadvantages:,each one of these steps is extremely expensive,,it's potentially dangerous,and they have the interesting property that the step,cannot be performed in anyone's backyard,,which is a problem.,So, our reactor eliminates these steps,,which, if we can actually make it work, is a really cool thing.,Now, it's kind of nuts to work on a new nuclear reactor.,There's -- no reactor's been even built,to an old design, much less a new one, in the United States,for 25 years.,It's the kind of very high-risk, but potentially very high-return,thing that we do. 
 Changing into a totally different field,,we do a lot of stuff in solid state physics,,particularly in an area called metamaterials.,A metamaterial is an artificial material,,which manipulates, in this case, electromagnetic radiation,,in a way that you couldn't otherwise.,So, this device here is an invisibility cloak.,It may not seem that, but if you were a microwave,,this is how you would view it.,Rays of light -- in this case, microwave light --,come in, and they just squish around the cell,,and they come back the other side.,Now, you could do that with mirrors from one angle.,The cool thing is, this does it from all angles.,Metamaterials, unfortunately --,A, it only works on microwave,,and B, it doesn't work all that well yet.,But metamaterials are an incredibly exciting field.,It's -- you know, today I'd like to say,it's a zero billion dollar business, but,,in fact, it's negative.,But some day, some day, maybe it's going to work. 
 We do a lot of work in biomedical fields.,In this case, we're working with a major medical foundation,to develop inexpensive ways of diagnosing,diseases in developing countries.,So, they say the eyes are the windows of the soul --,turns out they're a window to a whole lot more stuff.,And these happen to be my eyes, by the way. 
 Now, I'm also very interested in cooking.,While I was at Microsoft, I took a leave of absence,and went to a chef school in France.,I used to work, also while at Microsoft,,at a leading restaurant in Seattle,,so I do a lot of cooking.,I've been on a team that won,the world championship of barbecue.,But barbecue's interesting, because it's one of these cult foods,like chili, or bouillabaisse.,Various parts of the world will have a cult food,that people get enormously attached to --,there's tremendous traditions, there's secrecy.,And I'm trying to use a very,scientific approach.,So, this is my latest cooker,,and if this looks more complicated than the nuclear reactor,,that's because it is.,But if you get to play with all those knobs and dials --,and of course, really the controller over there does it all on software --,you can make some terrific ribs. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is a high-speed centrifuge.,You should all have one in your kitchen,,beside your Turbochef.,This subjects food to a force about 50,000 times,that of normal gravity,,and oh boy, does it clarify chicken stock.,You would not believe it!,I perform a series of ghoulish experiments,on food --,in this case, trying to calibrate a mathematical model,so that one can predict exactly,what the internal cooking times are.,It turns out, A, it's useful, and for a geek like me, it's fun.,Theory is red,,black is experiment.,So, I'm either really good at faking it,,or this particular model seems to work. 
 So, another random thing I do,is the search for extraterrestrial intelligence,,or SETI.,And you may be familiar with the movie "Contact,",which sort of popularized that.,It turns out there are real people who go out,and search for extraterrestrials in a very scientific way.,In fact, almost everybody in the movie,is based on a real character, a real person.,So, the Jodie Foster character here,is actually this woman, Jill Tarter,,and Jill has dedicated her life to this.,You know, a lot of people risk their lives,in a brief act of heroism,,which is kind of cool,,but Jill has,what I call slow heroism.,She is risking her professional life on something,that her own calculations show,may not work for a thousand years -- may not ever.,So, I like to support people that are risking their lives. 
 After the movie came out, of course, there was a lot of interest in SETI.,My kids saw the movie,,and afterwards they came to me and they said,,"So, Dad, so -- so --,that character -- that's Jill, right?",I said, "Oh, yeah, yeah -- absolutely.","And that other person, that's someone -- " I said, "Yes.",They said, "Well, you know that creepy rich guy in the movie?,Is that you?",I said, "Well, you know, it's just a movie! Come on." 
 (Laughter) 
 So, the SETI Institute,,with a little bit of help from me, and a lot of help from Paul Allen,and a variety of other people,,is building a dedicated radio telescope,in Hat Creek, California,,so they can do this SETI work.,Now, I travel a lot, and I change cell phones a lot,,and the one person who always gets updated,on all my cell phones and pagers and everything else,is Jill, because I really don't want to miss,"the call." 
 (Laughter) 
 I mean, can you imagine? E.T.'s phoning home,,and I'm not, like, there? You know, horrible!,So, I do a lot of work on dinosaurs.,I'm known to TEDsters as the guy that has sex with dinosaurs.,And I resemble that remark.,I'm going to talk about a different aspect of dinosaurs,,which is the finding of them.,Now, to find dinosaurs, you hike around in horrible conditions,looking for a dinosaur.,It sounds really dumb, but that's what it is.,It's horrible conditions, because,wherever you have nice weather,,plants grow,,and you don't get any erosion, and you don't see any dinosaurs.,So, you always find dinosaurs,in deserts or badlands,,areas that have very little plant growth,and have flash floods in the spring.,You know, skiers pray for snow?,Paleontologists pray for erosion. 
 So, you hike around,and -- this is after you dig them up, they look like this.,You hike around, you see something like this.,Now, this is something I found, so look at it very closely here.,You've got this bentonite clay,,which is -- sort of swells up and expands.,And there's some stuff poking out. So, you look at that,,and you look up close, and you say,,"Well, gee, that's kind of interesting. What are all of these pieces?",Well, if you look closely, you can recognize, actually,,from the shape, that these are skull fragments.,And then when you look at this,,you say, "That's a tooth.,It's a big tooth.",It's about the size of a banana.,It has a big serration on the edge.,This is what Tyrannosaurus rex looks like in the ground.,And this is what it's like to find a Tyrannosaurus rex,,which I was lucky enough to do a few years ago. 
 Now, this is what Tyrannosaurus rex looks like in my living room.,Not the same one, actually. This is a cast, which I had bought,,and then, after buying the cast, I found my own,,and I don't have room for two.,You know.,So, the thing that's wonderful for me about finding dinosaurs,is that it is both an intellectual thing,,because you're trying to reconstruct the environment,of millions of years ago.,It's something that can inform all sorts of science,in unexpected ways.,The study of dinosaurs led to the realization,that there's a problem with asteroid impact,,for example.,The study of dinosaurs may, literally,,one day save the planet. 
 Study of the ancient climate is very important.,In fact, the Mesozoic, when dinosaurs lived,,had much higher CO2 than today,,was much warmer than today, and is one of the interesting proof points,for the effects of CO2 on climate.,But, besides being intellectually,and scientifically interesting, it's also very different,than the other things I do, because you get to hike around in the badlands.,This is actually what most dinosaur research looks like.,This is one of my papers: "A pygostyle from a non-avian theropod.",It's not as gripping as dinosaur sex,,so we're not going to go into it further. 
 Now, I'm also really big on photography.,I travel all over the world taking pictures --,some of them good, most of them not.,These days, bits are cheap. Unfortunately, that means,you've got to spend more time sorting through them.,Here's a picture I took in the Falkland Islands,of king penguins on a beach.,Here's a picture I took in Alaska, a few years ago, of Orcas.,I'd gone up to photograph Orcas,,and we had looked for a week,,and we hadn't seen a damn Orca.,And the last day, the sun comes out,,the Orcas come, they're right by the boat. It's fantastic.,And I get lots of pictures like this.,Then, a little bit later,,I start getting some pictures like this.,Now, to a human audience, I need to explain that,if Penthouse magazine had a marine mammal edition,,this would be the centerfold.,It's true.,So, there's more and more activity near the boat,,and all of a sudden somebody shouts,,"What's that in the water?",I said, "Well, I think that's what you call a free willy." 
 (Laughter) 
 There's a variety of things you can learn from watching whales have sex. 
 (Laughter),The first thing you learn,is the overwhelming importance of hands.,They don't have them. 
 (Laughter) 
 I think Paul Simon is in the audience,,and he has --,he may not realize it, but he wrote a song all about whale sex,,"Slip-Slidin' Away.",That's kind of what it's like.,The other interesting thing that I learned about whale sex:,they curl their toes too. 
 (Laughter) 
 So --,where do you go putting all of these disparate pieces together?,You know, there's a tremendous amount of wisdom,in finding a great thing, passion in life,,and focusing all your energy on it,,and I've never been able to do that.,I just -- you know, because, yes,,I'll focus passion on something,,but then there will be something else, and then there's something else again.,And for a long time I fought this, and I thought,,"Well, gee, I really ought to buckle down.",And you know, when I was at Microsoft,,that was so engrossing,,and the whole industry was expanding so much,,that it did tend to crowd out most of the other things in my life. 
 But ultimately,,I decided,that what I really ought to do is not fight being who I am,,but embrace it.,And say, "Yeah, you know, I --,this whole talk has been a mile wide and an inch deep,,but that's really what works for me.",And regardless of whether it's nuclear reactors,or metamaterials or whale sex,,the common -- or lowest common denominator -- is me.,That's it, thank you. 
 (Applause)Thank you very much, Chris. Everybody who came up here,said they were scared. I don't know if I'm scared,,but this is my first time of addressing an audience like this.,And I don't have any smart technology for you to look at.,There are no slides, so you'll just have to be content with me.,(Laughter) 
 What I want to do this morning is share with you a couple of stories,and talk about a different Africa.,Already this morning there were some allusions to the Africa,that you hear about all the time: the Africa of HIV/AIDS,,the Africa of malaria, the Africa of poverty, the Africa of conflict,,and the Africa of disasters. 
 While it is true that those things are going on,,there's an Africa that you don't hear about very much.,And sometimes I'm puzzled, and I ask myself why.,This is the Africa that is changing, that Chris alluded to.,This is the Africa of opportunity.,This is the Africa where people want to take charge of,their own futures and their own destinies.,And this is the Africa where people are looking for partnerships,to do this. That's what I want to talk about today. 
 And I want to start by telling you,a story about that change in Africa.,On 15th of September 2005, Mr. Diepreye Alamieyeseigha,,a governor of one of the oil-rich states of Nigeria,,was arrested by the London Metropolitan Police on a visit to London.,He was arrested because there were transfers of eight million dollars,that went into some dormant accounts,that belonged to him and his family.,This arrest occurred because there was cooperation,between the London Metropolitan Police,and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission of Nigeria --,led by one of our most able and courageous people: Mr. Nuhu Ribadu.,Alamieyeseigha was arraigned in London.,Due to some slip-ups, he managed to escape dressed as a woman,and ran from London back to Nigeria where,,according to our constitution, those in office,as governors, president -- as in many countries --,have immunity and cannot be prosecuted. But what happened:,people were so outraged by this behavior that it was possible,for his state legislature to impeach him and get him out of office. 
 Today, Alams -- as we call him for short -- is in jail.,This is a story about the fact that people in Africa,are no longer willing to tolerate corruption from their leaders.,This is a story about the fact that people want their resources,managed properly for their good, and not taken out to places,where they'll benefit just a few of the elite.,And therefore, when you hear about the corrupt Africa --,corruption all the time -- I want you to know that the people,and the governments are trying hard to fight this,in some of the countries, and that some successes are emerging. 
 Does it mean the problem is over? The answer is no.,There's still a long way to go, but that there's a will there.,And that successes are being chalked up on this very important fight.,So when you hear about corruption,,don't just feel that nothing is being done about this --,that you can't operate in any African country,because of the overwhelming corruption. That is not the case.,There's a will to fight, and in many countries, that fight is ongoing,and is being won. In others, like mine,,where there has been a long history of dictatorship in Nigeria,,the fight is ongoing and we have a long way to go. 
 But the truth of the matter is that this is going on.,The results are showing:,independent monitoring by the World Bank and other organizations,show that in many instances the trend is downwards,in terms of corruption, and governance is improving.,A study by the Economic Commission for Africa showed,a clear trend upwards in governance in 28 African countries. 
 And let me say just one more thing,before I leave this area of governance.,That is that people talk about corruption, corruption.,All the time when they talk about it,you immediately think about Africa.,That's the image: African countries. But let me say this:,if Alams was able to export eight million dollars into an account in London --,if the other people who had taken money, estimated at,20 to 40 billion now of developing countries' monies,sitting abroad in the developed countries -- if they're able to do this,,what is that? Is that not corruption?,In this country, if you receive stolen goods, are you not prosecuted?,So when we talk about this kind of corruption, let us also think,about what is happening on the other side of the globe --,where the money's going and what can be done to stop it.,I'm working on an initiative now, along with the World Bank,,on asset recovery, trying to do what we can,to get the monies that have been taken abroad --,developing countries' moneys -- to get that sent back.,Because if we can get the 20 billion dollars sitting out there back,,it may be far more for some of these countries,than all the aid that is being put together.,(Applause) 
 The second thing I want to talk about is the will for reform.,Africans, after -- they're tired, we're tired,of being the subject of everybody's charity and care.,We are grateful, but we know that,we can take charge of our own destinies if we have the will to reform.,And what is happening in many African countries now is a realization,that no one can do it but us. We have to do it.,We can invite partners who can support us, but we have to start.,We have to reform our economies, change our leadership,,become more democratic, be more open to change and to information. 
 And this is what we started to do,in one of the largest countries on the continent, Nigeria.,In fact, if you're not in Nigeria, you're not in Africa.,I want to tell you that.,(Laughter),One in four sub-Saharan Africans is Nigerian,,and it has 140 million dynamic people -- chaotic people --,but very interesting people. You'll never be bored.,(Laughter) 
 What we started to do was to realize,that we had to take charge and reform ourselves.,And with the support of a leader,who was willing, at the time, to do the reforms,,we put forward a comprehensive reform program,,which we developed ourselves.,Not the International Monetary Fund. Not the World Bank,,where I worked for 21 years and rose to be a vice president.,No one can do it for you. You have to do it for yourself. 
 We put together a program that would, one: get the state,out of businesses it had nothing -- it had no business being in.,The state should not be in the business,of producing goods and services,because it's inefficient and incompetent.,So we decided to privatize many of our enterprises.,(Applause),We -- as a result, we decided to liberalize many of our markets.,Can you believe that prior to this reform --,which started at the end of 2003, when I left Washington,to go and take up the post of Finance Minister --,we had a telecommunications company that was only able to develop,4,500 landlines in its entire 30-year history?,(Laughter) 
 Having a telephone in my country was a huge luxury.,You couldn't get it. You had to bribe.,You had to do everything to get your phone.,When President Obasanjo supported and launched,the liberalization of the telecommunications sector,,we went from 4,500 landlines to 32 million GSM lines, and counting.,Nigeria's telecoms market is the second-fastest growing in the world,,after China. We are getting investments of about a billion dollars a year,in telecoms. And nobody knows, except a few smart people.,(Laughter) 
 The smartest one, first to come in,,was the MTN company of South Africa.,And in the three years that I was Finance Minister,,they made an average of 360 million dollars profit per year.,360 million in a market -- in a country that is a poor country,,with an average per capita income just under 500 dollars per capita.,So the market is there.,When they kept this under wraps, but soon others got to know.,Nigerians themselves began to develop,some wireless telecommunications companies,,and three or four others have come in.,But there's a huge market out there,,and people don't know about it, or they don't want to know.,So privatization is one of the things we've done. 
 The other thing we've also done is to manage our finances better.,Because nobody's going to help you and support you,if you're not managing your own finances well.,And Nigeria, with the oil sector, had the reputation,of being corrupt and not managing its own public finances well.,So what did we try to do? We introduced a fiscal rule,that de-linked our budget from the oil price.,Before we used to just budget on whatever oil we bring in,,because oil is the biggest, most revenue-earning sector,in the economy: 70 percent of our revenues come from oil.,We de-linked that, and once we did it, we began to budget,at a price slightly lower than the oil price,and save whatever was above that price.,We didn't know we could pull it off; it was very controversial.,But what it immediately did was that the volatility,that had been present in terms of our economic development --,where, even if oil prices were high, we would grow very fast.,When they crashed, we crashed.,And we could hardly even pay anything, any salaries, in the economy.,That smoothened out. We were able to save, just before I left,,27 billion dollars. Whereas -- and this went to our reserves --,when I arrived in 2003, we had seven billion dollars in reserves.,By the time I left, we had gone up to almost 30 billion dollars. And,as we speak now, we have about 40 billion dollars in reserves,due to proper management of our finances.,And that shores up our economy, makes it stable. 
 Our exchange rate that used to fluctuate all the time,is now fairly stable and being managed so that business people,have a predictability of prices in the economy.,We brought inflation down from 28 percent to about 11 percent.,And we had GDP grow from an average of 2.3 percent the previous decade,to about 6.5 percent now.,So all the changes and reforms we were able to make,have shown up in results that are measurable in the economy. 
 And what is more important, because we want to get away from oil,and diversify -- and there are so many opportunities,in this one big country, as in many countries in Africa --,what was remarkable is that much of this growth came,not from the oil sector alone, but from non-oil.,Agriculture grew at better than eight percent.,As telecoms sector grew, housing and construction,,and I could go on and on. And this is to illustrate to you that,once you get the macro-economy straightened out,,the opportunities in various other sectors are enormous. 
 We have opportunities in agriculture, like I said.,We have opportunities in solid minerals. We have a lot of minerals,that no one has even invested in or explored. And we realized,that without the proper legislation to make that possible,,that wouldn't happen. So we've now got a mining code,that is comparable with some of the best in the world.,We have opportunities in housing and real estate.,There was nothing in a country of 140 million people --,no shopping malls as you know them here.,This was an investment opportunity for someone,that excited the imagination of people.,And now, we have a situation in which the businesses in this mall,are doing four times the turnover that they had projected. 
 So, huge things in construction, real estate,,mortgage markets. Financial services:,we had 89 banks. Too many not doing their real business.,We consolidated them from 89 to 25 banks by requiring,that they increase their capital -- share capital.,And it went from about 25 million dollars to 150 million dollars.,The banks -- these banks are now consolidated, and that strengthening,of the banking system has attracted a lot of investment from outside.,Barclays Bank of the U.K. is bringing in 500 million.,Standard Chartered has brought in 140 million.,And I can go on. Dollars, on and on, into the system. 
 We are doing the same with the insurance sector.,So in financial services, a great deal of opportunity.,In tourism, in many African countries, a great opportunity.,And that's what many people know East Africa for:,the wildlife, the elephants, and so on.,But managing the tourism market in a way,that can really benefit the people is very important. 
 So what am I trying to say? I'm trying to tell you,that there's a new wave on the continent.,A new wave of openness and democratization in which, since 2000,,more than two-thirds of African countries have had,multi-party democratic elections.,Not all of them have been perfect, or will be,,but the trend is very clear.,I'm trying to tell you that since the past three years,,the average rate of growth on the continent has moved,from about 2.5 percent to about five percent per annum.,This is better than the performance of many OECD countries.,So it's clear that things are changing. 
 Conflicts are down on the continent;,from about 12 conflicts a decade ago,,we are down to three or four conflicts --,one of the most terrible, of course, of which is Darfur.,And, you know, you have the neighborhood effect where,if something is going on in one part of the continent,,it looks like the entire continent is affected.,But you should know that this continent is not --,is a continent of many countries, not one country.,And if we are down to three or four conflicts,,it means that there are plenty of opportunities to invest,in stable, growing, exciting economies,where there's plenty of opportunity.,And I want to just make one point about this investment. 
 The best way to help Africans today,is to help them to stand on their own feet.,And the best way to do that is by helping create jobs.,There's no issue with fighting malaria and putting money in that,and saving children's lives. That's not what I'm saying. That is fine.,But imagine the impact on a family: if the parents can be employed,and make sure that their children go to school,,that they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselves.,If we can invest in places where you yourselves make money,whilst creating jobs and helping people stand on their own feet,,isn't that a wonderful opportunity? Isn't that the way to go?,And I want to say that some of the best people to invest in,on the continent are the women.,(Applause) 
 I have a CD here. I'm sorry that I didn't say anything on time.,Otherwise, I would have liked you to have seen this.,It says, "Africa: Open for Business.",And this is a video that has actually won an award,as the best documentary of the year.,Understand that the woman who made it,is going to be in Tanzania, where they're having the session in June.,But it shows you Africans, and particularly African women, who,against all odds have developed businesses, some of them world-class. 
 One of the women in this video, Adenike Ogunlesi,,making children's clothes --,which she started as a hobby and grew into a business.,Mixing African materials, such as we have,,with materials from elsewhere.,So, she'll make a little pair of dungarees with corduroys,,with African material mixed in. Very creative designs,,has reached a stage where she even had an order from Wal-Mart.,(Laughter),For 10,000 pieces.,So that shows you that we have people who are capable of doing. 
 And the women are diligent. They are focused; they work hard.,I could go on giving examples:,Beatrice Gakuba of Rwanda, who opened up a flower business,and is now exporting to the Dutch auction in Amsterdam each morning,and is employing 200 other women and men to work with her.,However, many of these are starved for capital to expand,,because nobody believes outside of our countries,that we can do what is necessary. Nobody thinks in terms of a market.,Nobody thinks there's opportunity.,But I'm standing here saying that those who miss the boat now,,will miss it forever. 
 So if you want to be in Africa, think about investing.,Think about the Beatrices, think about the Adenikes of this world,,who are doing incredible things, that are bringing them,into the global economy, whilst at the same time making sure,that their fellow men and women are employed,,and that the children in those households get educated,because their parents are earning adequate income. 
 So I invite you to explore the opportunities.,When you go to Tanzania, listen carefully,,because I'm sure you will hear of the various openings that there will be,for you to get involved in something that will do good,for the continent, for the people and for yourselves. 
 Thank you very much.,(Applause)In 1962, Buckminster Fuller,presented the particularly audacious proposal for the Geoscope.,It was a 200-foot diameter geodesic sphere,to be suspended over the East River in New York City, in full view of the United Nations.,It was a big idea, for sure, and it was one that he felt could truly inform,and deeply affect the decision making of this body,through animations of global data, trends,and other information regarding the globe, on this sphere.,And today, 45 years later,,we clearly have no less need for this kind of clarity and perspective,,but what we do have is improved technology. 
 Today we don't need one million light bulbs to create a spherical display.,We can use LEDs.,LEDs are smaller, they're cheaper, they're longer lasting, they're more efficient.,Most importantly for this, they're faster.,And this speed, combined with today's high-performance micro-controllers,,allows us to actually simulate, in this piece,,over 17,000 LEDs -- using just 64.,And the way this happens is through the phenomenon of persistence of vision.,But as this ring rotates at about 1,700 rpm -- that's 28 times per second.,The equator's speed is actually about 60 miles per hour.,There are four on-board micro-controllers,that, each time this ring rotates,it, as it passes the rear of the display,,it picks up a position signal.,And from that, the on-board micro-controllers,can extrapolate the position of the ring at all points around the revolution,and display arbitrary bitmap images and animations. 
 But this is really just the beginning.,In addition to higher resolution versions of this display,,my father and I are working on a new patent-pending design,for a fully volumetric display using the same phenomenon.,It achieves this by rotating LEDs about two axes.,So as you can see here, this is a, eleven-inch diameter circuit board.,These blocks represent LEDs.,And so you could see that as this disc rotates about this axis,,it will create a disc of light that we can control.,That's nothing new: that's a propeller clock;,that's the rims that you can buy for your car.,But what is new is that, when we rotate this disc about this axis,,this disc of light actually becomes a sphere of light.,And so we can control that with micro-controllers,and create a fully volumetric, three-dimensional display with just 256 LEDs. 
 Now this piece is currently in process --,due out in May -- but what we've done is we've put together a small demo,,just to show the geometric translation of points into a sphere.,I've got a little video to show you,,but keep in mind that this is with no electronic control,,and this is also with only four LEDs.,This is actually only about 1.5 percent of what the final display will be in May.,So, take a look.,And here you can see it's rotating about the vertical axis only, creating circles.,And then, as the other axis kicks in,,those actually blur into a volume.,And the shutter speed of the camera,actually makes it slightly less effective in this case. 
 But this piece is due out in May.,It'll be on display at the Interactive Telecommunications Spring Show,in Greenwich Village in New York City -- that's open to the public,,definitely invite you all to come and attend -- it's a fantastic show.,There are hundreds of student innovators with fantastic projects.,This piece, actually, will be on display,down in the Sierra Simulcast Lounge,in the breaks between now and the end of the show.,So I'd love to talk to you all, and invite you,to come down and take a closer look.,It's an honor to be here. Thanks very much. 
 (Applause)Those of us who believe in heaven have some sort of idea of what heaven would be.,And in my idea, heaven is satisfied curiosity.,I think of heaven as a really comfortable cloud,where I can just lie down with my belly down,,like I was watching TV when I was a child, and my elbows up.,And I can basically look everywhere I want,,see every movie I've always wanted to see.,And in the same kind of trance that you can feel sometimes,in the subway in New York when you're reading,,there's something really soothing and easy. 
 Well, the funny thing is that I already have that kind of life, in a way,,because I discovered ...,it took me a while to understand it,,but when I discovered around 24 years of age that I was much more comfortable,with objects than with people, I finally decided to really embrace this passion.,And I basically live my life in sort of a trance,,and I look around and everything I see is just the beginning of a long story. 
 Just to give you an example:,this is the exhibition, Humble Masterpieces, as it was at MoMA in 2004.,We were in Queens,,we were building the big, big, big, big building in Midtown,,so we were in the small, small, small boondocks.,That was one of the funnest moments of my career. 
 But it's not only that.,The typeface -- the typeface is Helvetica;,it's its 50th anniversary this year.,And so I start thinking -- Max Miedinger and all those Swiss designers together,,trying to outdo Akzidenz-Grotesk, and come up with a new sans-serif typeface --,and the movie starts playing in my head already.,And of course, you can imagine, with Humble Masterpieces,it was the same thing multiplied by a hundred.,And I do hope, by the way, that the real goal of the exhibition,is going to have the same effect on you. 
 The exhibition was meant to be a way to have children think of doing ...,you know when they do homeworks at home?,Instead of having a tray with two peas, I was hoping that they would go,into the kitchen cabinet or the mother's handbag,and do their museum-quality design collection on a tray. 
 So, everybody's always suggesting new humble masterpieces,,and at MoMA we put out some books,just for people to suggest their own humble masterpieces.,And when you do that, usually you get 80 percent porn and 20 percent real suggestions,,and instead it was all -- almost -- all good suggestions. 
 And a lot of nationalism came in.,For instance, I didn't know that the Spaniards invented the mop,,but they were very proud,so every Spaniard said "la frego." And Italians did the pizza.,And I wanted to show you, also, the suggestions from Kentucky are pretty good --,they had moonshine, laundry detergents and liquid nails. 
 And I keep it going, and I just got,,(Laughter),also, this suggestion from Milan:,it's our traffic divider, which we call "panettone," and it's painted;,it's these beautiful concrete things that you use around Milan,to define all the lanes of traffic.,So, think of your own,,send them on if you want to -- they're always welcome. 
 But an exhibition like that made me understand even more,what I've been thinking of for 13 years ever since I got to MoMA.,I'm Italian. In Italy, design is normal.,Different parts of the world have a knack for different things.,I was just recently in Argentina and in Uruguay,,and the default way of building homes in the country is a beautiful modernism,that you don't see elsewhere, but the contemporary art was terrible. 
 In Italy, in Milan especially,,contemporary art really doesn't have that much of a place.,But design -- oh, my God.,What you find at the store at the corner, without going to any kind of fancy store,,is the kind of refined design that makes everybody think that,we are all so sophisticated.,It's just what you find at the store. 
 And New York has another kind of knack for contemporary art.,I'm always amazed -- three-year-olds know who Richard Serra is,and take you to the galleries.,But design, for some reason, is still misunderstood for decoration.,It's really interesting:,what many people think when I say the word "design" is they think of,this kind of overdesigned -- in this case, it's overdesigned on purpose, but --,decoration, interior decoration.,They think of somebody choosing fabrics. 
 Design can be that, of course, but it can also be this.,It can be a school of design in Jerusalem that tries to find a better way,to design gas masks for people,,because, as you know, Israel deploys one gas mask per person including babies.,So, what these designers do is they find a way to lower the neckline,,so that instead of being completely strangled, a teenager can also sip a Coke. 
 They tried to make a toddler's gas mask in such a way that the toddler,can be held by the parent because proximity of the body is so important.,And then they make a little tent for the baby.,However cruel, however ruthless you can think this is it's a great design,,and it is miles away from the fancy furniture,,but still, it's part of my same field of passion. 
 What I've been doing at MoMA since the beginning is to try to,harness the power of MoMA,because it's great to work there. You really have power,in that people usually tend to know about your exhibition or see the exhibitions,,and that is power because in a design museum I wouldn't have as many visitors.,I'm very well aware that 80 percent of my public is there to see Picasso and Matisse,,and then they stumble upon my show and I keep them there. 
 But what I've been trying to do is something that the curators at MoMA,in my department have been doing ever since the museum was founded in 1929,,which is to try and see what's going on in the world,and try to use that authority in order to make things better.,There have been many episodes,,and actually Eames Demetrius may be here in the audience,,but in two instances, his great-grandfather, grandfather --,I'm always a little perplexed about the relation, exactly --,Charles Eames the first time and then Charles and Ray Eames the second time,were involved in two competitions:,one in 1940, it was about organic furniture, and the second one in 1948,was low-cost furniture for the GIs coming back from the war,that then sparked a whole line of furniture.,And then there was good design for very low price.,There were a lot of programs in architecture and design that were about,pointing people in the direction of a better design for a better life. 
 So, I started out in '95 with this exhibition that was called,Mutant Materials in Contemporary Design.,It was about a new phase, in my opinion, in the world of design,in that materials could be customized by the designers themselves.,And that put me in touch with such diverse design examples as the aerogels,from the Lawrence Livermore Lab in California;,at that time, they were beginning to be brought into the civilian market.,And at the same time, the gorgeous work of Takeshi Ishiguro, who did these,beautiful salt-and-pepper containers that are made of rice dough.,So you see, the range is really quite diverse. 
 And then, for instance, this other exhibition,that was entitled Workspheres in 2001,,where I asked different designers to come up with ideas for,the new type of work styles that were happening in the world at that time.,And you see IDEO there.,It was beautiful -- it was called Personal Skies.,The idea was that if you had a cubicle, you could project a sky on top,of your head and have your own "Cielo in Una Stanza" -- a sky in a room --,it's a very famous Italian song. 
 And other examples: this was Marti Guixe about working on the go,,and Hella Jongerius, my favorite, about how to work at home.,And this lets me introduce a very important idea about design:,designers are the biggest synthesizers in the world.,What they do best is make a synthesis of human needs,,current conditions in economy, in materials, in sustainability issues,,and then what they do at the end -- if they are good --,is much more than the sum of its parts. 
 Hella Jongerius is a person that is able to make a synthesis,that is really quite amazing,and also quite hilarious.,The idea behind her work was that,at that time, everybody was saying you have to really divide your life.,Instead, she said, "No, no. Work and leisure can be together.",Yeah, that's particularly gorgeous -- it's the TV dinner of 2001. 
 There have been many other exhibitions in the meantime,,but I don't want to focus on my shows.,I would like, instead, to talk about how great some designers are.,I've always had a hard time with the word "maverick.",I came to the United States 13 years ago, and to this day,I have to ask, "What does that mean?",So, this morning I went to see on the dictionary and it said that,there was this gentleman that was not branding its cattle.,Therefore, he was not following everybody's lead,,and therefore, he was a maverick.,So, designers do need to be mavericks,,because the best way to design a successful object --,and also an object that we were missing before --,is to pretend that either it never existed,or that people will be able to have a new behavior with it. 
 So, Safe is the last exhibition that I did at MoMA,and it ended at the beginning of last year.,It was about design that deals with safety and deals with protection.,It's a long story because it started before 2001 and it was called Emergency.,And then when 9/11 happened, I had a shock and I canceled the exhibition,until, slowly but surely, it came back --,as a half-full glass instead of half-empty --,and it was about protection and safety. 
 But it ranged from such items as a complete de-mining equipment to,these kind of water-sterilizing straws,,so it was really wide-ranging.,It also had ... you know, Cameron and I worked a little bit together,,and some of the entries that you see in his website were actually in the exhibition.,But what is interesting is that we don't need to talk about design and art anymore;,design uses whatever tools it has at its disposal in order to make a point.,It's a sense of economy and a sense, also, of humor. 
 This is a beautiful project by Ralph Borland, who's South African.,It's a suit for civil disobedience.,The idea is that when you have a riot or a protest,and the police comes towards you, you're wearing this thing --,it's like a big heart and it has a loudspeaker over your heart,so your heartbeat is amplified --,and the police is reminded;,it's like having a flower in front of the rifle.,And also, you can imagine, a whole group of people with the same suit,will have this mounting collective heartbeat that will be scary to the police. 
 So, designers sometimes don't do things that are immediately,functional, but they're functional to our understanding of issues.,Tony Dunne and Fiona Raby,did this series of objects that are about our anguish and our paranoia,,like this hideaway furniture that's made in the same wood as your floor,so it disappears completely and you can hide away;,or even better, the huggable atomic mushroom, which got me an article,on the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists of the United States --,I don't think it ever happened before at MoMA;,or this Faraday Chair that is supposed to protect you from radiations. 
 But the interesting thing in the exhibition is the discovery that,the ultimate shelter is your sense of self,,and there are quite a few designers that are working on this particular topic.,This is Cindy van den Bremen, who is a Dutch designer,that's done this series of Capsters.,They are athletic gear for Muslim women that enable them to ski, play tennis,,do whatever they want to do without having to uncap themselves. 
 And sometimes by doing this kind of research,,you encounter such beautiful ideas of design.,Twan Verdonck is really young, I think he's 27, and working together with,some psychologist he did a series of toys that are for sensorial,stimulation for children that have psychological impairments.,They're quite beautiful.,They range from this fluffy toy that is about hugging you --,because autistic children like to be hugged tight, so it has a spring inside --,all the way to this doll with a mirror so the child can see him or herself,in the mirror and regain a sense of self. 
 Design really looks upon the whole world,and it considers the world in all of its different ranges.,I was recently at a conference on luxury organized by the Herald Tribune in Istanbul.,And it was really interesting because I was the last speaker,and before me there were people that were really talking about luxury,,and I didn't want to be a party pooper but at the same time,I felt that I had to kind of bring back the discourse to reality. 
 And the truth is that there are very different kinds of luxury,,and there's luxury that is relative for people that don't have that much.,I want to make this point by showing you two examples of,design coming from a sense of economy -- very, very clear limits.,This is Cuba, and this is the recycling of a squeaky toy as a bicycle bell,,and this is a raincoat that is made out of rice sacks.,So they're quite beautiful, but they're beautiful because,they're so smart and economical. 
 And here is the work of two brothers from Sao Paulo,,Fernando and Humberto Campana, who got inspired by the poverty and,smartness that they saw around them to do pieces of furniture that now are,selling for an enormous amount of money.,But that's because of the kind of strangeness of the market itself. 
 So really, design takes everything into account,,and the interesting thing is that as the technology advances,,as we become more and more wireless and impalpable,,designers, instead, want us to be hands-on.,Sometimes hammer-on.,This is a whole series of furniture that wants to engage you physically.,Even this chair that you have to open up and then sit on so that it takes,your imprint, all the way to this beautiful series of objects,that are considered design by Ana Mir in Barcelona.,From this kind of bijou made with human hair to these chocolate nipples,to these intra-toe candies that your lover is supposed to suck from your toes.,(Laughter) 
 It's quite beautiful because somehow, this is a gorgeous moment for design.,Many years ago I heard a mathematician from Vienna, whose name was Marchetti,,explain how the innovation in the military industry --,therefore, secret innovation -- and the innovation in the,civilian society are two sinusoids that are kind of opposed.,And that makes sense.,In moments of war there's great technological innovation,,and in the world you have to do without --,well, during the Second World War, you had to do without steel,,you had to do without aluminum.,And then as peace comes, all of these technologies get all of a sudden,available for the civilian market.,Many of you might know that the Potato Chip Chair,by Charles and Ray Eames comes exactly from that kind of instance:,fiberglass was available for civilian use all of a sudden. 
 I think that this is a strange moment.,The rhythm of the sinusoids has changed tremendously,,just like the rhythm of our life in the past 25 years,,so I'm not sure anymore what the wavelength is.,But it surely is a very important moment for design,,because not only is the technology proceeding, not only is computing,technology making open-source possible also in the world of design,,but also the idea of sustainability --,which is not only sustainability from the viewpoint of CO2 emissions and footprint,,but also sustainability of human interrelationships --,is very much part of the work of so many designers.,And that's why designers, more and more, are working on behaviors,rather than on objects.,Especially the good ones, not all of them. 
 I wanted to show you, for instance, the work of Mathieu Lehanneur,,which is quite fantastic.,He's another young designer from France who's working --,and at this point he's working, also, with pharmaceutical companies --,on new ways to engage patients, especially children,,in taking their medicines with constancy and with certainty. 
 For instance, this is a beautiful container for asthma medicine,that kind of inflates itself when it's time for you to take the medicine,,so the child has to go -- pffff! -- to release and relieve the container itself.,And this other medicine is something that you can draw on your skin,,so intradermal delivery enables you to joyfully be involved,in this particular kind of delivery.,Similarly, there's the work of people like Marti Guixe that tries to involve,you in a way that is really about making everything pass through your mouth,so that you learn from your mistakes or from your taste, orally. 
 The next show that I'm going to work on --,and I've been bugging a lot of you about this here --,is about the relationship between design and science.,I'm trying to find not the metaphors, but, rather, the points in common --,the common gripes, the common issues, the common preoccupations --,and I think that it will enable us to go a little further in this idea of design,as an instruction, as a direction rather than a prescription of form. 
 And I am hoping that many of you will respond to this.,I've sent an email already to quite a few of you.,But design and science and the possibility of visualizing different scales,,and therefore, really work at the scale of the very small,to make it very big and very meaningful.,Thank you. (Applause)What I'd like to do is just drag us all down into the gutter,,and actually all the way down into the sewer,because I want to talk about diarrhea.,And in particular, I want to talk about,the design of diarrhea.,And when evolutionary biologists talk about design,,they really mean design by natural selection.,And that brings me to the title of the talk,,"Using Evolution to Design Disease Organisms Intelligently.",And I also have a little bit of a sort of smartass subtitle to this.,But I'm not just doing this to be cute.,I really think that this subtitle explains,what somebody like me, who's sort of a Darwin wannabe,,how they actually look at one's role in,sort of coming into this field of health sciences and medicine.,It's really not a very friendly field for evolutionary biologists.,You actually see a great potential,,but you see a lot of people who are sort of defending their turf,,and may actually be very resistant, when one tries,to introduce ideas. 
 So, all of the talk today is going to deal with two general questions.,One is that, why are some disease organisms more harmful?,And a very closely related question, which is,,how can we take control of this situation once we understand,the answer to the first question?,How can we make the harmful organisms more mild?,And I'm going to be talking, to begin with, as I said,,about diarrheal disease organisms.,And the focus when I'm talking about the diarrheal organisms,,as well as the focus when I'm talking about any organisms,that cause acute infectious disease,,is to think about the problem from a germ's point of view,,germ's-eye view.,And in particular, to think about a fundamental idea,which I think makes sense out of a tremendous amount of variation,in the harmfulness of disease organisms.,And that idea is that from the germ's-eye point of view,,disease organisms have to get from one host to another,,and often they have to rely on the well-being of the host,to move them to another host. 
 But not always.,Sometimes, you get disease organisms,that don't rely on host mobility at all for transmission.,And when you have that, then evolutionary theory tells us,that natural selection will favor the more exploitative,,more predator-like organisms.,So, natural selection will favor organisms,that are more likely to cause damage.,If instead transmission to another host requires host mobility,,then we expect that the winners of the competition,will be the milder organisms.,So, if the pathogen doesn't need the host to be healthy and active,,and actual selection favors pathogens,that take advantage of those hosts,,the winners in the competition are those that exploit the hosts,for their own reproductive success.,But if the host needs to be mobile in order to transmit the pathogen,,then it's the benign ones that tend to be the winners. 
 So, I'm going to begin by applying this idea to diarrheal diseases.,Diarrheal disease organisms get transmitted in basically three ways.,They can be transmitted from person-to-person contact,,person-to-food-then-to-person contact,,when somebody eats contaminated food,,or they can be transmitted through the water.,And when they're transmitted through the water,,unlike the first two modes of transmission,,these pathogens don't rely on a healthy host for transmission.,A person can be sick in bed and still infect tens, even hundreds,of other individuals.,To sort of illustrate that, this diagram emphasizes that,if you've got a sick person in bed,,somebody's going to be taking out the contaminated materials.,They're going to wash those contaminated materials,,and then the water may move into sources of drinking water.,People will come in to those places where you've got,contaminated drinking water,,bring things back to the family,,may drink right at that point.,The whole point is that a person who can't move,can still infect many other individuals. 
 And so, the theory tells us that,when diarrheal disease organisms are transported by water,,we expect them to be more predator-like, more harmful.,And you can test these ideas.,So, one way you can test is just look at all diarrheal bacteria,,and see whether or not the ones that tend to be,more transmitted by water, tend to be more harmful.,And the answer is -- yep, they are.,Now I put those names in there just for the bacteria buffs,,but the main point here is that --,(Laughter),there's a lot of them here, I can tell --,the main point here is that those data points,all show a very strong, positive association between,the degree to which a disease organism is transmitted by water,,and how harmful they are,,how much death they cause per untreated infection.,So this suggests we're on the right track.,But this, to me, suggests that we really need,to ask some additional questions. 
 Remember the second question that I raised at the outset was,,how can we use this knowledge,to make disease organisms evolve to be mild?,Now, this suggests that if you could just block waterborne transmission,,you could cause disease organisms to shift from,the right-hand side of that graph to the left-hand side of the graph.,But it doesn't tell you how long.,I mean, if this would require thousands of years,,then it's worthless in terms of controlling of these pathogens.,But if it could occur in just a few years,,then it might be a very important way to control,some of the nasty problems that we haven't been able to control.,In other words, this suggests that we could,domesticate these organisms.,We could make them evolve to be not so harmful to us. 
 And so, as I was thinking about this, I focused on this organism,,which is the El Tor biotype of the organism called Vibrio cholerae.,And that is the species of organism that is responsible,for causing cholera.,And the reason I thought this is a really great organism to look at,is that we understand why it's so harmful.,It's harmful because it produces a toxin,,and that toxin is released when the organism,gets into our intestinal tract.,It causes fluid to flow from the cells that line our intestine,into the lumen, the internal chamber of our intestine,,and then that fluid goes the only way it can, which is out the other end.,And it flushes out thousands of different other competitors,that would otherwise make life difficult for the Vibrios. 
 So what happens, if you've got an organism,,it produces a lot of toxin.,After a few days of infection you end up having --,the fecal material really isn't so disgusting as we might imagine.,It's sort of cloudy water.,And if you took a drop of that water,,you might find a million diarrheal organisms.,If the organism produced a lot of toxin,,you might find 10 million, or 100 million.,If it didn't produce a lot of this toxin,,then you might find a smaller number.,So the task is to try to figure out,how to determine whether or not you could get an organism like this,to evolve towards mildness by blocking waterborne transmission,,thereby allowing the organism only to be transmitted,by person-to-person contact,,or person-food-person contact --,both of which would really require that people be,mobile and fairly healthy for transmission. 
 Now, I can think of some possible experiments.,One would be to take a lot of different strains of this organism --,some that produce a lot of toxins, some that produce a little --,and take those strains and spew them out in different countries.,Some countries that might have clean water supplies,,so that you can't get waterborne transmission:,you expect the organism to evolve to mildness there.,Other countries, in which you've got a lot of waterborne transmission,,there you expect these organisms to evolve,towards a high level of harmfulness, right?,There's a little ethical problem in this experiment.,I was hoping to hear a few gasps at least.,That makes me worry a little bit. 
 (Laughter) 
 But anyhow, the laughter makes me feel a little bit better.,And this ethical problem's a big problem.,Just to emphasize this, this is what we're really talking about.,Here's a girl who's almost dead.,She got rehydration therapy, she perked up,,within a few days she was looking like a completely different person.,So, we don't want to run an experiment like that.,But interestingly, just that thing happened in 1991.,In 1991, this cholera organism got into Lima, Peru,,and within two months it had spread to the neighboring areas.,Now, I don't know how that happened,,and I didn't have anything to do with it, I promise you.,I don't think anybody knows,,but I'm not averse to, once that's happened,,to see whether or not the prediction that we would make,,that I did make before, actually holds up.,Did the organism evolve to mildness in a place like Chile,,which has some of the most well protected water supplies,in Latin America?,And did it evolve to be more harmful in a place like Ecuador,,which has some of the least well protected?,And Peru's got something sort of in between. 
 And so, with funding from the Bosack-Kruger Foundation,,I got a lot of strains from these different countries,and we measured their toxin production in the lab.,And we found that in Chile -- within two months of the invasion of Peru,you had strains entering Chile --,and when you look at those strains,,in the very far left-hand side of this graph,,you see a lot of variation in the toxin production.,Each dot corresponds to an islet from a different person --,a lot of variation on which natural selection can act.,But the interesting point is, if you look over the 1990s,,within a few years the organisms evolved to be more mild.,They evolved to produce less toxin.,And to just give you a sense of how important this might be,,if we look in 1995, we find that there's only one case of cholera,,on average, reported from Chile every two years. 
 So, it's controlled.,That's how much we have in America,,cholera that's acquired endemically,,and we don't think we've got a problem here.,They didn't -- they solved the problem in Chile.,But, before we get too confident, we'd better look at some of those other countries,,and make sure that this organism doesn't just always evolve toward mildness.,Well, in Peru it didn't.,And in Ecuador -- remember, this is the place where it has,the highest potential waterborne transmission --,it looked like it got more harmful.,In every case there's a lot of variation,,but something about the environment the people are living in,,and I think the only realistic explanation is that it's,the degree of waterborne transmission,,favored the harmful strains in one place, and mild strains in another. 
 So, this is very encouraging,,it suggests that something that we might want to do anyhow,,if we had enough money, could actually give us a much bigger bang for the buck.,It would make these organisms evolve to mildness,,so that even though people might be getting infected,,they'd be infected with mild strains.,It wouldn't be causing severe disease.,But there's another really interesting aspect of this,,and this is that if you could control the evolution of virulence,,evolution of harmfulness,,then you should be able to control antibiotic resistance.,And the idea is very simple.,If you've got a harmful organism,,a high proportion of the people are going to be symptomatic,,a high proportion of the people are going to be going to get antibiotics.,You've got a lot of pressure favoring antibiotic resistance,,so you get increased virulence leading to,the evolution of increased antibiotic resistance.,And once you get increased antibiotic resistance,,the antibiotics aren't knocking out the harmful strains anymore.,So, you've got a higher level of virulence. 
 So, you get this vicious cycle.,The goal is to turn this around.,If you could cause an evolutionary decrease in virulence,by cleaning up the water supply,,you should be able to get an evolutionary decrease,in antibiotic resistance.,So, we can go to the same countries and look and see.,Did Chile avoid the problem of antibiotic resistance,,whereas did Ecuador actually have the beginnings of the problem?,If we look in the beginning of the 1990s,,we see, again, a lot of variation.,In this case, on the Y-axis, we've just got a measure of antibiotic sensitivity --,and I won't go into that.,But we've got a lot of variation in antibiotic sensitivity in Chile,,Peru and Ecuador, and no trend across the years.,But if we look at the end of the 1990s, just half a decade later,,we see that in Ecuador they started having a resistance problem.,Antibiotic sensitivity was going down.,And in Chile, you still had antibiotic sensitivity. 
 So, it looks like Chile dodged two bullets.,They got the organism to evolve to mildness,,and they got no development of antibiotic resistance.,Now, these ideas should apply across the board,,as long as you can figure out why some organisms evolved to virulence.,And I want to give you just one more example,,because we've talked a little bit about malaria.,And the example I want to deal with is,,or the idea I want to deal with, the question is,,what can we do to try to get the malarial organism to evolve to mildness?,Now, malaria's transmitted by a mosquito,,and normally if you're infected with malaria, and you're feeling sick,,it makes it even easier for the mosquito to bite you. 
 And you can show, just by looking at data from literature,,that vector-borne diseases are more harmful,than non-vector-borne diseases.,But I think there's a really fascinating example,of what one can do experimentally to try to actually demonstrate this.,In the case of waterborne transmission,,we'd like to clean up the water supplies,,see whether or not we can get those organisms to evolve towards mildness.,In the case of malaria, what we'd like to do is mosquito-proof houses.,And the logic's a little more subtle here.,If you mosquito-proof houses,,when people get sick, they're sitting in bed --,or in mosquito-proof hospitals, they're sitting in a hospital bed --,and the mosquitoes can't get to them. 
 So, if you're a harmful variant,in a place where you've got mosquito-proof housing, then you're a loser.,The only pathogens that get transmitted,are the ones that are infecting people that feel healthy enough,to walk outside and get mosquito bites.,So, if you were to mosquito proof houses,,you should be able to get these organisms to evolve to mildness.,And there's a really wonderful experiment that was done,that suggests that we really should go ahead and do this.,And that experiment was done in Northern Alabama.,Just to give you a little perspective on this,,I've given you a star at the intellectual center of the United States,,which is right there in Louisville, Kentucky.,And this really cool experiment was done,about 200 miles south of there, in Northern Alabama,,by the Tennessee Valley Authority.,They had dammed up the Tennessee River.,They'd caused the water to back up,,they needed electric, hydroelectric power.,And when you get stagnant water, you get mosquitoes.,They found in the late '30s -- 10 years after they'd made these dams --,that the people in Northern Alabama were infected with malaria,,about a third to half of them were infected with malaria. 
 This shows you the positions of some of these dams.,OK, so the Tennessee Valley Authority was in a little bit of a bind.,There wasn't DDT, there wasn't chloroquines: what do they do?,Well, they decided to mosquito proof every house in Northern Alabama.,So they did. They divided Northern Alabama into 11 zones,,and within three years, about 100 dollars per house,,they mosquito proofed every house.,And these are the data.,Every row across here represents one of those 11 zones.,And the asterisks represent the time at which,the mosquito proofing was complete.,And so what you can see is that,just the mosquito-proofed housing, and nothing else,,caused the eradication of malaria.,And this was, incidentally, published in 1949,,in the leading textbook of malaria, called "Boyd's Malariology.",But almost no malaria experts even know it exists.,This is important,,because it tells us that if you have moderate biting densities,,you can eradicate malaria by mosquito proofing houses. 
 Now, I would suggest that you could do this in a lot of places.,Like, you know, just as you get into the malaria zone,,sub-Saharan Africa.,But as you move to really intense biting rate areas, like Nigeria,,you're certainly not going to eradicate.,But that's when you should be favoring evolution towards mildness.,So to me, it's an experiment that's waiting to happen,,and if it confirms the prediction, then,we should have a very powerful tool.,In a way, much more powerful than the kind of tools we're looking at,,because most of what's being done today is,to rely on things like anti-malarial drugs.,And we know that, although it's great to make those,anti-malarial drugs available at really low cost and high frequency,,we know that when you make them highly available,you're going to get resistance to those drugs.,And so it's a short-term solution.,This is a long-term solution. 
 What I'm suggesting here is that we could get evolution,working in the direction we want it to go,,rather than always having to battle evolution as a problem,that stymies our efforts to control the pathogen,,for example with anti-malarial drugs.,So, this table I've given just to emphasize,that I've only talked about two examples.,But as I said earlier, this kind of logic applies across the board,for infectious diseases, and it ought to.,Because when we're dealing with infectious diseases, we're dealing with living systems.,We're dealing with living systems;,we're dealing with systems that evolve.,And so if you do something with those systems,,they're going to evolve one way or another.,And all I'm saying is that we need to figure out how they'll evolve,,so that -- we need to adjust our interventions,to get the most bang for the intervention buck,,so that we can get these organisms to evolve in the direction we want them to go. 
 So, I don't really have time to talk about those things,,but I did want to put them up there,,just to give you a sense that there really are solutions,to controlling the evolution of harmfulness,of some of the nasty pathogens that we're confronted with.,And this links up with a lot of the other ideas that have been talked about.,So, for example, earlier today there was discussion of,,how do you really lower sexual transmission of HIV?,What this emphasizes is that we need to figure out how it will work.,Will it maybe get lowered if we alter the economy of the area?,It may get lowered if we intervene in ways that,encourage people to stay more faithful to partners, and so on. 
 But the key thing is to figure out how to lower it,,because if we lower it, we'll get an evolutionary change in the virus.,And the data really do support this:,that you actually do get the virus evolving towards mildness.,And that will just add to the effectiveness of our control efforts.,So the other thing I really like about this,,besides the fact that it brings a whole new dimension,into the study of control of disease,,is that often the kinds of interventions that you want,,that it indicates should be done,,are the kinds of interventions that people want anyhow.,But people just haven't been able to justify the cost. 
 So, this is the kind of thing I'm talking about.,If we know that we're going to get extra bang for the buck from providing clean water,,then I think that we can say,,let's push the effort into that aspect of the control,,so that we can actually solve the problem,,even though, if you just look at the frequency of infection,,you would suggest that you can't solve the problem well enough,just by cleaning up water supply.,Anyhow, I'll end that there, and thank you very much. 
 (Applause)There's an ancient and universal conceptnthat words have power,,that spells exist,,and that if we could onlynpronounce the right words,,then -- whoosh! -- you know,nan avalanche would come,and wipe out the hobbits, right?,So this is a very attractive idea,,because we're very lazy,nlike the Sorcerer's Apprentice,,or the world's greatestncomputer programmer.,This idea has a lot of traction with us. 
 We love the idea that words,nwhen pronounced,,are little more than pure information,,but they evoke physical actionnin the real world,that helps us do work.,So, of course, with lotsnof programmable computers,and robots around,,this is an easy thing to picture. 
 How many of you knownwhat I'm talking about?,Raise your right hand.,How many don't knownwhat I'm talking about?,Raise your left hand.,So that's great. So that was too easy.,You guys have very insecure computers, OK?,So now the thing is,nthis is a different kind of spell.,This is a computer programnmade of zeros and ones.,It can be pronounced on a computer,ndoes something like this.,The important thing is we can write itnin a high-level language. 
 A computer magician can write this thing.,It can be compiled into zeros and onesnand pronounced by a computer.,And that's what makes computers powerful,,these high-level languagesnthat can be compiled.,And so, I'm here to tell you,nyou don't need a computer,to actually have a spell.,In fact, what you can donat the molecular level,is that if you encode information --,you encode a spellnor program as molecules --,then physics can actually directlyninterpret that information,and run a program. 
 It's what happens in proteins.,When this amino-acid sequencengets pronounced as atoms,,these little lettersnare sticky for each other.,It collapses into a three-dimensionalnshape that turns it into a nanomachine,that actually cuts DNA.,The interesting thingnis that if you change the sequence,,you change the three-dimensional folding.,You get, now, a DNA stapler, instead.,These are the kind of molecular programsnwe want to be able to write.,The problem is, we don't know,the machine language of proteinsnor have a compiler for proteins. 
 So I've joined a growing band of people,that try to makenmolecular spells using DNA.,We use DNA because it's cheaper,nit's easier to handle,,it's somethingnwe understand really well --,so well, in fact, that we thinknwe can actually write,programming languages for DNAnand have molecular compilers. 
 So then, we think we can do that.,One of my first questions doing this was:,How can you make an arbitrary shapenor pattern out of DNA?,I decided to use a type of DNA origami,,where you take a long strand of DNA,and fold it into whatever shapenor pattern you might want.,So here's a shape.,I actually spent about a year in my homenin my underwear, coding,,like Linus [Torvalds],nin that picture before.,This program takes a shapenand spits out 250 DNA sequences.,These short DNA sequencesnare what are going to fold the long strand,into this shape that we want to make.,So you send an e-mailnwith these sequences in it,to a company,,and the company pronounces themnon a DNA synthesizer,,a machine about the size of a photocopier.,And they take your e-mail,,and every letter in your e-mail,nthey replace with a 30-atom cluster --,one for each letter, A, T, C and G in DNA. 
 They string them up in the right sequence,,and then they send themnback to you via FedEx.,So you get 250 of thesenin the mail in little tubes.,I mix them together,nadd a little bit of salt water,,and then add this long strandnI was telling you about,,that I've stolen from a virus.,And then what happens is,,you heat this whole thing upnto about boiling.,You cool it down to room temperature,,and as you do, those short strandsndo the following thing:,each one of them bindsnthat long strand in one place,,and then has a second half that bindsnthat long strand in a distant place,,and brings those two partsnof the long strand,close together so they stick together. 
 So the net effectnof all 250 of these strands,is to fold the long strandninto the shape you're looking for.,It'll approximate that shape.,We do this for real, in the test tube.,In each little drop of water,nyou get 50 billion of these guys.,With a microscope,nyou can see them on a surface.,The neat thing is if you changenthe sequence and change the spell,,just change the sequence of the staples,,you can make a moleculenthat looks like this.,And, you know, he likesnto hang out with his buddies.,A lot of them are actually pretty good. 
 If you change the spell again,nyou change the sequence again,,you get really nice,n130-nanometer triangles.,If you do it again,,you can get arbitrary patterns.,So on a rectangle, you can paintnpatterns of North and South America,,or the words, "DNA." 
 So that's DNA origami. That's one way.,There are many waysnof casting molecular spells using DNA.,What we really want to do in the end,is learn how to program self-assemblynso we can build anything, right?,We want to be able to buildntechnological artifacts,that are maybe good for the world.,We want to learn how to buildnbiological artifacts,,like people and whales and trees.,And if it's the case that we can reachnthat level of complexity,,if our ability to program moleculesngets to be that good,,then that will truly be magic. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)You will understand nothing with my type of English.,It's good for you because you can have a break after all these fantastic people.,I must tell you I am like that, not very comfortable,,because usually, in life, I think my job is absolutely useless.,I mean, I feel useless.,Now after Carolyn, and all the other guys, I feel like shit.,And definitively, I don't know why I am here,,but -- you know the nightmare you can have, like you are an impostor,,you arrive at the opera, and they push you, "You must sing!",I don't know. (Laughter) 
 So, so, because I have nothing to show, nothing to say,,we shall try to speak about something else.,We can start, if you want, by understanding --,it's just to start, it's not interesting, but -- how I work.,When somebody comes to me and ask for what I am known,,I mean, yes, lemon squeezer, toilet brush, toothpick, beautiful toilet seats,,and why not -- a toothbrush?,I don't try to design the toothbrush.,I don't try to say, "Oh, that will be a beautiful object," or something like that.,That doesn't interest me. 
 Because there is different types of design.,The one, we can call it the cynical design,,that means the design invented by Raymond Loewy in the '50s,,who said, what is ugly is a bad sale, la laideur se vend mal, which is terrible.,It means the design must be just the weapon for marketing,,for producer to make product more sexy, like that,,they sell more: it's shit, it's obsolete, it's ridiculous.,I call that the cynical design. 
 After, there is the narcissistic design:,it's a fantastic designer who designs only for other fantastic designers. (Laughter),After, there is people like me, who try to deserve to exist,,and who are so ashamed to make this useless job, who try to do it in another way,,and they try, I try, to not make the object for the object but for the result,,for the profit for the human being, the person who will use it.,If we take the toothbrush -- I don't think about the toothbrush.,I think, "What will be the effect of the brush in the mouth?",And to understand what will be the effect of the toothbrush in the mouth,,I must imagine: Who owns this mouth?,What is the life of the owner of this mouth? In what society [does] this guy live?,What civilization creates this society?,What animal species creates this civilization?,When I arrive -- and I take one minute, I am not so intelligent --,when I arrive at the level of animal species, that becomes real interesting. 
 Me, I have strictly no power to change anything.,But when I come back, I can understand why I shall not do it,,because today to not do it, it's more positive than do it, or how I shall do it.,But to come back, where I am at the animal species, there is things to see.,There is things to see, there is the big challenge.,The big challenge in front of us.,Because there is not a human production,which exists outside of what I call "the big image.",The big image is our story, our poetry, our romanticism.,Our poetry is our mutation, our life.,We must remember, and we can see that in any book of my son of 10 years old,,that life appears four billion years ago, around -- four billion point two? 
 Voice offstage: Four point five. 
 Yes, point five, OK, OK, OK! (Laughter) I'm a designer,,that's all, of Christmas gifts.,And before, there was this soup, called "soupe primordiale,",this first soup -- bloop bloop bloop --,sort of dirty mud, no life, nothing.,So then -- pshoo-shoo -- lightning -- pshoo -- arrive --,pshoo-shoo -- makes life -- bloop bloop -- and that dies.,Some million years after -- pshoo-shoo, bloop-bloop -- ah, wake up!,At the end, finally, that succeeds, and life appears.,We was so, so stupid. The most stupid bacteria.,Even, I think, we copy our way to reproduce, you know what I mean,,and something of -- oh no, forget it. 
 After, we become a fish; after, we become a frog;,after, we become a monkey; after, we become what we are today: a super-monkey,,and the fun is, the super-monkey we are today, is at half of the story.,Can you imagine? From that stupid bacteria to us,,with a microphone, with a computer, with an iPod: four billion years.,And we know, and especially Carolyn knows, that when the sun will implode,,the earth will burn, explode, I don't know what,,and this is scheduled for four, four billion years?,Yes, she said, something like that. OK, that means we are at half of the story.,Fantastic! It's a beauty!,Can you imagine? It's very symbolic.,Because the bacteria we was had no idea of what we are today.,And today, we have no idea of what we shall be in four billion years.,And this territory is fantastic. 
 That is our poetry. That is our beautiful story.,It's our romanticism. Mu-ta-tion. We are mutants.,And if we don't deeply understand, if we don't integrate that we are mutants,,we completely miss the story.,Because every generation thinks we are the final one.,We have a way to look at Earth like that, you know,,"I am the man. The final man.,You know, we mutate during four billion years before, but now, because it's me, we stop. Fin. (Laughter),For the end, for the eternity, it is one with a red jacket.",Something like that. I am not sure of that. (Laughter),Because that is our intelligence of mutation and things like that.,There is so many things to do; it's so fresh. 
 And here is something: nobody is obliged to be a genius,,but everybody is obliged to participate.,And to participate, for a mutant, there is a minimum of exercise, a minimum of sport.,We can say that.,The first, if you want -- there is so many --,but one which is very easy to do, is the duty of vision.,I can explain you. I shall try.,If you walk like that, it's OK, it's OK, you can walk,,but perhaps, because you walk with the eyes like that, you will not see, oh, there is a hole.,And you will fall, and you will die. Dangerous. 
 That's why, perhaps, you will try to have this angle of vision.,OK, I can see, if I found something, up, up, and they continue, up up up.,I raise the angle of vision, but it's still very -- selfish, selfish, egoiste -- yes, selfish.,You, you survive. It's OK.,If you raise the level of your eyes a little more you go,,"I see you, oh my God you are here, how are you, I can help you,,I can design for you a new toothbrush, new toilet brush," something like that.,I live in society; I live in community.,It's OK. You start to be in the territory of intelligence, we can say.,From this level, the more you can raise this angle of view,,the more you will be important for the society.,The more you will rise, the more you will be important for the civilization.,The more you will rise, to see far and high, like that,,the more you will be important for the story of our mutation.,That means intelligent people are in this angle. That is intelligence.,From this to here, that, it's genius.,Ptolemy, Eratosthenes, Einstein, things like that.,Nobody's obliged to be a genius.,It's better, but nobody. 
 Take care, in this training, to be a good mutant.,There is some danger, there is some trap. One trap: the vertical.,Because at the vertical of us, if you look like that,,"Ah! my God, there is God. Ah! God!",God is a trap. God is the answer when we don't know the answer.,That means, when your brain is not enough big, when you don't understand,,you go, "Ah, it's God, it's God." That's ridiculous.,That's why -- jump, like that? No, don't jump.,Come back. Because, after, there is another trap.,If you look like that, you look to the past,,or you look inside if you are very flexible, inside yourself.,It's called schizophrenia, and you are dead also. 
 That's why every morning, now, because you are a good mutant,,you will raise your angle of view.,Out, more of the horizontal. You are an intelligence.,Never forget -- like that, like that.,It's very, very, very important.,What, what else we can say about that? Why do that?,It's because we -- if we look from far, we see our line of evolution.,This line of evolution is clearly positive.,From far, this line looks very smooth, like that.,But if you take a lens, like that, this line is ack, ack, ack, ack, ack. Like that.,It's made of light and shadow.,We can say light is civilization, shadow is barbaria.,And it's very important to know where we are.,Because some cycle, there is a spot in the cycle,,and you have not the same duty in the different parts of the cycle. 
 That means, we can imagine -- I don't say it was fantastic,,but in the '80s, there was not too much war, like that, it was --,we can imagine that the civilization can become civilized.,In this case, people like me are acceptable.,We can say, "It's luxurious time.",We have time to think, we have time to I don't know what,,speak about art and things like that.,It's OK. We are in the light.,But sometimes, like today, we fall, we fall so fast, so fast to shadow, we fall so fast to barbaria.,With many, many, many, many face of barbaria.,Because it's not, the barbaria we have today, it's perhaps not the barbaria we think.,There is different type of barbaria.,That's why we must adapt.,That means, when barbaria is back, forget the beautiful chairs, forget the beautiful hotel,,forget design, even -- I'm sorry to say -- forget art.,Forget all that. There is priority; there is urgency.,You must go back to politics, you must go back to radicalization,,I'm sorry if that's not very English.,You must go back to fight, to battle. 
 That's why today I'm so ashamed to make this job.,That's why I am here, to try to do it the best possible.,But I know that even I do it the best possible,-- that's why I'm the best -- it's nothing.,Because it's not the right time.,That's why I say that. I say that, because, I repeat, nothing exist if it's not in the good rhythym,,the rhythym of our beautiful dream, of this civilization.,And because we must all work to finish this story.,Because the scenario of this civilization,-- about love, progress, and things like that -- it's OK,,but there is so many different, other scenarios of other civilizations.,This scenario, of this civilization, was about becoming powerful, intelligent,,like this idea we have invented, this concept of God.,We are God now. We are. It's almost done.,We have just to finish the story.,That is very, very important.,And when you don't understand really what's happened,,you cannot go and fight and work and build and things like that.,You go to the future back, back, back, back, like that.,And you can fall, and it's very dangerous.,No, you must really understand that. 
 Because we have almost finished, I'll repeat this story.,And the beauty of this, in perhaps 50 years, 60 years, we can finish completely this civilization,,and offer to our children the possibility to invent a new story,,a new poetry, a new romanticism.,With billions of people who have been born, worked, lived and died before us,,these people who have worked so much,,we have now bring beautiful things, beautiful gifts, we know so many things.,We can say to our children, OK, done, that was our story. That passed.,Now you have a duty: invent a new story. Invent a new poetry.,The only rule is, we have not to have any idea about the next story.,We give you white pages. Invent.,We give you the best tools, the best tools, and now, do it.,That's why I continue to work, even if it's for toilet brush.(Applause) 
 It's really quite an honor to be here tonight,,and I'm really glad that I stayed here and listened,because I've really been inspired.,And I'm going to play some songs for you tonight,that are, literally, world premieres.,I've been working on my new record,and I've never played these songs for anybody,except the microphone. 
 This is a song that I wrote,about the meaning of technology,,which goes perfectly with this gathering.,I started thinking about -- when I was in college,,especially as a blind person,,doing a research paper was a major undertaking.,You had to go to the library,,see if you could get them to find the books for you,,you know, footnotes and all that.,Now you can just go on Google. Just look it up.,I wish I had that when I was in college.,Anyway, this is a song about:,we have all this, but what are we going to do with it?,It's called "All the Answers."

 Thank you.,Whew! It's a miracle I didn't make any mistakes on that song.,That's the first time I've ever played it.,(Applause),It's a "feel the fear and do it anyway" kind of thing.,This next song is a song 
 that started out as a dream -- a childhood dream.,It was one of the titles,that I was sort of thinking about calling my record,,except there's a couple of problems.,One thing is, it's unpronounceable.,And it's a made-up word.,It's called "Tembererana.",And the song is based on,what I think was my first,childhood attempts,to think about invisible forces.,So "tembererana" was these dreams,,in which I would be running away,from bad feelings -- is the only way I can put it.,So this is called "Tembererana.",It's based on an Argentinian rhythm,called "carnivalito."

 This is a song that came about,because I think it's difficult to be in the world,and not be aware of what's going on,,and the wars and so forth.,This song kind of came out of all of that.,And I wrote a lot of happy songs on my first record,,which I still stand by,,but this has got something else in it.,It's called "Peace on Earth."

 (Applause)Chris Anderson: Welcome to TED. 
 Richard Branson: Thank you very much. The first TED has been great. 
 CA: Have you met anyone interesting? 
 RB: Well, the nice thing about TED is everybody's interesting.,I was very glad to see Goldie Hawn,,because I had an apology to make to her.,I'd had dinner with her about two years ago and I'd --,she had this big wedding ring and I put it on my finger and I couldn't get it off.,And I went home to my wife that night,and she wanted to know why I had another woman's big,,massive, big wedding ring on my finger.,And, anyway, the next morning we had to go along to the jeweler,and get it cut off.,So -- (Laughter) --,so apologies to Goldie. 
 CA: That's pretty good.,So, we're going to put up some slides,of some of your companies here.,You've started one or two in your time.,So, you know, Virgin Atlantic, Virgin Records --,I guess it all started with a magazine called Student.,And then, yes, all these other ones as well. I mean, how do you do this? 
 RB: I read all these sort of TED instructions:,you must not talk about your own business, and this,,and now you ask me.,So I suppose you're not going to be able to kick me off the stage,,since you asked the question.,(Laughter) 
 CA: It depends what the answer is though. 
 RB: No, I mean, I think I learned early on that if you can run one company,,you can really run any companies.,I mean, companies are all about finding the right people,,inspiring those people, you know, drawing out the best in people.,And I just love learning and I'm incredibly inquisitive,and I love taking on, you know, the status quo,and trying to turn it upside down.,So I've seen life as one long learning process.,And if I see -- you know, if I fly on somebody else's airline,and find the experience is not a pleasant one, which it wasn't,,21 years ago, then I'd think, well, you know, maybe I can create,the kind of airline that I'd like to fly on.,And so, you know, so got one secondhand 747 from Boeing and gave it a go. 
 CA: Well, that was a bizarre thing,,because you made this move that a lot of people advised you was crazy.,And in fact, in a way, it almost took down your empire at one point.,I had a conversation with one of the investment bankers who,,at the time when you basically sold Virgin Records,and invested heavily in Virgin Atlantic,,and his view was that you were trading, you know,,the world's fourth biggest record company,for the twenty-fifth biggest airline and that you were out of your mind.,Why did you do that? 
 RB: Well, I think that there's a very thin dividing line between success and failure.,And I think if you start a business without financial backing,,you're likely to go the wrong side of that dividing line.,We had -- we were being attacked by British Airways.,They were trying to put our airline out of business,,and they launched what's become known as the dirty tricks campaign.,And I realized that the whole empire was likely to come crashing down,unless I chipped in a chip.,And in order to protect the jobs of the people who worked for the airline,,and protect the jobs of the people who worked for the record company,,I had to sell the family jewelry to protect the airline. 
 CA: Post-Napster, you're looking like a bit of a genius, actually,,for that as well. 
 RB: Yeah, as it turned out, it proved to be the right move.,But, yeah, it was sad at the time, but we moved on. 
 CA: Now, you use the Virgin brand a lot,and it seems like you're getting synergy from one thing to the other.,What does the brand stand for in your head? 
 RB: Well, I like to think it stands for quality,,that you know, if somebody comes across a Virgin company, they -- 
 CA: They are quality, Richard. Come on now, everyone says quality. Spirit? 
 RB: No, but I was going to move on this.,We have a lot of fun and I think the people who work for it enjoy it.,As I say, we go in and shake up other industries,,and I think, you know, we do it differently,and I think that industries are not quite the same,as a result of Virgin attacking the market. 
 CA: I mean, there are a few launches you've done,where the brand maybe hasn't worked quite as well.,I mean, Virgin Brides -- what happened there?,(Laughter) 
 RB: We couldn't find any customers.,(Laughter),(Applause) 
 CA: I was actually also curious why --,I think you missed an opportunity with your condoms launch. You called it Mates.,I mean, couldn't you have used the Virgin brand for that as well?,Ain't virgin no longer, or something. 
 RB: Again, we may have had problems finding customers.,I mean, we had -- often, when you launch a company and you get customer complaints,,you know, you can deal with them.,But about three months after the launch of the condom company,,I had a letter, a complaint,,and I sat down and wrote a long letter back to this lady apologizing profusely.,But obviously, there wasn't a lot I could do about it.,And then six months later, or nine months after the problem had taken,,I got this delightful letter with a picture of the baby,asking if I'd be godfather, which I became.,So, it all worked out well. 
 CA: Really? You should have brought a picture. That's wonderful. 
 RB: I should have. 
 CA: So, just help us with some of the numbers.,I mean, what are the numbers on this?,I mean, how big is the group overall?,How much -- what's the total revenue? 
 RB: It's about 25 billion dollars now, in total. 
 CA: And how many employees? 
 RB: About 55,000. 
 CA: So, you've been photographed in various ways at various times,and never worrying about putting your dignity on the line or anything like that.,What was that? Was that real? 
 RB: Yeah. We were launching a megastore in Los Angeles, I think.,No, I mean, I think --,CA: But is that your hair?,RB: No.,CA: What was that one? 
 RB: Dropping in for tea. 
 CA: OK.,(Laughter) 
 RB: Ah, that was quite fun. That was a wonderful car-boat in which -- 
 CA: Oh, that car that we -- actually we --,it was a TEDster event there, I think.,Is that -- could you still pause on that one actually, for a minute?,(Laughter) 
 RB: It's a tough job, isn't it? 
 CA: I mean, it is a tough job.,(Laughter),When I first came to America, I used to try this with employees as well,and they kind of -- they have these different rules over here,,it's very strange. 
 RB: I know, I have -- the lawyers say you mustn't do things like that, but -- 
 CA: I mean, speaking of which, tell us about -- 
 RB: "Pammy" we launched, you know --,mistakenly thought we could take on Coca-Cola,,and we launched a cola bottle called "The Pammy",and it was shaped a bit like Pamela Anderson.,But the trouble is, it kept on tipping over, but --,(Laughter) 
 CA: Designed by Philippe Starck perhaps? 
 RB: Of course. 
 CA: So, we'll just run a couple more pictures here. Virgin Brides. Very nice.,And, OK, so stop there. This was -- you had some award I think? 
 RB: Yeah, well, 25 years earlier, we'd launched the Sex Pistols',"God Save The Queen," and I'd certainly never expected,that 25 years later -- that she'd actually knight us.,But somehow, she must have had a forgetful memory, I think. 
 CA: Well, God saved her and you got your just reward.,Do you like to be called Sir Richard, or how? 
 RB: Nobody's ever called me Sir Richard.,Occasionally in America, I hear people saying Sir Richard,and think there's some Shakespearean play taking place.,But nowhere else anyway. 
 CA: OK. So can you use your knighthood for anything or is it just ... 
 RB: No. I suppose if you're having problems,getting a booking in a restaurant or something,,that might be worth using it. 
 CA: You know, it's not Richard Branson. It's Sir Richard Branson. 
 RB: I'll go get the secretary to use it. 
 CA: OK. So let's look at the space thing.,I think, with us, we've got a video that shows what you're up to,,and Virgin Galactic up in the air. (Video),So that's the Bert Rutan designed spaceship? 
 RB: Yeah, it'll be ready in -- well, ready in 12 months,and then we do 12 months extensive testing.,And then 24 months from now,,people will be able to take a ride into space. 
 CA: So this interior is Philippe Starcke designed? 
 RB: Philippe has done the -- yeah, quite a bit of it:,the logos and he's building the space station in New Mexico.,And basically, he's just taken an eye,and the space station will be one giant eye,,so when you're in space,,you ought to be able to see this massive eye looking up at you.,And when you land, you'll be able to go back into this giant eye.,But he's an absolute genius when it comes to design. 
 CA: But you didn't have him design the engine? 
 RB: Philippe is quite erratic,,so I think that he wouldn't be the best person to design the engine, no. 
 CA: He gave a wonderful talk here two days ago. 
 RB: Yeah? No, he is a -- 
 CA: Well, some people found it wonderful,,some people found it completely bizarre.,But, I personally found it wonderful. 
 RB: He's a wonderful enthusiast, which is why I love him. But ... 
 CA: So, now, you've always had this exploration bug in you.,Have you ever regretted that? 
 RB: Many times.,I mean, I think with the ballooning and boating expeditions we've done in the past.,Well, I got pulled out of the sea I think six times by helicopters, so --,and each time, I didn't expect to come home to tell the tale.,So in those moments,,you certainly wonder what you're doing up there or -- 
 CA: What was the closest you got to --,when did you think, this is it, I might be on my way out? 
 RB: Well, I think the balloon adventures were -- each one was,,each one, actually, I think we came close.,And, I mean, first of all we --,nobody had actually crossed the Atlantic in a hot air balloon before,,so we had to build a hot air balloon that was capable of flying in the jet stream,,and we weren't quite sure,,when a balloon actually got into the jet stream,,whether it would actually survive the 200, 220 miles an hour winds that you can find up there.,And so, just the initial lift off from Sugarloaf to cross the Atlantic,,as we were pushing into the jet stream, this enormous balloon --,the top of the balloon ended up going at a couple of hundred miles an hour,,the capsule that we were in at the bottom was going at maybe two miles an hour,,and it just took off.,And it was like holding onto a thousand horses.,And we were just crossing every finger,,praying that the balloon would hold together, which, fortunately, it did.,But the ends of all those balloon trips were, you know --,something seemed to go wrong every time,,and on that particular occasion, the more experienced balloonist who was with me,jumped, and left me holding on for dear life.,(Laughter) 
 CA: Did he tell you to jump, or he just said, "I'm out of here!" and ... 
 RB: No, he told me jump, but once his weight had gone,,the balloon just shot up to 12,000 feet and I ... 
 CA: And you inspired an Ian McEwan novel I think with that. 
 RB: Yeah. No, I put on my oxygen mask and stood on top of the balloon,,with my parachute, looking at the swirling clouds below,,trying to pluck up my courage to jump into the North Sea, which --,and it was a very, very, very lonely few moments.,But, anyway, we managed to survive it. 
 CA: Did you jump? Or it came down in the end? 
 RB: Well, I knew I had about half an hour's fuel left,,and I also knew that the chances were that if I jumped,,I would only have a couple of minutes of life left.,So I climbed back into the capsule and just desperately tried,to make sure that I was making the right decision.,And wrote some notes to my family. And then climbed back up again,,looked down at those clouds again,,climbed back into the capsule again.,And then finally, just thought, there's a better way.,I've got, you know, this enormous balloon above me,,it's the biggest parachute ever, why not use it?,And so I managed to fly the balloon down through the clouds,,and about 50 feet, before I hit the sea, threw myself over.,And the balloon hit the sea,and went shooting back up to 10,000 feet without me.,But it was a wonderful feeling being in that water and -- 
 CA: What did you write to your family? 
 RB: Just what you would do in a situation like that:,just I love you very much. And,I'd already written them a letter before going on this trip, which --,just in case anything had happened.,But fortunately, they never had to use it. 
 CA: Your companies have had incredible PR value out of these heroics.,The years -- and until I stopped looking at the polls,,you were sort of regarded as this great hero in the U.K. and elsewhere.,And cynics might say, you know, this is just a smart business guy,doing what it takes to execute his particular style of marketing.,How much was the PR value part of this?,RB: Well, of course, the PR experts said that as an airline owner,,the last thing you should be doing is heading off in balloons and boats,,and crashing into the seas.,(Laughter) 
 CA: They have a point, Richard. 
 RB: In fact, I think our airline took a full page ad at the time saying,,you know, come on, Richard,,there are better ways of crossing the Atlantic.,(Laughter) 
 CA: To do all this,,you must have been a genius from the get-go, right? 
 RB: Well, I won't contradict that.,(Laughter) 
 CA: OK, this isn't exactly hardball. OK. 
 Didn't -- weren't you just terrible at school? 
 RB: I was dyslexic. I had no understanding of schoolwork whatsoever.,I certainly would have failed IQ tests.,And it was one of the reasons I left school when I was 15 years old.,And if I -- if I'm not interested in something, I don't grasp it.,As somebody who's dyslexic,,you also have some quite bizarre situations.,I mean, for instance, I've had to -- you know,,I've been running the largest group of private companies in Europe,,but haven't been able to know the difference between net and gross.,And so the board meetings have been fascinating.,(Laughter),And so, it's like, good news or bad news?,And generally, the people would say, oh, well that's bad news. 
 CA: But just to clarify, the 25 billion dollars is gross, right? That's gross?,(Laughter) 
 RB: Well, I hope it's net actually, having --,(Laughter) --,I've got it right. 
 CA: No, trust me, it's gross.,(Laughter) 
 RB: So, when I turned 50, somebody took me outside the boardroom and said,,"Look Richard, here's a -- let me draw on a diagram.,Here's a net in the sea,,and the fish have been pulled from the sea into this net.,And that's the profits you've got left over in this little net,,everything else is eaten.",And I finally worked it all out.,(Laughter),(Applause) 
 CA: But, I mean, at school -- so as well as being,,you know, doing pretty miserably academically,,but you were also the captain of the cricket and football teams.,So you were kind of a -- you were a natural leader,,but just a bit of a ... Were you a rebel then, or how would you ... 
 RB: Yeah, I think I was a bit of a maverick and -- but I ... And I was,,yeah, I was fortunately good at sport,,and so at least I had something to excel at, at school. 
 CA: And some bizarre things happened just earlier in your life.,I mean, there's the story about your mother,allegedly dumping you in a field, aged four, and saying "OK, walk home.",Did this really happen? 
 RB: She was, you know,,she felt that we needed to stand on our own two feet from an early age.,So she did things to us, which now she'd be arrested for,,such as pushing us out of the car,,and telling us to find our own way to Granny's,,about five miles before we actually got there.,And making us go on wonderful, long bike rides.,And we were never allowed to watch television and the like. 
 CA: But is there a risk here?,I mean, there's a lot of people in the room who are wealthy, and they've got kids,,and we've got this dilemma about how you bring them up.,Do you look at the current generation of kids coming up and think,they're too coddled, they don't know what they've got,,we're going to raise a generation of privileged ... 
 RB: No, I think if you're bringing up kids,,you just want to smother them with love and praise and enthusiasm.,So I don't think you can mollycoddle your kids too much really. 
 CA: You didn't turn out too bad, I have to say, I'm ...,Your headmaster said to you --,I mean he found you kind of an enigma at your school --,he said, you're either going to be a millionaire or go to prison,,and I'm not sure which.,Which of those happened first?,(Laughter) 
 RB: Well, I've done both. I think I went to prison first.,I was actually prosecuted under two quite ancient acts in the U.K.,I was prosecuted under the 1889 Venereal Diseases Act,and the 1916 Indecent Advertisements Act.,On the first occasion, for mentioning the word venereal disease in public, which --,we had a center where we would help young people who had problems.,And one of the problems young people have is venereal disease.,And there's an ancient law that says,you can't actually mention the word venereal disease or print it in public.,So the police knocked on the door, and told us they were going to arrest us,if we carried on mentioning the word venereal disease.,We changed it to social diseases,and people came along with acne and spots,,but nobody came with VD any more.,So, we put it back to VD and promptly got arrested.,And then subsequently, "Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols,",the word bollocks, the police decided was a rude word and so we were arrested,for using the word bollocks on the Sex Pistols' album.,And John Mortimer, the playwright, defended us.,And he asked if I could find a linguistics expert,to come up with a different definition of the word bollocks.,And so I rang up Nottingham University,,and I asked to talk to the professor of linguistics.,And he said, "Look, bollocks is not a -- has nothing to do with balls whatsoever.,It's actually a nickname given to priests in the eighteenth century.",(Laughter),And he went, "Furthermore, I'm a priest myself.",And so I said, "Would you mind coming to the court?",And he said he'd be delighted. And I said --,and he said, "Would you like me to wear my dog collar?",And I said, "Yes, definitely. Please.",(Laughter) 
 CA: That's great. 
 RB: So our key witness argued that it was actually,"Never Mind the Priest, Here's the Sex Pistols.",(Laughter),And the judge found us -- reluctantly found us not guilty, so ...,(Laughter) 
 CA: That is outrageous.,(Applause),So seriously, is there a dark side?,A lot of people would say there's no way,that someone could put together this incredible collection of businesses,without knifing a few people in the back,,you know, doing some ugly things.,You've been accused of being ruthless.,There was a nasty biography written about you by someone.,Is any of it true? Is there an element of truth in it? 
 RB: I don't actually think that the stereotype,of a businessperson treading all over people to get to the top,,generally speaking, works.,I think if you treat people well,,people will come back and come back for more.,And I think all you have in life is your reputation,and it's a very small world.,And I actually think that the best way,of becoming a successful business leader is dealing with people fairly and well,,and I like to think that's how we run Virgin. 
 CA: And what about the people who love you and who see you spending --,you keep getting caught up in these new projects,,but it almost feels like you're addicted to launching new stuff.,You get excited by an idea and, kapow!,I mean, do you think about life balance?,How do your family feel about,each time you step into something big and new? 
 RB: I also believe that being a father's incredibly important,,so from the time the kids were very young,,you know, when they go on holiday, I go on holiday with them.,And so we spend a very good sort of three months away together.,Yes, I'll, you know, be in touch. We're very lucky,,we have this tiny little island in the Caribbean and we can --,so I can take them there and we can bring friends,,and we can play together,,but I can also keep in touch with what's going on. 
 CA: You started talking in recent years,about this term capitalist philanthropy.,What is that? 
 RB: Capitalism has been proven to be a system that works.,You know, the alternative, communism, has not worked.,But the problem with capitalism is,extreme wealth ends up in the hands of a few people,,and therefore extreme responsibility, I think, goes with that wealth.,And I think it's important that the individuals,,who are in that fortunate position, do not end up competing,for bigger and bigger boats, and bigger and bigger cars,,but, you know, use that money to either create new jobs,or to tackle issues around the world. 
 CA: And what are the issues that you worry about most, care most about,,want to turn your resources toward? 
 RB: Well, there's -- I mean there's a lot of issues.,I mean global warming certainly is a massive threat to mankind,and we are putting a lot of time and energy into,,A, trying to come up with alternative fuels,and, B, you know, we just launched this prize, which is really a prize,in case we don't get an answer on alternative fuels,,in case we don't actually manage to get the carbon emissions,cut down quickly, and in case we go through the tipping point.,We need to try to encourage people to come up with a way,of extracting carbon out of the Earth's atmosphere.,And we just -- you know, there weren't really people,working on that before, so we wanted people to try to --,all the best brains in the world to start thinking about that,,and also to try to extract the methane,out of the Earth's atmosphere as well.,And actually, we've had about 15,000 people fill in the forms,saying they want to give it a go.,And so we only need one, so we're hopeful. 
 CA: And you're also working in Africa on a couple of projects? 
 RB: Yes, I mean, we've got -- we're setting up something called,the war room, which is maybe the wrong word.,We're trying to -- maybe we'll change it -- but anyway, it's a war room,to try to coordinate all the attack that's going on in Africa,,all the different social problems in Africa,,and try to look at best practices.,So, for instance,,there's a doctor in Africa that's found that,if you give a mother antiretroviral drugs at 24 weeks, when she's pregnant,,that the baby will not have HIV when it's born.,And so disseminating that information to,around the rest of Africa is important. 
 CA: The war room sounds, it sounds powerful and dramatic.,And is there a risk that the kind of the business heroes of the West,get so excited about -- I mean, they're used to having an idea,,getting stuff done, and they believe profoundly,in their ability to make a difference in the world.,Is there a risk that we go to places like Africa and say,,we've got to fix this problem and we can do it,,I've got all these billions of dollars, you know, da, da, da --,here's the big idea. And kind of take a much more complex situation,and actually end up making a mess of it. Do you worry about that? 
 RB: Well, first of all, on this particular situation, we're actually --,we're working with the government on it.,I mean, Thabo Mbeki's had his problems with accepting,HIV and AIDS are related, but this is a way, I think,,of him tackling this problem and instead of the world criticizing him,,it's a way of working with him, with his government.,It's important that if people do go to Africa and do try to help,,they don't just go in there and then leave after a few years.,It's got to be consistent.,But I think business leaders can bring their entrepreneurial know-how,and help governments approach things slightly differently.,For instance, we're setting up clinics in Africa,where we're going to be giving,free antiretroviral drugs, free TB treatment,and free malaria treatment.,But we're also trying to make them self-sustaining clinics,,so that people pay for some other aspects. 
 CA: I mean a lot of cynics say about someone like yourself, or Bill Gates,,or whatever, that this is really being -- it's almost driven by,some sort of desire again, you know, for the right image,,for guilt avoidance and not like a real philanthropic instinct.,What would you say to them? 
 RB: Well, I think that everybody --,people do things for a whole variety of different reasons,and I think that, you know, when I'm on me deathbed,,I will want to feel that I've made a difference,to other people's lives.,And that may be a selfish thing to think,,but it's the way I've been brought up.,I think if I'm in a position to,radically change other people's lives for the better,,I should do so. 
 CA: How old are you? 
 RB: I'm 56. 
 CA: I mean, the psychologist Erik Erikson says that -- as I understand him,and I'm a total amateur -- but that during 30s, 40s people are driven by,this desire to grow and that's where they get their fulfillment.,50s, 60s, the mode of operation shifts more to the quest for wisdom,and a search for legacy.,I mean, it seems like you're still,a little bit in the growth phases,,you're still doing these incredible new plans.,How much do you think about legacy,,and what would you like your legacy to be? 
 RB: I don't think I think too much about legacy.,I mean, I like to -- you know, my grandmother lived to 101,,so hopefully I've got another 30 or 40 years to go.,No, I just want to live life to its full.,You know, if I can make a difference,,I hope to be able to make a difference.,And I think one of the positive things at the moment is,you've got Sergey and Larry from Google, for instance,,who are good friends.,And, thank God, you've got two people,who genuinely care about the world and with that kind of wealth.,If they had that kind of wealth and they didn't care about the world,,it would be very worrying.,And you know they're going to make a hell of a difference to the world.,And I think it's important,that people in that kind of position do make a difference. 
 CA: Well, Richard, when I was starting off in business,,I knew nothing about it and I also was sort of --,I thought that business people were supposed to just be ruthless,and that that was the only way you could have a chance of succeeding.,And you actually did inspire me. I looked at you, I thought,,well, he's made it. Maybe there is a different way.,So I would like to thank you for that inspiration,,and for coming to TED today. Thank you.,Thank you so much.,(Applause)This is a recent comic strip from the Los Angeles Times.,The punch line?,"On the other hand, I don't have to get up at four,every single morning to milk my Labrador.",This is a recent cover of New York Magazine.,Best hospitals where doctors say they would go for cancer treatment,,births, strokes, heart disease, hip replacements, 4 a.m. emergencies.,And this is a song medley I put together -- 
 (Music) 
 Did you ever notice that four in the morning has become,some sort of meme or shorthand?,It means something like you are awake at the worst possible hour. 
 (Laughter) 
 A time for inconveniences, mishaps, yearnings.,A time for plotting to whack the chief of police,,like in this classic scene from "The Godfather.",Coppola's script describes these guys as, "exhausted in shirt sleeves.,It is four in the morning." 
 (Laughter) 
 A time for even grimmer stuff than that,,like autopsies and embalmings in Isabel Allende's,"The House of the Spirits.",After the breathtaking green-haired Rosa is murdered,,the doctors preserve her with unguents and morticians' paste.,They worked until four o'clock in the morning. 
 A time for even grimmer stuff than that,,like in last April's New Yorker magazine.,This short fiction piece by Martin Amis,starts out, "On September 11, 2001, he opened his eyes,at 4 a.m. in Portland, Maine,,and Mohamed Atta's last day began.",For a time that I find to be the most placid,and uneventful hour of the day, four in the morning sure gets,an awful lot of bad press -- 
 (Laughter) 
 across a lot of different media from a lot of big names.,And it made me suspicious.,I figured, surely some of the most creative artistic minds in the world, really,,aren't all defaulting back to this one easy trope,like they invented it, right?,Could it be there is something more going on here?,Something deliberate, something secret,,and who got the four in the morning bad rap ball rolling anyway?,I say this guy -- Alberto Giacometti, shown here,with some of his sculptures on the Swiss 100 franc note.,He did it with this famous piece,from the New York Museum of Modern Art.,Its title -- "The Palace at Four in the Morning -- 
 (Laughter) 
 1932.,Not just the earliest cryptic reference,to four in the morning I can find.,I believe that this so-called first surrealist sculpture,may provide an incredible key to virtually,every artistic depiction of four in the morning to follow it.,I call this The Giacometti Code, a TED exclusive.,No, feel free to follow along on your Blackberries,or your iPhones if you've got them. 
 It works a little something like -- this is a recent Google search,for four in the morning.,Results vary, of course. This is pretty typical.,The top 10 results yield you,four hits for Faron Young's song, "It's Four in the Morning,",three hits for Judi Dench's film, "Four in the Morning,",one hit for Wislawa Szymborska's poem, "Four in the Morning.",But what, you may ask, do a Polish poet, a British Dame,,a country music hall of famer all have in common,besides this totally excellent Google ranking? 
 Well, let's start with Faron Young -- who was born incidentally,in 1932. 
 (Laughter) 
 In 1996, he shot himself in the head on December ninth --,which incidentally is Judi Dench's birthday. 
 (Laughter) 
 But he didn't die on Dench's birthday.,He languished until the following afternoon when he finally succumbed,to a supposedly self-inflicted gunshot wound at the age of 64 --,which incidentally is how old Alberto Giacometti was when he died. 
 Where was Wislawa Szymborska during all this?,She has the world's most absolutely watertight alibi.,On that very day, December 10, 1996 while Mr. Four in the Morning,,Faron Young, was giving up the ghost in Nashville, Tennessee,,Ms. Four in the Morning -- or one of them anyway -- Wislawa Szymborska,was in Stockholm, Sweden, accepting the Nobel Prize for Literature.,100 years to the day after the death of Alfred Nobel himself.,Coincidence? No, it's creepy. 
 (Laughter) 
 Coincidence to me has a much simpler metric.,That's like me telling you,,"Hey, you know the Nobel Prize was established in 1901,,which coincidentally is the same year Alberto Giacometti was born?",No, not everything fits so tidily into the paradigm,,but that does not mean there's not something going on,at the highest possible levels.,In fact there are people in this room,who may not want me to show you this clip we're about to see. 
 (Laughter) 
 Video: Homer Simpson: We have a tennis court, a swimming pool, a screening room --,You mean if I want pork chops, even in the middle of the night,,your guy will fry them up? 
 Herbert Powell: Sure, that's what he's paid for.,Now do you need towels, laundry, maids? 
 HS: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait -- let me see if I got this straight.,It is Christmas Day, 4 a.m.,There's a rumble in my stomach. 
 Marge Simpson: Homer, please. 
 Rives: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.,Let me see if I got this straight, Matt. 
 (Laughter) 
 When Homer Simpson needs to imagine,the most remote possible moment of not just the clock,,but the whole freaking calendar, he comes up with 0400,on the birthday of the Baby Jesus.,And no, I don't know how it works,into the whole puzzling scheme of things, but obviously,I know a coded message when I see one. 
 (Laughter) 
 I said, I know a coded message when I see one.,And folks, you can buy a copy of Bill Clinton's "My Life",from the bookstore here at TED.,Parse it cover to cover for whatever hidden references you want.,Or you can go to the Random House website where there is this excerpt.,And how far down into it you figure we'll have to scroll,to get to the golden ticket?,Would you believe about a dozen paragraphs?,This is page 474 on your paperbacks if you're following along:,"Though it was getting better, I still wasn't satisfied,with the inaugural address.,My speechwriters must have been tearing their hair out,because as we worked between one and four in the morning,on Inauguration Day, I was still changing it." 
 Sure you were, because you've prepared your entire life,for this historic quadrennial event that just sort of sneaks up on you.,And then -- 
 (Laughter) 
 three paragraphs later we get this little beauty:,"We went back to Blair House to look at the speech for the last time.,It had gotten a lot better since 4 a.m.",Well, how could it have?,By his own writing, this man was either asleep,,at a prayer meeting with Al and Tipper or learning how to launch,a nuclear missile out of a suitcase.,What happens to American presidents at 0400 on inauguration day?,What happened to William Jefferson Clinton?,We might not ever know.,And I noticed, he's not exactly around here today,to face any tough questions. 
 (Laughter) 
 It could get awkward, right?,I mean after all, this whole business happened on his watch.,But if he were here -- 
 (Laughter) 
 he might remind us, as he does in the wrap-up to his fine autobiography,,that on this day Bill Clinton began a journey --,a journey that saw him go on to become,the first Democrat president elected,to two consecutive terms in decades.,In generations.,The first since this man, Franklin Delano Roosevelt,,who began his own unprecedented journey,way back at his own first election,,way back in a simpler time, way back in 1932 --,(Laughter) 
 the year Alberto Giacometti 
 (Laughter) 
 made "The Palace at Four in the Morning.",The year, let's remember, that this voice, now departed,,first came a-cryin' into this big old crazy world of ours. 
 (Music) 
 (Applause)I'm going to talk about two stories today.,One is how we need to use market-based pricing to affect demand,and use wireless technologies to dramatically reduce our emissions,in the transportation sector.,And the other is that there is an incredible opportunity,if we choose the right wireless technologies;,how we can generate a new engine for economic growth,and dramatically reduce C02 in the other sectors. 
 I'm really scared.,We need to reduce C02 emissions in ten to fifteen years by 80 percent,in order to avert catastrophic effects.,And I am astounded that I'm standing here to tell you that.,What are catastrophic effects? A three degree centigrade climate change rise,that will result in 50 percent species extinction.,It's not a movie. This is real life.,And I'm really worried, because when people talk about cars,-- which I know something about --,the press and politicians and people in this room are all thinking,,"Let's use fuel-efficient cars.",If we started today, 10 years from now, at the end of this window of opportunity,,those fuel-efficient cars will reduce our fossil fuel needs by four percent.,That is not enough. 
 But now I'll talk about some more pleasant things.,Here are some ways that we can make some dramatic changes.,So, Zipcar is a company that I founded seven years ago,,but it's an example of something called car sharing.,What Zipcar does is we park cars throughout dense urban areas,for members to reserve, by the hour and by the day, instead of using their own car.,How does it feel to be a person using a Zipcar?,It means that I pay only for what I need.,All those hours when a car is sitting idle, I'm not paying for it.,It means that I can choose a car exactly for that particular trip.,So, here's a woman that reserved MiniMia, and she had her day.,I can take a BMW when I'm seeing clients.,I can drive my Toyota Element when I'm going to go on that surfing trip. 
 And the other remarkable thing is it's, I think, the highest status of car ownership.,Not only do I have a fleet of cars available to me in seven cities around the world,that I can have at my beck and call,,but heaven forbid I would ever maintain,or deal with the repair or have anything to do with it.,It's like the car that you always wanted that your mom said that you couldn't have.,I get all the good stuff and none of the bad. 
 So, what is the social result of this?,The social result is that today's Zipcar has 100,000 members,driving 3,000 cars parked in 3,000 parking spaces.,Instead of driving 12,000 miles a year, which is what the average city dweller does,,they drive 500 miles a year. Are they happy?,The company has been doubling in size ever since I founded it, or greater.,People adore the company. And it's better,,you know? They like it.,So, how is it that people went from the 12,000 miles a year to 500 miles?,It's because they said, "It's eight to 10 dollars an hour and 65 dollars a day.,If I'm going to go buy some ice cream,,do I really want to spend eight dollars to go buy the ice cream? Or maybe I'll do without.,Maybe I would have bought the ice cream when I did some other errand.",So, people really respond very quickly to it, to prices. 
 And the last point I want to make is Zipcar would never be possible without technology.,It required that it was completely trivial: that it takes 30 seconds,to reserve a car, go get it, drive it.,And for me, as a service provider,,I would never be able to provide you a car for an hour,if the transaction cost was anything.,So, without these wireless technologies, this, as a concept, could never happen. 
 So, here's another example. This company is GoLoco --,I'm launching it in about three weeks --,and I hope to do for ridesharing what I did for car sharing.,This will apply to people across all of America.,Today, 75 percent of the trips are single-occupancy vehicles,,yet 12 percent of trips to work are currently carpool.,And I think that we can apply social networks and online payment systems,to completely change how people feel about ridesharing,and make that trip much more efficient. 
 And so when I think about the future,,people will be thinking that sharing the ride with someone,is this incredibly great social event out of their day.,You know, how did you get to TED? You went with other TEDsters.,How fabulous. Why would you ever want to go by yourself in your own car?,How did you go food shopping? You went with your neighbor, what a great social time.,You know it's going to really transform how we feel about travel,,and it will also, I think, enhance our freedom of mobility.,Where can I go today and who can I do it with?,Those are the types of things that you will look at and feel. 
 And the social benefits:,the rate of single-occupancy vehicles is, I told you, 75 percent;,I think we can get that down to 50 percent.,The demand for parking, of course, is down, congestion and the CO2 emissions.,One last piece about this, of course, is that it's enabled by wireless technologies.,And it's the cost of driving that's making people want to be able to do this.,The average American spends 19 percent of their income on their car,,and there's a pressure for them to reduce that cost, yet they have no outlet today. 
 So, the last example of this is congestion pricing, very famously done in London.,It's when you charge a premium for people to drive on congested roads.,In London, the day they turned the congestion pricing on,,there was a 25 percent decrease in congestion overnight,,and that's persisted for the four years in which they've been doing congestion pricing.,And again, do people like the outcome?,Ken Livingstone was reelected.,So again, we can see that price plays an enormous role in people's willingness,to reduce their driving behavior.,We've tripled the miles that we drive since 1970 and doubled them since 1982.,There's a huge slack in that system;,with the right pricing we can undo that. 
 Congestion pricing is being discussed in every major city around the world,and is, again, wirelessly enabled.,You weren't going to put tollbooths around the city of London,and open and shut those gates.,And what congestion pricing is is that it's a technology trial and a psychological trial,for something called road pricing.,And road pricing is where we're all going to have to go,,because today we pay for our maintenance,and wear and tear on our cars with gas taxes.,And as we get our cars more fuel-efficient,,that's going to be reducing the amount of revenue that you get off of those gas taxes,,so we need to charge people by the mile that they drive.,Whatever happens with congestion pricing and those technologies,will be happening with road pricing. 
 Why do we travel too much?,Car travel is underpriced and therefore we over-consumed.,We need to put this better market feedback.,And if we have it, you'll decide how many miles to drive,,what mode of travel, where to live and work.,And wireless technologies make this real-time loop possible. 
 So, I want to move now to the second part of my story,,which is: when are we going to start doing,this congestion pricing? Road pricing is coming.,When are we going to do it? Are we going to wait,10 to 15 years for this to happen,or are we going to finally have this political will to make it happen in the next two years?,Because I'm going to say, that is going to be the tool that's going to turn our usage overnight. 
 And what kind of wireless technology are we going to use?,This is my big vision.,There is a tool that can help us bridge the digital divide,,respond to emergencies, get traffic moving,,provide a new engine for economic growth,and dramatically reduce CO2 emissions in every sector.,And this is a moment from "The Graduate." Do you remember this moment?,You guys are going to be the handsome young guy,and I'm going to be the wise businessman.,"I want to say one word to you, just one word.","Yes, sir?" "Are you listening?" "Yes I am.","Ad-hoc peer-to-peer self-configuring wireless networks.",(Laughter),These are also called mesh networks.,And in a mesh, every device contributes to and expands the network,,and I think you might have heard a little bit about it before. 
 I'm going to give you some examples.,You'll be hearing later today from Alan Kay.,These laptops, when a child opens them up,,they communicate with every single child in the classroom,,within that school, within that village.,And what is the cost of that communication system?,Zero dollars a month.,Here's another example: in New Orleans,,video cameras were mesh-enabled,so that they could monitor crime in the downtown French Quarter.,When the hurricane happened,,the only communication system standing was the mesh network.,Volunteers flew in, added a whole bunch of devices,,and for the next 12 months,,mesh networks were the only wireless that was happening in New Orleans. 
 Another example is in Portsmouth, U.K.,They mesh-enabled 300 buses and they speak to these smart terminals.,You can look at the terminal,and be able to see precisely where your bus is on the street,and when it's coming, and you can buy your tickets in real time.,Again, all mesh-enabled. Monthly communication cost: zero.,So, the beauty of mesh networks:,you can have these very low-cost devices.,Zero ongoing communication costs. Highly scalable;,you can just keep adding them, and as in Katrina,,you can keep subtracting them -- as long as there's some, we can still communicate.,They're resilient; their redundancy is built into this fabulous decentralized design. 
 What are the incredible weaknesses?,There isn't anybody in Washington lobbying to make it happen --,or in those municipalities, to build out their cities with these wireless networks --,because there's zero ongoing communications cost.,So, the examples that I gave you are these islands of mesh networks,,and networks are interesting only as they are big. 
 How do we create a big network?,Are you guys ready again -- "The Graduate"?,This time you will still play the handsome young thing, but I'll be the sexy woman.,These are the next two lines in the movie.,"Where did you do it?" "In his car.",So you know, when you stick this idea ... (Laughter),where would we expect me, Robin Chase, to be thinking,is imagine if we put a mesh-network device,in every single car across America.,We could have a coast-to-coast, free wireless communication system.,I guess I just want you to think about that. 
 And why is this going to happen? Because we're going to do congestion pricing,,we are going to do road tolls,,gas taxes are going to become road pricing.,These things are going to happen.,What's the wireless technology we're going to use?,Maybe we should use a good one. When are we going to do it?,Maybe we shouldn't wait for the 10 or 15 years for this to happen.,We should pull it forward. 
 So, I'd like us to launch the wireless Internet interstate wireless mesh system,,and require that this network be accessible to everyone, with open standards.,Right now in the transportation sector, we're creating these wireless devices --,I guess you guys might have Fast Pass here or Easy Lane --,that are single-purpose devices in these closed networks.,What is the point?,We're transferring just a few little data bits,when we're doing road controlling, road pricing.,We have this incredible excess capacity.,So, we can provide the lowest-cost means of going wireless coast-to-coast,,we can have resilient nationwide communication systems,,we have a new tool for creating efficiencies in all sectors.,Imagine what happens when the cost of getting information,from anywhere to anywhere is close to zero.,What you can do with that tool: we can create an economic engine.,Information should be free, and access to information should be free,,and we should be charging people for carbon. 
 I think this is a more powerful tool than the Interstate Highway Act,,and I think this is as important and world changing,to our economy as electrification.,And if I had my druthers,,we would have an open-source version in addition to open standards.,And this open-source version means that,it could be -- if we did a brilliant job of it --,it could be used around the world very quickly.,So, going back to one of my earlier thoughts.,Imagine if every one of these buses in Lagos was part of the mesh network.,When I went this morning to Larry Brilliant's TEDTalk prize,-- his fabulous networks --,imagine if there was an open-source,mesh communications device that can be put into those networks,,to make all that happen.,And we can be doing it if we could just get over the fact that,this little slice of things is going to be for free.,We could make billions of dollars on top of it,,but this one particular slice of communications needs to be open source. 
 So, let's take control of this nightmare:,implement a gas tax immediately;,transition across the nation to road-tolling with this wireless mesh;,require that the mesh be open to all, with open standards;,and, of course, use mesh networks.,Thank you. (Applause)What I want to talk to you about today is,virtual worlds, digital globes, the 3-D Web, the Metaverse.,What does this all mean for us?,What it means is the Web is going to become an exciting place again.,It's going to become super exciting as we transform,to this highly immersive and interactive world.,With graphics, computing power, low latencies,,these types of applications and possibilities,are going to stream rich data into your lives.,So the Virtual Earth initiative, and other types of these initiatives,,are all about extending our current search metaphor. 
 When you think about it, we're so constrained by browsing the Web,,remembering URLs, saving favorites.,As we move to search, we rely on the relevance rankings,,the Web matching, the index crawling.,But we want to use our brain!,We want to navigate, explore, discover information.,In order to do that, we have to put you as a user back in the driver's seat.,We need cooperation between you and the computing network and the computer. 
 So what better way to put you back in the driver's seat,than to put you in the real world that you interact in every day?,Why not leverage the learnings that you've been learning your entire life?,So Virtual Earth is about starting off,creating the first digital representation, comprehensive, of the entire world.,What we want to do is mix in all types of data.,Tag it. Attribute it. Metadata. Get the community to add local depth,,global perspective, local knowledge.,So when you think about this problem,,what an enormous undertaking. Where do you begin?,Well, we collect data from satellites, from airplanes,,from ground vehicles, from people.,This process is an engineering problem,,a mechanical problem, a logistical problem, an operational problem. 
 Here is an example of our aerial camera.,This is panchromatic. It's actually four color cones.,In addition, it's multi-spectral.,We collect four gigabits per second of data,,if you can imagine that kind of data stream coming down.,That's equivalent to a constellation of 12 satellites at highest res capacity.,We fly these airplanes at 5,000 feet in the air.,You can see the camera on the front. We collect multiple viewpoints,,vantage points, angles, textures. We bring all that data back in. 
 We sit here -- you know, think about the ground vehicles, the human scale --,what do you see in person? We need to capture that up close,to establish that what it's like-type experience.,I bet many of you have seen the Apple commercials,,kind of poking at the PC for their brilliance and simplicity.,So a little unknown secret is --,did you see the one with the guy, he's got the Web cam?,The poor PC guy. They're duct taping his head. They're just wrapping it on him.,Well, a little unknown secret is his brother actually works on the Virtual Earth team.,(Laughter). So they've got a little bit of a sibling rivalry thing going on here.,But let me tell you -- it doesn't affect his day job. 
 We think a lot of good can come from this technology.,This was after Katrina. We were the first commercial fleet of airplanes,to be cleared into the disaster impact zone.,We flew the area. We imaged it. We sent in people. We took pictures of interiors,,disaster areas. We helped with the first responders, the search and rescue.,Often the first time anyone saw what happened to their house was on Virtual Earth.,We made it all freely available on the Web, just to --,it was obviously our chance of helping out with the cause. 
 When we think about how all this comes together,,it's all about software, algorithms and math.,You know, we capture this imagery but to build the 3-D models,we need to do geo-positioning. We need to do geo-registering of the images.,We have to bundle adjust them. Find tie points.,Extract geometry from the images.,This process is a very calculated process.,In fact, it was always done manual.,Hollywood would spend millions of dollars to do a small urban corridor,for a movie because they'd have to do it manually.,They'd drive the streets with lasers called LIDAR.,They'd collected information with photos. They'd manually build each building.,We do this all through software, algorithms and math --,a highly automated pipeline creating these cities.,We took a decimal point off what it cost to build these cities,,and that's how we're going to be able to scale this out and make this reality a dream. 
 We think about the user interface.,What does it mean to look at it from multiple perspectives?,An ortho-view, a nadir-view. How do you keep the precision of the fidelity of the imagery,while maintaining the fluidity of the model?,I'll wrap up by showing you the --,this is a brand-new peek I haven't really shown into the lab area of Virtual Earth.,What we're doing is -- people like this a lot,,this bird's eye imagery we work with. It's this high resolution data.,But what we've found is they like the fluidity of the 3-D model.,A child can navigate with an Xbox controller or a game controller. 
 So here what we're trying to do is we bring the picture and project it into the 3-D model space.,You can see all types of resolution. From here, I can slowly pan the image over.,I can get the next image. I can blend and transition.,By doing this I don't lose the original detail. In fact, I might be recording history.,The freshness, the capacity. I can turn this image.,I can look at it from multiple viewpoints and angles. 
 What we're trying to do is build a virtual world.,We hope that we can make computing a user model you're familiar with,,and really derive insights from you, from all different directions.,I thank you very much for your time.,(Applause)By day, I'm a venture capitalist.,On weekends, I love rockets.,I love photography, I love rockets.,I'm going to talknabout a hobby that can scale,and show you photosnI've taken over the years,with kids like these, that hopefullynwill grow up to love rocketry,and eventually becomena Richard Branson or Diamandis.,My son designed a rocketnthat became stable, a golf ball rocket.,I thought it was quitenan interesting experiment,in the principles of rocket science.,And it flies straight as an arrow. 
 Baking soda and vinegar.,Night shots are beautiful,,piercing the Big Dipper and the Milky Way.,2-stage rocketsnwith video cameras on them,,onboard computers logging their flights,nrocket gliders that fly back to Earth.,I use RockSim to simulatenflights before they go,to see if they'll break supersonic,,then fly them with onboard computersnto verify performance. 
 To launch the big stuff,nyou go to the middle of nowhere:,Black Rock Desert,nwhere dangerous things happen.,The boys and the rockets get bigger.,They use motorsnused on cruise-missile boosters.,They rumble the belly and leaveneven photographers in awe,,watching the spectacle.,These rockets usenexperimental motors like nitrous oxide.,They use solid propellant most frequently.,It's a strange kind of love. 
 RocketMavericks.com with my photos,nif you want to learn about this,,participate, be a spectator.,We had to call it Rocket Mavericks.,This one was great, went to 100,000 feetn-- but didn't quite.,Actually, it went 11 feet into solid claynand became a bunker-buster.,It had to be dug out. 
 Rockets often spiral out of controlnif you put too much propellant in them.,Here was a drag race.,At night you can seenwhat happened in a second;,in daytime, we call them land sharks.,Sometimes they just explodenbefore your eyes or come down supersonic. 
 (Laughter) 
 To take this shot, I did what I often do,nwhich is go way beyond the pads,,where none of the spectators are.,And if we can run the video,nI'll show you what it took,to get this DreamWorks shot. 
 (Video) Voices: Woo-hoo! Yeah. Nice. 
 Steve Jurvetson: They realize the computernfailed, they're yelling "Deploy!",(Video) Man: Oh, shit. 
 SJ: This is when they realizeneverything's gone haywire. 
 (Video) Man: It's going ballistic. 
 SJ: I'll just be quiet. 
 (Video) Woman: No!,Come on, come on, come on. 
 SJ: And that's me over there,ntaking photos the whole way.,Things often go wrong.,Some people watch thisnbecause of a NASCAR-like fascination,with things bumping and grinding.,Burning the parachute as it fell.nThat was last weekend.,This guy went up, went supersonic,nripped the fin can off.,The art sale in the sky.,A burning metal hunk coming back.,These things droppedndown from above all through the weekend,of rocket launch after rocket launch.,It's a cadence you can't quite imagine.,I try to capture the mishaps;nit's a challenge in photography,when these things take placenin a fraction of a second. 
 Why do it? For things like this:,Gene from Alabama drives out there,with this rocket he's builtnwith X-ray sensors, video cameras,,festooned with electronics.,He succeeds getting to 100,000 feet,,leaving the atmosphere,nseeing a thin blue line of space. 
 It is this breathtaking image --nsuccess, of course -- that motivates us,and motivates kids to follownand understand rocket science,,understand the importancenof physics and math,and, in many ways,nto have that awe at exploration,of the frontiers of the unknown. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Images like this, from the Auschwitz concentration camp,,have been seared into our consciousness during the twentieth century,and have given us a new understanding of who we are,,where we've come from and the times we live in.,During the twentieth century, we witnessed the atrocities,of Stalin, Hitler, Mao, Pol Pot, Rwanda and other genocides,,and even though the twenty-first century is only seven years old,,we have already witnessed an ongoing genocide in Darfur,and the daily horrors of Iraq.,This has led to a common understanding of our situation,,namely that modernity has brought us terrible violence, and perhaps,that native peoples lived in a state of harmony that we have departed from, to our peril. 
 Here is an example,from an op-ed on Thanksgiving, in the Boston Globe,a couple of years ago, where the writer wrote, "The Indian life,was a difficult one, but there were no employment problems,,community harmony was strong, substance abuse unknown,,crime nearly non-existent, what warfare there was between tribes,was largely ritualistic and seldom resulted in indiscriminate,or wholesale slaughter." Now, you're all familiar with this treacle.,We teach it to our children. We hear it on television,and in storybooks. Now, the original title of this session,was, "Everything You Know Is Wrong," and I'm going to present evidence,that this particular part of our common understanding is wrong,,that, in fact, our ancestors were far more violent than we are,,that violence has been in decline for long stretches of time,,and that today we are probably living in the most peaceful time in our species' existence. 
 Now, in the decade of Darfur and Iraq,,a statement like that might seem somewhere between hallucinatory,and obscene. But I'm going to try to convince you,that that is the correct picture. The decline of violence,is a fractal phenomenon. You can see it over millennia,,over centuries, over decades and over years,,although there seems to have been a tipping point at the onset,of the Age of Reason in the sixteenth century. One sees it,all over the world, although not homogeneously.,It's especially evident in the West, beginning with England,and Holland around the time of the Enlightenment. 
 Let me take you on a journey of several powers of 10 --,from the millennium scale to the year scale --,to try to persuade you of this. Until 10,000 years ago, all humans,lived as hunter-gatherers, without permanent settlements,or government. And this is the state that's commonly thought,to be one of primordial harmony. But the archaeologist,Lawrence Keeley, looking at casualty rates,among contemporary hunter-gatherers, which is our best source,of evidence about this way of life, has shown a rather different conclusion. 
 Here is a graph that he put together,showing the percentage of male deaths due to warfare,in a number of foraging, or hunting and gathering societies.,The red bars correspond to the likelihood that a man will die,at the hands of another man, as opposed to passing away,of natural causes, in a variety of foraging societies,in the New Guinea Highlands and the Amazon Rainforest.,And they range from a rate of almost a 60 percent chance that a man will die,at the hands of another man to, in the case of the Gebusi,,only a 15 percent chance. The tiny, little blue bar in the lower,left-hand corner plots the corresponding statistic from United States,and Europe in the twentieth century, and includes all the deaths,of both World Wars. If the death rate in tribal warfare had prevailed,during the 20th century, there would have been two billion deaths rather than 100 million. 
 Also at the millennium scale, we can look,at the way of life of early civilizations such as the ones described,in the Bible. And in this supposed source of our moral values,,one can read descriptions of what was expected in warfare,,such as the following from Numbers 31: "And they warred,against the Midianites as the Lord commanded Moses,,and they slew all the males. And Moses said unto them,,'Have you saved all the women alive? Now, therefore, kill every male,among the little ones and kill every woman that hath known man,by lying with him, but all the women children that have not know a man,by lying with him keep alive for yourselves.'" In other words,,kill the men; kill the children; if you see any virgins,,then you can keep them alive so that you can rape them.,You can find four or five passages in the Bible of this ilk.,Also in the Bible, one sees that the death penalty,was the accepted punishment for crimes such as homosexuality,,adultery, blasphemy, idolatry, talking back to your parents --,(Laughter) -- and picking up sticks on the Sabbath.,Well, let's click the zoom lens,down one order of magnitude, and look at the century scale.,Although we don't have statistics for warfare throughout,the Middle Ages to modern times,,we know just from conventional history -- the evidence,was under our nose all along that there has been a reduction,in socially sanctioned forms of violence. 
 For example, any social history will reveal that mutilation and torture,were routine forms of criminal punishment. The kind of infraction,today that would give you a fine, in those days would result in,your tongue being cut out, your ears being cut off, you being blinded,,a hand being chopped off and so on.,There were numerous ingenious forms of sadistic capital punishment:,burning at the stake, disemboweling, breaking on the wheel,,being pulled apart by horses and so on.,The death penalty was a sanction for a long list of non-violent crimes:,criticizing the king, stealing a loaf of bread. Slavery, of course,,was the preferred labor-saving device, and cruelty was,a popular form of entertainment. Perhaps the most vivid example,was the practice of cat burning, in which a cat was hoisted,on a stage and lowered in a sling into a fire,,and the spectators shrieked in laughter as the cat, howling in pain,,was burned to death. 
 What about one-on-one murder? Well, there, there are good statistics,,because many municipalities recorded the cause of death.,The criminologist Manuel Eisner,scoured all of the historical records across Europe,for homicide rates in any village, hamlet, town, county,that he could find, and he supplemented them,with national data, when nations started keeping statistics.,He plotted on a logarithmic scale, going from 100 deaths,per 100,000 people per year, which was approximately the rate,of homicide in the Middle Ages. And the figure plummets down,to less than one homicide per 100,000 people per year,in seven or eight European countries. Then, there is a slight uptick,in the 1960s. The people who said that rock 'n' roll would lead,to the decline of moral values actually had a grain of truth to that.,But there was a decline from at least two orders of magnitude,in homicide from the Middle Ages to the present,,and the elbow occurred in the early sixteenth century. 
 Let's click down now to the decade scale.,According to non-governmental organizations,that keep such statistics, since 1945, in Europe and the Americas,,there has been a steep decline in interstate wars,,in deadly ethnic riots or pogroms, and in military coups,,even in South America. Worldwide, there's been a steep decline,in deaths in interstate wars. The yellow bars here show the number,of deaths per war per year from 1950 to the present.,And, as you can see, the death rate goes down from 65,000 deaths,per conflict per year in the 1950s to less than 2,000 deaths,per conflict per year in this decade, as horrific as it is.,Even in the year scale, one can see a decline of violence.,Since the end of the Cold War, there have been fewer civil wars,,fewer genocides -- indeed, a 90 percent reduction since post-World War II highs --,and even a reversal of the 1960s uptick in homicide and violent crime.,This is from the FBI Uniform Crime Statistics. You can see,that there is a fairly low rate of violence in the '50s and the '60s,,then it soared upward for several decades, and began,a precipitous decline, starting in the 1990s, so that it went back,to the level that was last enjoyed in 1960.,President Clinton, if you're here, thank you.,(Laughter) 
 So the question is, why are so many people so wrong,about something so important? I think there are a number of reasons.,One of them is we have better reporting. The Associated Press,is a better chronicler of wars over the surface of the Earth,than sixteenth-century monks were.,There's a cognitive illusion. We cognitive psychologists know that the easier it is,to recall specific instances of something,,the higher the probability that you assign to it.,Things that we read about in the paper with gory footage,burn into memory more than reports of a lot more people dying,in their beds of old age. There are dynamics in the opinion,and advocacy markets: no one ever attracted observers, advocates,and donors by saying,things just seem to be getting better and better.,(Laughter) 
 There's guilt about our treatment of native peoples,in modern intellectual life, and an unwillingness to acknowledge,there could be anything good about Western culture.,And of course, our change in standards can outpace the change,in behavior. One of the reasons violence went down,is that people got sick of the carnage and cruelty in their time.,That's a process that seems to be continuing,,but if it outstrips behavior by the standards of the day,,things always look more barbaric than they would have been,by historic standards. So today, we get exercised -- and rightly so --,if a handful of murderers get executed by lethal injection,in Texas after a 15-year appeal process. We don't consider,that a couple of hundred years ago, they may have been burned,at the stake for criticizing the king after a trial,that lasted 10 minutes, and indeed, that that would have been repeated,over and over again. Today, we look at capital punishment,as evidence of how low our behavior can sink,,rather than how high our standards have risen. 
 Well, why has violence declined? No one really knows,,but I have read four explanations, all of which, I think,,have some grain of plausibility. The first is, maybe,Thomas Hobbes got it right. He was the one who said,that life in a state of nature was "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish,and short." Not because, he argued,,humans have some primordial thirst for blood,or aggressive instinct or territorial imperative,,but because of the logic of anarchy. In a state of anarchy,,there's a constant temptation to invade your neighbors preemptively,,before they invade you. More recently, Thomas Schelling,gives the analogy of a homeowner who hears a rustling,in the basement. Being a good American, he has a pistol,in the nightstand, pulls out his gun, and walks down the stairs.,And what does he see but a burglar with a gun in his hand.,Now, each one of them is thinking,,"I don't really want to kill that guy, but he's about to kill me.,Maybe I had better shoot him, before he shoots me,,especially since, even if he doesn't want to kill me,,he's probably worrying right now that I might kill him,before he kills me." And so on.,Hunter-gatherer peoples explicitly go through this train of thought,,and will often raid their neighbors out of fear of being raided first. 
 Now, one way of dealing with this problem is by deterrence.,You don't strike first, but you have a publicly announced policy,that you will retaliate savagely if you are invaded.,The only thing is that it's,liable to having its bluff called, and therefore can only work,if it's credible. To make it credible, you must avenge all insults,and settle all scores, which leads to the cycles of bloody vendetta.,Life becomes an episode of "The Sopranos." Hobbes' solution,,the "Leviathan," was that if authority for the legitimate use,of violence was vested in a single democratic agency -- a leviathan --,then such a state can reduce the temptation of attack,,because any kind of aggression will be punished,,leaving its profitability as zero. That would remove the temptation,to invade preemptively, out of fear of them attacking you first.,It removes the need for a hair trigger for retaliation,to make your deterrent threat credible. And therefore, it would lead,to a state of peace. Eisner -- the man who plotted the homicide rates,that you failed to see in the earlier slide --,argued that the timing of the decline of homicide in Europe,coincided with the rise of centralized states.,So that's a bit of a support for the leviathan theory.,Also supporting it is the fact that we today see eruptions of violence,in zones of anarchy, in failed states, collapsed empires,,frontier regions, mafias, street gangs and so on. 
 The second explanation is that in many times and places,,there is a widespread sentiment that life is cheap.,In earlier times, when suffering and early death were common,in one's own life, one has fewer compunctions about inflicting them,on others. And as technology and economic efficiency make life,longer and more pleasant, one puts a higher value on life in general.,This was an argument from the political scientist James Payne. 
 A third explanation invokes the concept of a nonzero-sum game,,and was worked out in the book "Nonzero" by the journalist,Robert Wright. Wright points out that in certain circumstances,,cooperation or non-violence can benefit both parties,in an interaction, such as gains in trade when two parties trade,their surpluses and both come out ahead, or when two parties,lay down their arms and split the so-called peace dividend,that results in them not having to fight the whole time.,Wright argues that technology has increased the number,of positive-sum games that humans tend to be embroiled in,,by allowing the trade of goods, services and ideas,over longer distances and among larger groups of people.,The result is that other people become more valuable alive than dead,,and violence declines for selfish reasons. As Wright put it,,"Among the many reasons that I think that we should not bomb,the Japanese is that they built my mini-van.",(Laughter) 
 The fourth explanation is captured in the title of a book,called "The Expanding Circle," by the philosopher Peter Singer,,who argues that evolution bequeathed humans with a sense,of empathy, an ability to treat other peoples' interests,as comparable to one's own. Unfortunately, by default,we apply it only to a very narrow circle of friends and family.,People outside that circle are treated as sub-human,,and can be exploited with impunity. But, over history,,the circle has expanded. One can see, in historical record,,it expanding from the village, to the clan, to the tribe,,to the nation, to other races, to both sexes,,and, in Singer's own arguments, something that we should extend,to other sentient species. The question is,,if this has happened, what has powered that expansion? 
 And there are a number of possibilities, such as increasing circles,of reciprocity in the sense that Robert Wright argues for.,The logic of the golden rule -- the more you think about and interact,with other people, the more you realize that it is untenable,to privilege your interests over theirs,,at least not if you want them to listen to you. You can't say,that my interests are special compared to yours,,anymore than you can say that the particular spot,that I'm standing on is a unique part of the universe,because I happen to be standing on it that very minute.,It may also be powered by cosmopolitanism, by histories,,and journalism, and memoirs, and realistic fiction, and travel,,and literacy, which allows you to project yourself into the lives,of other people that formerly you may have treated as sub-human,,and also to realize the accidental contingency of your own station,in life, the sense that "there but for fortune go I." 
 Whatever its causes, the decline of violence, I think,,has profound implications. It should force us to ask not just, why,is there war? But also, why is there peace? Not just,,what are we doing wrong? But also, what have we been doing right?,Because we have been doing something right,,and it sure would be good to find out what it is.,Thank you very much.,(Applause). 
 Chris Anderson: I loved that talk. I think a lot of people here in the room would say,that that expansion of -- that you were talking about,,that Peter Singer talks about, is also driven by, just by technology,,by greater visibility of the other, and the sense that the world,is therefore getting smaller. I mean, is that also a grain of truth? 
 Steven Pinker: Very much. It would fit both in Wright's theory,,that it allows us to enjoy the benefits of cooperation,over larger and larger circles. But also, I think it helps us,imagine what it's like to be someone else. I think when you read,these horrific tortures that were common in the Middle Ages, you think,,how could they possibly have done it,,how could they have not have empathized with the person,that they're disemboweling? But clearly,,as far as they're concerned, this is just an alien being,that does not have feelings akin to their own. Anything, I think,,that makes it easier to imagine trading places,with someone else means that it increases your moral consideration,to that other person. 
 CA: Well, Steve, I would love every news media owner to hear that talk,at some point in the next year. I think it's really important. Thank you so much.

 Sweeney: Okay. Oprah was never necessarily a big hero of mine.,I mean, I watch Oprah mostly when I'm home in Spokane,visiting my mother.

I call it the Soon-Yi moment:,it is the moment when I cannot continue supporting someone.,And that was that she did two entire shows,promoting that movie "The Secret.",Do you guys know about that movie "The Secret"?,It makes "What the Bleep Do We Know" seem like a doctoral dissertation,from Harvard on quantum mechanics -- that's how bad it is.,It makes "The DaVinci Code" seem like "War and Peace.",That movie is so horrible. It promotes such awful pseudoscience.,And the basic idea is,that there's this law of attraction, and,your thoughts have this vibrating energy,that goes out into the universe,and then you attract good things to happen to you.,On a scientific basis, it's more than just "Power of Positive Thinking" --,it has a horrible, horrible dark side. Like if you get ill,,it's because you've just been thinking negative thoughts.,Yeah, stuff like that was in the movie and she's promoting it.,And all I'm saying is that I really wish that Murray Gell-Mann,would go on Oprah,and just explain to her that the law of attraction is, in fact, not a law.,So that's what I have to say.,(Laughter)

 (Applause)I would like to tell you about a projectnwhich I started about 16 years ago.,It's about making new forms of life.,And these are made of this kind of tube --,electricity tube, we call it in Holland.,And we can start a film about that,,and we can see a little bitnbackwards in time. 
 (Video) Narrator: Eventually, these beastsnare going to live in herds on the beaches.,Theo Jansen is working hardnon this evolution. 
 Theo Jansen: I want to putnthese forms of life on the beaches.,And they should survive over there,,on their own, in the future.,Learning to live on their own --,and it'll take couple of more years,to let them walk on their own. 
 Narrator: The mechanical beastsnwill not get their energy from food,,but from the wind.,The wind will move feathers on their back,nwhich will drive their feet.,The beast walks sidewaysnon the wet sand of the beach,,with its nose pointed into the wind.,As soon as it walks intoneither the rolling surf or the dry sand,,it stops, and walksnin the opposite direction. 
 Evolution has generated many species. 
 (Music) 
 This is the Animaris Currens Ventosa. 
 (Music) 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 TJ: This is a herd, and it is builtnaccording to genetic codes.,And it is a sort of race,nand each and every animal is different,,and the winning codes will multiply. 
 This is the wave,ngoing from left to right.,You can see this one.,Yes, and now it goes from left to right.,This is a new generation, a new family,,which is able to store the wind.,So, the wings pump up airnin lemonade bottles,,which are on top of that.,And they can use that energynin case the wind falls away,,and the tide is coming up,,and there is still a little bit of energynto reach the dunes and save their lives,,because they are drowned very easily. 
 (Laughter) 
 I could show you this animal. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 So, the proportion of the tubes in thisnanimal is very important for the walking.,There are 11 numbers,nwhich I call The 11 Holy Numbers.,These are the distances of the tubesnwhich make it walk that way.,In fact, it's a newninvention of the wheel.,It works the same as a wheel.,The axis of a wheelnstays on the same level,,and this hip is stayingnon the same level as well.,In fact, this is better than a wheel,,because when you try to drivenyour bicycle on the beach,,you will notice it's very hard to do.,And the feet just step over the sand,,and the wheel has to touch every piecenof the ground in-between.,So 5,000 years afternthe invention of the wheel,,we have a new wheel.,I will show you, in the next video --,can you start it, please? --,that very heavy loads can be moved.,There's a guy pushing there, behind,,but it can also walknon the wind very well.,It's 3.2 tons. 
 This is working on the storednwind in the bottles.,It has a feeler, where it cannfeel obstacles and turn around.,You see, it's going the other way. 
 Can I have the feeler here?,OK. Good.,So, they have to survivenall the dangers of the beach,,and one of the big dangers is the sea.,This is the sea.,And it must feel the water of the sea.,And this is the water feeler,,and what's very important is this tube.,It sucks in air normally,,but when it swallows water,nit feels the resistance of it.,So, imagine that the animalnis walking towards the sea.,As soon as it touches the water --,you should hear a sound of running air. 
 (Sound of running air) 
 Yes!,So if it doesn't feel,nit will be drowned, OK? 
 Here we have the brain of the animal.,In fact, it is a step counter,nand it counts the steps.,It's a binary step counter.,So as soon it has been to the sea,,it changes the patternnof zeroes and ones here.,And it always knowsnwhere it is on the beach.,So it's very simple brain.,It says, well, there's the sea,nthere are dunes, and I'm here.,So it's a sort of imaginationnof the simple world of the beach animal. 
 Thank you. 
 One of the biggest enemies are the storms.,This is a part of the nosenof the Animaris Percipiere.,When the nose of the animalnis fixed, the whole animal is fixed.,So when the storm is coming up,,it drives a pin into the ground. 
 (Laughter) 
 Audience member: Wow! 
 The nose is fixed,nthe whole animal is fixed.,The wind may turn, but the animalnwill always turn its nose into the wind.,Now, another couple of years, and thesenanimals will survive on their own.,I still have to help them a lot. 
 Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.

 I am wearing the Al Gore in-ear monitors,he wore on the Larry King show,and I'm hearing that transmission and not mine.,But I guess that's in keeping,,so now we'll just move to the PowerPoint presentation,,ladies and gentlemen. 
 This is a brand new song.,In the spirit of TED, we're bringing you something,that has not been released.,John, do you want to introduce the song?,This is a song about a creature called a hummingbird moth,which imitates another creature,which imitates yet another creature.,It's completely fucked up,and can only be explained in song.

 So we are past our 1,000th show.,Probably somewhere around 1,500.,It's hard to know.,We've only done two shows in 2007 so far,,but our first show,was actually the coldest performance we've ever had.,It was 19 degrees in St. Louis about a month ago,and I'm happy to report,that this performance you are seeing today,is the earliest we have ever performed.,So thank you.,We are cultural test pilots, ladies and gentlemen.,How early can a rock performance begin?,Not all the facts are in about performing,at 8.30 in the morning.,I can tell you the 19 degree thing,was fantastic.,All right. 
 So we don't know that much,about the history of violinists,but we do know that when we entered,the state of New Jersey,there is an uptick in violence.,This song is called "Asbury Park.",It's based on a real life experience.

 Thank you so much.,You've been a wonderful 8:30 audience.,Have a great session.,Thank you all.Well, as Chris pointed out, I study the human brain,,the functions and structure of the human brain.,And I just want you to think for a minute about what this entails.,Here is this mass of jelly, three-pound mass of jelly,you can hold in the palm of your hand,,and it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space.,It can contemplate the meaning of infinity,and it can contemplate itself contemplating on the meaning of infinity.,And this peculiar recursive quality that we call self-awareness,,which I think is the holy grail of neuroscience, of neurology,,and hopefully, someday, we'll understand how that happens. 
 OK, so how do you study this mysterious organ?,I mean, you have 100 billion nerve cells,,little wisps of protoplasm, interacting with each other,,and from this activity emerges the whole spectrum of abilities,that we call human nature and human consciousness.,How does this happen?,Well, there are many ways of approaching the functions of the human brain.,One approach, the one we use mainly,,is to look at patients with sustained damage to a small region of the brain,,where there's been a genetic change in a small region of the brain.,What then happens is not an across-the-board reduction,in all your mental capacities,,a sort of blunting of your cognitive ability.,What you get is a highly selective loss of one function,,with other functions being preserved intact,,and this gives you some confidence in asserting,that that part of the brain is somehow involved in mediating that function.,So you can then map function onto structure,,and then find out what the circuitry's doing,to generate that particular function.,So that's what we're trying to do. 
 So let me give you a few striking examples of this.,In fact, I'm giving you three examples, six minutes each, during this talk.,The first example is an extraordinary syndrome called Capgras syndrome.,If you look at the first slide there,,that's the temporal lobes, frontal lobes, parietal lobes, OK --,the lobes that constitute the brain.,And if you look, tucked away inside the inner surface of the temporal lobes --,you can't see it there --,is a little structure called the fusiform gyrus.,And that's been called the face area in the brain,,because when it's damaged, you can no longer recognize people's faces.,You can still recognize them from their voice,and say, "Oh yeah, that's Joe,",but you can't look at their face and know who it is, right?,You can't even recognize yourself in the mirror.,I mean, you know it's you because you wink and it winks,,and you know it's a mirror,,but you don't really recognize yourself as yourself. 
 OK. Now that syndrome is well known as caused by damage to the fusiform gyrus.,But there's another rare syndrome, so rare, in fact,,that very few physicians have heard about it, not even neurologists.,This is called the Capgras delusion,,and that is a patient, who's otherwise completely normal,,has had a head injury, comes out of coma,,otherwise completely normal, he looks at his mother,and says, "This looks exactly like my mother, this woman,,but she's an impostor.,She's some other woman pretending to be my mother.",Now, why does this happen?,Why would somebody -- and this person is perfectly lucid and intelligent,in all other respects, but when he sees his mother,,his delusion kicks in and says, it's not mother. 
 Now, the most common interpretation of this,,which you find in all the psychiatry textbooks,,is a Freudian view, and that is that this chap --,and the same argument applies to women, by the way,,but I'll just talk about guys.,When you're a little baby, a young baby,,you had a strong sexual attraction to your mother.,This is the so-called Oedipus complex of Freud.,I'm not saying I believe this,,but this is the standard Freudian view.,And then, as you grow up, the cortex develops,,and inhibits these latent sexual urges towards your mother.,Thank God, or you would all be sexually aroused when you saw your mother.,And then what happens is,,there's a blow to your head, damaging the cortex,,allowing these latent sexual urges to emerge,,flaming to the surface, and suddenly and inexplicably,you find yourself being sexually aroused by your mother.,And you say, "My God, if this is my mom,,how come I'm being sexually turned on?,She's some other woman. She's an impostor.",It's the only interpretation that makes sense to your damaged brain. 
 This has never made much sense to me, this argument.,It's very ingenious, as all Freudian arguments are --,(Laughter),-- but didn't make much sense because I have seen the same delusion,,a patient having the same delusion, about his pet poodle.,(Laughter),He'll say, "Doctor, this is not Fifi. It looks exactly like Fifi,,but it's some other dog." Right?,Now, you try using the Freudian explanation there.,(Laughter),You'll start talking about the latent bestiality in all humans,,or some such thing, which is quite absurd, of course. 
 Now, what's really going on?,So, to explain this curious disorder,,we look at the structure and functions of the normal visual pathways in the brain.,Normally, visual signals come in, into the eyeballs,,go to the visual areas in the brain.,There are, in fact, 30 areas in the back of your brain concerned with just vision,,and after processing all that, the message goes to a small structure,called the fusiform gyrus, where you perceive faces.,There are neurons there that are sensitive to faces.,You can call it the face area of the brain, right?,I talked about that earlier.,Now, when that area's damaged, you lose the ability to see faces, right? 
 But from that area, the message cascades,into a structure called the amygdala in the limbic system,,the emotional core of the brain,,and that structure, called the amygdala,,gauges the emotional significance of what you're looking at.,Is it prey? Is it predator? Is it mate?,Or is it something absolutely trivial, like a piece of lint,,or a piece of chalk, or a -- I don't want to point to that, but --,or a shoe, or something like that? OK?,Which you can completely ignore.,So if the amygdala is excited, and this is something important,,the messages then cascade into the autonomic nervous system.,Your heart starts beating faster.,You start sweating to dissipate the heat that you're going to,create from muscular exertion.,And that's fortunate, because we can put two electrodes on your palm,and measure the change in skin resistance produced by sweating.,So I can determine, when you're looking at something,,whether you're excited or whether you're aroused, or not, OK?,And I'll get to that in a minute. 
 So my idea was, when this chap looks at an object, when he looks at his --,any object for that matter, it goes to the visual areas and,,however, and it's processed in the fusiform gyrus,,and you recognize it as a pea plant, or a table,,or your mother, for that matter, OK?,And then the message cascades into the amygdala,,and then goes down the autonomic nervous system.,But maybe, in this chap, that wire that goes from the amygdala to the limbic system,,the emotional core of the brain, is cut by the accident.,So because the fusiform is intact,,the chap can still recognize his mother,,and says, "Oh yeah, this looks like my mother.",But because the wire is cut to the emotional centers,,he says, "But how come, if it's my mother, I don't experience a warmth?",Or terror, as the case may be? Right?,(Laughter),And therefore, he says, "How do I account for this inexplicable lack of emotions?,This can't be my mother.,It's some strange woman pretending to be my mother." 
 How do you test this?,Well, what you do is, if you take any one of you here, and put you in front of a screen,,and measure your galvanic skin response,,and show pictures on the screen,,I can measure how you sweat when you see an object,,like a table or an umbrella. Of course, you don't sweat.,If I show you a picture of a lion, or a tiger, or a pinup, you start sweating, right?,And, believe it or not, if I show you a picture of your mother --,I'm talking about normal people -- you start sweating.,You don't even have to be Jewish.,(Laughter) 
 Now, what happens if you show this patient?,You take the patient and show him pictures on the screen,and measure his galvanic skin response.,Tables and chairs and lint, nothing happens, as in normal people,,but when you show him a picture of his mother,,the galvanic skin response is flat.,There's no emotional reaction to his mother,,because that wire going from the visual areas to the emotional centers is cut.,So his vision is normal because the visual areas are normal,,his emotions are normal -- he'll laugh, he'll cry, so on and so forth --,but the wire from vision to emotions is cut,and therefore he has this delusion that his mother is an impostor.,It's a lovely example of the sort of thing we do:,take a bizarre, seemingly incomprehensible, neural psychiatric syndrome,and say that the standard Freudian view is wrong,,that, in fact, you can come up with a precise explanation,in terms of the known neural anatomy of the brain. 
 By the way, if this patient then goes,,and mother phones from an adjacent room -- phones him --,and he picks up the phone, and he says, "Wow, mom, how are you? Where are you?",There's no delusion through the phone.,Then, she approaches him after an hour, he says, "Who are you?,You look just like my mother." OK?,The reason is there's a separate pathway,going from the hearing centers in the brain to the emotional centers,,and that's not been cut by the accident.,So this explains why through the phone he recognizes his mother, no problem.,When he sees her in person, he says it's an impostor. 
 OK, how is all this complex circuitry set up in the brain?,Is it nature, genes, or is it nurture?,And we approach this problem,by considering another curious syndrome called phantom limb.,And you all know what a phantom limb is.,When an arm is amputated, or a leg is amputated, for gangrene,,or you lose it in war -- for example, in the Iraq war,,it's now a serious problem --,you continue to vividly feel the presence of that missing arm,,and that's called a phantom arm or a phantom leg.,In fact, you can get a phantom with almost any part of the body.,Believe it or not, even with internal viscera.,I've had patients with the uterus removed -- hysterectomy --,who have a phantom uterus, including phantom menstrual cramps,at the appropriate time of the month.,And in fact, one student asked me the other day,,"Do they get phantom PMS?",(Laughter),A subject ripe for scientific enquiry, but we haven't pursued that. 
 OK, now the next question is,,what can you learn about phantom limbs by doing experiments?,One of the things we've found was,,about half the patients with phantom limbs,claim that they can move the phantom.,It'll pat his brother on the shoulder,,it'll answer the phone when it rings, it'll wave goodbye.,These are very compelling, vivid sensations.,The patient's not delusional.,He knows that the arm is not there,,but, nevertheless, it's a compelling sensory experience for the patient.,But however, about half the patients, this doesn't happen.,The phantom limb -- they'll say, "But doctor, the phantom limb is paralyzed.,It's fixed in a clenched spasm and it's excruciatingly painful.,If only I could move it, maybe the pain will be relieved." 
 Now, why would a phantom limb be paralyzed?,It sounds like an oxymoron.,But when we were looking at the case sheets, what we found was,,these people with the paralyzed phantom limbs,,the original arm was paralyzed because of the peripheral nerve injury.,The actual nerve supplying the arm was severed,,was cut, by say, a motorcycle accident.,So the patient had an actual arm, which is painful,,in a sling for a few months or a year, and then,,in a misguided attempt to get rid of the pain in the arm,,the surgeon amputates the arm,,and then you get a phantom arm with the same pains, right?,And this is a serious clinical problem.,Patients become depressed.,Some of them are driven to suicide, OK? 
 So, how do you treat this syndrome?,Now, why do you get a paralyzed phantom limb?,When I looked at the case sheet, I found that they had an actual arm,,and the nerves supplying the arm had been cut,,and the actual arm had been paralyzed,,and lying in a sling for several months before the amputation,,and this pain then gets carried over into the phantom itself. 
 Why does this happen?,When the arm was intact, but paralyzed,,the brain sends commands to the arm, the front of the brain, saying, "Move,",but it's getting visual feedback saying, "No.",Move. No. Move. No. Move. No.,And this gets wired into the circuitry of the brain,,and we call this learned paralysis, OK?,The brain learns, because of this Hebbian, associative link,,that the mere command to move the arm,creates a sensation of a paralyzed arm.,And then, when you've amputated the arm,,this learned paralysis carries over into your body image,and into your phantom, OK? 
 Now, how do you help these patients?,How do you unlearn the learned paralysis,,so you can relieve him of this excruciating, clenching spasm,of the phantom arm?,Well, we said, what if you now send the command to the phantom,,but give him visual feedback that it's obeying his command, right?,Maybe you can relieve the phantom pain, the phantom cramp.,How do you do that? Well, virtual reality.,But that costs millions of dollars.,So, I hit on a way of doing this for three dollars,,but don't tell my funding agencies.,(Laughter) 
 OK? What you do is you create what I call a mirror box.,You have a cardboard box with a mirror in the middle,,and then you put the phantom -- so my first patient, Derek, came in.,He had his arm amputated 10 years ago.,He had a brachial avulsion, so the nerves were cut,and the arm was paralyzed, lying in a sling for a year, and then the arm was amputated.,He had a phantom arm, excruciatingly painful, and he couldn't move it.,It was a paralyzed phantom arm. 
 So he came there, and I gave him a mirror like that, in a box,,which I call a mirror box, right?,And the patient puts his phantom left arm,,which is clenched and in spasm, on the left side of the mirror,,and the normal hand on the right side of the mirror,,and makes the same posture, the clenched posture,,and looks inside the mirror. And what does he experience?,He looks at the phantom being resurrected,,because he's looking at the reflection of the normal arm in the mirror,,and it looks like this phantom has been resurrected.,"Now," I said, "now, look, wiggle your phantom --,your real fingers, or move your real fingers while looking in the mirror.",He's going to get the visual impression that the phantom is moving, right?,That's obvious, but the astonishing thing is,,the patient then says, "Oh my God, my phantom is moving again,,and the pain, the clenching spasm, is relieved." 
 And remember, my first patient who came in --,(Applause),-- thank you. (Applause),My first patient came in, and he looked in the mirror,,and I said, "Look at your reflection of your phantom.",And he started giggling, he says, "I can see my phantom.",But he's not stupid. He knows it's not real.,He knows it's a mirror reflection,,but it's a vivid sensory experience.,Now, I said, "Move your normal hand and phantom.",He said, "Oh, I can't move my phantom. You know that. It's painful.",I said, "Move your normal hand.",And he says, "Oh my God, my phantom is moving again. I don't believe this!,And my pain is being relieved." OK?,And then I said, "Close your eyes.",He closes his eyes.,"And move your normal hand.","Oh, nothing. It's clenched again.","OK, open your eyes.","Oh my God, oh my God, it's moving again!",So, he was like a kid in a candy store. 
 So, I said, OK, this proves my theory about learned paralysis,and the critical role of visual input,,but I'm not going to get a Nobel Prize,for getting somebody to move his phantom limb.,(Laughter),(Applause),It's a completely useless ability, if you think about it.,(Laughter),But then I started realizing, maybe other kinds of paralysis,that you see in neurology, like stroke, focal dystonias --,there may be a learned component to this,,which you can overcome with the simple device of using a mirror. 
 So, I said, "Look, Derek" --,well, first of all, the guy can't just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain --,I said, "Look, Derek, take it home and practice with it for a week or two.,Maybe, after a period of practice,,you can dispense with the mirror, unlearn the paralysis,,and start moving your paralyzed arm,,and then, relieve yourself of pain.",So he said OK, and he took it home.,I said, "Look, it's, after all, two dollars. Take it home." 
 So, he took it home, and after two weeks, he phones me,,and he said, "Doctor, you're not going to believe this.",I said, "What?",He said, "It's gone.",I said, "What's gone?",I thought maybe the mirror box was gone.,(Laughter),He said, "No, no, no, you know this phantom I've had for the last 10 years?,It's disappeared.",And I said -- I got worried, I said, my God,,I mean I've changed this guy's body image,,what about human subjects, ethics and all of that?,And I said, "Derek, does this bother you?",He said, "No, last three days, I've not had a phantom arm,and therefore no phantom elbow pain, no clenching,,no phantom forearm pain, all those pains are gone away.,But the problem is I still have my phantom fingers dangling from the shoulder,,and your box doesn't reach.",(Laughter),"So, can you change the design and put it on my forehead,,so I can, you know, do this and eliminate my phantom fingers?",He thought I was some kind of magician. 
 Now, why does this happen?,It's because the brain is faced with tremendous sensory conflict.,It's getting messages from vision saying the phantom is back.,On the other hand, there's no proprioception,,muscle signals saying that there is no arm, right?,And your motor command saying there is an arm,,and, because of this conflict, the brain says, to hell with it,,there is no phantom, there is no arm, right?,It goes into a sort of denial -- it gates the signals.,And when the arm disappears, the bonus is, the pain disappears,because you can't have disembodied pain floating out there, in space.,So, that's the bonus. 
 Now, this technique has been tried on dozens of patients,by other groups in Helsinki,,so it may prove to be valuable as a treatment for phantom pain,,and indeed, people have tried it for stroke rehabilitation.,Stroke you normally think of as damage to the fibers,,nothing you can do about it.,But, it turns out some component of stroke paralysis is also learned paralysis,,and maybe that component can be overcome using mirrors.,This has also gone through clinical trials,,helping lots and lots of patients. 
 OK, let me switch gears now to the third part of my talk,,which is about another curious phenomenon called synesthesia.,This was discovered by Francis Galton in the nineteenth century.,He was a cousin of Charles Darwin.,He pointed out that certain people in the population,,who are otherwise completely normal, had the following peculiarity:,every time they see a number, it's colored.,Five is blue, seven is yellow, eight is chartreuse,,nine is indigo, OK?,Bear in mind, these people are completely normal in other respects.,Or C sharp -- sometimes, tones evoke color.,C sharp is blue, F sharp is green,,another tone might be yellow, right? 
 Why does this happen?,This is called synesthesia. Galton called it synesthesia,,a mingling of the senses.,In us, all the senses are distinct.,These people muddle up their senses.,Why does this happen?,One of the two aspects of this problem are very intriguing.,Synesthesia runs in families,,so Galton said this is a hereditary basis, a genetic basis.,Secondly, synesthesia is about -- and this is what gets me to my point,about the main theme of this lecture, which is about creativity --,synesthesia is eight times more common among artists, poets, novelists,and other creative people than in the general population.,Why would that be?,I'm going to answer that question.,It's never been answered before. 
 OK, what is synesthesia? What causes it?,Well, there are many theories.,One theory is they're just crazy.,Now, that's not really a scientific theory, so we can forget about it.,Another theory is they are acid junkies and potheads, right?,Now, there may be some truth to this,,because it's much more common here in the Bay Area than in San Diego.,(Laughter),OK. Now, the third theory is that --,well, let's ask ourselves what's really going on in synesthesia. All right? 
 So, we found that the color area and the number area,are right next to each other in the brain, in the fusiform gyrus.,So we said, there's some accidental cross wiring,between color and numbers in the brain.,So, every time you see a number, you see a corresponding color,,and that's why you get synesthesia.,Now remember -- why does this happen?,Why would there be crossed wires in some people?,Remember I said it runs in families?,That gives you the clue.,And that is, there is an abnormal gene,,a mutation in the gene that causes this abnormal cross wiring. 
 In all of us, it turns out,we are born with everything wired to everything else.,So, every brain region is wired to every other region,,and these are trimmed down to create,the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain.,So, if there's a gene causing this trimming,and if that gene mutates,,then you get deficient trimming between adjacent brain areas.,And if it's between number and color, you get number-color synesthesia.,If it's between tone and color, you get tone-color synesthesia.,So far, so good. 
 Now, what if this gene is expressed everywhere in the brain,,so everything is cross-connected?,Well, think about what artists, novelists and poets have in common,,the ability to engage in metaphorical thinking,,linking seemingly unrelated ideas,,such as, "It is the east, and Juliet is the Sun.",Well, you don't say, Juliet is the sun,,does that mean she's a glowing ball of fire?,I mean, schizophrenics do that, but it's a different story, right?,Normal people say, she's warm like the sun,,she's radiant like the sun, she's nurturing like the sun.,Instantly, you've found the links. 
 Now, if you assume that this greater cross wiring,and concepts are also in different parts of the brain,,then it's going to create a greater propensity,towards metaphorical thinking and creativity,in people with synesthesia.,And, hence, the eight times more common incidence of synesthesia,among poets, artists and novelists.,OK, it's a very phrenological view of synesthesia.,The last demonstration -- can I take one minute?,(Applause) 
 OK. I'm going to show you that you're all synesthetes, but you're in denial about it.,Here's what I call Martian alphabet. Just like your alphabet,,A is A, B is B, C is C.,Different shapes for different phonemes, right?,Here, you've got Martian alphabet.,One of them is Kiki, one of them is Bouba.,Which one is Kiki and which one is Bouba?,How many of you think that's Kiki and that's Bouba? Raise your hands.,Well, it's one or two mutants.,(Laughter),How many of you think that's Bouba, that's Kiki? Raise your hands.,Ninety-nine percent of you. 
 Now, none of you is a Martian. How did you do that?,It's because you're all doing a cross-model synesthetic abstraction,,meaning you're saying that that sharp inflection -- ki-ki,,in your auditory cortex, the hair cells being excited -- Kiki,,mimics the visual inflection, sudden inflection of that jagged shape.,Now, this is very important, because what it's telling you,is your brain is engaging in a primitive --,it's just -- it looks like a silly illusion,,but these photons in your eye are doing this shape,,and hair cells in your ear are exciting the auditory pattern,,but the brain is able to extract the common denominator.,It's a primitive form of abstraction,,and we now know this happens in the fusiform gyrus of the brain,,because when that's damaged,,these people lose the ability to engage in Bouba Kiki,,but they also lose the ability to engage in metaphor. 
 If you ask this guy, what -- "all that glitters is not gold,",what does that mean?",The patient says, "Well, if it's metallic and shiny, it doesn't mean it's gold.,You have to measure its specific gravity, OK?",So, they completely miss the metaphorical meaning.,So, this area is about eight times the size in higher --,especially in humans -- as in lower primates.,Something very interesting is going on here in the angular gyrus,,because it's the crossroads between hearing, vision and touch,,and it became enormous in humans. And something very interesting is going on.,And I think it's a basis of many uniquely human abilities,like abstraction, metaphor and creativity.,All of these questions that philosophers have been studying for millennia,,we scientists can begin to explore by doing brain imaging,,and by studying patients and asking the right questions.,Thank you.,(Applause),Sorry about that.,(Laughter)I've always wanted to be a cyborg.,One of my favorite shows as a kidnwas "The Six Million Dollar Man,",and this is a little bit closernto the 240-dollar man or so, but -- 
 (Laughter) 
 At any rate, I would normallynfeel very self-conscious and geeky,wearing this around,,but a few days agonI saw one world-renowned statistician,swallowing swords on stage here,,so I figure it's OK amongst this group.,But that's not what I wantnto talk about today.,I want to talk about toys,nand the power that I see inherent in them. 
 When I was a kid,nI attended Montessori school,up to sixth grade in Atlanta, Georgia.,And at the timenI didn't think much about it,,but then later, I realized that that wasnthe high point of my education.,From that point on, everything elsenwas pretty much downhill.,And it wasn't until later,nas I started making games, that --,I really actuallynthink of them more as toys.,People call me a game designer,,but I really thinknof these things more as toys.,I started getting very interestednin Maria Montessori and her methods,,and the way she went about things,,and the way she thought itnvery valuable for kids,to discover things on their own,rather than being taughtnthese things overtly.,And she would design these toys,nwhere kids in playing with the toys,would come to understandnthese deep principles,of life and nature through play.,And since they discovered this,nit stuck with them so much more,,and also they would experiencentheir own failures.,There was a failure-based aspectnto learning there. It was very important.,And so, the games that I do,,I think of really morenas modern Montessori toys.,And I really kind of want themnto be presented in a way,to where kids can kind of explorenand discover their own principles.,So a few years ago, 
 I started getting very interestednin the SETI program.,And that's the way I work.,I get interested in different subjects,nI dive in, research them,,and then try to figure outnhow to craft a toy around that,,so that other people can experiencenthe same sense of discovery,that I did as I was learning that subject.,And it led me to astrobiology,,the study of possible lifenin the universe.,And then Drake's equation,,looking at the probabilitynof life arising on planets,,how long it might last,nhow many planets are out there.,And I started lookingnat how interesting Drake's equation was,,because it spannednall these different subjects --,physics, chemistry,nsociology, economics, astronomy. 
 And another thing that reallynimpressed me a long time ago,was "Powers of Ten,"nCharles and Ray Eames' film.,And I started putting those two togethernand wondering, could I build a toy,where kids would trip acrossnall these interesting principles of life,,as it exists and as it mightngo in the future.,Things where you might trip across things,like the Copernican principle,nthe Fermi paradox,,the anthropic principle,nthe origin of life. 
 And so I'm going to show you a toy todaynthat I've been working on,,that I think of morenas kind of a philosophy toy.,Playing this toy will bring upnphilosophical questions in you. 
 The game is "Spore."nI've been working on it for several years.,It's getting pretty close to finished now.,It occurs at all these different scales,nfrom very small to very large.,I'm going to pop innat the start of the game.,And you actually start this gamenin a drop of water,,as a very, very smallnsingle-cell creature,,and right off the bat you basicallynjust have to live, survive, reproduce.,So here we are,nat a very microscopic scale,,swimming around.,And I actually realizenthat cells don't have eyes,,but it helps to make it cute. 
 The players are going to playnthrough every generation of this species,,and as you play the game,,the creature is actuallyngrowing bit by bit.,And as we start growing,,the camera willnactually start zooming out,,and things that you seenin the background there,will start slowlynpulling into the foreground,,showing you a little bit of whatnyou'll be interacting with as you grow.,So as we eat, the cameranstarts pulling out,,and then we start interactingnwith larger and larger organisms. 
 We actually playnthrough many generations here,,at the cellular scale.,I'm going to skip ahead here.,At some point we get larger,,and we actually getnto a macroevolution scale.,Now, at this pointnwe're leaving the water,,and one thing that's kind of importantnabout this game is that, at every level,,the player is designing their creature,,and that's a fundamental aspect of this. 
 Now, in the evolution game here,nthe creature scale,,basically you have to eat,nsurvive, and then reproduce.,You know, very Darwinian.,One thing we noticed with "The Sims,"na game I did earlier,,is that players love making stuff.,When they were ablento make stuff in the game,,they had a lot of empathynin connection to it.,Even if it wasn't as pretty,as a professional artistnwould make for games,,it really stuck with them,and they really carednabout what would happen to it. 
 At this point, we've left the water,nand now with this little creature --,we could bring upnthe volume a little bit --,and now we might try to eat.,We might sneak upnon this little guy over here maybe,,and try and eat him.,OK, well, we fight. 
 (Creatures grunting) 
 OK, we got him.,Now we get a meal.,So really, at this part of the game,,what we're doing is we'renrunning around and surviving,,and also getting to the next generation,,because we're going to playnthrough every generation of this creature.,We can mate, so I'm going to see,if one of these creaturesnwants to mate with me. Yeah. 
 (Creatures grunting) 
 We didn't want to replaynactual evolution with humans and all that,,because it's almost more interesting,to look at alternatenpossibilities in evolution.,Evolution is usually presentednas this one path that we took through,,but really it representsnthis huge set of possibilities.,Now, once we mate, we click on the egg.,And this is where the gamenstarts getting interesting,,because one of the thingsnwe really focused on here,was giving the playersnvery high-leverage tools,,so that for very little effort,nthe player can make something very cool.,And it involves a lotnof intelligence on the tool side. 
 But basically, this is the editor,where we're going to designnthe next generation.,So it has a little spine.nI can move around, I can extend.,I can also inflate or deflate itnwith the mouse wheel,,so you sculpt it like clay.,We have parts herenthat I can put on or pull off.,The idea is that the playerncan basically design,anything they can think of in this editor,,and we'll basically bring it to life.,So I might put some limbsnon the character here.,I'll inflate them kind of large.,And in this casenI might decide I'm going to put --,I'll put mouths on the limbs. 
 So pretty much players are encouragednto be very creative in the game.,Here, I'll give it one eye in the middle,nmaybe scale it up a bit. Point it down.,And I'll also give it a few legs.,So in some sense,we want this to feel like an amplifiernfor the player's imagination,,so that with a very small number of clicksna player can create something,that they didn't really thinknwas possible before.,This is almost like designingnsomething like Maya --,that an eight-year-old can use.,But really the goal here was,,within about a minute,nI wanted somebody to replicate,what typically takes a pictorial artistnseveral weeks to create.,OK, now I'll put some hands on it.,OK, so here I've basicallynthrown together a little creature.,Let me give it a little weaponnon the tail here, so it can fight.,OK, so that's the complete model.,Now we can actuallyngo to the painting phase. 
 At this phase, the programnhas some understanding,of the topology of this creature.,It knows where the backbone is,nwhere the spine, the limbs are,,how stripes should run,nhow it should be shaded.,And so we're procedurallyngenerating the texture map,,something a texture artistnwould take many days to work on.,And then we can test it out,nand see how it would move around.,And so at this point the computernis procedurally animating this creature.,It's looking at whatever I've designed.nIt will actually bring it to life.,And I can see how it might dance. 
 (Laughter) 
 How it might show emotions,nhow it might fight.,So it's acting with its two mouths there.,I can even have it pose for a photo.,Snap a little photo of it. 
 (Laughter) 
 So then I bring this back into the game.,It's born, and I play the next generationnof my creature through evolution.,Now again, the empathynthat the players have,when they createnthe content is tremendous.,When players create content in this game,nit's automatically sent up to a server,and then redistributednto all the other players transparently.,So in fact, as I'm interactingnin this world with other creatures,,these creatures are transparentlyncoming from other players as they play.,So the process of playing the game,is a process of building upnthis huge database of content.,And pretty much everythingnyou're going to see in this game,,there's an editor fornthat the player can create,,up through civilization.,This is my baby. When I eat,nI'll actually start growing. 
 This is the next generation.nBut I'm going to skip ahead here.,Normally what would happen isnthese creatures would work their way up,,eventually become intelligent.,I'd start dealing with tribes, citiesnand civilizations of them over time.,I'm going to skip way aheadnto the space phase.,Eventually they would go out into space,,and start colonizingnand exploring the universe.,Now, really, in some sense,,I want the players to be buildingnthis world in their imagination,,and then extracting it from themnwith the least amount of pain. 
 So that's kind ofnwhat these tools are about.,How do we make the gameplay,,you know, basicallynthe player's imagination amplifier?,And how do we makenthese tools, these editors,,something that are just as funnas the game itself?,So this is the planetnthat we've been playing on,up to this point in the game.,So far the entire game has been playednon the surface of this little world here. 
 At this point we're actuallyndealing with a very little toy planet.,Almost, again,nlike the Montessori toy idea.,What happens if you givensomebody a toy planet,,and let them playnwith a lot of dynamics on it?,What could they discover?nWhat might they learn on this?,This world was actually extractednfrom the player's imagination.,So, this is the planetnthat the player evolved on.,Things like the buildings, the vehicles,nthe architecture, civilizations,were all designed by the playernup to this point.,So here's a little city with somenof our guys walking around in it.,And most games put the playernin the role of Luke Skywalker,,this protagonistnplaying through this story.,This is more about putting the playernin the role of George Lucas.,I want them, after they'venplayed this game,,to have extracted an entire worldnthat they're now interacting with. 
 As we pull down here,,we still have a whole set of creaturesnliving on the surface of the planet.,All these differentndynamics going on here.,I can look over here, and this isna little simplified food web,that's going on with the creatures.,I can open this up and then scannwhat exists on the surface. 
 You get some sense of the diversitynof creatures that were brought in.,Some of these were created by the player,,others by other players,nautomatically sent over here.,But there's a very simplencalculation of what's required,,how many plants are requirednfor the herbivores to live,,how many herbivoresnfor the carnivores to eat, etc.,,that you have to balance actively.,Also with this phase,,we're getting more and morenGod-like powers for the player,,and you can experimentnwith this planet as a toy.,So I can come in and I can do things,,and just treat this planetnas a lump of clay.,We have very simplenweather systems, simple geology.,For instance, I could open one of my toolsnhere and then carve out rivers.,So this whole thing is kind ofnlike a big lump of clay, a sculpture.,I can also play with the dynamicsnin this world over time. 
 So one of the things I can do,is start pumping more CO2 gasesninto the atmosphere,,and so that's what I'm doing here.,There's actuallyna little readout down there,of our planetary atmosphere,npressure and temperature.,So as I start pumping in more atmosphere,,we're going to start pushing upnthe greenhouse gases here,and if you'll start noticing,,we start seeingnthe ocean levels rise over time.,And our citiesnare going to be at risk too,,because a lot of these are coastal cities.,You can see the ocean levelsnare rising now,and as they encroach upon the cities,nI'll start losing cities here. 
 So basically, I want the playersnto be able to experiment and explore,a huge amount of failure space.,So there goes one city.,Now, over time, this isngoing to heat up the planet.,So at first what we're going to see,is a global ocean risenhere on this little toy planet,,but then over time --nI can speed it up --,we'll see the heat impact of that as well. 
 Not only will it get hotter,,but at some point it's going to get so hotnthe oceans will evaporate.,They'll go up, and then they'll evaporate,nand that'll be my planet.,So basically, what we're getting here,is the sequel to "An Inconvenient Truth,"nin about two minutes,,and that actually brings upnan interesting point about games.,Now here, our entire oceansnare evaporating off the surface,,and as it keeps getting hotter,,at some point the entire planetnis going to melt down. Here it goes. 
 So we're not onlynsimulating biological dynamics --,food webs and all that --,but also geologic, you know,non a very simple core scale.,And what's interesting to me about games,is that I think we can takena lot of long-term dynamics,and compress themninto very short-term experiences.,Because it's so hard for peoplento think 50 or 100 years out,,but when you can give them a toy,,and they can experience thesenlong-term dynamics in just a few minutes,,I think it's an entirelyndifferent point of view,,where we're actually using the gamento remap our intuition.,It's almost in the same way,that a telescope or microscopenrecalibrates your eyesight;,I think computer simulationsncan recalibrate your instinct,across vast scales of both space and time. 
 So here's our little solar system,,as we pull awaynfrom our melted planet here.,We actually have a couplenof other planets in this solar system.,Let's fly to another one.,We're going to have this unlimitednnumber of worlds you can explore here.,As we move into the future,,and we start going outninto space and doing stuff,,we're drawing a lotnfrom things like science fiction.,And all my favorite science fiction movies,I want to play out herenas different dynamics. 
 This planet actually has some life on it.,Here it is, some indigenousnlife down here.,One of the toolsnI can eventually earn for my UFO,is a monolith that I can drop down. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, as you can see,,these guys are actuallynstarting to go up and bow to it,,and over time, once they touch it,nthey will become intelligent.,So I can actuallynpick a species on a planet,and then make them sentient.,Now they've actuallyngone to tribal dynamics.,And now, becausenI'm actually the one here,,I can get out of the UFO and walk up,,and they should be worshipping menat this point as a god.,At first they're a little freaked out.,OK, well maybe they're not worshipping me. 
 (Laughter) 
 I think I'll leavenbefore they get hostile. 
 But we basically wantna diversity of activities,the players can play through this.,I want to be able to play,"The Day the Earth Stood Still,"n"2001: A Space Odyssey,","Star Trek," "War Of the Worlds.",Now, as we pull away from this world --,we're going to keepnpulling away from the star now.,One of the things that alwaysnfrustrated me about astronomy,when I was a kid,is how it was always presentednso two-dimensionally and so static.,As we pull away from the star here,,we're actually going nownout into interstellar space,,and we're getting a sensenof the space around our home star. 
 What I really wanted to donis to present this, basically,,as wonderfully 3D as it is actually is.,And also show the dynamics,,and a lot of the interesting objectsnthat you might find, like, in the Hubble,,at pretty much realisticnfrequencies and scales.,So most peoplenhave no idea of the difference,between an emission nebulanand a planetary nebula.,But these are the things,that we can putnin this little galaxy here.,So we're flying over herento what looks like a black hole.,I want to basically haventhe entire zoo of Hubble objects,that people can interact withnand play with, again, as toys. 
 So here's a little black hole,that we probablyndon't want to get too close to.,But we also have stars and things as well.,If we pull all the way back,nwe start seeing the entire galaxy here,,kind of slowly in motion.,Typically, when people present galaxies,,it's always beautiful photos,nbut they're always static.,And when you bring it forward in timenand start animating it,,it's amazing what a galaxynwould look like fast forwarded. 
 This would be aboutna million years a second,,because you have aboutnone supernova every century.,And so you'd haventhis wonderful sparkling thing,,with the disk slowly rotating,,and this is roughlynwhat it would look like.,Part of this is about bringingnthe beauty of the natural world,to somebody in a very imaginative way,,so that they can startncalibrating their instinct,across these vast scalesnof space and time. 
 Chris was wondering what kind of godsnthe players would become.,Because if you think about it,,you're going to have 15-year-olds,n20-year-olds flying around this universe.,They might be a nurturing god.,They might be bootstrappingnlife on planets,,trying to terraformnand spread civilization.,You might be a vengeful god, conquesting,,because you actually can do that,nyou can attack other intelligent races.,You might be a networking god,nbuilding alliances,,or just curious, going around and wantingnto explore as much as you possibly can. 
 But basically, the reasonnwhy I make toys like this,is because I thinknif there's one difference,I could possibly make in the world,,that I would choose to make,,it's that I would likento somehow give people,just a little bit better calibrationnon long-term thinking.,Because I think most of the problemsnthat our world is facing right now,are the result of short-term thinking,,and the fact that it is so hard for usnto think 50, 100, or 1,000 years out.,And I think by giving kids toys like thisnand letting them replay dynamics,,very long-term dynamicsnover the short term,,and getting some sensenof what we're doing now,,what it's going to be like in 100 years,,I think probably is the most effectiventhing I can be doing to help the world.,And so that's why I thinknthat toys can change the world. 
 Thank you.So, where are the robots?,We've been told for 40 years already that they're coming soon.,Very soon they'll be doing everything for us.,They'll be cooking, cleaning, buying things, shopping, building. But they aren't here.,Meanwhile, we have illegal immigrants doing all the work,,but we don't have any robots.,So what can we do about that? What can we say?,So I want to give a little bit of a different perspective,of how we can perhaps look at these things in a little bit of a different way.,And this is an x-ray picture,of a real beetle, and a Swiss watch, back from '88. You look at that --,what was true then is certainly true today.,We can still make the pieces. We can make the right pieces.,We can make the circuitry of the right computational power,,but we can't actually put them together to make something,that will actually work and be as adaptive as these systems. 
 So let's try to look at it from a different perspective.,Let's summon the best designer, the mother of all designers.,Let's see what evolution can do for us.,So we threw in -- we created a primordial soup,with lots of pieces of robots -- with bars, with motors, with neurons.,Put them all together, and put all this under kind of natural selection,,under mutation, and rewarded things for how well they can move forward.,A very simple task, and it's interesting to see what kind of things came out of that. 
 So if you look, you can see a lot of different machines,come out of this. They all move around.,They all crawl in different ways, and you can see on the right,,that we actually made a couple of these things,,and they work in reality. These are not very fantastic robots,,but they evolved to do exactly what we reward them for: 
 for moving forward. So that was all done in simulation,,but we can also do that on a real machine.,Here's a physical robot that we actually,have a population of brains,,competing, or evolving on the machine.,It's like a rodeo show. They all get a ride on the machine,,and they get rewarded for how fast or how far,they can make the machine move forward.,And you can see these robots are not ready,to take over the world yet, but,they gradually learn how to move forward,,and they do this autonomously. 
 So in these two examples, we had basically,machines that learned how to walk in simulation,,and also machines that learned how to walk in reality.,But I want to show you a different approach,,and this is this robot over here, which has four legs.,It has eight motors, four on the knees and four on the hip.,It has also two tilt sensors that tell the machine,which way it's tilting. 
 But this machine doesn't know what it looks like.,You look at it and you see it has four legs,,the machine doesn't know if it's a snake, if it's a tree,,it doesn't have any idea what it looks like,,but it's going to try to find that out.,Initially, it does some random motion,,and then it tries to figure out what it might look like.,And you're seeing a lot of things passing through its minds,,a lot of self-models that try to explain the relationship,between actuation and sensing. It then tries to do,a second action that creates the most disagreement,among predictions of these alternative models,,like a scientist in a lab. Then it does that,and tries to explain that, and prune out its self-models. 
 This is the last cycle, and you can see it's pretty much,figured out what its self looks like. And once it has a self-model,,it can use that to derive a pattern of locomotion.,So what you're seeing here are a couple of machines --,a pattern of locomotion.,We were hoping that it wass going to have a kind of evil, spidery walk,,but instead it created this pretty lame way of moving forward. 
 But when you look at that, you have to remember,that this machine did not do any physical trials on how to move forward,,nor did it have a model of itself.,It kind of figured out what it looks like, and how to move forward,,and then actually tried that out.,(Applause) 
 So, we'll move forward to a different idea.,So that was what happened when we had a couple of --,that's what happened when you had a couple of -- OK, OK, OK --,(Laughter),-- they don't like each other. So,there's a different robot.,That's what happened when the robots actually,are rewarded for doing something.,What happens if you don't reward them for anything, you just throw them in? 
 So we have these cubes, like the diagram showed here.,The cube can swivel, or flip on its side,,and we just throw 1,000 of these cubes into a soup --,this is in simulation --and don't reward them for anything,,we just let them flip. We pump energy into this,and see what happens in a couple of mutations.,So, initially nothing happens, they're just flipping around there.,But after a very short while, you can see these blue things,on the right there begin to take over. 
 They begin to self-replicate. So in absence of any reward,,the intrinsic reward is self-replication.,And we've actually built a couple of these,,and this is part of a larger robot made out of these cubes.,It's an accelerated view, where you can see the robot actually,carrying out some of its replication process.,So you're feeding it with more material -- cubes in this case --,and more energy, and it can make another robot.,So of course, this is a very crude machine,,but we're working on a micro-scale version of these,,and hopefully the cubes will be like a powder that you pour in. 
 OK, so what can we learn? These robots are of course,not very useful in themselves, but they might teach us something,about how we can build better robots,,and perhaps how humans, animals, create self-models and learn.,And one of the things that I think is important,is that we have to get away from this idea,of designing the machines manually,,but actually let them evolve and learn, like children,,and perhaps that's the way we'll get there. Thank you.,(Applause)We are going to talk today about the sequel of "Inconvenient Truth.",It's time again to talk about "Inconvenient Truth,",a truth that everyone is concerned about,,but nobody is willing to talk about.,Somebody has to take the lead, and I decided to do it.,If you are scared by global warming,,wait until we learn about local warming.,We will talk today about local warming. 
 Important health message: blogging may be hazardous to your health,,especially if you are a male.,This message is given as a public service.,Blogging affects your posture. We start with the posture.,This is the posture of ladies who are not blogging;,this is the posture of ladies who are blogging.,(Laughter),This is the natural posture of a man sitting,,squatting for ventilation purposes.,(Laughter),And this is the natural posture of a standing man,,and I think this picture inspired Chris to insert me,into the lateral thinking session.,This is male blogging posture sitting, and the result is,,"For greater comfort,,men naturally sit with their legs farther apart than women,,when working on laptop.,However, they will adopt a less natural posture,in order to balance it on their laps,,which resulted in a significant rise of body heat,between their thighs." This is the issue of local warming.,(Laughter) 
 This is a very serious newspaper; it's Times of England --,very serious. This is a very --,(Laughter),-- gentlemen and ladies, be serious.,This is a very serious research, that you should read the underline.,And be careful, your genes are in danger.,Will geeks become endangered species?,The fact: population growth in countries with high laptop --,(Laughter),I need Hans Rosling to give me a graph.,(Applause),Global warming fun.,(Laughter),But let's keep things in proportion. 
 How to take care in five easy steps:,first of all, you can use natural ventilation. You can use body breath.,You should stay cool with the appropriate clothing.,You should care about your posture -- this is not right.,Can you extract from Chris another minute and a half for me,,because I have a video I have to show you.,(Applause) 
 You are great. This is the correct posture.,Another benefit of Wi-Fi, we learned yesterday about the benefits of Wi-Fi.,Wi-Fi enables you to avoid the processor. And there are some enhanced,protection measures, which I would like to share with you,,and I would like, in a minute, to thank Philips for helping.,This is a research which was done in '86, but it's still valid.,Scrotal temperature reflects intratesticular temperature,and is lowered by shaving. 
 By the way, I must admit, my English is not so good,,I didn't know what is scrotal; I understand it's a scrotum.,I guess in plural it's scrotal, like medium and media.,Digital scrotum, digital media.,And only last year I recognized that I'm a proud scrotum owner.,(Laughter) 
 And this research is being precipitated by the U.S. government,,so you can see that your tax man is working for good causes. 
 Video: Man: The Philips Bodygroom has a sleek,,ergonomic design for a safe and easy way to trim,those scruffy underarm hairs, the untidy curls on and around your,[bleep], as well as the hard to reach locks on the underside of your,[bleep] and [bleep]. Once you use the Bodygroom, the world looks different.,And so does your [bleep]. These days, with a hair-free back,,well-groomed shoulders and an extra optical inch on my [bleep],,well, let's just say life has gotten pretty darn cozy. 
 Yossi Vardi: This is one of the most popular viral advertisement of last year,,known as the optical inch by Philips. Let's applaud Philips --,(Applause),-- for this gesture for humanity.,And this is how they are promoting the product. This is --,I didn't touch it, this is original.,Laptop use to solve overpopulation. And if everything failed,,there are some secondary uses. 
 And then our next talk, our next TED if you invite me,will be why you should not carry a cell phone in your pocket.,And this is what the young generation says.,(Applause),And I just want to show you that I'm not just preaching,,but I also practice.,(Laughter),4 am in the morning.,(Laughter),You cannot use this picture.,(Applause) 
 Now, I have some mini TED Prizes, this is the Philips Bodygroom,,one for our leader.,(Applause),Anybody feels threatened, anybody really need it?,(Laughter),Any lady, any lady? Thank you very much.,(Applause)I thought in getting up to my TED wish,I would try to begin by putting in nperspective what I try to do,and how it fits with what they try to do.,We live in a world that everyone knows is interdependent,,but insufficient in three major ways.,It is, first of all, profoundly unequal:,half the world's people still living on less than two dollars a day;,a billion people with no access to clean water;,two and a half billion no access to sanitation;,a billion going to bed hungry every night;,one in four deaths every year from AIDS, TB, malaria,and the variety of infections associated with dirty water --,80 percent of them under five years of age. 
 Even in wealthy countries it is common now to see inequality growing.,In the United States, since 2001 we've had five years of economic growth,,five years of productivity growth in the workplace,,but median wages are stagnant and the percentage of working families,dropping below the poverty line is up by four percent.,The percentage of working families without health care up by four percent.,So this interdependent world which has been pretty good to most of us --,which is why we're all here in Northern California doing what we do,for a living, enjoying this evening -- is profoundly unequal.,It is also unstable.,Unstable because of the threats of terror,,weapons of mass destruction, the spread of global disease,and a sense that we are vulnerable to it in a way that we weren't not so many years ago.,And perhaps most important of all, it is unsustainable,because of climate change, resource depletion and species destruction. 
 When I think about the world I would like to leave to my daughter,and the grandchildren I hope to have,,it is a world that moves away from unequal, unstable, unsustainable,interdependence to integrated communities -- locally, nationally and globally --,that share the characteristics of all successful communities:,a broadly shared, accessible set of opportunities,,a shared sense of responsibility for the success of the common enterprise,and a genuine sense of belonging.,All easier said than done.,When the terrorist incidents occurred in the United Kingdom a couple of years ago,,I think even though they didn't claim as many lives as we lost in the United States on 9/11,,I think the thing that troubled the British most,was that the perpetrators were not invaders, but homegrown citizens,whose religious and political identities were more important to them,than the people they grew up with, went to school with,,worked with, shared weekends with, shared meals with.,In other words, they thought their differences,were more important than their common humanity.,It is the central psychological plague of humankind in the 21st century. 
 Into this mix, people like us, who are not in public office,,have more power to do good than at any time in history,,because more than half the world's people,live under governments they voted in and can vote out.,And even non-democratic governments are more sensitive to public opinion.,Because primarily of the power of the Internet,,people of modest means can band together and amass vast sums of money,that can change the world for some public good if they all agree.,When the tsunami hit South Asia, the United States contributed 1.2 billion dollars.,30 percent of our households gave.,Half of them gave over the Internet.,The median contribution was somewhere around 57 dollars.,And thirdly, because of the rise of non-governmental organizations.,They, businesses, other citizens' groups, have enormous power,to affect the lives of our fellow human beings.,When I became president in 1993,,there were none of these organizations in Russia.,There are now a couple of hundred thousand.,None in India. There are now at least a half a million active.,None in China. There are now 250,000 registered with the government,,probably twice again that many who are not registered for political reasons. 
 When I organized my foundation, and I thought about the world as it is,and the world that I hope to leave to the next generation,,and I tried to be realistic about what I had cared about all my life,that I could still have an impact on.,I wanted to focus on activities,that would help to alleviate poverty, fight disease, combat climate change,,bridge the religious, racial and other divides that torment the world,,but to do it in a way that would either use,whatever particular skills we could put together in our group,to change the way some public good function was performed,so that it would sweep across the world more. 
 You saw one reference to that in what we were able to do with AIDS drugs.,And I want to say that the head of our AIDS effort,,and the person who also is primarily active in the wish I'll make tonight,,Ira Magaziner, is here with me and I want to thank him for everything he's done.,He's over there.,(Applause),When I got out of office and was asked to work, first in the Caribbean,,to try to help deal with the AIDS crisis,,generic drugs were available for about 500 dollars a person a year.,If you bought them in vast bulks,,you could get them at a little under 400 dollars.,The first country we went to work in, the Bahamas,,was paying 3,500 dollars for these drugs.,The market was so terribly disorganized,that they were buying this medicine through two agents,who were gigging them sevenfold.,So the very first week we were working,,we got the price down to 500 dollars.,And all of a sudden, they could save seven times as many lives,for the same amount of money. 
 Then we went to work with the manufacturers of AIDS medicines,,one of whom was cited in the film,,and negotiated a whole different change in business strategy,,because even at 500 dollars, these drugs,were being sold on a high-margin, low-volume, uncertain-payment basis.,So we worked on improving the productivity of the operations,and the supply chain, and went to a low-margin, high-volume,,absolutely certain-payment business.,I joked that the main contribution we made,to the battle against AIDS was to get the manufacturers,to change from a jewelry store to a grocery store strategy.,But the price went to 140 dollars from 500.,And pretty soon, the average price was 192 dollars.,Now we can get it for about 100 dollars.,Children's medicine was 600 dollars,,because nobody could afford to buy any of it.,We negotiated it down to 190.,Then, the French imposed their brilliantly conceived airline tax,to create a something called UNITAID,,got a bunch of other countries to help.,That children's medicine is now 60 dollars a person a year. 
 The only thing that is keeping us from basically saving the lives,of everybody who needs the medicine to stay alive,are the absence of systems necessary to diagnose, treat and care,for people and deliver this medicine.,We started a childhood obesity initiative with the Heart Association in America.,We tried to do the same thing by negotiating industry-right deals,with the soft drink and the snack food industry to cut the caloric,and other dangerous content of food going to our children in the schools.,We just reorganized the markets.,And it occurred to me that in this whole non-governmental world,,somebody needs to be thinking about organizing public goods markets.,And that is now what we're trying to do,,and working with this large cities group to fight climate change,,to negotiate huge, big, volume deals that will enable cities,which generate 75 percent of the world's greenhouse gases,,to drastically and quickly reduce greenhouse gas emissions,in a way that is good economics.,And this whole discussion as if it's some sort of economic burden,,is a mystery to me.,I think it's a bird's nest on the ground. 
 When Al Gore won his well-deserved Oscar,for the "Inconvenient Truth" movie, I was thrilled,,but I had urged him to make a second movie quickly.,For those of you who saw "An Inconvenient Truth,",the most important slide in the Gore lecture is the last one,,which shows here's where greenhouse gases are going,if we don't do anything, here's where they could go.,And then there are six different categories,of things we can do to change the trajectory.,We need a movie on those six categories.,And all of you need to have it embedded in your brains,and to organize yourselves around it.,So we're trying to do that. 
 So organizing these markets is one thing we try to do.,Now we have taken on a second thing, and this gets to my wish.,It has been my experience in working in developing countries,that while the headlines may all be -- the pessimistic headlines may say,,well, we can't do this, that or the other thing because of corruption --,I think incapacity is a far bigger problem in poor countries than corruption,,and feeds corruption.,We now have the money, given these low prices, to distribute,AIDS drugs all over the world to people we cannot presently reach.,Today these low prices are available in the 25 countries where we work,,and in a total of 62 countries,,and about 550,000 people are getting the benefits of them.,But the money is there to reach others.,The systems are not there to reach the people. 
 So what we have been trying to do,,working first in Rwanda and then in Malawi and other places --,but I want to talk about Rwanda tonight --,is to develop a model for rural health care in a very poor area,that can be used to deal with AIDS, TB, malaria, other infectious diseases,,maternal and child health, and a whole range of health issues,poor people are grappling with in the developing world,,that can first be scaled for the whole nation of Rwanda,,and then will be a model that could literally,be implemented in any other poor country in the world. 
 And the test is: one, will it do the job?,Will it provide high quality care?,And two, will it do it at a price,that will enable the country to sustain a health care system,without foreign donors after five to 10 years?,Because the longer I deal with these problems,,the more convinced I am that we have to --,whether it's economics, health, education, whatever --,we have to build systems.,And the absence of systems that function,break the connection which got you all in this seat tonight.,You think about whatever your life has been,,however many obstacles you have faced in your life,,at critical junctures you always knew,there was a predictable connection between the effort you exerted,and the result you achieved.,In a world with no systems, with chaos,,everything becomes a guerilla struggle,,and this predictability is not there.,And it becomes almost impossible to save lives,,educate kids, develop economies, whatever. 
 The person, in my view,,who has done the best job of this in the health care area,,of building a system in a very poor area, is Dr. Paul Farmer,,who, many of you know, has worked for now 20 years with his group,,Partners in Health, primarily in Haiti where he started,,but they've also worked in Russia, in Peru,and other places around the world.,As poor as Haiti is, in the area where Farmer's clinic is active --,and they serve a catchment area far greater,than the medical professionals they have would indicate they could serve --,since 1988, they have not lost one person to tuberculosis, not one.,And they've achieved a lot of other amazing health results.,So when we decided to work in Rwanda,on trying to dramatically increase the income of the country and fight the AIDS problem,,we wanted to build a healthcare network,,because it had been totally destroyed during the genocide in 1994,,and the per capita income was still under a dollar a day.,So I rang up, asked Paul Farmer if he would help.,Because it seemed to me if we could prove there was a model in Haiti,and a model in Rwanda that we could then take all over the country,,number one, it would be a wonderful thing for a country,that has suffered as much as any on Earth in the last 15 years,,and number two, we would have something that could then be adapted,to any other poor country anywhere in the world.,And so we have set about doing that. 
 Now, we started working together 18 months ago.,And we're working in an area called Southern Kayonza,,which is one of the poorest areas in Rwanda,,with a group that originally includes about 400,000 people.,We're essentially implementing what Paul Farmer did in Haiti:,he develops and trains paid community health workers,who are able to identify health problems,,ensure that people who have AIDS or TB are properly diagnosed,and take their medicine regularly,,who work on bringing about health education, clean water and sanitation,,providing nutritional supplements and moving people up the chain of health care,if they have problems of the severity that require it.,The procedures that make this work have been perfected,,as I said, by Paul Farmer and his team,in their work in rural Haiti over the last 20 years.,Recently we did an evaluation of the first 18 months of our efforts in Rwanda.,And the results were so good that the Rwandan government,has now agreed to adopt the model for the entire country,,and has strongly supported and put the full resources of the government behind it. 
 I'll tell you a little bit about our team because it's indicative of what we do.,We have about 500 people around the world,working in our AIDS program, some of them for nothing --,just for transportation, room and board.,And then we have others working in these other related programs.,Our business plan in Rwanda,was put together under the leadership of Diana Noble,,who is an unusually gifted woman,,but not unusual in the type of people who have been willing to do this kind of work.,She was the youngest partner at Schroder Ventures in London in her 20s.,She was CEO of a successful e-venture --,she started and built Reed Elsevier Ventures --,and at 45 she decided she wanted to do something different with her life.,So she now works full-time on this for very little pay.,She and her team of former business people have created a business plan,that will enable us to scale this health system up for the whole country.,And it would be worthy of the kind of private equity work,she used to do when she was making a lot more money for it. 
 When we came to this rural area, 45 percent of the children under the age of five,had stunted growth due to malnutrition.,23 percent of them died before they reached the age of five.,Mortality at birth was over two-and-a-half percent.,Over 15 percent of the deaths among adults and children occurred,because of intestinal parasites and diarrhea from dirty water and inadequate sanitation --,all entirely preventable and treatable.,Over 13 percent of the deaths were from respiratory illnesses --,again, all preventable and treatable.,And not a single soul in this area was being treated for AIDS or tuberculosis. 
 Within the first 18 months, the following things happened:,we went from zero to about 2,000 people being treated for AIDS.,That's 80 percent of the people who need treatment in this area.,Listen to this: less than four-tenths of one percent of those being treated,stopped taking their medicine or otherwise defaulted on treatment.,That's lower than the figure in the United States.,Less than three-tenths of one percent,had to transfer to the more expensive second-line drugs.,400,000 pregnant women were brought into counseling,and will give birth for the first time within an organized healthcare system.,That's about 43 percent of all the pregnancies.,About 40 percent of all the people -- I said 400,000. I meant 40,000.,About 40 percent of all the people who need TB treatment are now getting it --,in just 18 months, up from zero when we started.,43 percent of the children in need of an infant feeding program,to prevent malnutrition and early death,are now getting the food supplements they need to stay alive and to grow. 
 We've started the first malaria treatment programs they've ever had there.,Patients admitted to a hospital that was destroyed during the genocide,that we have renovated along with four other clinics,,complete with solar power generators, good lab technology.,We now are treating 325 people a month,,despite the fact that almost 100 percent of the AIDS patients are now treated at home.,And the most important thing is,because we've implemented Paul Farmer's model, using community health workers,,we estimate that this system could be put into place for all of Rwanda,for between five and six percent of GDP,,and that the government could sustain that,without depending on foreign aid after five or six years.,And for those of you who understand healthcare economics,you know that all wealthy countries spend between nine and 11 percent of GDP,on health care, except for the United States, we spend 16 --,but that's a story for another day.,(Laughter) 
 We're now working with Partners in Health and the Ministry of Health in Rwanda,and our Foundation folks to scale this system up.,We're also beginning to do this in Malawi and Lesotho.,And we have similar projects in Tanzania, Mozambique,,Kenya and Ethiopia with other partners trying to achieve the same thing:,to save as many lives as quickly as we can,,but to do it in a systematic way that can be implemented nationwide,and then with a model that can be implemented in any country in the world.,We need initial upfront investment to train doctors, nurses,,health administration and community health workers throughout the country,,to set up the information technology, the solar energy,,the water and sanitation, the transportation infrastructure.,But over a five- to 10-year period,,we will take down the need for outside assistance,and eventually it will be phased out. 
 My wish is that TED assist us in our work and help us to build,a high-quality rural health system in a poor country, Rwanda,,that can be a model for Africa,,and indeed, for any poor country anywhere in the world.,My belief is that this will help us to build a more integrated world,with more partners and fewer terrorists,,with more productive citizens and fewer haters,,a place we'd all want our kids and our grandchildren to grow up in.,It has been an honor for me, particularly, to work in Rwanda,where we also have a major economic development project,in partnership with Sir Tom Hunter, the Scottish philanthropist,,where last year we, using the same thing with AIDS drugs,,cut the cost of fertilizer and the interest rates on microcredit loans by 30 percent,and achieved three- to four-hundred percent increases,in crop yields with the farmers. 
 These people have been through a lot and none of us, most of all me,,helped them when they were on the verge of destroying each other.,We're undoing that now, and they are so over it and so into their future.,We're doing this in an environmentally responsible way.,I'm doing my best to convince them not to run the electric grid,to the 35 percent of the people that have no access,,but to do it with clean energy. To have responsible reforestation projects,,the Rwandans, interestingly enough, have been quite good, Mr. Wilson,,in preserving their topsoil.,There's a couple of guys from southern farming families --,the first thing I did when I went out to this place,was to get down on my hands and knees and dig in the dirt,and see what they'd done with it. 
 We have a chance here to prove that a country,that almost slaughtered itself out of existence,can practice reconciliation, reorganize itself, focus on tomorrow,and provide comprehensive, quality health care with minimal outside help.,I am grateful for this prize, and I will use it to that end.,We could use some more help to do this,,but think of what it would mean if we could have a world-class health system,in Rwanda -- in a country with a less-than-one-dollar-a-day-per-capita income,,one that could save hundreds of millions of lives,over the next decade if applied to every similarly situated country on Earth.,It's worth a try and I believe it would succeed.,Thank you and God bless you.,(Applause)I have all my life wondered what "mind-boggling" meant.,After two days here, I declare myself boggled, and enormously impressed,,and feel that you are one of the great hopes --,not just for American achievement in science and technology,,but for the whole world.,I've come, however, on a special mission on behalf of my constituency,,which are the 10-to-the-18th-power -- that's a million trillion --,insects and other small creatures, and to make a plea for them.,If we were to wipe out insects alone, just that group alone, on this planet --,which we are trying hard to do --,the rest of life and humanity with it would mostly disappear from the land.,And within a few months.,Now, how did I come to this particular position of advocacy? 
 As a little boy, and through my teenage years,,I became increasingly fascinated by the diversity of life.,I had a butterfly period, a snake period, a bird period, a fish period, a cave period,and finally and definitively, an ant period.,By my college years, I was a devoted myrmecologist,,a specialist on the biology of ants,,but my attention and research continued to make journeys,across the great variety of life on Earth in general --,including all that it means to us as a species, how little we understand it,and how pressing a danger that our activities have created for it. 
 Out of that broader study has emerged a concern and an ambition,,crystallized in the wish that I'm about to make to you.,My choice is the culmination of a lifetime commitment,that began with growing up on the Gulf Coast of Alabama, on the Florida peninsula.,As far back as I can remember, I was enchanted by the natural beauty of that region,and the almost tropical exuberance of the plants and animals that grow there.,One day when I was only seven years old and fishing,,I pulled a "pinfish," they're called, with sharp dorsal spines, up too hard and fast,,and I blinded myself in one eye.,I later discovered I was also hard of hearing,,possibly congenitally, in the upper registers.,So in planning to be a professional naturalist --,I never considered anything else in my entire life --,I found that I was lousy at bird watching and couldn't track frog calls either.,So I turned to the teeming small creatures,that can be held between the thumb and forefinger:,the little things that compose the foundation of our ecosystems,,the little things, as I like to say, who run the world.,In so doing, I reached a frontier of biology so strange, so rich,,that it seemed as though it exists on another planet.,In fact, we live on a mostly unexplored planet.,The great majority of organisms on Earth remain unknown to science. 
 In the last 30 years, thanks to explorations in remote parts of the world,and advances in technology,,biologists have, for example, added a full one-third of the known frog and other amphibian species,,to bring the current total to 5,400,,and more continue to pour in.,Two new kinds of whales have been discovered, along with two new antelopes,,dozens of monkey species and a new kind of elephant --,and even a distinct kind of gorilla.,At the extreme opposite end of the size scale, the class of marine bacteria,,the Prochlorococci -- that will be on the final exam --,although discovered only in 1988, are now recognized as likely the most abundant organisms on Earth,,and moreover, responsible for a large part of the photosynthesis that occurs in the ocean.,These bacteria were not uncovered sooner,because they are also among the smallest of all Earth's organisms --,so minute that they cannot be seen with conventional optical microscopy.,Yet life in the sea may depend on these tiny creatures. 
 These examples are just the first glimpse of our ignorance of life on this planet.,Consider the fungi -- including mushrooms, rusts, molds and many disease-causing organisms.,60,000 species are known to science,,but more than 1.5 million have been estimated to exist.,Consider the nematode roundworm, the most abundant of all animals.,Four out of five animals on Earth are nematode worms --,if all solid materials except nematode worms were to be eliminated,,you could still see the ghostly outline of most of it in nematode worms.,About 16,000 species of nematode worms,have been discovered and diagnosed by scientists;,there could be hundreds of thousands of them, even millions, still unknown.,This vast domain of hidden biodiversity is increased still further,by the dark matter of the biological world of bacteria,,which within just the last several years,still were known from only about 6,000 species of bacteria worldwide.,But that number of bacteria species can be found in one gram of soil,,just a little handful of soil, in the 10 billion bacteria that would be there.,It's been estimated that a single ton of soil -- fertile soil --,contains approximately four million species of bacteria, all unknown. 
 So the question is: what are they all doing?,The fact is, we don't know.,We are living on a planet with a lot of activities, with reference to our living environment,,done by faith and guess alone.,Our lives depend upon these creatures.,To take an example close to home: there are over 500 species of bacteria now known --,friendly bacteria -- living symbiotically in your mouth and throat,probably necessary to your health for holding off pathogenic bacteria. 
 At this point I think we have a little impressionistic film,that was made especially for this occasion.,And I'd like to show it.,Assisted in this by Billie Holiday.,(Video) 
 And that may be just the beginning!,The viruses, those quasi-organisms among which are the prophages,,the gene weavers that promote the continued evolution in the lives of the bacteria,,are a virtually unknown frontier of modern biology, a world unto themselves.,What constitutes a viral species is still unresolved,,although they're obviously of enormous importance to us.,But this much we can say: the variety of genes on the planet in viruses,exceeds, or is likely to exceed, that in all of the rest of life combined.,Nowadays, in addressing microbial biodiversity,,scientists are like explorers in a rowboat launched onto the Pacific Ocean. 
 But that is changing rapidly with the aid of new genomic technology.,Already it is possible to sequence the entire genetic code of a bacterium in under four hours.,Soon we will be in a position to go forth in the field with sequencers on our backs --,to hunt bacteria in tiny crevices of the habitat's surface,in the way you go watching for birds with binoculars.,What will we find as we map the living world, as, finally, we get this underway seriously?,As we move past the relatively gigantic mammals, birds, frogs and plants,to the more elusive insects and other small invertebrates and then beyond,to the countless millions of organisms in the invisible living world,enveloped and living within humanity?,Already what were thought to be bacteria for generations,have been found to compose, instead, two great domains of microorganisms:,true bacteria and one-celled organisms the archaea,,which are closer than other bacteria to the eukaryota, the group that we belong to. 
 Some serious biologists, and I count myself among them,,have begun to wonder that among the enormous and still unknown diversity of microorganisms,,one might -- just might -- find aliens among them.,True aliens, stocks that arrived from outer space.,They've had billions of years to do it,,but especially during the earliest period of biological evolution on this planet.,We do know that some bacterial species that have earthly origin,are capable of almost unimaginable extremes of temperature,and other harsh changes in environment,,including hard radiation strong enough and maintained long enough to crack the Pyrex vessels,around the growing population of bacteria.,There may be a temptation to treat the biosphere holistically,and the species that compose it as a great flux of entities,hardly worth distinguishing one from the other.,But each of these species, even the tiniest Prochlorococci,,are masterpieces of evolution.,Each has persisted for thousands to millions of years.,Each is exquisitely adapted to the environment in which it lives,,interlocked with other species to form ecosystems upon which our own lives depend,in ways we have not begun even to imagine.,We will destroy these ecosystems and the species composing them,at the peril of our own existence --,and unfortunately we are destroying them with ingenuity and ceaseless energy. 
 My own epiphany as a conservationist came in 1953, while a Harvard graduate student,,searching for rare ants found in the mountain forests of Cuba,,ants that shine in the sunlight --,metallic green or metallic blue, according to species, and one species, I discovered, metallic gold.,I found my magical ants, but only after a tough climb into the mountains,where the last of the native Cuban forests hung on,,and were then -- and still are -- being cut back.,I realized then that these species,and a large part of the other unique, marvelous animals and plants on that island --,and this is true of practically every part of the world --,which took millions of years to evolve, are in the process of disappearing forever.,And so it is everywhere one looks. 
 The human juggernaut is permanently eroding Earth's ancient biosphere by a combination of forces,that can be summarized by the acronym "HIPPO," the animal hippo.,H is for habitat destruction, including climate change forced by greenhouse gases.,I is for the invasive species like the fire ants, the zebra mussels, broom grasses,and pathogenic bacteria and viruses that are flooding every country, and at an exponential rate -- that's the I.,The P, the first one in "HIPPO," is for pollution.,The second is for continued population, human population expansion.,And the final letter is O, for over-harvesting --,driving species into extinction by excessive hunting and fishing.,The HIPPO juggernaut we have created, if unabated, is destined --,according to the best estimates of ongoing biodiversity research --,to reduce half of Earth's still surviving animal and plant species,to extinction or critical endangerment by the end of the century.,Human-forced climate change alone -- again, if unabated --,could eliminate a quarter of surviving species during the next five decades.,What will we and all future generations lose,if much of the living environment is thus degraded?,Huge potential sources of scientific information yet to be gathered,,much of our environmental stability,and new kinds of pharmaceuticals and new products of unimaginable strength and value --,all thrown away. 
 The loss will inflict a heavy price,in wealth, security and yes, spirituality for all time to come,,because previous cataclysms of this kind --,the last one, that ended the age of dinosaurs --,took, normally, five to 10 million years to repair.,Sadly, our knowledge of biodiversity is so incomplete,that we are at risk of losing a great deal of it before it is even discovered.,For example, even in the United States, the 200,000 species known currently,actually has been found to be only partial in coverage;,it is mostly unknown to us in basic biology.,Only about 15 percent of the known species have been studied well enough to evaluate their status.,Of the 15 percent evaluated, 20 percent are classified as "in peril,",that is, in danger of extinction.,That's in the United States.,We are, in short, flying blind into our environmental future.,We urgently need to change this.,We need to have the biosphere properly explored,so that we can understand and competently manage it.,We need to settle down before we wreck the planet.,And we need that knowledge. 
 This should be a big science project equivalent to the Human Genome Project.,It should be thought of as a biological moonshot with a timetable.,So this brings me to my wish for TEDsters,,and to anyone else around the world who hears this talk.,I wish we will work together to help create the key tools,that we need to inspire preservation of Earth's biodiversity.,And let us call it the "Encyclopedia of Life.",What is the "Encyclopedia of Life?" A concept that has already taken hold,and is beginning to spread and be looked at seriously?,It is an encyclopedia that lives on the Internet,and is contributed to by thousands of scientists around the world.,Amateurs can do it also.,It has an indefinitely expandable page for each species. 
 It makes all key information about life on Earth accessible to anyone,,on demand, anywhere in the world.,I've written about this idea before,,and I know there are people in this room who have expended significant effort on it in the past.,But what excites me is that since I first put forward this particular idea in that form,,science has advanced.,Technology has moved forward.,Today, the practicalities of making such an encyclopedia,,regardless of the magnitude of the information put into it, are within reach.,Indeed, in the past year, a group of influential scientific institutions,have begun mobilizing to realize this dream.,I wish you would help them.,Working together, we can make this real. 
 The encyclopedia will quickly pay for itself in practical applications.,It will address transcendent qualities in the human consciousness, and sense of human need.,It will transform the science of biology in ways of obvious benefit to humanity.,And most of all, it can inspire a new generation of biologists,to continue the quest that started, for me personally, 60 years ago:,to search for life, to understand it and finally, above all, to preserve it.,That is my wish. Thank you.As someone who has spent his entire career trying to be invisible 
 standing in front of an audience is a cross between,an out-of-body experience and a deer caught in the headlights,,so please forgive me for violating one of the TED commandments,by relying on words on paper,,and I only hope I'm not struck by lightning bolts before I'm done.,I'd like to begin by talking about some of the ideas that motivated me,to become a documentary photographer. 
 I was a student in the '60s, a time of social upheaval and questioning,,and on a personal level, an awakening sense of idealism.,The war in Vietnam was raging;,the Civil Rights Movement was under way;,and pictures had a powerful influence on me.,Our political and military leaders were telling us one thing,,and photographers were telling us another.,I believed the photographers, and so did millions of other Americans.,Their images fueled resistance to the war and to racism.,They not only recorded history; they helped change the course of history.,Their pictures became part of our collective consciousness,and, as consciousness evolved into a shared sense of conscience,,change became not only possible, but inevitable. 
 I saw that the free flow of information represented by journalism,,specifically visual journalism, can bring into focus,both the benefits and the cost of political policies.,It can give credit to sound decision-making, adding momentum to success.,In the face of poor political judgment or political inaction,,it becomes a kind of intervention, assessing the damage,and asking us to reassess our behavior.,It puts a human face on issues,which from afar can appear abstract,or ideological or monumental in their global impact.,What happens at ground level, far from the halls of power,,happens to ordinary citizens one by one. 
 And I understood that documentary photography,has the ability to interpret events from their point of view.,It gives a voice to those who otherwise would not have a voice.,And as a reaction, it stimulates public opinion,and gives impetus to public debate,,thereby preventing the interested parties,from totally controlling the agenda, much as they would like to.,Coming of age in those days made real,the concept that the free flow of information is absolutely vital,for a free and dynamic society to function properly.,The press is certainly a business, and in order to survive,it must be a successful business,,but the right balance must be found,between marketing considerations and journalistic responsibility. 
 Society's problems can't be solved until they're identified.,On a higher plane, the press is a service industry,,and the service it provides is awareness.,Every story does not have to sell something.,There's also a time to give.,That was a tradition I wanted to follow.,Seeing the war created such incredibly high stakes for everyone involved,and that visual journalism could actually become a factor in conflict resolution --,I wanted to be a photographer in order to be a war photographer.,But I was driven by an inherent sense,that a picture that revealed the true face of war,would almost by definition be an anti-war photograph. 
 I'd like to take you on a visual journey through some of the events,and issues I've been involved in over the past 25 years.,In 1981, I went to Northern Ireland.,10 IRA prisoners were in the process of starving themselves to death,in protest against conditions in jail.,The reaction on the streets was violent confrontation.,I saw that the front lines of contemporary wars,are not on isolated battlefields, but right where people live.,During the early '80s, I spent a lot of time in Central America,,which was engulfed by civil wars,that straddled the ideological divide of the Cold War. 
 In Guatemala, the central government --,controlled by a oligarchy of European decent --,was waging a scorched Earth campaign against an indigenous rebellion,,and I saw an image that reflected the history of Latin America:,conquest through a combination of the Bible and the sword.,An anti-Sandinista guerrilla was mortally wounded,as Commander Zero attacked a town in Southern Nicaragua.,A destroyed tank belonging to Somoza's national guard,was left as a monument in a park in Managua,,and was transformed by the energy and spirit of a child.,At the same time, a civil war was taking place in El Salvador,,and again, the civilian population was caught up in the conflict. 
 I've been covering the Palestinian-Israeli conflict since 1981.,This is a moment from the beginning of the second intifada, in 2000,,when it was still stones and Molotovs against an army.,In 2001, the uprising escalated into an armed conflict,,and one of the major incidents was,the destruction of the Palestinian refugee camp,in the West Bank town of Jenin.,Without the political will to find common ground,,the continual friction of tactic and counter-tactic,only creates suspicion and hatred and vengeance,,and perpetuates the cycle of violence. 
 In the '90s, after the breakup of the Soviet Union,,Yugoslavia fractured along ethnic fault lines, and civil war broke out,between Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia.,This is a scene of house-to-house fighting in Mostar,,neighbor against neighbor.,A bedroom, the place where people share intimacy,,where life itself is conceived, became a battlefield.,A mosque in northern Bosnia was destroyed by Serbian artillery,and was used as a makeshift morgue.,Dead Serbian soldiers were collected after a battle,and used as barter for the return of prisoners,or Bosnian soldiers killed in action.,This was once a park.,The Bosnian soldier who guided me,told me that all of his friends were there now. 
 At the same time in South Africa,,after Nelson Mandela had been released from prison,,the black population commenced the final phase,of liberation from apartheid.,One of the things I had to learn as a journalist,was what to do with my anger.,I had to use it, channel its energy, turn it into something,that would clarify my vision, instead of clouding it.,In Transkei, I witnessed a rite of passage into manhood, of the Xhosa tribe.,Teenage boys lived in isolation, their bodies covered with white clay.,After several weeks, they washed off the white,and took on the full responsibilities of men.,It was a very old ritual that seemed symbolic,of the political struggle that was changing the face of South Africa. 
 Children in Soweto playing on a trampoline.,Elsewhere in Africa there was famine.,In Somalia, the central government collapsed and clan warfare broke out.,Farmers were driven off their land,,and crops and livestock were destroyed or stolen.,Starvation was being used as a weapon of mass destruction --,primitive but extremely effective.,Hundreds of thousands of people were exterminated,,slowly and painfully.,The international community responded with massive humanitarian relief,,and hundreds of thousands of more lives were saved.,American troops were sent to protect the relief shipments,,but they were eventually drawn into the conflict,,and after the tragic battle in Mogadishu, they were withdrawn.,In southern Sudan, another civil war saw similar use of starvation,as a means of genocide. 
 Again, international NGOs, united under the umbrella of the U.N.,,staged a massive relief operation and thousands of lives were saved.,I'm a witness, and I want my testimony to be honest and uncensored.,I also want it to be powerful and eloquent,,and to do as much justice as possible,to the experience of the people I'm photographing.,This man was in an NGO feeding center,,being helped as much as he could be helped.,He literally had nothing. He was a virtual skeleton,,yet he could still summon the courage and the will to move.,He had not given up, and if he didn't give up,,how could anyone in the outside world ever dream of losing hope?,In 1994, after three months of covering the South African election,,I saw the inauguration of Nelson Mandela,,and it was the most uplifting thing I've ever seen.,It exemplified the best that humanity has to offer.,The next day I left for Rwanda,,and it was like taking the express elevator to hell. 
 This man had just been liberated from a Hutu death camp.,He allowed me to photograph him for quite a long time,,and he even turned his face toward the light,,as if he wanted me to see him better.,I think he knew what the scars on his face would say to the rest of the world.,This time, maybe confused or discouraged,by the military disaster in Somalia,,the international community remained silent,,and somewhere around 800,000 people were slaughtered,by their own countrymen -- sometimes their own neighbors --,using farm implements as weapons. 
 Perhaps because a lesson had been learned,by the weak response to the war in Bosnia,and the failure in Rwanda,,when Serbia attacked Kosovo,,international action was taken much more decisively.,NATO forces went in, and the Serbian army withdrew.,Ethnic Albanians had been murdered,,their farms destroyed and a huge number of people forcibly deported.,They were received in refugee camps,set up by NGOs in Albania and Macedonia.,The imprint of a man who had been burned inside his own home.,The image reminded me of a cave painting,,and echoed how primitive we still are in so many ways. 
 Between 1995 and '96, I covered the first two wars,in Chechnya from inside Grozny.,This is a Chechen rebel on the front line against the Russian army.,The Russians bombarded Grozny constantly for weeks,,killing mainly the civilians who were still trapped inside.,I found a boy from the local orphanage,wandering around the front line.,My work has evolved from being concerned mainly with war,to a focus on critical social issues as well.,After the fall of Ceausescu, I went to Romania,and discovered a kind of gulag of children,,where thousands of orphans were being kept in medieval conditions.,Ceausescu had imposed a quota,on the number of children to be produced by each family,,thereby making women's bodies an instrument of state economic policy.,Children who couldn't be supported by their families,were raised in government orphanages.,Children with birth defects were labeled incurables,,and confined for life to inhuman conditions. 
 As reports began to surface, again international aid went in.,Going deeper into the legacy of the Eastern European regimes,,I worked for several months on a story about the effects of industrial pollution,,where there had been no regard for the environment,or the health of either workers or the general population.,An aluminum factory in Czechoslovakia,was filled with carcinogenic smoke and dust,,and four out of five workers came down with cancer. 
 After the fall of Suharto in Indonesia,,I began to explore conditions of poverty,in a country that was on its way towards modernization.,I spent a good deal of time with a man,who lived with his family on a railway embankment,and had lost an arm and a leg in a train accident.,When the story was published, unsolicited donations poured in.,A trust fund was established,,and the family now lives in a house in the countryside,and all their basic necessities are taken care of.,It was a story that wasn't trying to sell anything.,Journalism had provided a channel,for people's natural sense of generosity, and the readers responded.,I met a band of homeless children who'd come to Jakarta from the countryside,,and ended up living in a train station.,By the age of 12 or 14, they'd become beggars and drug addicts.,The rural poor had become the urban poor,,and in the process, they'd become invisible. 
 These heroin addicts in detox in Pakistan,reminded me of figures in a play by Beckett:,isolated, waiting in the dark, but drawn to the light.,Agent Orange was a defoliant used during the Vietnam War,to deny cover to the Vietcong and the North Vietnamese army.,The active ingredient was dioxin, an extremely toxic chemical,that was sprayed in vast quantities,,and whose effects passed through the genes to the next generation.,In 2000, I began documenting global health issues,,concentrating first on AIDS in Africa.,I tried to tell the story through the work of caregivers.,I thought it was important to emphasize that people were being helped,,whether by international NGOs or by local grassroots organizations. 
 So many children have been orphaned by the epidemic,that grandmothers have taken the place of parents,,and a lot of children had been born with HIV.,A hospital in Zambia.,I began documenting the close connection,between HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis.,This is an MSF hospital in Cambodia.,My pictures can play a supporting role to the work of NGOs,by shedding light on the critical social problems they're trying to deal with.,I went to Congo with MSF,,and contributed to a book and an exhibition,that focused attention on a forgotten war,in which millions of people have died,,and exposure to disease without treatment is used as a weapon.,A malnourished child being measured,as part of the supplemental feeding program. 
 In the fall of 2004 I went to Darfur.,This time I was on assignment for a magazine,,but again worked closely with MSF.,The international community still hasn't found a way,to create the pressure necessary to stop this genocide.,An MSF hospital in a camp for displaced people.,I've been working on a long project on crime and punishment in America.,This is a scene from New Orleans.,A prisoner on a chain gang in Alabama,was punished by being handcuffed to a post in the midday sun.,This experience raised a lot of questions,,among them questions about race and equality,and for whom in our country opportunities and options are available.,In the yard of a chain gang in Alabama. 
 I didn't see either of the planes hit,,and when I glanced out my window, I saw the first tower burning,,and I thought it might have been an accident.,A few minutes later when I looked again,and saw the second tower burning, I knew we were at war.,In the midst of the wreckage at Ground Zero, I had a realization.,I'd been photographing in the Islamic world since 1981 --,not only in the Middle East, but also in Africa, Asia and Europe.,At the time I was photographing in these different places,,I thought I was covering separate stories,,but on 9/11 history crystallized, and I understood,I'd actually been covering a single story for more than 20 years,,and the attack on New York was its latest manifestation. 
 The central commercial district of Kabul, Afghanistan,at the end of the civil war,,shortly before the city fell to the Taliban.,Land mine victims being helped,at the Red Cross rehab center being run by Alberto Cairo.,A boy who lost a leg to a leftover mine.,I'd witnessed immense suffering in the Islamic world,from political oppression, civil war, foreign invasions, poverty, famine.,I understood that in its suffering,,the Islamic world had been crying out. Why weren't we listening?,A Taliban fighter shot during a battle,as the Northern Alliance entered the city of Kunduz.,When war with Iraq was imminent,,I realized the American troops would be very well covered,,so I decided to cover the invasion from inside Baghdad.,A marketplace was hit by a mortar shell,that killed several members of a single family.,A day after American forces entered Baghdad,,a company of Marines began rounding up bank robbers,and were cheered on by the crowds --,a hopeful moment that was short lived. 
 For the first time in years,,Shi'ites were allowed to make the pilgrimage,to Karbala to observe Ashura,,and I was amazed by the sheer number of people,and how fervently they practiced their religion.,A group of men march through the streets cutting themselves with knives.,It was obvious that the Shi'ites were a force to be reckoned with,,and we would do well to understand them and learn how to deal with them.,Last year I spent several months documenting our wounded troops,,from the battlefield in Iraq all the way home. 
 This is a helicopter medic giving CPR,to a soldier who had been shot in the head.,Military medicine has become so efficient,that the percentage of troops who survive after being wounded,is much higher in this war than in any other war in our history.,The signature weapon of the war is the IED,,and the signature wound is severe leg damage.,After enduring extreme pain and trauma,,the wounded face a grueling physical,and psychological struggle in rehab.,The spirit they displayed was absolutely remarkable.,I tried to imagine myself in their place,,and I was totally humbled by their courage and determination,in the face of such catastrophic loss.,Good people had been put in a very bad situation for questionable results.,One day in rehab someone, started talking about surfing,and all these guys who'd never surfed before said, "Hey, let's go.",And they went surfing. 
 Photographers go to the extreme edges of human experience,to show people what's going on.,Sometimes they put their lives on the line,,because they believe your opinions and your influence matter.,They aim their pictures at your best instincts,,generosity, a sense of right and wrong,,the ability and the willingness to identify with others,,the refusal to accept the unacceptable.,My TED wish:,there's a vital story that needs to be told,,and I wish for TED to help me gain access to it,and then to help me come up with innovative and exciting ways,to use news photography in the digital era.,Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I got a visit almost exactly a year ago,,a little over a year ago, from a very senior person at the Department of Defense.,Came to see me and said, "1,600 of the kids that we've sent out,have come back missing at least one full arm.,Whole arm. Shoulder disarticulation.,And we're doing the same thing we did for -- more or less,,that we've done since the Civil War, a stick and a hook.,And they deserve more than that.",And literally, this guy sat in my office in New Hampshire and said,,"I want you to give me something that we can put on these kids,that'll pick up a raisin or a grape off a table,,they'll be able to put it in their mouth without destroying either one,,and they'll be able to know the difference without looking at it.",You know, had efferent, afferent, and haptic response. 
 He finishes explaining that, and I'm waiting for the big 300 pound paper proposal,,and he said, "That's what I want from you.",I said, "Look, you're nuts. That technology's just not available right now.,And it can't be done.,Not in an envelope of a human arm,,with 21 degrees of freedom, from your shoulder to your fingertips.",He said, "About two dozen of these 1,600 kids have come back bilateral.,You think it's bad to lose one arm?,That's an inconvenience compared to having both of them gone.",I got a day job,,and my nights and weekends are already filled up with things like,,let's supply water to the world, and power to the world, and educate all the kids,,which, Chris, I will not talk about. I don't need another mission. 
 I keep thinking about these kids with no arms.,He says to me, "We've done some work around the country.,We've got some pretty amazing neurology and other people.",I said, "I'll take a field trip, I'll go see what you got.",Over the next month I visited lots of places, some out here, around the country,,found the best of the best.,I went down to Washington. I saw these guys, and said,,"I did what you asked me. I looked at what's out there.,I still think you're nuts. But not as nuts as I thought." 
 I put a team together, a little over 13 months ago,,got up to 20 some-odd people.,We said, we're going to build a device that does what he wants.,We have 14 out of the 21 degrees of freedom;,you don't need the ones in the last two fingers.,We put this thing together.,A couple of weeks ago we took it down to Walter Reed,,which is unfortunately more in the news these days.,We showed it to a bunch of guys.,One guy who described himself as being lucky,,because he lost his left arm, and he's a righty.,He sat at a table with seven or eight of these other guys.,Said he was lucky, because he had his good arm,,and then he pushed himself back from the table. He had no legs.,These kids have attitudes that you just can't believe. 
 So I'm going to show you now, without the skin on it,,a 30-second piece, and then I'm done.,But understand what you're looking at,we made small enough to fit on a 50th percentile female,,so that we could put it in any of these people.,It's going to go inside something that we use in CAT scans and,MRIs of whatever is their good arm,,to make silicon rubber, then coat it, and paint it in 3D --,exact mirror image of their other limb.,So, you won't see all the really cool stuff that's in this series elastic set of 14 actuators,,each one which has its own capability to sense temperature and pressure.,It also has a pneumatic cuff that holds it on,,so the more they put themselves under load, the more it attaches.,They take the load off, and it becomes, again, compliant.,I'm going to show you a guy doing a couple of simple things with this,that we demonstrated in Washington. Can we look at this thing? 
 Watch the fingers grab. The thumb comes up. Wrist.,This weighs 6.9 pounds.,Going to scratch his nose.,It's got 14 active degrees of freedom.,Now he's going to pick up a pen with his opposed thumb and index finger.,Now he's going to put that down, pick up a piece of paper,,rotate all the degrees of freedom in his hand and wrist, and read it.,(Applause)I want to help you re-perceive what philanthropy is,,what it could be,,and what your relationship to it is.,And in doing that, I want to offer you a vision,,an imagined future, if you will,,of how, as the poet Seamus Heaney has put it,,"Once in a lifetime,the longed-for tidal wave of justice can rise up,,and hope and history rhyme." 
 I want to start with these word pairs here.,We all know which side of these we'd like to be on.,When philanthropy was reinvented a century ago,,when the foundation form was actually invented,,they didn't think of themselves on the wrong side of these either.,In fact they would never have thought of themselves,as closed and set in their ways,,as slow to respond to new challenges,,as small and risk-averse.,And in fact they weren't. They were reinventing charity in those times,,what Rockefeller called "the business of benevolence.",But by the end of the 20th century,,a new generation of critics and reformers,had come to see philanthropy just this way. 
 The thing to watch for,as a global philanthropy industry comes about --,and that's exactly what is happening --,is how the aspiration is to flip,these old assumptions,,for philanthropy to become open and big,and fast and connected, in service of the long term.,This entrepreneurial energy,is emerging from many quarters.,And it's driven and propelled forward by new leaders, like many of the people here,,by new tools, like the ones we've seen here,,and by new pressures. 
 I've been following this change for quite a while now, and participating in it.,This report is our main public report.,What it tells is the story of how today,actually could be as historic,as 100 years ago.,What I want to do is share some of the coolest things,that are going on with you.,And as I do that, I'm not going to dwell much,on the very large philanthropy that everybody already knows about --,the Gates or the Soros or the Google.,Instead, what I want to do,is talk about the philanthropy of all of us:,the democratization of philanthropy.,This is a moment in history when the average person,has more power than at any time. 
 What I'm going to do is look at five categories of experiments,,each of which challenges an old assumption of philanthropy.,The first is mass collaboration, represented here by Wikipedia.,Now, this may surprise you.,But remember, philanthropy is about giving of time and talent, not just money.,Clay Shirky, that great chronicler of everything networked,,has captured the assumption that this challenges,in such a beautiful way.,He said, "We have lived in this world,where little things are done for love,and big things for money.,Now we have Wikipedia.,Suddenly big things can be done for love." 
 Watch, this spring, for Paul Hawken's new book --,Author and entrepreneur many of you may know about.,The book is called "Blessed Unrest.",And when it comes out, a series of wiki sites,under the label WISER, are going to launch at the same time.,WISER stands for World Index,for Social and Environmental Responsibility.,WISER sets out to document, link and empower,what Paul calls the largest movement,,and fastest-growing movement in human history:,humanity's collective immune response,to today's threats.,Now, all of these big things for love -- experiments --,aren't going to take off.,But the ones that do,are going to be the biggest, the most open,,the fastest, the most connected form of philanthropy in human history. 
 Second category is online philanthropy marketplaces.,This is, of course, to philanthropy,what eBay and Amazon are to commerce.,Think of it as peer-to-peer philanthropy.,And this challenges yet another assumption,,which is that organized philanthropy is only for the very wealthy.,Take a look, if you haven't, at DonorsChoose.,Omidyar Network has made a big investment in DonorsChoose.,It's one of the best known of these new marketplaces,where a donor can go straight into a classroom,and connect with what a teacher says they need.,Take a look at Changing the Present,,started by a TEDster, next time you need a wedding present or a holiday present.,GiveIndia is for a whole country.,And it goes on and on. 
 The third category is represented by Warren Buffet,,which I call aggregated giving.,It's not just that Warren Buffet was so amazingly generous,in that historic act last summer.,It's that he challenged another assumption,,that every giver should have his or her own,fund or foundation.,There are now, today, so many new funds,that are aggregating giving and investing,,bringing together people,around a common goal, to think bigger.,One of the best known is Acumen Fund, led by Jacqueline Novogratz,,a TEDster who got a big boost here at TED.,But there are many others: New Profit in Cambridge,,New School's Venture Fund in Silicon Valley,,Venture Philanthropy Partners in Washington,,Global Fund for Women in San Francisco.,Take a look at these.,These funds are to philanthropy,what venture capital, private equity, and eventually mutual funds,are to investing,,but with a twist --,because often a community forms around these funds,,as it has at Acumen and other places. 
 Now, imagine for a second,these first three types of experiments:,mass collaboration, online marketplaces, aggregated giving.,And understand how they help us re-perceive,what organized philanthropy is.,It's not about foundations necessarily; it's about the rest of us.,And imagine the mash-up, if you will, of these things, in the future,,when these things come together in the experiments of the future --,imagine that somebody puts up, say,,100 million dollars,for an inspiring goal --,there were 21 gifts of 100 million dollars or more in the US last year,,not out of the question --,but only puts it up if it's matched,by millions of small gifts from around the globe,,thereby engaging lots of people,,and building visibility and engaging people,in the goal that's stated. 
 I'm going to look quickly at the fourth and fifth categories,,which are innovation, competitions and social investing.,They're betting a visible competition, a prize,,can attract talent and money to some of the most difficult issues,,and thereby speed the solution.,This tackles yet another assumption,,that the giver and the organization is at the center,,as opposed to putting the problem at the center.,You can look to these innovators,to help us especially with things that require,technological or scientific solution. 
 That leaves the final category, social investing,,which is really, anyway, the biggest of them all,,represented here by Xigi.net.,And this, of course, tackles the biggest assumption of all,,that business is business,,and philanthropy is the vehicle of people who want to create change in the world.,Xigi is a new community site,that's built by the community,,linking and mapping this new social capital market.,It lists already 1,000 entities,that are offering debt and equity for social enterprise.,So we can look to these innovators,to help us remember,that if we can leverage even a small amount of the capital,that seeks a return,,the good that can be driven could be astonishing. 
 Now, what's really interesting here,is that we're not thinking our way,into a new way of acting;,we're acting our way into a new way of thinking.,Philanthropy is reorganizing itself,before our very eyes.,And even though all of the experiments and all of the big givers,don't yet fulfill this aspiration,,I think this is the new zeitgeist:,open, big, fast, connected,,and, let us also hope, long.,We have got to realize that it is going to take a long time to do these things.,If we don't develop the stamina to stick with things --,whatever it is you pick, stick with it --,all of this stuff is just going to be, you know, a fad. 
 But I'm really hopeful.,And I'm hopeful because it's not only philanthropy,that's reorganizing itself,,it's also whole other portions of the social sector,,and of business,,that are busy challenging "business as usual.",And everywhere I go, including here at TED,,I feel that there is a new moral hunger,that is growing.,What we're seeing is people really wrestling,to describe what is this new thing that's happening.,Words like "philanthrocapitalism,",and "natural capitalism," and "philanthroentrepreneur,",and "venture philanthropy.",We don't have a language for it yet.,Whatever we call it,,it's new, it's beginning,,and I think it's gong to quite significant. 
 And that's where my imagined future comes in,,which I am going to call the social singularity.,Many of you will realize that I'm ripping a bit off of the science fiction writer,Vernor Vinge's notion of a technological singularity,,where a number of trends accelerate and converge,and come together to create, really, a shockingly new reality.,It may be that the social singularity,ahead is the one that we fear the most:,a convergence of catastrophes,,of environmental degradation,,of weapons of mass destruction, of pandemics,,of poverty.,That's because,our ability to confront the problems that we face,has not kept pace with our ability to create them.,And as we've heard here,,it is no exaggeration to say,that we hold the future of our civilization in our hands,as never before. 
 The question is, is there a positive social singularity?,Is there a frontier for us,of how we live together?,Our future doesn't have to be imagined.,We can create a future where hope and history rhyme.,But we have a problem.,Our experience to date, both individually and collectively,,hasn't prepared us for what we're going to need to do,,or who we're going to need to be.,We are going to need,a new generation of citizen leaders,willing to commit ourselves to growing and changing and learning,as rapidly as possible.,That's why I have one last thing I want to show you. 
 This is a photograph taken about 100 years ago,of my grandfather and great-grandfather.,This is a newspaper publisher and a banker.,And they were great community leaders.,And, yes, they were great philanthropists.,I keep this photograph close by to me --,it's in my office --,because I've always felt a mystical connection to these two men,,both of whom I never knew.,And so, in their honor,,I want to offer you this blank slide.,And I want you to imagine,that this a photograph of you.,And I want you to think about the community,that you want to be part of creating.,Whatever that means to you.,And I want you to imagine,that it's 100 years from now,,and your grandchild, or great-grandchild,,or niece or nephew or god-child,,is looking at this photograph of you.,What is the story you most want for them to tell?,Thank you very much.,(Applause)Welcome to Africa! Or rather, I should say, welcome home.,Because this is where it all really began, isn't it?,Looking at fossils dating back several millions of years --,it all points to evidence that life,for the human species as we know it began right here.,We are on an amazing journey the next four days.,You're going to hear stories of "Africa: The Next Chapter.",Fantastic tales, anecdotes from speakers.,But I want to turn that upside down for a moment,,and get something out on the table and clear the air so to say.,What's the worst thing you've ever heard about Africa?,And this is not a rhetorical question.,I actually want answers from you.,Go for it! The worst.,Famine.,Corruption.,More.,Genocide.,AIDS.,Slavery.,That's enough. 
 We've all heard these things.,But this is about Africa, the story we have not heard.,The stories that we want to know,,and the stories that do exist about positive tales.,A part of my talk is going to be about investment opportunities,that exist on this continent,,to separate the rhetoric from the reality, the fact from the fiction.,To go to the actual data and statistics that exist,about the actual things that are happening on the ground,that make Africa a realistic investment opportunity and option for you.,So let's get going because Africa,,to some degree, is on a turnaround.,A turnaround in terms of how it manages its image,,and how it takes control of its own destiny.,And turnarounds are part and parcel,of what I have focused on for most of my professional career.,And it all started almost a decade ago,,as a young consultant at McKinsey & Company,at their first African office in Johannesburg. 
 And there we worked with leading CEOs,on African issues, and African companies on turnarounds,,making the companies not just the best in Africa,but the best globally.,But I really formalized this focus on turnarounds,when I was completing my MBA in the United States.,It all began with a fantastic phone call.,It was from Rosabeth Moss Kanter,,Harvard Business School guru and a professor of mine.,And she said, "I want to write a case, Euvin --,a case on a public-sector leader,that has lessons for the corporate world.",And the leader that came to mind was Nelson Mandela.,Because Nelson Mandela, as he took over power,as the first democratically-elected president of South Africa,,faced a situation of a country,that could have slid into the abyss of chaos.,But he started the country on a path of a positive cycle. 
 Now the case, "Nelson Mandela: Change Leader,",became part of the research base for a chapter,in Rosabeth's new book called "Confidence.",And "Confidence" became a New York Times bestseller,and topped Business Week's hardcover bestseller list.,And why I tell you this story is because later, when I was interviewed,on SABC Africa, on a pan-African broadcast, they asked,,"What is your key lesson, or the key thing you enjoy the most?" --,because it was a huge privilege to be part of such a project.,The lesson from that was that it was Africa -- an African story --,that was used to share news with the rest of the world,of what the benchmark can be for corporate turnarounds.,Africa was being used as a success story! 
 So I want to share with you a personal story,about a turnaround or a transformation.,And that has to do with me,because in 1994, I packed a few things into a backpack,and headed off for a year of travel,in the middle of my university career.,You should have seen my parents' reaction! 
 (Laughter) 
 But very soon, I found myself from the southern part of Africa,,in South Africa -- at the very north, in Egypt.,And I sought out the most remote places.,I went to the Siwa Oasis. That was one of my stops.,And the Siwa Oasis is famous for several things,,but the key thing is that it was the place,that Alexander the Great went to,when he wanted to find out what his destiny had in store for him.,And legend has it that Alexander trekked through this desert.,Half his battalion was wiped out in the sandstorm.,And myth says that he had an audience with the oracle,,and it foretold his destiny of greatness.,This was 300 BC.,So Africa had long been seen as a place to go to for answers. 
 Now, the thing I remember about Siwa,was the magical view of the sky at night.,With no natural light source, Siva is one of these amazing places,that when you look up you see a perfect tapestry.,Fast forward to 2002.,I'm sitting in Cambridge, Massachusetts,at the Healthcare Development Conference.,And I see the same picture, but from the opposite side.,A satellite picture looking down at the earth.,And it was that picture that made such a profound impact on me,because I'll never forget it. I remember the very moment.,And I wanted to share that image with you of what I saw at that point.,The first thing that I saw was North America at night --,glowing, in all its glory. A warm feeling. Light. 
 And then I saw it -- Africa. Quite literally the "Dark Continent.",And while Africa may be dark,,the thing that brought the message home to me,was that this is the challenge we are facing,,but it's also the opportunity.,Because whilst Africa may be dark -- other than the few specks,that exist north and in the south and other areas --,it's aglow with the light in the hearts,of the millions of people that are there.,Entrepreneurs, dynamic people, people with hope.,It was George Kimble, the geographer, who said,that, "The only thing dark about Africa is our ignorance of it.",So let's start shedding light on this amazing eclectic continent,that has so much to offer. 
 Let's start unpacking it.,Africa is the second-largest continent, a landmass second from Asia.,It also is the second most populated continent,,with 900 million people.,In fact -- coming back to the land mass -- Africa is so big,that you could fit in the continental United States,,China, and the entire Europe into Africa, and still have space.,Africa is home to over 1,000 languages --,2,000 is another estimate that's out there --,with over 2,000 languages and dialects.,But you could say, "Invest in Africa in over 1,000 languages,,and it wouldn't make a difference.",What does the data say?,As an investment banker, I'm in the cross-flow of information,and the changes that are taking place in capital markets.,So I want to share with you some of these bellwether signals, or signs,,and winds of change that are sweeping this continent. 
 So let's start on that.,And let's start at the high level, on the macro-factors.,Inflation, in general, is coming down across Africa --,that's the first sign --,in many countries reaching double-digit figures.,So let's start looking at some of those.,I call it my Z.E.N. cluster.,Zambia: from 2004 to 2006, moves from the 18 percent in inflation,to the nine percent.,Egypt: from the 16 percent to about 8.4 percent.,Nigeria: a similar situation,,from the 16 percent to the eight percent. Single digits.,More fascinating, you have other countries -- South Africa,,Mauritius, Namibia -- all in single digits.,But that's just part of the story. You have a similar trend with currencies --,currencies going through an extreme time of stability.,But that's looking at the big picture.,And the first myth to dispel is that Africa is not a country.,It's made up -- 
 (Applause) 
 It's made up of 53 different countries.,So the very definition -- to say "invest in Africa" is a no-go.,It's meaningless.,Each country has a unique value proposition.,You can make money, you can lose money in Africa.,But opportunities, boy oh boy, they exist.,And this is what today is about --,it's about discussing those very opportunities.,So let's start getting into the countries,and into the specific material and data.,I was recently elected, as Emeka mentioned,,as the President of the South African Chamber of Commerce in America.,And I'm very proud and happy to be in that role,because it is a fascinating position to be in.,To hear this dialogue that's just increasing in tenor and velocity,,of decisions about trade and companies wanting to come.,So the first port of call: let's talk a little bit about South Africa.,But not the South Africa we always talk about --,the gold, the minerals, the First World infrastructure --,a bit about the other side of it. 
 For example, South Africa was recently voted as the top destination,for the top 1,000 UK companies for offshore call-centers.,Same language, timeline, et cetera. Makes sense.,Other headlines that have recently reached South Africa,were Bain Capital and KKR, the big boys of private equity.,Headline in South Africa: "They have landed." Quite ominous.,But what were they there for? To acquire assets.,Bing Capital's acquisition of Edcon, a large retailer, is testimony,to the confidence they are starting to place in the economy.,Because it is actually a long-term play.,Being a retailer, it is a play on the belief,that this middle-class that's growing will continue to grow,,that the boom and the confidence in consumer spending will continue.,But the story of Africa, and my focus, is beyond South Africa,because there's so much happening.,Undoubtedly, Nigeria is clearly a hot spot.,Challenges -- and we will hear a lot about Nigeria in these four days. 
 But looking at Goldman Sachs' work -- we had the famous BRIC Report.,The new report, "The Next Eleven," highlights that by 2020,Nigeria is going to be amongst the top 10 economies in the world.,It's an investment opportunity. Think about that.,Is anyone -- our banks, our investors --,seriously thinking about going to Nigeria?,If you haven't, why not?,What's going on in Nigeria? A couple of things.,I want to talk about it from the perspective of capital markets.,Bellwether signs again.,Guarantee Trust Bank recently issued the first Euro Bond,out of Africa, and this excludes South Africa.,But the first Eurobond, the raising of international capital,offshore, off its own balance sheet,,without any sovereign backing --,that is an indication of the confidence that is taking place in that economy.,Without any sovereign backing,,a Nigerian company raising capital offshore.,It's just a sign of things to come. 
 Looking at the oil industry, Africa provides 18 percent,of the U.S.'s oil supply, with the Middle East just 16 percent.,It's an important strategic partner.,Let's put Nigeria in perspective.,2.2 to 2.4 million barrels of oil a day --,the same league as Kuwait, the same league as Venezuela.,But with Africa, let's start being careful about this.,And Emeka and I have had these discussions.,We have to move away from what's called "the curse of the commodities.",Because it's not about oil, it's not about commodities.,For Africa to truly be sustainable,,we have to move beyond to other industries. 
 So let's unpack those very quickly,,and I'm going to move through these very, very, very fast,because I can see that clock counting down.,What else is going on there? Egypt.,Egypt is launching a first large industrial zone --,2.8 billion investment.,The announcement just came out the last few weeks.,Close to the Mediterranean, near Alexandria --,textiles, petrochemicals.,It's being managed by a Singaporean-based management company.,So they want to emerge as an industrial powerhouse,across the industries -- away from oil. 
 Let's look at agriculture. Let's look at forestry.,What's going on there?,In Tanzania last week, we had the launch,of the East African Organic Produce Standard.,Again, gathering together farmers, gathering together stakeholders,in East Africa to get standards for organic produce. Better prices.,It ties in with small-scale farmers,in terms of no pesticides, no fertilizers.,Again, opportunity to tackle markets to get that higher price.,Uganda: the New Forest Company,,replanting and redeveloping their forests. Why is that important?,As the energy needs are met and electricity is needed [we will need],poles for rolling out electricity.,But here is the sweetener in the deal.,They're going to be tapping into carbon credits.,Let's go back to Nigeria.,The banking sector has undergone tremendous transformation,,from over 80 banks to 25 banks. Strengthening of the system.,But what's going on there? Only 10 percent of the country is banked.,The largest population in Africa is in Nigeria.,135 million-plus people. Think about that.,There are only 700 ATMs in the country. Opportunity. 
 The same for telecoms across the country.,Now let's look at the continent as a whole.,People look at the roads, for example, and they'd say,,"Angola: 90 percent of roads are untarred. Ah, problem!",It's more expensive to transport goods. Prices of goods go up,,inflation is affected.,Nigeria: 70 percent of roads are untarred. Zambia: 80 percent.,In general, more than 50 percent of roads are untarred.,This is an opportunity! Energy needs -- it's an opportunity.,So what are the signs that things are fundamentally changing?,Let's look at the stock markets in Africa.,If I had to ask you, "In 2005 what was the best performing stock market,or stock exchange in the world?" Would Egypt come to mind?,In 2005, the Egyptian stock exchange returned over 145 percent.,What's going on in some of the other countries?,Let's look at some 2006 numbers. Kenya: over 60 percent. Nigeria: over 40 percent.,South Africa: in the 20 percents. High ones.,These are the trends that are taking place.,But in any investment decision, the key question is,,"What is my alternative investment?" 
 Because in Africa today, we are competing globally for capital.,And global capital is agnostic -- it has no loyalties.,There's an overhang of capital in the U.S., and the key is yield pickup.,What Africa is providing is a diversification play,,and also opportunities for yield pickup for the investor,that's aware of what he or she is doing.,Now, when looking at Africa vis-a-vis other things,,and countries in Africa vis-a-vis other things,,comparisons become important.,10 years ago there, were very few countries,that received sovereign ratings from,the Standard & Poors, Moody's and Fitch's.,Today, 16 African countries and growing,have sovereign country ratings. What does this mean?,Take Nigeria again: double B-minus --,in the league of Ukraine and Turkey. Immediately we have a comparison.,The backbone of making investment decisions,for global holders of capital.,Some other figures. South Africa: triple B-plus. Botswana: A-plus.,Bakino Faso: B-minus. And so on. 
 In fact, one of the big agencies is setting up an office in Africa.,Why are they doing that? Because they expect investment to follow.,So one of the big bellwethers,,and one of my final points I want to mention, is,the interesting thing I read is that CNBC,has launched their first African channel. Why is CNBC doing this?,It's the 24-hour rolling African news channel.,They're doing it because they are expecting things to happen.,Me and you, the investments we are going to be making,,the investments the world is going to be making --,that's the 24-hour news channel dedicated to Africa.,So that's the change that's coming down the pipeline. 
 So in conclusion, I want to turn back to that very slide,that made such a deep impact on me all those years ago.,This time [I'll] give you the entire picture that I saw in 2002,,and ask you that when you think about what your role can be in Africa,,think about your journey in terms of bringing light to this continent.,Because there are amazing opportunities available.,And think about the concept of transformation,in the back of your mind,because things can be turned around rather quickly. 
 In 1899, Joseph Conrad released "The Heart of Darkness,",a tale of grim horror along the Congo River.,If one looks carefully, on the Congo River,is one of those bright lights. And that's the very Congo river,generating light -- the old heart of darkness,now generating light with hydro-electric power.,That is a transformation in power of ideas.,So the next step, over the next four days,,is us exploring more of these ideas.,And perchance, if you can always keep this picture in your mind,,that when we convene maybe in the distant future, in 2020,,that picture will look very different.,Thank you. 
 (Applause)Well, first of all, let me thank Emeka -- as a matter of fact,,TED Global -- for putting this conference together.,This conference is going to rank as the most important,in the beginning of the 21st century.,Think African governments will put together a conference like this?,You think the A.U. will put together a conference like this?,Even before they do that they will ask for foreign aid.,I would also like to pay homage and honor to the TED Fellows,June Arunga, James Shikwati, Andrew, and the other TED Fellows.,I call them the Cheetah Generation.,The Cheetah Generation is a new breed of Africans,who brook no nonsense about corruption.,They understand what accountability and democracy is.,They're not going to wait for government to do things for them.,That's the Cheetah Generation,,and Africa's salvation rests on the backs of these Cheetahs.,In contrast, of course, we have the Hippo Generation. 
 (Laughter) 
 The Hippo Generation are the ruling elites.,They are stuck in their intellectual patch.,Complaining about colonialism and imperialism,,they wouldn't move one foot.,If you ask them to reform the economies,,they're not going to reform it,because they benefit from the rotten status quo.,Now, there are a lot of Africans who are very angry,,angry at the condition of Africa.,Now, we're talking about a continent that is not poor.,It is rich in mineral resources, natural mineral resources.,But the mineral wealth of Africa is not being utilized,to lift its people out of poverty.,That's what makes a lot of Africans very angry.,And in a way, Africa is more than a tragedy, in more ways than one.,There's another enduring tragedy, and that tragedy is that,there are so many people, so many governments,,so many organizations who want to help the people in Africa.,They don't understand.,Now, we're not saying don't help Africa.,Helping Africa is noble.,But helping Africa has been turned into a theater of the absurd.,It's like the blind leading the clueless. 
 (Laughter) 
 There are certain things that we need to recognize.,Africa's begging-bowl leaks.,Did you know that 40 percent of the wealth created in Africa,is not invested here in Africa?,It's taken out of Africa.,That's what the World Bank says.,Look at Africa's begging-bowl.,It leaks horribly.,There are people who think that we should pour more money,,more aid into this bowl which leaks.,What are the leakages?,Corruption alone costs Africa 148 billion dollars a year.,Yes, put that aside.,Capital flight out of Africa, 80 billion a year.,Put that aside.,Let's take food imports.,Every year Africa spends 20 billion dollars to import food.,Just add that up, all these leakages.,That's far more than the 50 billion Tony Blair wants to raise for Africa.,Now, back in the 1960s Africa not only fed itself,,it also exported food.,Not anymore. 
 We know that something has gone fundamentally wrong.,You know it, I know it, but let's not waste our time,talking about these mistakes because we'll spend all day here.,Let's move on, and flip over to the next chapter,,and that's what this conference is all about -- the next chapter.,The next chapter begins with first of all, asking ourselves,this fundamental question,,"Whom do we want to help in Africa?",There is the people, and then there is the government or leaders.,Now, the previous speaker before me,,Idris Mohammed, indicated that,we've had abysmal leadership in Africa.,That characterization, in my view, is even more charitable. 
 (Laughter) 
 I belong to an Internet discussion forum,,an African Internet discussion forum,,and I asked them, I said, "Since 1960, we've had exactly,204 African heads of state, since 1960.",And I asked them to name me just 20 good leaders,,just 20 good leaders --,you may want to take this leadership challenge yourself.,I asked them to name me just 20.,Everybody mentioned Nelson Mandela, of course.,Kwame Nkrumah, Nyerere, Kenyatta -- somebody mentioned Idi Amin. 
 (Laughter) 
 I let that pass. 
 (Laughter) 
 My point is, they couldn't go beyond 15.,Even if they had been able to name me 20,,what does that tell you?,20 out of 204 means that the vast majority,of the African leaders failed their people.,And if you look at them, the slate of the post-colonial leaders --,an assortment of military fufu heads,,Swiss-bank socialists, crocodile liberators, vampire elites,,quack revolutionaries. 
 (Applause) 
 Now, this leadership is a far cry from the traditional leaders,that Africans have known for centuries.,The second false premise that we make,when we're trying to help Africa,is that sometimes we think that there is something called,a government in Africa that cares about its people,,serves the interests of the people, and represents the people.,There is one particular quote -- a Lesotho chief once said,that "Here in Lesotho, we've got two problems:,rats and the government." 
 (Laughter) 
 What you and I understand as a government,doesn't exist in many African countries.,In fact, what we call our governments are vampire states.,Vampires because they suck,the economic vitality out of their people.,Government is the problem in Africa.,A vampire state is the government --,(Applause),-- which has been hijacked by a phalanx of bandits and crooks,who use the instruments of state power to enrich themselves,,their cronies, and tribesmen and exclude everybody else.,The richest people in Africa are heads-of-state and ministers,,and quite often the chief bandit is the head-of-state himself.,Where do they get their money?,By creating wealth?,No.,By raking it off the backs of their suffering people.,That's not wealth creation. It's wealth redistribution. 
 The third fundamental issue that we have to recognize,is that if we want to help the African people,,we must know where the African people are.,Take any African economy.,An African economy can be broken up into three sectors.,There is the modern sector, there is the informal sector,and the traditional sector.,The modern sector is the abode of the elites.,It's the seat of government.,In many African countries the modern sector is lost.,It's dysfunctional.,It is a meretricious fandango of imported systems,,which the elites themselves don't understand.,That is the source of many of Africa's problems,where the struggles for political power emanate,and then spill over onto the informal and the traditional sector,,claiming innocent lives. 
 Now the modern sector, of course,,is where a lot of the development aid and resources went into.,More than 80 percent of Ivory Coast's development,went into the modern sector.,The other sectors, the informal and the traditional sectors,,are where you find the majority of the African people,,the real people in Africa. That's where you find them.,Now, obviously it makes common sense,that if you want to help the people, you go where the people are.,But that's not what we did.,As a matter of fact,,we neglected the informal and the traditional sectors.,Now, traditional sector is where Africa produces its agriculture,,which is one of the reasons why Africa can't feed itself,,and that's why it must import food. 
 All right, you cannot develop Africa by ignoring,the informal and the traditional sectors.,And you can't develop the informal and the traditional sectors,without an operational understanding of how these two sectors work.,These two sectors, let me describe to you,,have their own indigenous institutions.,First one is the political system.,Traditionally, Africans hate governments. They hate tyranny.,If you look into their traditional systems,,Africans organize their states in two types.,The first one belongs to those ethnic societies,who believe that the state was necessarily tyrannous,,so they didn't want to have anything to do,with any centralized authority.,These societies are the Ibo, the Somali, the Kikuyus,,for example. They have no chiefs. 
 The other ethnic groups, which did have chiefs,,made sure that they surrounded the chiefs,with councils upon councils upon councils,to prevent them from abusing their power.,In Ashanti tradition, for example,,the chief cannot make any decision,without the concurrence of the council of elders.,Without the council the chief can't pass any law,,and if the chief doesn't govern according to the will of the people,he will be removed.,If not, the people will abandon the chief,,go somewhere else and set up a new settlement.,And even if you look in ancient African empires,,they were all organized around one particular principle --,the confederacy principle,,which is characterized by a great deal of devolution of authority,,decentralization of power. 
 Now, this is what I have described to you.,This is part of Africa's indigenous political heritage.,Now, compare that to the modern systems,the ruling elites established on Africa.,It is a total far cry.,In the economic system in traditional Africa,,the means of production is privately owned.,It's owned by extended families.,You see, in the West, the basic economic and social unit,is the individual.,The American will say, "I am because I am,,and I can damn well do anything I want, anytime.",The accent is on the "I.",In Africa, the Africans say, "I am, because we are.",The "we" connotes community -- the extended family system.,The extended family system pools its resources together. 
 They own farms. They decide what to do, what to produce.,They don't take any orders from their chiefs.,They decide what to do.,And when they produce their crops, they sell the surplus,on marketplaces.,When they make a profit it is theirs to keep,,not for the chief to sequester it from them.,So, in a nutshell, what we had in traditional Africa,was a free-market system.,There were markets in Africa,before the colonialists stepped foot on the continent.,Timbuktu was one great big market town.,Kano, Salaga -- they were all there.,Even if you go to West Africa, you notice that market activity,in West Africa has always been dominated by women.,So, it's quite appropriate that this section is called,a marketplace.,The market is not alien to Africa. 
 What Africans practiced was a different form of capitalism,,but then after independence, all of a sudden,,markets, capitalism became a western institution,,and the leaders said Africans were ready for socialism.,Nonsense.,And even then, what kind of socialism did they practice?,The socialism that they practiced was a peculiar form of,Swiss-bank socialism,,which allowed the heads of states and the ministers,to rape and plunder Africa's,treasuries for deposit in Switzerland.,That is not the kind of system Africans had known for centuries.,What do we do now?,Go back to Africa's indigenous institutions,,and this is where we charge the Cheetahs to go into the informal sectors,,the traditional sectors.,That's where you find the African people. 
 And I'd like to show you a quick little video,about the informal sector, about the boat-building,that I, myself, tried to mobilize Africans in the Diaspora,to invest in.,Could you please show that?,The men are going fishing in these small boats.,Yes, it's an enterprise.,This is by a local Ghanaian entrepreneur, using his own capital.,He's getting no assistance from the government,,and he's building a second, bigger boat.,A bigger boat will mean more fish will be caught and landed.,It means that he will be able to employ more Ghanaians.,It also means that he will be able to generate wealth.,And then it will have what economists call,external effects on a local economy.,All that you need to do, all that the elites need to do,,is to move this operation into something that is enclosed,so that the operation can be made more efficient. 
 Now, it is not just this informal sector.,There is also traditional medicine.,80 percent of Africans still rely on traditional medicine.,The modern healthcare sector has totally collapsed.,Now, this is an area -- I mean, there is a treasure trove of wealth,in the traditional medicine area.,This is where we need to mobilize Africans,,in the Diaspora especially, to invest in this.,We also need to mobilize Africans in the Diaspora,,not only to go into the traditional sectors,,but to go into agriculture and also to instigate change from within.,We were able to mobilize Ghanaians in the Diaspora,to instigate change in Ghana and bring about democracy in Ghana.,And I know that with the Cheetahs, we can take Africa back,one village at a time.,Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I really am honored to be here, and as Chris said,,it's been over 20 years since I started working in Africa.,My first introduction was at the Abidjan airport on a sweaty, Ivory Coast morning.,I had just left Wall Street, cut my hair to look like Margaret Mead,,given away most everything that I owned,,and arrived with all the essentials --,some poetry, a few clothes, and, of course, a guitar --,because I was going to save the world,,and I thought I would just start with the African continent. 
 But literally within days of arriving I was told, in no uncertain terms,,by a number of West African women, that Africans didn't want saving,,thank you very much, least of all not by me.,I was too young, unmarried, I had no children,,didn't really know Africa, and besides, my French was pitiful.,And so, it was an incredibly painful time in my life,,and yet it really started to give me the humility to start listening. 
 I think that failure can be an incredibly motivating force as well,,so I moved to Kenya and worked in Uganda,,and I met a group of Rwandan women, who asked me, in 1986,,to move to Kigali to help them start the first microfinance institution there.,And I did, and we ended up naming it Duterimbere,,meaning "to go forward with enthusiasm." And while we were doing it,,I realized that there weren't a lot of businesses that were viable,and started by women, and so maybe I should try to run a business, too.,And so I started looking around, and I heard about a bakery,that was run by 20 prostitutes.,And, being a little intrigued, I went to go meet this group,,and what I found was 20 unwed mothers who were trying to survive. 
 And it was really the beginning of my understanding the power of language,,and how what we call people so often distances us from them,,and makes them little.,I also found out that the bakery was nothing like a business,,that, in fact, it was a classic charity run by a well-intentioned person,,who essentially spent 600 dollars a month,to keep these 20 women busy making little crafts and baked goods,,and living on 50 cents a day, still in poverty.,So, I made a deal with the women. I said, "Look, we get rid of the charity side,,and we run this as a business and I'll help you.",They nervously agreed. I nervously started, and, of course,,things are always harder than you think they're going to be. 
 First of all, I thought, well, we need a sales team,,and we clearly aren't the A-Team here,,so let's -- I did all this training.,And the epitome was when I literally marched into the streets,of Nyamirambo, which is the popular quarter of Kigali, with a bucket,,and I sold all these little doughnuts to people,,and I came back, and I was like, "You see?",And the women said, "You know, Jacqueline, who in Nyamirambo is not going to buy,doughnuts out of an orange bucket from a tall American woman?" And like --,(Laughter) -- it's a good point. 
 So then I went the whole American way,,with competitions, team and individual. Completely failed,,but over time, the women learnt to sell on their own way.,And they started listening to the marketplace,,and they came back with ideas for cassava chips, and banana chips,,and sorghum bread, and before you knew it,,we had cornered the Kigali market,,and the women were earning three to four times the national average.,And with that confidence surge, I thought, "Well, it's time to create a real bakery,,so let's paint it." And the women said, "That's a really great idea.",And I said, "Well, what color do you want to paint it?" And they said,,"Well, you choose." And I said, "No, no, I'm learning to listen.,You choose. It's your bakery, your street, your country -- not mine.",But they wouldn't give me an answer.,So, one week, two weeks, three weeks went by,,and finally I said, "Well, how about blue?",And they said, "Blue, blue, we love blue. Let's do it blue.",So, I went to the store, I brought Gaudence, the recalcitrant one of all,,and we brought all this paint and fabric to make curtains,,and on painting day, we all gathered in Nyamirambo,,and the idea was we would paint it white with blue as trim,,like a little French bakery. But that was clearly not as satisfying,as painting a wall of blue like a morning sky. 
 So, blue, blue, everything became blue.,The walls were blue, the windows were blue,,the sidewalk out front was painted blue.,And Aretha Franklin was shouting "R-E-S-P-E-C-T,",the women's hips were swaying,and little kids were trying to grab the paintbrushes, but it was their day.,And at the end of it, we stood across the street,and we looked at what we had done, and I said, "It is so beautiful.",And the women said, "It really is.",And I said, "And I think the color is perfect,",and they all nodded their head, except for Gaudence,,and I said, "What?",And she said, "Nothing." And I said, "What?",And she said, "Well, it is pretty, but, you know, our color, really, it is green." And --,(Laughter) 
 -- I learned then that listening isn't just about patience,,but that when you've lived on charity and dependent your whole life long,,it's really hard to say what you mean.,And, mostly because people never really ask you,,and when they do, you don't really think they want to know the truth.,And so then I learned that listening is not only about waiting,,but it's also learning how better to ask questions. 
 And so, I lived in Kigali for about two and a half years, doing these two things,,and it was an extraordinary time in my life.,And it taught me three lessons,that I think are so important for us today,,and certainly in the work that I do.,The first is that dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth.,As Eleni has said, when people gain income, they gain choice,,and that is fundamental to dignity.,But as human beings, we also want to see each other,,and we want to be heard by each other, and we should never forget that.,The second is that traditional charity and aid,are never going to solve the problems of poverty. 
 I think Andrew pretty well covered that, so I will move to the third point,,which is that markets alone also,are not going to solve the problems of poverty.,Yes, we ran this as a business,,but someone needed to pay the philanthropic support,that came into the training, and the management support, the strategic advice,and, maybe most important of all,,the access to new contacts, networks and new markets.,And so, on a micro level, there's a real role for this combination,of investment and philanthropy.,And on a macro level -- some of the speakers have inferred that,even health should be privatized.,But, having had a father with heart disease,,and realizing that what our family could afford,was not what he should have gotten,,and having a good friend step in to help,,I really believe that all people deserve access to health,at prices they can afford.,I think the market can help us figure that out,,but there's got to be a charitable component,,or I don't think we're going to create the kind of societies we want to live in. 
 And so, it was really those lessons that made me decide to,build Acumen Fund about six years ago.,It's a nonprofit, venture capital fund for the poor,,a few oxymorons in one sentence.,It essentially raises charitable funds from individuals, foundations and corporations,,and then we turn around and we invest equity and loans,in both for-profit and nonprofit entities,that deliver affordable health, housing, energy, clean water,to low income people in South Asia and Africa,,so that they can make their own choices.,We've invested about 20 million dollars in 20 different enterprises,,and have, in so doing, created nearly 20,000 jobs,,and delivered tens of millions of services to people,who otherwise would not be able to afford them. 
 I want to tell you two stories. Both of them are in Africa.,Both of them are about investing in entrepreneurs,who are committed to service, and who really know the markets.,Both of them live at the confluence of public health and enterprise,,and both of them, because they're manufacturers,,create jobs directly, and create incomes indirectly,,because they're in the malaria sector,,and Africa loses about 13 billion dollars a year because of malaria.,And so as people get healthier, they also get wealthier. 
 The first one is called Advanced Bio-Extracts Limited.,It's a company built in Kenya about seven years ago,by an incredible entrepreneur named Patrick Henfrey and his three colleagues.,These are old-hand farmers,who've gone through all the agricultural ups and downs,in Kenya over the last 30 years.,Now, this plant is an Artemisia plant;,it's the basic component for artemisinin,,which is the best-known treatment for malaria.,It's indigenous to China and the Far East,,but given that the prevalence of malaria is here in Africa,,Patrick and his colleagues said, "Let's bring it here,,because it's a high value-add product.",The farmers get three to four times the yields that they would with maize. 
 And so, using patient capital -- money that they could raise early on,,that actually got below market returns,and was willing to go the long haul and be combined,with management assistance, strategic assistance --,they've now created a company where they purchase from 7,500 farmers.,So that's about 50,000 people affected.,And I think some of you may have visited --,these farmers are helped by KickStart and TechnoServe,,who help them become more self-sufficient.,They buy it, they dry it and they bring it to this factory,,which was purchased in part by, again, patient capital from Novartis,,who has a real interest in getting the powder,so that they can make Coartem.,Acumen's been working with ABE for the past year, year and a half,,both on looking at a new business plan,,and what does expansion look like, helping with management support,and helping to do term sheets and raise capital.,And I really understood what patient capital meant emotionally,in the last month or so. Because the company was literally,10 days away from proving that the product they produced,was at the world-quality level needed to make Coartem,,when they were in the biggest cash crisis of their history. 
 And we called all of the social investors we know.,Now, some of these same social investors are really interested in Africa,and understand the importance of agriculture,,and they even helped the farmers.,And even when we explained that if ABE goes away,,all those 7,500 jobs go away too,,we sometimes have this bifurcation between business and the social.,And it's really time we start thinking more creatively about how they can be fused.,So Acumen made not one, but two bridge loans,,and the good news is they did indeed meet world-quality classification and are now,in the final stages of closing a 20-million-dollar round, to move it to the next level,,and I think that this will be one of the more important companies in East Africa. 
 This is Samuel. He's a farmer.,He was actually living in the Kibera slums,when his father called him and told him about Artemisia and the value-add potential.,So he moved back to the farm, and, long story short,,they now have seven acres under cultivation.,Samuel's kids are in private school,,and he's starting to help other farmers in the area also go into Artemisia production --,dignity being more important than wealth. 
 The next one, many of you know.,I talked about it a little at Oxford two years ago,,and some of you visited A to Z manufacturing,,which is one of the great, real companies in East Africa.,It's another one that lives at the confluence of health and enterprise.,And this is really a story about a public-private solution,that has really worked.,It started in Japan. Sumitomo had developed a technology,essentially to impregnate a polyethylene-based fiber with organic insecticide,,so you could create a bed net,,a malaria bed net, that would last five years and not need to be re-dipped. 
 It could alter the vector, but like Artemisia,,it had been produced only in East Asia. And as part of its social responsibility,,Sumitomo said, "Why don't we experiment,with whether we can produce it in Africa, for Africans?",UNICEF came forward and said, "We'll buy most of the nets,,and then we'll give them away, as part of the global fund's,and the U.N.'s commitment to pregnant women and children, for free.",Acumen came in with the patient capital,,and we also helped to identify the entrepreneur,that we would all partner with here in Africa,,and Exxon provided the initial resin. 
 Well, in looking around for entrepreneurs,,there was none better that we could find on earth than Anuj Shah,,in A to Z manufacturing company.,It's a 40-year-old company, it understands manufacturing.,It's gone from socialist Tanzania into capitalist Tanzania,,and continued to flourish. It had about 1,000 employees when we first found it.,And so, Anuj took the entrepreneurial risk here in Africa,to produce a public good that was purchased by the aid establishment,to work with malaria. 
 And, long story short, again, they've been so successful.,In our first year, the first net went off the line in October of 2003.,We thought the hitting-it-out-of-the-box number was 150,000 nets a year.,This year, they are now producing eight million nets a year,,and they employ 5,000 people, 90 percent of whom are women, mostly unskilled.,They're in a joint venture with Sumitomo.,And so, from an enterprise perspective for Africa,,and from a public health perspective, these are real successes. 
 But it's only half the story if we're really looking at solving problems of poverty,,because it's not long-term sustainable.,It's a company with one big customer.,And if avian flu hits, or for any other reason,the world decides that malaria is no longer as much of a priority, everybody loses.,And so, Anuj and Acumen,have been talking about testing the private sector,,because the assumption that the aid establishment has made is that,,look, in a country like Tanzania,,80 percent of the population makes less than two dollars a day.,It costs, at manufacturing point, six dollars to produce these,,and it costs the establishment another six dollars to distribute it,,so the market price in a free market would be about 12 dollars per net.,Most people can't afford that, so let's give it away free.,And we said, "Well, there's another option.,Let's use the market as the best listening device we have, and,understand at what price people would pay for this, so they get the dignity of choice.,We can start building local distribution,,and actually, it can cost the public sector much less." 
 And so we came in with a second round of patient capital to A to Z,,a loan as well as a grant, so that A to Z could play with pricing,and listen to the marketplace, and found a number of things.,One, that people will pay different prices,,but the overwhelming number of people will come forth at one dollar per net,and make a decision to buy it.,And when you listen to them, they'll also have a lot to say,about what they like and what they don't like.,And that some of the channels we thought would work didn't work.,But because of this experimentation and iteration that was allowed,because of the patient capital,,we've now found that it costs about a dollar in the private sector,to distribute, and a dollar to buy the net.,So then, from a policy perspective, when you start with the market,,we have a choice.,We can continue going along at 12 dollars a net, and the customer pays zero,,or we could at least experiment with some of it, to charge one dollar a net,,costing the public sector another six dollars a net,,give the people the dignity of choice, and have a distribution system,that might, over time, start sustaining itself. 
 We've got to start having conversations like this,,and I don't think there's any better way to start than using the market,,but also to bring other people to the table around it.,Whenever I go to visit A to Z, I think of my grandmother, Stella.,She was very much like those women sitting behind the sewing machines.,She grew up on a farm in Austria, very poor,,didn't have very much education.,She moved to the United States, where she met my grandfather,,who was a cement hauler,,and they had nine children. Three of them died as babies.,My grandmother had tuberculosis, and she worked in a sewing machine shop,,making shirts for about 10 cents an hour.,She, like so many of the women I see at A to Z,,worked hard every day, understood what suffering was,,had a deep faith in God, loved her children,and would never have accepted a handout.,But because she had the opportunity of the marketplace,,and she lived in a society that provided the safety,of having access to affordable health and education,,her children and their children were able to live,lives of real purpose and follow real dreams. 
 I look around at my siblings and my cousins -- and as I said,,there are a lot of us --,and I see teachers and musicians, hedge fund managers, designers.,One sister who makes other people's wishes come true.,And my wish, when I see those women, I meet those farmers,,and I think about all the people across this continent,who are working hard every day,,is that they have that sense of opportunity and possibility,,and that they also can believe and get access to services,,so that their children, too, can live those lives of great purpose.,It shouldn't be that difficult.,But what it takes is a commitment from all of us,to essentially refuse trite assumptions,,get out of our ideological boxes.,It takes investing in those entrepreneurs that are committed,to service as well as to success.,It takes opening your arms, both, wide,,and expecting very little love in return,,but demanding accountability,,and bringing the accountability to the table as well.,And most of all, most of all,,it requires that all of us have the courage and the patience,,whether we are rich or poor, African or non-African,,local or diaspora, left or right,,to really start listening to each other.,Thank you.,(Applause)Chris Anderson: William, hi. Good to see you. 
 William Kamkwamba: Thanks. 
 CA: So, we've got a picture, I think? Where is this? 
 WK: This is my home. This is where I live. 
 CA: Where? What country? 
 WK: In Malawi, Kasungu. In Kasungu. Yeah, Mala. 
 CA: OK. Now, you're 19 now? 
 WK: Yeah. I'm 19 years now. 
 CA: Five years ago you had an idea. What was that? 
 WK: I wanted to make a windmill. 
 CA: A windmill? 
 WK: Yeah. 
 CA: What, to power -- for lighting and stuff? 
 WK: Yeah. 
 CA: So what did you do? How did you realize that? 
 WK: After I dropped out of school, I went to library,,and I read a book that would -- "Using Energy,",and I get information about doing the mill.,And I tried, and I made it. 
 (Applause) 
 CA: So you copied -- you exactly copied the design in the book. 
 WK: Ah, no. I just -- 
 CA: What happened? 
 WK: In fact, a design of the windmill that was in the book,,it has got four -- ah -- three blades,,and mine has got four blades. 
 CA: The book had three, yours had four. 
 WK: Yeah. 
 CA: And you made it out of what? 
 WK: I made four blades, just because I want to increase power. 
 CA: OK. 
 WK: Yeah. 
 CA: You tested three, and found that four worked better? 
 WK: Yeah. I test. 
 CA: And what did you make the windmill out of?,What materials did you use? 
 WK: I use a bicycle frame, and a pulley, and plastic pipe, what then pulls -- 
 CA: Do we have a picture of that? Can we have the next slide? 
 WK: Yeah. The windmill. 
 CA: And so, and that windmill, what -- it worked? 
 WK: When the wind blows, it rotates and generates. 
 CA: How much electricity? 
 WK: 12 watts. 
 CA: And so, that lit a light for the house? How many lights? 
 WK: Four bulbs and two radios. 
 CA: Wow. 
 WK: Yeah. 
 (Applause) CA: Next slide --,so who's that? 
 WK: This is my parents, holding the radio. 
 CA: So what did they make of -- that you were 14, 15 at the time --,what did they make of this? They were impressed? 
 WK: Yeah. 
 CA: And so what's your -- what are you going to do with this? 
 WK: Um -- 
 CA: What do you -- I mean -- do you want to build another one? 
 WK: Yeah, I want to build another one --,to pump water and irrigation for crops. 
 CA: So this one would have to be bigger? 
 WK: Yeah. 
 CA: How big? 
 WK: I think it will produce more than 20 the watts. 
 CA: So that would produce irrigation for the entire village? 
 WK: Yeah. 
 CA: Wow. And so you're talking to people here at TED,to get people who might be able to help in some way,to realize this dream? 
 WK: Yeah, if they can help me with materials, yeah. 
 CA: And as you think of your life going forward,,you're 19 now,,do you picture continuing with this dream of working in energy? 
 WK: Yeah. I'm still thinking to work on energy. 
 CA: Wow. William, it's a real honor to have you at the TED conference.,Thank you so much for coming. 
 WK: Thank you. 
 (Applause)I am very, very happy to be amidst some of the most --,the lights are really disturbing my eyes,and they're reflecting on my glasses.,I am very happy and honored to be amidst,very, very innovative and intelligent people.,I have listened to the three previous speakers,,and guess what happened?,Every single thing I planned to say, they have said it here,,and it looks and sounds like I have nothing else to say. 
 (Laughter) 
 But there is a saying in my culture,that if a bud leaves a tree without saying something,,that bud is a young one.,So, I will -- since I am not young and am very old,,I still will say something. 
 We are hosting this conference at a very opportune moment,,because another conference is taking place in Berlin.,It is the G8 Summit.,The G8 Summit proposes that the solution to Africa's problems,should be a massive increase in aid,,something akin to the Marshall Plan.,Unfortunately, I personally do not believe in the Marshall Plan.,One, because the benefits of the Marshall Plan have been overstated.,Its largest recipients were Germany and France,,and it was only 2.5 percent of their GDP.,An average African country receives foreign aid,to the tune of 13, 15 percent of its GDP,,and that is an unprecedented transfer of financial resources,from rich countries to poor countries. 
 But I want to say that there are two things we need to connect.,How the media covers Africa in the West, and the consequences of that.,By displaying despair, helplessness and hopelessness,,the media is telling the truth about Africa, and nothing but the truth.,However, the media is not telling us the whole truth.,Because despair, civil war, hunger and famine,,although they're part and parcel of our African reality,,they are not the only reality.,And secondly, they are the smallest reality. 
 Africa has 53 nations.,We have civil wars only in six countries,,which means that the media are covering only six countries.,Africa has immense opportunities that never navigate,through the web of despair and helplessness,that the Western media largely presents to its audience.,But the effect of that presentation is, it appeals to sympathy.,It appeals to pity. It appeals to something called charity.,And, as a consequence, the Western view,of Africa's economic dilemma is framed wrongly.,The wrong framing is a product of thinking,that Africa is a place of despair.,What should we do with it? We should give food to the hungry.,We should deliver medicines to those who are ill.,We should send peacekeeping troops,to serve those who are facing a civil war.,And in the process, Africa has been stripped of self-initiative. 
 I want to say that it is important to recognize,that Africa has fundamental weaknesses.,But equally, it has opportunities and a lot of potential.,We need to reframe the challenge that is facing Africa,,from a challenge of despair,,which is called poverty reduction,,to a challenge of hope.,We frame it as a challenge of hope, and that is worth creation.,The challenge facing all those who are interested in Africa,is not the challenge of reducing poverty.,It should be a challenge of creating wealth. 
 Once we change those two things --,if you say the Africans are poor and they need poverty reduction,,you have the international cartel of good intentions,moving onto the continent, with what?,Medicines for the poor, food relief for those who are hungry,,and peacekeepers for those who are facing civil war.,And in the process, none of these things really are productive,because you are treating the symptoms, not the causes,of Africa's fundamental problems.,Sending somebody to school and giving them medicines,,ladies and gentlemen, does not create wealth for them.,Wealth is a function of income, and income comes from you finding,a profitable trading opportunity or a well-paying job. 
 Now, once we begin to talk about wealth creation in Africa,,our second challenge will be,,who are the wealth-creating agents in any society?,They are entrepreneurs. [Unclear] told us they are always,about four percent of the population, but 16 percent are imitators.,But they also succeed at the job of entrepreneurship.,So, where should we be putting the money?,We need to put money where it can productively grow.,Support private investment in Africa, both domestic and foreign.,Support research institutions,,because knowledge is an important part of wealth creation. 
 But what is the international aid community doing with Africa today?,They are throwing large sums of money for primary health,,for primary education, for food relief.,The entire continent has been turned into,a place of despair, in need of charity.,Ladies and gentlemen, can any one of you tell me,a neighbor, a friend, a relative that you know,,who became rich by receiving charity?,By holding the begging bowl and receiving alms?,Does any one of you in the audience have that person?,Does any one of you know a country that developed because of,the generosity and kindness of another?,Well, since I'm not seeing the hand,,it appears that what I'm stating is true. 
 (Bono: Yes!) 
 Andrew Mwenda: I can see Bono says he knows the country.,Which country is that? 
 (Bono: It's an Irish land.) 
 (Laughter) 
 (Bono: [unclear]) 
 AM: Thank you very much. But let me tell you this.,External actors can only present to you an opportunity.,The ability to utilize that opportunity and turn it into an advantage,depends on your internal capacity.,Africa has received many opportunities.,Many of them we haven't benefited much.,Why? Because we lack the internal, institutional framework,and policy framework that can make it possible for us,to benefit from our external relations. I'll give you an example. 
 Under the Cotonou Agreement,,formerly known as the Lome Convention,,African countries have been given an opportunity by Europe,to export goods, duty-free, to the European Union market.,My own country, Uganda, has a quota to export 50,000 metric tons,of sugar to the European Union market.,We haven't exported one kilogram yet.,We import 50,000 metric tons of sugar from Brazil and Cuba.,Secondly, under the beef protocol of that agreement,,African countries that produce beef,have quotas to export beef duty-free to the European Union market.,None of those countries, including Africa's most successful nation, Botswana,,has ever met its quota. 
 So, I want to argue today that the fundamental source of Africa's,inability to engage the rest of the world,in a more productive relationship,is because it has a poor institutional and policy framework.,And all forms of intervention need support,,the evolution of the kinds of institutions that create wealth,,the kinds of institutions that increase productivity.,How do we begin to do that, and why is aid the bad instrument?,Aid is the bad instrument, and do you know why?,Because all governments across the world need money to survive.,Money is needed for a simple thing like keeping law and order.,You have to pay the army and the police to show law and order.,And because many of our governments are quite dictatorial,,they need really to have the army clobber the opposition.,The second thing you need to do is pay your political hangers-on.,Why should people support their government?,Well, because it gives them good, paying jobs,,or, in many African countries, unofficial opportunities,to profit from corruption. 
 The fact is no government in the world,,with the exception of a few, like that of Idi Amin,,can seek to depend entirely on force as an instrument of rule.,Many countries in the [unclear], they need legitimacy.,To get legitimacy, governments often need to deliver things like primary education,,primary health, roads, build hospitals and clinics.,If the government's fiscal survival,depends on it having to raise money from its own people,,such a government is driven by self-interest,to govern in a more enlightened fashion.,It will sit with those who create wealth.,Talk to them about the kind of policies and institutions,that are necessary for them to expand a scale and scope of business,so that it can collect more tax revenues from them.,The problem with the African continent,and the problem with the aid industry,is that it has distorted the structure of incentives,facing the governments in Africa.,The productive margin in our governments' search for revenue,does not lie in the domestic economy,,it lies with international donors. 
 Rather than sit with Ugandan -- 
 (Applause) -- 
 rather than sit with Ugandan entrepreneurs,,Ghanaian businessmen, South African enterprising leaders,,our governments find it more productive,to talk to the IMF and the World Bank.,I can tell you, even if you have ten Ph.Ds.,,you can never beat Bill Gates in understanding the computer industry.,Why? Because the knowledge that is required for you to understand,the incentives necessary to expand a business --,it requires that you listen to the people, the private sector actors in that industry. 
 Governments in Africa have therefore been given an opportunity,,by the international community, to avoid building,productive arrangements with your own citizens,,and therefore allowed to begin endless negotiations with the IMF,and the World Bank, and then it is the IMF and the World Bank,that tell them what its citizens need.,In the process, we, the African people, have been sidelined,from the policy-making, policy-orientation, and policy-,implementation process in our countries.,We have limited input, because he who pays the piper calls the tune.,The IMF, the World Bank, and the cartel of good intentions in the world,has taken over our rights as citizens,,and therefore what our governments are doing, because they depend on aid,,is to listen to international creditors rather than their own citizens. 
 But I want to put a caveat on my argument,,and that caveat is that it is not true that aid is always destructive.,Some aid may have built a hospital, fed a hungry village.,It may have built a road, and that road,may have served a very good role.,The mistake of the international aid industry,is to pick these isolated incidents of success,,generalize them, pour billions and trillions of dollars into them,,and then spread them across the whole world,,ignoring the specific and unique circumstances in a given village,,the skills, the practices, the norms and habits,that allowed that small aid project to succeed --,like in Sauri village, in Kenya, where Jeffrey Sachs is working --,and therefore generalize this experience,as the experience of everybody. 
 Aid increases the resources available to governments,,and that makes working in a government the most profitable thing,you can have, as a person in Africa seeking a career.,By increasing the political attractiveness of the state,,especially in our ethnically fragmented societies in Africa,,aid tends to accentuate ethnic tensions,as every single ethnic group now begins struggling to enter the state,in order to get access to the foreign aid pie.,Ladies and gentlemen, the most enterprising people in Africa,cannot find opportunities to trade and to work in the private sector,because the institutional and policy environment is hostile to business.,Governments are not changing it. Why?,Because they don't need to talk to their own citizens.,They talk to international donors.,So, the most enterprising Africans end up going to work for government,,and that has increased the political tensions in our countries,precisely because we depend on aid. 
 I also want to say that it is important for us to,note that, over the last 50 years, Africa has been receiving increasing aid,from the international community,,in the form of technical assistance, and financial aid,,and all other forms of aid.,Between 1960 and 2003, our continent received 600 billion dollars of aid,,and we are still told that there is a lot of poverty in Africa.,Where has all the aid gone? 
 I want to use the example of my own country, called Uganda,,and the kind of structure of incentives that aid has brought there.,In the 2006-2007 budget, expected revenue: 2.5 trillion shillings.,The expected foreign aid: 1.9 trillion.,Uganda's recurrent expenditure -- by recurrent what do I mean?,Hand-to-mouth is 2.6 trillion.,Why does the government of Uganda budget spend 110 percent,of its own revenue?,It's because there's somebody there called foreign aid, who contributes for it.,But this shows you that the government of Uganda,is not committed to spending its own revenue,to invest in productive investments,,but rather it devotes this revenue,to paying structure of public expenditure.,Public administration, which is largely patronage, takes 690 billion.,The military, 380 billion.,Agriculture, which employs 18 percent of our poverty-stricken citizens,,takes only 18 billion.,Trade and industry takes 43 billion.,And let me show you, what does public expenditure --,rather, public administration expenditure -- in Uganda constitute?,There you go. 70 cabinet ministers, 114 presidential advisers,,by the way, who never see the president, except on television. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 And when they see him physically, it is at public functions like this,,and even there, it is him who advises them. 
 (Laughter) 
 We have 81 units of local government.,Each local government is organized like the central government --,a bureaucracy, a cabinet, a parliament,,and so many jobs for the political hangers-on.,There were 56, and when our president wanted to,amend the constitution and remove term limits,,he had to create 25 new districts, and now there are 81.,Three hundred thirty-three members of parliament.,You need Wembley Stadium to host our parliament.,One hundred thirty-four commissions,and semi-autonomous government bodies,,all of which have directors and the cars. And the final thing,,this is addressed to Mr. Bono. In his work, he may help us on this. 
 A recent government of Uganda study found,that there are 3,000 four-wheel drive motor vehicles,at the Minister of Health headquarters.,Uganda has 961 sub-counties, each of them with a dispensary,,none of which has an ambulance.,So, the four-wheel drive vehicles at the headquarters,drive the ministers, the permanent secretaries, the bureaucrats,and the international aid bureaucrats who work in aid projects,,while the poor die without ambulances and medicine. 
 Finally, I want to say that before I came to speak here,,I was told that the principle of TEDGlobal,is that the good speech should be like a miniskirt.,It should be short enough to arouse interest,,but long enough to cover the subject.,I hope I have achieved that. 
 (Laughter) 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I just heard the best joke about Bond Emeruwa.,I was having lunch with him just a few minutes ago,,and a Nigerian journalist comes -- and this will only make sense,if you've ever watched a James Bond movie --,and a Nigerian journalist comes up to him and goes,,"Aha, we meet again, Mr. Bond!",(Laughter),It was great. 
 So, I've got a little sheet of paper here,,mostly because I'm Nigerian and if you leave me alone,,I'll talk for like two hours. 
 I just want to say good afternoon, good evening.,It's been an incredible few days.,It's downhill from now on. I wanted to thank Emeka and Chris.,But also, most importantly, all the invisible people behind TED,that you just see flitting around the whole place,that have made sort of this space for such a diverse and robust conversation.,It's really amazing.,I've been in the audience.,I'm a writer, and I've been watching people with the slide shows,and scientists and bankers, and I've been feeling a bit,like a gangsta rapper at a bar mitzvah.,(Laughter),Like, what have I got to say about all this?,And I was watching Jane [Goodall] yesterday,,and I thought it was really great, and I was watching,those incredible slides of the chimpanzees, and I thought,,"Wow. What if a chimpanzee could talk, you know? What would it say?",My first thought was, "Well, you know, there's George Bush.",But then I thought, "Why be rude to chimpanzees?",I guess there goes my green card.,(Laughter) 
 There's been a lot of talk about narrative in Africa.,And what's become increasingly clear to me is that,we're talking about news stories about Africa;,we're not really talking about African narratives.,And it's important to make a distinction, because if the news is anything to go by,,40 percent of Americans can't -- either can't afford health insurance,or have the most inadequate health insurance,,and have a president who, despite the protest,of millions of his citizens -- even his own Congress --,continues to prosecute a senseless war.,So if news is anything to go by,,the U.S. is right there with Zimbabwe, right?,Which it isn't really, is it?,And talking about war, my girlfriend has this great t-shirt,that says, "Bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity.",It's amazing, isn't it? 
 The truth is, everything we know about America,,everything Americans come to know about being American,,isn't from the news.,I live there.,We don't go home at the end of the day and think,,"Well, I really know who I am now,because the Wall Street Journal says that the Stock Exchange,closed at this many points.",What we know about how to be who we are comes from stories.,It comes from the novels, the movies, the fashion magazines.,It comes from popular culture. 
 In other words, it's the agents of our imagination,who really shape who we are. And this is important to remember,,because in Africa,the complicated questions we want to ask about,what all of this means has been asked,from the rock paintings of the San people,,through the Sundiata epics of Mali, to modern contemporary literature.,If you want to know about Africa, read our literature --,and not just "Things Fall Apart," because that would be like saying,,"I've read 'Gone with the Wind' and so I know everything about America.",That's very important.,There's a poem by Jack Gilbert called "The Forgotten Dialect of the Heart.",He says, "When the Sumerian tablets were first translated,,they were thought to be business records.,But what if they were poems and psalms?,My love is like twelve Ethiopian goats,standing still in the morning light.,Shiploads of thuja are what my body wants to say to your body.,Giraffes are this desire in the dark.",This is important. 
 It's important because misreading is really the chance,for complication and opportunity.,The first Igbo Bible was translated from English,in about the 1800s by Bishop Crowther,,who was a Yoruba.,And it's important to know Igbo is a tonal language,,and so they'll say the word "igwe" and "igwe":,same spelling, one means "sky" or "heaven,",and one means "bicycle" or "iron.",So "God is in heaven surrounded by His angels",was translated as --,[Igbo].,And for some reason, in Cameroon, when they tried,to translate the Bible into Cameroonian patois,,they chose the Igbo version.,And I'm not going to give you the patois translation;,I'm going to make it standard English.,Basically, it ends up as "God is on a bicycle with his angels.",This is good, because language complicates things. 
 You know, we often think that language mirrors,the world in which we live, and I find that's not true.,The language actually makes the world in which we live.,Language is not -- I mean, things don't have,any mutable value by themselves; we ascribe them a value.,And language can't be understood in its abstraction.,It can only be understood in the context of story,,and everything, all of this is story.,And it's important to remember that,,because if we don't, then we become ahistorical.,We've had a lot of -- a parade of amazing ideas here.,But these are not new to Africa.,Nigeria got its independence in 1960.,The first time the possibility for independence was discussed,was in 1922, following the Aba women's market riots.,In 1967, in the middle of the Biafran-Nigerian Civil War,,Dr. Njoku-Obi invented the Cholera vaccine.,So, you know, the thing is to remember that,because otherwise, 10 years from now,,we'll be back here trying to tell this story again. 
 So, what it says to me then is that it's not really --,the problem isn't really the stories that are being told,or which stories are being told,,the problem really is the terms of humanity,that we're willing to bring to complicate every story,,and that's really what it's all about.,Let me tell you a Nigerian joke.,Well, it's just a joke, anyway.,So there's Tom, Dick and Harry and they're working construction.,And Tom opens up his lunch box and there's rice in it,,and he goes on this rant about, "Twenty years,,my wife has been packing rice for lunch.,If she does it again tomorrow, I'm going to throw myself,off this building and kill myself.",And Dick and Harry repeat this.,The next day, Tom opens his lunchbox, there's rice,,so he throws himself off and kills himself,,and Tom, Dick and Harry follow.,And now the inquest -- you know, Tom's wife,and Dick's wife are distraught.,They wished they'd not packed rice.,But Harry's wife is confused, because she said, "You know,,Harry had been packing his own lunch for 20 years.",(Laughter) 
 This seemingly innocent joke, when I heard it as a child in Nigeria,,was told about Igbo, Yoruba and Hausa,,with the Hausa being Harry.,So what seems like an eccentric if tragic joke about Harry,becomes a way to spread ethnic hatred.,My father was educated in Cork, in the University of Cork, in the '50s.,In fact, every time I read in Ireland,,people get me all mistaken and they say,,"Oh, this is Chris O'Barney from Cork.",But he was also in Oxford in the '50s,,and yet growing up as a child in Nigeria,,my father used to say to me, "You must never eat or drink,in a Yoruba person's house because they will poison you.",It makes sense now when I think about it,,because if you'd known my father,,you would've wanted to poison him too.,(Laughter) 
 So I was born in 1966, at the beginning,of the Biafran-Nigerian Civil War, and the war ended after three years.,And I was growing up in school and the federal government,didn't want us taught about the history of the war,,because they thought it probably would make us,generate a new generation of rebels.,So I had a very inventive teacher, a Pakistani Muslim,,who wanted to teach us about this.,So what he did was to teach us Jewish Holocaust history,,and so huddled around books with photographs of people in Auschwitz,,I learned the melancholic history of my people,through the melancholic history of another people.,I mean, picture this -- really picture this.,A Pakistani Muslim teaching Jewish Holocaust history,to young Igbo children. 
 Story is powerful.,Story is fluid and it belongs to nobody.,And it should come as no surprise,that my first novel at 16 was about Neo-Nazis,taking over Nigeria to institute the Fourth Reich.,It makes perfect sense.,And they were to blow up strategic targets,and take over the country, and they were foiled,by a Nigerian James Bond called Coyote Williams,,and a Jewish Nazi hunter.,And it happened over four continents.,And when the book came out, I was heralded as Africa's answer,to Frederick Forsyth, which is a dubious honor at best.,But also, the book was launched in time for me to be accused,of constructing the blueprint for a foiled coup attempt.,So at 18, I was bonded off to prison in Nigeria. 
 I grew up very privileged, and it's important,to talk about privilege, because we don't talk about it here.,A lot of us are very privileged.,I grew up -- servants, cars, televisions, all that stuff.,My story of Nigeria growing up was very different from the story,I encountered in prison, and I had no language for it.,I was completely terrified, completely broken,,and kept trying to find a new language,,a new way to make sense of all of this.,Six months after that, with no explanation,,they let me go.,Now for those of you who have seen me at the buffet tables know,that it was because it was costing them too much to feed me.,(Laughter),But I mean, I grew up with this incredible privilege,,and not just me -- millions of Nigerians,grew up with books and libraries.,In fact, we were talking last night about how all,of the steamy novels of Harold Robbins,had done more for sex education of horny teenage boys in Africa,than any sex education programs ever had.,All of those are gone. 
 We are squandering the most valuable resource,we have on this continent: the valuable resource,of the imagination.,In the film, "Sometimes in April" by Raoul Peck,,Idris Elba is poised in a scene with his machete raised,,and he's being forced by a crowd to chop up his best friend --,fellow Rwandan Army officer, albeit a Tutsi --,played by Fraser James.,And Fraser's on his knees, arms tied behind his back,,and he's crying.,He's sniveling.,It's a pitiful sight.,And as we watch it, we are ashamed.,And we want to say to Idris, "Chop him up.,Shut him up.",And as Idris moves, Fraser screams, "Stop!,Please stop!",Idris pauses, then he moves again,,and Fraser says, "Please!,Please stop!",And it's not the look of horror and terror on Fraser's face that stops Idris or us;,it's the look in Fraser's eyes.,It's one that says, "Don't do this.,And I'm not saying this to save myself,,although this would be nice. I'm doing it to save you,,because if you do this, you will be lost.",To be so afraid that you're standing in the face,of a death you can't escape and that you're soiling yourself,and crying, but to say in that moment,,as Fraser says to Idris, "Tell my girlfriend I love her.",In that moment, Fraser says,,"I am lost already, but not you ... not you.",This is a redemption we can all aspire to. 
 African narratives in the West, they proliferate.,I really don't care anymore.,I'm more interested in the stories we tell about ourselves --,how as a writer, I find that African writers,have always been the curators of our humanity on this continent.,The question is, how do I balance narratives that are wonderful,with narratives of wounds and self-loathing?,And this is the difficulty that I face.,I am trying to move beyond political rhetoric,to a place of ethical questioning.,I am asking us to balance the idea,of our complete vulnerability with the complete notion,of transformation of what is possible. 
 As a young middle-class Nigerian activist,,I launched myself along with a whole generation of us,into the campaign to stop the government.,And I asked millions of people,,without questioning my right to do so,,to go up against the government.,And I watched them being locked up in prison and tear gassed.,I justified it, and I said, "This is the cost of revolution.,Have I not myself been imprisoned?,Have I not myself been beaten?",It wasn't until later, when I was imprisoned again,,that I understood the real meaning of torture,,and how easy your humanity can be taken from you,,for the time I was engaged in war,,righteous, righteous war.,Excuse me. 
 Sometimes I can stand before the world --,and when I say this, transformation,is a difficult and slow process --,sometimes I can stand before the world and say,,"My name is Chris Abani.,I have been human six days, but only sometimes.",But this is a good thing.,It's never going to be easy.,There are no answers.,As I was telling Rachel from Google Earth,,that I had challenged my students in America --,I said, "You don't know anything about Africa, you're all idiots.",And so they said, "Tell me about Africa, Professor Abani.",So I went to Google Earth and learned about Africa.,And the truth be told, this is it, isn't it?,There are no essential Africans,,and most of us are as completely ignorant as everyone else,about the continent we come from,,and yet we want to make profound statements about it.,And I think if we can just admit that we're all trying,to approximate the truth of our own communities,,it will make for a much more nuanced,and a much more interesting conversation.,I want to believe that we can be agnostic about this,,that we can rise above all of this. 
 When I was 10, I read James Baldwin's "Another Country,",and that book broke me.,Not because I was encountering homosexual sex and love,for the first time, but because the way James wrote about it,made it impossible for me to attach otherness to it.,"Here," Jimmy said.,"Here is love, all of it.",The fact that it happens in "Another Country",takes you quite by surprise.,My friend Ronald Gottesman says there are three kinds of people in the world:,those who can count, and those who can't.,(Laughter),He also says that the cause of all our trouble,is the belief in an essential, pure identity:,religious, ethnic, historical, ideological. 
 I want to leave you with a poem by Yusef Komunyakaa,that speaks to transformation.,It's called "Ode to the Drum," and I'll try and read it,the way Yusef would be proud to hear it read.,"Gazelle, I killed you for your skin's exquisite touch,,for how easy it is to be nailed to a board,weathered raw as white butcher paper.,Last night I heard my daughter praying for the meat here at my feet.,You know it wasn't anger that made me stop my heart till the hammer fell.,Weeks ago, you broke me as a woman,once shattered me into a song beneath her weight,,before you slouched into that grassy hush.,And now I'm tightening lashes, shaped in hide as if around a ribcage,,shaped like five bowstrings.,Ghosts cannot slip back inside the body's drum.,You've been seasoned by wind, dusk and sunlight.,Pressure can make everything whole again.,Brass nails tacked into the ebony wood,,your face has been carved five times.,I have to drive trouble in the hills.,Trouble in the valley,,and trouble by the river too.,There is no palm wine, fish, salt, or calabash.,Kadoom. Kadoom. Kadoom.,Ka-doooom.,Now I have beaten a song back into you.,Rise and walk away like a panther.",Thank you.,(Applause)I don't speak English.,I start speaking English, learning English, about a year ago.,I speak French and I grew up with French, so my English is Franglais.,I'm born in the Western Congo, in an area around here,,and then went to university in Kisangani.,And after I finished, I went to this area, the Ituri Forest.,But what I've been doing --,when I was about 14, I grew in my uncle's house.,And my father was a soldier,,and my uncle was a fisherman and also a poacher.,What I've been doing from 14 to 17 was,,I was assisting them collecting ivory tusk, meat,and whatever they were killing, poaching, hunting in the forest,,bring it in the main city to get access to the market. 
 But finally, I got myself involved.,Around 17 to 20 years, I became, myself, a poacher.,And I wanted to do it, because -- I believed -- to continue my studies.,I wanted to go to university, but my father was poor, my uncle even.,So, I did it.,And for three to four years, I went to university.,For three times, I applied to biomedical science, to be a doctor.,I didn't succeed.,I was having my inscriptions, my admission to biology.,And I said, "No way, I'm not doing it.,My family's poor, my area don't have better health care.,I want to be a doctor to serve them.",Three times, that means three years, and I start getting old.,I say, "Oh, no, I continue.",So, I did tropical ecology and plant botany.,When I finished, I went to the Ituri Forest for my internship.,It's where I really getting passion with what I'm doing,right up to now -- I'm standing in front of you --,doing botany and wildlife conservation. 
 That time the Ituri Forest was created as a forest reserve,with some animals and also plants.,And the training center there was built,around the scientific Congolese staff,and some American scientists also.,So, the Okapi Faunal Reserve protects number --,I think that is the largest number of elephants,we have right now in protected areas in Congo.,It has also chimpanzees.,And it has been named Okapi Faunal Reserve,because of this beautiful creature.,That is a forest giraffe.,I think you guys know it quite well.,Here we have savanna giraffes,,but through evolution we have this forest giraffe,that lives only in Congo.,It has also some beautiful primates.,Thirteen species -- highest diversity we can find in one single area in Africa.,And it has the Ituri Forest itself --,about 1,300 species of plants, so far known. 
 I joined the Wildlife Conservation Society, working there, in 1995,,but I started working with them as a student in 1991.,I was appointed as a teaching assistant at my university,because I accomplished with honor.,But I didn't like the way -- the instruction I got was very poor.,And I wanted to be formed to a training center and a research center.,With the end of the dictatorship regime of Mobutu Sese Seko,,that most of you know, life became very, very difficult.,And the work we have been doing,was completely difficult to do and to achieve it. 
 When Kabila started his movement to liberate Congo,,so Mobutu soldiers started moving and retreated.,So they started fleeing from the east to the west.,And the Okapi Faunal Reserve is there,,so there was a road from Goma, somewhere here,,and coming like this.,So they might go through, pass through the Okapi Faunal Reserve.,Congo has five of the world's richest sites of protected area,,and the Okapi Faunal Reserve is one of them.,So soldier was fleeing in the Okapi Faunal Reserve.,On their way, they looted everything.,Torture, wars -- oh, my God, you can't believe.,Every person was looking his way -- where to go, we don't know.,And it was for us, the young, the first time really,we hear the language of war, of guns.,And even people who faced the rebellion of 1963,,after our independence, they didn't believe what was happening.,They were killing people. They were doing whatever they want,because they have power.,Who have been doing that?,Young children. Child soldiers.,You can't ask him how old he is because he has guns. 
 But I was from the west, working in the east.,I even [at] that time was not speaking Swahili.,And when they came, they looted everything.,You can't speak Lingala because Lingala was from Mobutu,,and everyone speaking Lingala is soldier.,And I was from the same area to him.,All my friends said, we are leaving because we are a target.,But I'm not going to the east, because I don't know Swahili.,I stay. If I go, I will be killed.,I can't go back to my area -- it's more than 1,000 kilometers [away]. 
 I stayed after they looted everything.,We have been doing research on botany,,and we have a small herbarium of 4,500 sheets of plants.,We cut, we dry and we packed them,,we mounted them on a folder.,Purpose: so that we start them for agriculture,,for medicine, for whatever, and for science,,for the study of the flora and the change of the forest.,That is people moving around, that's even Pygmies.,And this is a bright guy, hard-working person, and Pygmy.,I've been working with him about 10 years.,And with soldiers, they went to the forest for poaching elephants.,Because he's Pygmy, he knows how to track elephants in the forest.,He has been attacked by a leopard and they abandon him in the forest.,They came to told me, I have to save him.,And what I did, I gave him just antibiotics,that we care for tuberculosis.,And fortunately, I saved his life. 
 And that was the language of the war.,Everywhere there has been constant extraction of mineral,,killing animals, the logging timbers and so on.,And what of important things --,I think all of you here have a cell phone.,That mineral has killed a lot:,five millions of Congolese have gone because of this,Colombo-Tantalite -- they call it Coltan --,that they use it to make cell phones,and it has been in that area, all over in Congo. Extraction,,and good, big business of the war. 
 And what I did for the first war, after we have lost everything,,I have to save something, even myself, my life and life of the staff.,I buried some of our new vehicle engines, I buried it to save it.,And some of equipment went with them,,on the top of the canopy, to save it.,He's not collecting plants, he's going to save our equipment,on the canopy.,And with the material that's left --,because they wanted to destroy it, to burn it,,they didn't understand it, they didn't go to school --,I packed it.,And that is me, going to, hurrying to Uganda,,to try to save that 4,000 material,,with people carrying them on the bikes, bicycles.,And after that, we succeeded.,I housed that 4,000 material at the herbarium of Makerere University.,And after the war, I have been able to bring it back home,,so that we continue our studies. 
 The second war came while we didn't expect it.,With friends, we had been sitting and watching match football,,and having some good music with WorldSpace radio,,when it started, I think.,So, it was so bad.,We heard that now from the east again the war started,,and it's going fast.,This time I think Kabila will go in place of, as he did with Mobutu.,And the reserve was a target to the rebels.,Three different movements and two militia acting in the same area,and competing for natural resources.,And there was no way to work.,They destroy everything.,Poaching -- oh, no way.,And that's the powerful men. We have to meet and to talk to them.,What's the regulation of the reserve,and what is the regulation of the parks?,And they can't do what they are doing.,So we went to meet them.,That is Coltan extraction, gold mining. 
 So, we started talking with them,,convincing them that we are in a protected area.,There are regulations,that it's prohibited to do logging, mining and poaching, specifically.,But they said, "You guys,,you think that soldiers who are dying are not important,,and your animals you are protecting are most important.,We don't think so.,We have to do it, because to let our movement advance.",I say, "No way, you are not going to do it here.",We started talking with them and I was negotiating.,Tried to protect our equipment, tried to protect our staff,and the villages of about 1,500 people.,And we continued. 
 But I was doing that, negotiating with them.,Sometimes we are having meeting,and they are talking with Jean-Pierre Bemba,,with Mbusa Nyamwisi, with Kabila, and I'm there.,Sometimes, they talk to my own language, that is, Lingala.,I hear it and what strategy they are doing, what they are planning.,Sometimes, they are having a helicopter,to supply them with ammunition and so on.,They used me to carry that, and I was doing counting,,what comes from where, and where, and where.,I had only this equipment -- my satellite phone, my computer,and a plastic solar panel -- that I hide it in the forest.,And every time, daily, after we have meeting,,what compromise we have, whatever,,I go, I write a short email, send it.,I don't know how many people I had on my address.,I sent the message: what is going about the progress of the war,and what they are planning to do.,They started suspecting that what we do on the morning,,and the afternoon, it's on the news, BBC, RFI.,(Laughter),Something might be going on.,And one day, we went for a meeting.,(Applause),Sorry. 
 One day, we went to meet the Chief Commander.,He had the same iridium cell phone like me.,And he asked me, "Do you know how to use this?",I said, "I have never seen it.,(Laughter),I don't know.",And I had mine on my pocket.,So, it was a chance that they trusted me a lot.,They didn't -- they was not looking on me.,So I was scared.,And when we finished the meeting, I went to return it in the forest.,And I was sending news, doing whatever,,reporting daily to the U.N., to UNESCO, to our institution in New York,,what have been going.,And for that, they have been having big pressure to leave, to free the area.,Because there was no way --,whatever they do, it's known the same time. 
 During the first two rebellions, they killed all animals in the zoo.,We have a zoo of 14 Okapis, and one of them was pregnant.,And during the war, after a week of heavy war, fighting in the area,,we succeeded: we had the first Okapi.,This is the only trouser and shirt remind me of this.,This is not local population, this is rebels.,They are now happy sending the news,that they have protected the Okapi with the war,,because we sent the news that they are killing,and poaching everywhere.,After a week, we celebrated the birthday of that Okapi,,they killed an elephant, just 50 meters to the area,where the zoo, where Okapi was born.,And I was mad.,I oppose it -- that they are now going to dissect it,,until I do my report and then I see the Chief Commander.,And I succeeded.,The elephant just decayed and they just got the tusks. 
 What we are doing after that -- that was the situation of the war --,we have to rebuild.,I had some money. I was paid 150 dollars.,I devoted half of it to rebuild the herbarium,,because we didn't have good infrastructure to start plants.,Wildlife Conservation Society more dealing with plants.,I started this with 70 dollars,,and start fundraising money to where I've been going.,I had opportunity to go all over,,where herbarium for my African material is.,And they supported me a bit, and I built this.,Now, it's doing work to train young Congolese. 
 And also, what one of the speciality we are doing,,my design is tracking the global warming effect on biodiversity,,and what the impacts of the Ituri Forest is playing to uptake carbon.,This is one of the studies we are doing on a 40-hectare plot,,where we have tagged trees and lianas from one centimeters,,and we are tracking them.,We have now data of about 15 years,,to see how that forest is contributing to the carbon reductions.,And that is -- I think it's difficult for me.,This is a very embarrassing talk, I know.,I don't know where to start, where to finish it. 
 When I was thinking to come here,,what best title I wanted to say to my talk, I didn't find this.,But now I think that I would have titled it, "The Language of Guns.",Where are you people?,Now we are talking about reconstitution, rebuild Africa.,But is gun industries a tool to rebuild, or is it a game?,I think we see the war like a game --,like soccer, football.,Everybody is happy, but see what it's doing,,see what is going in Darfur.,Now we say, oh, my God.,See what the wars in Rwanda.,That's because of the language of guns.,I don't think that someone may blame Google,,because it's doing the right things,,even if people like Al-Qaeda are using Google,to connect between them.,But it's serving millions for the best.,But what is doing with gun industries?,Thank you.,(Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: Thank you, thank you.,Just wait over there.,It's an amazing story.,I suspect a lot of people here have the same question I have.,How can we help you? 
 Corneille Ewango: That's really embarrassing questions.,I think that now I feel nervous.,And I think, helping us, people are acting sometimes by ignorance.,I did it myself.,If I know when I was young,,that [by] killing an elephant, I'm destroying biodiversity,,I would not have done it.,Many, many of you have seen the talents of Africans,,but there are few who are going to school.,Many are dying because of all those kind of pandemics,,HIV, malaria, poverty, not going to school.,What you can assist us, it's by building capacities.,How many have got opportunity like me,to go to U.S., do a master's?,And go -- now, I'm in the Netherlands to do a Ph.D.,But many of them are just here, because they don't have money.,And they can't go even to university.,They can't even attain the bachelor's degree.,Building capacities for the young generation,is going to make a better generation,and a better future tomorrow for Africa. 
 CA: Thank you, thank you.,(Applause)Just to put everything in context,,and to kind of give you a background to where I'm coming from,,so that a lot of the things I'm going to say,,and the things I'm going to do --,or things I'm going to tell you I've done --,you will understand exactly why and how I got motivated to be where I am.,I graduated high school in Cleveland, Ohio, 1975.,And just like my parents did when they finished studying abroad, we went back home.,Finished university education, got a medical degree, 1986.,And by the time I was an intern house officer,,I could barely afford to maintain my mother's 13-year-old car --,and I was a paid doctor.,This brings us to why a lot of us, who are professionals,,are now, as they say, in diaspora.,Now, are we going to make that a permanent thing,,where we all get trained, and we leave, and we don't go back?,Perhaps not, I should certainly hope not --,because that is not my vision. 
 All right, for good measure, that's where Nigeria is on the African map,,and just there is the Delta region that I'm sure everybody's heard of.,People getting kidnapped, where the oil comes from,,the oil that sometimes I think has driven us all crazy in Nigeria.,But, critical poverty: this slide is from a presentation I gave,not that long ago. Gapminder.org tells the story of the gap,between Africa and the rest of the world in terms of health care.,Very interesting. 
 How many people do you think are on that taxi?,And believe it or not, that is a taxi in Nigeria.,And the capital -- well, what used to be the capital of Nigeria -- Lagos,,that's a taxi, and you have police on them.,So, tell me, how many policemen do you think are on this taxi? And now? Three.,So, when these kind of people -- and, believe me, it's not just the police,that use these taxis in Lagos. We all do. I've been on one of these,,and I didn't have a helmet, either.,And it just reminds me of the thought of what happens when one of us,on a taxi like this falls off, has an accident and needs a hospital. 
 Believe it or not, some of us do survive.,Some of us do survive malaria; we do survive AIDS.,And like I tell my family, and my wife reminds me every time,,"You're risking your life, you know, every time you go to that country.",And she's right. Every time you go there,,you know that if you actually need critical care --,critical care of any sort -- if you have an accident --,of which there are many, there are accidents everywhere --,where do they go?,Where do they go when they need help for this kind of stuff?,I'm not saying instead of, I'm saying as well as,,AIDS, TB, malaria, typhoid -- the list goes on.,I'm saying, where do they go when they're like me?,When I go back home -- and I do all kinds of things,,I teach, I train -- but I catch one of these things,,or I'm chronically ill with one of those, where do they go?,What's the economic impact when one of them dies or becomes disabled? 
 I think it's quite significant. This is where they go.,These are not old pictures and these are not from some downtrodden --,this is a major hospital. In fact, it's from a major teaching hospital in Nigeria.,Now that is less than a year old, in an operating room.,That's sterilizing equipment in Nigeria.,You remember all that oil?,Yes, I'm sorry if it upsets some of you, but,I think you need to see this. That's the floor, OK?,You can say some of this is education.,You can say it's hygiene. I'm not pleading poverty.,I'm saying we need more than just, you know, vaccination,,malaria, AIDS, because I want to be treated,in a proper hospital if something happens to me out there.,In fact, when I start running around saying,,"Hey, boys and girls, you're cardiologists in the U.S.,,can you come home with me and do a mission?",I want them to think, "Well there's some hope." 
 Now, have a look at that. That's the anesthesiology machine.,And that's my specialty, right?,Anesthesiology and critical care -- look at that bag.,It's been taped with tape that we even stopped using in the U.K.,And believe me, these are current pictures.,Now, if something like this, which has happened in the U.K.,,that's where they go. This is the intensive care unit in which I work. 
 All right, this is a slide from a talk I gave,about intensive care units in Nigeria,,and jokingly we refer to it as "Expensive Scare.",Because it's scary and it's expensive, but we need to have it, OK?,So, these are the problems.,There are no prizes for telling us what the problems are, are there?,I think we all know. And several speakers before,and speakers after me are going to tell us even more problems.,These are a few of them. So, what did I do? 
 There we go -- we're going on a mission.,We're going to do some open-heart surgery. I was the only Brit,,on a team of about nine American cardiac surgeons,,cardiac nurse, intensive care nurse.,We all went out and did a mission and we've done three of them so far.,Just so you know, I do believe in missions, I do believe in aid,and I do believe in charity. They have their place,,but where do they go for those things we talked about earlier?,Because it's not everyone that's going to benefit from a mission.,Health is wealth, in the words of Hans Rosling.,You get wealthier faster if you are healthy first. 
 So, here we are, mission. Big trouble.,Open-heart surgery in Nigeria -- big trouble.,That's Mike, Mike comes out from Mississippi.,Does he look like he's happy?,It took us two days just to organize the place, but hey,,you know, we worked on it. Does he look happy?,Yes, that's the medical advice the committee chairman says,,"Yes, I told you, you weren't going to be able to,,you can't do this, I just know it.",Look, that's the technician we had. So yes, you go on, all right? 
 (Laughter) 
 I got him to come with me -- anesthesia tech -- come with me from the U.K.,Yes, let's just go work this thing out.,See, that's one of the problems we have in Nigeria and in Africa generally.,We get a lot of donated equipment.,Equipment that's obsolete, equipment that doesn't quite work,,or it works and you can't fix it. And there's nothing wrong with that,,so long as we use it and we move on. 
 But we had problems with it. We had severe problems there.,He had to get on the phone. This guy was always on the phone.,So what we going to do now?,It looks like all these Americans are here and,yes, one Brit, and he's not going to do anything --,he thinks he's British actually, and he's actually Nigerian,,I just thought about that.,We eventually got it working, is the truth,,but it was one of these. Even older than the one you saw. 
 The reason I have this picture here, this X-ray,,it's just to tell you where and how we were viewing X-rays.,Do you figure where that is? It was on a window.,I mean, what's an X-ray viewing box? Please.,Well, nowadays everything's on PAX anyway.,You look at your X-rays on a screen and you do stuff with them,,you email them. But we were still using X-rays,,but we didn't even have a viewing box!,And we were doing open-heart surgery. 
 OK, I know it's not AIDS, I know it's not malaria,,but we still need this stuff. Oh yeah, echo --,this was just to get the children ready and the adults ready.,People still believe in Voodoo. Heart disease,,VSD, hole in the heart, tetralogies.,You still get people who believe in it and they came.,At 67 percent oxygen saturation, the normal is about 97.,Her condition, open-heart surgery that as she required,,would have been treated when she was a child.,We had to do these for adults. So, we did succeed and we still do.,We've done three. We're planning another one in July,in the north of the country. So, we certainly still do open-heart,,but you can see the contrast between everything that was shipped in --,we ship everything, instruments. We had explosions,because the kit was designed and installed by people who weren't used to it.,The oxygen tanks didn't quite work right. 
 But how many did we do the first one? 12.,We did 12 open-heart surgical patients successfully.,Here is our very first patient, out of intensive care,,and just watch that chair, all right?,This is what I mean about appropriate technology.,That's what he was doing, propping up the bed because the bed simply didn't work.,Have you seen one of those before?,No? Yes? Doesn't matter, it worked.,I'm sure you've all seen or heard this before:,"We, the willing, have been doing so much with so little for so long -- 
 (Applause),-- we are now qualified to do anything with nothing." 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. Sustainable Solutions -- this was my first company.,This one's sole aim is to provide the very things that I think are missing.,So, we put my hand in my pocket and say, "Guys, let's just buy stuff.,Let's go set up a company that teaches people, educates them,,gives them the tools they need to keep going." 
 And that's a perfect example of one.,Usually when you buy a ventilator in a hospital,,you buy a different one for children,,you buy a different one for transport. This one will do everything,,and it will do it at half the price and doesn't need compressed air.,If you're in America and you don't know about this one, we do,,because we make it our duty to find out,what's appropriate technology for Africa -- what's appropriately priced,,does the job, and we move on. Anesthesia machine:,multi-parameter monitor, operating lights, suction.,This little unit here -- remember your little 12-volt plug in the car,,that charges your, whatever, Game Boy, telephone?,That's exactly how the outlets are designed.,Yes, it will take a solar panel. Yes a solar panel will charge it.,But if you've got mains as well, it will charge the batteries in there.,And guess what? We have a little pedal charger too, just in case.,And guess what, if it all fails,,if you can find a car that's still got a live battery,and you stick it in, it will still work. Then you can customize it.,Is it dental surgery you want? General surgery you want?,Decide which instruments, stock it up with consumables. 
 And currently we're working on oxygen -- oxygen delivery on-site.,The technology for oxygen delivery is not new.,Oxygen concentrators are very old technology. What is new,,and what we will have in a few months, I hope,,is that ability to use this same renewable energy system,to provide and produce oxygen on site. Zeolite -- it's not new --,zeolite removes nitrogen from air and nitrogen is 78 percent of air.,If you take nitrogen out, what's left? Oxygen, pretty much.,So that's not new. What we're doing is applying this technology to it. 
 These are the basic features of my device, or our device.,This is what makes it so special.,Apart from the awards it's won,,it's portable and it's certified. It's registered, the MHRA --,and the CE mark, for those who don't know, for Europe, is the equivalent,of the FDA in the U.S.,If you compare it with what's on the market, price-wise,,size-wise, ease of use, complexity ... 
 This picture was taken last year.,These are members of my graduating class, 1986.,It was in this gentleman's house in the Potomac,,for those of you who are familiar with Maryland.,There are too many of us outside and everybody,,just to borrow a bit from Hans -- Hans Rosling, he's my guy --,if the size of the text represents what gets the most attention,,it's the problems. But what we really need are African solutions,that are appropriate for Africa -- looking at the culture,,looking at the people, looking at how much money they've got.,African people, because they will do it with a passion, I hope.,And lots and lots of that little bit down there, sacrifice.,You have to do it. Africans have to do it,,in conjunction with everyone else. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)You know, there's a small country nestled in the Himalayan Mountains,,far from these beautiful mountains, where the people,of the Kingdom of Bhutan have decided to do something different,,which is to measure their gross national happiness,rather than their gross national product.,And why not?,After all, happiness is not just a privilege for the lucky few,,but a fundamental human right for all.,And what is happiness?,Happiness is the freedom of choice.,The freedom to chose where to live,,what to do, what to buy, what to sell,,from whom, to whom, when and how.,Where does choice come from?,And who gets to express it, and how do we express it? 
 Well, one way to express choice is through the market.,Well-functioning markets provide choices, and ultimately,,the ability to express one's pursuit for happiness.,The great Indian economist, Amartya Sen, was awarded the Nobel prize,for demonstrating that famine is not so much about,the availability of food supply, but rather the ability to acquire,or entitle oneself to that food through the market.,In 1984, in what can only be considered one of the,greatest crimes of humanity, nearly one million people died of starvation,in my country of birth, Ethiopia.,Not because there was not enough food --,because there was actually a surplus of food,in the fertile regions of the south parts of the country --,but because in the north, people could not access,or entitle themselves to that food.,That was a turning point for my life. 
 Most Africans today, by far, are farmers.,And most of Africa's farmers are, by and large,,small farmers in terms of land that they operate, and very, very small,farmers in terms of the capital they have at their disposal.,African agriculture today is among, or is, the most under-capitalized in the world.,Only seven percent of arable land in Africa is irrigated,,compared to 40 percent in Asia.,African farmers only use some 22 kilograms of fertilizer per hectare,,compared to 144 in Asia.,Road density is six times greater in Asia than it is in rural Africa.,There are eight times more tractors in Latin America,,and three times more tractors in Asia, than in Africa.,The small farmer in Africa today lives a life without much choice,,and therefore without much freedom.,His livelihood is predetermined,by the conditions of grinding poverty.,He comes to the market when prices are lowest,,with the meager fruits of his hard labor, just after the harvest,,because he has no choice.,She comes back to the market,some months later, when prices are highest, in what we call,the lean season -- when food is scarce --,because she has to feed her family and has no choice. 
 The real question is, how can markets be developed in rural Africa,to harness the power of innovation and entrepreneurship,that we know exists?,Another notable economist, Theodore Schultz,,in 1974 won the Nobel prize for demonstrating that farmers,are efficient, but poor.,Meaning, in fact, that farmers are rational,and profit-minded just like everybody else.,Well, we don't need, now,,any more Nobel prizes to know that farmers want a fair shake,at the market and want to make money, just like everyone else.,And one thing is clear, which is at least now we know,that Africa is open for business.,And that business is agriculture.,Over two decades ago, the world insisted to Africa that markets,must be liberalized, that economies must be structurally adjusted.,This meant that governments were to remove themselves,from the business of buying and selling --,which they did rather inefficiently --,and let the private market do its magic.,Well, what happened over the last 25 years?,Did Africa feed itself?,Did our farmers turn into highly productive commercial actors? 
 I think we're all in this room,,probably, because we know that, in fact, Africa is the only region,in the world where hunger and malnutrition are projected to go up,over the next 10 years,,where the food import bill is now double,what it was 20 years ago,,where food production per capita has,stagnated, and where fertilizer use has declined rather than increased.,So why didn't agriculture markets perform to expectations?,The market reforms prompted by the West --,and I've spent some 15 years traveling around the continent,doing research on agricultural markets, and have interviewed,traders in 10 to 15 countries in this continent, hundreds of traders --,trying to understand what went wrong with our market reform.,And it seems to me that the reforms might have,thrown the baby out with the bath water. 
 Like its agriculture,,Africa's markets are highly under-capitalized and inefficient.,We know from our work around the continent,that transaction costs of reaching the market,,and the risks of transacting in rural, agriculture markets,,are extremely high.,In fact, only one third of agricultural output,produced in Africa even reaches the market.,Africa's markets are weak not only because of weak infrastructure,in terms of roads and telecommunications, but also because,of the virtual absence of necessary market institutions, such as,market information, grades and standards,,and reliable ways to connect buyers and sellers.,Because of this, commodity buyers and sellers typically transact in small circles,,in narrow networks of people they know and trust.,And because of that, as grain changes hands --,and I've measured that it changes hands four, five times in,its trajectory from the farmer to the consumer --,every time it changes hands -- and I've seen this all over rural Africa --,it also changes sacks. 
 And I thought that was incredibly peculiar.,And really realized that that was because -- as traders would tell me,over and over -- that's the only way people know what they're getting,in terms of the quantity and the product quality.,And that actually has huge implications,for the ability of markets to quickly respond to price signals,,and situations where there are deficits, for example.,It also has very high cost implications.,I have measured that 26 percent of the marketing margin,is simply due to the fact that, because of the absence,of grades and standards and market information,,sacks have to be constantly changed.,And this leads to very high handling costs.,For their part, small farmers, who produce the bulk of our agricultural output in Africa,,come to the market with virtually no information at all -- blind --,trusting that they're going to have,some sort of demand for their produce,,and completely at the mercy of the merchants,in the only market, the nearest local market they know --,where they're unable to negotiate better prices or reduce their risk. 
 Speaking of risk, we have seen that price volatility,of food crops in Africa is the highest in the world.,In Africa, small farmers bear the brunt of this risk.,In fact, in my view, there is no region of the world and no period in history,that farmers have been expected to bear the kind of market risk,that Africa's farmers have to bear.,And in my view, there is simply no place in the world,that has grown its agriculture on the kind of risk,that our farmers in Africa today face.,In Ethiopia, for example, the variation in maize prices,from year to year is as much as 50 percent annually.,This kind of market risk is mind-boggling, and has direct implications,for not only the incentives of farmers to invest,in higher productivity technology, such as modern seeds and fertilizers,,but also direct implications for food security. 
 To give you an example, between 2001 and 2002,,Ethiopian maize farmers produced two years of bumper harvest.,That in turn, because of the weak marketing system,,led to an 80 percent collapse in maize prices in the country.,This made it unprofitable for some farmers to even harvest the grain from the fields.,And we calculated that some 300,000 tons of grain,was left in the fields to rot in early 2002.,Not six months later, in July 2002, Ethiopia announced a major food crisis,,to the same proportions as 1984: 14 million people at risk of starvation.,What also happened that year,is in the areas where there were good rains, and where farmers,had previously produced surplus grain, farmers had decided,to withdraw from the fertilizer market, not use fertilizer,and actually had dropped their use of fertilizer by 27 percent.,This is a tragic example of arrested development,,or a budding green revolution stopped in its tracks.,And this is not just specific to Ethiopia,,but happens over and over, all over Africa. 
 Well, I'm not here today to lament about the situation, or wring my hands.,I am here to tell you that change is in the air.,Africa today is not the Africa waiting for aid solutions,,or cookie-cutter foreign expert policy prescriptions.,Africa has learned, or is learning somewhat slowly,,that markets don't happen by themselves.,In the 1980s, it was very fashionable,to talk about getting prices right.,There was a very influential book about that,,which was mainly about getting governments out of the market.,We now recognize that getting markets right is about not just,price incentives, but also investing in the right infrastructure,and the appropriate and necessary institutions to create,the conditions to unleash the power of innovation in the market.,When conditions are right, we know and see,that that innovation is ready to explode in rural Africa,,just like anywhere else. 
 Nearly three years ago, I decided to leave my comfortable job,as a World Bank senior economist in Washington,and come back to my country of birth, Ethiopia,,after nearly 30 years abroad.,I did so for a simple reason.,After having spent more than a decade,understanding, studying, and trying to convince policymakers and donors,about what was wrong with Africa's agricultural markets,,I decided it was time to do something about it.,I currently lead, in Ethiopia, an exciting new initiative,to establish the first Ethiopia Commodity Exchange, or ECX.,Now, the commodity exchange itself, that concept,,is not new to the world.,In fact, in 1848, 82 grain merchants and farmers got together,in a small town at the crossroads of the Illinois River and Lake Michigan,to establish a way to trade better amongst themselves. 
 That was, of course, the birth of the Chicago Board of Trade,,which is the most famous commodity exchange in the world.,The Chicago Board of Trade was established then,for precisely the same reasons,that our farmers today would benefit from a commodity exchange.,In the American Midwest, farmers used to load grain onto barges,and send it upriver to the Chicago market.,But once it arrived, if no buyer was to be found,,or if prices suddenly dropped, farmers would incur tremendous losses.,And in fact, would even dump the grain in Lake Michigan,,rather than spend more money transporting it back to their farms.,Well, the need to avoid these huge risks and tremendous losses,led to the birth of the futures market, and the underlying system,of grading grain and receipting -- issuing warehouse receipts,on the basis of which trade could be done. 
 From there, the greatest innovation of all came about in this market,,which is that buyers and sellers could transact grain,without actually having to physically or visually inspect the grain.,That meant that grain could be traded across tremendous distances,,and even across time -- as far forward as 18 months into the future.,This innovation is at the heart of the transformation of American agriculture,,and the rise of Chicago to a global market,,agricultural market, superpower from where it was, a small regional town.,Now, over the last century,,we tend to think of commodity exchanges as the purview,of Western industrialized countries,,and that the reference prices for cotton, coffee, cocoa --,products produced mainly in the south --,are actually a reference price, or a price discovered in these,organized commodity exchanges in the northern countries.,But that is actually changing. 
 And we're seeing a shift --,powered mainly because of information technology --,a shift in market dominance towards the emerging markets.,And over the last decade, you see that the share of Western exchanges --,and this is the U.S. share of exchanges in the world --,has gone down by nearly half in just the last decade.,Similarly, there's been explosive growth in India, for example,,where rural farmers are using exchanges -- growing here,over the last three years by 270 percent a year.,This is powered by low-cost VSAT technology,,aggressively trying to reach farmers to bring them into the market.,China's Dalian Commodity Exchange, three years ago,,2004, overtook the Chicago Board of Trade to become,the second largest commodity exchange in the world.,Now, in Ethiopia, we're in the process of designing,the first organized Ethiopia Commodity Exchange.,We're not trying to cut and paste the Chicago model,or the India model, but creating a system uniquely tailored,to Ethiopia's needs and realities,,Ethiopia's small farmers. 
 So, the ECX is an Ethiopian exchange for Ethiopia.,We're creating a system that serves all market actors,,that creates integrity, trust, efficiency, transparency,and enables small farmers to manage the risks that I have described.,In the design of our commodity exchange in Ethiopia,,we've done something rather unique, which is to,take the approach of an integrated perspective,,or what we call the ECX Edge.,The ECX Edge pretty much creates the entire ecosystem,in which the market will develop itself.,And this is because one of the things we've learned,over the last decade of studying market development in Africa,is that the piecemeal approach does not work.,You've got one donor trying to develop market information,,another trying to work on or sponsor grades and standards,,another ICT, and yet another on warehousing, or warehouse receipts. 
 In our approach in Ethiopia,,we've decided to put together the entire ecosystem,,or environment, in which trade takes place.,That means that the exchange will operate a trading system,,which will initially start as an open outcry,,because we don't think the country's ready for full electronic trading.,But at the same time, we'll do something which I think no exchange,in the world has ever done, which is itself to operate something like,an Internet cafe in the rural areas.,So that farmers and small traders,can actually come to a terminal center -- what we call,the remote access terminal centers -- and actually,,without having to buy a computer or figure out how to dial up,or any of those things, simply see the trading,that's happening on the Addis Ababa trading floor. 
 At the same time, what's very fundamental to this market is that --,and again, an innovation that we've designed for our exchange --,is that the exchange will operate warehouses around the country,,in which grade certification and warehouse receipting will be done.,And in turn, we'll operate an in-house clearing system,,to assure that payment is done appropriately,,in the right amount and at the right time,,so that basically, we create trust and integrity in the system.,Obviously, we work with exchange actors,,and as we're developing the exchange market itself,,we're also developing the regulatory infrastructure and legal framework,,the overarching legal framework for making this market work. 
 So, in fact, our proclamation,is going to parliament next month.,What's really important is that the ECX will operate a market information system,to disseminate prices in real time to farmers around the country,,using VSAT technology to bring an electronic price dissemination,directly to farmers.,What this does is transforms, fundamentally,,the farmers' relationship to the market.,Whereas before the farmer used to think local --,meaning that he or she would go to the nearest local market,,eight to 10 kilometers away on average,,and sell whatever they happened to have,,without any idea of what the price premium or anything else was --,now farmers come with knowledge of what prices are at the national market.,And they start to think national, and even global.,They start to make not only commercial marketing decisions,,but also planting decisions, on the basis of information,coming from the futures price market.,And they come to the market knowing what grades their products,will achieve in terms of a price premium. 
 So all of this will transform farmers.,It will also transform the way traders do business.,It will stop them from doing simple, back-to-back, limited arbitrage,to really thinking strategically about how to move grain,across long distances from [surplus regions] to [deficit areas].,Can Ethiopia do this?,It seems very ambitious.,But it will create new opportunities.,We believe that this initiative requires great political will,,and we'll have to align the financial sector, as well as the ICT sector,,and really even the underlying legal framework.,We believe that the winds of change are here, and that we can do it.,ECX is the market for Ethiopia's new millennium,,which starts in about eight months. 
 The last parliament of our century opened with our president,announcing to the country that this was the most important,economic initiative for the country today.,We believe that the stakes are high,,but that the returns will be even greater.,ECX, moreover, can become a trading platform for a pan-African market,in agricultural commodities.,Ethiopia's domestic market is about one billion dollars of value.,And we feel that over the next five years,,if Ethiopia can capture even 40 percent, just 40 percent, of the domestic market,,and add just 25 percent value to that market, the value of the market doubles.,Ethiopia's agricultural market is 30 percent higher,than South Africa's grain production,,and, in fact, Ethiopia is the second largest maize producer in Africa.,So the potential is there.,The will is there.,The commitment is there.,So we feel that we have a winning value proposition,to transform farmers' choices, to grow our agriculture,,and to change Africa.,So, we are in the business of finding our happiness.,Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)It is interesting that in the United States,,the most significant health-care budget,goes to cardiovascular disease care, whether it's private or public.,There's no comparison at all.,In Africa -- where it is a major killer -- it is totally ignored. 
 And that situation cannot be right. We must do something about it.,A health status of a nation parallels development of that nation.,17 million people die every year from heart disease.,32 million heart attacks and strokes occur.,Most of this is in developing countries, and the majority is in Africa.,85 percent of global disease burden for cardiovascular disease,is in developing countries -- not in the West --,and yet 90 percent of the resources are in the West. 
 Who is at risk? People like you.,It's not just the Africans that should be concerned about that.,All friends of Africa, that will have reason to be in Africa at some point in time,,should be very concerned about this deplorable situation.,Has anyone here wondered what will happen,if you go back to your room at night,,and you start getting chest pains, shortness of breath, sweating?,You're having a heart attack. What are you going to do?,Will you fly back to the U.S., Germany, Europe?,No, you will die. 50 percent will die within 24 hours, if not treated. 
 This is what's going on.,In a look at the map of the U.S. -- the graph here,,10 million people here, 10 million here.,By the time you get to 50, it's almost no one left in Nigeria --,life expectancy is 47.,It's not because some people don't survive childhood illnesses --,they do -- but they do not survive after the time that they reach,about 45 years old and 50 years old.,And those are the times they're most productive.,Those are the times that they should be contributing,to Africa's development. But they're not there.,The best way to spiral into a cycle of poverty is to kill the parents.,If you cannot secure the parents,,you cannot guarantee the security of the African child. 
 What are the risk factors?,It's very well known. I'm not going to spend a lot of time on those.,These are just for information:,hypertension, diabetes, obesity, lack of exercise. The usual suspects.,Right here in Tanzania, 30 percent of individuals have hypertension.,20 percent are getting treated.,Only less than one percent are adequately treated.,If we can treat hypertension alone in Africa,,we'll save 250,000 lives a year. That's quite significant! 
 Easy to treat. Look at the situation in Mauritius.,In eight short years -- we're here talking about HIV, malaria,,which is all good.,We cannot make the mistakes we've made with malaria and HIV.,In eight short years, non-communicable diseases,will become the leading causes of death in Africa. 
 That is something to keep in mind. We can't deal with it with situations like this.,This is a typical African hospital. We can't depend on the elites --,they go to USA, Germany, U.K. for treatment. Unbelievable.,You can't depend on foreign aid alone.,Here is the situation: countries are turning inwards.,Post-9/11, [the] United States has had a lot of trouble,to deal with, their own internal issues.,So, they spend their money trying to fix those problems.,You can't rightly -- it's not their responsibility,,it is my responsibility. I have to take care of my own problems.,If they help, that's good! But that is not my expectation.,These worsening indices of health care or health studies in Africa,demand a new look. We cannot keep on doing things,the way we've always done them.,If they have not worked, we have to look for alternative solutions. 
 I'm here to talk to you about solutions.,This has been -- what has been a difficult sign to some of us.,Several years ago, we started thinking about it.,Everyone knows the problem. No one knows what the solutions are.,We decided that we needed to put our money where our mouth is.,Everyone is ready to throw in money,,in terms of free money aid to developing countries.,Talk about sustainable investment, no one is interested.,You can't raise money.,I have done businesses in healthcare in the United States --,I live in Nashville, Tennessee, health care capital of America.,[It's] very easy to raise money for health-care ventures.,But start telling them, you know,,we're going to try to do it in Nigeria -- everyone runs away.,That is totally wrong. Those of you in the audience here,,if you want to help Africa, invest money in sustainable development. 
 Let me lead you through a day in the life of the Heart Institute,,so you get a glimpse of what we do,,and I'll talk a little bit more about it.,What we have done is to show that high-quality health care,,comparable to the best anywhere in the world,,can be done in a developing country environment.,We have 25 positions right now -- all of them trained,,board certified in the USA, Canada or Britain.,We have every modality that can be done in Vanderbilt,,Cleveland Clinic -- everywhere in the U.S. --,and we do it for about 10 percent of the cost,that you will need to do those things in the United States.,(Applause) 
 Additionally, we have a policy,that no one is ever turned away because of ability to pay.,We take care of everyone.,(Applause),Whether you have one dollar, two dollars -- it doesn't matter.,And I will tell you how we're able to do it. 
 We make sure that we select our equipment properly.,We go for modular units. Units that have multi-modality functions,have modular components. Easy to repair, and because of that,,we do not take things that are not durable and cannot last.,We emphasize training,,and we make sure that this process is regenerative.,Very soon we will all be dead and gone, but the problems will stay,,unless we have people taking over from where we stopped. 
 We made sure that we produced some things ourselves.,We do not buy unit doses of radiopharmaceuticals.,We get the generators from the companies.,We manufacture them in-house, ourselves. That keeps the costs down.,So, for a radiopharmaceutical in the U.S. --,that you'll get a unit dose for 250 dollars --,when we're finished manufacturing it in-house,,we come at a price of about two dollars.,(Applause) 
 We recognize that the only way to bridge the gap,between the rich and poor countries,is through education and technology.,All these problems we're talking about --,if we bring development, they will all disappear.,Technology is a great equalizer. How do we make it work?,It's been proved: self-care is cost-effective.,It extends opportunity to the rural centers,,and we can use expertise in a very smart way. 
 This is the way our centers are set up.,We currently have three locations in the Caribbean,,and we're planning a fourth one.,And we have now decided to go into Africa.,We will be doing the West African Heart Institute,in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. That project will be starting,within the next few months. We hope to open in 2008-09.,And we will do other centers.,This model can be adapted to every disease process.,All the units, all the centers, are linked,through a switched hub to a central server,,and all the images are populated to review stations.,And we designed this telemedicine solution. It's proprietary to us,,and we are happy to share what we have learned with anyone,who is interested in doing it. You can still be profitable. 
 We make sure that the telemedicine platform gives access,to expert medical specialists anywhere in the world,,just by a click of the button.,I'll lead you through, to see how this happens.,This is at the Heart Institute. The doctors from anywhere can log in.,I can call you in Switzerland and say, "Listen, go into our system.,Look at Mrs. Jones. Look at the study, tell me what you think.",They'll give me that information,,and we'll make the care of the patient better.,The patient doesn't have to travel.,He doesn't have to experience the anxiety of not knowing,because of limited expertise. 
 We also use [an] electronic medical record system.,I'm happy to say that the things we have implemented --,80 percent of U.S. practices do not have them, and yet the technology is there.,But you know, they have that luxury.,Because if you can't get it in Nashville, you can travel to Birmingham,,two hours away, and you'll get it. If you can't get it in Cleveland,,you can go to Cincinnati. We don't have that luxury,,so we have to make it happen.,When we do it, we will put the cost of care down.,And we'll extend it to the rural centers and make it affordable.,And everyone will get the care they deserve. 
 It cannot just be technology, we recognize that.,Prevention must be part of the solution -- we emphasize that.,But, you know, you have to tell people what can be done.,It's not possible to tell people to do what is going to be expensive,,and they go home and can't do it.,They need to be alive, they need to feed.,We recommend exercise as the most effective, simple, easy thing to do.,We have had walks every year -- every March, April.,We form people into groups and make them go into challenges.,Which group loses the most weight, we give them prizes.,Which groups record more walking distance by pedometer,,we give them prizes. We do this constantly.,We encourage them to bring children.,That way we start exposing the children from very early on,,on what these issues are. Because once they learn it, 
 they will stay with it. In doing this we have created,at least 100 skilled jobs in Jamaica alone,,and these are physicians with expertise and special training.,We have taken care of over 1,000 indigent patients that could have died,,including four free pacemakers in patients,with complete heart block. For those that understand cardiology,,complete heart block means certain death.,If you don't get this pacemaker, you will be dead.,So we are pleased with that. 
 Indirectly, we have saved the government of Jamaica five million dollars,from people that would have gone to Miami or Atlanta for care.,And we've hopefully saved a lot of lives.,By the end of this year, we would have contributed over one million dollars,in indigent care. In the first four months, it's been 340,000 dollars,,averaging 85,000 dollars a month. The government will not do that,,because they have competing needs.,They need to put resources elsewhere. But we can still do it.,People say, "How can you do that?" This is how we can do that.,At least 4,000 rich Jamaicans that were heading to Miami for treatment,have self-confessed that they did not go to Miami,because of the Heart Institute of the Caribbean.,And, if they went to Miami, they will spend significantly more --,eight to 10 times more. And they feel happy spending it at home,,getting the same quality of care.,And for that money -- for every one patient that has the money to pay,,it gives us an opportunity to take care of at least four people,that do not have the resources to pay.,(Applause) 
 For this to work, this progress must be sustainable.,So, we emphasize training. Training is critical.,We have gone further: we have formed a relationship,with the University of Technology, Jamaica,,where I now have an appointment.,And we are starting a biomedical engineering program,,so that we will train people locally, who can repair that equipment.,That way we're not going to deal with obsolescence and all those kinds of issues.,We're also starting ancillary health-care technology training programs --,training people in echocardiography, cardiac ultrasound,,those kinds of things. Now, with that kind of training,,it gives people motivation.,Because now they will get a bachelors degree in medical imaging,and all that kind of stuff. In the process, I want you to just hear,from the trainees themselves what it has meant for them. 
 (Video) Dr. Jason Topping: My name is Jason Topping.,I'm a senior resident in anesthesia in intensive care,at the University Hospital of the West Indies.,I came to the Heart Institute in 2006,,as part of my elective in my anesthesia and intensive care program.,I spent three months at the Heart Institute.,There's been no doubt around my colleagues,about the utility of the training I received here,,and I think there's been an increased interest now in --,particularly in echocardiography and its use in our setting. 
 Sharon Lazarus: I am an echocardiographer at the Heart Institute of the Caribbean,,since the past two years. I received training at this institution.,I think this aspect of training in cardiology,that the Heart Institute of the Caribbean has introduced in Jamaica,is very important in terms of diagnosing cardiac diseases. 
 Ernest Madu: The lesson in this is that it can be done, and it can be sustained,,and you can make it possible for everyone.,Who are we to decide that poor people cannot get the best care?,When have you been appointed to play God?,It is not my decision. My job is to make sure that every person,,no matter what fate has assigned to you, will have the opportunity,to get the best quality health care in life.,Next stop is West African Heart Institute,,that we are going to be doing in Port Harcourt, Nigeria,,as I said before. We will do other centers across West Africa.,We will extend the same system into other areas,,like dialysis treatment.,And anyone who is interested in doing it in any health care situation,,we will be happy to assist you and tell you how we've done it, 
 and how you can do it. If we do this,,we can change the face of health care in Africa.,Africa has been good to us; it is time for us to give back to Africa.,I am going. Those who want to come,,I welcome you to come along with me.,Thank you.,(Applause)I have a story, a story that I would like to share with you.,And it's an African story.,It is a story of hope, resilience and glamour. 
 There was Hollywood.,Then came Bollywood.,Today we have Nollywood, the third-largest film industry in the world.,In 2006 alone, almost 2,000 films were made in Nigeria.,Now, try to imagine 40, 50 films wrapped, distributed, every week,in the streets of Lagos, Nigeria and West Africa.,Some estimates put the value of this industry at 250 million dollars.,It has created thousands, if not tens of thousands of jobs.,And it's expanding.,But keep in mind that this was a grassroots movement.,This is something that happened without foreign investment,,without government aid, and actually, it happened against all odds,,in one of the most difficult moments in Nigerian economy.,The industry is 15 years old. 
 And so maybe you're thinking now,,why, how, an Italian filmmaker based in Boston,is so interested in this story?,And so I think I have to tell you just a few words,,a few things about my personal life,,because I think there is a connection.,My grandfather lived most of his life and is buried in Zambia.,My father also lived most of his adult life in East Africa.,And I was born in Zambia.,Even though I left when I was only three years old,,I really felt that Africa was this big part of my life.,And it really was a place where I learned to walk.,I think I uttered the first words,,and my family bought their first home.,So when we came back to Italy,,and one of the things that I remember the most,is my family having this hard time to share stories.,It seemed that for our neighbors and friends,,Africa was either this exotic place, this imaginary land,that probably exists only in their imagination,,or the place of horror, famine.,And so we were always caught in this stereotype.,And I remember really this desire to talk about Africa,as a place where we lived and people live and go about their lives,,and have dreams like we all have.,So when I read in a newspaper in the business page,the story of Nollywood,,I really felt this is an incredible opportunity to tell a story,that goes against all these preconceived notions. 
 Here I can tell a story of Africans making movies like I do,,and actually I felt this was an inspiration for me.,I have the good fortune of being a filmmaker-in-residence,at the Center of Digital Imaging Arts at Boston University.,And we really look how digital technology is changing,,and how young, independent filmmakers,can make movies at a fraction of the cost.,So when I proposed the story,,I really had all the support to make this film.,And not only had the support,,I found two wonderful partners in crime in this adventure.,Aimee Corrigan, a very talented and young photographer,,and Robert Caputo, a friend and a mentor,,who is a veteran of National Geographic,,and told me, "You know, Franco, in 25 years of covering Africa,,I don't know if I have come across a story,that is so full of hope and so fun." 
 So we went to Lagos in October 2005.,And we went to Lagos to meet Bond Emeruwa,,a wonderful, talented film director who is with us tonight.,The plan was to give you a portrait of Nollywood,,of this incredible film industry,,following Bond in his quest to make an action movie,that deals with the issue of corruption,,called "Checkpoint.",Police corruption.,And he had nine days to make it.,We thought this was a good story. 
 In the meantime, we had to cover Nollywood,,and we talked to a lot of filmmakers.,But I don't want to create too many expectations.,I would like to show you six minutes.,And these are six minutes they really prepared for the TED audience.,There are several themes from the documentary,,but they are re-edited and made for you, OK?,So I guess it's a world premier. 
 (Video),Man: Action.,Milverton Nwokedi: You cut a nice movie with just 10,000 dollars in Nigeria here.,And you shoot in seven days.,Peace Piberesima: We're doing films for the masses.,We're not doing films for the elite,and the people in their glass houses.,They can afford to watch their "Robocop" and whatever.,Mahmood Ali Balogun: I think filmmaking in Nigeria, for those who work in it,,is a kind of subsistence filmmaking -- what they do to make a living.,It's not the fancy filmmaking where you say,,oh, you want to put all the razzmatazz of Hollywood,,and where you have big budgets. 
 Here is that you make these films,,it sells, you jump onto the location again to make another film,,because if you don't make the next film, you're not going to feed.,Bond Emeruwa: So while we're entertaining, we should be able to educate. 
 I believe in the power of audiovisuals.,I mean, 90 percent of the population will watch Nollywood.,I think it's the most viable vehicle right now,to pass information across a dedicated cable.,So if you're making a movie, no matter what your topic is,,put in a message in there.,Woman: You still have to report the incident.,He needs proper medical attention.,PP: I keep trying to explain to people,,it's not about the quality at the moment -- the quality is coming.,I mean, there are those films that people are making for quality,,but the first thing you have to remember about this society,is that Africa still has people that live on one dollar a day,,and these are the people that really watch these films. 
 Sonny McDon W: Nollywood is a fantastic industry,that has just been born in this part of the world.,Because nobody believed that Nollywood can come out of Africa.,Lancelot Imasen: But our films,,they are stories that our people can relate to themselves.,They are stories about our people, for our people.,And consistently, they are glued to their screen,whenever they see the story.,Narrator: Suspense, fun and intrigue.,It's the blockbuster comedy.,You'll crack your ribs. 
 Bernard Pinayon Agbaosi: We have been so deep into the foreign movies.,It's all about the foreign movies.,But we can do something too.,We can do something, something that when the world sees it,,they say, wow, this is Nigeria.,Man: Just arrest yourself, sergeant.,Don't embarrass yourself.,Come on. Don't run away. Come back. Come back. 
 SMW: You can now walk the street and see a role model.,It’s not just what you see in picture.,You see the person live.,You see how he talks. You see how he lives.,He influences you really good, you know.,It’s not just what you see in the picture.,It is not what you hear, you know, from the Western press.,Man: See you. Bye.,Action. 
 Saint Obi: I was so fascinated, you know, with those cowboy movies.,But then when I discovered the situation in my country,,at that time there was so much corruption.,For a young man to really make it out here,,you got to think of some negative things and all that,,or some kind of vices.,And I didn't want that, you know.,And I discovered that I could be successful in life as an actor,,without doing crime, without cheating nobody, without telling no lies.,Just me and God-given talent.,Man: Let's go.,OK, it's time to kick some ass.,Cover this. It's your own.,Move it. 
 Roboger Animadu: In big countries, when they do the movies,,they have all these things in place.,But here, we improvise these items, like the gunshots.,Like they go, here, now, now, you see the gun there,,but you won't see any guns shot, we use knock-out.,Kevin Books Ikeduba: What I'm scared of is just the explosion will come up in my face.,Woman: That's why I use enough masking tape.,The masking tape will hold it.,Wat, wait. Just hold this for me.,KBI: I'm just telling her to make sure she places it well,so that it won't affect my face -- the explosion, you know.,But she's a professional. She knows what she’s doing.,I'm trying to protect my face too.,This ain't going to be my last movie.,You know, this is Nollywood, where the magic lives. 
 RA: So now you're about to see how we do our own movies here,,with or without any assistance from anybody.,Man: Action.,Cut.,(Applause) 
 Franco Sacchi: So many things to say, so little time.,So many themes in this story.,I just can't tell you -- there’s one thing I want to tell you.,I spent, you know, several weeks with all these actors, producers,,and the problems they have to go through are unimaginable,for, you know, a Westerner, a filmmaker who works in America or in Europe.,But always with a smile, always with an enthusiasm,,that is incredible. 
 Werner Herzog, the German filmmaker said,,"I need to make movies like you need oxygen.",And I think they’re breathing.,The Nigerian filmmakers really, really, are doing what they like.,And so it's a very, very important thing for them,,and for their audiences.,A woman told me, "When I see a Nollywood film,,I can relax, I really -- I can breathe better." 
 There is also another very important thing,that I hope will resonate with this audience.,It’s technology. I’m very interested in it,and I really think that the digital non-linear editing has slashed, you know,,the cost now is a fraction of what it used to be.,Incredible cameras cost under 5,000 dollars.,And this has unleashed tremendous energy.,And guess what?,We didn’t have to tell to the Nigerian filmmakers.,They understood it, they embraced the technology,and they run with it, and they’re successful.,I hope that the Nollywood phenomenon will go both ways.,I hope it will inspire other African nations to embrace the technology,,look at the Nigerian model, make their films, create jobs,,create a narrative for the population, something to identify,,something positive, something that really is psychological relief,and it's part of the culture.,But I really think this is a phenomenon that can inspire us.,I really think it goes both ways. 
 Filmmakers, friends of mine, they look at Nollywood and they say,,"Wow, they are doing what we really want to do,,and make a buck and live with this job.",So I really think it’s a lesson,that we're actually learning from them.,And there's one thing, one small challenge that I have for you,,and should make us reflect on the importance of storytelling.,And I think this is really the theme of this session.,Try to imagine a world where the only goal is food and a shelter, but no stories.,No stories around the campfire.,No legends, no fairytales.,Nothing.,No novels.,Difficult, eh? It's meaningless. 
 So this is what I really think.,I think that the key to a healthy society,is a thriving community of storytellers,,and I think that the Nigerian filmmakers really have proved this.,I would like you to hear their voices.,Just a few moments.,It’s not an added sequence, just some voices from Nollywood. 
 (Video) Toyin Alousa: Nollywood is the best thing that can happen to them.,If you have an industry that puts a smile on people's face,,that’s Nollywood.,SO: I believe very soon, we’re not only going to have better movies,,we'll have that original Nigerian movie.,BE: It’s still the same basic themes.,Love, action.,But we're telling it our own way, our own Nigerian way, African way.,We have diverse cultures, diverse cultures, there are so many,,that in the natal lifetimes,,I don't see us exhausting the stories we have. 
 FS: My job ends here, and the Nollywood filmmakers really have now to work.,And I really hope that there will be many, many collaborations,,where we teach each other things.,And I really hope that this will happen.,Thank you very much.,(Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: Stop. I've got two questions.,Franco, you described this as the world's third largest film industry.,What does that translate to in terms of numbers of films, really? 
 FS: Oh, yes. I think I mentioned briefly -- it's close to 2,000 films.,There is scientific data on this. 
 CA: 2,000 films a year?,FS: 2,000 films a year. 2005 or 6,,the censor board has censored 1,600 films alone.,And we know that there are more.,So it’s safe to say that there are 2,000 films.,So imagine 45 films per week.,There are challenges. There are challenges.,There is a glut of film,,the quality has to be raised, they need to go to the next level,,but I’m optimistic. 
 CA: And these aren’t films that are primarily seen in cinemas? 
 FS: Oh yes, of course. This is very important.,Maybe, you know, for you to try to imagine this,,these are films that are distributed directly in markets.,They are bought in video shops.,They can be rented for pennies. 
 CA: On what format? 
 FS: Oh, the format -- thank you for the question. Yes, it's VCDs.,It's a CD, it's a little bit more compressed image.,They started with VHS.,They actually didn't wait for, you know, the latest technology.,They started in '92, '94.,So there are 57 million VCRs in Nigeria,that play, you know, VHS and these VCDs.,It's a CD basically. It's a compact disc. 
 CA: So on the streets, are film casts ... ? 
 FS: You can be in a Lagos traffic jam,and you can buy a movie or some bananas or some water. Yes.,(Laughter),And I have to say, this really proves that storytelling,,it's a commodity, it's a staple.,There is no life without stories. 
 CA: Franco, thank you so much.You know, one of the things that I'd like to say upfront is that,I'm really here by accident.,And what I mean -- not at TED -- that I'm --,at this point in my life, truly my set of circumstances,I would truly consider an accident.,But what I'd like to talk to you about today,is perhaps a way in which we could use technology,to make those accidents happen often.,Because I really think, when I look back at how I actually ended up,in this accident, technology played a big role in that. 
 So, what I'd like to do today is tell you a little bit about myself,,because I'd like to put in context what I'm going to tell you.,And I think you will see why the two greatest passions in my life today,are children and education.,And once I put that in context,,I'd like to tell you a little bit about technology:,why I believe technology is a tremendous enabler;,a very powerful tool to help address some of these challenges.,Then, about the initiative that Chris mentioned,,that we decided to launch at AMD that we call 50x15.,And then I'll come back to the beginning,,and tell you a little bit more -- hopefully convince you --,that I believe that in today's world,,it is really important for business leaders,not only to have an idea of what their business is all about,,but to have a passion for something that is meaningful. 
 So, with that in mind, first of all let me tell you,,I'm one of five children. I'm the oldest, the other four are women.,So I grew up in a family of women.,I learned a lot about how to deal with that part of the world.,(Laughter),And, as you can imagine, if you can picture this:,I was born in a very small village in Mexico,,in, unfortunately, very poor surroundings,,and my parents did not have a college education.,But I was fortunate to be able to have one, and so were my four sisters.,That kind of tells you a little bit of an idea of the emphasis,that my parents placed on education.,My parents were fanatics about learning,,and I'll come back to that a little bit later. 
 But one of the things that exposed me early to learning,,and a tremendous curiosity that was instilled in me as a child,,was through a technology which is on the screen -- is a Victrola.,My father found that in a junkyard,,and was able to repair it and make it work. And somehow --,to this day, I frankly don't know how he was so aware,of what was going on in the world -- but,,by inviting me to sit down with him when I was only a few years old,,and playing records in this Victrola by Mozart, and he would tell me,how Mozart was the most romantic of all the classic composers ever,,and how Claire de Lune, which was one of his favorites,,was a real exposure to me to classical music.,He explained to me about Johann Strauss, and how he created the waltzes,that became so famous in the world.,And would tell me a little bit about history too,,when he'd play the 1812 Overture by Tchaikovsky,on this little Victrola, and he would tell me about Russia,and all the things that were happening in Russia at those times,and why this music,,in some way, represented a little bit of that history.,And even as a child, he was able to instill in me a lot of curiosity.,And perhaps to you this product may not look like high tech,,but if you can imagine the time when this occurred --,it was in the mid '40s -- this was really, in his view, a pretty piece of high tech. 
 Well, one of the things that is really critical to try to,distill from that experience is that in addition to that,,people ask me and say, "Well,,how did your parents treat you when you were a child?",And I always said that they were really tough on me.,And not tough in the sense that most people think of,,where your parents yell at you or hit you or whatever.,They were tough in the sense that, as I grew up,,both my mother and father would always say to me,,it's really important that you always remember two things.,First of all, when you go to bed at night,,you've got to look back on the day and make sure that you felt,the day was a day which you contributed something, and,that you did everything you could to do it the best way you could.,And the second thing they said: and we trust you,,that no matter where you are or where you go,,you will always do the right thing.,Now, I don't know how many of you have ever done that with your kids,,but if you do, please trust me,,it's the most pressure you can put on a child, to say --,(Laughter),-- we trust you that you will always do the right thing.,When I was out with my friends drinking beer,,I always was very aware of those words --,(Laughter) 
 -- and very careful. One of the things that has happened with technology,is that it can only be helpful if it is useful, of course,,but it can only be helpful too if it's accessible,,and it can only be helpful if it's affordable.,And in today's world, being useful, affordable and accessible,is not necessarily what happens,in a lot of the technology that is done today.,So, one of our passions in our company,,and now one of my personal passions, is to be able to really work hard,at making the technology useful, accessible and affordable.,And to me, that is very, very critical. 
 Now, technology has changed a lot since the Victrola days.,You know, we now have, of course, incredibly powerful computers.,A tremendous thing that people refer to as a killer app is called the Internet.,Although frankly speaking, we don't believe the Internet is the killer app.,What we believe is that the Internet, frankly,,is a connection of people and ideas.,The Internet happens to be just the medium,in which those people and ideas get connected.,And the power of connecting people and ideas can be pretty awesome.,And so, we believe that through all the changes that have occurred,,that we're faced today with a tremendous opportunity.,If we can connect people and ideas more intensely -- and although,you've seen a plethora and a myriad of products,that have come to the market today, the key to me is,how many of these products are able to provide people connectivity, in a useful way,,accessibility, in an easy manner,,and also affordability, that,regardless of the economic status that a person could have,,that they could have the opportunity to afford this technology. 
 So, when you look at that, we said, well, we would like to, then,,enable that a little bit. We would like to create an initiative.,And a couple of years ago at AMD,,we came up with this idea of saying,,what if we create this initiative we call 50x15,,where we are going to aim, that by the year 2015,,half of the world will be connected to the Internet,so that people and ideas can get connected.,We knew we couldn't do it by ourselves, and by no means,did we ever intend to imply that we at AMD could do it alone.,We always felt that this was something that could be done,through partnerships with governments, industry,,educational institutions, a myriad of other companies and, frankly, even competitors.,So, it is really a rather lofty initiative,,if you want to think that way,,but we felt that we had to put a real stake up in the years ahead,,that was bold enough and courageous enough,that it would force us all to think of ways to do things differently.,And I'll come back to that in a minute, because I think,the results so far have been remarkable,,and I can only anticipate and get real excited about,what I think is going to happen in the next eight years,,while we get to the 2015 initiative. 
 Where are we today?,That's year by year. This comes from our friends at Gapminder.com.,Those of you who've never looked at their website,,you should look at it. It's really impressive. And you can see,how the Internet penetration has changed over the years.,And so when we gave ourselves this scorecard to say,well, where are we related to our goal towards 2015,,the thing that becomes apparent is three pieces.,One is the Western world,,defined mostly by Western Europe and the United States,,has made an awful lot of progress.,The connectivity in these parts of the world,are really truly phenomenal and continue to increase. 
 As a matter of fact, we think reaching 100 percent is very doable,,even before the 2015 timeframe. In other parts of emerging countries,,such as India and China, the progress has been good --,has been solid, has been good. But in places that are not as developed,,places like Africa, Latin America and other places in the world,,the progress has been rather slow. As a matter of fact,,I was just recently visiting South Africa.,I had the opportunity to have a discussion with President Mbeki,,and one of the things that we talked about is, what is it,that's keeping this connectivity goal from moving ahead faster?,And one of the reasons is, in South Africa,,it costs 100 dollars a month to have a broadband connectivity.,It is impossible, even in the United States, for that cost,,to be able to enable the connectivity that we're all trying to reach.,So, we talked about ways in which perhaps one could partner,to be able to bring the cost of this technology down.,So, when you look at this chart,,you look at the very last -- it's a logarithmic chart on a horizontal scale --,you look at the very end:,we've got quite a long way to go to get to the 2015 goal of 50 percent.,But we're excited in our company; we're motivated.,We really think it's a phenomenal driver of things,,to force us to do things differently, and we look forward to being able to actually,,working with so many partners around the world,,to be able to reach that goal. 
 Now, one of the things I'd like to explain [about] 50x15,,which I think is really critical, is that it is not a charity.,It is actually a business venture.,Let's take a small segment of this, of this unconnected world,,and call it the education market.,When you look at elementary-school children,,we have hundreds and hundreds of millions of children around the world,that could benefit tremendously,from being able to be connected to the Internet.,Therefore, when we see that, we see an opportunity,to have a business that addresses the need of that segment.,And when we embarked in this initiative, from the very beginning,we said it very clearly: this is not a charity.,This is really a business venture,,one that addresses a very challenging segment of the market.,Because what we have learned in the last three years,is that this segment of the market, whether it's education,or under-developed nations, either way, it's a segment that demands,incredibly high quality, incredibly high reliability,,tremendous low cost and access, and a lot of challenges,that frankly, without actually doing it,,it would be very difficult to understand, and,I'll explain that in just a minute. 
 It is an initiative that is focused on simple, accessible and human-centric solutions.,What we mean by that is,,you know, frankly, the PC was invented in 1980, roughly speaking,more or less, and for 20-odd years, it hasn't changed.,It is still, in most places, a gray or black box, and it looks the same.,And frankly -- and I know that sometimes I offend some of my customers,when I say this, but I truly mean it --,if you could take the name of the computer off the top of it,,it would be very difficult to judge who made it,,because they're all highly commoditized but they're all different.,So, there has not been a human-centric approach,to addressing this segment of the market,,so we really believe it is critical to think of it. 
 It reminded me a lot of the talk we heard this morning, about this,operating room machinery that was designed specifically for Africa.,We're talking about something very similar here.,And it has to be based on a geo-sensitive approach.,What I mean by that is that in some parts of the world,,the government plays a key role in the development of technology.,In other parts, it doesn't.,In other parts of the world, you have an infrastructure,that allows for manufacturing to take place.,In other parts, it doesn't. And then we have to be sensitive,about how this technology can be developed,and put into action in those regions.,And the last piece, which is really important --,and this is an opinion that we have, not shared by many,,this is one where we seem to stand alone, on this one --,is that we really believe that the greatest success of this initiative,can come by fostering local, integrated, end-to-end ecosystems. 
 What I mean by that, and let me use this example,,the country of South Africa, because I was just there,,therefore I'm a little bit familiar with some of the challenges they have.,It's a country of 45 million people. It's an economy that's emerging.,It's beginning to grow tremendously.,They have an objective to lowering the cost of connectivity.,They have a computer company that makes computers in South Africa.,They're developing a software-training environment in their universities.,What a place, what an ideal place,to create an ecosystem that could build the hardware and the software,needed for their schools. And to my surprise, I learned in South Africa,they have 18 dialects, I always thought they only had two --,English and Afrikaans -- but it turns out they have 18 dialects.,And to be able to meet the needs of this rather complex educational system,,it could only be done from inside.,I don't think this segment of the market can be addressed,by companies parachuting from another place of the world,,and just dumping product and selling into the markets.,So, we believe that in those regions of the world,where the population is large,,and there's an infrastructure that can provide it,,that a local, integrated, end-to-end system,is really critical for its success. 
 This is a picture of a classroom that we outfitted with computers,in Mexico, in my home country.,This particular classroom happens to be in the state of Michoacan.,Those of you that might be familiar with Mexico --,Michoacan is a very colorful state.,Children dress with very colorful, colorful clothes,,and it is incredible to see the power that this has in the hands of kids,,in a computer. And I have to tell you that it's,so easy to appreciate the impact that access to technology,and connectivity can have in the lives and education of these kids.,We just recently opened a learning laboratory in a school,in the West Cape in South Africa,,in a school that's called Nelson Mandela School,,and when you see the faces and activities of these children,being able to access computers, it's just phenomenal.,And recently, they've written us letters,,telling us how excited they are about the impact,that this has had on their lives, on their educational dreams,,on their capabilities, and it's just phenomenal. 
 We have now deployed 30 different technologists,in 18 different countries, and we have been able,to connect millions of people in an effort to continue to learn,what this particular segment of the market needs and demands.,And I have to tell you that although,millions doesn't sound like a lot,in terms of the billions that need to be connected,,it's a start. And we are learning a lot.,And we're learning a tremendous amount about,what we believe this segment needs to be able to be effective. 
 One example of this has been the One Laptop per Child.,Some of you are familiar with this.,This is a partnership between MIT and a group of companies --,Google is involved, Red Hat -- and AMD is a key player.,The electronics behind the One Laptop per Child,are based on AMD technology; it's a microprocessor.,But to give you an idea how creative this group of people can be,,one of the objectives of the One Laptop per Child,is to be able to achieve a 10-hour battery life.,Because it was felt that a school day,would last at least eight hours, and,you wanted the child to have the ability to use the laptop,for at least one full day without having to recharge it.,The engineers have done a phenomenal amount of innovation on this part,,and battery life on this product is now 15 hours --,just through a lot of innovative work people have done,because they're passionate and motivated to be able to do this.,We expect this to be deployed towards the end of this year,,and we're very excited at the opportunities that this is going to offer,in the field of education.,It's a highly focused product aimed at strictly the education market,,not only in the developing countries, but actually,in the developed regions as well, because,there are parts of the United States where this can have,also a huge impact on the ability to make education more fun and more efficient. 
 We also have partnered with TED,in this project, with Architecture for Humanity,,and along with the TED Prize winner Cameron Sinclair,,we're having a contest that we have issued to the architectural community,to come up with the best design for a computer lab for an emerging region.,And we're really thrilled about the opportunity to be part of this,,and can't wait to see what comes out of this exciting, exciting activity. 
 Let me come back to the beginning,,to end this presentation.,I'll tell you that one of the things,that I feel is really critical for us in industry, in business,,is to be able to be passionate about solving these problems.,I don't think it's enough to be able to put them on a spreadsheet,,and look at numbers and say, yes, that's a good business.,I really believe that you have to have a passion for it. 
 And one of the things that I learned, too, from my parents --,and I'll give you a little anecdote -- especially from my father.,And it took me a while to understand it,,but he said to me, when I went to college, he said,,"You're the first person in the family to go to college.,And it's really important you understand,that for civilization to make progress,,each generation has to do better than the last one.,And therefore, this is your opportunity to do better than my generation.",Frankly, I don't know that I really understood what he told me at the time.,I was eager to go off to college, and go find girls, and study,,and girls, and study, but then I finished college and I fell in love.,I graduated. I decided to get married.,And on my wedding day, my father came to me again and said, "You know,,I'm going to remind you again, that each generation,has to do better than the last one.,You have to be a better husband than I was,,because that's how you make progress." And now he began to make sense.,Because I knew what a great husband he was,,and now he was once again beginning to put pressure on me,,like he did when I was a little kid. And then a few years later, I had a child,,my first child, and again, my father comes,to the hospital, and we're looking at the glass,,and see all the children on the other side, and he said,,"I've got to remind you again, that for each generation to do better,,you're going to have to be a better father than I was.",That's when it dawned on me the tremendous challenge,that he was placing on me, because he was a great father.,But the key is that he instilled in me a passion,to really get up every day in the morning and want to do better,,to really get up and think that my role in life,is not just to be the CEO of a Fortune 500 company.,It's got to be that someday I can look back,,and this place is truly better through some small contribution,that perhaps each of us could make.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)Good afternoon, good evening, whatever.,We can go, jambo, guten Abend, bonsoir,,but we can also ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.,That is the call that chimpanzees make,before they go to sleep in the evening.,You hear it going from one side of the valley to the other,,from one group of nests to the next. 
 And I want to pick up with my talk this evening,from where Zeray left off yesterday.,He was talking about this amazing, three-year-old Australopithecine child, Selam.,And we've also been hearing about the history, the family tree, of mankind,through DNA genetic profiling.,And it was a paleontologist, the late Louis Leakey,,who actually set me on the path for studying chimpanzees.,And it was pretty extraordinary, way back then.,It's kind of commonplace now,,but his argument was -- because he'd been searching,for the fossilized remains of early humans in Africa.,And you can tell an awful lot,about what those beings looked like from the fossils,,from the shape of the muscle attachments,,something about the way they lived,from the various artifacts found with them.,But what about how they behaved? That's what he wanted to know.,And of course, behavior doesn't fossilize.,He argued -- and it's now a fairly common theory --,that if we found behavior patterns similar or the same,in our closest living relatives, the great apes, and humans today,,then maybe those behaviors were present in the ape-like,,human-like ancestor some seven million years ago.,And therefore, perhaps we had brought those characteristics with us,from that ancient, ancient past. 
 Well, if you look in textbooks today that deal with human evolution,,you very often find people speculating about how early humans,may have behaved, based on the behavior of chimpanzees.,They are more like us than any other living creature,,and we've heard about that during this TED Conference.,So it remains for me to comment on the ways in which chimpanzees,are so like us, in certain aspects of their behavior. 
 Every chimpanzee has his or her own personality.,Of course, I gave them names. They can live to be 60 years or more,,although we think most of them probably don't make it to 60 in the wild.,Mr. Wurzel. The female has her first baby when she's 11 or 12.,Thereafter, she has one baby only every five or six years,,a long period of childhood dependency when the child is nursing,,sleeping with the mother at night, and riding on her back.,And we believe that this long period of childhood,is important for chimpanzees, just as it is for us, in relation to learning.,As the brain becomes ever more complex,during evolution in different forms of animals,,so we find that learning plays an ever more important role,in an individual's life history.,And young chimpanzees spend a lot of time watching what their elders do.,We know now that they're capable of imitating behaviors that they see.,And we believe that it's in this way,that the different tool-using behaviors -- that have now been seen,in all the different chimpanzee populations studied in Africa --,how these are passed from one generation to the next,,through observation, imitation and practice,,so that we can describe these tool-using behaviors as primitive culture. 
 Chimpanzees don't have a spoken language. We've talked about that.,They do have a very rich repertoire of postures and gestures,,many of which are similar, or even identical, to ours,and formed in the same context. Greeting chimpanzees embracing.,They also kiss, hold hands, pat one another on the back.,And they swagger and they throw rocks.,In chimpanzee society, we find many, many examples of compassion,,precursors to love and true altruism.,Unfortunately, they, like us, have a dark side to their nature.,They're capable of extreme brutality, even a kind of primitive war.,And these really aggressive behaviors, for the most part,,are directed against individuals of the neighboring social group.,They are very territorially aggressive.,Chimpanzees, I believe, more than any other living creature,,have helped us to understand that, after all, there is no sharp line,between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom. 
 It's a very blurry line, and it's getting more blurry all the time,as we make even more observations.,The study that I began in 1960 is still continuing to this day.,And these chimpanzees, living their complex social lives in the wild,,have helped -- more than anything else --,to make us realize we are part of, and not separated from,,the amazing animals with whom we share the planet.,So it's pretty sad to find that chimpanzees,,like so many other creatures around the world, are losing their habitats.,This is just one photograph from the air,,and it shows you the forested highlands of Gombe.,And it was when I flew over the whole area, about 16 years ago,,and realized that outside the park, this forest,,which in 1960 had stretched almost unbroken,along the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika,,which is where the tiny, 30-square-mile Gombe National Park lies,,that a question came to my mind.,"How can we even try to save these famous chimpanzees,,when the people living around the National Park are struggling to survive?",More people are living there than the land could possibly support.,The numbers increased by refugees pouring in from Burundi,and over the lake from Congo.,And very poor people -- they couldn't afford to buy food from elsewhere. 
 This led to a program, which we call TACARE.,It's a very holistic way of improving the lives,of the people living in the villages around the park.,It started small with 12 villages. It's now in 24.,There isn't time to go into it, but it's including things like tree nurseries,,methods of farming most suitable to this now very degraded,,almost desert-like land up in these mountains.,Ways of controlling, preventing soil erosion.,Ways of reclaiming overused farmland,,so that within two years they can again be productive.,Working to help the villagers obtain fresh water from wells.,Perhaps build some schoolrooms.,Most important of all, I believe,,is working with small groups of women,,providing them with opportunities for micro-credit loans.,And we've got, as is the case around the world,,about 95 percent of all loans returned.,Empowering women, working with education,,providing scholarships for girls so they can finish secondary school,,in the clear understanding that, all around the world,,as women's education improves, family size drops.,We provide information about family planning and about HIV/AIDS. 
 And as a result of this program,,something's happening for conservation.,What's happening for conservation is that the farmers living in these 24 villages,,instead of looking on us as a bunch of white people,coming to study a whole bunch of monkeys --,and by the way, many of the staff are now Tanzanian --,but when we began the TACARE program,,it was a Tanzanian team going into the villages.,It was a Tanzanian team talking to the villagers,,asking what they were interested in.,Were they interested in conservation? Absolutely not.,They were interested in health; they were interested in education.,And as time went on, and as their situation began to improve,,they began to understand ever more about the need for conservation.,They began to understand,that as the upper levels of the hills were denuded of trees,,so you've got this terrible soil erosion and mudslides. 
 Today, we are developing what we call the Greater Gombe Ecosystem.,This is an area way outside the National Park,,stretching out into all these very degraded lands.,And as these villages have a better standard of life,,they are actually agreeing to put,between 10 percent and 20 percent of their land in the highlands aside,,so that once again, as the trees grow back,,the chimpanzees will have leafy corridors,through which they can travel to interact --,as they must for genetic viability --,with other remnant groups outside the National Park.,So TACARE is a success.,We're replicating it in other parts of Africa,,around other wilderness areas,which are faced with extreme population pressure. 
 The problems in Africa, however, as we've been discussing,for the whole of these first couple of days of TED,,are major problems.,There is a great deal of poverty.,And when you get large numbers of people,living in land that is not that fertile,,particularly when you cut down trees,,and you leave the soil open to the wind for erosion,,as desperate populations cut down more and more trees,,so that they can try and grow food for themselves and their families,,what's going to happen? Something's got to give.,And the other problems -- in not only Africa,,but the rest of the developing world and, indeed, everywhere --,what are we doing to our planet?,You know, the famous scientist, E. O. Wilson,said that if every person on this planet,attains the standard of living of the average European or American,,we need three new planets.,Today, they are saying four. But we don't have them. We've got one. 
 And what's happened? I mean, the question here is, here we are,,arguably the most intelligent being that's ever walked planet Earth,,with this extraordinary brain,,capable of the kind of technology,that is so well illustrated by these TED Conferences,,and yet we're destroying the only home we have.,The indigenous people around the world,,before they made a major decision,,used to sit around and ask themselves,,"How does this decision affect our people seven generations ahead?",Today, major decisions -- and I'm not particularly talking about Africa here,,but the developed world --,major decisions involving millions of dollars,,and millions of people, are often based on,,"How will this affect the next shareholders' meeting?",And these decisions affect Africa. 
 As I began traveling around Africa,talking about the problems faced by chimpanzees and their vanishing forests,,I realized more and more how so many of Africa's problems,could be laid at the door of previous colonial exploitation.,So I began traveling outside Africa, talking in Europe,,talking in the United States, going to Asia.,And everywhere there were these terrible problems.,And you know the kind I'm talking about. I'm talking about pollution.,The air that we breathe that often poisons us.,The earth is poisoning our foods.,The water -- water is perhaps one of the most crucial issues,that we're going to face in this century --,and everywhere water is being polluted by agricultural,,industrial and household chemicals,that still are being sprayed around the world,,seemingly with the inability to profit from past experience.,The mangroves are being cut down;,the effects of things like the tsunami get worse.,We've talked about the soil erosion.,We have the reckless burning of fossil fuels,along with other greenhouse gasses, so called,,leading to climate change.,Finally, all around the world, people have begun to believe,that there is something going on very wrong with our climate. 
 All around the world climates are mixed up.,And it's the poor people who are affected worse.,It's Africa that already is affected.,In many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, the droughts are so much worse.,And when the rain does come, it so often leads to flooding,and added distress, and the cycle of poverty and hunger and disease.,And the numbers of people living in an area that the land cannot support,,who are too poor to buy food,,who can't move away because the whole land is degraded.,And so you get desertification -- creeping, creeping, creeping --,as the last of the trees are cut down.,And this kind of thing is not just in Africa. It's all over the world. 
 So it wasn't surprising to me,that as I was traveling around the world,I met so many young people who seemed to have lost hope.,We seem to have lost wisdom, the wisdom of the indigenous people.,I asked a question. "Why?",Well, do you think there could be some kind of disconnect,between this extraordinarily clever brain,,the kind of brain that the TED technologies exemplify,,and the human heart? Talking about it in the non-scientific term,,in terms of love and compassion. Is there some disconnect?,And these young people, when I talk to them,,basically they were either depressed or apathetic,,or bitter and angry. And they said more or less the same thing,,"We feel this way because we feel you've compromised our future,and there's nothing we can do about it." 
 We have compromised their future.,I've got three little grandchildren, and every time I look at them,and I think how we've harmed this beautiful planet since I was their age,,I feel this desperation.,And that led to this program we call Roots and Shoots,,which began right here in Tanzania,and has now spread to 97 countries around the world.,It's symbolic. Roots make a firm foundation.,Shoots seem tiny; to reach the sun they can break through a brick wall.,See the brick wall as all these problems we've inflicted on the planet,,environmental and social. It's a message of hope.,Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world,can break through and can make this a better world for all living things.,The most important message of Roots and Shoots:,every single one of us makes a difference, every single day.,We have a choice. Every one of us in this room,,we have a choice as to what kind of difference we want to make.,The very poor have no choice. It's up to us to change things,so that the poor have choice as well. 
 The Roots and Shoots groups all choose three projects.,It depends on how old they are, and which country,,whether they're in a city or rural, as to what kinds of projects.,But basically, we have programs now from preschool right through university,,with more and more adults starting their own Roots and Shoots groups.,And every group chooses, between them,,three different kinds of project to make this a better world,,recognizing that all these different problems are interconnected,and impinge on each other.,So one of their projects will be to help their own human community.,And then, if they're able, they may raise money to help communities,in other parts of the world.,One of their projects will be to help animals -- not just wildlife,,domestic animals as well.,And one of their projects will be to help the environment that we all share.,And woven throughout all of this is a message,of learning to live in peace and harmony within ourselves,,in our families, in our communities, between nations, between cultures,,between religions and between us and the natural world.,We need the natural world. We cannot go on destroying it at the rate we are.,We not do have more than this one planet. 
 Just picking one or two of the projects right here in Africa,that the Roots and Shoots groups are doing,,one or two projects only -- in Tanzania, in Uganda, Kenya,,South Africa, Congo-Brazzaville, Sierra Leone, Cameroon,and other groups. And as I say, it's in 97 countries around the world.,Of course, they're planting trees. They're growing organic vegetables.,They're working in the refugee camps, with chickens,and selling the eggs for a little amount of money,,or just using them to feed their families,,and feeling a sense of pride and empowerment,,because they're no longer helpless and depending on others,with their vegetables and their chickens.,It's being used in Uganda,to give some psychological help to ex-child soldiers.,Doing projects like this is bringing them out of themselves.,Once again, they're useful members of society.,We have this program in prisons as well.,So, there's no time for more Roots and Shoots now.,But -- oh, they're also working on HIV/AIDS.,That's a very important component of Roots and Shoots,,with older kids talking to younger ones.,And unwanted pregnancies and things like that,,which young people listen to better from other youth, rather than adults. 
 Hope. That's the question I get asked as I'm going around the world:,"Jane, you've seen so many terrible things,,you've seen your chimpanzees decrease in number,from about one million, at the turn of the century,,to no more than 150,000 now, and the same with so many other animals.,Forests disappearing, deserts where once there was forest.,Do you really have hope?" Well, yes.,You can't come to a conference like TED and not have hope, can you?,And of course, there's hope. One is this amazing human brain. 
 And I mean, think of the technologies.,And I've just been so thrilled, finally, to come to people talking about compost latrines.,It's one of my hobbyhorses.,We just flush all this water down the lavatory, it's terrible.,And then talking about renewable energy -- desperately important.,Do we care about the planet for our children?,How many of us have children or grandchildren, nieces, nephews?,Do we care about their future?,And if we care about their future, we, as the elite around the world,,we can do something about it. We can make choices as to how we live each day.,What we buy. What we wear.,And choose to make these choices with the question,,how will this affect the environment around me?,How will it affect the life of my child when he or she grows up?,Or my grandchild, or whatever it is.,So the human brain, coupled with the human heart,,and we join hands around the world.,And that's what TED is helping so well with, and Google who help us,,and Esri are helping us with mapping in Gombe National Park.,All of these technologies we can use. 
 Now let's link them, and it's beginning to happen, isn't it?,You've heard about it this afternoon. It's beginning to happen.,This change, this change. To see change,that we must have if we care about the future.,And the next reason for hope -- nature is amazingly resilient.,You can take an area that's absolutely destroyed,,with time and perhaps some help it can regenerate.,And an example is the TACARE program.,I told you, where a seemingly dead tree stump --,if you stop hacking them for firewood,,which you don't need to because you have wood lots,,then in five years you can have a 30-foot tree.,And animals, almost on the brink of extinction,,can be given a second chance. That's my next book.,It's inspiring. And it brings me to my last category of hope,,and we've heard about this so much in the last two days:,this indomitable human spirit. This determination of people,,the resilience of the human spirit,,So that people who you would think would be battered by poverty,,or disease, or whatever, can pull themselves up out of it,,sometimes with a helping hand, and take their part in society,,and take their part in changing the world. 
 And just to think of one or two people out of Africa who are just really inspiring.,We could make a very long list,,but obviously Nelson Mandela, emerging from 17 years,of hard physical labor, 23 years of imprisonment,,with this amazing ability to forgive, so that he could lead his nation,out the evil regime of apartheid without a bloodbath.,Ken Saro-Wiwa, in Nigeria, who took on the giant oil companies,,and although people around the world tried their best, was executed.,People like this are so inspirational.,People like this are the role models we need for young Africans.,And we need some environmental role models as well,,and I've been hearing some of them today.,So I'm really grateful for this opportunity to share this message,again, with everyone at TED.,And I hope that some of us can get together and talk about some of these things,,especially the Roots and Shoots program. 
 And just a last word on that --,the young woman who's running this entire conference center,,I met her today.,She came up so excited, with her certificate. She was [in] Roots and Shoots.,She was in the leadership in Dar es Salaam.,She said it's helped her to do what she's doing.,And it was very, very exciting for me to meet her,and see just one example of how young people,,when they are empowered, given the opportunity to take action,,to make the world a better place,,truly are our hope for tomorrow.,Thank you. 
 (Applause)My name is Joseph,na Member of Parliament in Kenya.,Picture a Maasai village,,and one evening,,government soldiers come,nsurround the village,and ask each elder to bringnone boy to school.,That's how I went to school --,pretty much a government guynpointing a gun,and told my father,n"You have to make a choice.",I walked very comfortablynto this missionary school,,that was run by an American missionary.,The first thing the American missionaryngave me was a candy.,I had never in my life ever tasted candy.,So I said to myself,nwith all these hundred other boys,,this is where I belong. 
 (Laughter) I stayed. 
 When everybody else was dropping out.,My family moved; we're nomads.,It was a boarding school, I was seven --,Every time it closednyou had to travel to find them.,40-50 miles, it doesn't matter.,You slept in the bush, but you kept going. 
 And I stayed. I don't know why, but I did.,All of a sudden I passednthe national examination,,found myself in a very beautifulnhigh school in Kenya.,And I finished high school.,And just walking, I found a man,who gave me a full scholarshipnto the United States.,My mother still lived in a cow-dung hut,,none of my brothers were going to school,,and this man told me, "Here, go." 
 I got a scholarship,to St. Lawrence University,nUpstate New York;,finished that.,And after that I wentnto Harvard Graduate School;,finished that.,Then I worked in DC a little bit:,I wrote a book for National Geographicnand taught U.S. history.,And every time, I kept going back home,,listening to their problems --,sick people, peoplenwith no water, all this stuff --,every time I go back to America,,I kept thinking about them. 
 Then one day, an elder gave mena story that went like this:,long time ago, there was a big warnbetween tribes.,This specific tribe was really afraidnof this other Luhya tribe.,Every time, they sent scoutsnto make sure no one attacked them.,So one day, the scouts came runningnand told the villagers,,"The enemies are coming.nOnly half an hour away, they'll be here.",So people scrambled, took their thingsnand ready to go, move out.,But there were two men:,one man was blind, one man had no legs,-- he was born like that.,The leader of the chiefs said, "No, sorry.nWe can't take you. You'll slow us down.,We have to flee our womennand children, we have to run.",And they were left behind, waiting to die. 
 But these two people worked something out.,The blind man said, "Look,nI'm a very strong man but I can't see.",The man with no legs says,n"I can see as far as the end of the world,,but I can't save myselfnfrom a cat, or whatever animals.",The blind man went downnon his knees like this,,and told the man with no legsnto go over his back, and stood up.,The man on top can see,nthe blind man can walk.,These guys took off, followednthe footsteps of the villagers,until they found and passed them. 
 So, this was told to menin a setup of elders.,And it's a really poor area.,I represent Northern Kenya:,the most nomadic, remote areasnyou can even find.,And that man told me, "So, here you are.,You've got a good education from America,nyou have a good life in America;,what are you going to do for us?,We want you to be our eyes,nwe'll give you the legs.,We'll walk you, you lead us." 
 The opportunity came.nI was always thinking about that:,"What can I do to help my people?,Every time you go to an areanwhere for 43 years of independence,,we still don't havenbasic health facilities.,A man has to be transportednin a wheelbarrow 30 km for a hospital.,No clean drinking water. 
 So I said, "I'm going to dedicate myself.,I'm leaving America.,I'm going to run for office.",Last June, I moved from America,,ran in July election and won.,And I came for them,,and that's my goal. 
 Right now I have in place,nfor the last nine months,,a plan that in five years,,every nomad will havenclean drinking water.,We're building dispensariesnacross that constituency.,I'm asking my friends from America to help,with bringing nursesnor doctors to help us out.,I'm trying to improve infrastructure.,I'm using the knowledgenI received from the United States,and from my community,to move them forward.,I'm trying to developnhomegrown solutions to our issues,because people from outsidencan come and help us,,but if we don't help ourselves,nthere's nothing to do. 
 My plan right now,as I continue with introducingnstudents to different fields --,some become doctors, some lawyers --,we want to producena comprehensive group of people,,students who can come backnand help us see a community grow,that is in the middlenof a huge economic recession. 
 As I continue to bena Member of Parliament,and as I continue listeningnto all of you talking about botany,,health, democracy, new inventions,,I'm hoping that one daynin my own little community --,which is 26,000 square km,,maybe five times Rhode Island --,with no roads,,we'll be able to become a modelnto help others develop. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I got my first computer when I was a teenager growing up in Accra,,and it was a really cool device.,You could play games with it. You could program it in BASIC.,And I was fascinated.,So I went into the library to figure out how did this thing work.,I read about how the CPU is constantly shuffling data back and forth,between the memory, the RAM and the ALU,,the arithmetic and logic unit.,And I thought to myself, this CPU really has to work like crazy,just to keep all this data moving through the system. 
 But nobody was really worried about this.,When computers were first introduced,,they were said to be a million times faster than neurons.,People were really excited. They thought they would soon outstrip,the capacity of the brain.,This is a quote, actually, from Alan Turing:,"In 30 years, it will be as easy to ask a computer a question,as to ask a person.",This was in 1946. And now, in 2007, it's still not true.,And so, the question is, why aren't we really seeing,this kind of power in computers that we see in the brain? 
 What people didn't realize, and I'm just beginning to realize right now,,is that we pay a huge price for the speed,that we claim is a big advantage of these computers.,Let's take a look at some numbers.,This is Blue Gene, the fastest computer in the world.,It's got 120,000 processors; they can basically process,10 quadrillion bits of information per second.,That's 10 to the sixteenth. And they consume one and a half megawatts of power.,So that would be really great, if you could add that,to the production capacity in Tanzania.,It would really boost the economy.,Just to go back to the States,,if you translate the amount of power or electricity,this computer uses to the amount of households in the States,,you get 1,200 households in the U.S.,That's how much power this computer uses. 
 Now, let's compare this with the brain.,This is a picture of, actually Rory Sayres' girlfriend's brain.,Rory is a graduate student at Stanford.,He studies the brain using MRI, and he claims that,this is the most beautiful brain that he has ever scanned.,(Laughter),So that's true love, right there.,Now, how much computation does the brain do?,I estimate 10 to the 16 bits per second,,which is actually about very similar to what Blue Gene does.,So that's the question. The question is, how much --,they are doing a similar amount of processing, similar amount of data --,the question is how much energy or electricity does the brain use?,And it's actually as much as your laptop computer:,it's just 10 watts.,So what we are doing right now with computers,with the energy consumed by 1,200 houses,,the brain is doing with the energy consumed by your laptop. 
 So the question is, how is the brain able to achieve this kind of efficiency?,And let me just summarize. So the bottom line:,the brain processes information using 100,000 times less energy,than we do right now with this computer technology that we have.,How is the brain able to do this?,Let's just take a look about how the brain works,,and then I'll compare that with how computers work.,So, this clip is from the PBS series, "The Secret Life of the Brain.",It shows you these cells that process information.,They are called neurons.,They send little pulses of electricity down their processes to each other,,and where they contact each other, those little pulses,of electricity can jump from one neuron to the other.,That process is called a synapse.,You've got this huge network of cells interacting with each other --,about 100 million of them,,sending about 10 quadrillion of these pulses around every second.,And that's basically what's going on in your brain right now as you're watching this. 
 How does that compare with the way computers work?,In the computer, you have all the data,going through the central processing unit,,and any piece of data basically has to go through that bottleneck,,whereas in the brain, what you have is these neurons,,and the data just really flows through a network of connections,among the neurons. There's no bottleneck here.,It's really a network in the literal sense of the word.,The net is doing the work in the brain.,If you just look at these two pictures,,these kind of words pop into your mind.,This is serial and it's rigid -- it's like cars on a freeway,,everything has to happen in lockstep --,whereas this is parallel and it's fluid.,Information processing is very dynamic and adaptive. 
 So I'm not the first to figure this out. This is a quote from Brian Eno:,"the problem with computers is that there is not enough Africa in them.",(Laughter),Brian actually said this in 1995.,And nobody was listening then,,but now people are beginning to listen,because there's a pressing, technological problem that we face.,And I'll just take you through that a little bit in the next few slides. 
 This is -- it's actually really this remarkable convergence,between the devices that we use to compute in computers,,and the devices that our brains use to compute.,The devices that computers use are what's called a transistor.,This electrode here, called the gate, controls the flow of current,from the source to the drain -- these two electrodes.,And that current, electrical current,,is carried by electrons, just like in your house and so on.,And what you have here is, when you actually turn on the gate,,you get an increase in the amount of current, and you get a steady flow of current.,And when you turn off the gate, there's no current flowing through the device.,Your computer uses this presence of current to represent a one,,and the absence of current to represent a zero. 
 Now, what's happening is that as transistors are getting smaller and smaller and smaller,,they no longer behave like this.,In fact, they are starting to behave like the device that neurons use to compute,,which is called an ion channel.,And this is a little protein molecule.,I mean, neurons have thousands of these.,And it sits in the membrane of the cell and it's got a pore in it.,And these are individual potassium ions,that are flowing through that pore.,Now, this pore can open and close.,But, when it's open, because these ions have to line up,and flow through, one at a time, you get a kind of sporadic, not steady --,it's a sporadic flow of current.,And even when you close the pore -- which neurons can do,,they can open and close these pores to generate electrical activity --,even when it's closed, because these ions are so small,,they can actually sneak through, a few can sneak through at a time.,So, what you have is that when the pore is open,,you get some current sometimes.,These are your ones, but you've got a few zeros thrown in.,And when it's closed, you have a zero,,but you have a few ones thrown in. 
 Now, this is starting to happen in transistors.,And the reason why that's happening is that, right now, in 2007 --,the technology that we are using -- a transistor is big enough,that several electrons can flow through the channel simultaneously, side by side.,In fact, there's about 12 electrons can all be flowing this way.,And that means that a transistor corresponds,to about 12 ion channels in parallel.,Now, in a few years time, by 2015, we will shrink transistors so much.,This is what Intel does to keep adding more cores onto the chip.,Or your memory sticks that you have now can carry one gigabyte,of stuff on them -- before, it was 256.,Transistors are getting smaller to allow this to happen,,and technology has really benefitted from that. 
 But what's happening now is that in 2015, the transistor is going to become so small,,that it corresponds to only one electron at a time,can flow through that channel,,and that corresponds to a single ion channel.,And you start having the same kind of traffic jams that you have in the ion channel.,The current will turn on and off at random,,even when it's supposed to be on.,And that means your computer is going to get,its ones and zeros mixed up, and that's going to crash your machine. 
 So, we are at the stage where we,don't really know how to compute with these kinds of devices.,And the only kind of thing -- the only thing we know right now,that can compute with these kinds of devices are the brain. 
 OK, so a computer picks a specific item of data from memory,,it sends it into the processor or the ALU,,and then it puts the result back into memory.,That's the red path that's highlighted.,The way brains work, I told you all, you have got all these neurons.,And the way they represent information is,they break up that data into little pieces,that are represented by pulses and different neurons.,So you have all these pieces of data,distributed throughout the network.,And then the way that you process that data to get a result,is that you translate this pattern of activity into a new pattern of activity,,just by it flowing through the network.,So you set up these connections,such that the input pattern just flows,and generates the output pattern. 
 What you see here is that there's these redundant connections.,So if this piece of data or this piece of the data gets clobbered,,it doesn't show up over here, these two pieces can activate the missing part,with these redundant connections.,So even when you go to these crappy devices,where sometimes you want a one and you get a zero, and it doesn't show up,,there's redundancy in the network,that can actually recover the missing information.,It makes the brain inherently robust.,What you have here is a system where you store data locally.,And it's brittle, because each of these steps has to be flawless,,otherwise you lose that data, whereas in the brain, you have a system,that stores data in a distributed way, and it's robust. 
 What I want to basically talk about is my dream,,which is to build a computer that works like the brain.,This is something that we've been working on for the last couple of years.,And I'm going to show you a system that we designed,to model the retina,,which is a piece of brain that lines the inside of your eyeball.,We didn't do this by actually writing code, like you do in a computer.,In fact, the processing that happens,in that little piece of brain is very similar,to the kind of processing that computers,do when they stream video over the Internet.,They want to compress the information --,they just want to send the changes, what's new in the image, and so on --,and that is how your eyeball,is able to squeeze all that information down to your optic nerve,,to send to the rest of the brain. 
 Instead of doing this in software, or doing those kinds of algorithms,,we went and talked to neurobiologists,who have actually reverse engineered that piece of brain that's called the retina.,And they figured out all the different cells,,and they figured out the network, and we just took that network,and we used it as the blueprint for the design of a silicon chip.,So now the neurons are represented by little nodes or circuits on the chip,,and the connections among the neurons are represented, actually modeled by transistors.,And these transistors are behaving essentially,just like ion channels behave in the brain.,It will give you the same kind of robust architecture that I described. 
 Here is actually what our artificial eye looks like.,The retina chip that we designed sits behind this lens here.,And the chip -- I'm going to show you a video,that the silicon retina put out of its output,when it was looking at Kareem Zaghloul,,who's the student who designed this chip.,Let me explain what you're going to see, OK,,because it's putting out different kinds of information,,it's not as straightforward as a camera.,The retina chip extracts four different kinds of information.,It extracts regions with dark contrast,,which will show up on the video as red.,And it extracts regions with white or light contrast,,which will show up on the video as green. 
 This is Kareem's dark eyes,and that's the white background that you see here.,And then it also extracts movement.,When Kareem moves his head to the right,,you will see this blue activity there;,it represents regions where the contrast is increasing in the image,,that's where it's going from dark to light.,And you also see this yellow activity,,which represents regions where contrast is decreasing;,it's going from light to dark.,And these four types of information --,your optic nerve has about a million fibers in it,,and 900,000 of those fibers,send these four types of information.,So we are really duplicating the kind of signals that you have on the optic nerve. 
 What you notice here is that these snapshots,taken from the output of the retina chip are very sparse, right?,It doesn't light up green everywhere in the background,,only on the edges, and then in the hair, and so on.,And this is the same thing you see,when people compress video to send: they want to make it very sparse,,because that file is smaller. And this is what the retina is doing,,and it's doing it just with the circuitry, and how this network of neurons,that are interacting in there, which we've captured on the chip. 
 But the point that I want to make -- I'll show you up here.,So this image here is going to look like these ones,,but here I'll show you that we can reconstruct the image,,so, you know, you can almost recognize Kareem in that top part there.,And so, here you go.,Yes, so that's the idea.,When you stand still, you just see the light and dark contrasts.,But when it's moving back and forth,,the retina picks up these changes.,And that's why, you know, when you're sitting here,and something happens in your background,,you merely move your eyes to it.,There are these cells that detect change,and you move your attention to it.,So those are very important for catching somebody,who's trying to sneak up on you. 
 Let me just end by saying that this is what happens,when you put Africa in a piano, OK.,This is a steel drum here that has been modified,,and that's what happens when you put Africa in a piano.,And what I would like us to do is put Africa in the computer,,and come up with a new kind of computer,that will generate thought, imagination, be creative and things like that.,Thank you.,(Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: Question for you, Kwabena.,Do you put together in your mind the work you're doing,,the future of Africa, this conference --,what connections can we make, if any, between them? 
 Kwabena Boahen: Yes, like I said at the beginning,,I got my first computer when I was a teenager, growing up in Accra.,And I had this gut reaction that this was the wrong way to do it.,It was very brute force; it was very inelegant.,I don't think that I would've had that reaction,,if I'd grown up reading all this science fiction,,hearing about RD2D2, whatever it was called, and just -- you know,,buying into this hype about computers.,I was coming at it from a different perspective,,where I was bringing that different perspective,to bear on the problem.,And I think a lot of people in Africa have this different perspective,,and I think that's going to impact technology.,And that's going to impact how it's going to evolve.,And I think you're going to be able to see, use that infusion,,to come up with new things,,because you're coming from a different perspective.,I think we can contribute. We can dream like everybody else. 
 CA: Thanks Kwabena, that was really interesting.,Thank you. 
 (Applause)The decorative use of wire in southern Africa,dates back hundreds of years.,But modernization actually brought communication,and a whole new material, in the form of telephone wire.,Rural to urban migration meant that newfound industrial materials,started to replace hard-to-come-by natural grasses. 
 So, here you can see the change,from use -- starting to use contemporary materials.,These pieces date back from the '40s to the late '50s.,In the '90s, my interest and passion for transitional art forms,led me to a new form,,which came from a squatter camp outside Durban. 
 And I got the opportunity to start working with this community,at that point, and started developing, really,,and mentoring them in terms of scale, in terms of the design.,And the project soon grew from five to 50 weavers in about a year.,Soon we had outgrown the scrap yards, what they could provide,,so we coerced a wire manufacturer to help us,,and not only to supply the materials on bobbins,,but to produce to our color specifications. 
 At the same time, I was thinking, well,,there's lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products,,away from the ethnic, a little bit more contemporary.,So I developed a whole range around -- mass-produced range --,that obviously fitted into a much higher-end decor market,that could be exported and also service our local market. 
 We started experimenting, as you can see, in terms of shapes,,forms. The scale became very important,,and it's become our pet project. It's successful,,it's been running for 12 years. And we supply the Conran shops,,and Donna Karan, and so it's kind of great. 
 This is our group, our main group of weavers.,They come on a weekly basis to Durban.,They all have bank accounts.,They've all moved back to the rural area where they came from.,It's a weekly turnaround of production.,This is the community that I originally showed you the slide of.,And that's also modernized today,,and it's supporting work for 300 weavers.,And the rest says it all. 
 Thank you very much.,(Applause)This is very strange for me, because I’m not used to doing this:,I usually stand on the other side of the light,,and now I'm feeling the pressure I put other people into. And it's hard ...,The previous speaker has, I think,,really painted a very good background as to,the impulse behind my work and what drives me, and my sense of loss,,and trying to find the answer to the big questions. 
 But this, for me, I mean, coming here to do this,,feels like -- there’s this sculptor that I like very much, Giacometti,,who after many years of living in France -- and learning, you know,,studying and working -- he returned home and he was asked, what did you produce?,What have you done with so many years of being away?,And he sort of, he showed a handful of figurines.,And obviously they were, "Is this what you spent years doing?,And we expected huge masterpieces!",But what struck me is the understanding that in those little pieces,was the culmination of a man’s life, search, thought, everything --,just in a reduced, small version.,In a way, I feel like that.,I feel like I’m coming home to talk about,what I’ve been away doing for 20 years.,And I will start with a brief taster of what I’ve been about:,a handful of films -- nothing much,,two feature films and a handful of short films.,So, we’ll go with the first piece. 
 (Video) Woman: "I destroy lives," mum said.,I love her, you know.,She’s not even my real mum.,My real mum and dad dumped me,and fucked off back to Nigeria.,The devil is in me, Court.,Court: Sleep.,Woman: Have you ever been?,Court: Where?,Woman: Nigeria.,Court: Never.,My mum wanted to,,couldn’t afford it.,Woman: Wish I could.,I have this feeling I’d be happy there.,Why does everyone get rid of me?,Court: I don't want to get rid of you.,Woman: You don't need me.,You’re just too blind to see it now. 
 Boy: What do you do all day?,Marcus: Read.,Boy: Don't you get bored?,And how come you ain't got a job anyway?,Marcus: I am retired.,Boy: So?,Marcus: So I've done my bit for Queen and country, now I work for myself.,Boy: No, now you sit around like a bum all day.,Marcus: Because I do what I like?,Boy: Look man, reading don't feed no one.,And it particularly don't feed your spliff habit.,Marcus: It feeds my mind and my soul.,Boy: Arguing with you is a waste of time, Marcus.,Marcus: You’re a rapper, am I right?,Boy: Yeah.,Marcus: A modern day poet.,Boy: Yeah, you could say that.,Marcus: So what do you talk about?,Boy: What's that supposed to mean?,Marcus: Simple. What do you rap about?,Boy: Reality, man.,Marcus: Whose reality?,Boy: My fuckin' reality.,Marcus: Tell me about your reality.,Boy: Racism, oppression, people like me not getting a break in life.,Marcus: So what solutions do you offer? I mean, the job of a poet is not just --,Boy: Man, fight the power! Simple: blow the motherfuckers out of the sky.,Marcus: With an AK-47?,Boy: Man, if I had one, too fuckin' right.,Marcus: And how many soldiers have you recruited to fight this war with you?,Boy: Oh, Marcus, you know what I mean.,Marcus: When a man resorts to profanities,,it’s a sure sign of his inability to express himself.,Boy: See man, you’re just taking the piss out of me now.,Marcus: The Panthers.,Boy: Panthers?,Ass kickin' guys who were fed up with all that white supremacist, powers-that-be bullshit,,and just went in there and kicked everybody's arse.,Fuckin’ wicked, man. I saw the movie. Bad! What? 
 Director 1: I saw his last film.,Épuise, right?,Woman 1: Yes.,D1: Not to make a bad joke, but it was really épuisé.,Epuisé -- tired, exhausted, fed up.,Director 2: Can you not shut up?,Now, you talk straight to me, what’s wrong with my films?,Let’s go.,W1: They suck.,Woman 2: They suck? What about yours?,What, what, what, what about, what?,What do you think about your movie?,D1: My movies, they are OK, fine.,They are better than making documentaries no one ever sees.,What the fuck are you talking about?,Did you ever move your fuckin' ass from Hollywood,to go and film something real?,You make people fuckin' sleep.,Dream about bullshit. 
 (Applause) 
 Newton Aduaka: Thank you. The first clip, really, is,totally trying to capture what cinema is for me,,and where I'm coming from in terms of cinema.,The first piece was, really, there's a young woman talking about Nigeria,,that she has a feeling she'll be happy there.,These are the sentiments of someone that's been away from home.,And that was something that I went through, you know, and I'm still going through.,I've not been home for quite a while, for about five years now.,I've been away 20 years in total.,And so it’s really --,it's really how suddenly, you know, this was made in 1997,,which is the time of Abacha -- the military dictatorship,,the worst part of Nigerian history, this post-colonial history.,So, for this girl to have these dreams,is simply how we preserve a sense of what home is.,How -- and it's sort of, perhaps romantic, but I think beautiful,,because you just need something to hold on to,,especially in a society where you feel alienated. 
 Which takes us to the next piece, where the young man,talks about lack of opportunity: living as a black person in Europe,,the glass ceiling that we all know about, that we all talk about,,and his reality.,Again, this was my -- this was me talking about --,this was, again, the time of multiculturalism in the United Kingdom,,and there was this buzzword -- and it was trying to say,,what exactly does this multiculturalism mean in the real lives of people?,And what would a child --,what does a child like Jamie -- the young boy -- think,,I mean, with all this anger that's built up inside of him?,What happens with that?,What, of course, happens with that is violence,,which we see when we talk about the ghettos,and we talk about, you know, South Central L.A. and this kind of stuff,,and which eventually, when channeled, becomes,,you know, evolves and manifests itself as riots --,like the one in France two years ago, where I live,,which shocked everybody, because everyone thought, "Oh well,,France is a liberal society.",But I lived in England for 18 years.,I've lived in France for about four, and I feel actually,thrown back 20 years, living in France.,And then, the third piece. The third piece for me is the question:,What is cinema to you? What do you do with cinema?,There's a young director, Hollywood director, with his friends --,fellow filmmakers -- talking about what cinema means.,I suppose that will take me to my last piece --,what cinema means for me.,My life started as a -- I started life in 1966,,a few months before the Biafran, which lasted for three years,and it was three years of war.,So that whole thing,,that whole childhood echoes and takes me into the next piece. 
 (Video) Voice: Onicha, off to school with your brother.,Onicha: Yes, mama.,Commander: Soldiers, you are going to fight a battle,,so you must get ready and willing to die.,You must get -- ?,Child Soldiers: Ready and willing to die.,C: Success, the change is only coming through the barrel of the gun.,CS: The barrel of the gun!,C: This is the gun.,CS: This is the gun.,C: This is an AK-47 rifle. This is your life.,This is your life. This is ... this is ... this is your life.,Ezra: They give us the special drugs. We call it bubbles.,Amphetamines.,Soldiers: Rain come, sun come, soldier man dey go.,I say rain come, sun come, soldier man dey go.,We went from one village to another -- three villages.,I don’t remember how we got there.,Witness: We walked and walked for two days.,We didn't eat.,There was no food, just little rice.,Without food -- I was sick.,The injection made us not to have mind.,God will forgive us.,He knows we did not know. We did not know! 
 Committee Chairman: Do you remember January 6th, 1999?,Ezra: I don’t remember. 
 Various Voices: You will die! You will die! (Screaming),Onicha: Ezra! (Ezra: Onicha! Onicha!),Various Voices: ♫ We don't need no more trouble ♫,♫ No more trouble ♫,They killed my mother.,The Mende sons of bastards.,(Shouting),Who is she?,Me.,Why you giving these to me?,So you can stop staring at me.,My story is a little bit complicated.,I’m interested.,Mariam is pregnant.,You know what you are?

 Committee Chairman: We hope that, with your help and the help of others, that this commission,will go a long way towards understanding the causes of the rebel war.,More than that, begin a healing process and finally to --,as an act of closure to a terrible period in this country’s history.,The beginning of hope.,Mr. Ezra Gelehun, please stand.,State your name and age for the commission.,Ezra: My name is Ezra Gelehun.,I am 15 or 16. I don’t remember.,Ask my sister, she is the witch, she knows everything.,(Sister: 16.),CC: Mr. Gelehun, I’d like to remind you you’re not on trial here,for any crimes you committed.,E: We were fighting for our freedom.,If killing in a war is a crime,,then you have to charge every soldier in the world.,War is a crime, yes, but I did not start it.,You too are a retired General, not so?,CC: Yes, correct.,E: So you too must stand trial then.,Our government was corrupt.,Lack of education was their way to control power.,If I may ask, do you pay for school in your country?,CC: No, we don’t.,E: You are richer than us.,But we pay for school.,Your country talks about democracy,,but you support corrupt governments like my own.,Why? Because you want our diamond.,Ask if anyone in this room have ever seen real diamond before?,No.,CC: Mr. Gelehun, I'd like to remind you, you're not on trial here today.,You are not on trial.,E: Then let me go.,CC: I can't do that, son.,E: So you are a liar. 
 (Applause) 
 NA: Thank you. Just very quickly to say that my point really here,,is that while we’re making all these huge advancements,,what we're doing, which for me, you know, I think we should --,Africa should move forward, but we should remember,,so we do not go back here again.,Thank you. 
 Emeka Okafor: Thank you, Newton. 
 (Applause) 
 One of the themes that comes through very strongly,in the piece we just watched is this sense of the psychological trauma of the young,that have to play this role of being child soldiers.,And considering where you are coming from,,and when we consider the extent to which it’s not taken as seriously,as it should be, what would you have to say about that? 
 NA: In the process of my research, I actually spent,a bit of time in Sierra Leone researching this.,And I remember I met a lot of child soldiers --,ex-combatants, as they like to be called.,I met psychosocial workers who worked with them.,I met psychiatrists who spent time with them,,aid workers, NGOs, the whole lot.,But I remember on the flight back on my last trip,,I remember breaking down in tears and thinking to myself,,if any kid in the West, in the western world,,went through a day of what any of those kids have gone through,,they will be in therapy for the rest of their natural lives.,So for me, the thought that we have all these children --,it’s a generation, we have a whole generation of children --,who have been put through so much psychological trauma or damage,,and Africa has to live with that.,But I’m just saying to factor that in,,factor that in with all this great advancement,,all this pronouncement of great achievement.,That’s really my thinking. 
 EO: Well, we thank you again for coming to the TED stage.,That was a very moving piece. 
 NA: Thank you. 
 EO: Thank you. 
 (Applause)So what's image got do with it?,And I must say, I think Emeka is trying to send,a lot of subliminal messages,,because I'm going to keep harping on some of the issues,that have come up.,But I'm going to try and do something different,,and try and just close the loop with some of my personal stories,,and try and put a face to a lot of the issues,that we've been talking about.,So, Africa is a complex continent full of contradictions,,as you can see.,We're not the only ones. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 And you know, it's amazing.,I mean, we need a whole conference,just devoted to telling the good stories about the continent.,Just think about that, you know?,And this is typically what we've been talking about,,the role that the media plays in focusing,just on the negative stuff.,Now, why is that a problem?,A typical disaster story:,disease, corruption, poverty.,And some of you might be standing here thinking,,saying, "OK, you know, Ory, you're Harvard-educated,,and all you privileged people come here, saying,,'Forget the poor people.,Let's focus on business and the markets, and whatever.' ",And they're all, "There's the 80 percent of Africans,who really need help." 
 And I want to tell you that this is my story, OK?,And it's the story of many of the Africans who are here.,We start with poverty.,I didn't grow up in the slums or anything that dire,,but I know what it is to grow up without having money,,or being able to support family.,Euvin was talking about bellwether signs.,The bellwether for whether our family was broke or not was breakfast.,You know, when things were good, we had eggs and sausages.,When things were bad, we had porridge.,And like many African families,,my parents could never save,because they supported siblings, cousins, you know, their parents,,and things were always dicey.,Now, when I was born, they realized they had a pretty smart kid,,and they didn't want me to go to the neighborhood school,,which was free. 
 And they adopted a very interesting,approach to education, which was,they were going to take me to a school that they can barely afford.,So they took me to a private, Catholic, elementary school,,which set the foundation for what ended up being my career.,And what happened was,,because they could afford it sometimes, sometimes not,,I got kicked out pretty much every term.,You know, someone would come in with a list,of the people who haven't paid school fees,,and when they started getting pretty strict,,you had to leave, until your school fees could be paid.,And I remember thinking, I mean,,why don't these guys just take me to a cheap school?,Because you know, as a kid,you're embarrassed and,you're sensitive, and everyone knows,you guys don't have money.,But they kept at it,,and I now understand why they did what they did. 
 They talk about corruption.,In Kenya, we have an entrance exam to go into high school.,And there's national schools, which are like the best schools,,and provincial schools.,My dream school at that time was Kenya High School,,a national school.,I missed the cutoff by one point.,And I was so disappointed, and I was like,,"Oh my God, you know, what am I going to do?",And my father said, "OK, listen.,Let's go and try and talk to the headmistress.,You know, it's just one point. I mean,,maybe she'll let you in if that slot's still there.",So we went to the school,,and because we were nobodies, and because we didn't have privilege,,and because my father didn't have the right last name,,he was treated like dirt.,And I sat and listened to the headmistress talk to him, saying,,you know, who do you think you are?,And, you know, you must be joking if you think,you can get a slot.,And I had gone to school with other girls, who were kids of politicians,,and who had done much, much worse than I did,,and they had slots there.,And there's nothing worse than seeing your parent,being humiliated in front of you, you know?,And we left, and I swore to myself,,and I was like, "I'm never, ever going to have,to beg for anything in my life.",They called me two weeks later, they're like,,oh, yeah, you can come now. And I told them to stuff it. 
 (Laughter) (Applause) 
 Final story, and I sort of have to speak quickly.,Disease.,My father, who I've been talking about, died of AIDS in 1999.,He never told anyone that he had AIDS,,his fear of the stigma was so strong.,And I'm pretty much the one who figured it out, because I was a nerd.,And I was in the States at the time,,and they called me. He was very sick, the first time he got sick.,And he had Cryptococcal meningitis.,And so I went on to Google, Cryptococcal meningitis, you know.,Because of doctor-patient privilege,,they couldn't really tell us what was going on.,But they were like, you know, this is a long-term thing.,And when I went online and looked at the infectious --,read about the disease,,I pretty much realized what was going on. 
 The first time he got sick, he recovered.,But what happened was that he had to be on medication,that, at that time -- Diflucan, which in the States,is used for yeast infections -- cost 30 dollars a pill.,He had to be on that pill for the rest of his life.,You know, so money ran out.,He got sick again.,And up until that time, he had a friend who used to travel to India,,and he used to import, bring him, could,get him a generic version of it.,And that kept him going.,But the money ran out.,He got sick again. He got sick on a Friday.,At that time, there was only one bank that had ATMs in Kenya,,and we could not get cash. The family couldn't get cash,for him to start the treatment until Monday.,The hospital put him on a water drip for three days.,And finally, we figured, well, OK,,we'd better just try and take him to a public hospital.,At least he'll get treated,while we try to figure out the money situation.,And he died when the ambulance was coming,to the hospital to take him. 
 And, you know, now, imagine if -- and I could go on and on --,imagine if this is all you know about me.,How would you look at me?,With pity, you know. Sadness.,And this is how you look at Africa.,This is the damage it causes.,You don't see the other side of me.,You don't see the blogger,,you don't see the Harvard-educated lawyer,,the vibrant person, you know?,And I just wanted to personalize that.,Because we talk about it in big terms,,and you wonder, you know, so what?,But it's damaging.,And I'm not unique, right?,Imagine if all you knew about William,was the fact that he grew up in a poor village.,And you didn't know about the windmill, you know?,And I was just moved.,I was actually crying during his presentation.,He was like, I try and I make.,I was like Nike should hire him, you know, "Just do it!" 
 (Laughter) 
 And this is, again, the point I'm trying to make.,When you focus just on the disasters --,(Laughter) (Applause),-- we're ignoring the potential.,So, what is to be done?,First of all,,Africans, we need to get better at telling our stories.,We heard about that yesterday.,We had some of them this morning.,And this is an example, you know,,blogging is one way of doing that.,Afrigator is an aggregator of African blogs,that was developed in South Africa.,So we need to start getting better.,If no one else will tell our stories, let's do it.,And going back to the point I was trying to make,,this is the Swahili Wikipedia.,Swahili is spoken by about 50 million people in East Africa.,It only has five contributors.,Four of them are white males -- non-native speakers.,The other person is -- Ndesanjo, if you're here, stand up --,is a Tanzanian, [the] first Swahili blogger.,He's the only African who's contributing to this. 
 People, please. We can't whine and complain,the West is doing this.,What are we doing?,Where are the rest of the Swahili speakers?,Why are we not generating our own content?,You know, it's not enough to complain. We need to act.,Reuters now integrates African blogs,into their coverage of Africa.,So, that's a start,,and we've heard of all their other initiatives.,The cheetah generation.,The aid approach, you know, is flawed.,And after all the hoopla of Live 8,,we're still not anywhere in the picture.,No, you're not. 
 (Laughter) 
 But the point I'm trying to make, though,,is that it's not enough for us to criticize.,And for those of you in the diaspora,who are struggling with where should I be,,should I move back,,should I stay?,You know, just jump.,The continent needs you.,And I can't emphasize that enough, you know.,I walked away from a job with one of the top firms in D.C.,,Covington and Burling, six figures.,With two paychecks, or three paychecks,,I could solve a lot of my family's problems.,But I walked away from that, because my passion was here,,and because I wanted to do things that were fulfilling.,And because I'm needed here, you know?,I probably can win a prize for the most ways,to use a Harvard Law School degree,because of all the things I'm doing. 
 One is because I'm pretty aggressive,,and I try and find, you know, opportunities.,But there is such a need, you know?,I'm a corporate lawyer most of the time,for an organization called Enablis,that supports entrepreneurs in South Africa.,We're now moving into East Africa.,And we give them business development services,,as well as financing loan and equity.,I've also set up a project in Kenya,,and what we do is we track the performance,of Kenyan MPs.,My partner, M, who's a tech guru, hacked WordPress.,It costs us, like, 20 dollars a month just for hosting.,Everything else on there is a labor of love.,We've manually entered all the data there.,And you can get profiles of each MP,,questions they've asked in parliament.,We have a comment function,,where people can ask their MPs questions.,There are some MPs who participate,,and come back and ask. 
 And basically, we started this because we were tired,of complaining about our politicians.,You know, I believe that accountability stems from demand.,You're not just going to be accountable,out of the goodness of your heart.,And we as Africans need to start challenging our leaders.,What are they doing?,You know, they're not going to change,just out of nowhere.,So we need new policies, we need --,where's that coming from, you know?,Another thing is that these leaders,are a reflection of our society.,We talk about African governments,like they've been dropped from Mars, you know?,They come from us.,And what is it about our society that is generating leaders that we don't like?,And how can we change that?,So Mzalendo was one small way we thought we could start,inspiring people to start holding their leaders accountable.,Where do we go from here?,I believe in the power of ideas.,I believe in the power of sharing knowledge. 
 And I'd ask all of you, when you leave here, please just share,,and keep the ideas that you've gotten out of here going,,because it can make a difference.,The other thing I want to urge you to do,is take an interest in the individual.,I've had lots of conversations about things I think,need to be happening in Africa.,People are like, "OK, if you don't do aid,,I'm a bleeding heart liberal, what can I do?",And when I talk about my ideas, they're like,,"BBut it's not scalable, you know.,Give me something I can do with Paypal.",It's not that easy, you know?,And sometimes just taking an interest in the individual,,in the fellows you've met, and the businesspeople you've met,,it can make a huge difference, especially in Africa,,because usually the individual in Africa,carries a lot of people behind them.,Practically. I mean, when I was a first-year student in law school,,my mom's business had collapsed, so I was supporting her.,My sister was struggling to get through undergrad.,I was helping her pay her tuition.,My cousin ran out of school fees, and she's really smart.,I was paying her school fees. 
 A cousin of mine died of AIDS, left an orphan,,so we said, well, what are we going to do with her?,You know, she's now my baby sister.,And because of the opportunities that were afforded to me,,I am able to lift all those people.,So, don't underestimate that.,An example. This man changed my life.,He's a professor. He's now at Vanderbilt.,He's an undergrad professor, Mitchell Seligson.,And because of him, I got into Harvard Law School,,because he took an interest.,I was taking a class of his, and he was just like,,this is an overeager student,,which we don't normally get in the United States,,because everyone else is cynical and jaded.,He called me to his office and said,,"What do you want to do when you grow up?",I said, "I want to be a lawyer.",And he was like, "Why? You know,,we don't need another lawyer in the United States.",And he tried to talk me out of it,,but it was like, "OK, I know nothing about applying to law school,,I'm poli-sci Ph.D.,But, you know, let's figure out what I need you to do,,what I need to do to help you out." 
 It was like, "Where do you want to go?",And to me at that time university --,I was at University of Pitts for undergrad,,and that was like heaven, OK,,because compared to what could have been in Kenya.,So I'm like, "Yeah, I'm just applying to Pitt for law school.",He was like, "Why? You know, you're smart,,you have all these things going for you.",And I'm like, "Because I'm here and it's cheap,,and you know, I kind of like Pittsburgh.",Like, that's the dumbest reason I've ever heard,for applying to law school.,And, you know, so he took me under his wing, and he encouraged me.,And he said, "Look, you can get into Harvard,,you're that good, OK?,And if they don't admit you, they're the ones who are messed up.",And he built me up, you know?,And this is just an illustration. 
 You can meet other individuals here.,We just need a push.,That's all I needed was a push to go to the next level.,Basically, I want to end with my vision for Africa, you know?,A gentleman spoke yesterday about the indignity,of us having to leave the continent,so that we can fulfill our potential.,You know, my vision is that my daughter,,and any other African child being born today,,can be whoever they want to be here,,without having to leave.,And they can have the possibility of transcending,the circumstances under which they were born.,That's one thing you Americans take for granted, you know?,That you can grow up, you know, not so good circumstances,,and you can move.,Just because you are born in rural Arkansas, whatever,,that doesn't define who you are.,For most Africans today, where you live, or where you were born,,and the circumstances under which you were born,,determine the rest of your life.,I would like to see that change,,and the change starts with us.,And as Africans, we need to take responsibility for our continent.,Thank you. 
 (Applause)Like many of you here, I am trying to contribute,towards a renaissance in Africa.,The question of transformation in Africa,really is a question of leadership.,Africa can only be transformed by enlightened leaders.,And it is my contention that the manner in which,we educate our leaders is fundamental,to progress on this continent.,I want to tell you some stories that explain my view.,We all heard about the importance of stories yesterday.,An American friend of mine this year volunteered as a nurse in Ghana,,and in a period of three months she came to a conclusion,about the state of leadership in Africa,that had taken me over a decade to reach.,Twice she was involved in surgeries,where they lost power at the hospital.,The emergency generators did not start.,There was not a flashlight, not a lantern, not a candle --,pitch black.,The patient's cut open, twice.,The first time it was a C-section.,Thankfully, baby was out -- mother and child survived. 
 The second time was a procedure that involved local anesthesia.,Anesthetic wears off. The patient feels pain.,He's crying. He's screaming. He's praying.,Pitch black. Not a candle, not a flashlight.,And that hospital could have afforded flashlights.,They could have afforded to purchase these things, but they didn't.,And it happened twice.,Another time, she watched in horror as nurses watched a patient die,because they refused to give her oxygen that they had.,And so three months later,,just before she returned to the United States,,nurses in Accra go on strike.,And her recommendation is,take this opportunity to fire everyone, start all over again.,Start all over again. 
 Now what does this have to do with leadership?,You see, the folks at the ministry of health,,the hospital administrators, the doctors, the nurses --,they are among just five percent of their peers,who get an education after secondary school.,They are the elite. They are our leaders.,Their decisions, their actions matter.,And when they fail, a nation literally suffers.,So when I speak of leadership,,I'm not talking about just political leaders.,We've heard a lot about that.,I'm talking about the elite.,Those who've been trained,,whose job it is to be the guardians of their society.,The lawyers, the judges, the policemen, the doctors,,the engineers, the civil servants --,those are the leaders.,And we need to train them right. 
 Now, my first pointed and memorable experience with leadership in Ghana,occurred when I was 16 years old.,We had just had a military coup,,and soldiers were pervasive in our society.,They were a pervasive presence.,And one day I go to the airport to meet my father,,and as I walk up this grassy slope from the car park,to the terminal building,,I'm stopped by two soldiers wielding AK-47 assault weapons.,And they asked me to join a crowd of people,that were running up and down this embankment.,Why? Because the path I had taken was considered out of bounds.,No sign to this effect. 
 Now, I was 16. I was very worried about,what my peers at school might think,if they saw me running up and down this hill.,I was especially concerned of what the girls might think.,And so I started to argue with these men.,It was a little reckless, but you know, I was 16.,I got lucky.,A Ghana Airways pilot falls into the same predicament.,Because of his uniform they speak to him differently,,and they explain to him that they're just following orders.,So he takes their radio, talks to their boss,,and gets us all released.,What lessons would you take from an experience like this?,Several, for me.,Leadership matters. Those men are following,the orders of a superior officer.,I learned something about courage.,It was important not to look at those guns.,And I also learned that it can be helpful to think about girls. 
 (Laughter) 
 So a few years after this event, I leave Ghana on a scholarship,to go to Swarthmore College for my education.,It was a breath of fresh air.,You know, the faculty there didn't want us to memorize information,and repeat back to them as I was used to back in Ghana.,They wanted us to think critically.,They wanted us to be analytical.,They wanted us to be concerned about social issues.,In my economics classes I got high marks,for my understanding of basic economics.,But I learned something more profound than that,,which is that the leaders -- the managers of Ghana's economy --,were making breathtakingly bad decisions,that had brought our economy to the brink of collapse.,And so here was this lesson again -- leadership matters.,It matters a great deal. 
 But I didn't really fully understand what had happened to me at Swarthmore.,I had an inkling,,but I didn't fully realize it until I went out into the workplace,and I went to work at Microsoft Corporation.,And I was part of this team -- this thinking, learning team,whose job it was to design and implement new software,that created value in the world.,And it was brilliant to be part of this team.,It was brilliant.,And I realized just what had happened to me at Swarthmore,,this transformation --,the ability to confront problems, complex problems,,and to design solutions to those problems.,The ability to create is the most empowering thing,that can happen to an individual.,And I was part of that. 
 Now, while I was at Microsoft, the annual revenues of that company,grew larger than the GDP of the Republic of Ghana.,And by the way, it's continued to.,The gap has widened since I left.,Now, I've already spoken about one of the reasons why this has occurred.,I mean, it's the people there who are so hardworking,,persistent, creative, empowered.,But there were also some external factors:,free markets, the rule of law, infrastructure.,These things were provided by institutions,run by the people that I call leaders.,And those leaders did not emerge spontaneously.,Somebody trained them to do the work that they do.,Now, while I was at Microsoft, this funny thing happened.,I became a parent.,And for the first time, Africa mattered more to me than ever before.,Because I realized that the state of the African continent,would matter to my children and their children.,That the state of the world -- the state of the world,depends on what's happening to Africa,,as far as my kids would be concerned. 
 And at this time, when I was going through,what I call my "pre-mid-life crisis,",Africa was a mess.,Somalia had disintegrated into anarchy.,Rwanda was in the throes of this genocidal war.,And it seemed to me that that was the wrong direction,,and I needed to be back helping.,I couldn't just stay in Seattle and raise my kids,in an upper-middle class neighborhood and feel good about it.,This was not the world that I'd want my children to grow up in.,So I decided to get engaged, and the first thing that I did,was to come back to Ghana and talk with a lot of people,and really try to understand what the real issues were.,And three things kept coming up for every problem:,corruption, weak institutions,and the people who run them -- the leaders. 
 Now, I was a little scared,because when you see those three problems,,they seem really hard to deal with.,And they might say, "Look, don't even try.",But, for me, I asked the question,,"Well, where are these leaders coming from?,What is it about Ghana that produces leaders,that are unethical or unable to solve problems?",So I went to look at what was happening in our educational system.,And it was the same -- learning by rote --,from primary school through graduate school.,Very little emphasis on ethics,,and the typical graduate,from a university in Ghana has a stronger sense,of entitlement than a sense of responsibility.,This is wrong. 
 So I decided to engage this particular problem.,Because it seems to me that every society, every society,,must be very intentional about how it trains its leaders.,And Ghana was not paying enough attention.,And this is true across sub-Saharan Africa, actually.,So this is what I'm doing now.,I'm trying to bring the experience that I had at Swarthmore to Africa.,I wish there was a liberal arts college in every African country.,I think it would make a huge difference.,And what Ashesi University is trying to do,is to train a new generation of ethical, entrepreneurial leaders.,We're trying to train leaders of exceptional integrity,,who have the ability to confront the complex problems,,ask the right questions, and come up with workable solutions. 
 I'll admit that there are times when it seems like "Mission: Impossible,",but we must believe that these kids are smart.,That if we involve them in their education,,if we have them discuss the real issues that they confront --,that our whole society confronts --,and if we give them skills that enable them to engage the real world,,that magic will happen.,Now, a month into this project, we'd just started classes.,And a month into it, I come to the office,,and I have this email from one of our students.,And it said, very simply, "I am thinking now.",And he signs off, "Thank you.",It's such a simple statement.,But I was moved almost to tears,because I understood what was happening to this young man.,And it is an awesome thing to be a part,of empowering someone in this way.,I am thinking now. 
 This year we challenged our students,to craft an honor code themselves.,There's a very vibrant debate going on on campus now,over whether they should have an honor code,,and if so, what it should look like.,One of the students asked a question that just warmed my heart.,Can we create a perfect society?,Her understanding that a student-crafted honor code,constitutes a reach towards perfection is incredible.,Now, we cannot achieve perfection,,but if we reach for it, then we can achieve excellence.,I don't know ultimately what they will do.,I don't know whether they will decide to have this honor code.,But the conversation they're having now --,about what their good society should look like,,what their excellent society should look like,,is a really good thing. 
 Am I out of time? OK.,Now, I just wanted to leave that slide up,because it's important that we think about it.,I'm very excited about the fact,that every student at Ashesi University does community service before they graduate.,That for many of them, it has been a life-altering experience.,These young future leaders are beginning to understand,the real business of leadership,,the real privilege of leadership,,which is after all to serve humanity.,I am even more thrilled by the fact that least year,our student body elected a woman,to be the head of Student Government.,It's the first time in the history of Ghana,that a woman has been elected head of Student Government,at any university.,It says a lot about her.,It says a lot about the culture that's forming on campus.,It says a lot about her peers who elected her.,She won with 75 percent of the vote. 
 And it gives me a lot of hope.,It turns out that corporate West Africa,also appreciates what's happening with our students.,We've graduated two classes of students to date.,And every single one of them has been placed.,And we're getting great reports back,from corporate Ghana, corporate West Africa,,and the things that they're most impressed about is work ethic.,You know, that passion for what they're doing.,The persistence, their ability to deal with ambiguity,,their ability to tackle problems that they haven't seen before.,This is good because,over the past five years, there have been times,when I've felt this is "Mission: Impossible." 
 And it's just wonderful to see these glimmers,of the promise of what can happen if we train our kids right.,I think that the current and future leaders of Africa,have an incredible opportunity,to drive a major renaissance on the continent.,It's an incredible opportunity.,There aren't very many more opportunities like this in the world.,I believe that Africa has reached an inflection point,with a march of democracy and free markets across the continent.,We have reached a moment from which can emerge,a great society within one generation.,It will depend on inspired leadership.,And it is my contention that the manner in which we train our leaders,will make all the difference.,Thank you, and God bless. 
 (Applause)I want to start my story in Germany, in 1877,,with a mathematician named Georg Cantor.,And Cantor decided he was going to take a line and erase the middle third of the line,,and then take those two resulting lines and bring them back into the same process, a recursive process.,So he starts out with one line, and then two,,and then four, and then 16, and so on.,And if he does this an infinite number of times, which you can do in mathematics,,he ends up with an infinite number of lines,,each of which has an infinite number of points in it.,So he realized he had a set whose number of elements was larger than infinity.,And this blew his mind. Literally. He checked into a sanitarium. (Laughter),And when he came out of the sanitarium,,he was convinced that he had been put on earth to found transfinite set theory,because the largest set of infinity would be God Himself.,He was a very religious man.,He was a mathematician on a mission. 
 And other mathematicians did the same sort of thing.,A Swedish mathematician, von Koch,,decided that instead of subtracting lines, he would add them.,And so he came up with this beautiful curve.,And there's no particular reason why we have to start with this seed shape;,we can use any seed shape we like.,And I'll rearrange this and I'll stick this somewhere -- down there, OK --,and now upon iteration, that seed shape sort of unfolds into a very different looking structure.,So these all have the property of self-similarity:,the part looks like the whole.,It's the same pattern at many different scales. 
 Now, mathematicians thought this was very strange,because as you shrink a ruler down, you measure a longer and longer length.,And since they went through the iterations an infinite number of times,,as the ruler shrinks down to infinity, the length goes to infinity.,This made no sense at all,,so they consigned these curves to the back of the math books.,They said these are pathological curves, and we don't have to discuss them.,(Laughter),And that worked for a hundred years. 
 And then in 1977, Benoit Mandelbrot, a French mathematician,,realized that if you do computer graphics and used these shapes he called fractals,,you get the shapes of nature.,You get the human lungs, you get acacia trees, you get ferns,,you get these beautiful natural forms.,If you take your thumb and your index finger and look right where they meet --,go ahead and do that now --,-- and relax your hand, you'll see a crinkle,,and then a wrinkle within the crinkle, and a crinkle within the wrinkle. Right?,Your body is covered with fractals.,The mathematicians who were saying these were pathologically useless shapes?,They were breathing those words with fractal lungs.,It's very ironic. And I'll show you a little natural recursion here.,Again, we just take these lines and recursively replace them with the whole shape.,So here's the second iteration, and the third, fourth and so on. 
 So nature has this self-similar structure.,Nature uses self-organizing systems.,Now in the 1980s, I happened to notice,that if you look at an aerial photograph of an African village, you see fractals.,And I thought, "This is fabulous! I wonder why?",And of course I had to go to Africa and ask folks why.,So I got a Fulbright scholarship to just travel around Africa for a year,asking people why they were building fractals,,which is a great job if you can get it.,(Laughter) 
 And so I finally got to this city, and I'd done a little fractal model for the city,just to see how it would sort of unfold --,but when I got there, I got to the palace of the chief,,and my French is not very good; I said something like,,"I am a mathematician and I would like to stand on your roof.",But he was really cool about it, and he took me up there,,and we talked about fractals.,And he said, "Oh yeah, yeah! We knew about a rectangle within a rectangle,,we know all about that.",And it turns out the royal insignia has a rectangle within a rectangle within a rectangle,,and the path through that palace is actually this spiral here.,And as you go through the path, you have to get more and more polite.,So they're mapping the social scaling onto the geometric scaling;,it's a conscious pattern. It is not unconscious like a termite mound fractal. 
 This is a village in southern Zambia.,The Ba-ila built this village about 400 meters in diameter.,You have a huge ring.,The rings that represent the family enclosures get larger and larger as you go towards the back,,and then you have the chief's ring here towards the back,and then the chief's immediate family in that ring.,So here's a little fractal model for it.,Here's one house with the sacred altar,,here's the house of houses, the family enclosure,,with the humans here where the sacred altar would be,,and then here's the village as a whole --,a ring of ring of rings with the chief's extended family here, the chief's immediate family here,,and here there's a tiny village only this big.,Now you might wonder, how can people fit in a tiny village only this big?,That's because they're spirit people. It's the ancestors.,And of course the spirit people have a little miniature village in their village, right?,So it's just like Georg Cantor said, the recursion continues forever. 
 This is in the Mandara mountains, near the Nigerian border in Cameroon, Mokoulek.,I saw this diagram drawn by a French architect,,and I thought, "Wow! What a beautiful fractal!",So I tried to come up with a seed shape, which, upon iteration, would unfold into this thing.,I came up with this structure here.,Let's see, first iteration, second, third, fourth.,Now, after I did the simulation,,I realized the whole village kind of spirals around, just like this,,and here's that replicating line -- a self-replicating line that unfolds into the fractal.,Well, I noticed that line is about where the only square building in the village is at.,So, when I got to the village,,I said, "Can you take me to the square building?,I think something's going on there.",And they said, "Well, we can take you there, but you can't go inside,because that's the sacred altar, where we do sacrifices every year,to keep up those annual cycles of fertility for the fields.",And I started to realize that the cycles of fertility,were just like the recursive cycles in the geometric algorithm that builds this.,And the recursion in some of these villages continues down into very tiny scales. 
 So here's a Nankani village in Mali.,And you can see, you go inside the family enclosure --,you go inside and here's pots in the fireplace, stacked recursively.,Here's calabashes that Issa was just showing us,,and they're stacked recursively.,Now, the tiniest calabash in here keeps the woman's soul.,And when she dies, they have a ceremony,where they break this stack called the zalanga and her soul goes off to eternity.,Once again, infinity is important. 
 Now, you might ask yourself three questions at this point.,Aren't these scaling patterns just universal to all indigenous architecture?,And that was actually my original hypothesis.,When I first saw those African fractals,,I thought, "Wow, so any indigenous group that doesn't have a state society,,that sort of hierarchy, must have a kind of bottom-up architecture.",But that turns out not to be true. 
 I started collecting aerial photographs of Native American and South Pacific architecture;,only the African ones were fractal.,And if you think about it, all these different societies have different geometric design themes that they use.,So Native Americans use a combination of circular symmetry and fourfold symmetry.,You can see on the pottery and the baskets.,Here's an aerial photograph of one of the Anasazi ruins;,you can see it's circular at the largest scale, but it's rectangular at the smaller scale, right?,It is not the same pattern at two different scales. 
 Second, you might ask,,"Well, Dr. Eglash, aren't you ignoring the diversity of African cultures?",And three times, the answer is no.,First of all, I agree with Mudimbe's wonderful book, "The Invention of Africa,",that Africa is an artificial invention of first colonialism,,and then oppositional movements.,No, because a widely shared design practice doesn't necessarily give you a unity of culture --,and it definitely is not "in the DNA.",And finally, the fractals have self-similarity --,so they're similar to themselves, but they're not necessarily similar to each other --,you see very different uses for fractals.,It's a shared technology in Africa. 
 And finally, well, isn't this just intuition?,It's not really mathematical knowledge.,Africans can't possibly really be using fractal geometry, right?,It wasn't invented until the 1970s.,Well, it's true that some African fractals are, as far as I'm concerned, just pure intuition.,So some of these things, I'd wander around the streets of Dakar,asking people, "What's the algorithm? What's the rule for making this?",and they'd say,,"Well, we just make it that way because it looks pretty, stupid." (Laughter),But sometimes, that's not the case.,In some cases, there would actually be algorithms, and very sophisticated algorithms.,So in Manghetu sculpture, you'd see this recursive geometry.,In Ethiopian crosses, you see this wonderful unfolding of the shape. 
 In Angola, the Chokwe people draw lines in the sand,,and it's what the German mathematician Euler called a graph;,we now call it an Eulerian path --,you can never lift your stylus from the surface,and you can never go over the same line twice.,But they do it recursively, and they do it with an age-grade system,,so the little kids learn this one, and then the older kids learn this one,,then the next age-grade initiation, you learn this one.,And with each iteration of that algorithm,,you learn the iterations of the myth.,You learn the next level of knowledge. 
 And finally, all over Africa, you see this board game.,It's called Owari in Ghana, where I studied it;,it's called Mancala here on the East Coast, Bao in Kenya, Sogo elsewhere.,Well, you see self-organizing patterns that spontaneously occur in this board game.,And the folks in Ghana knew about these self-organizing patterns,and would use them strategically.,So this is very conscious knowledge. 
 Here's a wonderful fractal.,Anywhere you go in the Sahel, you'll see this windscreen.,And of course fences around the world are all Cartesian, all strictly linear.,But here in Africa, you've got these nonlinear scaling fences.,So I tracked down one of the folks who makes these things,,this guy in Mali just outside of Bamako, and I asked him,,"How come you're making fractal fences? Because nobody else is.",And his answer was very interesting.,He said, "Well, if I lived in the jungle, I would only use the long rows of straw,because they're very quick and they're very cheap.,It doesn't take much time, doesn't take much straw.",He said, "but wind and dust goes through pretty easily.,Now, the tight rows up at the very top, they really hold out the wind and dust.,But it takes a lot of time, and it takes a lot of straw because they're really tight.","Now," he said, "we know from experience,that the farther up from the ground you go, the stronger the wind blows.",Right? It's just like a cost-benefit analysis.,And I measured out the lengths of straw,,put it on a log-log plot, got the scaling exponent,,and it almost exactly matches the scaling exponent for the relationship between wind speed and height,in the wind engineering handbook.,So these guys are right on target for a practical use of scaling technology. 
 The most complex example of an algorithmic approach to fractals that I found,was actually not in geometry, it was in a symbolic code,,and this was Bamana sand divination.,And the same divination system is found all over Africa.,You can find it on the East Coast as well as the West Coast,,and often the symbols are very well preserved,,so each of these symbols has four bits -- it's a four-bit binary word --,you draw these lines in the sand randomly, and then you count off,,and if it's an odd number, you put down one stroke,,and if it's an even number, you put down two strokes.,And they did this very rapidly,,and I couldn't understand where they were getting --,they only did the randomness four times --,I couldn't understand where they were getting the other 12 symbols.,And they wouldn't tell me.,They said, "No, no, I can't tell you about this.",And I said, "Well look, I'll pay you, you can be my teacher,,and I'll come each day and pay you.",They said, "It's not a matter of money. This is a religious matter." 
 And finally, out of desperation, I said,,"Well, let me explain Georg Cantor in 1877.",And I started explaining why I was there in Africa,,and they got very excited when they saw the Cantor set.,And one of them said, "Come here. I think I can help you out here.",And so he took me through the initiation ritual for a Bamana priest.,And of course, I was only interested in the math,,so the whole time, he kept shaking his head going,,"You know, I didn't learn it this way.",But I had to sleep with a kola nut next to my bed, buried in sand,,and give seven coins to seven lepers and so on.,And finally, he revealed the truth of the matter.,And it turns out it's a pseudo-random number generator using deterministic chaos.,When you have a four-bit symbol, you then put it together with another one sideways.,So even plus odd gives you odd.,Odd plus even gives you odd.,Even plus even gives you even. Odd plus odd gives you even.,It's addition modulo 2, just like in the parity bit check on your computer.,And then you take this symbol, and you put it back in,so it's a self-generating diversity of symbols.,They're truly using a kind of deterministic chaos in doing this.,Now, because it's a binary code,,you can actually implement this in hardware --,what a fantastic teaching tool that should be in African engineering schools. 
 And the most interesting thing I found out about it was historical.,In the 12th century, Hugo of Santalla brought it from Islamic mystics into Spain.,And there it entered into the alchemy community as geomancy:,divination through the earth.,This is a geomantic chart drawn for King Richard II in 1390.,Leibniz, the German mathematician,,talked about geomancy in his dissertation called "De Combinatoria.",And he said, "Well, instead of using one stroke and two strokes,,let's use a one and a zero, and we can count by powers of two.",Right? Ones and zeros, the binary code.,George Boole took Leibniz's binary code and created Boolean algebra,,and John von Neumann took Boolean algebra and created the digital computer.,So all these little PDAs and laptops --,every digital circuit in the world -- started in Africa.,And I know Brian Eno says there's not enough Africa in computers,,but you know, I don't think there's enough African history in Brian Eno.,(Laughter) (Applause) 
 So let me end with just a few words about applications that we've found for this.,And you can go to our website,,the applets are all free; they just run in the browser.,Anybody in the world can use them.,The National Science Foundation's Broadening Participation in Computing program,recently awarded us a grant to make a programmable version of these design tools,,so hopefully in three years, anybody'll be able to go on the Web,and create their own simulations and their own artifacts.,We've focused in the U.S. on African-American students as well as Native American and Latino.,We've found statistically significant improvement with children using this software in a mathematics class,in comparison with a control group that did not have the software.,So it's really very successful teaching children that they have a heritage that's about mathematics,,that it's not just about singing and dancing.,We've started a pilot program in Ghana.,We got a small seed grant, just to see if folks would be willing to work with us on this;,we're very excited about the future possibilities for that. 
 We've also been working in design.,I didn't put his name up here -- my colleague, Kerry, in Kenya, has come up with this great idea,for using fractal structure for postal address in villages that have fractal structure,,because if you try to impose a grid structure postal system on a fractal village,,it doesn't quite fit.,Bernard Tschumi at Columbia University has finished using this in a design for a museum of African art.,David Hughes at Ohio State University has written a primer on Afrocentric architecture,in which he's used some of these fractal structures. 
 And finally, I just wanted to point out that this idea of self-organization,,as we heard earlier, it's in the brain.,It's in the -- it's in Google's search engine.,Actually, the reason that Google was such a success,is because they were the first ones to take advantage of the self-organizing properties of the web.,It's in ecological sustainability.,It's in the developmental power of entrepreneurship,,the ethical power of democracy.,It's also in some bad things.,Self-organization is why the AIDS virus is spreading so fast.,And if you don't think that capitalism, which is self-organizing, can have destructive effects,,you haven't opened your eyes enough.,So we need to think about, as was spoken earlier,,the traditional African methods for doing self-organization.,These are robust algorithms.,These are ways of doing self-organization -- of doing entrepreneurship --,that are gentle, that are egalitarian.,So if we want to find a better way of doing that kind of work,,we need look only no farther than Africa to find these robust self-organizing algorithms.,Thank you.Jambo, bonjour, zdravstvujtye, dayo: these are a few of the languages,that I've spoken little bits of over the course of the last six weeks,,as I've been to 17 countries I think I'm up to, on this crazy tour I've been doing,,checking out various aspects of the project that we're doing.,And I'm going to tell you a little bit about later on.,And visiting some pretty incredible places,,places like Mongolia, Cambodia, New Guinea, South Africa, Tanzania twice --,I was here a month ago. 
 And the opportunity to make a whirlwind tour of the world like that,is utterly amazing, for lots of reasons.,You see some incredible stuff.,And you get to make these spot comparisons,between people all around the globe.,And the thing that you really take away from that,,the kind of surface thing that you take away from it,,is not that we're all one, although I'm going to tell you about that,,but rather how different we are.,There is so much diversity around the globe.,6,000 different languages spoken by six and a half billion people,,all different colors, shapes, sizes.,You walk down the street in any big city, you travel like that,,and you are amazed at the diversity in the human species. 
 How do we explain that diversity?,Well, that's what I'm going to talk about today,,is how we're using the tools of genetics,,population genetics in particular, to tell us how we generated this diversity,,and how long it took.,Now, the problem of human diversity,,like all big scientific questions --,how do you explain something like that --,can be broken down into sub-questions.,And you can ferret away at those little sub-questions. 
 First one is really a question of origins.,Do we all share a common origin, in fact?,And given that we do -- and that's the assumption,everybody, I think, in this room would make -- when was that?,When did we originate as a species?,How long have we been divergent from each other? 
 And the second question is related, but slightly different.,If we do spring from a common source,,how did we come to occupy every corner of the globe,,and in the process generate all of this diversity,,the different ways of life, the different appearances,,the different languages around the world? 
 Well, the question of origins, as with so many other questions in biology,,seems to have been answered by Darwin over a century ago.,In "The Descent of Man," he wrote,,"In each great region of the world, the living mammals,are closely related to the extinct species of the same region.,It's therefore probable that Africa was formerly inhabited by extinct apes,closely allied to the gorilla and chimpanzee,,and as these two species are now man's nearest allies,,it's somewhat more probable that our early progenitors,lived on the African continent than elsewhere." 
 So we're done, we can go home -- finished the origin question.,Well, not quite. Because Darwin was talking about our distant ancestry,,our common ancestry with apes.,And it is quite clear that apes originated on the African continent.,Around 23 million years ago, they appear in the fossil record.,Africa was actually disconnected from the other landmasses at that time,,due to the vagaries of plate tectonics, floating around the Indian Ocean.,Bumped into Eurasia around 16 million years ago,,and then we had the first African exodus, as we call it.,The apes that left at that time ended up in Southeast Asia,,became the gibbons and the orangutans.,And the ones that stayed on in Africa,evolved into the gorillas, the chimpanzees and us.,So, yes, if you're talking about our common ancestry with apes,,it's very clear, by looking at the fossil record, we started off here. 
 But that's not really the question I'm asking.,I'm asking about our human ancestry,,things that we would recognize as being like us,if they were sitting here in the room.,If they were peering over your shoulder,,you wouldn't leap back, like that. What about our human ancestry?,Because if we go far enough back,,we share a common ancestry with every living thing on Earth.,DNA ties us all together, so we share ancestry with barracuda,and bacteria and mushrooms, if you go far enough back -- over a billion years.,What we're asking about though is human ancestry.,How do we study that? 
 Well, historically, it has been studied using the science of paleoanthropology.,Digging things up out of the ground,,and largely on the basis of morphology --,the way things are shaped, often skull shape -- saying,,"This looks a little bit more like us than that, so this must be my ancestor.,This must be who I'm directly descended from." 
 The field of paleoanthropology, I'll argue,,gives us lots of fascinating possibilities about our ancestry,,but it doesn't give us the probabilities that we really want as scientists.,What do I mean by that?,You're looking at a great example here.,These are three extinct species of hominids,,potential human ancestors.,All dug up just west of here in Olduvai Gorge, by the Leakey family.,And they're all dating to roughly the same time.,From left to right, we've got Homo erectus, Homo habilis,,and Australopithecus -- now called Paranthropus boisei,,the robust australopithecine. Three extinct species, same place, same time.,That means that not all three could be my direct ancestor.,Which one of these guys am I actually related to?,Possibilities about our ancestry, but not the probabilities that we're really looking for. 
 Well, a different approach has been to look at morphology in humans,using the only data that people really had at hand until quite recently --,again, largely skull shape.,The first person to do this systematically was Linnaeus,,Carl von Linne, a Swedish botanist,,who in the eighteenth century took it upon himself,to categorize every living organism on the planet.,You think you've got a tough job?,And he did a pretty good job.,He categorized about 12,000 species in "Systema Naturae.",He actually coined the term Homo sapiens -- it means wise man in Latin.,But looking around the world at the diversity of humans, he said,,"Well, you know, we seem to come in discreet sub-species or categories.",And he talked about Africans and Americans and Asians and Europeans,,and a blatantly racist category he termed "Monstrosus,",which basically included all the people he didn't like,,including imaginary folk like elves. 
 It's easy to dismiss this as the perhaps well-intentioned,but ultimately benighted musings of an eighteenth century scientist,working in the pre-Darwinian era.,Except, if you had taken physical anthropology,as recently as 20 or 30 years ago, in many cases you would have learned,basically that same classification of humanity.,Human races that according to physical anthropologists of 30, 40 years ago --,Carlton Coon is the best example --,had been diverging from each other -- this was in the post-Darwinian era --,for over a million years, since the time of Homo erectus.,But based on what data?,Very little. Very little. Morphology and a lot of guesswork. 
 Well, what I'm going to talk about today,,what I'm going to talk about now is a new approach to this problem.,Instead of going out and guessing about our ancestry,,digging things up out of the ground, possible ancestors,,and saying it on the basis of morphology --,which we still don't completely understand,,we don't know the genetic causes underlying this morphological variation -- 
 what we need to do is turn the problem on its head.,Because what we're really asking is a genealogical problem,,or a genealogical question.,What we're trying to do is construct a family tree for everybody alive today.,And as any genealogist will tell you --,anybody have a member of the family, or maybe you,have tried to construct a family tree, trace back in time?,You start in the present, with relationships you're certain about.,You and your siblings, you have a parent in common.,You and your cousins share a grandparent in common.,You gradually trace further and further back into the past,,adding these ever more distant relationships.,But eventually, no matter how good you are at digging up the church records,,and all that stuff, you hit what the genealogists call a brick wall.,A point beyond which you don't know anything else about your ancestors,,and you enter this dark and mysterious realm we call history,that we have to feel our way through with whispered guidance. 
 Who were these people who came before?,We have no written record. Well, actually, we do.,Written in our DNA, in our genetic code --,we have a historical document that takes us back in time,to the very earliest days of our species. And that's what we study. 
 Now, a quick primer on DNA.,I suspect that not everybody in the audience is a geneticist.,It is a very long, linear molecule, a coded version,of how to make another copy of you. It's your blueprint.,It's composed of four subunits: A, C, G and T, we call them.,And it's the sequence of those subunits that defines that blueprint.,How long is it? Well, it's billions of these subunits in length.,A haploid genome -- we actually have two copies of all of our chromosomes --,a haploid genome is around 3.2 billion nucleotides in length.,And the whole thing, if you add it all together,,is over six billion nucleotides long.,If you take all the DNA out of one cell in your body,,and stretch it end to end, it's around two meters long.,If you take all the DNA out of every cell in your body,,and you stretch it end to end, it would reach from here to the moon and back,,thousands of times. It's a lot of information. 
 And so when you're copying this DNA molecule to pass it on, it's a pretty tough job.,Imagine the longest book you can think of, "War and Peace.",Now multiply it by 100.,And imagine copying that by hand.,And you're working away until late at night,,and you're very, very careful, and you're drinking coffee,and you're paying attention, but, occasionally,,when you're copying this by hand,,you're going to make a little typo, a spelling mistake --,substitute an I for an E, or a C for a T. 
 Same thing happens to our DNA as it's being passed on through the generations.,It doesn't happen very often. We have a proofreading mechanism built in.,But when it does happen, and these changes get transmitted down,through the generations, they become markers of descent.,If you share a marker with someone,,it means you share an ancestor at some point in the past,,the person who first had that change in their DNA.,And it's by looking at the pattern of genetic variation,,the pattern of these markers in people all over the world,,and assessing the relative ages when they occurred throughout our history,,that we've been able to construct a family tree for everybody alive today. 
 These are two pieces of DNA that we use quite widely in our work.,Mitochondrial DNA, tracing a purely maternal line of descent.,You get your mtDNA from your mother, and your mother's mother,,all the way back to the very first woman.,The Y chromosome, the piece of DNA that makes men men,,traces a purely paternal line of descent.,Everybody in this room, everybody in the world,,falls into a lineage somewhere on these trees.,Now, even though these are simplified versions of the real trees,,they're still kind of complicated, so let's simplify them.,Turn them on their sides, combine them so that they look like a tree,with the root at the bottom and the branches going up.,What's the take-home message? 
 Well, the thing that jumps out at you first,is that the deepest lineages in our family trees,are found within Africa, among Africans.,That means that Africans have been accumulating,this mutational diversity for longer.,And what that means is that we originated in Africa. It's written in our DNA.,Every piece of DNA we look at has greater diversity within Africa than outside of Africa.,And at some point in the past, a sub-group of Africans,left the African continent to go out and populate the rest of the world. 
 Now, how recently do we share this ancestry?,Was it millions of years ago, which we might suspect,by looking at all this incredible variation around the world?,No, the DNA tells a story that's very clear.,Within the last 200,000 years, we all share an ancestor, a single person --,Mitochondrial Eve, you might have heard about her -- in Africa,,an African woman who gave rise to all the mitochondrial diversity in the world today. 
 But what's even more amazing,is that if you look at the Y-chromosome side,,the male side of the story, the Y-chromosome Adam,only lived around 60,000 years ago.,That's only about 2,000 human generations,,the blink of an eye in an evolutionary sense.,That tells us we were all still living in Africa at that time.,This was an African man who gave rise,to all the Y chromosome diversity around the world.,It's only within the last 60,000 years,that we have started to generate this incredible diversity we see around the world.,Such an amazing story.,We're all effectively part of an extended African family. 
 Now, that seems so recent. Why didn't we start to leave earlier?,Why didn't Homo erectus evolve into separate species,,or sub-species rather, human races around the world?,Why was it that we seem to have come out of Africa so recently?,Well, that's a big question. These "why" questions,,particularly in genetics and the study of history in general, are always the big ones,,the ones that are tough to answer. 
 And so when all else fails, talk about the weather.,What was going on to the world's weather around 60,000 years ago?,Well, we were going into the worst part of the last ice age.,The last ice age started roughly 120,000 years ago.,It went up and down, and it really started to accelerate around 70,000 years ago.,Lots of evidence from sediment cores,and the pollen types, oxygen isotopes and so on.,We hit the last glacial maximum around 16,000 years ago,,but basically, from 70,000 years on, things were getting really tough,,getting very cold. The Northern Hemisphere had massive growing ice sheets.,New York City, Chicago, Seattle, all under a sheet of ice.,Most of Britain, all of Scandinavia, covered by ice several kilometers thick. 
 Now, Africa is the most tropical continent on the planet --,about 85 percent of it lies between Cancer and Capricorn --,and there aren't a lot of glaciers here,,except on the high mountains here in East Africa.,So what was going on here? We weren't covered in ice in Africa.,Rather, Africa was drying out at that time.,This is a paleo-climatological map,of what Africa looked like between 60,000 and 70,000 years ago,,reconstructed from all these pieces of evidence that I mentioned before.,The reason for that is that ice actually sucks moisture out of the atmosphere.,If you think about Antarctica, it's technically a desert, it gets so little precipitation. 
 So the whole world was drying out.,The sea levels were dropping. And Africa was turning to desert.,The Sahara was much bigger then than it is now.,And the human habitat was reduced to just a few small pockets,,compared to what we have today.,The evidence from genetic data,is that the human population around this time, roughly 70,000 years ago,,crashed to fewer than 2,000 individuals.,We nearly went extinct. We were hanging on by our fingernails. 
 And then something happened. A great illustration of it.,Look at some stone tools.,The ones on the left are from Africa, from around a million years ago.,The ones on the right were made by Neanderthals, our distant cousins,,not our direct ancestors, living in Europe,,and they date from around 50,000 or 60,000 years ago.,Now, at the risk of offending any paleoanthropologists,or physical anthropologists in the audience,,basically there's not a lot of change between these two stone tool groups.,The ones on the left are pretty similar to the ones on the right.,We are in a period of long cultural stasis from a million years ago,until around 60,000 to 70,000 years ago.,The tool styles don't change that much.,The evidence is that the human way of life,didn't change that much during that period. 
 But then 50, 60, 70 thousand years ago, somewhere in that region,,all hell breaks loose. Art makes its appearance.,The stone tools become much more finely crafted.,The evidence is that humans begin to specialize in particular prey species,,at particular times of the year.,The population size started to expand.,Probably, according to what many linguists believe,,fully modern language, syntactic language -- subject, verb, object --,that we use to convey complex ideas, like I'm doing now, appeared around that time.,We became much more social. The social networks expanded. 
 This change in behavior allowed us to survive these worsening conditions in Africa,,and they allowed us to start to expand around the world.,We've been talking at this conference about African success stories.,Well, you want the ultimate African success story?,Look in the mirror. You're it. The reason you're alive today,is because of those changes in our brains that took place in Africa --,probably somewhere in the region where we're sitting right now,,around 60, 70 thousand years ago --,allowing us not only to survive in Africa, but to expand out of Africa.,An early coastal migration along the south coast of Asia,,leaving Africa around 60,000 years ago,,reaching Australia very rapidly, by 50,000 years ago.,A slightly later migration up into the Middle East.,These would have been savannah hunters. 
 So those of you who are going on one of the post-conference tours,,you'll get to see what a real savannah is like.,And it's basically a meat locker.,People who would have specialized in killing the animals,,hunting the animals on those meat locker savannahs, moving up,,following the grasslands into the Middle East around 45,000 years ago,,during one of the rare wet phases in the Sahara.,Migrating eastward, following the grasslands,,because that's what they were adapted to live on. 
 And when they reached Central Asia,,they reached what was effectively a steppe super-highway,,a grassland super-highway.,The grasslands at that time -- this was during the last ice age --,stretched basically from Germany all the way over to Korea,,and the entire continent was open to them.,Entering Europe around 35,000 years ago,,and finally, a small group migrating up,through the worst weather imaginable, Siberia,,inside the Arctic Circle, during the last ice age --,temperature was at -70, -80, even -100, perhaps --,migrating into the Americas, ultimately reaching that final frontier. 
 An amazing story, and it happened first in Africa.,The changes that allowed us to do that,,the evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with us,,allowing us to create novel cultures,,allowing us to develop the diversity,that we see on a whirlwind trip like the one I've just been on. 
 Now, that story I just told you is literally a whirlwind tour,of how we populated the world, the great Paleolithic wanderings of our species.,And that's the story that I told a couple of years ago,in my book, "The Journey of Man," and a film that we made with the same title.,And as we were finishing up that film --,it was co-produced with National Geographic --,I started talking to the folks at NG about this work.,And they got really excited about it. They liked the film, but they said,,"You know, we really see this as kind of,the next wave in the study of human origins, where we all came from,,using the tools of DNA to map the migrations around the world.,You know, the study of human origins is kind of in our DNA,,and we want to take it to the next level.,What do you want to do next?",Which is a great question to be asked by National Geographic. 
 And I said, "Well, you know, what I've sketched out here is just that.,It is a very coarse sketch of how we migrated around the planet.,And it's based on a few thousand people we've sampled from,,you know, a handful of populations around the world.,Studied a few genetic markers, and there are lots of gaps on this map.,We've just connected the dots. What we need to do,is increase our sample size by an order of magnitude or more --,hundreds of thousands of DNA samples from people all over the world." 
 And that was the genesis of the Genographic Project.,The project launched in April 2005.,It has three core components. Obviously, science is a big part of it.,The field research that we're doing around the world with indigenous peoples.,People who have lived in the same location for a long period of time,retain a connection to the place where they live,that many of the rest of us have lost.,So my ancestors come from all over northern Europe.,I live in the Eastern Seaboard of North America when I'm not traveling.,Where am I indigenous to? Nowhere really. My genes are all jumbled up.,But there are people who retain that link to their ancestors,that allows us to contextualize the DNA results. 
 That's the focus of the field research,,the centers that we've set up all over the world --,10 of them, top population geneticists.,But, in addition, we wanted to open up this study to anybody around the world.,How often do you get to participate in a big scientific project?,The Human Genome Project, or a Mars Rover mission. 
 In this case, you actually can.,You can go onto our website, Nationalgeographic.com/genographic.,You can order a kit. You can test your own DNA.,And you can actually submit those results to the database,,and tell us a little about your genealogical background,,have the data analyzed as part of the scientific effort. 
 Now, this is all a nonprofit enterprise, and so the money that we raise,,after we cover the cost of doing the testing and making the kit components,,gets plowed back into the project.,The majority going to something we call the Legacy Fund.,It's a charitable entity, basically a grant-giving entity,that gives money back to indigenous groups around the world,for educational, cultural projects initiated by them.,They apply to this fund in order to do various projects,,and I'll show you a couple of examples. 
 So how are we doing on the project? We've got about 25,000 samples,collected from indigenous people around the world.,The most amazing thing has been the interest on the part of the public;,210,000 people have ordered these participation kits,since we launched two years ago,,which has raised around five million dollars,,the majority of which, at least half, is going back into the Legacy Fund. 
 We've just awarded the first Legacy Grants totaling around 500,000 dollars.,Projects around the world -- documenting oral poetry in Sierra Leone,,preserving traditional weaving patterns in Gaza,,language revitalization in Tajikistan, etc., etc.,So the project is going very, very well,,and I urge you to check out the website and watch this space. 
 Thank you very much.,(Applause)It's very, very difficult,to speak at the end of a conference like this,,because everyone has spoken. Everything has been said.,So I thought that what may be useful is to remind us,of some of the things that have gone on here,,and then maybe offer some ideas which we can take away,,and take forward and work on.,That's what I'd like to try and do.,We came here saying we want to talk about "Africa: the Next Chapter.",But we are talking about "Africa: the Next Chapter",because we are looking at the old and the present chapter -- that we're looking at,,and saying it's not such a good thing.,The picture I showed you before, and this picture, of drought, death and disease,is what we usually see.,What we want to look at is "Africa: the Next Chapter,",and that's this: a healthy, smiling, beautiful African.,And I think it's worth remembering what we've heard,through the conference right from the first day,,where I heard that all the important statistics have been given --,about where we are now,,about how the continent is doing much better.,And the importance of that is that we have a platform to build on. 
 So I'm not going to spend too much time --,just to show you, refresh your memories,that we are here for "Africa: the Next Chapter" because for the first time,there really is a platform to build on.,We really do have it going right,that the continent is growing at rates that people had thought would not happen.,After decades of 2 percent, we are now at 5 percent,,and it's going to -- projected -- 6 and 7 percent even.,And inflation has come down.,External debt -- something that I can tell you a long story about,because I personally worked on one of the biggest debts on the continent --,has come down dramatically.,You know, as you can see,,from almost 50 billion down to about 12 or 13 billion.,Now this is a huge achievement. 
 You know, we've built up reserves. Why is that important?,It's because it shows off our economies, shows off our currencies,and gives a platform on which people can plan and build, including businesses.,We've also seen some evidence that all this is making a difference,because private investment flows have increased.,I want to remind you again --,I know you saw these statistics before --,from almost 6 billion we are now at about 18 billion.,In 2005, remittances -- I just took one country, Nigeria,skyrocketing -- skyrocketing is too dramatic,,but increasing dramatically.,And in many other countries this is happening.,Why is this important? Because it shows confidence.,People are now confident to bring --,if your people in the diaspora bring their money back,,it shows other people that, look,,there is emerging confidence in your country.,And instead of an outflow, you are now getting a net inflow. 
 Now, why is all this important, to have to go really fast?,It's important that we build this platform,,that we have the president, Kikwete, and others of our leaders who are saying,,"Look, we must do something different.",Because we are confronted with a challenge.,62 percent of our population is below the age of 24.,What does this mean?,This means that we have to focus on how our youth,are going to be engaged in productive endeavor in their lives.,You have to focus on how to create jobs,,make sure they don't fall into disease, and that they get an education.,But most of all that they are productively engaged in life,,and that they are creating the kind of productive environment,in our countries that will make things happen.,And to support this, I just recently --,one of the things I've done since leaving government,is to start an opinion research organization in Nigeria.,Most of our countries don't even have any opinion research.,People don't have voice.,There is no way you can know what people want. 
 One of the things we asked them recently was what's their top issue.,Like in every other country where this has been done,,jobs is the top issue.,I want to leave this up here and come back to it.,But before I get to this slide, I just wanted to run you through this.,And to say that for me, the next stage of building this platform,that now enables us to move forward --,and we mustn't make light of it.,It was only 5, 6, 7 years ago,we couldn't even talk about the next chapter, because we were in the old chapter.,We were going nowhere.,The economies were not growing.,We were having negative per capita growth.,The microeconomic framework and foundation for moving forward,was not even there.,So let's not forget that it's taken a lot to build this,,including all those things that we tried to do in Nigeria that Dele referred to.,Creating our own program to solve problems, like fighting corruption,,building institutions, stabilizing the micro economy. 
 So now we have this platform we can build on.,And it brings us to the debate that has been going on here:,aid versus private sector, aid versus trade, etc.,And someone stood up to say that one of the frustrating things,is that it's been a simplistic debate.,And that's not what the debate should be about.,That's engaging in the wrong debate.,The issue here is how do we get a partnership that involves government donors,,the private sector and ordinary African people,taking charge of their own lives?,How do we combine all this?,To move our continent forward, to do the things that need doing,that I talked about -- getting young people employed.,Getting the creative juices flowing on this continent,,much of what you have seen here.,So I'm afraid we've been engaging a little bit in the wrong debate.,We need to bring it back to say,,what is the combination of all these factors,that is going to yield what we want? (Applause) 
 And I want to tell you something.,For me, the issue about aid --,I don't think that Africans need to now go all the way over to the other side,and feel bad about aid.,Africa has been giving the other countries aid.,Mo Ibrahim said at a debate we were at that,he dreams one day when Africa will be giving aid.,And I said, "Mo, you're right. We have -- no, but we've already been doing it!,The U.K. and the U.S. could not have been built today without Africa's aid." 
 (Applause) 
 It is all the resources that were taken from Africa,,including human, that built these countries today!,So when they try to give back, we shouldn't be on the defensive.,The issue is not that.,The issue is how are we using what has been given back.,How are we using it?,Is it being directed effectively?,I want to tell you a little story.,Why I don't mind if we get aid, but we use it well.,From 1967 to '70, Nigeria fought a war -- the Nigeria-Biafra war.,And in the middle of that war, I was 14 years old.,We spent much of our time with my mother cooking.,For the army -- my father joined the army as a brigadier -- the Biafran army.,We were on the Biafran side.,And we were down to eating one meal a day, running from place to place,,but wherever we could help we did.,At a certain point in time, in 1969, things were really bad.,We were down to almost nothing in terms of a meal a day.,People, children were dying of kwashiorkor.,I'm sure some of you who are not so young,will remember those pictures.,Well, I was in the middle of it. 
 In the midst of all this, my mother fell ill with a stomach ailment for two or three days.,We thought she was going to die.,My father was not there.,He was in the army.,So I was the oldest person in the house.,My sister fell very ill with malaria.,She was three years old and I was 15.,And she had such a high fever. We tried everything.,It didn't look like it was going to work.,Until we heard that 10 kilometers away there was a doctor, who was,looking at people and giving them meds.,Now I put my sister on my back -- burning --,and I walked 10 kilometers with her strapped on my back.,It was really hot. I was very hungry.,I was scared because I knew her life depended on my getting to this woman.,We heard there was a woman doctor who was treating people.,I walked 10 kilometers, putting one foot in front of the other.,I got there and I saw huge crowds.,Almost a thousand people were there, trying to break down the door.,She was doing this in a church. How was I going to get in? 
 I had to crawl in between the legs of these people,with my sister strapped on my back,,find a way to a window.,And while they were trying to break down the door,,I climbed in through the window, and jumped in.,This woman told me it was in the nick of time.,By the time we jumped into that hall, she was barely moving.,She gave a shot of her chloroquine -- what I learned was the chloroquine then --,gave her some -- it must have been a re-hydration --,and some other therapies, and put us in a corner.,In about two to three hours, she started to move.,And then they toweled her down because she started sweating,,which was a good sign.,And then my sister woke up.,And about five or six hours later, she said we could go home.,I strapped her on my back.,I walked the 10 kilometers back and it was the shortest walk I ever had.,I was so happy -- (Applause) -- that my sister was alive!,Today she's 41 years old, a mother of three,,and she's a physician saving other lives. 
 Why am I telling that? I'm telling you that because --,when it is you or your person involved --,you don't care where -- whether it's aid.,You don't care what it is! (Applause),You just want the person to be alive!,And now let me become less sentimental, and say that saving lives --,which some of the aid we get does on this continent --,when you save the life of anyone, a farmer, a teacher, a mother,,they are contributing productively into the economy.,And as an economist, we can also look at that side of the story.,These are people who are productive agents in the economy.,So if we save people from HIV/AIDS, if we save them from malaria,,it means they can form the base of production for our economy.,And by the same token --,as someone said yesterday -- if we don't and they die,,their children will become a burden on the economy.,So even from an economic standpoint,,if we leave the social and the humanitarian,,we need to save lives now.,So that's one of the reasons, from a personal experience, that I say,let's channel these resources we get into something productive.,However, I will also tell you that I'm one of those,who doesn't believe that this is the sole answer.,That's why I said the debate has to get more sophisticated.,You know, we have to use it well. 
 What has happened in Europe?,Do you all know that Spain -- part of the EU --,got 10 billion dollars in aid from the rest of the EU?,Resources that were transferred to them --,and were the Spanish ashamed of this? No!,The EU transferred 10 billion. Where did they use it?,Have you been to southern Spain lately? There are roads everywhere.,Infrastructure everywhere.,It is on the back of this that the whole of southern Spain,has developed into a services economy.,Did you know that Ireland got 3 billion dollars in aid?,Ireland is one of the fastest-growing economies in the European Union today.,For which many people, even from other parts of the world,,are going there to find jobs.,What did they do with the 3 billion dollars in aid?,They used it to build an information superhighway,,gain infrastructure that,enables them to participate in the,information technology revolution,,and to create jobs in their economy.,They didn't say, "No, you know, we're not going to take this.",Today, the European Union is busy transferring aid.,My frustration is if they can build infrastructure in Spain --,which is roads, highways, other things that they can build --,I say then, why do they refuse to use the same aid,to build the same infrastructure in our countries? (Applause) 
 When we ask them and tell them what we need,,one of my worries today is that we have many foundations now.,Now we talk about the World Bank, IMF, and accountability, all that,and the EU.,We also have private citizens now who have a lot of money --,some of them in this audience, with private foundations.,And one day, these foundations have so much money,,they will overtake the official aid that is being given.,But I fear -- and I'm very grateful to all of them,for what they are trying to do on the continent --,but I'm also worried. I wake up with a gnawing in my belly,because I see a new set of aid entrepreneurs on the continent.,And they're also going from country to country,,and many times trying to find what to do.,But I'm not really sure that their assistance,is also being channeled in the right way.,And many of them are not really familiar with the continent.,They are just discovering.,And many times I don't see Africans working with them.,They are just going alone! (Applause) 
 And many times I get the impression that they are not really even interested,in hearing from Africans who might know.,They want to visit us,,see what's happening on the ground and make a decision.,And now I'm maybe being harsh.,But I worry because this money is so important.,Now, who are they accountable to?,Are we on their boards when they make decisions,about where to channel money? Are we there?,Will we make the same mistake that we made before?,Have our presidents and our leaders -- everyone is talking about --,have they ever called these people together and said,,"Look, your foundation and your foundation --,you have so much money, we are grateful.,Let's sit down and really tell you where the money should be channeled,and where this aid should go.",Have we done that? The answer is no.,And each one is making their own individual effort.,And then 10 years from now, billions will again have gone into Africa,,and we would still have the same problems. 
 This is what gives us the hopeless image.,Our inability to take charge and say to all these people bringing their money,,"Sit down.",And we don't do it because there are so many of us. We don't coordinate.,We've not called the Bill Gates, and the Soros,,and everybody else who is helping and say,,"Sit down. Let's have a conference with you.,As a continent, here are our priorities.,Here is where we want you to channel this money.",Each one should not be an entrepreneur,going out and finding what is best.,We're not trying to stop them at all! But to help them help us better.,And what is disappointing me is that we are not doing this.,Ten years from now we will have the same story,,and we will be repeating the same things.,So our problem right now is, how can we leverage,all this good will that is coming towards our way?,How can we get government to combine properly,with these private foundations, with the international organizations,,and with our private sector. 
 I firmly believe in that private sector thing too.,But it cannot do it alone.,So there might be a few ideas we could think of that could work.,They said this is about proliferating and sharing ideas.,So why don't we think of using some of this aid?,Well, why don't we first say to those helping us out,,"Don't be shy about infrastructure.,That health that you're working on cannot be sustainable without infrastructure.,That education will work better,if we've got electricity and railroads, and so on.,That agriculture will work better if there are railroads to get the goods to market.,Don't be shy of it.,Invest some of your resources in that, too.",And then we can see that this is one combination,of private, international, multilateral money,,private sector and the African that we can put together as a partnership,,so that aid can be a facilitator.,That is all aid can be.,Aid cannot solve our problems, I'm firmly convinced about that.,But it can be catalytic. And if we fail to use it as catalytic,,we would have failed. 
 One of the reasons why China is a bit popular with Africans now --,one of the reasons is not only just that, you know, these people are stupid,and China is coming to take resources.,It's because there's a little more leverage in terms of the Chinese.,If you tell them, "We need a road here,",they will help you build it.,They don't shy away from infrastructure.,In fact, the Chinese minister of finance said to me,,when I asked him what are we doing wrong in Nigeria.,He said, "There are two things you need only.,Infrastructure, infrastructure, infrastructure and discipline.,You are undisciplined." (Applause),And I repeat it for the continent.,It's the same. We need infrastructure, infrastructure and discipline.,So we can make a catalytic to help us provide some of that.,Now I realize -- I'm not saying -- health and education --,no, you can also provide that as well.,But I'm saying it's not either or.,Let's see how aid can be a facilitator in partnership.,One idea.,Second thing, for the private sector,,people are afraid to take risks on the continent.,Why can't some of this aid be used as a kind of guarantee mechanisms,,to enable people to take risk? 
 (Applause) 
 And finally, because they are both standing at my -- I'm out of time.,Am I out of time?,OK, so let me not forget my punchline.,One of the things I want everybody to collaborate on is,to support women, to create jobs. (Applause),A lot has been said here about women, I don't need to repeat it.,But there are people -- women -- creating jobs.,And we know, studies have shown,that when you put resources in the hand of the woman --,in fact, there's an econometric study,,the World Bank Review, done in 2000, showing that,transfers into the hands of women result,in healthier children, more for the household, more for the economy and all that.,So I'm saying that one of the takeaways from here --,I'm not saying the men are not important --,obviously, if you leave the husbands out, what will they do?,They'll come back home and get disgruntled,,and it will result in difficulties we don't want.,We don't want men beating their wives,because they don't have a job, and so on. 
 But at the margin, we also -- I want to push this,,because the reason is the men automatically --,they get -- not automatically, but they tend to get more support.,But I want you to realize that resources,in the hands of African women is a powerful tool.,There are people creating jobs.,Beatrice Gakuba has created 200 jobs from her flower business in Rwanda.,We have Ibukun Awosika in Nigeria, with the chair company.,She wants to expand.,She needs another 20 million.,She will create another 100, 200 more jobs.,So take away from here is how are you going to put together,the resources to put money in the hands of women in the middle,who are ready --,business people who want to expand and create more jobs.,And lastly, what are you going to do,to be part of this partnership of aid, government, private sector,and the African as an individual?,Thank you. (Applause)I’d like to dedicate this one to all the women in South Africa --,those women who refused to dwindle in the midst of apartheid.,And, of course, I’m dedicating it also to my grandmother,,whom I think really played quite a lot of important roles,,especially for me when I was an activist, and being harassed by the police. 
 You will recall that in 1976, June 16, the students of South Africa boycotted,the language of Afrikaans as the medium of the oppressor,,as they were sort of like really told,that they must do everything in Afrikaans --,biology, mathematics -- and what about our languages?,And the students wanted to speak to the government,,and police answered with bullets.,So every year, June 16, we will commemorate,all those comrades or students who died.,And I was very young then. I think I was 11 years,,and I started asking questions,,and that’s when my political education started.,And I joined, later on, the youth organization,under the African National Congress.,So as part of organizing this and whatever,,this commemoration, the police will round us up,as they call us leaders.,And I used to run away from home,,when I know that maybe the police might be coming,around the ninth or 10th of June or so.,And my grandmother one time said,,"No, look, you’re not going to run away.,This is your place, you stay here.",And indeed, the police came -- because they’ll just arrest us,and put us in jail and release us whenever they feel like, after the 20th or so. 
 So it was on the 10th of June, and they came, and they surrounded the house,,and my grandmother switched off all the lights in the house,,and opened the kitchen door.,And she said to them, "Vusi's here, and you're not going to take him tonight.,I'm tired of you having to come here, harassing us,,while your children are sleeping peacefully in your homes.,He is here, and you're not going to take him.,I've got a bowl full of boiling water -- the first one who comes in here, gets it.",And they left.,(Applause) (Music)

 I'm a paleoanthropologist, and my job is to define,man's place in nature and explore what makes us human.,And today, I will use Selam, the earliest child ever discovered,,to tell you a story of all of us.,Selam is our most complete skeleton of a three-year-old girl,who lived and died 3.3 million years ago.,She belongs to the species known as Australopithecus afarensis.,You don't need to remember that.,That's the Lucy species, and was found by my research team,in December of 2000 in an area called Dikika.,It's in the northeastern part of Ethiopia.,And Selam means peace in many Ethiopian languages.,We use that name to celebrate peace in the region and in the planet.,And the fact that it was the cover story of all these famous magazines,gives you already an idea of her significance, I think. 
 After I was invited by TED, I did some digging,,because that's what we do, to know about my host.,You don't just jump into an invitation.,And I learned that the first technology appeared,in the form of stone tools, 2.6 million years ago.,First entertainment comes evidence from flutes that are 35,000 years old.,And evidence for first design comes 75,000 years old -- beads.,And you can do the same with your genes and track them back in time.,And DNA analysis of living humans and chimpanzees,teaches us today that we diverged sometime around seven million years ago,and that these two species share over 98 percent of the same genetic material.,I think knowing this is a very useful context,within which we can think of our ancestry. 
 However, DNA analysis informs us only about,the beginning and the end, telling us nothing,about what happened in the middle.,So, for us, paleoanthropologists, our job is to find the hard evidence,,the fossil evidence, to fill in this gap,and see the different stages of development.,Because it's only when you do that, that you can talk about --,(Laughter) --,it's only when you do that, [that] you can talk about,how we looked like and how we behaved at different times,,and how those likes and looks and behaviors changed through time.,That then gives you an access,to explore the biological mechanisms,and forces that are responsible for this gradual change,that made us what we are today.,But finding the hard evidence is a very complicated endeavor.,It's a systematic and scientific approach,,which takes you to places that are remote, hot, hostile and often with no access. 
 Just to give you an example, when I went to Dikika,,where Selam was found, in '99 -- and it's about 500 kilometers,from Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia.,It took us only seven hours to do the first 470 kilometers of the 500,,but took four, solid hours to do the last only 30 kilometers.,With the help of the locals and using just shovels and picks, I made my way.,I was the first person to actually drive a car to the spot.,When you get there, this is what you see,,and it's the vastness of the place which makes you feel helpless and vulnerable.,And once you make it there, the big question is where to start.,(Laughter),And you find nothing for years and years. 
 When I go to places like this, which are paleontological sites,,it's like going to a game park, an extinct game park.,But what you find are not the human remains,,such as Selam and Lucy, on a day-to-day basis.,You find elephants, rhinos, monkeys, pigs, etc.,But you could ask, how could these large mammals,live in this desert environment?,Of course, they cannot, but I'm telling you already,that the environment and the carrying capacity,of this region was drastically different from what we have today.,A very important environmental lesson could be learned from this.,Anyway, once we made it there, then it's a game park, as I said, an extinct game park.,And our ancestors lived in that game park,,but were just the minorities. They were not as successful,and as widespread as the Homo sapiens that we are. 
 To tell you just an example, an anecdote about their rarity,,I was going to this place every year and would do fieldwork here,,and the assistants, of course, helped me do the surveys.,They would find a bone and tell me, "Here is what you're looking for.",I would say, "No, that's an elephant.",Again, another one, "That's a monkey." "That's a pig," etc.,So one of my assistants, who never went to school, said to me, "Listen, Zeray.,You either don't know what you're looking for,,or you're looking in the wrong place," he said.,(Laughter),And I said, "Why?" "Because there were elephants and lions,,and the people were scared and went somewhere else.,Let's go somewhere else.",Well, he was very tired, and it's really tiring. 
 It was then, after such hard work and many frustrating years that we found Selam,,and you see the face here covered by sandstone.,And here is actually the spinal column,and the whole torso encased in a sandstone block,,because she was buried by a river.,What you have here seems to be nothing,,but contains an incredible amount of scientific information,that helps us explore what makes us human.,This is the earliest and most complete juvenile human ancestor,ever found in the history of paleoanthropology,,an amazing piece of our long, long history.,There were these three people and me, and I am taking the pictures,,that's why I am not in. 
 How would you feel if you were me? You have something extraordinary in your hand,,but you are in the middle of nowhere?,The feeling I had was a deep and quiet happiness and excitement,,of course accompanied by a huge sense of responsibility,,of making sure everything is safe. 
 Here is a close-up of the fossil, after five years of cleaning,,preparation and description, which was very long,,as I had to expose the bones from the sandstone block,I just showed you in the previous slide.,It took five years.,In a way, this was like the second birth for the child, after 3.3 million years,,but the labor was very long.,And here is full scale -- it's a tiny bone.,And in the middle is the minister of Ethiopian tourism,,who came to visit the National Museum of Ethiopia while I was working there.,And you see me worried and trying to protect my child,,because you don't leave anyone with this kind of child,,even a minister. 
 So then, once you've done that, the next stage is to know what it is.,(Laughter),Once that was done, then it was possible to compare.,We were able to tell that she belonged,to the human family tree because the legs, the foot,,and some features clearly showed that she walked upright,,and upright walking is a hallmark in humanity.,But in addition, if you compare the skull,with a comparably aged chimpanzee and little George Bush here,,you see that you have vertical forehead.,And you see that in humans, because of the development,of the pre-frontal cortex, it's called.,You don't see that in chimpanzees,,and you don't see this very projecting canine.,So she belongs to our family tree, but within that, of course,,you do detailed analysis, and we know now,that she belongs to the Lucy species,,known as Australopithecus afarensis. 
 The next exciting question is, girl or boy?,And how old was she when she died?,You can determine the sex of the individual,based on the size of the teeth.,How?,You know, in primates, there is this phenomenon,called sexual dimorphism, which simply means,males are larger than females and males have larger teeth,than the females.,But to do that, you need the permanent dentition,,which you don't see here, because what you have here,are the baby teeth.,But using the CT scanning technology,,which is normally used for medical purposes,,you can go deep into the mouth and come up with this beautiful image,showing you both the baby teeth here,and the still-growing adult teeth here.,So when you measure those teeth,,it was clear that she turned out to be a girl,with very small canine teeth.,And to know how old she was when she died, what you do is,you do an informed estimate, and you say, how much time would be required,to form this amount of teeth, and the answer was three.,So, this girl died when she was about three,,3.3 million years ago. 
 So, with all that information, the big question is --,what do we actually -- what does she tell us?,To answer this question, we can phrase another question.,What do we actually know about our ancestors?,We want to know how they looked like, how they behaved,,how they walked around,,and how they lived and grew up.,And among the answers that you can get from this skeleton,are included: first, this skeleton documents,,for the first time, how infants looked over three million years ago. 
 And second, she tells us that she walked upright,,but had some adaptation for tree climbing.,And more interesting, however,,is the brain in this child was still growing.,At age three, if you have a still-growing brain,,it's a human behavior.,In chimps, by age three, the brain is formed over 90 percent.,That's why they can cope with their environment,very easily after birth -- faster than us, anyway.,But in humans, we continue to grow our brains.,That's why we need care from our parents.,But that care means also you learn.,You spend more time with your parents.,And that's very characteristic of humans and it's called childhood,,which is this extended dependence of human children,on their family or parents.,So, the still-growing brain in this individual,tells us that childhood, which requires,an incredible social organization,,a very complex social organization,,emerged over three million years ago. 
 So, by being at the cusp of our evolutionary history,,Selam unites us all and gives us a unique account,on what makes us human.,But not everything was human, and I will give you,a very exciting example.,This is called the hyoid bone. It's a bone which is right here.,It supports your tongue from behind.,It's, in a way, your voice box.,It determines the type of voice you produce.,It was not known in the fossil record,,and we have it in this skeleton.,When we did the analysis of this bone, it was clear,that it looked very chimp-like, chimpanzee-like.,So if you were there 3.3 million years ago,,to hear when this girl was crying out for her mother,,she would have sounded more like a chimpanzee than a human.,Maybe you're wondering, "So, you see this ape feature, human feature, ape feature.,What does that tell us?",You know, that is very exciting for us,,because it demonstrates that things were changing slowly and progressively,,and that evolution is in the making. 
 To summarize the significance of this fossil,,we can say the following.,Up to now, the knowledge that we had about our ancestors,came essentially from adult individuals,because the fossils, the baby fossils, were missing.,They don't preserve well, as you know.,So the knowledge that we had about our ancestors,,on how they looked like, how they behaved,,was kind of biased toward adults.,Imagine somebody coming from Mars,and his job is to report on the type of people,occupying our planet Earth, and you hide all the babies,,the children, and he goes back and reports.,Can you imagine how much biased his report would be?,That's what somehow we were doing so far,in the absence of the fossil children,,so I think the new fossil fixes this problem. 
 So, I think the most important question at the end is,,what do we actually learn from specimens like this,and from our past in general?,Of course, in addition to extracting this huge amount,of scientific information as to what makes us human,,you know, the many human ancestors that have existed,over the past six million years -- and there are more than 10 --,they did not have the knowledge, the technology and sophistications,that we, Homo sapiens, have today.,But if this species, ancient species,,would travel in time and see us today,,they would very much be very proud of their legacy,,because they became the ancestors of,the most successful species in the universe.,And they were probably not aware of this future legacy,,but they did great.,Now the question is, we Homo sapiens today,are in a position to decide about the future of our planet, possibly more.,So the question is, are we up to the challenge?,And can we really do better than these primitive,,small-brained ancestors? 
 Among the most pressing challenges that our species,is faced with today are the chronic problems of Africa.,Needless to list them here, and there are more competent people,to talk about this.,Still, in my opinion, we have two choices.,One is to continue to see a poor, ill, crying Africa,,carrying guns, that depends on other people forever,,or to promote an Africa which is confident,,peaceful, independent, but cognizant of its huge problems,and great values at the same time.,I am for the second option, and I'm sure many of you are.,And the key is to promote a positive African attitude towards Africa. 
 That's because we Africans concentrate --,I am from Ethiopia, by the way --,we concentrate too much on how we are seen,from elsewhere, or from outside.,I think it's important to promote in a more positive way,on how we see ourselves.,That's what I call positive African attitude.,So finally, I would like to say,,so let's help Africa walk upright and forward,,then we all can be proud of our future legacy as a species. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)You've all seen lots of articles on climate change,,and here's yet another New York Times article,,just like every other darn one you've seen.,It says all the same stuff as all the other ones you've seen.,It even has the same amount of headline as all the other ones you've seen.,What's unusual about this one, maybe, is that it's from 1953.,And the reason I'm saying this,is that you may have the idea this problem is relatively recent.,That people have just sort of figured out about it, and now,with Kyoto and the Governator and people beginning to actually do something,,we may be on the road to a solution.,The fact is -- uh-uh.,We've known about this problem for 50 years, depending on how you count it.,We have talked about it endlessly over the last decade or so.,And we've accomplished close to zip. 
 This is the growth rate of CO2 in the atmosphere.,You've seen this in various forms,,but maybe you haven't seen this one.,What this shows is that the rate of growth of our emissions is accelerating.,And that it's accelerating even faster,than what we thought was the worst case just a few years back.,So that red line there was something that a lot of skeptics said,the environmentalists only put in the projections,to make the projections look as bad as possible,,that emissions would never grow as fast as that red line.,But in fact, they're growing faster. 
 Here's some data from actually just 10 days ago,,which shows this year's minimum of the Arctic Sea ice, and it's the lowest by far.,And the rate at which the Arctic Sea ice is going away is a lot quicker than models.,So despite all sorts of experts like me flying around the planet and,burning jet fuel, and politicians signing treaties --,in fact, you could argue the net effect of all this has been negative,,because it's just consumed a lot of jet fuel. (Laughter),No, no! In terms of what we really need to do to put the brakes on,this very high inertial thing -- our big economy -- we've really hardly started.,Really, we're doing this, basically. Really, not very much. 
 I don't want to depress you too much.,The problem is absolutely soluble, and even soluble in a way that's reasonably cheap.,Cheap meaning sort of the cost of the military, not the cost of medical care.,Cheap meaning a few percent of GDP.,No, this is really important to have this sense of scale.,So the problem is soluble, and the way we should go about solving it is, say,,dealing with electricity production,,which causes something like 43-or-so percent and rising of CO2 emissions.,And we could do that by perfectly sensible things like conservation,,and wind power, nuclear power and coal to CO2 capture,,which are all things that are ready for giant scale deployment, and work.,All we lack is the action to actually spend the money to put those into place.,Instead, we spend our time talking. 
 But nevertheless, that's not what I'm going to talk to you about tonight.,What I'm going to talk to you about tonight is stuff we might do if we did nothing.,And it's this stuff in the middle here, which is what you do,if you don't stop the emissions quickly enough.,And you need to deal -- somehow break the link between human actions,that change climate, and the climate change itself. And that's particularly important,because, of course, while we can adapt to climate change --,and it's important to be honest here, there will be some benefits to climate change.,Oh, yes, I think it's bad. I've spent my whole life working to stop it.,But one of the reasons it's politically hard is there are winners and losers -- not all losers.,But, of course, the natural world, polar bears.,I spent time skiing across the sea ice for weeks at a time in the high Arctic.,They will completely lose.,And there's no adaption. 
 So this problem is absolutely soluble.,This geo-engineering idea, in it's simplest form, is basically the following.,You could put signed particles, say sulfuric acid particles -- sulfates --,into the upper atmosphere, the stratosphere,,where they'd reflect away sunlight and cool the planet.,And I know for certain that that will work.,Not that there aren't side effects, but I know for certain it will work.,And the reason is, it's been done.,And it was done not by us, not by me, but by nature. 
 Here's Mount Pinatubo in the early '90s. That put a whole bunch of sulfur,in the stratosphere with a sort of atomic bomb-like cloud.,The result of that was pretty dramatic.,After that, and some previous volcanoes we have, you see,a quite dramatic cooling of the atmosphere.,So this lower bar is the upper atmosphere, the stratosphere,,and it heats up after these volcanoes.,But you'll notice that in the upper bar, which is the lower atmosphere,and the surface, it cools down because we shielded the atmosphere a little bit.,There's no big mystery about it.,There's lots of mystery in the details, and there's some bad side effects,,like it partially destroys the ozone layer -- and I'll get to that in a minute.,But it clearly cools down.,And one other thing: it's fast.,It's really important to say. So much of the other things that we ought to do,,like slowing emissions, are intrinsically slow, because it takes time,to build all the hardware we need to reduce emissions.,And not only that, when you cut emissions, you don't cut concentrations,,because concentrations, the amount of CO2 in the air,,is the sum of emissions over time.,So you can't step on the brakes very quickly.,But if you do this, it's quick.,And there are times you might like to do something quick. 
 Another thing you might wonder about is, does it work?,Can you shade some sunlight and effectively compensate for the added CO2,,and produce a climate sort of back to what it was originally?,And the answer seems to be yes.,So here are the graphs you've seen lots of times before.,That's what the world looks like, under one particular climate model's view,,with twice the amount of CO2 in the air.,The lower graph is with twice the amount of CO2 and 1.8 percent less sunlight,,and you're back to the original climate.,And this graph from Ken Caldeira. It's important to say came, because,Ken -- at a meeting that I believe Marty Hoffart was also at in the mid-'90s --,Ken and I stood up at the back of the meeting and said,,"Geo-engineering won't work.",And to the person who was promoting it said,,"The atmosphere's much more complicated.",Gave a bunch of physical reasons why it wouldn't do a very good compensation.,Ken went and ran his models, and found that it did. 
 This topic is also old.,That report that landed on President Johnson's desk when I was two years old --,1965.,That report, in fact, which had all the modern climate science --,the only thing they talked about doing was geo-engineering.,It didn't even talk about cutting emissions,,which is an incredible shift in our thinking about this problem.,I'm not saying we shouldn't cut emissions.,We should, but it made exactly this point.,So, in a sense, there's not much new.,The one new thing is this essay.,So I should say, I guess, that since the time of that original President Johnson report,,and the various reports of the U.S. National Academy --,1977, 1982, 1990 -- people always talked about this idea.,Not as something that was foolproof, but as an idea to think about. 
 But when climate became, politically, a hot topic -- if I may make the pun --,in the last 15 years, this became so un-PC, we couldn't talk about it.,It just sunk below the surface. We weren't allowed to speak about it.,But in the last year, Paul Crutzen published this essay,saying roughly what's all been said before: that maybe, given our very slow rate,of progress in solving this problem and the uncertain impacts,,we should think about things like this.,He said roughly what's been said before.,The big deal was he happened to have won the Nobel prize for ozone chemistry.,And so people took him seriously when he said we should think about this,,even though there will be some ozone impacts.,And in fact, he had some ideas to make them go away. 
 There was all sorts of press coverage, all over the world,,going right down to "Dr. Strangelove Saves the Earth," from the Economist.,And that got me thinking. I've worked on this topic on and off,,but not so much technically. And I was actually lying in bed thinking one night.,And I thought about this child's toy -- hence, the title of my talk --,and I wondered if you could use the same physics that makes that thing spin 'round,in the child's radiometer, to levitate particles into the upper atmosphere,and make them stay there.,One of the problems with sulfates is they fall out quickly.,The other problem is they're right in the ozone layer,,and I'd prefer them above the ozone layer.,And it turns out, I woke up the next morning, and I started to calculate this.,It was very hard to calculate from first principles. I was stumped.,But then I found out that there were all sorts of papers already published,that addressed this topic because it happens already in the natural atmosphere.,So it seems there are already fine particles,that are levitated up to what we call the mesosphere, about 100 kilometers up,,that already have this effect. 
 I'll tell you very quickly how the effect works.,There are a lot of fun complexities,that I'd love to spend the whole evening on, but I won't.,But let's say you have sunlight hitting some particle and it's unevenly heated.,So the side facing the sun is warmer; the side away, cooler.,Gas molecules that bounce off the warm side,bounce away with some extra velocity because it's warm.,And so you see a net force away from the sun.,That's called the photophoretic force.,There are a bunch of other versions of it that I and some collaborators,have thought about how to exploit.,And of course, we may be wrong --,this hasn't all been peer reviewed, we're in the middle of thinking about it --,but so far, it seems good.,But it looks like we could achieve long atmospheric lifetimes --,much longer than before -- because they're levitated.,We can move things out of the stratosphere into the mesosphere,,in principle solving the ozone problem.,I'm sure there will be other problems that arise.,Finally, we could make the particles migrate to over the poles,,so we could arrange the climate engineering so it really focused on the poles.,Which would have minimal bad impacts in the middle of the planet,,where we live, and do the maximum job of what we might need to do,,which is cooling the poles in case of planetary emergency, if you like. 
 This is a new idea that's crept up that may be, essentially,,a cleverer idea than putting sulfates in.,Whether this idea is right or some other idea is right,,I think it's almost certain we will,eventually think of cleverer things to do than just putting sulfur in.,That if engineers and scientists really turned their minds to this,,it's amazing how we can affect the planet.,The one thing about this is it gives us extraordinary leverage.,This improved science and engineering will, whether we like it or not,,give us more and more leverage to affect the planet,,to control the planet,,to give us weather and climate control -- not because we plan it,,not because we want it, just because science delivers it to us bit by bit,,with better knowledge of the way the system works,and better engineering tools to effect it. 
 Now, suppose that space aliens arrived.,Maybe they're going to land at the U.N. headquarters down the road here,,or maybe they'll pick a smarter spot --,but suppose they arrive and they give you a box.,And the box has two knobs.,One knob is the knob for controlling global temperature.,Maybe another knob is a knob for controlling CO2 concentrations.,You might imagine that we would fight wars over that box.,Because we have no way to agree about where to set the knobs.,We have no global governance.,And different people will have different places they want it set.,Now, I don't think that's going to happen. It's not very likely. 
 But we're building that box.,The scientists and engineers of the world,are building it piece by piece, in their labs.,Even when they're doing it for other reasons.,Even when they're thinking they're just working on protecting the environment.,They have no interest in crazy ideas like engineering the whole planet.,They develop science that makes it easier and easier to do.,And so I guess my view on this is not that I want to do it -- I do not --,but that we should move this out of the shadows and talk about it seriously.,Because sooner or later, we'll be confronted with decisions about this,,and it's better if we think hard about it,,even if we want to think hard about reasons why we should never do it. 
 I'll give you two different ways to think about this problem that are the beginning,of my thinking about how to think about it.,But what we need is not just a few oddballs like me thinking about this.,We need a broader debate.,A debate that involves musicians, scientists, philosophers, writers,,who get engaged with this question about climate engineering,and think seriously about what its implications are.,So here's one way to think about it,,which is that we just do this instead of cutting emissions because it's cheaper.,I guess the thing I haven't said about this is, it is absurdly cheap.,It's conceivable that, say, using the sulfates method or this method I've come up with,,you could create an ice age at a cost of .001 percent of GDP.,It's very cheap. We have a lot of leverage.,It's not a good idea, but it's just important. (Laughter),I'll tell you how big the lever is: the lever is that big.,And that calculation isn't much in dispute.,You might argue about the sanity of it, but the leverage is real. (Laughter) 
 So because of this, we could deal with the problem,simply by stopping reducing emissions,,and just as the concentrations go up, we can increase,the amount of geo-engineering.,I don't think anybody takes that seriously.,Because under this scenario, we walk further and further away,from the current climate.,We have all sorts of other problems, like ocean acidification,that come from CO2 in the atmosphere, anyway.,Nobody but maybe one or two very odd folks really suggest this. 
 But here's a case which is harder to reject.,Let's say that we don't do geo-engineering, we do what we ought to do,,which is get serious about cutting emissions.,But we don't really know how quickly we have to cut them.,There's a lot of uncertainty about exactly how much climate change is too much.,So let's say that we work hard, and we actually don't just tap the brakes,,but we step hard on the brakes and really reduce emissions,and eventually reduce concentrations.,And maybe someday -- like 2075, October 23 --,we finally reach that glorious day where concentrations have peaked,and are rolling down the other side.,And we have global celebrations, and we've actually started to -- you know,,we've seen the worst of it.,But maybe on that day we also find that the Greenland ice sheet,is really melting unacceptably fast, fast enough to put meters of sea level on,the oceans in the next 100 years,,and remove some of the biggest cities from the map.,That's an absolutely possible scenario.,We might decide at that point that even though geo-engineering was uncertain,and morally unhappy, that it's a lot better than not geo-engineering.,And that's a very different way to look at the problem.,It's using this as risk control, not instead of action.,It's saying that you do some geo-engineering for a little while,to take the worst of the heat off, not that you'd use it as a substitute for action. 
 But there is a problem with that view.,And the problem is the following:,knowledge that geo-engineering is possible makes,the climate impacts look less fearsome,,and that makes a weaker commitment to cutting emissions today.,This is what economists call a moral hazard.,And that's one of the fundamental reasons that this problem is so hard to talk about,,and, in general, I think it's the underlying reason,that it's been politically unacceptable to talk about this.,But you don't make good policy by hiding things in a drawer. 
 I'll leave you with three questions, and then one final quote.,Should we do serious research on this topic?,Should we have a national research program that looks at this?,Not just at how you would do it better,,but also what all the risks and downsides of it are.,Right now, you have a few enthusiasts talking about it, some in a positive side,,some in a negative side -- but that's a dangerous state to be in,because there's very little depth of knowledge on this topic.,A very small amount of money would get us some.,Many of us -- maybe now me -- think we should do that.,But I have a lot of reservations.,My reservations are principally about the moral hazard problem,,and I don't really know how we can best avoid the moral hazard.,I think there is a serious problem: as you talk about this,,people begin to think they don't need to work so hard to cut emissions. 
 Another thing is, maybe we need a treaty.,A treaty that decides who gets to do this.,Right now we may think of a big, rich country like the U.S. doing this.,But it might well be that, in fact, if China wakes up in 2030 and realizes,that the climate impacts are just unacceptable,,they may not be very interested in our moral conversations about how to do this,,and they may just decide they'd really rather have a geo-engineered world,than a non-geo-engineered world.,And we'll have no international mechanism to figure out who makes the decision. 
 So here's one last thought, which was said much, much better,25 years ago in the U.S. National Academy report than I can say today.,And I think it really summarizes where we are here.,That the CO2 problem, the climate problem that we've heard about,,is driving lots of things -- innovations in the energy technologies,that will reduce emissions --,but also, I think, inevitably, it will drive us towards thinking about climate,and weather control, whether we like it or not.,And it's time to begin thinking about it,,even if the reason we're thinking about it is to construct arguments,for why we shouldn't do it.,Thank you very much.What is bioenergy? Bioenergy is not ethanol.,Bioenergy isn't global warming. Bioenergy is,something which seems counterintuitive. Bioenergy,is oil. It's gas. It's coal. And part of building,that bridge to the future, to the point where we,can actually see the oceans in a rational way, or,put up these geo-spatial orbits that will twirl or,do microwaves or stuff, is going to depend on how,we understand bioenergy and manage it. And to do,that, you really have to look first at agriculture. 
 So we've been planting stuff for 11,000 years. And,in the measure that we plant stuff, what we learn,from agriculture is you've got to deal with pests,,you've got to deal with all types of awful things,,you've got to cultivate stuff. In the measure,that you learn how to use water to cultivate, then,you're going to be able to spread beyond the Nile.,You're going to be able to power stuff, so irrigation,makes a difference. 
 Irrigation starts to make you be allowed to plant,stuff where you want it, as opposed to where the,rivers flood. You start getting this organic,agriculture; you start putting machinery onto this,stuff. Machinery, with a whole bunch of water,,leads to very large-scale agriculture.,You put together machines and water, and you get,landscapes that look like this. And then you get,sales that look like this. It's brute force. So,what you've been doing in agriculture is you start,out with something that's a reasonably natural,system. You start taming that natural system. You,put a lot of force behind that natural system. You,put a whole bunch of pesticides and herbicides --,(Laughter) -- behind that natural system, and you,end up with systems that look like this. 
 And it's all brute force. And that's the way we've,been approaching energy. So the lesson in,agriculture is that you can actually change the,system that's based on brute force as you start,merging that system and learning that system and,actually applying biology. And you move from a,discipline of engineering, you move from a,discipline of chemistry, into a discipline of,biology. And probably one of the most important,human beings on the planet is this guy behind me. 
 This is a guy called Norman Borlaug. He won the,Nobel Prize. He's got the Congressional Medal of,Honor. He deserves all of this stuff. And he,deserves this stuff because he probably has fed,more people than any other human being alive,because he researched how to put biology behind,seeds. He did this in Mexico. The reason why India,and China no longer have these massive famines is,because Norman Borlaug taught them how to grow,grains in a more efficient way and launched the,Green Revolution. That is something that a lot of,people have criticized. But of course, those are,people who don't realize that China and India,,instead of having huge amounts of starving people,,are exporting grains. 
 And the irony of this particular system is the,place where he did the research, which was Mexico,,didn't adopt this technology, ignored this,technology, talked about why this technology,should be thought about, but not really applied.,And Mexico remains one of the largest grain,importers on the planet because it doesn't apply,technology that was discovered in Mexico. And in,fact, hasn't recognized this man, to the point,where there aren't statues of this man all over,Mexico. There are in China and India. And the,Institute that this guy ran has now moved to,India. That is the difference between adopting,technologies and discussing technologies.,Now, it's not just that this guy fed a huge amount,of people in the world. It's that this is the net,effect in terms of what technology does, if you,understand biology. 
 What happened in agriculture? Well, if you take,agriculture over a century, agriculture in about,1900 would have been recognizable to somebody,planting a thousand years earlier. Yeah, the plows look,different. The machines were tractors or stuff,instead of mules, but the farmer would have,understood: this is what the guy's doing, this is,why he's doing it, this is where he's going. What,really started to change in agriculture is when,you started moving from this brute force,engineering and chemistry into biology, and that's,where you get your productivity increases. And as,you do that stuff, here's what happens to,productivity. 
 Basically, you go from 250 hours to produce 100,bushels, to 40, to 15, to five. Agricultural labor,productivity increased seven times, 1950 to 2000,,whereas the rest of the economy increased about,2.5 times. This is an absolutely massive increase,in how much is produced per person.,The effect of this, of course, is it's not just,amber waves of grain, it is mountains of stuff.,And 50 percent of the EU budget is going to subsidize,agriculture from mountains of stuff that people,have overproduced. 
 This would be a good outcome for energy. And of,course, by now, you're probably saying to,yourself, "Self, I thought I came to a talk about,energy and here's this guy talking about biology.",So where's the link between these two things?,One of the ironies of this whole system is we're,discussing what to do about a system that we don't,understand. We don't even know what oil is. We,don't know where oil comes from. I mean,,literally, it's still a source of debate what,this black river of stuff is and where it comes,from. The best assumption, and one of the best,guesses in this stuff, is that this stuff comes,out of this stuff, that these things absorb,sunlight, rot under pressure for millions of,years, and you get these black rivers. 
 Now, the interesting thing about that thesis -- if,that thesis turns out to be true -- is that oil,,and all hydrocarbons, turned out to be,concentrated sunlight. And if you think of,bioenergy, bioenergy isn't ethanol. Bioenergy is,taking the sun, concentrating it in amoebas,,concentrating it in plants, and maybe that's why,you get these rainbows.,And as you're looking at this system, if,hydrocarbons are concentrated sunlight, then,bioenergy works in a different way. And we've got,to start thinking of oil and other hydrocarbons as,part of these solar panels.,Maybe that's one of the reasons why if you fly,over west Texas, the types of wells that you're,beginning to see don't look unlike those pictures,of Kansas and those irrigated plots. 
 This is how you farm oil. And as you think of,farming oil and how oil has evolved, we started,with this brute force approach. And then what did,we learn? Then we learned we had to go bigger. And,then what'd we learn? Then we have to go even,bigger. And we are getting really destructive as,we're going out and farming this bioenergy.,These are the Athabasca tar sands, and there's an,enormous amount -- first of mining, the largest,trucks in the world are working here, and then,you've got to pull out this black sludge, which is,basically oil that doesn't flow. It's tied to the,sand. And then you've got to use a lot of steam to,separate it, which only works at today's oil,prices. 
 Coal. Coal turns out to be virtually the same,stuff. It is probably plants, except that these,have been burned and crushed under pressure.,So you take something like this, you burn it, you,put it under pressure, and likely as not, you get,this. Although, again, I stress: we don't know.,Which is curious as we debate all this stuff. But,as you think of coal, this is what burned wheat,kernels look like. Not entirely unlike coal. 
 And of course, coalmines are very dangerous,places because in some of these coalmines, you,get gas. When that gas blows up, people die. So,you're producing a biogas out of coal in some,mines, but not in others.,Any place you see a differential, there're some,interesting questions. There's some questions as,to what you should be doing with this stuff. But,again, coal. Maybe the same stuff, maybe the same,system, maybe bioenergy, and you're applying,exactly the same technology. 
 Here's your brute force approach. Once you get,through your brute force approach, then you just,rip off whole mountaintops. And you end up with,the single largest source of carbon emissions,,which are coal-fired gas plants. That is probably,not the best use of bioenergy.,As you think of what are the alternatives to this,system -- it's important to find alternatives,because it turns out that the U.S. is dwindling in,its petroleum reserves, but it is not dwindling in,its coal reserves, nor is China. There are huge,coal reserves that are sitting out there, and,we've got to start thinking of them as biological,energy, because if we keep treating them as,chemical energy, or engineering energy, we're,going to be in deep doo-doo. 
 Gas is a similar issue. Gas is also a biological,product. And as you think of gas, well, you're,familiar with gas. And here's a different way of,mining coal.,This is called coal bed methane. Why is this,picture interesting? Because if coal turns out to,be concentrated plant life, the reason why you may,get a differential in gas output between one mine,and another -- the reason why one mine may blow up,and another one may not blow up -- may be because,there's stuff eating that stuff and producing gas.,This is a well-known phenomenon. (Laughter) You,eat certain things, you produce a lot of gas. It,may turn out that biological processes in coalmines,have the same process. If that is true, then,one of the ways of getting the energy out of coal,may not be to rip whole mountaintops off, and it,may not be to burn coal. It may be to have stuff,process that coal in a biological fashion as you,did in agriculture. 
 That is what bioenergy is. It is not ethanol. It,is not subsidies to a few companies. It is not,importing corn into Iowa because you've built so,many of these ethanol plants. It is beginning to,understand the transition that occurred in,agriculture, from brute force into biological,force. And in the measure that you can do that,,you can clean some stuff, and you can clean it,pretty quickly.,We already have some indicators of productivity on,this stuff. OK, if you put steam into coal fields,or petroleum fields that have been running for,decades, you can get a really substantial,increase, like an eight-fold increase, in your,output. This is just the beginning stages of this,stuff. 
 And as you think of biomaterials, this guy -- who,did part of the sequencing of the human genome,,who just doubled the databases of genes and,proteins known on earth by sailing around the,world -- has been thinking about how you structure,this. And there's a series of smart people,thinking about this. And they've been putting,together companies like Synthetic Genomics, like,,a Cambria, like Codon, and what those companies are,trying to do is to think of, how do you apply,biological principles to avoid brute force?,Think of it in the following terms. Think of it as,beginning to program stuff for specific purposes.,Think of the cell as a hardware. Think of the,genes as a software. And in the measure that you,begin to think of life as code that is,interchangeable, that can become energy, that can,become food, that can become fiber, that can,become human beings, that can become a whole,series of things, then you've got to shift your,approach as to how you're going to structure and,deal and think about energy in a very different,way. 
 What are the first principles of this stuff and,where are we heading? This is one of the gentle,giants on the planet. He's one of the nicest human,beings you've ever met. His name is Hamilton,Smith. He won the Nobel for figuring out how to,cut genes -- something called restriction enzymes.,He was at Hopkins when he did this, and he's such,a modest guy that the day he won, his mother,called him and said, "I didn't realize there was,another Ham Smith at Hopkins. Do you know he just,won the Nobel?" (Laughter) I mean, that was Mom,,but anyway, this guy is just a class act. You find,him at the bench every single day, working on a,pipette and building stuff. And one of the things,this guy just built are these things. 
 What is this? This is the first transplant of,naked DNA, where you take an entire DNA operating,system out of one cell, insert it into a different,cell, and have that cell boot up as a separate,species. That's one month old. You will see stuff,in the next month that will be just as important,as this stuff.,And as you think about this stuff and what the,implications of this are, we're going to start not,just converting ethanol from corn with very high,subsidies. We're going to start thinking about,biology entering energy. It is very expensive to,process this stuff, both in economic terms and in,energy terms. 
 This is what accumulates in the tar sands of,Alberta. These are sulfur blocks. Because as you,separate that petroleum from the sand, and use an,enormous amount of energy inside that vapor --,steam to separate this stuff -- you also have to,separate out the sulfur. The difference between,light crude and heavy crude -- well, it's about 14,bucks a barrel. That's why you're building these,pyramids of sulfur blocks. And by the way, the,scale on these things is pretty large. 
 Now, if you can take part of the energy content,out of doing this, you reduce the system, and you,really do start applying biological principles to,energy. This has to be a bridge to the point where,you can get to wind, to the point where you can,get to solar, to the point where you can get to,nuclear -- and hopefully you won't build the next,nuclear plant on a beautiful seashore next to an,earthquake fault. (Laughter) Just a thought. 
 But in the meantime, for the next decade at least,,the name of the game is hydrocarbons. And be that,oil, be that gas, be that coal, this is what we're,dealing with. And before I make this talk too,long, here's what's happening in the current,energy system.,86 percent of the energy we consume are,hydrocarbons. That means 86 percent of the stuff we're,consuming are probably processed plants and,amoebas and the rest of the stuff. And there's a,role in here for conservation. There's a role in,here for alternative stuff, but we've also got to,get that other portion right.,How we deal with that other portion is our bridge,to the future. And as we think of this bridge to,the future, one of the things you should ponder,is: we are leaving about two-thirds of the oil today,inside those wells. So we're spending an enormous,amount of money and leaving most of the energy,down there. Which, of course, requires more energy,to go out and get energy. The ratios become,idiotic by the time you get to ethanol. It may,even be a one-to-one ratio on the energy input and,the energy output. That is a stupid way of,managing this system. 
 Last point, last graph. One of the things that,we've got to do is to stabilize oil prices. This,is what oil prices look like, OK?,This is a very bad system because what happens is,your hurdle rate gets set very low. People come up,with really smart ideas for solar panels, or for,wind, or for something else, and then guess what?,The oil price goes through the floor. That company,goes out of business, and then you can bring the,oil price back up. 
 So if I had one closing and modest suggestion,,let's set a stable oil price in Europe and the,United States. How do you do that? Well, let's put,a tax on oil that is a non-revenue tax, and it,basically says for the next 20 years, the price of,oil will be -- whatever you want, 35 bucks, 40,bucks. If the OPEC price falls below that, we tax,it. If the OPEC price goes above that, the tax,goes away.,What does that do for entrepreneurs? What does it,do for companies? It tells people, if you can,produce energy for less than 35 bucks a barrel, or,less than 40 bucks a barrel, or less than 50 bucks,a barrel -- let's debate it -- you will have a,business. But let's not put people through this,cycle where it doesn't pay to research because,your company will go out of business as OPEC,drives alternatives and keeps bioenergy from,happening. Thank you.I thought I'd tell you a little about what I like to write.,And I like to immerse myself in my topics.,I just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig.,And I see my life as a series of experiments. 
 So, I work for Esquire magazine, and a couple of years ago,,I wrote an article called "My Outsourced Life,",where I hired a team of people in Bangalore, India,,to live my life for me.,So, they answered my emails.,They answered my phone.,They argued with my wife for me, and they read my son bedtime stories.,It was the best month of my life,,because I just sat back and I read books and watched movies.,It was a wonderful experience. 
 More recently, I wrote an article for Esquire called --,about radical honesty.,And this is a movement where --,this is started by a psychologist in Virginia,,who says that you should never, ever lie,,except maybe during poker and golf, his only exceptions.,And, more than that, whatever is on your brain,should come out of your mouth.,So, I decided I would try this for a month.,This was the worst month of my life.,(Laughter),I do not recommend this at all.,To give you a sense of the experience,,the article was called, "I Think You're Fat.",(Laughter),So, that was hard. 
 My most recent book -- my previous book was called "The Know-It-All,",and it was about the year I spent reading the Encyclopedia Britannica,from A to Z in my quest to learn everything in the world,,or more precisely from Aak, which is a type of East Asian music,,all the way to Zwyiec, which is -- well, I don't want to ruin the ending.,(Laughter),It's a very exciting twist ending, like an O. Henry novel, so I won't ruin it.,But I love that one,,because that was an experiment about how much information,one human brain could absorb.,Although, listening to Kevin Kelly, you don't have to remember anything.,You can just Google it.,So, I wasted some time there. 
 I love those experiments,,but I think that the most profound,and life-changing experiment that I've done,is my most recent experiment, where I spent a year,trying to follow all of the rules of the Bible,,"The Year of Living Biblically.",And I undertook this for two reasons.,The first was that I grew up with no religion at all.,As I say in my book, I'm Jewish in the same way,the Olive Garden is Italian.,(Laughter),So, not very.,But I've become increasingly interested in religion.,I do think it's the defining issue of our time,,or one of the main ones.,And I have a son. I want to know what to teach him.,So, I decided to dive in head first, and try to live the Bible. 
 The second reason I undertook this is because,I'm concerned about the rise of fundamentalism,,religious fundamentalism, and people who say,they take the Bible literally, which is, according to some polls,,as high as 45 or 50 percent of America.,So I decided, what if you really did take the Bible literally?,I decided to take it to its logical conclusion,and take everything in the Bible literally,,without picking and choosing. 
 The first thing I did was I got a stack of bibles.,I had Christian bibles.,I had Jewish bibles.,A friend of mine sent me something called a hip-hop bible,,where the twenty-third Psalm is rendered as, "The Lord is all that,",as opposed to what I knew it as, "The Lord is my shepherd." 
 Then I went down and I read several versions,,and I wrote down every single law that I could find.,And this was a very long list -- over 700 rules.,And they range from the famous ones that I had heard of --,The Ten Commandments, love your neighbor, be fruitful and multiply.,So I wanted to follow those.,And actually, I take my projects very seriously,,because I had twins during my year,,so I definitely take my projects seriously. 
 But I also wanted to follow the hundreds,of arcane and obscure laws that are in the Bible.,There is the law in Leviticus,,"You cannot shave the corners of your beard.",I didn't know where my corners were,,so I decided to let the whole thing grow,,and this is what I looked like by the end.,As you can imagine, I spent a lot of time at airport security.,(Laughter),My wife wouldn't kiss me for the last two months.,So, certainly the challenge was there. 
 The Bible says you cannot wear clothes made of mixed fibers,,so I thought, "Sounds strange, but I'll try it.",You only know if you try it.,I got rid of all my poly-cotton T-shirts.,The Bible says that if two men are in a fight,,and the wife of one of those men grabs the testicles of the other man,,then her hand shall be cut off.,So, I wanted to follow that rule.,(Laughter),That one I followed by default,,by not getting in a fight with a man whose wife was standing nearby,,looking like she had a strong grip.,(Laughter),So -- oh, there's another shot of my beard. 
 I will say it was an amazing year,because it really was life changing, and incredibly challenging.,And there were two types of laws that were particularly challenging.,The first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day.,You know, I could spend a year not killing,,but spending a year not gossiping, not coveting, not lying --,you know, I live in New York, and I work as a journalist,,so this was 75, 80 percent of my day I had to do it. 
 But it was really interesting, because I was able to make some progress,,because I couldn't believe how much,my behavior changed my thoughts.,This was one of the huge lessons of the year,,is that I almost pretended to be a better person,,and I became a little bit of a better person.,So I had always thought, you know, "You change your mind,,and you change your behavior," but it's often the other way around.,You change your behavior, and you change your mind.,So, you know, if you want to become more compassionate,,you visit sick people in the hospital,,and you will become more compassionate.,You donate money to a cause,,and you become emotionally involved in that cause.,So, it really was cognitive psychology --,you know, cognitive dissonance -- that I was experiencing.,The Bible actually talks about cognitive psychology,,very primitive cognitive psychology.,In the Proverbs, it says that if you smile, you will become happier,,which, as we know, is actually true. 
 The second type of rule that was difficult to obey,was the rules that will get you into a little trouble,in twenty-first-century America.,And perhaps the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers.,(Laughter),But it's a big part of the Bible,,so I figured I had to address it.,So, I was able to stone one adulterer.,It happened -- I was in the park, and I was dressed in my biblical clothing,,so sandals and sort of a white robe,,you know, because again, the outer affects the inner.,I wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind.,And this man came up to me and he said,,"Why are you dressed like that?",And I explained my project,,and he said, "Well, I am an adulterer, are you going to stone me?",And I said, "Well, that would be great!",(Laughter),And I actually took out a handful of stones from my pocket,that I had been carrying around for weeks,,hoping for just this interaction -- and, you know, they were pebbles --,but he grabbed them out of my hand.,He was actually an elderly man, mid-70s, just so you know.,But he's still an adulterer, and still quite angry.,He grabbed them out of my hand,and threw them at my face, and I felt that I could --,eye for an eye -- I could retaliate, and throw one back at him. 
 So that was my experience stoning, and it did allow me,to talk about, in a more serious way, these big issues.,How can the Bible be so barbaric in some places,,and yet so incredibly wise in others?,How should we view the Bible?,Should we view it, you know, as original intent,,like a sort of a Scalia version of the Bible?,How was the Bible written?,And actually, since this is a tech crowd,,I talk in the book about how the Bible actually reminds me,of the Wikipedia, because it has all of these authors and editors,over hundreds of years.,And it's sort of evolved.,It's not a book that was written and came down from on high. 
 So I thought I would end by telling you,just a couple of the take-aways, the bigger lessons,that I learned from my year.,The first is, thou shalt not take the Bible literally.,This became very, very clear, early on.,Because if you do, then you end up acting like a crazy person,,and stoning adulterers, or -- here's another example.,Well, that's another. I did spend some time shepherding.,(Laughter),It's a very relaxing vocation. I recommend it. 
 But this one is -- the Bible says that you cannot touch women,during certain times of the month, and more than that,,you cannot sit on a seat where a menstruating woman has sat.,And my wife thought this was very offensive,,so she sat in every seat in our apartment,,and I had to spend much of the year standing,until I bought my own seat and carried it around. 
 So, you know, I met with creationists.,I went to the creationists' museum.,And these are the ultimate literalists.,And it was fascinating, because they were not stupid people at all.,I would wager that their IQ is exactly the same as the average evolutionist.,It's just that their faith is so strong,in this literal interpretation of the Bible,that they distort all the data to fit their model.,And they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this. 
 And I will say, though, the museum is gorgeous.,They really did a fantastic job.,If you're ever in Kentucky,,there's, you can see a movie of the flood,,and they have sprinklers in the ceiling,that will sprinkle on you during the flood scenes.,So, whatever you think of creationism -- and I think it's crazy --,they did a great job.,(Laughter) 
 Another lesson is that thou shalt give thanks.,And this one was a big lesson because I was praying,,giving these prayers of thanksgiving, which was odd for an agnostic.,But I was saying thanks all the time, every day,,and I started to change my perspective.,And I started to realize the hundreds of little things,that go right every day, that I didn't even notice,,that I took for granted, as opposed to focusing,on the three or four that went wrong.,So, this is actually a key to happiness for me,,is to just remember when I came over here,,the car didn't flip over, and I didn't trip coming up the stairs.,It's a remarkable thing. 
 Third, that thou shall have reverence.,This one was unexpected because I started the year,as an agnostic, and by the end of the year,,I became what a friend of mine calls a reverent agnostic, which I love.,And I'm trying to start it as a movement.,So, if anyone wants to join,,the basic idea is, whether or not there is a God,,there's something important and beautiful about the idea of sacredness,,and that our rituals can be sacred.,The Sabbath can be sacred.,This was one of the great things about my year, doing the Sabbath,,because I am a workaholic, so having this one day,where you cannot work, it really, that changed my life.,So, this idea of sacredness, whether or not there is a God. 
 Thou shall not stereotype.,This one happened because,I spent a lot of time with various religious communities,throughout America because I wanted it to be more,than about my journey.,I wanted it to be about religion in America.,So, I spent time with evangelical Christians, and Hasidic Jews, and the Amish.,I'm very proud because,I think I'm the only person in America,to out Bible-talk a Jehovah's Witness.,(Laughter),After three and a half hours, he looked at his watch,,he's like, "I gotta go.",(Laughter),Oh, thank you very much.,Thank you. Bless you, bless you. 
 But it was interesting,because I had some very preconceived notions about, for instance,,evangelical Christianity, and I found that,it's such a wide and varied movement,that it is difficult to make generalizations about it.,There's a group I met with called the Red Letter Christians,,and they focus on the red words in the Bible,,which are the ones that Jesus spoke.,That's how they printed them in the old Bibles.,And their argument is that Jesus never talked about homosexuality.,They have a pamphlet that says,,"Here's what Jesus said about homosexuality,",and you open it up, and there's nothing in it.,So, they say Jesus did talk a lot about helping the outcasts,,helping poor people.,So, this was very inspiring to me.,I recommend Jim Wallis and Tony Campolo.,They're very inspiring leaders, even though I disagree,with much of what they say. 
 Also, thou shalt not disregard the irrational.,This one was very unexpected because, you know,,I grew up with the scientific worldview,,and I was shocked learning how much of my life,is governed by irrational forces.,And the thing is, if they're not harmful,,they're not to be completely dismissed.,Because I learned that -- I was thinking, I was,doing all these rituals, these biblical rituals,,separating my wool and linen, and I would ask these religious people,"Why would the Bible possibly tell us to do this? Why would God care?",And they said, "We don't know,,but it's just rituals that give us meaning.",And I would say, "But that's crazy.",And they would say, "Well, what about you?,You blow out candles on top of a birthday cake.,If a guy from Mars came down and saw, here's one guy,blowing out the fire on top of a cake,versus another guy not wearing clothes of mixed fabrics,,would the Martians say, 'Well, that guy, he makes sense,,but that guy's crazy?'",So no, I think that rituals are, by nature, irrational.,So the key is to choose the right rituals,,the ones that are not harmful -- but rituals by themselves,are not to be dismissed. 
 And finally I learned that thou shall pick and choose.,And this one I learned because,I tried to follow everything in the Bible.,And I failed miserably.,Because you can't.,You have to pick and choose. And anyone who follows the Bible,is going to be picking and choosing.,The key is to pick and choose the right parts.,There's the phrase called cafeteria religion,,and the fundamentalists will use it in a denigrating way,,and they'll say, "Oh, it's just cafeteria religion.,You're just picking and choosing.",But my argument is, "What's wrong with cafeterias?",I've had some great meals at cafeterias.,I've also had some meals that make me want to dry heave.,So, it's about choosing the parts of the Bible about compassion,,about tolerance, about loving your neighbor,,as opposed to the parts about homosexuality is a sin,,or intolerance, or violence,,which are very much in the Bible as well.,So if we are to find any meaning in this book,,then we have to really engage it, and wrestle with it. 
 And I thought I'd end with just a couple more.,There's me reading the Bible.,That's how I hailed taxicabs.,(Laughter),Seriously, and it worked. And yes,,that was actually a rented sheep,,so I had to return that in the morning, but it served well for a day.,So, anyway, thank you so much for letting me speak.Dogs have interests.,They have interest sniffing each other, chasing squirrels.,And if we don't make that a reward in training, that will be a distraction.,It's always sort of struck me as really a scary thought,that if you see a dog in a park, and the owner is calling it,,and the owner says, you know, "Puppy, come here, come here,",and the dog thinks, "Hmm, interesting.,I'm sniffing this other dog's rear end, the owner's calling.",It's a difficult choice, right?,Rear end, owner. Rear end wins.,I mean, you lose.,You cannot compete with the environment,,if you have an adolescent dog's brain.,So, when we train, we're always trying to take into account,the dog's point of view. 
 Now, I'm here largely because,there's kind of a rift in dog training at the moment,that -- on one side, we have people who think that you train a dog,,number one, by making up rules, human rules.,We don't take the dog's point of view into account.,So the human says, "You're going to act this way, damn it.,We're going to force you to act against your will, to bend to our will.",Then, number two, we keep these rules a secret from the dog.,And then number three, now we can punish the dog,for breaking rules he didn't even know existed.,So you get a little puppy, he comes. His only crime is he grew.,When he was a little puppy, he puts his paws on your leg --,you know, isn't that nice?,And you go, "Oh, there's a good boy.",You bend down, you pat him -- you reward him for jumping up.,His one mistake is he's a Tibetan mastiff, and a few months later,,he weighs, you know, 80 pounds.,Every time he jumps up, he gets all sorts of abuse.,I mean, it is really very, very scary the abuse that dogs get. 
 So, this whole dominance issue -- number one,,what we get in dog training is this Mickey-Mouse interpretation,of a very complicated social system.,And they take this stuff seriously.,Male dogs are very serious about a hierarchy,,because it prevents physical fights.,Of course, female dogs, bitches, on the other hand,,have several bitch amendments to male hierarchical rule.,The number one is, "I have it, you don't.",And what you will find is a very, very low-ranking bitch,will quite easily keep a bone away from a high-ranking male.,So, we get in dog training this notion of dominances,,or of the alpha dog. I'm sure that you've heard this. 
 Dogs get so abused.,Dogs, horses and humans --,these are the three species which are so abused in life.,And the reason is built into their behavior --,is to always come back and apologize.,Like, "Oh, I'm sorry you had to beat me. I'm really sorry, yes, it's my fault.",They are just so beatable,,and that's why they get beaten.,The poor puppy jumps up, you open the dog book, what does it say?,"Hold his front paws, squeeze his front paws,,stamp on his hind feet, squirt him in the face with lemon juice,,hit him on the head with a rolled-up newspaper,,knee him in the chest, flip him over backwards.",Because he grew?,And because he's performing a behavior you've trained him to do?,This is insanity.,I ask owners, "Well, how would you like the dog to greet you?",And people say, "Well, I don't know, to sit, I guess.",I said, "Let's teach him to sit.",And then we give him a reason for sitting.,Because the first stage,is basically teaching a dog ESL.,I could speak to you and say, "Laytay-chai, paisey, paisey.",Go on, something should happen now.,Why aren't you responding? Oh, you don't speak Swahili.,Well, I've got news for you.,The dog doesn't speak English, or American, or Spanish, or French. 
 So the first stage in training is to teach the dog ESL,,English as a second language.,And that's how we use the food lure in the hand,,and we use food because we're dealing with owners.,My wife doesn't need food -- she's a great trainer,,much better than I am.,I don't need food, but the average owner says,,"Puppy, sit.",Or they go, "Sit, sit, sit.",They're making a hand signal in front of the dog's rectum for some reason,,like the dog has a third eye there -- it's insane.,You know, "Sit, sit.",No, we go, "Puppy, sit" -- boom, it's got it in six to 10 trials. 
 Then we phase out the food as a lure,,and now the dog knows that "sit" means sit,,and you can actually communicate to a dog,in a perfectly constructed English sentence.,"Phoenix, come here, take this, and go to Jamie, please.",And I've taught her "Phoenix," "come here," "take this," "go to",and the name of my son, "Jamie.",And the dog can take a note,,and I've got my own little search-and-rescue dog.,He'll find Jamie wherever he is, you know,,wherever kids are, crushing rocks by a stream or something,,and take him a little message that says,,"Hey, dinner's ready. Come in for dinner." 
 So, at this point, the dog knows what we want it to do.,Will it do it?,Not necessarily, no.,As I said, if he's in the park and there's a rear end to sniff,,why come to the owner?,The dog lives with you, the dog can get you any time.,The dog can sniff your butt, if you like, when he wants to.,At the moment, he's in the park, and you are competing,with smells, and other dogs, and squirrels. 
 So the second stage in training is to teach the dog to want to do,what we want him to do, and this is very easy.,We use the Premack principle.,Basically, we follow a low-frequency behavior --,one the dog doesn't want to do --,by a high-frequency behavior, commonly known as a behavior problem,,or a dog hobby -- something the dog does like to do.,That will then become a reward for the lower-frequency behavior.,So we go, "sit," on the couch; "sit," tummy-rub; "sit,",look, I throw a tennis ball; "sit," say hello to that other dog.,Yes, we put "sniff butt" on queue.,"Sit," sniff butt. 
 So now all of these distractions that worked against training,now become rewards that work for training.,And what we're doing, in essence, is we're teaching the dog, kind of like --,we're letting the dog think that the dog is training us.,And I can imagine this dog, you know,,speaking through the fence to, say, an Akita,,saying, "Wow, my owners, they are so incredibly easy to train.,They're like Golden Retrievers.,All I have to do is sit, and they do everything.,They open doors, they drive my car, they massage me,,they will throw tennis balls,,they will cook for me and serve the food.,It's like, if I just sit, that's my command.,Then I have my own personal doorman,,chauffeur, masseuse, chef and waiter.",And now the dog's really happy.,And this, to me, is always what training is.,So we really motivate the dog to want to do it,,such that the need for punishment seldom comes up. 
 Now we move to phase three, when now --,there's times, you know, when daddy knows best.,And I have a little sign on my fridge, and it says,,"Because I'm the daddy, that's why.",Sorry, no more explanation. "I'm the daddy, you're not. Sit.",And there's times, for example,,if my son's friends leave the door open,,the dogs have to know you don't step across this line.,This is a life-or-death thing.,You leave this, the sanctity of your house,,and you could be hit on the street.,So some things we have to let the dog know,,"You mustn't do this." 
 And so we have to enforce, but without force.,People here get very confused about what a punishment is.,They think a punishment is something nasty.,I bet a lot of you do, right?,You think it's something painful, or scary, or nasty.,It doesn't have to be.,There's several definitions of what a punishment is,,but one definition, the most popular, is:,a punishment is a stimulus that reduces the immediately preceding behavior,,such that it's less likely to occur in the future.,It does not have to be nasty, scary or painful.,And I would say, if it doesn't have to be, then maybe it shouldn't be. 
 I was working with a very dangerous dog about a year ago.,And this was a dog that put both his owners in hospital,,plus the brother-in-law, plus the child.,And I only agreed to work with it if they promised it would stay in their house,,and they never took it outside.,The dog is actually euthanized now,,but this was a dog I worked with for a while.,A lot of the aggression happened around the kitchen,,so while I was there -- this was on the fourth visit --,we did a four and a half hour down-stay, with the dog on his mat.,And he was kept there by the owner's calm insistence.,When the dog would try to leave the mat,,she would say, "Rover, on the mat, on the mat, on the mat.",The dog broke his down-stay 22 times in four and a half hours, while she cooked dinner,,because we had a lot of aggression related towards food.,The breaks got fewer and fewer.,You see, the punishment was working.,The behavior problem was going away.,She never raised her voice.,If she did, she would have got bitten.,It's not a good dog you shout at.,And a lot of my friends train really neat animals,,grizzly bears -- if you've ever seen a grizzly bear,on the telly or in film, then it's a friend of mine who's trained it --,killer whales. I love it because it wires you up.,How are you going to reprimand a grizzly bear?,"Bad bear, bad bear!" Voom!,Your head now is 100 yards away, sailing through the air, OK?,This is crazy. 
 So, where do we go from here?,We want a better way.,Dogs deserve better.,But for me, the reason for this actually has to do with dogs.,It has to do with watching people train puppies,,and realizing they have horrendous interaction skills,,horrendous relationship skills.,Not just with their puppy, but with the rest of the family at class.,I mean, my all-time classic is another "come here" one.,You see someone in the park -- and I'll cover my mic when I say this,,because I don't want to wake you up -- and there's the owner in the park,,and their dog's over here, and they say, "Rover, come here.,Rover, come here. Rover, come here, you son of a bitch.",The dog says, "I don't think so.",(Laughter),I mean, who in their right mind,would think that a dog would want to approach them,when they're screaming like that?,Instead, the dog says, "I know that tone. I know that tone.,Previously, when I've approached, I've gotten punished there.",I was walking onto a plane --,this, for me, was a pivotal moment in my career,,and it really cemented what I wanted to do,with this whole puppy-training thing,,the notion of how to teach puppies in a dog-friendly way,to want to do what we want to do, so we don't have to force them.,You know, I puppy-train my child.,And the seminal moment was, I was getting on a plane in Dallas,,and in row two was a father, I presume, and a young boy about five,,kicking the back of the chair.,"Johnny, don't do that.",Kick, kick, kick.,"Johnny, don't do that." Kick, kick, kick.,I'm standing right here with my bag.,The father leans over, grabs him like this and gives him ugly face.,And ugly face is this --,when you go face-to-face with a puppy or a child,,you say, "What are you doing! Now stop it, stop it, stop it!",And I went, "Oh my God, do I do something?",That child has lost everything --,that one of the two people he can trust in this world,has absolutely pulled the rug from under his feet.,And I thought, "Do I tell this jerk to quit it?",I thought, "Ian, stay out of it, stay out of it, you know, walk on.",I walked to the back of the plane,,I sat down, and a thought came to me.,If that had been a dog, I would have laid him out.,(Laughter),If he had kicked a dog, I would have punched him out.,He kicked a child, grabs the child like this and I let it go. 
 And this is what it's all about.,These relationship skills are so easy.,I mean, we as humans, our shallowness when we choose a life-mate,based on the three Cs -- coat color, conformation, cuteness.,You know, kind of like a little robot.,This is how we go into a relationship, and it's hunky-dory for a year.,And then, a little behavior problem comes up.,No different from the dog barking.,The husband won't clear up his clothes,,or the wife's always late for meetings, whatever it is, OK?,And it then starts, and we get into this thing,,and our personal feedback -- there's two things about it.,When you watch people interacting with animals or other people,,there is very little feedback, it's too infrequent.,And when it happens, it's bad, it's nasty.,You see it's especially in families, especially with spouses,,especially with children, especially with parents.,You see it especially in the workplace,,especially from boss to employee.,It's as if there's some schadenfreude there,,that we actually take delight in people getting things wrong,,so that we can then moan and groan and bitch at them. 
 And this, I would say, is the biggest human foible that we have.,It really is.,We take the good for granted, and we moan and groan at the bad.,And I think this whole notion of these skills should be taught.,You know, calculus is wonderful.,When I was a kid, I was a calculus whiz.,I don't understand a thing about it now, but I could do it as a kid.,Geometry, fantastic. You know, quantum mechanics --,these are cool things.,But they don't save marriages and they don't raise children. 
 And my look to the future is,,and what I want to do with this doggy stuff, is to teach people,that you know, your husband's just as easy to train.,Probably easier -- if you got a Rottie -- much easier to train.,Your kids are easy to train.,All you've got to do is to watch them,,to time-sample the behavior, and say, every five minutes,,you ask the question, "Is it good, or is it bad?",If it's good, say, "That was really neat, thank you.",That is such a powerful training technique.,This should be taught in schools.,Relationships -- how do you negotiate?,How you do negotiate with your friend who wants your toy?,You know, how to prepare you for your first relationship?,How on earth about raising children?,We think how we do it -- one night in bed, we're pregnant,,and then we're raising the most important thing in life, a child.,No, this is what should be taught -- the good living, the good habits,,which are just as hard to break as bad habits.,So, that would be my wish to the future.,Ah, damn, I wanted to end exactly on time,,but I got eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two --,so thank you very much. That's my talk, thank you.,(Applause)My thing with school lunch is, it's a social justice issue.,I'm the Director of Nutrition Services,for the Berkeley Unified School District. I have 90 employees,and 17 locations, 9,600 kids.,I'm doing 7,100 meals a day,and I've been doing it for two years,,trying to change how we feed kids in America.,And that's what I want to talk to you a little bit about today.,These are some of my kids with a salad bar.,I put salad bars in all of our schools when I got there.,Everyone says it couldn't be done.,Little kids couldn't eat off the salad bar,,big kids would spit in it -- neither happened. 
 When I took over this, I tried to really figure out,,like, what my vision would be.,How do we really change children's relationship to food?,And I'll tell you why we need to change it,,but we absolutely have to change it.,And what I came to understand is,,we needed to teach children,the symbiotic relationship,between a healthy planet, healthy food and healthy kids.,And that if we don't do that, the antithesis,,although we've heard otherwise,,is we're really going to become extinct,,because we're feeding our children to death.,That's my premise. 
 We're seeing sick kids get sicker and sicker.,And the reason this is happening, by and large,,is because of our food system,and the way the government commodifies food,,the way the government oversees our food,,the way the USDA puts food on kids' plates,that's unhealthy, and allows unhealthy food into schools.,And by -- tacitly, all of us send our kids,,or grandchildren, or nieces, or nephews, to school,and tell them to learn, you know,,learn what's in those schools.,And when you feed these kids bad food,,that's what they're learning. So that's really what this is all about. 
 The way we got here is because of big agribusiness.,We now live in a country where most of us don't decide,,by and large, what we eat. We see big businesses, Monsanto and DuPont,,who brought out Agent Orange and stain-resistant carpet.,They control 90 percent of the commercially produced seeds in our country.,These are -- 10 companies,control much of what's in our grocery stores,,much of what people eat. And that's really, really a problem. 
 So when I started thinking about these issues,and how I was going to change what kids ate,,I really started focusing on what we would teach them.,And the very first thing,was about regional food -- trying to eat food,from within our region.,And clearly, with what's going on with fossil fuel usage,,or when -- as the fossil fuel is going away,,as oil hits its peak oil,,you know, we really have to start thinking about whether or not,we should, or could, be moving food,1,500 miles before we eat it.,So we talked to kids about that,,and we really start to feed kids regional food. 
 And then we talk about organic food.,Now, most school districts can't really afford organic food,,but we, as a nation,,have to start thinking about,consuming, growing and feeding our children,food that's not chock-full of chemicals.,We can't keep feeding our kids pesticides,and herbicides and antibiotics and hormones.,We can't keep doing that.,You know, it doesn't work.,And the results of that are kids getting sick. 
 One of my big soapboxes right now is antibiotics.,Seventy percent of all antibiotics consumed in America,is consumed in animal husbandry.,We are feeding our kids antibiotics,in beef and other animal protein every day.,Seventy percent -- it's unbelievable.,And the result of it is, we have diseases.,We have things like E. coli that we can't fix,,that we can't make kids better when they get sick.,And, you know, certainly antibiotics have been over-prescribed,,but it's an issue in the food supply.,One of my favorite facts is that,U.S. agriculture uses 1.2 billion pounds of pesticides every year.,That means every one of us, and our children,,consumes what would equal a five-pound bag --,those bags you have at home. If I had one here,and ripped it open,,and that pile I would have on the floor,is what we consume and feed our children every year,because of what goes into our food supply,,because of the way we consume,produce in America. 
 The USDA allows these antibiotics,,these hormones and these pesticides in our food supply,,and the USDA paid for this ad,in Time magazine.,Okay, we could talk about Rachel Carson and DDT,,but we know it wasn't good for you and me.,And that is what the USDA allows in our food supply.,And that has to change, you know.,The USDA cannot be seen as,the be-all and end-all of what we feed,our kids and what's allowed.,We cannot believe that they have our best interests at heart.,The antithesis of this whole thing is sustainable food.,That's what I really try and get people to understand.,I really try and teach it to kids. I think it's the most important.,It's consuming food in a way,in which we'll still have a planet,,in which kids will grow up to be healthy,,and which really tries to mitigate,all the negative impacts we're seeing.,It really is just a new idea.,I mean, people toss around sustainability,,but we have to figure out what sustainability is. 
 In less than 200 years, you know, just in a few generations,,we've gone from being 200 --,being 100 percent, 95 percent farmers,to less than 2 percent of farmers.,We now live in a country that has more prisoners than farmers --,2.1 million prisoners, 1.9 million farmers.,And we spend 35,000 dollars,on average a year keeping a prisoner in prison,,and school districts spend 500 dollars a year,feeding a child.,It's no wonder, you know, we have criminals. 
 (Laughter) 
 And what's happening is, we're getting sick.,We're getting sick and our kids are getting sick.,It is about what we feed them.,What goes in is what we are.,We really are what we eat.,And if we continue down this path,,if we continue to feed kids bad food,,if we continue not to teach them what good food is,,what's going to happen? You know, what is going to happen?,What's going to happen to our whole medical system?,What's going to happen is,,we're going to have kids,that have a life less long than our own.,The CDC, the Center for Disease Control,,has said, of the children born in the year 2000 --,those seven- and eight-year-olds today --,one out of every three Caucasians,,one out of every two African-Americans and Hispanics,are going to have diabetes in their lifetime.,And if that's not enough, they've gone on to say,,most before they graduate high school.,This means that 40 or 45 percent,of all school-aged children,could be insulin-dependent,within a decade. Within a decade. 
 What's going to happen?,Well, the CDC has gone further to say,that those children born in the year 2000,could be the first generation,in our country's history to die at a younger age than their parents.,And it's because of what we feed them.,Because eight-year-olds don't get to decide --,and if they do, you should be in therapy.,You know, we are responsible,for what kids eat.,But oops, maybe they're responsible for what kids eat.,Big companies spend 20 billion dollars a year,marketing non-nutrient foods to kids.,20 billion dollars a year. 10,000 ads most kids see.,They spend 500 dollars,for every one dollar -- 500 dollars marketing foods,that kids shouldn't eat for every one dollar,marketing healthy, nutritious food.,The result of which is kids think they're going to die,if they don't have chicken nuggets. 
 You know that everybody thinks they should be eating more, and more, and more.,This is the USDA portion size, that little, tiny thing.,And the one over there, that's bigger than my head,,is what McDonald's and Burger King,and those big companies think we should eat.,And why can they serve that much?,Why can we have 29-cent Big Gulps,and 99-cent double burgers?,It's because of the way the government commodifies food,,and the cheap corn and cheap soy,that are pushed into our food supply,that makes these non-nutrient foods,really, really cheap.,Which is why I say it's a social justice issue. 
 Now, I said I'm doing this in Berkeley, and you might think,,"Oh, Berkeley. Of course you can do it in Berkeley.",Well, this is the food I found 24 months ago.,This is not even food.,This is the stuff we were feeding our kids: Extremo Burritos,,corn dogs,,pizza pockets, grilled cheese sandwiches.,Everything came in plastic, in cardboard.,The only kitchen tools my staff had was a box cutter.,The only working piece of equipment in my kitchen,was a can crusher, because if it didn't come in a can,,it came frozen in a box.,The USDA allows this.,The USDA allows all of this stuff.,In case you can't tell, that's, like,,pink Danish and some kind of cupcakes.,Chicken nuggets, Tater Tots, chocolate milk with high fructose,,canned fruit cocktail -- a reimbursable meal. 
 That's what the government says is okay to feed our kids.,It ain't okay. You know what? It is not okay.,And we, all of us,,have to understand,that this is about us,,that we can make a difference here.,Now I don't know if any of you out there invented chicken nuggets,,but I'm sure you're rich if you did.,But whoever decided that a chicken should look like,a heart, a giraffe, a star?,Well, Tyson did, because there's no chicken in the chicken.,And that they could figure it out,,that we could sell this stuff to kids.,You know, what's wrong with teaching kids,that chicken looks like chicken?,But this is what most schools serve.,In fact, this may be what a lot of parents serve,,as opposed to -- this is what we try and serve. 
 We really need to change,this whole paradigm with kids and food.,We really have to teach children,that chicken is not a giraffe.,You know, that vegetables,are actually colorful, that they have flavor,,that carrots grow in the ground,,that strawberries grow in the ground.,There's not a strawberry tree or a carrot bush.,You know, we have to change,the way we teach kids about these things.,There's a lot of stuff we can do. There's a lot of schools,doing farm-to-school programs. There's a lot of schools,actually getting fresh food into schools. 
 Now, in Berkeley, we've gone totally fresh.,We have no high-fructose corn syrup,,no trans fats, no processed foods.,We're cooking from scratch every day.,We have 25 percent of our --,(Applause),thank you -- 25 percent of our stuff,is organic and local. We cook.,Those are my hands. I get up at 4 a.m.,every day and go cook the food for the kids,,because this is what we need to do.,We can't keep serving kids,processed crap,,full of chemicals,,and expect these are going to be healthy citizens.,You're not going to get the next generation,,or the generation after, to be able to think like this,if they're not nourished.,If they're eating,chemicals all the time,,they're not going to be able to think.,They're not going to be smart.,You know what? They're just going to be sick. 
 Now one of the things that -- what happened when I went into Berkeley,is I realized that, you know, this was all pretty amazing to people,,very, very different, and I needed to market it.,I came up with these calendars that I sent home to every parent.,And these calendars really started to lay out my program.,Now I'm in charge of all the cooking classes,and all the gardening classes in our school district.,So this is a typical menu.,This is what we're serving this week at the schools.,And you see these recipes on the side?,Those are the recipes that the kids learn in my cooking classes.,They do tastings of these ingredients in the gardening classes.,They also may be growing them. And we serve them in the cafeterias.,If we're going to change children's relationship to food,,it's delicious, nutritious food in the cafeterias,,hands-on experience -- you're looking in cooking and gardening classes --,and academic curriculum to tie it all together. 
 Now you've probably garnered that I don't love the USDA,,and I don't have any idea what to do with their pyramid,,this upside-down pyramid with a rainbow over the top, I don't know.,You know, run up into the end of the rainbow,,I don't know what you do with it. So, I came up with my own.,This is available on my website in English and Spanish,,and it's a visual way to talk to kids about food.,The really tiny hamburger, the really big vegetables.,We have to start changing this.,We have to make kids understand,that their food choices make a big difference.,We have cooking classes -- we have cooking classrooms in our schools.,And why this is so important is,that we now have grown a generation,,maybe two, of kids where one out of every four meals,is eaten in fast food, one of every four meals is eaten in a car,and one out of every last four meals is eaten in front of a TV or computer.,What are kids learning? Where is the family time?,Where is socialization? Where is discussion?,Where is learning to talk?,You know, we have to change it. 
 I work with kids a lot. These are kids I work with in Harlem.,EATWISE -- Enlightened and Aware Teens Who Inspire Smart Eating.,We have to teach kids,that Coke and Pop Tarts,aren't breakfast.,We have to teach kids that if they're on a diet,of refined sugar,,they go up and down, just like if they're on a diet of crack.,And we have to pull it all together. We have composting in all of our schools.,We have recycling in all of our schools.,You know, the things that we maybe do at home,and think are so important,,we have to teach kids about in school.,It has to be so much a part of them,that they really get it.,Because, you know what, many of us,are sort of at the end of our careers,,and we need to be giving these kids --,these young kids, the next generation --,the tools to save themselves,and save the planet. 
 One of the things I do a lot is public-private partnerships.,I work with private companies,who are willing to do R & D with me,,who are willing to do distribution for me,,who are really willing to work to go into schools.,Schools are underfunded.,Most schools in America spend less,than 7,500 dollars a year teaching a child.,That comes down to under five dollars an hour.,Most of you spend 10, 15 dollars an hour,for babysitters when you have them.,So we're spending less than 5 dollars an hour on the educational system.,And if we're going to change it,,and change how we feed kids,,we really have to rethink that.,So, public and private partnerships,,advocacy groups, working with foundations.,In our school district, the way we afford this,is our school district allocates .03 percent,of the general fund,towards nutrition services. And I think if every school district,allocated a half to one percent,,we could start to really fix this program. 
 We really need to change it.,It's going to take more money.,Of course, it's not all about food; it's also about,kids getting exercise.,And one of the simple things we can do,is put recess before lunch.,It's sort of this "duh" thing.,You know, if you have kids coming into lunch,and all they're going to do when they get out of lunch is go to have recess,,you see them just throw away their lunch so they can run outside.,And then, at one in the afternoon, they're totally crashing.,These are your children and grandchildren that are totally melting down,when you pick them up, because they haven't had lunch.,So if the only thing they'd have to do after lunch is go to class,,believe me, they're going to sit there and eat their lunch. 
 We need to --,we need to educate.,We need to educate the kids.,We need to educate the staff.,I had 90 employees.,Two were supposed to be cooks -- none could.,And, you know, I'm not that better off now.,But we really have to educate.,We have to get academic institutions to start thinking,about ways to teach people how to cook again,,because, of course, they don't --,because we've had this processed food in schools,and institutions for so long.,We need 40-minute lunches --,most schools have 20-minute lunches --,and lunches that are time-appropriate.,There was just a big study done, and so many schools,are starting lunch at nine and 10 in the morning.,That is not lunchtime. 
 You know, it's crazy. It's crazy what we're doing.,And just remember,,at very least tacitly,,this is what we're teaching children,as what they should be doing.,I think if we're going to fix this,,one of the things we have to do,is really change how we have oversight,over the National School Lunch Program.,Instead of the National School Lunch Program being under the USDA,,I think it should be under CDC.,If we started to think about food,and how we feed our kids,as a health initiative,,and we started thinking about food as health,,then I think we wouldn't have corn dogs,as lunch. 
 Okay, Finance 101 on this,,and this -- I'm sort of wrapping it up with this finance piece,,because I think this is something we all have to understand.,The National School Lunch Program spends 8 billion dollars,feeding 30 million children a year.,That number probably needs to double.,People say, "Oh my God, where are we going to get 8 billion?",In this country, we're spending 110 billion dollars a year,on fast food.,We spend 100 billion dollars a year,on diet aids.,We spend 50 billion dollars on vegetables,,which is why we need all the diet aids.,We spend 200 billion dollars a year,on diet-related illness today,,with nine percent of our kids having type 2 diabetes.,200 billion. 
 So you know what, when we talk,about needing 8 billion more, it's not a lot.,That 8 billion comes down to two dollars and 49 cents --,that's what the government allocates for lunch.,Most school districts spend two thirds of that on payroll and overhead.,That means we spend less than a dollar a day,on food for kids in schools --,most schools, 80 to 90 cents. In L.A., it's 56 cents.,So we're spending less than a dollar, OK, on lunch.,Now I don't know about you,,but I go to Starbucks and Pete's and places like that,,and venti latte in San Francisco is five dollars.,One gourmet coffee,,one, is more --,we spend more on than we are spending to feed kids,for an entire week,in our schools. 
 You know what? We should be ashamed.,We, as a country, should be ashamed,at that.,The richest country.,In our country,,it's the kids that need it the most,,who get this really, really lousy food.,It's the kids who have parents and grandparents,and uncles and aunts that can't even afford,to pay for school lunch that gets this food.,And those are the same kids,who are going to be getting sick.,Those are the same kids who we should be taking care of. 
 We can all make a difference.,That every single one of us,,whether we have children,,whether we care about children, whether we have nieces or nephews,,or anything --,that we can make a difference.,Whether you sit down and eat a meal with your kids,,whether you take your kids, or grandchildren,,or nieces and nephews shopping,to a farmers' market. Just do tastings with them.,Sit down and care.,And on the macro level,,we're in what seems to be,a 19-month presidential campaign,,and of all the things we're asking,all of these potential leaders,,what about asking for the health of our children?,Thank you.We really need to put the best we have to offer within reach of our children.,If we don't do that, we're going to get the generation we deserve.,They're going to learn from whatever it is they have around them. 
 And we, as now the elite, parents, librarians, professionals, whatever it is,,a bunch of our activities are, in fact, in trying to get the best we have to offer,within reach of those around us, or as broadly as we can.,I'm going to start and end this talk with a couple things that are carved in stone.,One is what's on the Boston Public Library.,Carved above their door is, "Free to All.",It's kind of an inspiring statement,,and I'll go back at the end of this.,I'm a librarian, and what I'm trying to do is bring all of the works of knowledge,to as many people as want to read it.,And the idea of using technology is perfect for us.,I think we have the opportunity to one-up the Greeks.,It's not easy to one-up the Greeks. But with the industriousness of the Egyptians,,they were able to build the Library of Alexandria --,the idea of a copy of every book of all the peoples of the world.,The problem was you actually had to go to Alexandria to go to it.,On the other hand, if you did, then great things happened.,I think we can one-up the Greeks and achieve something.,And I'm going to try to argue only one point today:,that universal access to all knowledge is within our grasp.,So if I'm successful, then you'll actually come away thinking,,yeah, we could actually achieve the great vision of everything ever published,,everything that was ever meant for distribution,,available to anybody in the world that's ever wanted to have access to it. 
 Yes, there's issues about how money should be distributed,,and that's still being refigured out.,But I'd say there's plenty of money, and there's plenty of demand,,so we can actually achieve that.,But I'm going to go over the technological, social,and sort of where are we as a whole, trying to get to that particular vision.,And the way I'm going to try to do this is do it like the Amazon.com website,,the books, music, video and just go step -- media type by media type,,just go and say, all right, how're we doing on this? 
 So if we start with books, you know, sort of where are we?,Well, first you have to, as an engineer, scope the problem. How big is it?,If you wanted to put all of the published works online,so that anybody could have it available, well, how big a problem is it?,Well, we don't really know, but the largest print library in the world,is the Library of Congress. It's 26 million volumes, 26 million volumes.,It is, by far and away, the largest print library in the world.,And a book, if you had a book, is about a megabyte,,so -- you know, if you had it in Microsoft Word.,So a megabyte, 26 million megabytes is 26 terabytes --,it goes mega-, giga-, tera-. 26 terabytes.,26 terabytes fits in a computer system that's about this big,,on spinning Linux drives, and it costs about 60,000 dollars.,So for the cost of a house -- or around here, a garage --,you can put, you can have spinning all of the words in the Library of Congress.,That's pretty neat. 
 Then the question is, what do you get?,You know, is it worth trying to get there?,Do you actually want it online?,Some of the first things that people do is they make book readers,that allow you to search inside the books, and that's kind of fun.,And you can download these things, and look around them in new and different ways.,And you can get at them remotely, if you happen to have a laptop.,There's starting to be some of these sort of page turn-y interfaces,that look a whole lot like books in certain ways,,and you can search them, make little tabs, and it's kind of cute --,still very book-like -- on your laptop.,But I don't know, reading things on a laptop --,whenever I pull up my laptop, it always feels like work.,I think that's one of the reasons why the Kindle is so great.,I don't have to feel like I'm at work to read a Kindle.,It's starting to be a little bit more specified.,But I have to say that there's older technologies that I tend to like.,I like the physical book.,And I think we can go and use our technology to go and digitize things,,put them on the Net, and then download,,print them and bind them, and end up with books again. 
 And we sort of said, well, how hard is this?,And it turns out to not be very hard.,We actually went off to make a bookmobile.,And a bookmobile -- the size of a van with a satellite dish,,a printer, binder and cutter, and kids make their own books.,It costs about three dollars to download, print and bind a normal, old book.,And they actually come out kind of nice looking.,You can actually get really good-looking books,for on the order of one penny per page, sort of the parts cost for doing this. 
 So the idea of -- this technology actually may end up,putting books back in people's hands again.,There are some other bookmobiles running around.,This is Eric Eldred making books at Walden Pond -- Thoreau's works.,This is just before he got kicked out by the Parks Services,,for competing with the bookstore there.,In India, they've got another couple bookmobiles running around.,And this is the opening day at the Library of Alexandria,,the new Library of Alexandria, in Egypt.,It was quite popularly attended.,And kids starting to make their own books,,and a happy kid with the first book that he's ever owned.,So the idea of being able to use this technology,to end up with paper where I can handle sort of sounds a little retro,,but I think it still has its place.,And being from the Silicon Valley, sort of utopian,sort of world,,we thought, if we can make this technology work in rural Uganda,,we might have something.,So we actually got some funding from the World Bank to try it out.,And we found in about 30 days we could go and take a couple folks from Silicon Valley,,fly them to Uganda, buy a car, set up the first Internet connection,at the National Library of Uganda, figure out what they wanted,,and get a program going making books in rural Uganda.,And it actually -- so technologically, it works. 
 What we found out of this is we didn't have the right books.,So the books were in the library. We could get it to people, if they're digitized,,but we didn't know how to quite get them digitized.,Everybody thought the answer is, send things to India and China.,And so we've tried that, and I'll go over that in a moment.,There are some newer technologies for delivering,that have happened that are actually quite exciting as well.,One is a print-on-demand machine that looks like a Rube Goldberg machine.,We have one of these things now. It's completely cool.,It's all conveyor belt, and it makes a book.,And it's called the "Espresso Book Machine,",and in about 10 minutes, you can press a button and make a book. 
 Something else I'm quite excited about in this particular domain,,beyond these sort of kiosk-y things where you can get books on demand,,is some of these new little screens that are coming out.,And one of my favorites in this is the $100 laptop.,And I don't mean to steal any thunder here,,but we've gone and used one of these things to be an e-book reader.,So here's one of the beta units and you can --,it actually turns out to be a really good-looking e-book reader.,And we have a quick hack that we did to try to put one of our books on it,,and it turns out that 200 dots per inch,means that you can put scanned books on them that look really good.,At 200 dots per inch, it's kind of the equivalent of a 300 dot print laser printer.,We're in good enough shape.,You actually can go and read scanned books quite easily. 
 So the idea of electronic books is starting to come about.,But how do you go about doing all this scanning?,So we thought, okay, well, let's try out this send books to India thing.,And there was a project with, funded by the National Science Foundation --,sent a bunch of scanners, and the American libraries were supposed to send books.,Well, they didn't. They didn't want to send their books.,So we bought 100,000 books and sent them to India.,And then we learned why you don't want to send books to India.,The lesson we learned out of this is, scan your own books.,If you really care about books, you're going to scan them better,,especially if they're valuable books.,If they're new books and you can just, you know, butcher them,,because you could just buy another one,,that's not such a big deal in terms of doing high-quality scanning.,But do things that you love.,But the Indians have been scanning a lot of their own books --,about 300,000 now -- doing very well.,The Chinese did over a million, and the Egyptians are about 30,000. 
 But we sent -- thought, OK, if we're going to need to do this, let's do it in-library.,How do we go and do this, and how do we get it down,so that it's a cost point that we could afford?,And we sort of picked the price point of 10 cents a page.,If it's basically the cost of xeroxing to basically digitize, OCR, package it up,,make it so that you could download, print and bind it -- the whole shebang --,we would have achieved something.,So we started out trying to figure out. How do we get to 10 cents?,And we tried these robot things, and they worked pretty well --,sort of these auto-page-turning things.,If we can have Mars Rovers, you'd think you could turn pages.,But it actually turns out to be pretty hard to turn pages, and the volume isn't there.,So anyway -- so we ended up making our own book scanner,,and with two digital, high-grade, professional digital cameras,,controlled museum lighting, so even if it's a black and white book,,you can go and get the proper intonation.,So you basically do a beautiful, respectful job.,This is not a fax, this is -- the idea is to do a beautiful job,as you're going through these libraries.,And we've been able to achieve 10 cents a page if we run things in volume.,This is what it looks like at the University of Toronto.,And actually, it turns out to, you know, pay a living wage.,People seem to love it.,Yes, it's a little boring, but some people kind of get into the Zen of it.,(Laughter),And especially if it's kind of interesting books that you care about,,in languages that you can read.,We actually have been able to do a pretty good job of this, at getting 10 cents a page.,So 10 cents a page, 300 pages in your average book, 30 dollars a book.,The Library of Congress, if you did the whole darn thing --,26 million books -- is about 750 million dollars, right?,But a million books, I think, actually would be a pretty good start,,and that would cost 30 million dollars. That's not that big a bill. 
 And what we've been able to do is get into libraries.,We've now got eight of these scanning centers in three countries,,and libraries are up for having their books scanned.,The Getty here is moving their books to the UCLA,,which is where we have one these scanning centers,,and scanning their out-of-copyright books, which is fabulous.,So we're starting to get the institutional responsibility.,The thing we're missing is the 10 cents.,If we can get the 10 cents, all the rest of it flows.,We've scanned about 200,000 books.,Now we're scanning about 15,000 books a month,,and it's starting to gear up another factor of two from there. 
 So all in all, that's going very well.,And we're starting to move out of the just out-of-copyright,into the out-of-print world.,So I think of -- we're kind of going from the out-of-copyright, library stuff,,and Amazon.com is coming from the in-print world.,And I think we'll meet in the middle some place,,and have the classic thing that you have,,which is a publishing system and a library system working in parallel.,And so we're starting up a program to do out-of-print works, but loaning them.,Exactly what loaning means, I'm not quite sure.,But anyway, loaning out-of-print works from the Boston Public Library,,the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and a few other libraries,that are starting to participate in this program,,to try out this model of where does a library stop,and where does the bookstore take over.,So all in all, it's possible to do this in large scale.,We're also going back over microfilm and getting that online.,So, we can do 10 cents a page, we're going 15,000 books a month,and we've got about 250,000 books online,,counting all the other projects that are starting to add in.,So what I wanted to argue is, books are within our grasp.,The idea of taking on the whole ball of wax is not that big a deal.,Yes, it costs tens of millions, low hundreds of millions,,but one time shot and we've got basically the history of printed literature online.,And then, there's business model issues,about how to try to effectively market it and get it to people.,But it is within our grasp, technologically and law-wise,,at least for the out of print and out of copyright,,we suggest, to be able to get the whole darn thing online. 
 Now let's go for audio, and I'm going to go through these.,So how much is there?,Well, as best we can tell, there are about two to three million disks,having been published -- so 78s, long-playing records and CDs --,or at least that's the largest archives of published materials,we've been able to sort of point at.,It costs about 10 dollars a piece to go and take a disk,and put it online, if you're doing things in volume.,But we've found that the rights issues are really quite thorny.,This is a fairly heavily litigated area,,so we've found that there are niches in the music world,that aren't served terribly well by the classic commercial publishing system.,And we've been starting to make these available by going,and offering shelf space on the Net.,In the United States, it doesn't cost you to give something away. Right?,If you give something to a charity or to the public,,you get a pat on the back and a tax donation --,except on the Net, where you can go broke.,If you put up a video of your garage band, and it starts getting heavily accessed,,you can lose your guitars or your house. 
 This doesn't make any sense.,So we've offered unlimited storage, unlimited bandwidth, forever, for free,,to anybody that has something to share that belongs in a library.,And we've been getting a lot of takers. One is the rock 'n' rollers.,The rock 'n' rollers had a tradition of sharing,,as long as nobody made any money. You could --,concert recordings, it's not the commercial recordings,,but concert recordings, started by the Grateful Dead.,And we get about two or three bands a day signing up.,They give permission, and we get about 40 or 50 concerts a day.,We have about 40,000 concerts, everything the Grateful Dead ever did,,up on the Net, so that people can see it and listen to this material.,So audio is possible to put up, but the rights issues are really pretty thorny.,We've got a lot of collections now --,a couple hundred thousand items -- and it's growing over time. 
 Moving images: if you think of theatrical releases,,there are not that many of them.,As best we can tell, there are about 150,000 to 200,000 movies ever,that are really meant for a large-scale theatrical distribution. It's just not that many.,But half of those were Indian.,But anyway, it's doable,,but we've only found about a thousand of these things that --,to be out of copyright.,So we've digitized those and made those available.,But we've found that there's lots of other types of movies,that haven't really seen the light of day -- archival films.,We've found, also, a lot of political films, a lot of amateur films,,all sorts of things that are basically needing a home, a permanent home.,So we've been starting to make these available and it's grown to be very popular.,We're not quite a YouTube.,We tended towards longer-term things,and also things that people can reuse and make into new movies,,which has just been great fun. 
 Television comes quite a bit larger.,We started recording 20 channels of television 24 hours a day.,It's sort of the biggest TiVo box you've ever seen.,It's about a petabyte, so far, of worldwide television --,Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Iraqi, Al Jazeera, BBC, CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC --,24 hours a day.,We only put one week up,,which is mostly for cost reasons, which is the 9/11,,sort of from 9/11/2001. For one week, what did the world see?,CNN was saying that Palestinians were dancing in the streets.,Were they? Let's look at the Palestinian television and find out.,How can we have critical thinking without being able to quote,and being able to compare what happened in the past?,And television is dreadfully unrecorded and unquotable,,except by Jon Stewart, who does a fabulous job.,So anyway, television is, I would suggest, within our grasp.,So 15 dollars per video hour, and also about 100 dollars to 150 dollars per celluloid hour,,we're able to go and get materials online very inexpensively,and have them up on the Net.,And we've got, now, a lot of these materials.,So we've got about 100,000 pieces up there.,So books, music, video, software. There's only 50,000 titles of it.,Mostly the issues there are legal issues and breaking copy protections.,But we've worked through some of those,,but we've still got real problems in Washington. 
 Well, we're best known as the World Wide Web.,We've been archiving the World Wide Web since 1996.,We take a snapshot of every website and all of the pages on it, every two months.,And actually, it's really been pioneered by Alexa Internet,,which donates this collection to the Internet Archive.,And it's been growing along for the last 11 years, and it's a fantastic resource.,And we've made a Wayback Machine,that you can then go and see old websites kind of the way they were.,If you go and search on something -- this is Google.com,,the different versions of it that we have,,this is what it looks like when it was an alpha release,,and this is what it looked like at Stanford.,So anyway, you've got basically an idea of where things came from.,Mostly, people want to see their old stuff out of this.,If there's one thing that we want to learn from the Library of Alexandria version one,,which is probably best known for burning,,is, don't just have one copy.,So we've started to -- we've made another copy of all of this,and we actually put it back in the Library of Alexandria.,So this is a picture of the Internet Archive at the Library of Alexandria.,And we now have also another copy building up in Amsterdam.,So, we should put it in the San Andreas Fault Line in San Francisco,,flood zone in Amsterdam and in the Middle East. Right, so anyway ...,so we're hedging our bets here.,If we go and put it in a couple more places, I think we'll be in good shape. 
 There's a political and social question out of this.,Is all of this, as we go digital, is it going to be public or private?,There's some large companies that have seen this vision,,that are doing large-scale digitization,,but they're locking up the public domain.,The question is, is that the world that we really want to live in?,What's the role of the public versus the private as things go forward?,How do we go and have a world where we both have libraries,and publishing in the future, just as we basically benefited as we were growing up?,So universal access to all knowledge --,I think it can be one of the greatest achievements of humankind,,like the man on the moon, or the Gutenberg Bible, or the Library of Alexandria.,It could be something that we're remembered for,,for millennia, for having achieved.,And as I said before, I'll end with something,that's carved above the door of the Carnegie Library.,Carnegie -- one of the great capitalists of this country --,carved above his legacy, "Free to the People.",Thank you very much.I'm a, or was, or kind of am a toy designer.,And before I was a toy designer, oh, I was a mime, a street mime, actually.,And then I was an entertainer, I guess.,And before that, I was a silversmith, and before that, I was --,I was out of the house at about 15 and a half,,and I never wound up going into college.,I didn't really -- I didn't see the point at the time.,I do now, after learning about all the quantum stuff. 
 (Laughter),It's really cool. 
 Anyway, I wanted to show you a little bit about the world of toy design,,at least from my small aperture of the world.,This is a video I made when I first started doing toy design.,I'm in my garage, making weird stuff.,And then you go to these toy companies,and there's some guy across the table,,and he goes, "Pass. Pass. Pass.",You know, you think it's so cool, but they --,anyway, I made this little tape that I'd always show when I go in.,This is the name of my company, Giving Toys.,So I used to work at Mattel, actually.,And after I left Mattel, I started all these hamburger makers,,and then got the license to make the maker.,So this is a hamburger maker that,you take the peanut butter and stuff and you put it in there, and it makes --,and this is a French fry maker, little, tiny food you can eat.,I beat up the pasta maker to make that.,Then this is a McNugget maker, I think.,This, now that's the McNugget maker,,and this is a -- this is my oldest daughter making a McApple Pie.,And let's see, you can make the pie and cinnamon and sugar,,and then you eat, and you eat, and you eat, and you --,she's about 300 pounds now.,No, she's not, she's beautiful.,This is how they looked when they came out at the end.,These are a -- this is like a 15 million dollar line.,And it got me through some -- I didn't make any royalties on this, but it got me through. 
 Next is a compilation of a bunch of stuff.,That was a missile foam launcher that didn't get sold.,This is a squishy head, for no apparent reason.,This is some effects that I did for "Wig, Rattle and Roll.",That was a robot eye thing controlling it in the back.,That paid the rent for about a month.,This is a walking Barbie -- I said, "Oh, this is it!",And they go, "Oh, that's really nice," and out it goes.,So this is some fighting robots. I thought everyone would want these.,They fight, they get back up, you know? Wouldn't this be cool?,And they made it into a toy, and then they dropped it like a hot rock.,They're pretty cool.,This is a-- we're doing some flight-testing,on my little pug, seeing if this can really grab.,It does pretty good.,I'm using little phone connectors to make them so they can spin.,It's how they, see, have those album things -- kids don't know what they are.,This is a clay maker.,You know, I said -- I went to Play-Doh,,and said, "Look, I can animate this.",They said, "Don't talk to us about Play-Doh.",And then, I made a Lego animator.,I thought, this would be so great!,And you know, Lego -- don't take Legos to Lego.,That's the answer. They know everything about it. 
 Then I started doing animatronics.,I loved dinosaurs.,I used to be in the film business, kind of,,and actually, Nicholas Negroponte saw this when I was, like, 12,,and anyway, so then they said, "No, you have to make two and they have to fight.",You know, how -- why would a kid want a dinosaur?,This is me using [unclear] or 3-D Studio, back in the '80s.,That's David Letterman.,You can see how old this stuff is.,That's my youngest cousin.,This is a segment called, "Dangerous Toys You Won't See at Christmas.",We had my first saw blade launcher and we had a flamethrower chair.,My career basically peaked here.,And in the back are foam-core cutouts of the people who couldn't make it to the show.,This is MEK going through a windshield wiper motor.,So this is a -- I used to kind of be an actor.,And I'm really not very good at it.,But the -- this is a guy named Dr. Yatz,,who would take toys apart and show kids about engineering.,And you can see the massively parallel processing Nintendos there.,And over to the left is a view master of the CD-ROM.,And a guy named Stan Reznikov did this as a pilot.,This is a -- you can see the little window there.,You can actually see the Steadicam with a bubble on the bottom.,You see the keyboard strapped to my wrist.,Way ahead of my time here. 
 (Video) I'm getting dizzy ...,Narrator: I love toys! 
 Caleb Chung: That's all I wanted to say there. I love toys.,OK, so, so that was a, that was the first kind of a --,that was the first batch of products.,Most of them did not go.,You get one out of 20, one out of 30 products.,And every now and then, we do something like a,,you know, an automated hair wrap machine, you know,,that tangles your hair and pulls your scalp out, and --,and we'd make some money on that, you know. And we'd give it out.,But eventually, we left L.A., and we moved to Idaho,,where there was actually a lot of peace and quiet.,And I started working on this project,-- oh, I have to tell you about this real quick.,Throughout this whole thing, making toys,,I think there is a real correlation with innovation and art and science.,There's some kind of a blend that happens,that allows, you know, to find innovation.,And I tried to sum this up in some kind of symbol,that means something, to me anyway.,And so, art and science have a kind of dynamic balance,,that's where I think innovation happens.,And actually, this is, to me, how I can come up with great ideas.,But it's not how you actually get leverage.,Actually, you have to put a circle around that, and call it business.,And those three together, I think, give you leverage in the world.,But moving on.,So, this is a quick tale I'm going to tell. This is the Furby tale.,As he said, I was co-inventor of the Furby.,I did the body and creature -- well, you'll see.,So by way of showing you this, you can kind of,get an understanding of what it is to,,hopefully, try to create robotic life forms, or technology,that has an emotional connection with the user.,So this is my family.,This is my wife, Christi, and Abby, and Melissa,,and my 17-year-old now, Emily, who was just a pack of trouble.,All right, there's that robot again.,I came out of the movie business, as I said,,and I said, let's make these animatronic robots.,Let's make these things.,And so I've always had a big interest in this.,This one actually didn't go anywhere,,but I got my feet wet doing this.,This is a smaller one, and I have a little moving torso on there.,A little, tiny guy walks along. More servo drives,,lots of servo hacking, lots of mechanical stuff.,There's another one.,He actually has skeletor legs, I think, he's wearing there.,Oh, this is a little pony, little pony -- very cute little thing. 
 The point of showing these is I've always been interested in little artificial life pieces.,So the challenge was -- I worked for Microsoft for a little bit,,working on the Microsoft Barney.,And this is a -- you know, the purple dinosaur with kind of bloat wear.,And, you know, they had lots, just lots of stuff in there that you didn't need, I thought.,And then Microsoft can just fill a, you know, a warehouse,full of this stuff and see if they sell.,So it's a really strange business model compared to coming from a toy company.,But anyway, a friend of mine and I, Dave Hampton,,decided to see if we could do like a single-cell organism.,What's the fewest pieces we could use to make a little life form?,And that's our little, thirty-cent Mabuchi motor.,And so, I have all these design books,,like I'm sure many of you have.,And throughout the books -- this is the first page on Furby --,I have kind of the art and science.,I have the why over here, and the how over there.,I try to do a lot of philosophy, a lot of thinking about all of these projects.,Because they're not just "bing" ideas;,you have to really dig deep in these things.,So there's some real pseudo-code over here,,and getting the idea of different kind of drives, things like that.,And originally, Furby only had two eyes and some batteries on the bottom.,And then we said, well, you're going to feed him,,and he needs to talk, and it got more complicated.,And then I had to figure out how I'm going to use that one motor,to make the eyes move, and the ears move,,and the body to move, and the mouth to move.,And, you know, I want to make it blink,and do all that at the same time.,Well, I came up with this kind of linear,expression thing with these cams and feedback. And that worked pretty well.,Then I started to get a little more realistic,and I have to start drawing the stuff.,And there's my "note to self" at the top:,"lots of engineering.",So that turned out to be a little more than true.,There's my first exploded view and all the little pieces,and the little worm drive and all that stuff.,And then I've got to start building it,,so this is the real thing.,I get up and start cutting my finger and gluing things together.,And that's my little workshop.,And there's the first little cam that drove Furby.,And there's Furby on the half shell.,You can see the little BB in the box is my tilt sensor.,I just basically gnawed all this stuff out of plastic.,So there's the back of his head with a billion holes in it.,And there I am. I'm done. There's my little Furby.,No, it's a little robot on heroin or something, I think.,(Laughter),So right now, you see, I love little robots.,So my wife says, "Well, you may like it, but nobody else will.",So she comes to the rescue.,This is my wife Christi, who is just, you know,,my muse and my partner for eternity here.,And she does drawings, right?,She's an actual, you know, artist.,And she starts doing all these different drawings,and does color patterns and coloring books.,And I like the guy with the cigar at the bottom there.,He didn't test so well, but I like him.,And then she started doing these other images.,At that time, Beanie Babies was a big hit,,and we thought, we'll do a bunch of different ones.,So here's a little pink one, a little pouf on his head.,And here's -- this didn't do so well in testing either, I don't know why.,There's my favorite, Demon Furby.,That was a good one.,Anyway, finally settled on kind of this kind of a look,,little poufy body, a little imaginary character.,And there he is, a little bush baby on -- caught in the headlights there.,I actually went to Toys"R"Us, got a little furry cat,,ripped it apart and made this.,And since then, every time I come home from Toys"R"Us,with dolls or something, they disappear from my desk,and they get hidden in the house.,I have three girls and they just, they --,it's like a rescue animal thing they're going there.,(Laughter),So, a little tether coming off,,it's just a control for the Fur's mouth and his eyes.,It's just a little server control and I made a little video going:,"Hi, my name's Furby, and I'm good,",you know, and then I'd reach my hand.,He'd -- you can tickle him. When I put my hand up,,"Ha, ha, ha, ha" and that's how we sold him.,And Hasbro actually said, I meant Tiger Electronics at the time,,said, "Yeah, we want to do this.,We have, you know, 13 weeks or something to Toy Fair,,and we're going to hire you guys to do this." 
 And so Dave and I got working.,Mostly me, because it was all mechanics at this point.,So now I have to really figure out all kinds of stuff,I don't know how to do.,And I started working with Solid Works,and a whole other group to do that.,And we started --,this was way back before there was really much SLA going on,,not a lot of rapid prototyping.,We certainly didn't have the money to do this.,They only paid me, like, a little bit of money to do this,,so I had to call a friend of a friend,who was running the GM prototype plant, SLA plant, that was down.,And they said, "Yeah, well, we'll run them.",So they ran all the shells for us, which was nice of them.,And the cams I got cut at Hewlett Packard.,We snuck in on the weekend.,And so we just had a disc of the files.,But they have a closed system, so you couldn't print the things out on the machine.,So we actually printed them out on clear and taped them on the monitors.,And on the weekend we ran the parts for that.,So this is how they come out close to the end.,And then they looked like little Garfields there.,Eight months later -- you may remember this,,this was a -- total, total, total chaos.,For a while, they were making two million Furbys a month.,They actually wound up doing about 40 million Furbys.,I -- it's unbelievable how -- I don't know how that can be.,And Hasbro made about, you know, a billion and a half dollars.,And I just a little bit on each one. 
 So full circle -- why do I do this?,Why do you, you know, try to do this stuff?,And it's, of course, for your kids.,And there's my youngest daughter with her Furbys.,And she still actually has those.,So I kind of retired, and we're already living in paradise,up in Boise, on a river, you know. So,and then I started another company called Toy Innovation,and we did some projects with Mattel with,actually with a lady who's here, Ivy Ross,,and we did Miracle Moves Baby,,made it in Wired magazine, did a bunch of other stuff.,And then I started another company.,We did a little hand-held device for teens that could hook up to the Internet,,won "Best Innovations" at CES,,but really I kind of slowed down and said, OK,,I just ... After a while, I had this old tape of this dinosaur,,and I gave it to this guy, and this other guy saw it,,and then people started to want to do it.,And they said they'd spend all this time.,So I said, "OK, let's try to do this dinosaur project.",The crazy idea is we're going to try to clone a dinosaur,as much as we can with today's technology.,And it's not really -- but as close as we can do.,And we're going to try to really pull this off,,intentfully try to make something that seems like it's alive.,Not a robot that kind of does, but let's really go for it.,So I picked a Camarasaurus,,because the Camarasaurus was the most abundant of the sauropods in North America.,And you could actually find full fossil evidence of these.,That's a juvenile.,And so we actually went in.,There's a book called "Walking on Eggshells,",where they found actual sauropod skin in Patagonia.,And the picture from the book, so when I --,I told the sculptor to use this bump pattern, whatever you can to copy that.,Very, very obsessive.,There's a kind of truncated Camarasaurus skeleton,,but the geometry's correct.,And then I went in, and measured all the geometry,because I figured, hey, biomimicry.,If I do it kind of right, it might move kind of like the real thing.,So there's the motor.,And about this time, you know, all these other people are starting to help.,Here's an example of what we did with the skull.,There's the skull, there's my drawing of a skull.,There's kind of the skin version of the soft tissue.,There's the mechanism that would go in there,,kind of a Geneva drive.,There's some Solid Works versions of it.,Here's some SLA parts of the same thing.,And then, these are really crude pieces. We were just doing some tests here.,There's the skull, pretty much the same shape as the Camarasaurus.,There's a photorealistic eye behind a lens.,And there's kind of the first exploded view, or see-through view.,There's the first SLA version, and it already kind of has the feel,,it has kind of a cuteness already.,And the thing about blending science and art,in this multidisciplinary stuff is you can do a robot,,and then you go back and do the shape,,and then you go back and forth.,The servos in the front legs, we had to shape those like muscles.,They had to fit within the envelope.,There was a tremendous amount of work to get all that working right.,All the neck and the tail are cable,,so it moves smoothly and organically.,And then, of course, you're not done yet.,You have to get the look for the skin.,The skin's a whole another thing, probably the hardest part.,So you hire artists, and you try to get the look and feel,of the character.,Now, this is not -- we're character designers, right?,And we're still trying to keep with the real character.,So, now you go back and you cover the whole thing with clay.,Now you start doing the sculpture for this.,And you can see we got a guy from --,who's just a fanatic about dinosaurs,to do the sculpting for us,,down to the spoon-shaped teeth and everything.,And then more sculpting, and then more sculpting,,and then more sculpting, and then more sculpting.,And then, four years and 10 million dollars later,,we have a little Pleo.,John, do you want to bring him up? 
 John Sosoka is our CTO, and is really the man,that's done most of the work with our 40-person company.,I'd like to give John a hand. He never gets recognition. This is John Sosoka.,(Applause),So, thank you, John, thank you,,and get back to work, all right, man?,All right --,(Laughter),-- no, it's very painful, so --,(Laughter),-- these are little Pleos and you can probably see them.,This -- I on purpose -- they go through life stages.,So when you first get them, they're babies.,And you -- more you have them, kind of the older they get,,and they kind of learn through their behavior.,So this one, this one's actually asleep, and -- hang on.,Pleo, wake up. Pleo, come on.,So this guy's listening to my voice here.,But they have 40 sensors all over their body.,They have seven processors, they have 14 motors,,they have --,but you don't care, do you?,They're just cute, right? That's the idea, that's the idea.,So you see -- hey, come on. Hey, did you feel that?,There's something big and loud over here.,Hey.,(Laughter),That's good, wake up, wake up, wake up.,Yeah, they're like kids, you know.,You, yeah, yeah. Okay, he's hungry.,I'll show you what he's been doing for, for four years.,Here, here, here. Have some money, Pleo.,(Laughter),There you go.,That's what the investors think, that it's just --,(Laughter),-- right, right. So they're really sweet little guys.,And we're hoping that -- you know,,our belief is that humans need to feel empathy towards things,in order to be more human.,And we think we can help that out by having,little creatures that you can love.,Now these are not robots, they're kind of lovebots, you know.,They do change over time.,But mostly they evoke a feeling of caring.,And we have a -- I have a little something here.,Now I do want to say that, you know, Ugobe is not there yet.,We've just opened the door, and it's for all of you to step through it.,We did include some things that are hopefully useful.,Excuse me, Pleo.,They -- he has a USB and he has a SD card,,so it's completely open architecture.,So anyone can plug him -- (Applause) -- thank you.,This is John over here.,Anyone can take Pleo and they can totally redo his personality.,You can make him bipolar, or as someone said, a --,(Laughter) --,you can change his homeostatic drives, or whatever you want to call them.,Kids can just drag and drop, put in new sounds.,We -- actually, it's very hard to keep people from doing this.,We have one animator who's taken it and,he's done a take on the Budweiser beer commercial,,and they're going, "Whassup," you know?,(Laughter),You -- so it's -- yes, he likes that.,So they're a handful. We hope you get one.,I don't know what I'm missing to say,,but as a last thing, I'd like to say is that,if we continue along this path, we are designing our children's best friends.,And there's a lot of social responsibility in that.,That's why Pleo's soft and gentle and loving.,And so I just -- I hope we all dream well.,Thank you.,(Applause)Ninety-nine percent of us have the dream of listeners.,Not being the musicians -- the listeners, right?,And we crave one thing,,even though we kind of don't know it all the time.,We crave to be in the room with the musician,the day it was recorded, the day it was played.,And we go to live concerts, and we get that as much as we can.,But then we listen to the other 99 percent of our stuff recorded.,And it turns out the further back you go in history,,the little rougher it sounds.,And so we said, there's a solution to this.,Let's separate the performance, as a thing,,out from the recording, which was how it was made.,You know, the thing with microphones in the room and all that day.,But the performance itself was how the musicians worked their fingers,,and what instruments they were using.,And it's the data hidden inside the recording.,In order to do this, it's a lot of hardware and software,that runs in a very high resolution.,And Yamaha makes an incredible thing called the Disklavier Pro,that looks like a nice grand piano there.,And you probably didn't realize it's going to do all these things --,but full of solenoids, and fiber optics, and computers,and all this kind of stuff. The highest resolution out of Japan.,And this just didn't work until we could cross this line that says high-definition.,And we were able to cross this line, called the uncanny valley,,in terms of -- artificial intelligence terms.,We have a process where we, you know,,kind of put it into the computer and digitize it, and then a whole lot of analysis.,And we look at every single note,,and all the attributes of those notes:,how hard they were struck, and how they were held down,,and how you move the fingers.,So we had to develop a whole new science of how you move your fingers.,And, you know, it's a thing your piano teacher teaches you,,but we never had a science behind these kinds of things. 
 I'm going to start with Glenn Gould.,He died 25 years ago this year, and was born 75 years ago this year.,Was a beloved pianist, maybe the great cult pianist of the twentieth century.,He just got tired of being in front of an audience,,and felt like -- a performing monkey was, in fact, his term.,So he stepped back, and did nothing but the crafting of his work.,And Gould's specialty was playing Bach.,His maybe most famous recording,was something called "The Goldberg Variations.",Bach only wrote themes and variations one time.,He wrote some early pieces,,but late in his life, in his mature period,,he said, "Here's a theme -- 30 variations.",In fact, the theme isn't even the melody, it's the bass line.,And Gould recorded it in two major recordings that you may know about,,one in mono, and one in stereo.,And the one in mono, by the way, he used the pedal,,and as he got older, he said, "No, no, wait a minute.,I'm going to get very scientific about this, and not use the pedal.",What I'd like you to hear live is the 1955 version,,and we'll play the first couple pieces of it.,Glenn Gould, 1955.,(Music),How about that?,(Applause) 
 So let me tell you a little bit how this was done.,First of all, let me get you to the end step.,This is -- we have a fairly complex process,that, you know, software and musicians and so on,,but when we're all done, we know that the ear is the final arbiter.,We can play the original in one ear, and a new recording in the other.,So I'm going to do this for you right now, what you just heard.,And in the right speaker is going to be the original recording,,and the left speaker is going to be the new recording,,actually of an instrument just like that one,,and I'm going to play them together at the same time.,(Music),That's the original. [Unclear] That's the two together.,(Music) 
 Before "Jurassic Park,",there was no science for how skin hung off of muscle, right?,So, in the video world,,we've been able to invent, in our lifetimes, natural behavior.,And this is kind of another example,of putting a science behind natural behavior.,And then you heard the original.,Ultimately, I started with the experience.,And the experience is: I want to be in the room and hear the musicians.,Lots of you can afford to buy one of these.,But, if not, there is now high-definition surround sound.,And I got to tell you, if you haven't heard high-definition surround,,go down to your audio dealer, your audiophile dealer.,It's so involving compared to regular stereo.,But if you don't have that, maybe you can listen on your headphones.,And so on the same disk we have five recordings --,Sony has five recordings.,And you could listen in headphones,with this thing called binaural recording.,And it's a dummy head that sits in front of the instrument,,and it's got microphones where the ears are.,And when you put on headphones, and you listen to this,,you're inside of Glenn Gould's body.,And it is a chuckle until, you know, the musicians,,who are musicians who play the piano, listen to this, say,,"I can't believe it! It's just what it's like to play the piano.",Except now you're inside Glenn Gould's body playing the piano,,and it feels like your fingers are making the decisions,and moving through the whole process.,It's a game changer. 
 Here's now something we know in spectacular quality.,The whole process is very sensitive to temperature and humidity.,What you heard today was not perfect.,It's an amalgam of wood, and cast iron, and felt,,and steel strings, and all these,,and they're all amazingly sensitive to temperature and humidity.,So when you go into the recording session,,you get to stop after every piece and rebuild the piano if you need to.,There's the whole action there, sitting, kind of, on the side,,and the dummy head and our recording engineers,standing around while we rebuild the piano.,Without putting dates next to these things,,step-by-step music will be turned into data,,like every field that's occurred in the past 35 or 40 years.,Audio has come very late to this game --,I'm not talking about digitizing, and bits, and re-mastering.,I'm talking about turn it into the data that it was made from,,which is how it was performed.,And audio came very late because our ears are so hard to fool --,they're high-resolution, and they're wired straight to our emotions,,and you can't trick them very easily.,Your eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement, you know. 
 All right, there's this episode of "Star Trek.",(Laughter),I get it -- it was all just laid in for me yesterday there.,The episode of "Star Trek" for me was James Daly played Methuselah --,remember this one?,And at some point he's dancing with his --,and I won't ruin the episode for you, from 1967.,Right, do you know where I'm going?,And Nimoy, I'm sorry, Spock sits down at the piano,,and he starts playing this Brahms waltz, and they all dance to it.,And then Spock turns round, he goes,,"James, I know all of the Brahms waltzes,,and I don't believe this is one of them in the category.",That's where I'm at.,I want to hear the waltzes Brahms didn't write.,I want to hear the pieces that Horowitz didn't play.,But I believe we're on a path now, when we get to data,,that we can distill styles, and templates, and formulas, and all these kinds of things,,again, that you've seen happen in the computer graphics world.,It's now coming in this world.,The transition will be this one.,It says right now, we think music is notes and how they're played.,And I believe this is coming.,Because what you've just heard was a computer playing data --,no Glenn Gould in the room.,But yet, it was human.,And I believe you'll get to the next step, the real dream of listeners.,Every time you listen to a recording today,,every time you take out your iPod and whatever,,every time you listen to it, it's the same thing -- it's frozen.,Wouldn't it be cool if every time you listened, it could be different?,This morning, you're sadder, you want to hear your song,,the same song, played sadder than you did yesterday.,You want to hear it played by different musicians.,You want to hear it in different rooms and whatever. 
 We've seen all these "Star Treks," and they're all holodeck episodes as well.,Every time I listen to that, I get goose bumps.,It's so amazing, it's so exciting.,Every time I listen to that recording it's like, "Oh my God,,I can't believe I'm in the same room. I can't believe this is happening.",It's a way better experience,than whatever you're used to listening to, in whatever form.,And lastly, I will wrap up with one minute of Art Tatum.,So I've really overshot my budget here.,We made a new recording of him,playing in the Shrine Auditorium in September.,It was a concert he recorded in the Shrine Auditorium in 1949.,And I've got to tell you, we have this lab,where we build and measure everything, back in Raleigh, North Carolina,,and we flew out to Los Angeles.,And as the president of the company,,I didn't feel real comfortable about where we were.,That's a real uncomfortable feeling,,when all the equipment's come out and a whole Sony team,,and people are going to be sitting there in the audience.,And we put the piano on the sweet spot of the stage in the Shrine,,which has not changed since 1949, still seats 6,000 people.,And on the sweet spot on the stage, Tatum starts playing ...,and every note, every beat, every slur, every accent, every pedal,was perfect, because he played it for that room on that day.,And we captured all that data all over again.,And I want you to hear that right now.,And fortunately, it's right in here.,This is an encore he used to do.,It's one minute long.,It's an Irish jig, and I want you to hear his humor.,(Music),(Applause),And that's just what the live audience did.,(Applause),So thank you very much, Michael, thank you for the opportunity.So I'm going to talk today about collecting stories,in some unconventional ways.,This is a picture of me from a very awkward stage in my life.,You might enjoy the awkwardly tight, cut-off pajama bottoms with balloons.,Anyway, it was a time when I was mainly interested,in collecting imaginary stories.,So this is a picture of me,holding one of the first watercolor paintings I ever made.,And recently I've been much more interested in collecting stories,from reality -- so, real stories.,And specifically, I'm interested in collecting my own stories,,stories from the Internet, and then recently, stories from life,,which is kind of a new area of work that I've been doing recently.,So I'll be talking about each of those today.,So, first of all, my own stories. These are two of my sketchbooks.,I have many of these books,,and I've been keeping them for about the last eight or nine years.,They accompany me wherever I go in my life,,and I fill them with all sorts of things,,records of my lived experience:,so watercolor paintings, drawings of what I see,,dead flowers, dead insects, pasted ticket stubs, rusting coins,,business cards, writings.,And in these books, you can find these short, little glimpses,of moments and experiences and people that I meet.,And, you know, after keeping these books for a number of years,,I started to become very interested in collecting,not only my own personal artifacts,,but also the artifacts of other people.,So, I started collecting found objects.,This is a photograph I found lying in a gutter in New York City,about 10 years ago.,On the front, you can see the tattered black-and-white photo of a woman's face,,and on the back it says, "To Judy, the girl with the Bill Bailey voice.,Have fun in whatever you do.",And I really loved this idea of the partial glimpse into somebody's life.,As opposed to knowing the whole story, just knowing a little bit of the story,,and then letting your own mind fill in the rest.,And that idea of a partial glimpse is something,that will come back in a lot of the work I'll be showing later today.,So, around this time I was studying computer science at Princeton University,,and I noticed that it was suddenly possible,to collect these sorts of personal artifacts,,not just from street corners, but also from the Internet.,And that suddenly, people, en masse, were leaving scores and scores,of digital footprints online that told stories of their private lives.,Blog posts, photographs, thoughts, feelings, opinions,,all of these things were being expressed by people online,,and leaving behind trails.,So, I started to write computer programs,that study very, very large sets of these online footprints.,One such project is about a year and a half old.,It's called "We Feel Fine.",This is a project that scans the world's newly posted blog entries,every two or three minutes, searching for occurrences of the phrases,"I feel" and "I am feeling." And when it finds one of those phrases,,it grabs the full sentence up to the period,and also tries to identify demographic information about the author.,So, their gender, their age, their geographic location,and what the weather conditions were like when they wrote that sentence.,It collects about 20,000 such sentences a day,and it's been running for about a year and a half,,having collected over 10 and a half million feelings now.,This is, then, how they're presented.,These dots here represent some of the English-speaking world's,feelings from the last few hours,,each dot being a single sentence stated by a single blogger.,And the color of each dot corresponds to the type of feeling inside,,so the bright ones are happy, and the dark ones are sad.,And the diameter of each dot corresponds,to the length of the sentence inside.,So the small ones are short, and the bigger ones are longer.,"I feel fine with the body I'm in, there'll be no easy excuse,for why I still feel uncomfortable being close to my boyfriend,",from a twenty-two-year-old in Japan.,"I got this on some trading locally,,but really don't feel like screwing with wiring and crap.",Also, some of the feelings contain photographs in the blog posts.,And when that happens, these montage compositions are automatically created,,which consist of the sentence and images being combined.,And any of these can be opened up to reveal the sentence inside.,"I feel good.","I feel rough now, and I probably gained 100,000 pounds,,but it was worth it.","I love how they were able to preserve most in everything,that makes you feel close to nature -- butterflies,,man-made forests, limestone caves and hey, even a huge python.",So the next movement is called mobs.,This provides a slightly more statistical look at things.,This is showing the world's most common feelings overall right now,,dominated by better, then bad, then good, then guilty, and so on.,Weather causes the feelings to assume the physical traits,of the weather they represent. So the sunny ones swirl around,,the cloudy ones float along, the rainy ones fall down,,and the snowy ones flutter to the ground.,You can also stop a raindrop and open the feeling inside.,Finally, location causes the feelings to move to their spots,on a world map, giving you a sense of their geographic distribution.,So I'll show you now some of my favorite montages from "We Feel Fine.",These are the images that are automatically constructed.,"I feel like I'm diagonally parked in a parallel universe.",(Laughter),"I've kissed numerous other boys and it hasn't felt good,,the kisses felt messy and wrong,,but kissing Lucas feels beautiful and almost spiritual.","I can feel my cancer grow.","I feel pretty.","I feel skinny, but I'm not.","I'm 23, and a recovering meth and heroin addict,,and feel absolutely blessed to still be alive.","I can't wait to see them racing for the first time at Daytona next month,,because I feel the need for speed.",(Laughter),"I feel sassy.","I feel so sexy in this new wig.",As you can see, "We Feel Fine" collects,very, very small-scale personal stories.,Sometimes, stories as short as two or three words.,So, really even challenging the notion,of what can be considered a story.,And recently, I've become interested in diving much more deeply into a single story.,And that's led me to doing some work with the physical world,,not with the Internet,,and only using the Internet at the very last moment, as a presentation medium.,So these are some newer projects that,actually aren't even launched publicly yet.,The first such one is called "The Whale Hunt.",Last May, I spent nine days living up in Barrow, Alaska,,the northernmost settlement in the United States,,with a family of Inupiat Eskimos,,documenting their annual spring whale hunt.,This is the whaling camp here, we're about six miles from shore,,camping on five and a half feet of thick, frozen pack ice.,And that water that you see there is the open lead,,and through that lead, bowhead whales migrate north each springtime.,And the Eskimo community basically camps out on the edge of the ice here,,waits for a whale to come close enough to attack. And when it does,,it throws a harpoon at it, and then hauls the whale up,under the ice, and cuts it up.,And that would provide the community's food supply for a long time.,So I went up there, and I lived with these guys,out in their whaling camp here, and photographed the entire experience,,beginning with the taxi ride to Newark airport in New York,,and ending with the butchering of the second whale, seven and a half days later.,I photographed that entire experience at five-minute intervals.,So every five minutes, I took a photograph.,When I was awake, with the camera around my neck.,When I was sleeping, with a tripod and a timer.,And then in moments of high adrenaline,,like when something exciting was happening,,I would up that photographic frequency to as many as,37 photographs in five minutes.,So what this created was a photographic heartbeat,that sped up and slowed down, more or less matching,the changing pace of my own heartbeat.,That was the first concept here.,The second concept was to use this experience to think about,the fundamental components of any story.,What are the things that make up a story?,So, stories have characters. Stories have concepts.,Stories take place in a certain area. They have contexts.,They have colors. What do they look like?,They have time. When did it take place? Dates -- when did it occur?,And in the case of the whale hunt, also this idea of an excitement level.,The thing about stories, though, in most of the existing mediums,that we're accustomed to -- things like novels, radio,,photographs, movies, even lectures like this one --,we're very accustomed to this idea of the narrator or the camera position,,some kind of omniscient, external body,through whose eyes you see the story.,We're very used to this.,But if you think about real life, it's not like that at all.,I mean, in real life, things are much more nuanced and complex,,and there's all of these overlapping stories,intersecting and touching each other.,And so I thought it would be interesting to build a framework,to surface those types of stories. So, in the case of "The Whale Hunt,",how could we extract something like the story of Simeon and Crawford,,involving the concepts of wildlife, tools and blood, taking place on the Arctic Ocean,,dominated by the color red, happening around 10 a.m. on May 3,,with an excitement level of high?,So, how to extract this order of narrative from this larger story?,I built a web interface for viewing "The Whale Hunt" that attempts to do just this.,So these are all 3,214 pictures taken up there.,This is my studio in Brooklyn. This is the Arctic Ocean,,and the butchering of the second whale, seven days later.,You can start to see some of the story here, told by color.,So this red strip signifies the color of the wallpaper,in the basement apartment where I was staying.,And things go white as we move out onto the Arctic Ocean.,Introduction of red down here, when whales are being cut up.,You can see a timeline, showing you the exciting moments throughout the story.,These are organized chronologically.,Wheel provides a slightly more playful version of the same,,so these are also all the photographs organized chronologically.,And any of these can be clicked,,and then the narrative is entered at that position.,So here I am sleeping on the airplane heading up to Alaska.,That's "Moby Dick.",This is the food we ate.,This is in the Patkotak's family living room,in their house in Barrow. The boxed wine they served us.,Cigarette break outside -- I don't smoke.,This is a really exciting sequence of me sleeping.,This is out at whale camp, on the Arctic Ocean.,This graph that I'm clicking down here is meant to be,reminiscent of a medical heartbeat graph,,showing the exciting moments of adrenaline.,This is the ice starting to freeze over. The snow fence they built.,And so what I'll show you now is the ability to pull out sub-stories.,So, here you see the cast. These are all of the people in "The Whale Hunt",and the two whales that were killed down here.,And we could do something as arbitrary as, say,,extract the story of Rony, involving the concepts of blood,and whales and tools, taking place on the Arctic Ocean,,at Ahkivgaq camp, with the heartbeat level of fast.,And now we've whittled down that whole story,to just 29 matching photographs,,and then we can enter the narrative at that position.,And you can see Rony cutting up the whale here.,These whales are about 40 feet long,,and weighing over 40 tons. And they provide the food source,for the community for much of the year.,Skipping ahead a bit more here, this is Rony on the whale carcass.,They use no chainsaws or anything; it's entirely just blades,,and an incredibly efficient process.,This is the guys on the rope, pulling open the carcass.,This is the muktuk, or the blubber, all lined up for community distribution.,It's baleen. Moving on.,So what I'm going to tell you about next,is a very new thing. It's not even a project yet.,So, just yesterday, I flew in here from Singapore, and before that,,I was spending two weeks in Bhutan, the small Himalayan kingdom,nestled between Tibet and India.,And I was doing a project there about happiness,,interviewing a lot of local people.,So Bhutan has this really wacky thing where they base,most of their high-level governmental decisions around the concept,of gross national happiness instead of gross domestic product,,and they've been doing this since the '70s.,And it leads to just a completely different value system.,It's an incredibly non-materialistic culture,,where people don't have a lot, but they're incredibly happy.,So I went around and I talked to people about some of these ideas.,So, I did a number of things. I asked people a number of set questions,,and took a number of set photographs,,and interviewed them with audio, and also took pictures.,I would start by asking people to rate their happiness,between one and 10, which is kind of inherently absurd.,And then when they answered, I would inflate that number of balloons,and give them that number of balloons to hold.,So, you have some really happy person holding 10 balloons,,and some really sad soul holding one balloon.,But you know, even holding one balloon is like, kind of happy.,(Laughter),And then I would ask them a number of questions like,what was the happiest day in their life, what makes them happy.,And then finally, I would ask them to make a wish.,And when they made a wish, I would write their wish,onto one of the balloons and take a picture of them holding it.,So I'm going to show you now just a few brief snippets,of some of the interviews that I did, some of the people I spoke with.,This is an 11-year-old student.,He was playing cops and robbers with his friends, running around town,,and they all had plastic toy guns.,His wish was to become a police officer.,He was getting started early. Those were his hands.,I took pictures of everybody's hands,,because I think you can often tell a lot about somebody,from how their hands look. I took a portrait of everybody,,and asked everybody to make a funny face.,A 17-year-old student. Her wish was to have been born a boy.,She thinks that women have a pretty tough go of things in Bhutan,,and it's a lot easier if you're a boy.,A 28-year-old cell phone shop owner.,If you knew what Paro looked like, you'd understand,how amazing it is that there's a cell phone shop there.,He wanted to help poor people.,A 53-year-old farmer. She was chaffing wheat,,and that pile of wheat behind her,had taken her about a week to make.,She wanted to keep farming until she dies.,You can really start to see the stories told by the hands here.,She was wearing this silver ring that had the word "love" engraved on it,,and she'd found it in the road somewhere.,A 16-year-old quarry worker.,This guy was breaking rocks with a hammer in the hot sunlight,,but he just wanted to spend his life as a farmer.,A 21-year-old monk. He was very happy.,He wanted to live a long life at the monastery.,He had this amazing series of hairs growing out of a mole on the left side of his face,,which I'm told is very good luck.,He was kind of too shy to make a funny face.,A 16-year-old student.,She wanted to become an independent woman.,I asked her about that, and she said she meant,that she doesn't want to be married,,because, in her opinion, when you get married in Bhutan as a woman,,your chances to live an independent life kind of end,,and so she had no interest in that.,A 24-year-old truck driver.,There are these terrifyingly huge Indian trucks,that come careening around one-lane roads with two-lane traffic,,with 3,000-foot drop-offs right next to the road,,and he was driving one of these trucks.,But all he wanted was to just live a comfortable life, like other people.,A 24-year-old road sweeper. I caught her on her lunch break.,She'd built a little fire to keep warm, right next to the road.,Her wish was to marry someone with a car.,She wanted a change in her life.,She lives in a little worker's camp right next to the road,,and she wanted a different lot on things.,An 81-year-old itinerant farmer.,I saw this guy on the side of the road,,and he actually doesn't have a home.,He travels from farm to farm each day trying to find work,,and then he tries to sleep at whatever farm he gets work at.,So his wish was to come with me, so that he had somewhere to live.,He had this amazing knife that he pulled out of his gho,and started brandishing when I asked him to make a funny face.,It was all good-natured.,A 10-year-old.,He wanted to join a school and learn to read,,but his parents didn't have enough money to send him to school.,He was eating this orange, sugary candy,that he kept dipping his fingers into,,and since there was so much saliva on his hands,,this orange paste started to form on his palms.,(Laughter),A 37-year-old road worker.,One of the more touchy political subjects in Bhutan,is the use of Indian cheap labor,that they import from India to build the roads,,and then they send these people home once the roads are built.,So these guys were in a worker's gang,mixing up asphalt one morning on the side of the highway.,His wish was to make some money and open a store.,A 75-year-old farmer. She was selling oranges on the side of the road.,I asked her about her wish, and she said,,"You know, maybe I'll live, maybe I'll die, but I don't have a wish.",She was chewing betel nut, which caused her teeth,over the years to turn very red.,Finally, this is a 26-year-old nun I spoke to.,Her wish was to make a pilgrimage to Tibet.,I asked her how long she planned to live in the nunnery and she said,,"Well, you know, of course, it's impermanent,,but my plan is to live here until I'm 30, and then enter a hermitage.",And I said, "You mean, like a cave?" And she said, "Yeah, like a cave.",And I said, "Wow, and how long will you live in the cave?",And she said, "Well, you know,,I think I'd kind of like to live my whole life in the cave.",I just thought that was amazing. I mean, she spoke in a way --,with amazing English, and amazing humor, and amazing laughter --,that made her seem like somebody I could have bumped into,on the streets of New York, or in Vermont, where I'm from.,But here she had been living in a nunnery for the last seven years.,I asked her a little bit more about the cave,and what she planned would happen once she went there, you know.,What if she saw the truth after just one year,,what would she do for the next 35 years in her life?,And this is what she said.,Woman: I think I'm going to stay for 35. Maybe -- maybe I'll die.,Jonathan Harris: Maybe you'll die? Woman: Yes.,JH: 10 years? Woman: Yes, yes. JH: 10 years, that's a long time.,Woman: Yes, not maybe one, 10 years, maybe I can die,within one year, or something like that.,JH: Are you hoping to?,Woman: Ah, because you know, it's impermanent.,JH: Yeah, but -- yeah, OK. Do you hope --,would you prefer to live in the cave for 40 years,,or to live for one year?,Woman: But I prefer for maybe 40 to 50.,JH: 40 to 50? Yeah.,Woman: Yes. From then, I'm going to the heaven.,JH: Well, I wish you the best of luck with it.,Woman: Thank you.,JH: I hope it's everything that you hope it will be.,So thank you again, so much.,Woman: You're most welcome.,JH: So if you caught that, she said she hoped to die,when she was around 40. That was enough life for her.,So, the last thing we did, very quickly,,is I took all those wish balloons -- there were 117 interviews,,117 wishes -- and I brought them up to a place called Dochula,,which is a mountain pass in Bhutan, at 10,300 feet,,one of the more sacred places in Bhutan.,And up there, there are thousands of prayer flags,that people have spread out over the years.,And we re-inflated all of the balloons, put them up on a string,,and hung them up there among the prayer flags.,And they're actually still flying up there today.,So if any of you have any Bhutan travel plans in the near future,,you can go check these out. Here are some images from that.,We said a Buddhist prayer so that all these wishes could come true.,You can start to see some familiar balloons here.,"To make some money and to open a store" was the Indian road worker.,Thanks very much.,(Applause)The Internet, the Web as we know it,,the kind of Web -- the things we're all talking about --,is already less than 5,000 days old.,So all of the things that we've seen come about,,starting, say, with satellite images of the whole Earth,,which we couldn't even imagine happening before,,all these things rolling into our lives,,just this abundance of things that are right before us,,sitting in front of our laptop, or our desktop.,This kind of cornucopia of stuff,just coming and never ending is amazing, and we're not amazed.,It's really amazing that all this stuff is here.,(Laughter),It's in 5,000 days, all this stuff has come.,And I know that 10 years ago,,if I had told you that this was all coming,,you would have said that that's impossible.,There's simply no economic model that that would be possible.,And if I told you it was all coming for free,,you would say, this is simply -- you're dreaming.,You're a Californian utopian. You're a wild-eyed optimist.,And yet it's here. 
 The other thing that we know about it was that 10 years ago,,as I looked at what even Wired was talking about,,we thought it was going to be TV, but better.,That was the model. That was what everybody was suggesting,was going to be coming.,And it turns out that that's not what it was.,First of all, it was impossible, and it's not what it was.,And so one of the things that I think we're learning --,if you think about, like, Wikipedia,,it's something that was simply impossible.,It's impossible in theory, but possible in practice.,And if you take all these things that are impossible,,I think one of the things that we're learning from this era,,from this last decade, is that we have to get good at believing in the impossible,,because we're unprepared for it. 
 So, I'm curious about what's going to happen in the next 5,000 days.,But if that's happened in the last 5,000 days,,what's going to happen in the next 5,000 days?,So, I have a kind of a simple story,,and it suggests that what we want to think about is this thing that we're making,,this thing that has happened in 5,000 days --,that's all these computers, all these handhelds,,all these cell phones, all these laptops, all these servers --,basically what we're getting out of all these connections,is we're getting one machine.,If there is only one machine, and our little handhelds and devices,are actually just little windows into those machines,,but that we're basically constructing a single, global machine. 
 And so I began to think about that.,And it turned out that this machine happens to be,the most reliable machine that we've ever made.,It has not crashed; it's running uninterrupted.,And there's almost no other machine that we've ever made,that runs the number of hours, the number of days.,5,000 days without interruption -- that's just unbelievable.,And of course, the Internet is longer than just 5,000 days;,the Web is only 5,000 days.,So, I was trying to basically make measurements.,What are the dimensions of this machine?,And I started off by calculating how many billions of clicks there are,all around the globe on all the computers.,And there is a 100 billion clicks per day.,And there's 55 trillion links between all the Web pages of the world. 
 And so I began thinking more about other kinds of dimensions,,and I made a quick list. Was it Chris Jordan, the photographer,,talking about numbers being so large that they're meaningless?,Well, here's a list of them. They're hard to tell,,but there's one billion PC chips on the Internet,,if you count all the chips in all the computers on the Internet.,There's two million emails per second.,So it's a very big number.,It's just a huge machine,,and it uses five percent of the global electricity on the planet.,So here's the specifications,,just as if you were to make up a spec sheet for it:,170 quadrillion transistors, 55 trillion links,,emails running at two megahertz itself,,31 kilohertz text messaging,,246 exabyte storage. That's a big disk.,That's a lot of storage, memory. Nine exabyte RAM.,And the total traffic on this,is running at seven terabytes per second.,Brewster was saying the Library of Congress is about twenty terabytes.,So every second, half of the Library of Congress,is swooshing around in this machine. It's a big machine. 
 So I did something else. I figured out 100 billion clicks per day,,55 trillion links is almost the same,as the number of synapses in your brain.,A quadrillion transistors is almost the same,as the number of neurons in your brain.,So to a first approximation, we have these things --,twenty petahertz synapse firings.,Of course, the memory is really huge.,But to a first approximation, the size of this machine is the size --,and its complexity, kind of -- to your brain.,Because in fact, that's how your brain works -- in kind of the same way that the Web works.,However, your brain isn't doubling every two years.,So if we say this machine right now that we've made,is about one HB, one human brain,,if we look at the rate that this is increasing,,30 years from now, there'll be six billion HBs.,So by the year 2040, the total processing of this machine,will exceed a total processing power of humanity, 
 in raw bits and stuff. And this is, I think, where,Ray Kurzweil and others get this little chart saying that we're going to cross.,So, what about that? Well, here's a couple of things.,I have three kind of general things,I would like to say, three consequences of this.,First, that basically what this machine is doing is embodying.,We're giving it a body. And that's what we're going to do,in the next 5,000 days -- we're going to give this machine a body.,And the second thing is, we're going to restructure its architecture.,And thirdly, we're going to become completely codependent upon it. 
 So let me go through those three things.,First of all, we have all these things in our hands.,We think they're all separate devices,,but in fact, every screen in the world,is looking into the one machine.,These are all basically portals into that one machine.,The second thing is that -- some people call this the cloud,,and you're kind of touching the cloud with this.,And so in some ways, all you really need is a cloudbook.,And the cloudbook doesn't have any storage.,It's wireless. It's always connected.,There's many things about it. It becomes very simple,,and basically what you're doing is you're just touching the machine,,you're touching the cloud and you're going to compute that way.,So the machine is computing. 
 And in some ways, it's sort of back,to the kind of old idea of centralized computing.,But everything, all the cameras, and the microphones,,and the sensors in cars,and everything is connected to this machine.,And everything will go through the Web.,And we're seeing that already with, say, phones.,Right now, phones don't go through the Web,,but they are beginning to, and they will.,And if you imagine what, say, just as an example, what Google Labs has,in terms of experiments with Google Docs, Google Spreadsheets, blah, blah, blah --,all these things are going to become Web based.,They're going through the machine.,And I am suggesting that every bit will be owned by the Web.,Right now, it's not. If you do spreadsheets and things at work,,a Word document, they aren't on the Web,,but they are going to be. They're going to be part of this machine.,They're going to speak the Web language.,They're going to talk to the machine.,The Web, in some sense, is kind of like a black hole,that's sucking up everything into it.,And so every thing will be part of the Web.,So every item, every artifact that we make, will have embedded in it,some little sliver of Web-ness and connection,,and it will be part of this machine,,so that our environment -- kind of in that ubiquitous computing sense --,our environment becomes the Web. Everything is connected. 
 Now, with RFIDs and other things -- whatever technology it is,,it doesn't really matter. The point is that everything,will have embedded in it some sensor connecting it to the machine,,and so we have, basically, an Internet of things.,So you begin to think of a shoe as a chip with heels,,and a car as a chip with wheels,,because basically most of the cost of manufacturing cars,is the embedded intelligence and electronics in it, and not the materials.,A lot of people think about the new economy,as something that was going to be a disembodied,,alternative, virtual existence,,and that we would have the old economy of atoms.,But in fact, what the new economy really is,is the marriage of those two, where we embed the information,,and the digital nature of things into the material world.,That's what we're looking forward to. That is where we're going --,this union, this convergence of the atomic and the digital. 
 And so one of the consequences of that, I believe,,is that where we have this sort of spectrum of media right now --,TV, film, video -- that basically becomes one media platform.,And while there's many differences in some senses,,they will share more and more in common with each other.,So that the laws of media, such as the fact that copies have no value,,the value's in the uncopiable things,,the immediacy, the authentication, the personalization.,The media wants to be liquid.,The reason why things are free is so that you can manipulate them,,not so that they are "free" as in "beer," but "free" as in "freedom.",And the network effects rule,,meaning that the more you have, the more you get.,The first fax machine -- the person who bought the first fax machine,was an idiot, because there was nobody to fax to.,But here she became an evangelist, recruiting others,to get the fax machines because it made their purchase more valuable.,Those are the effects that we're going to see.,Attention is the currency. 
 So those laws are going to kind of spread throughout all media.,And the other thing about this embodiment,is that there's kind of what I call the McLuhan reversal.,McLuhan was saying, "Machines are the extensions of the human senses.",And I'm saying, "Humans are now going to be,the extended senses of the machine," in a certain sense.,So we have a trillion eyes, and ears, and touches,,through all our digital photographs and cameras.,And we see that in things like Flickr,,or Photosynth, this program from Microsoft,that will allow you to assemble a view of a touristy place,from the thousands of tourist snapshots of it.,In a certain sense, the machine is seeing through the pixels of individual cameras. 
 Now, the second thing that I want to talk about was this idea of restructuring,,that what the Web is doing is restructuring.,And I have to warn you, that what we'll talk about is --,I'm going to give my explanation of a term you're hearing, which is a "semantic Web." 
 So first of all, the first stage that we've seen,of the Internet was that it was going to link computers.,And that's what we called the Net; that was the Internet of nets.,And we saw that, where you have all the computers of the world.,And if you remember, it was a kind of green screen with cursors,,and there was really not much to do, and if you wanted to connect it,,you connected it from one computer to another computer.,And what you had to do was -- if you wanted to participate in this,,you had to share packets of information.,So you were forwarding on. You didn't have control.,It wasn't like a telephone system where you had control of a line:,you had to share packets. 
 The second stage that we're in now is the idea of linking pages.,So in the old one, if I wanted to go on to an airline Web page,,I went from my computer, to an FTP site, to another airline computer.,Now we have pages -- the unit has been resolved into pages,,so one page links to another page.,And if I want to go in to book a flight,,I go into the airline's flight page, the website of the airline,,and I'm linking to that page.,And what we're sharing were links, so you had to be kind of open with links.,You couldn't deny -- if someone wanted to link to you,,you couldn't stop them. You had to participate in this idea,of opening up your pages to be linked by anybody.,So that's what we were doing. 
 We're now entering to the third stage, which is what I'm talking about,,and that is where we link the data.,So, I don't know what the name of this thing is.,I'm calling it the one machine. But we're linking data.,So we're going from machine to machine,,from page to page, and now data to data.,So the difference is, is that rather than linking from page to page,,we're actually going to link from one idea on a page,to another idea, rather than to the other page.,So every idea is basically being supported --,or every item, or every noun -- is being supported by the entire Web.,It's being resolved at the level of items, or ideas, or words, if you want.,So besides physically coming out again into this idea,that it's not just virtual, it's actually going out to things.,So something will resolve down to the information,about a particular person, so every person will have a unique ID.,Every person, every item will have a something,that will be very specific, and will link,to a specific representation of that idea or item.,So now, in this new one, when I link to it,,I would link to my particular flight, my particular seat.,And so, giving an example of this thing,,I live in Pacifica, rather than -- right now Pacifica,is just sort of a name on the Web somewhere.,The Web doesn't know that that is actually a town,,and that it's a specific town that I live in,,but that's what we're going to be talking about.,It's going to link directly to --,it will know, the Web will be able to read itself,and know that that actually is a place,,and that whenever it sees that word, "Pacifica,",it knows that it actually has a place,,latitude, longitude, a certain population. 
 So here are some of the technical terms, all three-letter things,,that you'll see a lot more of.,All these things are about enabling this idea of linking to the data.,So I'll give you one kind of an example.,There's like a billion social sites on the Web.,Each time you go into there, you have to tell it again who you are,and all your friends are.,Why should you be doing that? You should just do that once,,and it should know who all your friends are.,So that's what you want, is all your friends are identified,,and you should just carry these relationships around.,All this data about you should just be conveyed,,and you should do it once and that's all that should happen.,And you should have all the networks,of all the relationships between those pieces of data.,That's what we're moving into -- where it sort of knows these things down to that level.,A semantic Web, Web 3.0, giant global graph --,we're kind of trying out what we want to call this thing.,But what's it's doing is sharing data.,So you have to be open to having your data shared, which is a much bigger step,than just sharing your Web page, or your computer.,And all these things that are going to be on this,are not just pages, they are things.,Everything we've described, every artifact or place,,will be a specific representation,,will have a specific character that can be linked to directly.,So we have this database of things.,And so there's actually a fourth thing that we have not get to,,that we won't see in the next 10 years, or 5,000 days,,but I think that's where we're going to. And as the Internet of things --,where I'm linking directly to the particular things of my seat on the plane --,that that physical thing becomes part of the Web.,And so we are in the middle of this thing,that's completely linked, down to every object,in the little sliver of a connection that it has. 
 So, the last thing I want to talk about is this idea,that we're going to be codependent.,It's always going to be there, and the closer it is, the better.,If you allow Google to, it will tell you your search history.,And I found out by looking at it,that I search most at 11 o'clock in the morning.,So I am open, and being transparent to that.,And I think total personalization in this new world will require total transparency.,That is going to be the price.,If you want to have total personalization,,you have to be totally transparent.,Google. I can't remember my phone number, I'll just ask Google.,We're so dependent on this that I have now gotten to the point,where I don't even try to remember things --,I'll just Google it. It's easier to do that.,And we kind of object at first, saying, "Oh, that's awful.",But if we think about the dependency that we have on this other technology,,called the alphabet, and writing,,we're totally dependent on it, and it's transformed culture.,We cannot imagine ourselves without the alphabet and writing.,And so in the same way, we're going to not imagine ourselves,without this other machine being there.,And what is happening with this is,some kind of AI, but it's not the AI in conscious AI,,as being an expert, Larry Page told me,that that's what they're trying to do,,and that's what they're trying to do.,But when six billion humans are Googling,,who's searching who? It goes both ways.,So we are the Web, that's what this thing is.,We are going to be the machine.,So the next 5,000 days, it's not going to be the Web and only better.,Just like it wasn't TV and only better.,The next 5,000 days, it's not just going to be the Web,but only better -- it's going to be something different.,And I think it's going to be smarter.,It'll have an intelligence in there, that's not, again, conscious.,But it'll anticipate what we're doing, in a good sense.,Secondly, it's become much more personalized.,It will know us, and that's good.,And again, the price of that will be transparency.,And thirdly, it's going to become more ubiquitous,in terms of filling your entire environment, and we will be in the middle of it.,And all these devices will be portals into that. 
 So the single idea that I wanted to leave with you,is that we have to begin to think about this as not just "the Web, only better,",but a new kind of stage in this development.,It looks more global. If you take this whole thing,,it is a very big machine, very reliable machine,,more reliable than its parts.,But we can also think about it as kind of a large organism.,So we might respond to it more as if this was a whole system,,more as if this wasn't a large organism,that we are going to be interacting with. It's a "One.",And I don't know what else to call it, than the One.,We'll have a better word for it.,But there's a unity of some sort that's starting to emerge.,And again, I don't want to talk about consciousness,,I want to talk about it just as if it was a little bacteria,,or a volvox, which is what that organism is. 
 So, to do, action, take-away. So, here's what I would say:,there's only one machine, and the Web is its OS.,All screens look into the One. No bits will live outside the Web.,To share is to gain. Let the One read it.,It's going to be machine-readable.,You want to make something that the machine can read.,And the One is us. We are in the One.,I appreciate your time.,(Applause)Aside from keeping the rain out and producing some usable space,,architecture is nothing but a special-effects machine,that delights and disturbs the senses. 
 Our work is across media. The work comes in all shapes and sizes.,It's small and large. This is an ashtray, a water glass.,From urban planning and master planning,to theater and all sorts of stuff.,The thing that all the work has in common,is that it challenges the assumptions about conventions of space.,And these are everyday conventions,,conventions that are so obvious that we are blinded by their familiarity.,And I've assembled a sampling of work,that all share a kind of productive nihilism,that's used in the service of creating a particular special effect.,And that is something like nothing, or something next to nothing.,It's done through a form of subtraction or obstruction or interference,in a world that we naturally sleepwalk through. 
 This is an image that won us a competition,for an exhibition pavilion for the Swiss Expo 2002,on Lake Neuchatel, near Geneva.,And we wanted to use the water not only as a context,,but as a primary building material.,We wanted to make an architecture of atmosphere.,So, no walls, no roof, no purpose --,just a mass of atomized water, a big cloud.,And this proposal was a reaction to the over-saturation,of emergent technologies in recent national and world expositions,,which feeds, or has been feeding, our insatiable appetite,for visual stimulation with an ever greater digital virtuosity.,High definition, in our opinion, has become the new orthodoxy.,And we ask the question, can we use technology, high technology,,to make an expo pavilion that's decidedly low definition,,that also challenges the conventions of space and skin,,and rethinks our dependence on vision? 
 So this is how we sought to do it.,Water's pumped from the lake and is filtered,and shot as a fine mist through an array of high-pressure fog nozzles,,35,000 of them. And a weather station is on the structure.,It reads the shifting conditions of temperature, humidity,,wind direction, wind speed, dew point,,and it processes this data in a central computer,that calibrates the degree of water pressure,and distribution of water throughout.,And it's a responsive system that's trained on actual weather.,So, this is just in construction, and there's a tensegrity structure.,It's about 300 feet wide, the size of a football field,,and it sits on just four very delicate columns.,These are the fog nozzles, the interface,,and basically the system is kind of reading the real weather,,and producing kind of semi-artificial and real weather.,So, we're very interested in creating weather. I don't know why. 
 Now, here we go, one side, the outside,and then from the inside of the space,you can see what the quality of the space was.,Unlike entering any normal space,,entering Blur is like stepping into a habitable medium.,It's formless, featureless, depthless, scaleless, massless,,purposeless and dimensionless.,All references are erased,,leaving only an optical whiteout and white noise of the pulsing nozzles.,So, this is an exhibition pavilion,where there is absolutely nothing to see and nothing to do.,And we pride ourselves -- it's a spectacular anti-spectacle,in which all the conventions of spectacle are turned on their head.,So, the audience is dispersed,,focused attention and dramatic build-up and climax,are all replaced by a kind of attenuated attention,that's sustained by a sense of apprehension caused by the fog.,And this is very much like how the Victorian novel used fog in this way.,So here the world is put out of focus,,while our visual dependence is put into focus.,The public, you know, once disoriented,can actually ascend to the angel deck above,and then just come down under those lips into the water bar.,So, all the waters of the world are served there,,so we thought that, you know, after being at the water,and moving through the water and breathing the water,,you could also drink this building. 
 And so it is sort of a theme,,but it goes a little bit, you know, deeper than that.,We really wanted to bring out,our absolute dependence on this master sense,,and maybe share our kind of sensibility with our other senses.,You know, when we did this project it was a kind of tough sell,,because the Swiss said, "Well, why are we going to spend, you know,,10 million dollars producing an effect,that we already have in natural abundance that we hate?",And, you know, we thought -- well, we tried to convince them.,And in the end, you know, they adapted this as a national icon,that came to represent Swiss doubt, which we -- you know,,it was kind of a meaning machine,that everybody kind of laid on their own meanings off of.,Anyway, it's a temporary structure that was ultimately destroyed,,and so it's now a memory of an apparition, actually,,but it continues to live in edible form.,And this is the highest honor,to be bestowed upon an architect in Switzerland -- to have a chocolate bar. 
 Anyway, moving along.,So in the '80s and '90s, we were mostly known for independent work,,such as installation artist, architect,,commissioned projects by museums and non-for-profit organizations.,And we did a lot of media work,,also a lot of experimental theater projects.,In 2003, the Whitney mounted a retrospective of our work,that featured a lot of this work from the '80s and '90s.,However, the work itself resisted the very nature of a retrospective,,and this is just some of the stuff that was in the show.,This was a piece on tourism in the United States.,This is "Soft Sell" for 42nd Street.,This was something done at the Cartier Foundation.,"Master/Slave" at the MOMA, the project series, a piece called "Parasite.",And so there were many, many of these kinds of projects. 
 Anyway, they gave us the whole fourth floor, and, you know,,the problem of the retrospective,was something we were very uncomfortable with.,It's a kind of invention of the museum,that's supposed to bring a kind of cohesive understanding,to the public of a body of work.,And our work doesn't really resolve itself into a body in any way at all.,And one of the recurring themes, by the way, that in the work,was a kind of hostility toward the museum itself,,and asking about the conventions of the museum, like the wall, the white wall.,So, what you see here,is basically a plan of many installations that were put there.,And we actually had to install white walls,to separate these pieces, which didn't belong together.,But these white walls became a kind of target and weapon at the same time.,We used the wall to partition the 13 installations of the project,and produce a kind of acoustic and visual separation. 
 And what you see is -- actually,,the red dotted line shows the track of this performing element,,which was a new piece that created -- that we created for the --,which was a robotic drill, basically, that went all the way around,,cruised the museum, went all around the walls and did a lot of damage.,So, the drill was mounted on this robotic arm.,We worked with, by the way, Honeybee Robotics. This is the brain.,Honeybee Robotics designed the Mars Driller,,and it was really very much fun to work with them.,They weren't doing their primary work, which was for the government,,while they were helping us with this.,In any case, the way it works is that,an intelligent navigator basically maps the entire surface of these walls.,So, unfolded it's about 300 linear feet.,And it randomly generates points within a three-dimensional matrix.,It selects a point, it guides the drill to that point, it pierces the dry wall,,leaving a half-inch hole before traveling to the next location.,Initially these holes were lone blemishes,,and as the exhibition continued,the walls became increasingly perforated. 
 So eventually holes on both sides of the wall aligned,,opening views from gallery to gallery.,Clusters of holes randomly opened up sections of wall.,And so this was a three-month performance piece,in which the wall was made into kind of an increasingly unstable element.,And also the acoustic separation was destroyed.,Also the visual separation.,And there was also this constant background groan, which was very annoying.,And this is one of the blackout spaces,where there's a video piece that became totally not useful.,So rather than securing a neutral background for the artworks on display,,the wall now actively competed for attention.,And this acoustical nuisance and visual nuisance,basically exposed the discomfort of the work,to this encompassing nature of the retrospective.,It was really great when it started to break up all of the curatorial text. 
 Moving along to a project that we finished about a year ago.,It's the ICA -- the Institute of Contemporary Art -- in Boston,,which is on the waterfront.,And there's not enough time to really introduce the building,,but I'll simply say that the building negotiates,between this outwardly focused nature of the site --,you know, it's a really great waterfront site in Boston --,and this contradictory other desire to have an inwardly focused museum.,So, the nature of the building is that it looks at looking --,I mean that's its primary objective,,both its program and its architectural conceit.,The building incorporates the site,,but it dispenses it in very small doses,in the way that the museum is choreographed.,So, you come in and you're basically squeezed by the theater,,by the belly of the theater, into this very compressed space,where the view is turned off.,Then you come up in this glass elevator right near the curtain wall.,This elevator's about the size of a New York City studio apartment. 
 And then, this is a view going up,,and then you could come into the theater,,which can actually deny the view or open it up and become a backdrop.,And many musicians choose to use the theater glass walls totally open.,The view is denied in the galleries,where we receive just natural light,,and then exposed again in the north gallery with a panoramic view.,The original intention of this space,,which was unfortunately never realized,,was to use lenticular glass,which allowed only a kind of perpendicular view out.,In this very narrow space that connects east and west galleries,the intention was really to not get a climax,,but to have the view stalk you,,so the view would open up as you walked from one end to the other.,This was eliminated because the view was too good,,and the mayor said, "No, we just want this open.",The architect lost here. 
 But culminating -- and that's where this hooks into the theme of my little talk --,is this Mediatheque,,which is suspended from the cantilevered portion of the building.,So this is an 80-foot cantilever -- it's quite substantial.,So, it's already sticking out into space enough,,and then from that is this, is this small area called the Mediatheque.,The Mediatheque has something like 16 stations,where the public can get onto the server,and look at digital artworks or also curated artworks off the web.,And this was really a kind of very important part of this building,,and here is a point where architecture --,this is like technology-free -- architecture is only a framing device,,it only edits the harbor view, the industrial harbor,just through its walls, its floors and its ceiling,,to only expose the water itself, the texture of water,,much like a hypnotic effect created by electronic snow,or a lava lamp or something like that.,And here is where we really felt that there was a great convergence,of the technological and the natural in the project.,But there is just no information, it's just -- it's just hypnosis. 
 Moving along to Lincoln Center.,These are the guys that did the project in the first place, 50 years ago.,We're taking over now, doing work that ranges in scale,from small-scale repairs to major renovations and major facility expansions.,But we're doing it with a lot less testosterone.,This is the extent of the work that's to be completed by 2010.,And for the purposes of this talk,,I wanted to isolate just a part of a project that's even a part of a project,that touches a little bit on this theme of architectural special effects,,and it happens to be our current obsession,,and it plays a little bit with the purging and adding of distraction.,It's Alice Tully Hall, and it's tucked under the Juilliard Building,and descends several levels under the street.,So, this is the entrance to Tully Hall as it used to be,,before the renovation, which we just started.,And we asked ourselves, why couldn't it be exhibitionistic,,like the Met, or like some of the other buildings at Lincoln Center?,And one of the things that we were asked to do,was give it a street identity, expand the lobbies and make it visually accessible.,And this building, which is just naturally hermetic, we stripped.,We basically did a striptease, architectural striptease,,where we're framing with this kind of canopy --,the underside of three levels of expansion of Juilliard,,about 45,000 square feet -- cutting it to the angle of Broadway,,and then exposing, using that canopy to frame Tully Hall.,Before and after shot. (Applause),Wait a minute, it's just in that state, we have a long way to go. 
 But what I wanted to do was take a couple of seconds that I have left,to just talk about the hall itself,,which is kind of where we're really doing a massive amount of work.,So, the hall is a multi-purpose hall.,The clients have asked us to produce a great chamber music hall.,Now, that's really tough to do with a hall that has 1,100 seats.,Chamber and the notion of chamber has to do with salons,and small-scale performances. They asked us to bring an intimacy.,How do you bring an intimacy into a hall?,Intimacy for us means a lot of different things.,It means acoustic intimacy and it means visual intimacy. 
 One thing is that the subway is running and rumbling right under the hall.,Another thing that could be fixed is the shape of the hall.,It's like a coffin, it basically sends all the sound,,like a gutter-ball effect, down the aisles.,The walls are made of absorptive surface,,half absorptive, half reflective,,which is not very good for concert sound. 
 This is Avery Fisher Hall, but the notion of junk -- visual junk --,was very, very important to us, to get rid of visual noise.,Because we can't eliminate a single seat,,the architecture is restricted to 18 inches.,So it's a very, very thin architecture.,First we do a kind of partial box and box separation,,to take away the distraction of the subway noise.,Next we wrap the entire hall -- almost like this Olivetti keyboard --,with a material, with a wood material,that basically covers all the surfaces:,wall, ceiling, floor, stage, steps, everything, boxes.,But it's acoustically engineered to focus the sound into the house,and back to the stage. And here's an acoustic shelf.,Looking up the hall. Just a section of the stage.,Just everything is lined, it incorporates --,every single thing that you could possibly imagine,is tucked into this high-performance skin.,But one more added feature. 
 So now that we've stripped the hall of all visual distraction,,everything that prevents this intimacy,which is supposed to connect the house, the audience,,with the performers, we add one little detail,,one piece of architectural excess, a special effect: lighting.,We very strongly believe that the theatrics of a concert hall,is as much in the space of intermission and the space of arrival,as it is when the concert starts.,So what we wanted to do was produce this effect,,this lighting effect,,which made us have to bioengineer the wood walls.,And what it entails is the use of resin, of this very thick resin,with a veneer of the same kind of wood that's used throughout the hall,,in a kind of seamless continuity,that wraps the hall in light, like a belt of light: rather than separating,,like a proscenium would separate the audience from performers,,it connects audience with players. 
 And this is a mockup that is in Salt Lake City,that gives you a sense of what this is going to look like in full-scale.,And this is a guy from Salt Lake City,,this is what they look like out there.,(Laughter),And for us, I mean it's really kind of a very strange thing,,but the moments in the hall that the buzz kind of dies down,when the audience is waiting for the performance to begin,,very similar to the parting of curtains or the raising of a chandelier,,the walls will just exude this glow, temporarily stealing attention from the stage.,And this is Tully in construction now. 
 I have no ending to say, except that I'm a couple of minutes over. 
 Thank you very much.,(Applause)I write about food. I write about cooking.,I take it quite seriously,,but I'm here to talk about something,that's become very important to me in the last year or two.,It is about food, but it's not about cooking, per se.,I'm going to start with this picture of a beautiful cow.,I'm not a vegetarian -- this is the old Nixon line, right?,But I still think that this --,(Laughter),-- may be this year's version of this. 
 Now, that is only a little bit hyperbolic.,And why do I say it?,Because only once before has the fate of individual people,and the fate of all of humanity,been so intertwined.,There was the bomb, and there's now.,And where we go from here is going to determine,not only the quality and the length of our individual lives,,but whether, if we could see the Earth a century from now,,we'd recognize it.,It's a holocaust of a different kind,,and hiding under our desks isn't going to help.,Start with the notion that global warming,is not only real, but dangerous.,Since every scientist in the world now believes this,,and even President Bush has seen the light, or pretends to,,we can take this is a given. 
 Then hear this, please.,After energy production, livestock is the second-highest contributor,to atmosphere-altering gases.,Nearly one-fifth of all greenhouse gas,is generated by livestock production --,more than transportation.,Now, you can make all the jokes you want about cow farts,,but methane is 20 times more poisonous than CO2,,and it's not just methane.,Livestock is also one of the biggest culprits in land degradation,,air and water pollution, water shortages and loss of biodiversity.,There's more.,Like half the antibiotics in this country,are not administered to people, but to animals.,But lists like this become kind of numbing, so let me just say this:,if you're a progressive,,if you're driving a Prius, or you're shopping green,,or you're looking for organic,,you should probably be a semi-vegetarian.,Now, I'm no more anti-cattle than I am anti-atom,,but it's all in the way we use these things.,There's another piece of the puzzle,,which Ann Cooper talked about beautifully yesterday,,and one you already know. 
 There's no question, none, that so-called lifestyle diseases --,diabetes, heart disease, stroke, some cancers --,are diseases that are far more prevalent here,than anywhere in the rest of the world.,And that's the direct result of eating a Western diet.,Our demand for meat, dairy and refined carbohydrates --,the world consumes one billion cans or bottles of Coke a day --,our demand for these things, not our need, our want,,drives us to consume way more calories than are good for us.,And those calories are in foods that cause, not prevent, disease.,Now global warming was unforeseen.,We didn't know that pollution did more than cause bad visibility.,Maybe a few lung diseases here and there,,but, you know, that's not such a big deal.,The current health crisis, however,,is a little more the work of the evil empire.,We were told, we were assured,,that the more meat and dairy and poultry we ate,,the healthier we'd be. 
 No. Overconsumption of animals, and of course, junk food,,is the problem, along with our paltry consumption of plants.,Now, there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here,,but the evidence is that plants -- and I want to make this clear --,it's not the ingredients in plants, it's the plants.,It's not the beta-carotene, it's the carrot.,The evidence is very clear that plants promote health.,This evidence is overwhelming at this point.,You eat more plants, you eat less other stuff, you live longer.,Not bad.,But back to animals and junk food.,What do they have in common?,One: we don't need either of them for health.,We don't need animal products,,and we certainly don't need white bread or Coke.,Two: both have been marketed heavily,,creating unnatural demand.,We're not born craving Whoppers or Skittles.,Three: their production has been supported by government agencies,at the expense of a more health- and Earth-friendly diet. 
 Now, let's imagine a parallel.,Let's pretend that our government supported an oil-based economy,,while discouraging more sustainable forms of energy,,knowing all the while that the result would be,pollution, war and rising costs.,Incredible, isn't it?,Yet they do that.,And they do this here. It's the same deal.,The sad thing is, when it comes to diet,,is that even when well-intentioned Feds,try to do right by us, they fail.,Either they're outvoted by puppets of agribusiness,,or they are puppets of agribusiness.,So, when the USDA finally acknowledged,that it was plants, rather than animals, that made people healthy,,they encouraged us, via their overly simplistic food pyramid,,to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day,,along with more carbs.,What they didn't tell us is that some carbs are better than others,,and that plants and whole grains,should be supplanting eating junk food.,But industry lobbyists would never let that happen.,And guess what?,Half the people who developed the food pyramid,have ties to agribusiness.,So, instead of substituting plants for animals,,our swollen appetites simply became larger,,and the most dangerous aspects of them remained unchanged.,So-called low-fat diets, so-called low-carb diets --,these are not solutions. 
 But with lots of intelligent people,focusing on whether food is organic or local,,or whether we're being nice to animals,,the most important issues just aren't being addressed.,Now, don't get me wrong.,I like animals,,and I don't think it's just fine to industrialize their production,and to churn them out like they were wrenches.,But there's no way to treat animals well,,when you're killing 10 billion of them a year.,That's our number. 10 billion.,If you strung all of them --,chickens, cows, pigs and lambs -- to the moon,,they'd go there and back five times, there and back.,Now, my math's a little shaky, but this is pretty good,,and it depends whether a pig is four feet long or five feet long,,but you get the idea.,That's just the United States.,And with our hyper-consumption of those animals,producing greenhouse gases and heart disease,,kindness might just be a bit of a red herring.,Let's get the numbers of the animals we're killing for eating down,,and then we'll worry about being nice to the ones that are left. 
 Another red herring might be exemplified by the word "locavore,",which was just named word of the year by the New Oxford American Dictionary.,Seriously.,And locavore, for those of you who don't know,,is someone who eats only locally grown food --,which is fine if you live in California,,but for the rest of us it's a bit of a sad joke.,Between the official story -- the food pyramid --,and the hip locavore vision,,you have two versions of how to improve our eating.,(Laughter). 
 They both get it wrong, though.,The first at least is populist, and the second is elitist.,How we got to this place is the history of food in the United States.,And I'm going to go through that,,at least the last hundred years or so, very quickly right now.,A hundred years ago, guess what?,Everyone was a locavore: even New York had pig farms nearby,,and shipping food all over the place was a ridiculous notion.,Every family had a cook, usually a mom.,And those moms bought and prepared food.,It was like your romantic vision of Europe.,Margarine didn't exist.,In fact, when margarine was invented,,several states passed laws declaring that it had to be dyed pink,,so we'd all know that it was a fake.,There was no snack food, and until the '20s,,until Clarence Birdseye came along, there was no frozen food.,There were no restaurant chains.,There were neighborhood restaurants run by local people,,but none of them would think to open another one.,Eating ethnic was unheard of unless you were ethnic.,And fancy food was entirely French.,As an aside, those of you who remember,Dan Aykroyd in the 1970s doing Julia Child imitations,can see where he got the idea of stabbing himself from this fabulous slide.,(Laughter) 
 Back in those days, before even Julia,,back in those days, there was no philosophy of food.,You just ate.,You didn't claim to be anything.,There was no marketing. There were no national brands.,Vitamins had not been invented.,There were no health claims, at least not federally sanctioned ones.,Fats, carbs, proteins -- they weren't bad or good, they were food.,You ate food.,Hardly anything contained more than one ingredient,,because it was an ingredient.,The cornflake hadn't been invented.,(Laughter),The Pop-Tart, the Pringle, Cheez Whiz, none of that stuff.,Goldfish swam.,(Laughter),It's hard to imagine. People grew food, and they ate food.,And again, everyone ate local.,In New York, an orange was a common Christmas present,,because it came all the way from Florida.,From the '30s on, road systems expanded,,trucks took the place of railroads,,fresh food began to travel more.,Oranges became common in New York.,The South and West became agricultural hubs,,and in other parts of the country, suburbs took over farmland.,The effects of this are well known. They are everywhere.,And the death of family farms is part of this puzzle,,as is almost everything,from the demise of the real community,to the challenge of finding a good tomato, even in summer.,Eventually, California produced too much food to ship fresh,,so it became critical to market canned and frozen foods.,Thus arrived convenience.,It was sold to proto-feminist housewives,as a way to cut down on housework. 
 Now, I know everybody over the age of, like 45 --,their mouths are watering at this point.,(Laughter),(Applause),If we had a slide of Salisbury steak, even more so, right?,(Laughter),But this may have cut down on housework,,but it cut down on the variety of food we ate as well.,Many of us grew up never eating a fresh vegetable,except the occasional raw carrot or maybe an odd lettuce salad.,I, for one -- and I'm not kidding --,didn't eat real spinach or broccoli till I was 19.,Who needed it though? Meat was everywhere.,What could be easier, more filling or healthier for your family,than broiling a steak?,But by then cattle were already raised unnaturally.,Rather than spending their lives eating grass,,for which their stomachs were designed,,they were forced to eat soy and corn.,They have trouble digesting those grains, of course,,but that wasn't a problem for producers.,New drugs kept them healthy.,Well, they kept them alive.,Healthy was another story. 
 Thanks to farm subsidies,,the fine collaboration between agribusiness and Congress,,soy, corn and cattle became king.,And chicken soon joined them on the throne.,It was during this period that the cycle of,dietary and planetary destruction began,,the thing we're only realizing just now.,Listen to this,,between 1950 and 2000, the world's population doubled.,Meat consumption increased five-fold.,Now, someone had to eat all that stuff, so we got fast food.,And this took care of the situation resoundingly.,Home cooking remained the norm, but its quality was down the tubes.,There were fewer meals with home-cooked breads, desserts and soups,,because all of them could be bought at any store.,Not that they were any good, but they were there.,Most moms cooked like mine:,a piece of broiled meat, a quickly made salad with bottled dressing,,canned soup, canned fruit salad.,Maybe baked or mashed potatoes,,or perhaps the stupidest food ever, Minute Rice.,For dessert, store-bought ice cream or cookies.,My mom is not here, so I can say this now.,This kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself.,(Laughter) 
 It wasn't all bad.,By the '70s, forward-thinking people,began to recognize the value of local ingredients.,We tended gardens, we became interested in organic food,,we knew or we were vegetarians.,We weren't all hippies, either.,Some of us were eating in good restaurants and learning how to cook well.,Meanwhile, food production had become industrial. Industrial.,Perhaps because it was being produced rationally,,as if it were plastic,,food gained magical or poisonous powers, or both.,Many people became fat-phobic.,Others worshiped broccoli, as if it were God-like.,But mostly they didn't eat broccoli.,Instead they were sold on yogurt,,yogurt being almost as good as broccoli.,Except, in reality, the way the industry sold yogurt,was to convert it to something much more akin to ice cream.,Similarly, let's look at a granola bar.,You think that that might be healthy food,,but in fact, if you look at the ingredient list,,it's closer in form to a Snickers than it is to oatmeal.,Sadly, it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma,,if not actually killed --,the beginning of the heyday of value-added food,,which contained as many soy and corn products,as could be crammed into it. 
 Think of the frozen chicken nugget.,The chicken is fed corn, and then its meat is ground up,,and mixed with more corn products to add bulk and binder,,and then it's fried in corn oil.,All you do is nuke it. What could be better?,And zapped horribly, pathetically.,By the '70s, home cooking was in such a sad state,that the high fat and spice contents of foods,like McNuggets and Hot Pockets --,and we all have our favorites, actually --,made this stuff more appealing than the bland things,that people were serving at home.,At the same time, masses of women were entering the workforce,,and cooking simply wasn't important enough,for men to share the burden.,So now, you've got your pizza nights, you've got your microwave nights,,you've got your grazing nights,,you've got your fend-for-yourself nights and so on. 
 Leading the way -- what's leading the way?,Meat, junk food, cheese:,the very stuff that will kill you.,So, now we clamor for organic food.,That's good.,And as evidence that things can actually change,,you can now find organic food in supermarkets,,and even in fast-food outlets.,But organic food isn't the answer either,,at least not the way it's currently defined.,Let me pose you a question.,Can farm-raised salmon be organic,,when its feed has nothing to do with its natural diet,,even if the feed itself is supposedly organic, and the fish themselves,are packed tightly in pens, swimming in their own filth?,And if that salmon's from Chile, and it's killed down there,and then flown 5,000 miles, whatever,,dumping how much carbon into the atmosphere?,I don't know.,Packed in Styrofoam, of course,,before landing somewhere in the United States,,and then being trucked a few hundred more miles.,This may be organic in letter, but it's surely not organic in spirit.,Now here is where we all meet.,The locavores, the organivores, the vegetarians,,the vegans, the gourmets,and those of us who are just plain interested in good food.,Even though we've come to this from different points,,we all have to act on our knowledge,to change the way that everyone thinks about food. 
 We need to start acting.,And this is not only an issue of social justice, as Ann Cooper said --,and, of course, she's completely right --,but it's also one of global survival.,Which bring me full circle and points directly to the core issue,,the overproduction and overconsumption of meat and junk food.,As I said, 18 percent of greenhouse gases,are attributed to livestock production.,How much livestock do you need to produce this?,70 percent of the agricultural land on Earth,,30 percent of the Earth's land surface is directly or indirectly devoted,to raising the animals we'll eat.,And this amount is predicted to double in the next 40 years or so. 
 And if the numbers coming in from China,are anything like what they look like now,,it's not going to be 40 years.,There is no good reason for eating as much meat as we do.,And I say this as a man who has eaten a fair share of corned beef in his life.,The most common argument is that we need nutrients --,even though we eat, on average, twice as much protein,as even the industry-obsessed USDA recommends.,But listen: experts who are serious about disease reduction,recommend that adults eat just over half a pound of meat per week. 
 What do you think we eat per day? Half a pound.,But don't we need meat to be big and strong?,Isn't meat eating essential to health?,Won't a diet heavy in fruit and vegetables,turn us into godless, sissy, liberals?,(Laughter),Some of us might think that would be a good thing.,But, no, even if we were all steroid-filled football players,,the answer is no.,In fact, there's no diet on Earth that meets,basic nutritional needs that won't promote growth,,and many will make you much healthier than ours does.,We don't eat animal products for sufficient nutrition,,we eat them to have an odd form of malnutrition, and it's killing us.,To suggest that in the interests of personal and human health,Americans eat 50 percent less meat --,it's not enough of a cut, but it's a start. 
 It would seem absurd, but that's exactly what should happen,,and what progressive people, forward-thinking people,should be doing and advocating,,along with the corresponding increase in the consumption of plants.,I've been writing about food more or less omnivorously --,one might say indiscriminately -- for about 30 years.,During that time, I've eaten,and recommended eating just about everything.,I'll never stop eating animals, I'm sure,,but I do think that for the benefit of everyone,,the time has come to stop raising them industrially,and stop eating them thoughtlessly. 
 Ann Cooper's right.,The USDA is not our ally here.,We have to take matters into our own hands,,not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone --,and that's the hard part -- but by improving our own.,And that happens to be quite easy.,Less meat, less junk, more plants.,It's a simple formula: eat food.,Eat real food.,We can continue to enjoy our food, and we continue to eat well,,and we can eat even better.,We can continue the search for the ingredients we love,,and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals.,We'll reduce not only calories, but our carbon footprint.,We can make food more important, not less,,and save ourselves by doing so.,We have to choose that path.,Thank you.Most people don't know that when I went to high school in this country --,I applied for university at a time when I was convinced,I was going to be an artist and be a sculptor.,And I came from a very privileged background. I was very lucky.,My family was wealthy, and my father believed in one thing,,and that was to give us all as much education as we wanted.,And I announced I wanted to be a sculptor in Paris.,And he was a clever man. He sort of said,,"Well, that's OK, but you've done very well in your math SATs.",In fact, I'd got an 800. And he thought I did very well -- and I did, too -- in the arts:,this was my passion.,And he said "If you go to MIT," to which I had been given early admission,,"I will pay for every year you're at MIT,,in graduate or undergraduate -- as much as you want --,I will pay for an equal number of years for you to live in Paris.",And I thought that was the best deal in town, so I accepted it immediately.,And I decided that if I was good in art, and I was good in mathematics,,I'd study architecture, which was the blending of the two. 
 I went and told my headmaster that, at prep school.,And I said to him what I was doing, that I was going to go study architecture,because it was art and mathematics put together.,He said to me something that just went completely over my head.,He said, "You know, I like grey suits, and I like pin-striped suits,,but I don't like grey pin-striped suits.",And I thought, "What a turkey this guy is," and I went off to MIT.,I studied architecture, then did a second degree in architecture,,and then actually quickly realized that it wasn't architecture.,That really, the mixing of art and science was computers,,and that that really was the place to bring both, and enjoyed a career doing that. 
 And probably, if I were to fill out Jim Citrin's scale,,I'd put 100 percent on the side of the equation,where you spend time making it possible for others to be creative.,And after doing this for a long time, and the Media Lab passing the baton on,,I thought, "Well, maybe it's time for me to do a project.,Something that would be important, but also something,that would take advantage of all of these privileges that one had.",And in the case of the Media Lab, knowing a lot of people,,knowing people who were either executives or wealthy,,and also not having, in my own case, a career to worry about anymore.,My career, I mean, I'd done my career.,Didn't have to worry about earning money.,Didn't have to worry about what people thought about me.,And I said, "Boy, let's really do something that takes advantage of all these features,",and thought that if we could address education, by leveraging the children,,and bringing to the world the access of the computers,,that that was really the thing we should do.,Never shown this picture before, and probably going to be sued for it.,It's taken at three o'clock in the morning, without the permission of the company.,It's about two weeks old. There they are, folks. 
 (Applause) 
 If you look at the picture, you'll see they're stacked up.,Those are conveyor belts that go around.,This is one of the conveyor belts with the thing going by,,but then you'll see the ones up above.,What happens is, they burn into flash memory the software,,and then test them for a few hours.,But you've got to have the thing moving on the assembly line, because it's constant.,So they go around in this loop, which is why you see them up there.,So this was great for us because it was a real turning point. But it goes back.,This picture was taken in 1982, just before the IBM PC was even announced.,Seymour Papert and I were bringing computers to schools,and developing nations at a time when it was way ahead of itself.,But one thing we learned was that these kids can absolutely jump into it,just the same way as our kids do here. 
 And when people tell me, "Who's going to teach the teachers to teach the kids?",I say to myself, "What planet do you come from?",Okay, there's not a person in this room -- I don't care how techie you are --,there's not a person in this room that doesn't give their laptop or cell phone to a kid,to help them debug it. OK?,We all need help, even those of us who are very seasoned.,This picture of Seymour -- 25 years ago. Seymour made a very simple,observation in 1968, and then basically presented it in 1970 --,April 11 to be precise -- called "Teaching Children Thinking.",What he observed was that kids who write computer programs,understand things differently, and when they debug the programs,,they come the closest to learning about learning.,That was very important, and in some sense, we've lost that.,Kids don't program enough and boy,,if there's anything I hope this brings back, it's programming to kids. 
 It's really important. Using applications is OK,,but programming is absolutely fundamental.,This is being launched with three languages in it: Squeak, Logo, and,a third, that I've never even seen before.,The point being, this is going to be very, very intensive on the programming side.,This photograph is very important because it's much later.,This is in the early 2000s. My son, Dimitri -- who's here,,many of you know Dimitri -- went to Cambodia, set up this school,that we had built, just as the school connected it to the Internet.,And these kids had their laptops. But it was really what spirited this,,plus the influence of Joe and others. We started One Laptop per Child.,This is the same village in Cambodia, just a couple of months ago.,These kids are real pros. There were just 7,000 machines out there,being tested by kids. Being a nonprofit is absolutely fundamental. 
 Everybody advised me not to be a nonprofit, but they were all wrong.,And the reason being a nonprofit is important is actually twofold.,There are many reasons, but the two that merit the little bit of time is:,one, the clarity of purpose is there. The moral purpose is clear.,I can see any head of state, any executive I want, at any time, because,I'm not selling laptops. OK? I have no shareholders.,Whether we sell, it doesn't make any difference whatsoever.,The clarity of purpose is absolutely critical. And the second is very counterintuitive --,you can get the best people in the world.,If you look at our professional services, including search firms,,including communications, including legal services, including banking,,they're all pro bono. And it's not to save money.,We've got money in the bank. It's because you get the best people.,You get the people who are doing it because they believe in the mission,,and they're the best people. 
 We couldn't afford to hire a CFO. We put out a job description for a CFO at zero salary,,and we had a queue of people.,It allows you to team up with people. The U.N.'s not going to be,our partner if we're profit making. So announcing this with Kofi Annan,was very important, and the U.N. allowed us,to basically reach all the countries. And this was the machine we were showing,before I met Yves Behar.,And while this machine in some sense is silly,,in retrospect, it actually served a very important purpose.,That pencil-yellow crank was remembered by everybody.,Everybody remembered the pencil-yellow crank. It's different.,It was getting its power in a different way. It's kind of childlike.,Even though this wasn't the direction we went because the crank --,it really is stupid to have it on board, by the way.,In spite of what some people in the press don't get it, didn't understand it,,we didn't take it off because we didn't want to do --,having it on the laptop itself is really not what you want.,You want a separate thing, like the AC adaptor.,I didn't bring one with me, but they really work much better off-board.,And then, I could tell you lots about the laptop, but I decided on just four things. 
 Just keep in mind -- because there are other people, including Bill Gates,,who said, "Gee, you've got a real computer.",That computer is unlike anything you've had, and does things --,there are four of them --,that you don't come close to. And it's very important to be low power,,and I hope that's picked up more by the industry.,That the reason that you want to be below two watts is,that's roughly what you can generate with your upper body.,Dual-mode display -- that sunlight display's fantastic.,We were using it at lunch today in the sunlight, and the more sunlight the better.,And that was really critical. The mesh network, it'll become commonplace.,And of course, "rugged" goes without saying.,And the reason I think design matters isn't because I wanted to go to art school. 
 And by the way, when I graduated from MIT,,I thought the worst and silliest thing to do would be to go to Paris for six years. (Laughter),So, I didn't do that. But design matters for a number of reasons.,The most important being that it is the best way to make an inexpensive product.,Most people make inexpensive products by taking cheap design,,cheap labor, cheap components, and making a cheap laptop.,And, in English, the word "cheap" has,a double meaning, which is really appropriate,,because it's cheap, in the pejorative sense, as well as inexpensive.,But if you take a different approach, and you think of very large-scale integration,,very advanced materials, very advanced manufacturing --,so you're pouring chemicals in one end, iPods are spewing out the other --,and really cool design, that's what we wanted to do. 
 And I can race through these and save a lot of time because,Yves and I obviously didn't compare notes.,These are his slides, and so I don't have to talk about them.,But it was really, to us, very important as a strategy.,It wasn't just to kind of make it cute, because somebody --,you know, good design is very important.,Yves showed one of the power-generating devices.,The mesh network, the reason I -- and I won't go into it in great detail --,but when we deliver laptops to kids in the remotest and poorest parts of the world,,they're connected. There's not just laptops.,And so, we have to drop in satellite dishes. We put in generators.,It's a lot of stuff that goes behind these. These can talk to each other.,If you're in a desert, they can talk to each other about two kilometers apart.,If you're in the jungle, it's about 500 meters. So if a kid bicycles home,,or walks a few miles, they're going to be off the grid, so to speak.,They're not going to be near another laptop,,so you have to nail these onto a tree, and sort of, get it. 
 You don't call Verizon or Sprint. You build your own network.,And that's very important, the user interface.,We are launching with 18 keyboards. English is by far the minority.,Latin is relatively rare, too. You just look at some of the languages.,I'm willing to suspect some of you hadn't even heard of them before.,Is there anybody in the room, one person, unless you work with OLPC,,is there anybody in the room that can tell me what language,the keyboard is that's on the screen? There's only one hand -- so you get it.,Yes, you're right. He's right. It's Amharic,,it's Ethiopian. In Ethiopia, there's never been a keyboard.,There is no keyboard standard because there's no market.,And this is the big difference. 
 Again, when you're a nonprofit, you look at children as a mission, not as a market.,So we went to Ethiopia, and we helped them make a keyboard.,And this will become the standard Ethiopian keyboard.,So what I want to end with is sort of what we're doing to roll it out.,And we changed strategy completely. I decided at the beginning --,it was a pretty good thing to decide in the beginning,,it's not what we're doing now -- is to go to six countries.,Big countries, one of them is not so big, but it's rich.,Here's the six. We went to the six,,and in each case the head of state said he would do it, he'd do a million.,In the case of Gaddafi, he'd do 1.2 million, and that they would launch it.,We thought, this is exactly the right strategy, get it out,,and then the little countries could sort of piggyback on these big countries. 
 And so I went to each of those countries,at least six times, met with the head of state probably two or three times.,In each case, got the ministers, went through a lot of the stuff.,This was a period in my life where I was traveling 330 days per year.,Not something you'd envy or want to do.,In the case of Libya, it was a lot of fun meeting Gaddafi in his tent.,The camel smells were unbelievable.,And it was 45 degrees C. I mean, this was not,what you'd call a cool experience. And former countries --,I say former, because none of them really came through this summer --,there was a big difference between getting a head of state,to have a photo opportunity, make a press release.,So we went to smaller ones. Uruguay, bless their hearts.,Small country, not so rich. President said he'd do it, and guess what?,He did do it. The tender had nothing in it that related to us,,nothing specific about sunlight-readable, mesh-network, low-power,,but just a vanilla laptop proposal.,And guess what? We won it hands down.,When it was announced that they were going to do every child in Uruguay,,the first 100,000, boom, went to OLPC.,The next day -- the next day, not even 24 hours had passed -- in Peru,,the president of Peru said, "We'll do 250." And boom, a little domino effect. 
 The president of Rwanda stepped in and said he would do it.,The president of Ethiopia said he would do it.,And boom, boom, boom. The president of Mongolia.,And so what happens is, these things start to happen with these countries --,still not enough.,Add up all those countries, it didn't quite get to thing, so we said,,"Let's start a program in the United States." So, end of August, early September,,we decide to do this. We announced it near the middle, end --,just when the Clinton Initiative was taking place.,We thought that was a good time to announce it.,Launched it on the 12 of November.,We said it would be just for a short period until the 26. We've extended it until the 31.,And the "Give One, Get One" program is really important because,it got a lot of people absolutely interested. 
 The first day it was just wild. And then we said,,"Well, let's get people to give many. Not just one, and get one,,but maybe give 100, give 1,000." And that's where you come in.,And that's where I think it's very important. I don't want you all to go out and,buy 400 dollars worth of laptops. Okay? Do it, but that's not going to help. Okay?,If everybody in this room goes out tonight and orders one of these things for 400 dollars,,whatever it is, 300 people in the room doing it -- yeah, great.,I want you do something else.,And it's not to go out and buy 100 or 1,000, though,,I invite you to do that, and 10,000 would be even better. 
 Tell people about it! It's got to become viral, OK?,Use your mailing lists. People in this room have extraordinary mailing lists.,Get your friends to give one, get one.,And if each one of you sends it to 300 or 400 people, that would be fantastic.,I won't dwell on the pricing at all.,Just to say that when you do the "Give One, Get One,",a lot of press is a bit about, "They didn't make it, it's 188 dollars, it's not 100.",It will be 100 in two years. It will go below 100.,We've pledged not to add features, but to bring that price down.,But it was the countries that wanted it to go up, and,we let them push it up for all sorts of reasons. So what you can do --,I've just said it. Don't just give one, get one. 
 I just want to end with one last one. This one is not even,24-hours old, or maybe it's 24-hours.,The first kids got their laptops. They got them by ship,,and I'm talking now about 7,000, 8,000 at a time went out this week.,They went to Uruguay, Peru, Mexico.,And it's been slow coming, and we're only making about 5,000 a week,,but we hope, we hope, sometime in next year,,maybe by the middle of the year,,to hit a million a month. Now put that number,,and a million isn't so much. It's not a big number.,We're selling a billion cell phones worldwide this year.,But a million a month in laptop-land is a big number.,And the world production today, everybody combined, making laptops,,is five million a month. So I'm standing here telling you that sometime next year,,we're going to make 20 percent of the world production.,And if we do that, there are going to be a lot of lucky kids out there.,And we hope if you have EG two years from now,,or whenever you have it again,,I won't have bad breath, and I will be invited back,,and will have, hopefully by then, maybe 100 million out there to children.,Thank you. 
 (Applause)I dabble in design. I'm a curator of architecture and design;,I happen to be at the Museum of Modern Art.,But what we're going to talk about today,is really design. Really good designers are like sponges:,they really are curious,and absorb every kind of information that comes their way,,and transform it so that it can be used by people like us.,And so that gives me an opportunity,,because every design show that I curate,kind of looks at a different world. And it's great,,because it seems like every time I change jobs. 
 And what I'm going to do today is I'm going to give you a preview,of the next exhibition that I'm working on, which is called,"Design and the Elastic Mind.",The world that I decided to focus on this particular time,is the world of science and the world of technology.,Technology always comes into play when design is involved,,but science does a little less.,But designers are great at taking big revolutions that happen,and transforming them so that we can use them.,And this is what this exhibition looks at. 
 If you think about your life today,,you go every day through many different scales,,many different changes of rhythm and pace.,You work over different time zones, you talk to very different people,,you multitask. We all know it, and we do it kind of automatically.,Some of the minds in this audience are super elastic,,others are a little slower,,others have a few stretch marks, but nonetheless,this is a quite exceptional audience from that viewpoint.,Other people are not as elastic.,I can't get my father in Italy to work on the Internet.,He doesn't want to put high-speed Internet at home.,And that's because there's some little bit of fear,,little bit of resistance or just clogged mechanisms.,So designers work on this particular malaise that we have,,these kinds of discomforts that we have,,and try to make life easier for us.,Elasticity of mind is something that we really need, you know,,we really need, we really cherish and we really work on.,And this exhibition is about the work of designers,that help us be more elastic,,and also of designers that really work on this elasticity,as an opportunity. And one last thing is that,it's not only designers, but it's also scientists. 
 And before I launch into the display of some of the slides,and into the preview, I would like to point out,this beautiful detail about scientists and design.,You can say that the relationship between science and design,goes back centuries. You can of course talk about,Leonardo da Vinci and many other Renaissance men and women --,and there's a gigantic history behind it.,But according to a really great science historian you might know,,Peter Galison -- he teaches at Harvard --,what nanotechnology in particular and quantum physics,have brought to designers is this renewed interest,,this real passion for design. 
 So basically, the idea of being able to build things bottom up,,atom by atom, has made them all into tinkerers.,And all of a sudden scientists are seeking designers,,just like designers are seeking scientists.,It's a brand-new love affair that we're trying to cultivate,at MOMA. Together with Adam Bly, who is the founder of Seed magazine --,that's now a multimedia company, you might know it --,we founded about a year ago a monthly salon,for designers and scientists, and it's quite beautiful.,And Keith has come, and also Jonathan has come and many others.,And it was great, because at the beginning was this apology fest --,you know, scientists would tell designers,,you know, I don't know what style is, I'm not really elegant.,And designers would like, oh, I don't know how to do an equation,,I don't understand what you're saying. And then all of a sudden,they really started talking each others' language,,and now we're already at the point that they collaborate. 
 Paul Steinhardt, a physicist from New York,,and Aranda/Lasch, architects, collaborated in an installation,in London at the Serpentine.,And it's really interesting to see how this happens.,The exhibition will talk about the work,of both designers and scientists,,and show how they're presenting the possibilities of the future to us.,I'm showing to you,different sections of the show right now,,just to give you a taste of it.,Nanophysics and nanotechnology, for instance,,have really opened the designer's mind.,In this case I'm showing more the designers' work,,because they're the ones that have really been stimulated.,A lot of the objects in the show are concepts,,not objects that exist already. But what you're looking at here,is the work of some scientists from UCLA.,This kind of alphabet soup is a new way to mark proteins --,not only by color but literally by alphabet letters.,So they construct it, and they can construct all kinds of forms 
 at the nanoscale. This is the work of design students,from the Royal College of Arts in London,that have been working together with their tutor, Tony Dunne,,and with a bunch of scientists around Great Britain,on the possibilities of nanotechnology for design in the future.,New sensing elements on the body --,you can grow hairs on your nails,,and therefore grab some of the particles from another person.,They seem very, very obsessed,with finding out more about the ideal mate.,So they're working on enhancing everything: touch, smell --,everything they can, in order to find the perfect mate. 
 Very interesting. This is a typeface designer,from Israel who has designed -- he calls them "typosperma.",He's thinking -- of course it's all a concept --,of injecting typefaces into spermatozoa,,I don't know how to say it in English -- spermatazoi --,in order to make them become -- to almost have a song,or a whole poem written with every ejaculation. (Laughter),I tell you, designers are quite fantastic, you know. 
 So, tissue design.,In this case too, you have a mixture of scientists and designers.,This here is part of the same lab at the Royal College of Arts.,The RCA is really quite an amazing school from that viewpoint.,One of the assignments for a year was to work with in-vitro meat.,You know that already you can grow meat in vitro.,In Australia they did it -- this research company, called SymbioticA.,But the problem is that it's a really ugly patty.,And so, the assignment to the students was,,how should the steak of tomorrow be?,When you don't have to kill cows and it can have any shape,,what should it be like?,So this particular student, James King,,went around the beautiful English countryside,,picked the best, best cow that he could see,,and then put her in the MRI machine.,Then, he took the scans of the best organs and made the meat --,of course, this is done with a Japanese resins food maker,,but you know, in the future it could be made better --,which reproduces the best MRI scan of the best cow he could find. 
 Instead, this element here is much more banal.,Something that you know can be done already,is to grow bone tissue, so that you can make a wedding ring,out of the bone tissue of your loved one -- literally.,So, this is indeed made of human bone tissue. 
 This is SymbioticA, and they've been working --,they were the first ones to do this in-vitro meat --,and now they've also done an in-vitro coat, a leather coat.,It's miniscule, but it's a real coat. It's shaped like one.,So, we'll be able to really not have any excuse,to be wearing everything leather in the future. 
 One of the most important topics of the show -- you know,,as anything in our life today,,we can look at it from many, many different viewpoints,,and at different levels.,One of the most interesting and most important concepts,is the idea of scale. We change scale very often:,we change resolution of screens, and,we're not really fazed by it, we do it very comfortably.,So you go, even in the exhibition,,from the idea of nanotechnology and the nanoscale,to the manipulation of really great amounts of data --,the mapping and tagging of the universe and of the world.,In this particular case a section will be devoted,to information design.,You see here the work of Ben Fry. This is "Human vs. Chimps" --,the few chromosomes that distinguish us from chimps.,It was a beautiful visualization that he did for Seed magazine.,And here's the whole code of Pac-Man, visualized,with all the go-to, go-back-to,,also made into a beautiful choreography. 
 And then also graphs by scientists,,this beautiful diagraph of protein homology.,Scientists are starting to also consider aesthetics.,We were discussing with Keith Shrubb* this morning,the fact that many scientists,tend not to use anything beautiful in their presentations,,otherwise they're afraid of being considered dumb blondes.,So they pick the worst background,from any kind of PowerPoint presentation, the worst typeface.,It's only recently that this kind of marriage,between design and science is producing some of the first "pretty" --,if we can say so -- scientific presentations.,Another aspect of contemporary design,that I think is mind-opening, promising,and will really be the future of design,,is the idea of collective design.,You know, the whole XO laptop, from One Laptop per Child,,is based on the idea of collaboration and mash and networking.,So, the more the merrier.,The more computers, the stronger the signal,,and children work on the interface so that it's all based,on doing things together, tasks together.,So the idea of collective design,is something that will become even bigger in the future,,and this is chosen as an example. 
 Related to the idea of collective design and to the new balance,between the individual and the collectiveness, collectivity,is the idea of existence maximum.,That's a term that I coined a few years ago,while I was thinking of how pressed we are together,,and at the same time how these small objects,,like the Walkman first and then the iPod,,create bubbles of space around us that enable us,to have a metaphysical space,that is much bigger than our physical space.,You can be in the subway and you can be completely isolated,and have your own room in your iPod. 
 And this is the work of several designers,that really enhance the idea of solitude and expansion,by means of various techniques.,This is a spa telephone. The idea is that it's become so difficult,to have a private conversation anywhere,that you go to the spa, you have a massage, you have a facial,,maybe a rub, and then you have this beautiful pool,with this perfect temperature, and you can have,this isolation tank phone conversation,with whomever you've been wanting to talk with for a long time.,And same thing here, Social Tele-presence.,It's actually already used by the military a little bit,,but it's the idea of being able to be somewhere else,with your senses while you're removed from it physically.,And this is called Blind Date. It's a [unclear],,so if you're too shy to be really at the date,,you can stay at a distance with your flowers,and somebody else reenacts the date for you. 
 Rapid manufacturing is another big area,in which technology and design are, I think,,bound to change the world. You've heard about it before many times.,Rapid manufacturing is a computer file,sent directly from the computer to the manufacturing machine.,It used to be called rapid prototyping, rapid modeling.,It started out in the '80s, but at the beginning,it was machines carving out of a foam block,a model that was very, very fragile,,and could not have any real use.,Slowly but surely, the materials became better -- better resins.,Techniques became better -- not only carving,but also stereolithography and laser -- solidifying all kinds of resins,,whether in powder or in liquid form. And the vats became bigger,,to the point that now we can have actual chairs,made by rapid manufacturing.,It takes seven days today to manufacture a chair,,but you know what? One day it will take seven hours.,And then the dream is that you'll be able to, from home,,customize your chair. You know, companies and designers,will be designing the matrix or the margins,that respect both solidity and brand, and design identity.,And then you can send it to the Kinko's store at the corner 
 and go get your chair. Now, the implications of this are enormous,,not only regarding the participation of the final buyer,in the design process, but also no tracking,,no warehousing, no wasted materials.,Also, I can imagine many design manufacturers,will have to retool their own business plans,and maybe invest in this Kinko's store. But it really is a big change.,And here I'm showing a picture that was in Wired Magazine --,you know, the Artifacts of the Future section that I love so much --,that shows you can have your desktop 3D printer,and print your own basketball.,But here instead are examples, you can already 3D-print textiles,,which is very interesting.,This is just a really nice touch -- it's called slow prototyping.,It's a designer that put 10,000 bees at work and they built this vase.,They had a particular shape that they had to stay in. 
 Mapping and tagging.,As the capacity of computers becomes really, really big,,and the capacity of our mind not that much bigger,,we find that we need to tag as much as we can what we do,in order to then retrace our path.,Also, we do it in order to share with other people.,Again, this communal sense of experience,that seems to be so important today.,So, various ways to map and tag,are also the work of many designers nowadays.,Also, the senses -- designers and scientists all work on trying to expand,our senses capabilities so that we can achieve more.,And also animal senses in a way. 
 This particular object that many people love so much,is actually based on kind of a scientific experiment --,the fact that bees have a very strong olfactory sense,,and so -- much like dogs that can smell certain kinds of skin cancer --,bees can be trained by Pavlovian reflex,to detect one type of cancer, and also pregnancy.,And so this student at the RCA,designed this beautiful blown-glass object,where the bees move from one chamber to the other,if they detect that particular smell,that signifies, in this case, pregnancy.,Another shape is made for cancer. 
 Design for Debate is a very interesting new endeavor,that designers have really shaped for themselves.,Some designers don't design objects, products,,things that we're going to actually use,,but rather, they design scenarios that are object-based.,They're still very useful.,They help companies and other designers think better about the future.,And usually they are accompanied by videos.,This is quite beautiful. It's Dunne and Raby, "All the Robots.",Those are a series of robots that are meant to be taken care of.,We always think that robots will take care of us,,and instead they designed these robots that are very, very needy.,You need to take one in your arms and look at it in the eyes,for about five minutes before it does something.,Another one gets really, really nervous if you get in to the room,,and starts shaking, so you have to calm it down.,So it's really a way to make us think more,about what robots mean to us.,Noam Toran and "Accessories for Lonely Men":,the idea is that when you lose your loved one,or you go through a bad breakup,,what you miss the most are those annoying things,that you used to hate when you were with the other person.,So he designed all these series of accessories.,This one is something that takes away the sheets from you at night.,Then there's another one that breathes on your neck.,There's another one that throws plates and breaks them.,So it's just this idea of what we really miss in life. 
 Elio Caccavale: he took the idea,of those dolls that explain leukemia.,He's working on dolls that explain xenotransplantation,,and also the spider gene into the goat, from a few years ago.,He's working for the exhibition on a whole series of dolls,that explain to children where babies come from today.,Because it's not anymore Mom, Dad, the flowers and the bees,,and then there's the baby. No, it can be two moms, three dads,,in-vitro -- there's the whole idea,of how babies can be made today that has changed.,So it's a series of dolls that he's working on right now. 
 One of the most beautiful things,is that designers really work on life,,even though they take technology into account.,And many designers have been working recently,on the idea of death and mourning,,and what we can do about it today with new technologies.,Or how we should behave about it with new technologies.,These three objects over there are hard drives,with a Bluetooth connection. But they're in reality,very, very beautiful sculpted artifacts,that contain the whole desktop and computer memory,of somebody who passed away.,So instead of having only the pictures,,you will be able to put this object next to the computer,and all of a sudden have, you know,,Gertrude's whole life and all of her files,and her address book come alive. 
 And this is even better. This is Auger-Loizeau, "AfterLife.",It's the idea that some people don't believe in an afterlife.,So to give them something tangible that shows that,there is something after death, they take the gastric juices,of people who passed away and concentrate them,,and put them into a battery that can actually be used,to power flashlights. They also go -- you know, sex toys, whatever.,It's quite amazing how these things can make you smile,,can make you laugh, can make you cry sometimes.,But I'm hoping that this particular exhibition,will be able to trace a new portrait of where design is going --,which is always, hopefully, a portrait a few years in advance,of where the world is going.,Thank you very much.Well, good morning.,You know, the computer and television both recently turned 60,,and today I'd like to talk about their relationship.,Despite their middle age, if you've been following the themes,of this conference or the entertainment industry,,it's pretty clear that one has been picking on the other.,So it's about time that we talked about how the computer ambushed television,,or why the invention of the atomic bomb,unleashed forces that lead to the writers' strike.,And it's not just what these are doing to each other,,but it's what the audience thinks that really frames this matter. 
 To get a sense of this,,and it's been a theme we've talked about all week,,I recently talked to a bunch of tweeners.,I wrote on cards: "television," "radio," "MySpace," "Internet," "PC.",And I said, just arrange these, from what's important to you,and what's not, and then tell me why.,Let's listen to what happens when they get to the portion,of the discussion on television. 
 (Video) Girl 1: Well, I think it's important but, like, not necessary,because you can do a lot of other stuff with your free time than watch programs. 
 Peter Hirshberg: Which is more fun, Internet or TV? 
 Girls: Internet.,Girl 2: I think we -- the reasons, one of the reasons we put computer before TV,is because nowadays, like, we have TV shows on the computer.,(Girl 3: Oh, yeah.),Girl 2: And then you can download onto your iPod. 
 PH: Would you like to be the president of a TV network? 
 Girl 4: I wouldn't like it.,Girl 2: That would be so stressful.,Girl 5: No. 
 PH: How come? 
 Girl 5: Because they're going to lose all their money eventually.,Girl 3: Like the stock market, it goes up and down and stuff.,I think right now the computers will be at the top,and everything will be kind of going down and stuff. 
 PH: There's been an uneasy relationship between the TV business,and the tech business, really ever since they both turned about 30.,We go through periods of enthrallment,,followed by reactions in boardrooms, in the finance community,best characterized as, what's the finance term? Ick pooey. 
 Let me give you an example of this. The year is 1976,,and Warner buys Atari because video games are on the rise.,The next year they march forward and they introduce Qube,,the first interactive cable TV system,,and the New York Times heralds this,as telecommunications moving to the home,,convergence, great things are happening.,Everybody in the East Coast gets in the pictures --,Citicorp, Penney, RCA -- all getting into this big vision.,By the way, this is about when I enter the picture.,I'm going to do a summer internship at Time Warner.,That summer I'm all -- I'm at Warner that summer --,I'm all excited to work on convergence, and then the bottom falls out.,Doesn't work out too well for them, they lose money.,And I had a happy brush with convergence,until, kind of, Warner basically has to liquidate the whole thing. 
 That's when I leave graduate school, and I can't work in New York,on kind of entertainment and technology,because I have to be exiled to California, where the remaining jobs are,,almost to the sea, to go to work for Apple Computer.,Warner, of course, writes off more than 400 million dollars.,Four hundred million dollars, which was real money back in the '70s.,But they were onto something and they got better at it.,By the year 2000, the process was perfected. They merged with AOL,,and in just four years, managed to shed about 200 billion dollars,of market capitalization, showing that they'd actually mastered the art,of applying Moore's law of successive miniaturization,to their balance sheet. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, I think that one reason that the media and the entertainment communities,,or the media community, is driven so crazy by the tech community,is that tech folks talk differently.,You know, for 50 years, we've talked about changing the world,,about total transformation.,For 50 years, it's been about hopes and fears,and promises of a better world. And I got to thinking,,you know, who else talks that way?,And the answer is pretty clearly --,it's people in religion and in politics. 
 And so I realized that actually the tech world is best understood,,not as a business cycle, but as a messianic movement.,We promise something great, we evangelize it,,we're going to change the world. It doesn't work out too well,,and so we actually go back to the well and start all over again,,as the people in New York and L.A. look on in absolute, morbid astonishment.,But it's this irrational view of things that drives us on to the next thing. 
 So, what I'd like to ask is, if the computer is becoming a principal tool,of media and entertainment, how did we get here?,I mean, how did a machine that was built for accounting,and artillery morph into media? 
 Of course, the first computer was built just after World War II,to solve military problems, but things got really interesting,just a couple of years later -- 1949 with Whirlwind,,built at MIT's Lincoln Lab. Jay Forrester was building this for the Navy,,but you can't help but see that the creator of this machine had in mind,a machine that might actually be a potential media star.,So take a look at what happens when the foremost journalist,of early television meets one of the foremost computer pioneers,,and the computer begins to express itself. 
 (Video) Journalist: It's a Whirlwind electronic computer.,With considerable trepidation,,we undertake to interview this new machine. 
 Jay Forrester: Hello New York, this is Cambridge.,And this is the oscilloscope of the Whirlwind electronic computer.,Would you like if I used the machine? 
 Journalist: Yes, of course. But I have an idea, Mr. Forrester.,Since this computer was made,in conjunction with the Office of Naval Research,,why don't we switch down to the Pentagon in Washington,and let the Navy's research chief, Admiral Bolster,,give Whirlwind the workout? 
 Calvin Bolster: Well, Ed, this problem concerns the Navy's Viking rocket.,This rocket goes up 135 miles into the sky.,Now, at the standard rate of fuel consumption,,I would like to see the computer trace the flight path of this rocket,and see how it can determine, at any instant,,say at the end of 40 seconds, the amount of fuel remaining,,and the velocity at that set instant.,JF: Over on the left-hand side,,you will notice fuel consumption decreasing as the rocket takes off.,And on the right-hand side, there's a scale,that shows the rocket's velocity.,The rocket's position is shown by the trajectory,that we're now looking at.,And as it reaches the peak of its trajectory,,the velocity, you will notice, has dropped off to a minimum.,Then, as the rocket dives down, velocity picks up again,toward a maximum velocity and the rocket hits the ground. 
 How's that?,Journalist: What about that, Admiral?,CB: Looks very good to me. 
 JF: And before leaving, we would like to show you another kind of,mathematical problem that some of the boys have worked out,in their spare time, in a less serious vein, for a Sunday afternoon. (Music) 
 Journalist: Thank you very much indeed, Mr. Forrester and the MIT lab. 
 PH: You know, so much was worked out: the first real-time interaction,,the video display, pointing a gun. It lead to the microcomputer,,but unfortunately, it was too pricey for the Navy,,and all of this would have been lost,if it weren't for a happy coincidence. 
 Enter the atomic bomb.,We're threatened by the greatest weapon ever,,and knowing a good thing when it sees it,,the Air Force decides it needs the biggest computer ever to protect us.,They adapt Whirlwind to a massive air defense system,,deploy it all across the frozen north,,and spend nearly three times as much on this computer,as was spent on the Manhattan Project,building the A-Bomb in the first place.,Talk about a shot in the arm for the computer industry.,And you can imagine that the Air Force became a pretty good salesman.,Here's their marketing video. 
 (Video) Narrator: In a mass raid, high-speed bombers could be in on us,before we could determine their tracks.,And then it would be too late to act.,We cannot afford to take that chance.,It is to meet this threat that the Air Force has been developing SAGE,,the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment system,,to strengthen our air defenses.,This new computer, built to become the nerve center of a defense network,,is able to perform all the complex mathematical problems,involved in countering a mass enemy raid.,It is provided with its own powerhouse,containing large diesel-driven generators,,air-conditioning equipment, and cooling towers,required to cool the thousands of vacuum tubes in the computer. 
 PH: You know, that one computer was huge.,There's an interesting marketing lesson from it,,which is basically, when you market a product,,you can either say, this is going to be wonderful,,it will make you feel better and enliven you.,Or there's one other marketing proposition: if you don't use our product, you'll die.,This is a really good example of that. 
 This had the first pointing device. It was distributed,,so it worked out -- distributed computing and modems --,so all these things could talk to each other.,About 20 percent of all the nation's programmers were wrapped up in this thing,,and it led to an awful lot of what we have today. It also used vacuum tubes.,You saw how huge it was, and to give you a sense for this --,because we've talked a lot about Moore's law and making things small,at this conference, so let's talk about making things large.,If we took Whirlwind and put it in a place that you all know,,say, Century City, it would fit beautifully.,You'd kind of have to take Century City out, but it could fit in there. 
 But like, let's imagine we took the latest Pentium processor,,the latest Core 2 Extreme, which is a four-core processor,that Intel's working on, it will be our laptop tomorrow.,To build that, what we'd do with Whirlwind technology is,we'd have to take up roughly from the 10 to Mulholland,,and from the 405 to La Cienega just with those Whirlwinds.,And then, the 92 nuclear power plants,that it would take to provide the power,would fill up the rest of Los Angeles.,That's roughly a third more nuclear power than all of France creates.,So, the next time they tell you they're on to something, clearly they're not.,So -- and we haven't even worked out the cooling needs.,But it gives you the kind of power that people have, that the audience has,,and the reasons these transformations are happening. 
 All of this stuff starts moving into industry.,DEC kind of reduces all this and makes the first mini-computer.,It shows up at places like MIT, and then a mutation happens.,Spacewar! is built, the first computer game, and all of a sudden,,interactivity and involvement and passion is worked out.,Actually, many MIT students stayed up all night long working on this thing,,and many of the principles of gaming today were worked out.,DEC knew a good thing about wasting time.,It shipped every one of its computers with that game. 
 Meanwhile, as all of this is happening, by the mid-'50s,,the business model of traditional broadcasting and cinema,has been busted completely.,A new technology has confounded radio men and movie moguls,and they're quite certain that television is about to do them in.,In fact, despair is in the air.,And a quote that sounds largely reminiscent,from everything I've been reading all week.,RCA had David Sarnoff, who basically commercialized radio,,said this, "I don't say that radio networks must die.,Every effort has been made and will continue to be made,to find a new pattern, new selling arrangements,and new types of programs that may arrest the declining revenues.,It may yet be possible to eke out a poor existence for radio,,but I don't know how.",And of course, as the computer industry develops interactively,,producers in the emerging TV business actually hit on the same idea.,And they fake it. 
 (Video) Jack Berry: Boys and girls, I think you all know how to get your magic windows,up on the set, you just get them out.,First of all, get your Winky Dink kits out.,Put out your Magic Window and your erasing glove, and rub it like this.,That's the way we get some of the magic into it, boys and girls.,Then take it and put it right up against the screen of your own television set,,and rub it out from the center to the corners, like this.,Make sure you keep your magic crayons handy, your Winky Dink crayons,and your erasing glove,,because you'll be using them during the show to draw like that.,You all set? OK, let's get right to the first story about Dusty Man.,Come on into the secret lab. 
 PH: It was the dawn of interactive TV, and you may have noticed,they wanted to sell you the Winky Dink kits.,Those are the Winky Dink crayons. I know what you're saying.,"Pete, I could use any ordinary open-source crayon,,why do I have to buy theirs?",I assure you, that's not the case.,Turns out they told us directly that these are the only crayons,you should ever use with your Winky Dink Magic Window,,other crayons may discolor or hurt the window.,This proprietary principle of vendor lock-in,would go on to be perfected with great success,as one of the enduring principles of windowing systems everywhere.,It led to lawsuits -- 
 (Laughter) -- 
 federal investigations, and lots of repercussions,,and that's a scandal we won't discuss today. 
 But we will discuss this scandal, because this man, Jack Berry, the host of "Winky Dink,",went on to become the host of "Twenty One," one of the most important quiz shows ever.,And it was rigged, and it became unraveled when this man,,Charles van Doren, was outed after an unnatural winning streak,,ending Berry's career.,And actually, ending the career of a lot of people at CBS.,It turns out there was a lot to learn,about how this new medium worked. 
 And 50 years ago, if you'd been at a meeting like this,and were trying to understand the media,,there was one prophet and only but one you wanted to hear from,,Professor Marshall McLuhan.,He actually understood something about a theme,that we've been discussing all week. It's the role of the audience,in an era of pervasive electronic communications.,Here he is talking from the 1960s. 
 (Video) Marshall McLuhan: If the audience can become involved in the actual process,of making the ad, then it's happy. It's like the old quiz shows.,They were great TV because it gave the audience a role, something to do.,They were horrified when they discovered,they'd really been left out all the time because the shows were rigged.,Now, then, this was a horrible misunderstanding of TV,on the part of the programmers. 
 PH: You know, McLuhan talked about the global village.,If you substitute the word blogosphere, of the Internet today,,it is very true that his understanding is probably,very enlightening now. Let's listen in to him. 
 (Video) MM: The global village is a world,in which you don't necessarily have harmony.,You have extreme concern with everybody else's business,and much involvement in everybody else's life.,It's a sort of Ann Landers' column writ large.,And it doesn't necessarily mean harmony and peace and quiet,,but it does mean huge involvement in everybody else's affairs.,And so the global village is as big as a planet,,and as small as a village post office. 
 PH: We'll talk a little bit more about him later.,We're now right into the 1960s.,It's the era of big business and data centers for computing.,But all that was about to change.,You know, the expression of technology,reflects the people and the time of the culture it was built in.,And when I say that code expresses our hopes and aspirations,,it's not just a joke about messianism, it's actually what we do.,But for this part of the story, I'd actually like to throw it,to America's leading technology correspondent, John Markoff. 
 (Video) John Markoff: Do you want to know what the counterculture,in drugs, sex, rock 'n' roll and the anti-war movement,had to do with computing? Everything.,It all happened within five miles of where I'm standing,,at Stanford University, between 1960 and 1975.,In the midst of revolution in the streets,and rock and roll concerts in the parks,,a group of researchers led by people like John McCarthy,,a computer scientist at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab,,and Doug Engelbart, a computer scientist at SRI, changed the world.,Engelbart came out of a pretty dry engineering culture,,but while he was beginning to do his work,,all of this stuff was bubbling on the mid-peninsula.,There was LSD leaking out of Kesey's Veterans' Hospital experiments,and other areas around the campus,,and there was music literally in the streets.,The Grateful Dead was playing in the pizza parlors.,People were leaving to go back to the land.,There was the Vietnam War. There was black liberation.,There was women's liberation.,This was a remarkable place, at a remarkable time.,And into that ferment came the microprocessor. 
 I think it was that interaction that led to personal computing.,They saw these tools that were controlled by the establishment,as ones that could actually be liberated and put to use,by these communities that they were trying to build.,And most importantly, they had this ethos of sharing information.,I think these ideas are difficult to understand,,because when you're trapped in one paradigm,,the next paradigm is always like a science fiction universe -- it makes no sense.,The stories were so compelling that I decided to write a book about them.,The title of the book is, "What the Dormouse Said:,How the '60s Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry.",The title was taken from the lyrics,to a Jefferson Airplane song. The lyrics go,,"Remember what the dormouse said.,Feed your head, feed your head, feed your head." (Music) 
 PH: By this time, computing had kind of leapt into media territory,,and in short order much of what we're doing today was imagined,in Cambridge and Silicon Valley.,Here's the Architecture Machine Group,,the predecessor of the Media Lab, in 1981.,Meanwhile, in California, we were trying to commercialize a lot of this stuff.,HyperCard was the first program,to introduce the public to hyperlinks,,where you could randomly hook to any kind of picture,,or piece of text, or data across a file system,,and we had no way of explaining it.,There was no metaphor. Was it a database?,A prototyping tool? A scripted language?,Heck, it was everything. So we ended up writing a marketing brochure. 
 We asked a question about how the mind works,,and we let our customers play the role of so many blind men filling out the elephant.,A few years later, we then hit on the idea,of explaining to people the secret of, how do you get the content you want,,the way you want it and the easy way?,Here's the Apple marketing video. 
 (Video) James Burke: You'll be pleased to know, I'm sure, that there are several ways,to create a HyperCard interactive video.,The most involved method is to go ahead,and produce your own videodisc,as well as build your own HyperCard stacks.,By far the simplest method is to buy a pre-made videodisc,and HyperCard stacks from a commercial supplier.,The method we illustrate in this video,uses a pre-made videodisc but creates custom HyperCard stacks.,This method allows you to use existing videodisc materials,in ways which suit your specific needs and interests. 
 PH: I hope you realize how subversive that is.,That's like a Dick Cheney speech.,You think he's a nice balding guy, but he's just declared war,on the content business. Find the commercial stuff,,mash it up, tell the story your way.,Now, as long as we confine this to the education market,,and a personal matter between the computer and the file system,,that's fine, but as you can see, it was about to leap out and upset Jack Valenti,and a lot of other people. 
 By the way, speaking of the filing system, it never occurred to us,that these hyperlinks could go beyond the local area network.,A few years later, Tim Berners-Lee worked that out.,It became a killer app of links, and today, of course,,we call that the World Wide Web.,Now, not only was I instrumental in helping Apple miss the Internet,,but a couple of years later, I helped Bill Gates do the same thing.,The year is 1993,and he was working on a book and I was working on a video,to help him kind of explain where we were all heading and how to popularize all this.,We were plenty aware that we were messing with media,,and on the surface, it looks like we predicted a lot of the right things,,but we also missed an awful lot. Let's take a look. 
 (Video) Narrator: The pyramids, the Colosseum, the New York subway system,and TV dinners, ancient and modern wonders of the man-made world all.,Yet each pales to insignificance with the completion,of that magnificent accomplishment of twenty-first-century technology,,the Digital Superhighway.,Once it was only a dream of technoids and a few long-forgotten politicians.,The Digital Highway arrived in America's living rooms late in the twentieth century.,Let us recall the pioneers who made this technical marvel possible.,The Digital Highway would follow the rutted trail,first blazed by Alexander Graham Bell.,Though some were incredulous ... Man 1: The phone company!,Narrator: Stirred by the prospects of mass communication,and making big bucks on advertising,,David Sarnoff commercializes radio.,Man 2: Never had scientists been put under such pressure and demand.,Narrator: The medium introduced America to new products.,Voice 1: Say, mom, Windows for Radio means more enjoyment,and greater ease of use for the whole family.,Be sure to enjoy Windows for Radio at home and at work.,Narrator: In 1939, the Radio Corporation of America introduced television.,Man 2: Never had scientists been put under such pressure and demand. 
 Narrator: Eventually, the race to the future took on added momentum,with the breakup of the telephone company.,And further stimulus came,with the deregulation of the cable television industry,,and the re-regulation of the cable television industry.,Ted Turner: We did the work to build this, this cable industry,,now the broadcasters want some of our money. I mean, it's ridiculous.,Narrator: Computers, once the unwieldy tools of accountants and other geeks,,escaped the backrooms to enter the media fracas.,The world and all its culture reduced to bits,,the lingua franca of all media.,And the forces of convergence exploded. 
 Finally, four great industrial sectors combined.,Telecommunications, entertainment, computing and everything else.,Man 3: We'll see channels for the gourmet,and we'll see channels for the pet lover.,Voice 2: Next on the gourmet pet channel,,decorating birthday cakes for your schnauzer.,Narrator: All of industry was in play, as investors flocked to place their bets.,At stake: the battle for you, the consumer,,and the right to spend billions to send a lot of information into the parlors of America. (Music) 
 PH: We missed a lot. You know, you missed, we missed the Internet,,the long tail, the role of the audience, open systems, social networks.,It just goes to show how tough it is to come up with the right uses of media.,Thomas Edison had the same problem.,He wrote a list of what the phonograph might be good for when he invented it,,and kind of only one of his ideas,turned out to have been the right early idea.,Well, you know where we're going on from here.,We come into the era of the dotcom, the World Wide Web,,and I don't need to tell you about that,because we all went through that bubble together.,But when we emerge from this and what we call Web 2.0,,things actually are quite different.,And I think it's the reason that TV's so challenged.,If Internet one was about pages, now it's about people.,It's a customer, it's an audience, it's a person who's participating.,It's the formidable thing that is changing entertainment now. 
 (Video) MM: Because it gave the audience a role, something to do. 
 PH: In my own company, Technorati,,we see something like 67,000 blog posts an hour come in.,That's about 2,700 fresh, connective links,across about 112 million blogs that are out there.,And it's no wonder that as we head into the writers' strike, odd things happen.,You know, it reminds me of that old saw in Hollywood,,that a producer is anyone who knows a writer.,I now think a network boss is anyone who has a cable modem.,But it's not a joke. This is a real headline.,"Websites attract striking writers:,operators of sites like MyDamnChannel.com,could benefit from labor disputes.",Meanwhile, you have the TV bloggers going out on strike,,in sympathy with the television writers.,And then you have TV Guide, a Fox property,,which is about to sponsor the online video awards --,but cancels it out of sympathy with traditional television,,not appearing to gloat.,To show you how schizophrenic this all is,,here's the head of MySpace, or Fox Interactive, a News Corp company,,being asked, well, with the writers' strike,,isn't this going to hurt News Corp and help you online? 
 (Video) Man: But I, yeah, I think there's an opportunity. As the strike continues,,there's an opportunity for more people to experience,video on places like MySpace TV. 
 PH: Oh, but then he remembers he works for Rupert Murdoch. 
 (Video) Man: Yes, well, first, you know, I'm part of News Corporation,as part of Fox Entertainment Group.,Obviously, we hope that the strike is --,that the issues are resolved as quickly as possible. 
 PH: One of the great things that's going on here is,the globalization of content really is happening.,Here is a clip from a video, from a piece of animation,that was written by a writer in Hollywood,,animation worked out in Israel, farmed out to Croatia and India,,and it's now an international series. 
 (Video) Narrator: The following takes place between the minutes of 2:15 p.m. and 2:18 p.m.,,in the months preceding the presidential primaries. 
 Voice 1: You'll have to stay here in the safe house,until we get word the terrorist threat is over. 
 Voice 2: You mean we'll have to live here, together?,Voices 2, 3 and 4: With her?,Voice 2: Well, there goes the neighborhood. 
 PH: The company that created this, Aniboom, is an interesting example,of where this is headed. Traditional TV animation costs, say,,between 80,000 and 10,000 dollars a minute.,They're producing things for between 1,500 and 800 dollars a minute.,And they're offering their creators 30 percent of the back end,,in a much more entrepreneurial manner. So, it's a different model.,What the entertainment business is struggling with,,the world of brands is figuring out. 
 For example, Nike now understands that Nike Plus is not just a device in its shoe,,it's a network to hook its customers together.,And the head of marketing at Nike says, "People are coming to our site,an average of three times a week. We don't have to go to them.",Which means television advertising is down 57 percent for Nike.,Or, as Nike's head of marketing says,,"We're not in the business of keeping media companies alive.,We're in the business of connecting with consumers." 
 And media companies realize the audience is important also.,Here's a man announcing the new Market Watch from Dow Jones,,powered 100 percent by the user experience on the home page --,user-generated content married up with traditional content.,It turns out you have a bigger audience and more interest if you hook up with them.,Or, as Geoffrey Moore once told me,,it's intellectual curiosity that's the trade that brands need,in the age of the blogosphere.,And I think this is beginning to happen in the entertainment business. 
 One of my heroes is songwriter, Ally Willis,,who just wrote "The Color Purple" and has been an R and --,rhythm and blues writer, and this is what she said,about where songwriting's going. 
 Ally Willis: Where millions of collaborators wanted the song,,because to look at them strictly as spam,is missing what this medium is about. 
 PH: So, to wrap up, I'd love to throw it back to Marshall McLuhan,,who, 40 years ago, was dealing with audiences,that were going through just as much change,,and I think that, today, traditional Hollywood and the writers,are framing this perhaps in the way that it was being framed before.,But I don't need to tell you this, let's throw it back to him. 
 (Video) Narrator: We are in the middle of a tremendous clash between the old and the new.,MM: The medium does things to people,and they are always completely unaware of this.,They don't really notice the new medium that is wrapping them up.,They think of the old medium,,because the old medium is always the content of the new medium,,as movies tend to be the content of TV,,and as books used to be the content,,novels used to be the content of movies.,And so every time a new medium arrives,,the old medium is the content, and it is highly observable,,highly noticeable, but the real, real roughing up and massaging,is done by the new medium, and it is ignored. 
 PH: I think it's a great time of enthrallment.,There's been more raw DNA of communications and media,thrown out there. Content is moving from shows to particles,that are batted back and forth, and part of social communications,,and I think this is going to be a time of great renaissance and opportunity.,And whereas television may have gotten beat up,,what's getting built is a really exciting new form of communication,,and we kind of have the merger of the two industries,and a new way of thinking to look at it. 
 Thanks very much.Some of you have heard the story before,,but, in fact, there's somebodynin the audience,who's never heard this storynin front of an audience before,,so I'm a little more nervousnthan I normally am telling this story.,I used to be a photographernfor many years.,In 1978, I was working for "TIME Magazine",and I was given a three-day assignmentnto photograph Amerasian children,,children who had been fatherednby American GIs all over Southeast Asia,,and then abandoned --n40,000 children all over Asia.,I had never heardnthe word Amerasian before.,I spent a few days photographingnchildren in different countries,,and like a lot of photographersnand a lot of journalists,,I always hoped thatnwhen my pictures are published,,they might actuallynhave an effect on a situation,,instead of just documenting it. 
 So, I was so disturbed by what I saw,and I was so unhappynwith the article that ran afterwards,,that I decidednI would take six months off.,I was 28 years old.,I decided I would findnsix children in different countries,,and actually go spendnsome time with the kids,,and try to tell their storyna little bit better,than I thought I had donenfor Time magazine.,In the course of doing the story,,I was looking for childrennwho hadn't been photographed before,,and the Pearl Buck Foundation told menthat they worked with a lot of Americans,who were donating moneynto help some of these kids.,And a man told me,,who ran the Pearl BucknFoundation in Korea,,that there was a young girl,nwho was 11 years old,,being raised by her grandmother.,And the grandmothernhad never let any Westerners see her.,Every time any Westernersncame to the village, she hid the girl.,Of course, I was immediately intrigued.,I saw photographs of hernand I thought I wanted to go.,And the guy just told me,,"This grandmother -- there's no waynshe's ever going to let you,meet this girl that's she's raising." 
 I took a translator with menand went to this village,,found the grandmother, sat down with her.,And to my astonishment, she agreednto let me photograph her granddaughter.,And I was paying for this myself,nso I asked the translator,if it would be OKnif I stayed for the week.,I had a sleeping bag.,The family had a small shednon the side of the house,,so I said, "Could I sleepnin my sleeping bag in the evenings?",And I just told the little girl,nwhose name was Eun-Sook Lee,,that if I ever did anythingnto embarrass her --,she didn't speak a word of English,nalthough she looked very American --,she could put up her hand and say, "Stop,"nand I would stop taking pictures.,Then my translator left.nI couldn't speak a word of Korean.,This is the first night I met Eun-Sook.,Her mother was still alive.,She was not raising her,nher grandmother was raising her.,And what struck me immediately,was how in loventhe two of these people were.,The grandmother was incredibly fond,ndeeply in love with this little girl.,They slept on the floor at night.,The way they heat their homes in Koreanis to put bricks under the floors,,so the heat radiatesnfrom underneath the floor.,Eun-Sook was 11 years old. 
 I had photographed,nas I said, a lot of these kids.,Eun-Sook was the fifth childnthat I found to photograph.,And almost universally,namongst all the kids,,they were really psychologically damaged,by having been made fun of,nridiculed, picked on and been rejected.,And Korea was probably the placenI found to be the worst for these kids.,And what struck me immediatelynin meeting Eun-Sook,was how confident she appeared to be,,how happy she seemed to benin her own skin.,And remember this picture,,because I'm going to show younanother picture later.,She looks much like her grandmother,nalthough she looks so Western. 
 I decided to follow her to school.,This is the first morningnI stayed with her.,This is on the way to school.,This is the morning assemblynoutside her school.,And I noticed thatnshe was clowning around.,When the teachers would ask questions,,she'd be the first personnto raise her hand.,Again, not at all shy or withdrawn,,or anything like the other childrennthat I'd photographed.,The first one to gonto the blackboard to answer questions.,Getting in trouble for whisperingninto her best friend's ears.,And one of the other thingsnI said to her through the translator --,again, this thing about saying stop --nwas to not pay attention to me.,So she really just completelynignored me most of the time.,I noticed that at recess,,she was the girl who pickednthe other girls to be on her team.,It was very obvious, from the beginning,nthat she was a leader.,This is on the way home.nAnd that's North Korea up along the hill.,This is up along the DMZ.,They would actuallyncover the windows every night,,so that light couldn't be seen,,because the South Korean governmentnhas said for years,that the North Koreansnmay invade at any time.,So the closer you were to North Korea,nthe more terrifying it was. 
 Very often at school,nI'd be taking pictures,,and she would whisperninto her girlfriends' ears,,and then look at me and say, "Stop.",And I would stand at attention,nand all the girls would crack up,,and it was sort of a little joke. 
 (Laughter) 
 The end of the week camenand my translator came back,,because I'd asked her to come back,,so I could formally thanknthe grandmother and Eun-Sook.,And in the course of the grandmotherntalking to the translator,,the grandmother started crying.,And I said to my translator,n"What's going on, why is she crying?",And she spoke tonthe grandmother for a moment,,and then she startedngetting tears in her eyes.,And I said, "What did I do?nWhy is everyone crying?",And the translator said,,"The grandmother saysnthat she thinks she's dying,,and she wants to know if you would takenEun-Sook to America with you.",And I said, "I'm 28 years oldnand I live in hotels,,and I'm not married.",I mean, I had fallen in lovenwith this girl,,but you know, emotionallynI was about 12 years old.,If you know of photographers,,the joke is it's the finest formnof delayed adolescence ever invented.,"Sorry, I have to gonon an assignment, I'll be back" --,and then you never come back. 
 So I asked the translatornwhy she thought she was dying.,Can I get her to a hospital?nCould I pay to get her a doctor?,And she refused any help at all.,So when I got outside,nI gave the translator some money and said,,"Go back and see if you can do something.",And I gave the grandmothernmy business card.,And I said, "If you're serious,nI will try to find a family for her.",And I immediately wrote a letternto my best friends in Atlanta, Georgia,,who had an 11-year-old son.,And my best friendnhad mistakenly one day said something,about wishing he had another child.,So my friends Gene and Gaylenhad not heard from me in about a year,,and suddenly I was calling,,saying "I'm in Koreanand I've met this extraordinary girl.",And I said, "The grandmothernthinks she's sick,,but I think maybe we would have tonbring the grandmother over also.",And I said, "I'll pay for the ... "nI mean, I had this whole sort of picture.,So anyway, I left.,And my friends actually saidnthey were very interested in adopting her.,And I said, "Look, I thinknI'll scare the grandmother to death,,if I tell her thatnyou're willing to adopt her.,I want to go back and talk to her."nBut I was off on assignment.,I figured I'd come backnin a couple of weeks,and talk to the grandmother. 
 And on Christmas Day, I was in Bangkoknwith a group of photographers,and got a telegram --nback in those days, you got telegrams --,from Time magazinensaying someone in Korea had died,and left their child in a will to me.,Did I know anything about this?,Because I hadn't told themnwhat I was doing,,because I was so upsetnwith the story they'd run.,So, I went back to Korea,nand I went back to Eun-Sook's village,,and she was gone.,And the house thatnI had spent time in was empty.,It was incredibly cold.,No one in the villagenwould tell me where Eun-Sook was,,because the grandmothernhad always hidden her from Westerners.,And they had no ideanabout this request that she'd made of me.,So I finally found Myung Sung,,her best friend that she used to play withnafter school every day.,And Myung Sung, under some pressurenfrom me and the translator,,gave us an addressnon the outside of Seoul.,And I went to that addressnand knocked on the door,,and a man answered the door.,It was not a very nice area of Seoul,nthere were mud streets outside of it.,And I knocked on the doornand Eun-Sook answered the door,,and her eyes were bloodshot,nand she seemed to be in shock.,She didn't recognize me --nthere was no recognition whatsoever.,And this man came to the doornand kind of barked something in Korean.,And I said to the translator,n"What did he say?",And she said, "He wantsnto know who you are.",And I said, "Tell himnthat I am a photographer.",I started explaining who I was,nand he interrupted.,And she said, "He says he knowsnwho you are, what do you want?",I said, "Well, tell him that I was askednby this little girl's grandmother,to find a family for her.",And he said, "I'm her uncle,nshe's fine, you can leave now." 
 So I was --,The door was being slammed in my face,,it's incredibly cold,nand I'm trying to think,,"What would the hero do in a movie,nif I was writing this as a movie script?",So I said, "It's really cold,nI've come a very long way,,do you mind if I come innfor a minute? I'm freezing.",So the guy reluctantly let us innand we sat down on the floor.,And as we started talking,nI saw him yell something,,and Eun-Sook camenand brought us some food.,And I had this whole mental picturenof -- sort of like Cinderella.,I sort of had this picturenof this incredibly wonderful,,bright, happy little child,,who now appeared to be very withdrawn,nbeing enslaved by this family.,And I was really appalled,nand I couldn't figure out what to do.,And the more I tried talking to him,nthe less friendly he was getting.,So finally I said "Look," --nthis is all through the translator,,because, you know,nI don't speak a word of Korean --,and I said, "Look, I'm really gladnthat Eun-Sook has a family to live with.,I was very worried about her.,I made a promise to her grandmother,nyour mother, that I would find a family,,and I'm so happy thatnyou're going to take care of her.,But I bought an airline ticketnand I'm stuck here for a week.,I'm staying in a hotel downtown.,Would you like to comenand have lunch tomorrow?,And you can practice your English.",Because he told me -- I was tryingnto ask him questions about himself. 
 And so I went to the hotel,nand I found two older Amerasians.,A girl whose mother had been a prostitute,,and she was a prostitute,,and a boy who'd been in and out of jail.,And I said to them,n"Look, there's a little girl,who has a tiny chancenof getting out of here,and going to America.,I don't know if it'snthe right decision or not,,but I would like younto come to lunch tomorrow,and tell the uncle what it's likento walk down the street,,what people say to you,nwhat you do for a living.,I want him to understandnwhat happens if she stays here.,And I could be wrong, I don't know,nbut I wish you would come tomorrow." 
 So, these two came to lunchnand we got thrown out of the restaurant.,They were yelling at him,nit got to be really ugly.,We went outside, and he was just furious.,And I knew I had totally blown this thing.,Here I was again,ntrying to figure out what to do.,And he started yelling at me,nand I said to the translator,,"Tell him to calm down,nwhat is he saying?",And she said, "He's saying, 'Who the hellnare you to walk into my house,,some rich Americannwith your cameras around your neck,,accusing me of enslaving my niece?,This is my niece, I love her,nshe's my sister's daughter.,Who the hell are younto accuse me of something like this?'",And I said, you know,n"Look, you're absolutely right.,I don't pretend to understandnwhat's going on here.,All I know is, I've beennphotographing a lot of these children.,I'm in love with your niece,,I think she's an incrediblynspecial child.",And I said, "Look, I will fly my friendsnover here from the United States,if you want to meet them,nto see if you approve of them.,I just think that --nwhat little I know about the situation,,she has very little chance herenof having the kind of life,that you probably would like her to have." 
 So, everyone told me afterwardsnthat inviting the prospective parents over,was, again, the stupidest thingnI could have possibly done,,because who's everngood enough for your relative?,But he invited me to come to a ceremonynthey were having that day,for her grandmother.,And they actually takenitems of clothing and photographs,,and they burn them as part of the ritual.,And you can see how different she looksnjust in three months.,This was now, I think, early February.,And the pictures beforenwere taken in September.,Well, there wasnan American Maryknoll priest,that I had met in the coursenof doing the story,,who had 75 children living in his house.,He had three women helping himntake care of these kids.,And so I suggested to the unclenthat we go down and meet Father Keane,to find out hownthe adoption process worked.,Because I wanted him to feel,like this was all being donenvery much above board. 
 So, this is on the wayndown to the orphanage.,This is Father Keane.nHe's just a wonderful guy.,He had kids fromnall over Korea living there,,and he would find families for these kids.,This is a social workerninterviewing Eun-Sook.,Now, I had always thought she wasncompletely untouched by all of this,,because the grandmother, to me,,appeared to be sort ofnthe village wise woman --,throughout the day, I noticed peoplenkept coming to visit her grandmother.,And I always had this mental picture,that even though they may have beennone of the poorer families in the village,,they were one of the most respected.,And I always felt that the grandmothernhad kind of demanded, and insisted,,that the villagers treat Eun-Sooknwith the same respect they treated her.,Eun-Sook stayed at Father Keane's,,and her uncle agreed to let her stay therenuntil the adoption went through.,He actually agreed to the adoption. 
 And I went off on assignmentnand came back a week later,,and Father Keane said,n"I've got to talk to you about Eun-Sook.",I said, "Oh God, now what?",And he takes me into this room,ncloses the door and says,,"I have 75 children here in the orphanage,nand it's total bedlam.",There's clothes, there's kids.,Three adults and 75 kids --nyou can imagine.,And he said, "The second daynshe was here she made up a list,of all of the namesnof the older kids and the younger kids.,And she assigned one of the older kidsnto each of the younger kids.,And then she set up a work detail listnof who cleaned the orphanage on what day.",And he said, "She's telling menthat I'm messy,and I have to clean up my room.",And he said, "I don't know who raised her,nbut she's running the orphanage,,and she's been here three days." 
 (Laughter) 
 This was movie day that she organizednwhere all the kids went to the movies.,A lot of the kids who had been adoptednwrote back to the other kids,,telling them what their lifenwas like with their new families.,So it was a really big dealnwhen the letters showed up.,This is a woman who isnnow working at the orphanage,,whose son had been adopted.,Gene and Gayle started studying Korean,the moment they had gottennmy first letter.,They really wanted to be ablento welcome Eun-Sook into their family.,And one of the things Father Keane told me,when I came backnfrom one of these trips --,Eun-Sook had chosen the name Natasha,,which I understood was from her watchingna "Rocky and Bullwinkle" cartoon,on the American Air Force station.,This may be onenof those myth-buster things,that we'll have tonclear up here, in a minute. 
 So, my friend Genenflew over with his son, Tim.,Gayle couldn't come.,And they spent a lot of timenhuddled over a dictionary.,And this was Gene showing the uncle,where Atlanta was on the map,nwhere he lived.,This is the unclensigning the adoption papers.,Now, we went out to dinnernthat night to celebrate.,The uncle went back to his family,and Natasha and Tim and Gene and Inwent out to dinner.,And Gene was showing Natashanhow to use a knife and fork,,and then Natashanwas returning the utensil lessons.,We went back to our hotel room,,and Gene was showing Natashanalso where Atlanta was.,This is the third night we were in Korea.,The first night we'd gotten a roomnfor the kids right next to us. 
 I'd been staying in this roomnfor about three months --,it was a little 15-story Korean hotel.,The second night,nwe didn't keep the kids' room,,because we slept on the floornwith all the kids at the orphanage.,And the third night, we came back --,we'd just gone out to dinner,nwhere you saw the pictures --,and we got to the front desk,nand the guy said,,"There's no other free roomsnon your floor tonight,,you can put the kidsnfive floors below you.",And Gene and Inlooked at each other and said,,"We don't want two 11-year-oldsnfive floors away.",So his son said, "I have a sleeping bag,nI'll sleep on the floor.",And I said, "I have one too."nSo Tim and I slept on the floor,,Natasha got one bed,nGene got the other -- kids pass out,,it's been very exciting for three days. 
 We're lying in bed, and Gene and Inare talking about how cool we are.,We said, "That was so great,nwe saved this little girl's life.",We were just like,nyou know, just full of ourselves.,And we fall asleep --,and I've been in this roomnfor a couple of months now.,And they always overheatnthe hotels in Korea terribly,,so during the daynI always left the window open.,And then about midnight,nthey turn the heat off in the hotel.,So at 1am, the whole room would benlike 20 below zero, and I'd get up.,I'd been doing thisnevery night I'd been there.,So, sure enough,nit's one o'clock, room's freezing,,I go to close the windownand I hear people shouting outside,,and I thought, "Oh, the barsnmust have just gotten out.",I don't speak Korean,nbut I'm hearing these voices,,and I'm not hearing anger,nI'm hearing terror.,So I open the window and I look out,,and there's flamesncoming up the side of our hotel,,and the hotel's on fire.,So I run over to Gene and I wake him up,,and I say, "Don't freak out,nI think the hotel's on fire.",And now there's smoke and flamesncoming by our windows --,we're on the 11th floor.,So the two of us were just like,n"Oh my God, oh my God." 
 So we're trying to get Natasha up,nand we can't talk to her.,You know what kids are likenwhen they've been asleep for like an hour,,it's like they took five Valiums --nthey're all over the place.,And we can't talk to her.,His son had the L.L.Bean bootlaces,nand we're trying to do up his laces.,So we try to get to the door,nwe run to the door, we open the door,,and it's like walkingninto a blast furnace.,There's people screaming,nthe sound of glass breaking, weird thumps.,And the whole room fillednwith smoke in about two seconds.,And Gene turns around and says,n"We're not going to make it.",And he closes the door, and the whole roomnis now filled with smoke.,We're all choking, and there's smoke,pouring through the vents,nunder the doors.,There's people screaming.,I just remember this unbelievable --njust utter chaos. 
 I remember sitting near the bed,nand I had two overwhelming feelings.,One was absolute terror.n"Oh, please God, I just want to wake up.,This has got to be a nightmare,nthis can't be happening.,Please, I just want to wake up.",And the other is unbelievable guilt.,Here I've been playing Godnwith my friends' lives,,my friends' son, with Natasha's life,,and this what you get when you trynplaying God, is you hurt people.,I remember just beingnso frightened and terrified.,And Gene, who's lying on the floor, says,,"We've got to soak towels."nI said, "What?","We've got to soak towels.nWe're going to die from the smoke.",So got towels and put themnover our faces and the kids' faces.,Then he said, "Do you have gaffer's tape?","What?" "Do you have gaffer's tape?",I said, "Somewhere in my Halliburton.",He says, "We've got to stop the smoke.nThat's all we can do.",I mean, Gene -- thank God for Gene.,So we put the room service menusnover the vents in the wall,,we put blankets at the bottom of the door,,we put the kids on the windowsillnto try to get some air.,And there was a new building, going up,,that was being builtnright across the street from our hotel.,And there, in the building,nwere photographers,,waiting for people to jump.,Eleven people ended up dying in the fire.,Five people jumped and died,nother people were killed by the smoke.,And there's this loud thumping on the doornafter about 45 minutes in all this,,and people were shouting in Korean.,And I remember --,Natasha didn't want us opening the door --,sorry, I was trying not to open the door,,because we'd spent so much timenbarricading the room.,I didn't know who it was,nI didn't know what they wanted,,and Natasha could tellnthey were firemen trying to get us out.,I remember a sort of a tussle at the door,ntrying to get the door open. 
 In any case, 12 hours later --nI mean, they put us in the lobby.,Gene ended up using his coat,nand his fist in the coat,,to break open a liquor cabinet.,People were lying on the floor.,It was one of justnthe most horrifying nights.,And then 12 hours later,nwe rented a car, as we had planned to,,and drove back to Natasha's village.,And we kept saying, "Do you realizenwe were dying in a hotel fire,,like eight hours ago?",It's so weird how life just goes on.,Natasha wanted to introduce her brothernand father to all the villagers,,and the day we showed up turned outnto be a 60-year-old man's birthday.,This guy's 60 years old.,So it turned into a dual celebration,,because Natasha wasnthe first person from this village,ever to go to the United States.,So, these are the greenhouse tents.,This is the eldersnteaching Gene their dances.,We drank a lot of rice wine.,We were both so drunk,nI couldn't believe it. 
 This is the last picturenbefore Gene and Tim headed back.,The adoption people told us,it was going to take a yearnfor the adoption to go through.,Like, what could you do for a year?,So I found out the name of every officialnon both the Korean and American side,,and I photographed them,,and told them how famous they werengoing to be when this book was done.,And four months later,nthe adoption papers came through.,This is saying goodbyento everybody at the orphanage.,This is Father Keane with Natashanat the bus stop.,Her great aunt at the airport.,I had a wonderful deal with Cathay Pacificnairlines for many years,,where they gave me free passesnon all their airlines,in return for photography.,It was like the ultimate perk.,And the pilot, I actually knew --,because they used to let me sitnin the jump seat,,to tell you how long ago this was.,This is a TriStar, and so they let Natashanactually sit in the jump seat.,And the pilot, Jeff Cowley,nactually went back,and adopted one of the other kidsnat the orphanage after meeting Natasha. 
 This is 28 hours later in Atlanta.,It's a very long flight.,Just to make things even crazier,nGayle, Natasha's new mom,,was three days awaynfrom giving birth to her own daughter.,You know, if you werenwriting this, you'd say,,"No, we've got to writenthe script differently.",This is the first night showing Natashanher new cousins and uncles and aunts.,Gene and Gayle know everyone in Atlanta --nthey're the most social couple imaginable.,So, at this point, Natashandoesn't speak a word of English,,other than what littlenFather Keane taught her.,This is Kylie, her sister,nwho's now a doctor, on the right.,This is a deal I had with Natasha,nwhich is that when we got to Atlanta,she could cut off my beard.,She never liked it very much. 
 She learned English in three months.,She entered seventh gradenat her own age level.,Pledge of Allegiance for the first time.,This is her cooking teacher.,Natasha told me a lot of the kidsnthought she was stuck up,,because they would talk to hernand she wouldn't answer,,and they didn't realizenshe didn't speak English very well.,But what I noticed, again as an observer,,was she was choosingnwho was going to be on her team,,and seemed to be very popularnvery, very quickly.,Now, remember the picture,,how much she looked likenher grandmother, at the beginning?,People were always telling Natashanhow much she looks like her mother, Gayle. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is a tense momentnin the first football game, I think.,And Kylie -- I mean, it wasnalmost like Kylie was her own child.,She's being baptized.,Now, a lot of parents, when they adopt,,actually want to erasentheir children's history.,And Gayle and Genendid the complete opposite.,They were studying Korean;nthey bought Korean clothes.,Gene even did a littlentile work in the kitchen,,which was that, "Once upon a time,nthere was a beautiful girl,that came from the hills of Koreanto live happily ever after in Atlanta." 
 She hates this picture --nit was her first job.,She bought a bright red Karmann Ghia,with the money she madenworking at Burger King.,The captain of the cheerleaders.,Beauty pageant.,Used to do theirnChristmas card every year.,Gene's been restoring this carnfor a million years. 
 Kodak hired Natasha to be a translatornfor them at the Olympics in Korea.,Her future husband, Jeff,nwas working for Canon cameras,,and met Natasha at the Olympic Village.,This is her first trip back to Korea.nSo there's her uncle.,This is her half sister.,She went back to the village.,That's her best friend's mother.,And I always thought that wasna very Annie Hall kind of outfit. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's just, you know, it wasnjust so interesting, just to watch --,this is her mothernin the background there.,This is Natasha's wedding day.,Gene is looking a little older.,This is Sydney, who's going to benthree years old in a couple of days.,And there's Evan. 
 And Natasha, would younjust come up, for a second,,just maybe to say hello to everybody? 
 (Applause) 
 Natasha's actuallynnever heard me tell the story.,You know, we've lookednat the pictures together. 
 Natasha: I've seen picturesnmillions of times,,but today was the first time I'm actuallynseeing him give the whole presentation.,I started crying. 
 Rick Smolan: There's about 40 thingsnshe's going to tell me,,"That wasn't what happened."nNatasha: I'll tell you that later. 
 RS: Anyway, thank you, Mike and Richard,nso much for letting us tell the story. 
 Thank you, all of you. 
 (Applause)
