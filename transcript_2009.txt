I wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation,,sharing some of the problems.,And Warren Buffet had recommended I do that --,being honest about what was going well, what wasn't,,and making it kind of an annual thing.,A goal I had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems,,because I think there are some very important problems,that don't get worked on naturally.,That is, the market does not drive the scientists,,the communicators, the thinkers, the governments,to do the right things.,And only by paying attention to these things,and having brilliant people who care and draw other people in,can we make as much progress as we need to. 
 So this morning I'm going to share two of these problems,and talk about where they stand.,But before I dive into those I want to admit that I am an optimist.,Any tough problem, I think it can be solved.,And part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past.,Over the past century, average lifespan has more than doubled.,Another statistic, perhaps my favorite,,is to look at childhood deaths.,As recently as 1960, 110 million children were born,,and 20 million of those died before the age of five.,Five years ago, 135 million children were born -- so, more --,and less than 10 million of them died before the age of five.,So that's a factor of two reduction of the childhood death rate.,It's a phenomenal thing.,Each one of those lives matters a lot. 
 And the key reason we were able to it was not only rising incomes,but also a few key breakthroughs:,vaccines that were used more widely.,For example, measles was four million of the deaths,back as recently as 1990,and now is under 400,000.,So we really can make changes.,The next breakthrough is to cut that 10 million in half again.,And I think that's doable in well under 20 years.,Why? Well there's only a few diseases,that account for the vast majority of those deaths:,diarrhea, pneumonia and malaria. 
 So that brings us to the first problem that I'll raise this morning,,which is how do we stop a deadly disease that's spread by mosquitos? 
 Well, what's the history of this disease?,It's been a severe disease for thousands of years.,In fact, if we look at the genetic code,,it's the only disease we can see,that people who lived in Africa,actually evolved several things to avoid malarial deaths.,Deaths actually peaked at a bit over five million in the 1930s.,So it was absolutely gigantic.,And the disease was all over the world.,A terrible disease. It was in the United States. It was in Europe.,People didn't know what caused it until the early 1900s,,when a British military man figured out that it was mosquitos.,So it was everywhere.,And two tools helped bring the death rate down.,One was killing the mosquitos with DDT.,The other was treating the patients with quinine, or quinine derivatives.,And so that's why the death rate did come down. 
 Now, ironically, what happened was,it was eliminated from all the temperate zones,,which is where the rich countries are.,So we can see: 1900, it's everywhere.,1945, it's still most places.,1970, the U.S. and most of Europe have gotten rid of it.,1990, you've gotten most of the northern areas.,And more recently you can see it's just around the equator. 
 And so this leads to the paradox that,because the disease is only in the poorer countries,,it doesn't get much investment.,For example, there's more money put into baldness drugs,than are put into malaria.,Now, baldness, it's a terrible thing.,(Laughter),And rich men are afflicted.,And so that's why that priority has been set. 
 But, malaria --,even the million deaths a year caused by malaria,greatly understate its impact.,Over 200 million people at any one time are suffering from it.,It means that you can't get the economies in these areas going,because it just holds things back so much.,Now, malaria is of course transmitted by mosquitos.,I brought some here, just so you could experience this.,We'll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit.,(Laughter),There's no reason only poor people should have the experience.,(Laughter) (Applause),Those mosquitos are not infected. 
 So we've come up with a few new things. We've got bed nets.,And bed nets are a great tool.,What it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night,,so the mosquitos that bite late at night can't get at them.,And when you use indoor spraying with DDT,and those nets,you can cut deaths by over 50 percent.,And that's happened now in a number of countries.,It's great to see. 
 But we have to be careful because malaria --,the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves.,So every tool that we've ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective.,And so you end up with two choices.,If you go into a country with the right tools and the right way,,you do it vigorously,,you can actually get a local eradication.,And that's where we saw the malaria map shrinking.,Or, if you go in kind of half-heartedly,,for a period of time you'll reduce the disease burden,,but eventually those tools will become ineffective,,and the death rate will soar back up again.,And the world has gone through this where it paid attention and then didn't pay attention. 
 Now we're on the upswing.,Bed net funding is up.,There's new drug discovery going on.,Our foundation has backed a vaccine that's going into phase three trial,that starts in a couple months.,And that should save over two thirds of the lives if it's effective.,So we're going to have these new tools. 
 But that alone doesn't give us the road map.,Because the road map to get rid of this disease,involves many things.,It involves communicators to keep the funding high,,to keep the visibility high,,to tell the success stories.,It involves social scientists,,so we know how to get not just 70 percent of the people to use the bed nets,,but 90 percent.,We need mathematicians to come in and simulate this,,to do Monte Carlo things to understand how these tools combine and work together.,Of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise.,We need rich-world governments to be very generous in providing aid for these things.,And so as these elements come together,,I'm quite optimistic,that we will be able to eradicate malaria. 
 Now let me turn to a second question,,a fairly different question, but I'd say equally important.,And this is: How do you make a teacher great?,It seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on,,and we'd understand very well.,And the answer is, really, that we don't.,Let's start with why this is important.,Well, all of us here, I'll bet, had some great teachers.,We all had a wonderful education.,That's part of the reason we're here today,,part of the reason we're successful.,I can say that, even though I'm a college drop-out.,I had great teachers. 
 In fact, in the United States, the teaching system has worked fairly well.,There are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places.,So the top 20 percent of students have gotten a good education.,And those top 20 percent have been the best in the world,,if you measure them against the other top 20 percent.,And they've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology,and keep the U.S. at the forefront. 
 Now, the strength for those top 20 percent,is starting to fade on a relative basis,,but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting.,Not only has that been weak. it's getting weaker.,And if you look at the economy, it really is only providing opportunities now,to people with a better education.,And we have to change this.,We have to change it so that people have equal opportunity.,We have to change it so that the country is strong,and stays at the forefront,of things that are driven by advanced education,,like science and mathematics. 
 When I first learned the statistics,,I was pretty stunned at how bad things are.,Over 30 percent of kids never finish high school.,And that had been covered up for a long time,because they always took the dropout rate as the number,who started in senior year and compared it to the number who finished senior year.,Because they weren't tracking where the kids were before that.,But most of the dropouts had taken place before that.,They had to raise the stated dropout rate,as soon as that tracking was done,to over 30 percent.,For minority kids, it's over 50 percent.,And even if you graduate from high school,,if you're low-income,,you have less than a 25 percent chance of ever completing a college degree.,If you're low-income in the United States,,you have a higher chance of going to jail,than you do of getting a four-year degree.,And that doesn't seem entirely fair. 
 So, how do you make education better? 
 Now, our foundation, for the last nine years, has invested in this.,There's many people working on it.,We've worked on small schools,,we've funded scholarships,,we've done things in libraries.,A lot of these things had a good effect.,But the more we looked at it, the more we realized that having great teachers,was the very key thing.,And we hooked up with some people studying,how much variation is there between teachers,,between, say, the top quartile -- the very best --,and the bottom quartile.,How much variation is there within a school or between schools?,And the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable.,A top quartile teacher will increase the performance of their class --,based on test scores --,by over 10 percent in a single year.,What does that mean?,That means that if the entire U.S., for two years,,had top quartile teachers,,the entire difference between us and Asia would go away.,Within four years we would be blowing everyone in the world away. 
 So, it's simple. All you need are those top quartile teachers.,And so you'd say, "Wow, we should reward those people.,We should retain those people.,We should find out what they're doing and transfer that skill to other people.",But I can tell you that absolutely is not happening today. 
 What are the characteristics of this top quartile?,What do they look like?,You might think these must be very senior teachers.,And the answer is no.,Once somebody has taught for three years,their teaching quality does not change thereafter.,The variation is very, very small.,You might think these are people with master's degrees.,They've gone back and they've gotten their Master's of Education.,This chart takes four different factors,and says how much do they explain teaching quality.,That bottom thing, which says there's no effect at all,,is a master's degree. 
 Now, the way the pay system works is there's two things that are rewarded.,One is seniority.,Because your pay goes up and you vest into your pension.,The second is giving extra money to people who get their master's degree.,But it in no way is associated with being a better teacher.,Teach for America: slight effect.,For math teachers majoring in math there's a measurable effect.,But, overwhelmingly, it's your past performance.,There are some people who are very good at this.,And we've done almost nothing,to study what that is,and to draw it in and to replicate it,,to raise the average capability --,or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system. 
 You might say, "Do the good teachers stay and the bad teacher's leave?",The answer is, on average, the slightly better teachers leave the system.,And it's a system with very high turnover. 
 Now, there are a few places -- very few -- where great teachers are being made.,A good example of one is a set of charter schools called KIPP.,KIPP means Knowledge Is Power.,It's an unbelievable thing.,They have 66 schools -- mostly middle schools, some high schools --,and what goes on is great teaching.,They take the poorest kids,,and over 96 percent of their high school graduates go to four-year colleges.,And the whole spirit and attitude in those schools,is very different than in the normal public schools.,They're team teaching. They're constantly improving their teachers.,They're taking data, the test scores,,and saying to a teacher, "Hey, you caused this amount of increase.",They're deeply engaged in making teaching better. 
 When you actually go and sit in one of these classrooms,,at first it's very bizarre.,I sat down and I thought, "What is going on?",The teacher was running around, and the energy level was high.,I thought, "I'm in the sports rally or something.,What's going on?",And the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren't paying attention,,which kids were bored,,and calling kids rapidly, putting things up on the board.,It was a very dynamic environment,,because particularly in those middle school years -- fifth through eighth grade --,keeping people engaged and setting the tone,that everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention,,nobody gets to make fun of it or have the position of the kid who doesn't want to be there.,Everybody needs to be involved.,And so KIPP is doing it. 
 How does that compare to a normal school?,Well, in a normal school, teachers aren't told how good they are.,The data isn't gathered.,In the teacher's contract,,it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom --,sometimes to once per year.,And they need advanced notice to do that.,So imagine running a factory where you've got these workers,,some of them just making crap,and the management is told, "Hey, you can only come down here once a year,,but you need to let us know, because we might actually fool you,,and try and do a good job in that one brief moment." 
 Even a teacher who wants to improve doesn't have the tools to do it.,They don't have the test scores,,and there's a whole thing of trying to block the data.,For example, New York passed a law,that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used,in the tenure decision for the teachers.,And so that's sort of working in the opposite direction.,But I'm optimistic about this,,I think there are some clear things we can do. 
 First of all, there's a lot more testing going on,,and that's given us the picture of where we are.,And that allows us to understand who's doing it well,,and call them out, and find out what those techniques are.,Of course, digital video is cheap now.,Putting a few cameras in the classroom,and saying that things are being recorded on an ongoing basis,is very practical in all public schools.,And so every few weeks teachers could sit down,and say, "OK, here's a little clip of something I thought I did well.,Here's a little clip of something I think I did poorly.,Advise me -- when this kid acted up, how should I have dealt with that?",And they could all sit and work together on those problems.,You can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it,,have it so everyone sees who is the very best at teaching this stuff. 
 You can take those great courses and make them available,so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course, learn from that.,If you have a kid who's behind,,you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept.,And in fact, these free courses could not only be available just on the Internet,,but you could make it so that DVDs were always available,,and so anybody who has access to a DVD player can have the very best teachers.,And so by thinking of this as a personnel system,,we can do it much better. 
 Now there's a book actually, about KIPP --,the place that this is going on --,that Jay Matthews, a news reporter, wrote -- called, "Work Hard, Be Nice.",And I thought it was so fantastic.,It gave you a sense of what a good teacher does.,I'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book.,(Applause) 
 Now, we put a lot of money into education,,and I really think that education is the most important thing to get right,for the country to have as strong a future as it should have.,In fact we have in the stimulus bill -- it's interesting --,the House version actually had money in it for these data systems,,and it was taken out in the Senate,because there are people who are threatened by these things. 
 But I -- I'm optimistic.,I think people are beginning to recognize how important this is,,and it really can make a difference for millions of lives, if we get it right.,I only had time to frame those two problems.,There's a lot more problems like that --,AIDS, pneumonia -- I can just see you're getting excited,,just at the very name of these things.,And the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad.,You know, the system doesn't naturally make it happen.,Governments don't naturally pick these things in the right way.,The private sector doesn't naturally put its resources into these things. 
 So it's going to take brilliant people like you,to study these things, get other people involved --,and you're helping to come up with solutions.,And with that, I think there's some great things that will come out of it. 
 Thank you.,(Applause)I've been working on issues of poverty for more than 20 years,,and so it's ironic that the problem that and question that I most grapple with,is how you actually define poverty. What does it mean?,So often, we look at dollar terms --,people making less than a dollar or two or three a day.,And yet the complexity of poverty really has to look at,income as only one variable.,Because really, it's a condition about choice,,and the lack of freedom. 
 And I had an experience that really deepened and elucidated for me,the understanding that I have.,It was in Kenya, and I want to share it with you.,I was with my friend Susan Meiselas, the photographer,,in the Mathare Valley slums.,Now, Mathare Valley is one of the oldest slums in Africa.,It's about three miles out of Nairobi,,and it's a mile long and about two-tenths of a mile wide,,where over half a million people,live crammed in these little tin shacks,,generation after generation, renting them,,often eight or 10 people to a room.,And it's known for prostitution, violence, drugs:,a hard place to grow up.,And when we were walking through the narrow alleys,,it was literally impossible not to step in the,raw sewage and the garbage alongside the little homes.,But at the same time it was also,impossible not to see the human vitality,,the aspiration and the ambition of the people who live there:,women washing their babies, washing their clothes, hanging them out to dry.,I met this woman, Mama Rose,,who has rented that little tin shack for 32 years,,where she lives with her seven children.,Four sleep in one twin bed,,and three sleep on the mud and linoleum floor.,And she keeps them all in school by selling water from that kiosk,,and from selling soap and bread from the little store inside. 
 It was also the day after the inauguration,,and I was reminded how Mathare is still connected to the globe.,And I would see kids on the street corners,,and they'd say "Obama, he's our brother!",And I'd say "Well, Obama's my brother, so that makes you my brother too.",And they would look quizzically, and then be like, "High five!" 
 And it was here that I met Jane.,I was struck immediately by the kindness and the gentleness in her face,,and I asked her to tell me her story.,She started off by telling me her dream. She said, "I had two.,My first dream was to be a doctor,,and the second was to marry a good man,who would stay with me and my family,,because my mother was a single mom,,and couldn't afford to pay for school fees.,So I had to give up the first dream, and I focused on the second.",She got married when she was 18, had a baby right away.,And when she turned 20, found herself pregnant with a second child,,her mom died and her husband left her -- married another woman.,So she was again in Mathare, with no income, no skill set, no money.,And so she ultimately turned to prostitution.,It wasn't organized in the way we often think of it.,She would go into the city at night with about 20 girls,,look for work, and sometimes come back with a few shillings,,or sometimes with nothing.,And she said, "You know, the poverty wasn't so bad. It was the humiliation,and the embarrassment of it all." 
 In 2001, her life changed.,She had a girlfriend who had heard about this organization, Jamii Bora,,that would lend money to people no matter how poor you were,,as long as you provided a commensurate amount in savings.,And so she spent a year to save 50 dollars,,and started borrowing, and over time she was able to buy a sewing machine.,She started tailoring.,And that turned into what she does now,,which is to go into the secondhand clothing markets,,and for about three dollars and 25 cents she buys an old ball gown.,Some of them might be ones you gave.,And she repurposes them with frills and ribbons,,and makes these frothy confections that she sells to women,for their daughter's Sweet 16 or first Holy Communion --,those milestones in a life that people want to celebrate,all along the economic spectrum.,And she does really good business. In fact, I watched her,walk through the streets hawking. And before you knew it,,there was a crowd of women around her, buying these dresses. 
 And I reflected, as I was watching her sell the dresses,,and also the jewelry that she makes,,that now Jane makes more than four dollars a day.,And by many definitions she is no longer poor.,But she still lives in Mathare Valley.,And so she can't move out.,She lives with all of that insecurity,,and in fact, in January, during the ethnic riots,,she was chased from her home and had to find a new shack,in which she would live. 
 Jamii Bora understands that and understands,that when we're talking about poverty,,we've got to look at people all along the economic spectrum.,And so with patient capital from Acumen and other organizations,,loans and investments that will go the long term with them,,they built a low-cost housing development,,about an hour outside Nairobi central.,And they designed it from the perspective of,customers like Jane herself,,insisting on responsibility and accountability.,So she has to give 10 percent of the mortgage --,of the total value, or about 400 dollars in savings.,And then they match her mortgage to what she paid in rent for her little shanty.,And in the next couple of weeks, she's going to be,among the first 200 families to move into this development. 
 When I asked her if she feared anything,,or whether she would miss anything from Mathare,,she said, "What would I fear,that I haven't confronted already?,I'm HIV positive. I've dealt with it all.",And she said, "What would I miss?,You think I will miss the violence or the drugs? The lack of privacy?,Do you think I'll miss not knowing if my children are going to come home,at the end of the day?" She said "If you gave me 10 minutes,my bags would be packed.",I said, "Well what about your dreams?",And she said, "Well, you know,,my dreams don't look exactly like I thought they would when I was a little girl.,But if I think about it, I thought I wanted a husband,,but what I really wanted was a family,that was loving. And I fiercely love my children, and they love me back.",She said, "I thought that I wanted to be a doctor,,but what I really wanted to be was somebody,who served and healed and cured.,And so I feel so blessed with everything that I have,,that two days a week I go and I counsel HIV patients.,And I say, 'Look at me. You are not dead.,You are still alive. And if you are still alive you have to serve.'",And she said, "I'm not a doctor who gives out pills.,But maybe me, I give out something better,because I give them hope." 
 And in the middle of this economic crisis,,where so many of us are inclined to pull in,with fear, I think we're well suited to,take a cue from Jane and reach out,,recognizing that being poor doesn't mean being ordinary.,Because when systems are broken,,like the ones that we're seeing around the world,,it's an opportunity for invention and for innovation.,It's an opportunity to truly build a world,where we can extend services and products,to all human beings, so that they can,make decisions and choices for themselves.,I truly believe it's where dignity starts.,We owe it to the Janes of the world.,And just as important, we owe it to ourselves. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Believe me or not, I come offering a solution,to a very important part of this larger problem,,with the requisite focus on climate.,And the solution I offer,is to the biggest culprit,in this massive mistreatment of the earth,by humankind,,and the resulting decline of the biosphere.,That culprit is business and industry,,which happens to be where I have spent the last 52 years,since my graduation from Georgia Tech in 1956.,As an industrial engineer,,cum aspiring and then successful entrepreneur.,After founding my company, Interface, from scratch,in 1973, 36 years ago,,to produce carpet tiles in America,for the business and institution markets,,and shepherding it through start-up and survival,to prosperity and global dominance in its field,,I read Paul Hawken's book,,"The Ecology of Commerce,",the summer of 1994.,In his book, Paul charges business and industry,as, one, the major culprit,in causing the decline of the biosphere,,and, two, the only institution that is large enough,,and pervasive enough, and powerful enough,,to really lead humankind out of this mess.,And by the way he convicted me,as a plunderer of the earth. 
 And I then challenged the people of Interface, my company,,to lead our company and the entire industrial world to sustainability,,which we defined as eventually operating,our petroleum-intensive company in such a way,as to take from the earth,only what can be renewed by the earth, naturally and rapidly --,not another fresh drop of oil --,and to do no harm to the biosphere.,Take nothing: do no harm.,I simply said, "If Hawken is right,and business and industry must lead,,who will lead business and industry?,Unless somebody leads, nobody will.",It's axiomatic. Why not us?,And thanks to the people of Interface,,I have become a recovering plunderer. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 I once told a Fortune Magazine writer,that someday people like me would go to jail.,And that became the headline of a Fortune article.,They went on to describe me as America's greenest CEO.,From plunderer to recovering plunderer,,to America's greenest CEO in five years --,that, frankly, was a pretty sad commentary,on American CEOs in 1999.,Asked later in the Canadian documentary, "The Corporation,",what I meant by the "go to jail" remark,,I offered that theft is a crime.,And theft of our children's future would someday be a crime.,But I realized, for that to be true --,for theft of our children's future to be a crime --,there must be a clear, demonstrable alternative,to the take-make-waste industrial system,that so dominates our civilization,,and is the major culprit, stealing our children's future,,by digging up the earth,and converting it to products that quickly become waste,in a landfill or an incinerator --,in short, digging up the earth and converting it to pollution. 
 According to Paul and Anne Ehrlich,and a well-known environmental impact equation,,impact -- a bad thing --,is the product of population, affluence and technology.,That is, impact is generated by people,,what they consume in their affluence,,and how it is produced.,And though the equation is largely subjective,,you can perhaps quantify people, and perhaps quantify affluence,,but technology is abusive in too many ways to quantify.,So the equation is conceptual.,Still it works to help us understand the problem. 
 So we set out at Interface, in 1994,,to create an example:,to transform the way we made carpet,,a petroleum-intensive product for materials as well as energy,,and to transform our technologies,so they diminished environmental impact,,rather than multiplied it.,Paul and Anne Ehrlich's environmental impact equation:,I is equal to P times A times T:,population, affluence and technology.,I wanted Interface to rewrite that equation so that it read,I equals P times A divided by T.,Now, the mathematically-minded will see immediately,that T in the numerator increases impact -- a bad thing --,but T in the denominator decreases impact.,So I ask, "What would move T, technology,,from the numerator -- call it T1 --,where it increases impact,,to the denominator -- call it T2 --,where it reduces impact? 
 I thought about the characteristics,of first industrial revolution,,T1, as we practiced it at Interface,,and it had the following characteristics.,Extractive: taking raw materials from the earth.,Linear: take, make, waste.,Powered by fossil fuel-derived energy.,Wasteful: abusive and focused on labor productivity.,More carpet per man-hour.,Thinking it through, I realized that all those attributes,must be changed to move T to the denominator.,In the new industrial revolution extractive must be replaced by renewable;,linear by cyclical;,fossil fuel energy by renewable energy, sunlight;,wasteful by waste-free;,and abusive by benign;,and labor productivity by resource productivity.,And I reasoned that if we could make those transformative changes,,and get rid of T1 altogether,,we could reduce our impact to zero,,including our impact on the climate.,And that became the Interface plan in 1995,,and has been the plan ever since. 
 We have measured our progress very rigorously.,So I can tell you how far we have come in the ensuing 12 years.,Net greenhouse gas emissions,down 82 percent in absolute tonnage.,(Applause),Over the same span of time,sales have increased by two-thirds and profits have doubled.,So an 82 percent absolute reduction,translates into a 90 percent reduction,in greenhouse gas intensity relative to sales.,This is the magnitude,of the reduction the entire global technosphere,must realize by 2050,to avoid catastrophic climate disruption --,so the scientists are telling us.,Fossil fuel usage is down 60 percent per unit of production,,due to efficiencies in renewables.,The cheapest, most secure barrel of oil there is,is the one not used through efficiencies.,Water usage is down 75 percent,in our worldwide carpet tile business.,Down 40 percent in our broadloom carpet business,,which we acquired in 1993,right here in California, City of Industry,,where water is so precious.,Renewable or recyclable materials are 25 percent of the total, and growing rapidly.,Renewable energy is 27 percent of our total,,going for 100 percent.,We have diverted 148 million pounds --,that's 74,000 tons --,of used carpet from landfills,,closing the loop on material flows,through reverse logistics,and post-consumer recycling technologies,that did not exist when we started 14 years ago. 
 Those new cyclical technologies,have contributed mightily to the fact that we have produced and sold,85 million square yards of climate-neutral carpet,since 2004,,meaning no net contribution to global climate disruption,in producing the carpet throughout the supply chain,,from mine and well head clear to end-of-life reclamation --,independent third-party certified.,We call it Cool Carpet.,And it has been a powerful marketplace differentiator,,increasing sales and profits.,Three years ago we launched carpet tile for the home,,under the brand Flor,,misspelled F-L-O-R.,You can point and click today at Flor.com,and have Cool Carpet delivered to your front door in five days.,It is practical, and pretty too. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 We reckon that we are a bit over halfway,to our goal: zero impact, zero footprint.,We've set 2020 as our target year for zero,,for reaching the top, the summit of Mount Sustainability.,We call this Mission Zero.,And this is perhaps the most important facet:,we have found Mission Zero to be incredibly good for business.,A better business model,,a better way to bigger profits.,Here is the business case for sustainability.,From real life experience, costs are down, not up,,reflecting some 400 million dollars,of avoided costs in pursuit of zero waste --,the first face of Mount Sustainability.,This has paid all the costs for the transformation of Interface. 
 And this dispels a myth too,,this false choice between the environment and the economy.,Our products are the best they've ever been,,inspired by design for sustainability,,an unexpected wellspring of innovation.,Our people are galvanized around this shared higher purpose.,You cannot beat it for attracting the best people,and bringing them together.,And the goodwill of the marketplace is astonishing.,No amount of advertising, no clever marketing campaign,,at any price, could have produced or created,this much goodwill.,Costs, products, people, marketplaces --,what else is there?,It is a better business model. 
 And here is our 14-year record of sales and profits.,There is a dip there, from 2001 to 2003:,a dip when our sales, over a three-year period,,were down 17 percent.,But the marketplace was down 36 percent.,We literally gained market share.,We might not have survived that recession,but for the advantages of sustainability.,If every business were pursuing Interface plans,,would that solve all our problems?,I don't think so.,I remain troubled by the revised Ehrlich equation,,I equals P times A divided by T2.,That A is a capital A,,suggesting that affluence is an end in itself.,But what if we reframed Ehrlich further?,And what if we made A a lowercase 'a,',suggesting that it is a means to an end,,and that end is happiness --,more happiness with less stuff. 
 You know that would reframe civilization itself --,(Applause) --,and our whole system of economics,,if not for our species, then perhaps for the one that succeeds us:,the sustainable species, living on a finite earth,,ethically, happily and ecologically,in balance with nature,and all her natural systems for a thousand generations,,or 10,000 generations --,that is to say, into the indefinite future.,But does the earth have to wait for our extinction as a species?,Well maybe so. But I don't think so. 
 At Interface we really intend to bring this prototypical,sustainable, zero-footprint industrial company,fully into existence by 2020.,We can see our way now,,clear to the top of that mountain.,And now the challenge is in execution.,And as my good friend and adviser Amory Lovins says,,"If something exists, it must be possible.",(Laughter),If we can actually do it, it must be possible.,If we, a petro-intensive company can do it, anybody can.,And if anybody can, it follows that everybody can. 
 Hawken fulfilled business and industry,,leading humankind away from the abyss,because, with continued unchecked decline of the biosphere,,a very dear person is at risk here --,frankly, an unacceptable risk.,Who is that person?,Not you. Not I.,But let me introduce you to the one who is most at risk here.,And I myself met this person in the early days of this mountain climb.,On a Tuesday morning in March of 1996,,I was talking to people, as I did at every opportunity back then,,bringing them along and often not knowing whether I was connecting.,But about five days later back in Atlanta,,I received an email from Glenn Thomas,,one of my people in the California meeting.,He was sending me an original poem,that he had composed after our Tuesday morning together.,And when I read it it was one of the most uplifting moments of my life.,Because it told me, by God, one person got it.,Here is what Glenn wrote. And here is that person, most at risk.,Please meet "Tomorrow's Child." 
 "Without a name, an unseen face, and knowing not your time or place, 
 Tomorrow's child, though yet unborn,,I met you first last Tuesday morn. 
 A wise friend introduced us two.,And through his sobering point of view 
 I saw a day that you would see, a day for you but not for me. 
 Knowing you has changed my thinking.,For I never had an inkling 
 that perhaps the things I do might someday,,somehow threaten you. 
 Tomorrow's child, my daughter, son, 
 I'm afraid I've just begun to think of you and of your good, 
 though always having known I should. 
 Begin, I will. 
 The way the cost of what I squander, what is lost, 
 if ever I forget that you,will someday come and live here too." 
 Well, every day of my life since,,"Tomorrow's Child" has spoken to me,with one simple but profound message,,which I presume to share with you.,We are, each and every one,,a part of the web of life.,The continuum of humanity, sure, but in a larger sense, the web of life itself.,And we have a choice to make,during our brief, brief visit,to this beautiful blue and green living planet:,to hurt it or to help it.,For you, it's your call. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm Dr. David Hanson, and I build robots with character.,And by that, I mean,that I develop robots that are characters,,but also robots that will eventually,come to empathize with you.,So we're starting with a variety of technologies,that have converged into these conversational character robots,that can see faces, make eye contact with you,,make a full range of facial expressions, understand speech,and begin to model how you're feeling,and who you are, and build a relationship with you. 
 I developed a series of technologies,that allowed the robots to make more realistic facial expressions,than previously achieved, on lower power,,which enabled the walking biped robots, the first androids.,So, it's a full range of facial expressions,simulating all the major muscles in the human face,,running on very small batteries,,extremely lightweight. 
 The materials that allowed the battery-operated facial expressions,is a material that we call Frubber,,and it actually has three major innovations,in the material that allow this to happen.,One is hierarchical pores,,and the other is a macro-molecular nanoscale porosity in the material. 
 There he's starting to walk.,This is at the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology.,I built the head. They built the body.,So the goal here is to achieve sentience in machines,,and not just sentience, but empathy. 
 We're working with the Machine Perception Laboratory,at the U.C. San Diego.,They have this really remarkable facial expression technology,that recognizes facial expressions,,what facial expressions you're making.,It also recognizes where you're looking, your head orientation.,We're emulating all the major facial expressions,,and then controlling it with the software,that we call the Character Engine.,And here is a little bit of the technology that's involved in that. 
 In fact, right now -- plug it from here, and then plug it in here,,and now let's see if it gets my facial expressions.,Okay. So I'm smiling.,(Laughter),Now I'm frowning.,And this is really heavily backlit.,Okay, here we go.,Oh, it's so sad.,Okay, so you smile, frowning.,So his perception of your emotional states,is very important for machines to effectively become empathetic. 
 Machines are becoming devastatingly capable,of things like killing. Right?,Those machines have no place for empathy.,And there is billions of dollars being spent on that.,Character robotics could plant the seed,for robots that actually have empathy.,So, if they achieve human level intelligence,or, quite possibly, greater than human levels of intelligence,,this could be the seeds of hope for our future. 
 So, we've made 20 robots in the last eight years, during the course of getting my Ph.D.,And then I started Hanson Robotics,,which has been developing these things for mass manufacturing.,This is one of our robots,that we showed at Wired NextFest a couple of years ago.,And it sees multiple people in a scene,,remembers where individual people are,,and looks from person to person, remembering people. 
 So, we're involving two things.,One, the perception of people,,and two, the natural interface,,the natural form of the interface,,so that it's more intuitive for you to interact with the robot.,You start to believe that it's alive and aware. 
 So one of my favorite projects was bringing all this stuff together,in an artistic display of an android portrait,of science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick,,who wrote great works like, "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?",which was the basis of the movie "Bladerunner.",In these stories, robots often think,that they're human, and they sort of come to life.,So we put his writings, letters,,his interviews, correspondences,,into a huge database of thousands of pages,,and then used some natural language processing,to allow you to actually have a conversation with him.,And it was kind of spooky, because he would say these things,that just sounded like they really understood you. 
 And this is one of the most exciting projects that we're developing,,which is a little character that's a spokesbot,for friendly artificial intelligence, friendly machine intelligence.,And we're getting this mass-manufactured.,We specked it out to actually be doable,with a very, very low-cost bill of materials,,so that it can become a childhood companion for kids.,Interfacing with the Internet, it gets smarter over the years.,As artificial intelligence evolves, so does his intelligence. 
 Chris Anderson: Thank you so much. That's incredible.,(Applause)I'm here today representing a team of artists and technologists and filmmakers,that worked together on a remarkable film project for the last four years.,And along the way they created a breakthrough in computer visualization. 
 So I want to show you a clip of the film now.,Hopefully it won't stutter.,And if we did our jobs well, you won't know that we were even involved. 
 Voice (Video): I don't know how it's possible ...,but you seem to have more hair. 
 Brad Pitt: What if I told you that I wasn't getting older ...,but I was getting younger than everybody else? 
 I was born with some form of disease. 
 Voice: What kind of disease? 
 BP: I was born old. 
 Man: I'm sorry. 
 BP: No need to be. There's nothing wrong with old age. 
 Girl: Are you sick? 
 BP: I heard momma and Tizzy whisper,,and they said I was gonna die soon.,But ... maybe not. 
 Girl: You're different than anybody I've ever met. 
 BB: There were many changes ...,some you could see, some you couldn't.,Hair started growing in all sorts of places,,along with other things.,I felt pretty good, considering. 
 Ed Ulbrich: That was a clip from "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.",Many of you, maybe you've seen it or you've heard of the story,,but what you might not know,is that for nearly the first hour of the film,,the main character, Benjamin Button, who's played by Brad Pitt,,is completely computer-generated from the neck up.,Now, there's no use of prosthetic makeup,or photography of Brad superimposed over another actor's body.,We've created a completely digital human head. 
 So I'd like to start with a little bit of history on the project.,This is based on an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story.,It's about a man who's born old and lives his life in reverse.,Now, this movie has floated around Hollywood,for well over half a century,,and we first got involved with the project in the early '90s,,with Ron Howard as the director.,We took a lot of meetings and we seriously considered it.,But at the time we had to throw in the towel.,It was deemed impossible.,It was beyond the technology of the day to depict a man aging backwards.,The human form, in particular the human head,,has been considered the Holy Grail of our industry. 
 The project came back to us about a decade later,,and this time with a director named David Fincher.,Now, Fincher is an interesting guy.,David is fearless of technology,,and he is absolutely tenacious.,And David won't take "no.",And David believed, like we do in the visual effects industry,,that anything is possible,as long as you have enough time, resources and, of course, money.,And so David had an interesting take on the film,,and he threw a challenge at us.,He wanted the main character of the film to be played,from the cradle to the grave by one actor.,It happened to be this guy. 
 We went through a process of elimination and a process of discovery,with David, and we ruled out, of course, swapping actors.,That was one idea: that we would have different actors,,and we would hand off from actor to actor. 
 We even ruled out the idea of using makeup.,We realized that prosthetic makeup just wouldn't hold up,,particularly in close-up.,And makeup is an additive process. You have to build the face up.,And David wanted to carve deeply into Brad's face,to bring the aging to this character.,He needed to be a very sympathetic character.,So we decided to cast a series of little people,that would play the different bodies of Benjamin,at the different increments of his life,and that we would in fact create a computer-generated version of Brad's head,,aged to appear as Benjamin,,and attach that to the body of the real actor.,Sounded great. 
 Of course, this was the Holy Grail of our industry,,and the fact that this guy is a global icon didn't help either,,because I'm sure if any of you ever stand in line at the grocery store,,you know -- we see his face constantly.,So there really was no tolerable margin of error.,There were two studios involved: Warner Brothers and Paramount.,And they both believed this would make an amazing film, of course,,but it was a very high-risk proposition.,There was lots of money and reputations at stake.,But we believed that we had a very solid methodology,that might work ... 
 But despite our verbal assurances,,they wanted some proof.,And so, in 2004, they commissioned us to do a screen test of Benjamin.,And we did it in about five weeks.,But we used lots of cheats and shortcuts.,We basically put something together to get through the meeting.,I'll roll that for you now. This was the first test for Benjamin Button.,And in here, you can see, that's a computer-generated head --,pretty good -- attached to the body of an actor.,And it worked. And it gave the studio great relief.,After many years of starts and stops on this project,,and making that tough decision,,they finally decided to greenlight the movie.,And I can remember, actually, when I got the phone call to congratulate us,,to say the movie was a go,,I actually threw up.,(Laughter),You know, this is some tough stuff. 
 So we started to have early team meetings,,and we got everybody together,,and it was really more like therapy in the beginning,,convincing each other and reassuring each other that we could actually undertake this.,We had to hold up an hour of a movie with a character.,And it's not a special effects film; it has to be a man.,We really felt like we were in a -- kind of a 12-step program.,And of course, the first step is: admit you've got a problem. (Laughter),So we had a big problem:,we didn't know how we were going to do this.,But we did know one thing.,Being from the visual effects industry,,we, with David, believed that we now had enough time,,enough resources, and, God, we hoped we had enough money.,And we had enough passion to will the processes and technology into existence. 
 So, when you're faced with something like that,,of course you've got to break it down.,You take the big problem and you break it down into smaller pieces,and you start to attack that.,So we had three main areas that we had to focus on.,We needed to make Brad look a lot older --,needed to age him 45 years or so.,And we also needed to make sure that we could take Brad's idiosyncrasies,,his little tics, the little subtleties that make him who he is,and have that translate through our process,so that it appears in Benjamin on the screen. 
 And we also needed to create a character,that could hold up under, really, all conditions.,He needed to be able to walk in broad daylight,,at nighttime, under candlelight,,he had to hold an extreme close-up,,he had to deliver dialogue,,he had to be able to run, he had to be able to sweat,,he had to be able to take a bath, to cry,,he even had to throw up.,Not all at the same time --,but he had to, you know, do all of those things. 
 And the work had to hold up for almost the first hour of the movie.,We did about 325 shots.,So we needed a system that would allow Benjamin,to do everything a human being can do.,And we realized that there was a giant chasm,between the state of the art of technology in 2004,and where we needed it to be. 
 So we focused on motion capture.,I'm sure many of you have seen motion capture.,The state of the art at the time,was something called marker-based motion capture.,I'll give you an example here.,It's basically the idea of, you wear a leotard,,and they put some reflective markers on your body,,and instead of using cameras,,there're infrared sensors around a volume,,and those infrared sensors track the three-dimensional position,of those markers in real time.,And then animators can take the data of the motion of those markers,and apply them to a computer-generated character.,You can see the computer characters on the right,are having the same complex motion as the dancers. 
 But we also looked at numbers of other films at the time,that were using facial marker tracking,,and that's the idea of putting markers on the human face,and doing the same process.,And as you can see, it gives you a pretty crappy performance.,That's not terribly compelling.,And what we realized,was that what we needed,was the information that was going on between the markers.,We needed the subtleties of the skin.,We needed to see skin moving over muscle moving over bone.,We needed creases and dimples and wrinkles and all of those things. 
 Our first revelation was to completely abort and walk away from,the technology of the day, the status quo, the state of the art.,So we aborted using motion capture.,And we were now well out of our comfort zone,,and in uncharted territory.,So we were left with this idea,that we ended up calling "technology stew.",We started to look out in other fields.,The idea was that we were going to find,nuggets or gems of technology,that come from other industries like medical imaging,,the video game space,,and re-appropriate them.,And we had to create kind of a sauce.,And the sauce was code in software,that we'd written to allow these disparate pieces of technology,to come together and work as one. 
 Initially, we came across some remarkable research,done by a gentleman named Dr. Paul Ekman in the early '70s.,He believed that he could, in fact,,catalog the human face.,And he came up with this idea of Facial Action Coding System, or FACS.,He believed that there were 70 basic poses,or shapes of the human face,,and that those basic poses or shapes of the face,can be combined to create infinite possibilities,of everything the human face is capable of doing.,And of course, these transcend age, race, culture, gender.,So this became the foundation of our research as we went forward. 
 And then we came across some remarkable technology,called Contour.,And here you can see a subject having phosphorus makeup,stippled on her face.,And now what we're looking at is really creating a surface capture,as opposed to a marker capture.,The subject stands in front of a computer array of cameras,,and those cameras can, frame-by-frame,,reconstruct the geometry of exactly what the subject's doing at the moment.,So, effectively, you get 3D data in real time of the subject.,And if you look in a comparison,,on the left, we see what volumetric data gives us,and on the right you see what markers give us.,So, clearly, we were in a substantially better place for this.,But these were the early days of this technology,,and it wasn't really proven yet.,We measure complexity and fidelity of data,in terms of polygonal count.,And so, on the left, we were seeing 100,000 polygons.,We could go up into the millions of polygons.,It seemed to be infinite. 
 This was when we had our "Aha!",This was the breakthrough.,This is when we're like, "OK, we're going to be OK,,This is actually going to work.",And the "Aha!" was, what if we could take Brad Pitt,,and we could put Brad in this device,,and use this Contour process,,and we could stipple on this phosphorescent makeup,and put him under the black lights,,and we could, in fact, scan him in real time,performing Ekman's FACS poses.,Right? So, effectively,,we ended up with a 3D database,of everything Brad Pitt's face is capable of doing.,(Laughter) 
 From there, we actually carved up those faces,into smaller pieces and components of his face.,So we ended up with literally thousands and thousands and thousands of shapes,,a complete database of all possibilities,that his face is capable of doing. 
 Now, that's great, except we had him at age 44.,We need to put another 40 years on him at this point.,We brought in Rick Baker,,and Rick is one of the great makeup and special effects gurus,of our industry.,And we also brought in a gentleman named Kazu Tsuji,,and Kazu Tsuji is one of the great photorealist sculptors of our time.,And we commissioned them to make a maquette,,or a bust, of Benjamin.,So, in the spirit of "The Great Unveiling" -- I had to do this --,I had to unveil something.,So this is Ben 80.,We created three of these:,there's Ben 80, there's Ben 70, there's Ben 60.,And this really became the template for moving forward. 
 Now, this was made from a life cast of Brad.,So, in fact, anatomically, it is correct.,The eyes, the jaw, the teeth:,everything is in perfect alignment with what the real guy has.,We have these maquettes scanned into the computer,at very high resolution --,enormous polygonal count.,And so now we had three age increments of Benjamin,in the computer. 
 But we needed to get a database of him doing more than that.,We went through this process, then, called retargeting.,This is Brad doing one of the Ekman FACS poses.,And here's the resulting data that comes from that,,the model that comes from that.,Retargeting is the process of transposing that data,onto another model.,And because the life cast, or the bust -- the maquette -- of Benjamin,was made from Brad,,we could transpose the data of Brad at 44,onto Brad at 87.,So now, we had a 3D database of everything Brad Pitt's face can do,at age 87, in his 70s and in his 60s. 
 Next we had to go into the shooting process.,So while all that's going on,,we're down in New Orleans and locations around the world.,And we shot our body actors,,and we shot them wearing blue hoods.,So these are the gentleman who played Benjamin.,And the blue hoods helped us with two things:,one, we could easily erase their heads;,and we also put tracking markers on their heads,so we could recreate the camera motion,and the lens optics from the set. 
 But now we needed to get Brad's performance to drive our virtual Benjamin.,And so we edited the footage that was shot on location,with the rest of the cast and the body actors,and about six months later,we brought Brad onto a sound stage in Los Angeles,and he watched on the screen.,His job, then, was to become Benjamin.,And so we looped the scenes.,He watched again and again.,We encouraged him to improvise.,And he took Benjamin into interesting and unusual places,that we didn't think he was going to go.,We shot him with four HD cameras,so we'd get multiple views of him,and then David would choose the take of Brad being Benjamin,that he thought best matched the footage,with the rest of the cast. 
 From there we went into a process called image analysis.,And so here, you can see again, the chosen take.,And you are seeing, now, that data being transposed on to Ben 87.,And so, what's interesting about this is,we used something called image analysis,,which is taking timings from different components of Benjamin's face.,And so we could choose, say, his left eyebrow.,And the software would tell us that, well,,in frame 14 the left eyebrow begins to move from here to here,,and it concludes moving in frame 32.,And so we could choose numbers of positions on the face,to pull that data from. 
 And then, the sauce I talked about with our technology stew --,that secret sauce was, effectively, software that allowed us to,match the performance footage of Brad,in live action with our database of aged Benjamin,,the FACS shapes that we had.,On a frame-by-frame basis,,we could actually reconstruct a 3D head,that exactly matched the performance of Brad. 
 So this was how the finished shot appeared in the film.,And here you can see the body actor.,And then this is what we called the "dead head," no reference to Jerry Garcia. 
 And then here's the reconstructed performance,now with the timings of the performance.,And then, again, the final shot.,It was a long process.,(Applause) 
 The next section here, I'm going to just blast through this,,because we could do a whole TEDTalk on the next several slides. 
 We had to create a lighting system.,So really, a big part of our processes was creating a lighting environment,for every single location that Benjamin had to appear,so that we could put Ben's head into any scene,and it would exactly match the lighting that's on the other actors,in the real world. 
 We also had to create an eye system.,We found the old adage, you know,,"The eyes are the window to the soul,",absolutely true.,So the key here was to keep everybody looking in Ben's eyes.,And if you could feel the warmth, and feel the humanity,,and feel his intent coming through the eyes,,then we would succeed.,So we had one person focused on the eye system,for almost two full years. 
 We also had to create a mouth system.,We worked from dental molds of Brad.,We had to age the teeth over time. 
 We also had to create an articulating tongue that allowed him to enunciate his words.,There was a whole system written in software to articulate the tongue.,We had one person devoted to the tongue for about nine months.,He was very popular. 
 Skin displacement: another big deal.,The skin had to be absolutely accurate.,He's also in an old age home, he's in a nursing home,around other old people,,so he had to look exactly the same as the others.,So, lots of work on skin deformation,,you can see in some of these cases it works,,in some cases it looks bad.,This is a very, very, very early test in our process.,So, effectively we created a digital puppet,that Brad Pitt could operate with his own face.,There were no animators necessary to come in and interpret behavior,or enhance his performance. 
 There was something that we encountered, though,,that we ended up calling "the digital Botox effect.",So, as things went through this process,,Fincher would always say, "It sandblasts the edges off of the performance.",And thing our process and the technology couldn't do,,is they couldn't understand intent,,the intent of the actor.,So it sees a smile as a smile.,It doesn't recognize an ironic smile, or a happy smile,,or a frustrated smile.,So it did take humans to kind of push it one way or another. 
 But we ended up calling the entire process,and all the technology "emotion capture,",as opposed to just motion capture.,Take another look. 
 Brad Pitt: Well, I heard momma and Tizzy whisper,,and they said I was gonna die soon,,but ... maybe not. 
 EU: That's how to create a digital human in 18 minutes.,(Applause) 
 A couple of quick factoids;,it really took 155 people over two years,,and we didn't even talk about 60 hairstyles and an all-digital haircut.,But, that is Benjamin. Thank you.There's a great big elephant in the room called the economy.,So let's start talking about that.,I wanted to give you a current picture of the economy.,That's what I have behind myself. 
 (Laughter) 
 But of course what we have to remember is this.,And what you have to think about is,,when you're dancing in the flames, what's next?,So what I'm going to try to do in the next 17 and a half minutes,is I'm going to talk first about the flames --,where we are in the economy --,and then I'm going to take three trends,that have taken place at TED over the last 25 years,and that will take place in this conference,and I will try and bring them together.,And I will try and give you a sense of what the ultimate reboot looks like.,Those three trends are,the ability to engineer cells,,the ability to engineer tissues,,and robots.,And somehow it will all make sense. 
 But anyway, let's start with the economy.,There's a couple of really big problems that are still sitting there.,One is leverage.,And the problem with leverage is,it makes the U.S. financial system look like this. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, a normal commercial bank has nine to 10 times leverage.,That means for every dollar you deposit, it loans out about nine or 10.,A normal investment bank is not a deposit bank,,it's an investment bank;,it has 15 to 20 times.,It turns out that B of A in September had 32 times.,And your friendly Citibank had 47 times.,Oops.,That means every bad loan goes bad 47 times over.,And that, of course, is the reason why all of you,are making such generous and wonderful donations,to these nice folks.,And as you think about that,,you've got to wonder: so what do banks have in store for you now?,(Laughter),It ain't pretty. 
 The government, meanwhile, has been acting like Santa Claus.,We all love Santa Claus, right?,But the problem with Santa Clause is,,if you look at the mandatory spending of what these folks have been doing,and promising folks,,it turned out that in 1967, 38 percent was mandatory spending,on what we call "entitlements.",And then by 2007 it was 68 percent.,And we weren't supposed to run into 100 percent until about 2030.,Except we've been so busy giving away a trillion here, a trillion there,,that we've brought that date of reckoning forward,to about 2017.,And we thought we were going to be able to lay these debts off on our kids,,but, guess what?,We're going to start to pay them.,And the problem with this stuff is, now that the bill's come due,,it turns out Santa isn't quite as cute when it's summertime.,Right? 
 (Laughter) 
 Here's some advice from one of the largest investors in the United States.,This guy runs the China Investment Corporation.,He is the main buyer of U.S. Treasury bonds.,And he gave an interview in December.,Here's his first bit of advice.,And here's his second bit of advice.,And, by the way,,the Chinese Prime Minister reiterated this at Davos last Sunday.,This stuff is getting serious enough,that if we don't start paying attention to the deficit,,we're going to end up losing the dollar.,And then all bets are off. 
 Let me show you what it looks like.,I think I can safely say,that I'm the only trillionaire in this room.,This is an actual bill.,And it's 10 triliion dollars.,The only problem with this bill is it's not really worth very much.,That was eight bucks last week, four bucks this week,,a buck next week.,And that's what happens to currencies when you don't stand behind them.,So the next time somebody as cute as this shows up on your doorstep,,and sometimes this creature's called Chrysler and sometimes Ford and sometimes ... whatever you want --,you've just got to say no.,And you've got to start banishing a word that's called "entitlement.",And the reason we have to do that in the short term,is because we have just run out of cash. 
 If you look at the federal budget, this is what it looks like.,The orange slice is what's discretionary.,Everything else is mandated.,It makes no difference if we cut out the bridges to Alaska in the overall scheme of things.,So what we have to start thinking about doing,is capping our medical spending,because that's a monster that's simply going to eat the entire budget.,We've got to start thinking about asking people,to retire a little bit later.,If you're 60 to 65 you retire on time.,Your 401(k) just got nailed.,If you're 50 to 60 we want you to work two years more.,If you're under 50 we want you to work four more years.,The reason why that's reasonable is,,when your grandparents were given Social Security,,they got it at 65 and were expected to check out at 68.,Sixty-eight is young today.,We've also got to cut the military about three percent a year. 
 We've got to limit other mandatory spending.,We've got to quit borrowing as much,,because otherwise the interest is going to eat that whole pie.,And we've got to end up with a smaller government.,And if we don't start changing this trend line,,we are going to lose the dollar,and start to look like Iceland.,I got what you're thinking.,This is going to happen when hell freezes over.,But let me remind you this December it did snow in Vegas. 
 (Laughter) 
 Here's what happens if you don't address this stuff.,So, Japan had a fiscal real estate crisis,back in the late '80s.,And its 225 largest companies today,are worth one quarter of what they were 18 years ago.,We don't fix this now,,how would you like to see a Dow 3,500 in 2026?,Because that's the consequence of not dealing with this stuff.,And unless you want this person,to not just become the CFO of Florida, but the United States,,we'd better deal with this stuff.,That's the short term. That's the flame part.,That's the financial crisis. 
 Now, right behind the financial crisis there's a second and bigger wave,that we need to talk about.,That wave is much larger, much more powerful,,and that's of course the wave of technology.,And what's really important in this stuff is,,as we cut, we also have to grow.,Among other things, because startup companies,are .02 percent of U.S. GDP investmentm,and they're about 17.8 percent of output.,It's groups like that in this room that generate the future of the U.S. economy.,And that's what we've got to keep growing.,We don't have to keep growing these bridges to nowhere.,So let's bring a romance novelist into this conversation.,And that's where these three trends come together.,That's where the ability to engineer microbes,,the ability to engineer tissues,,and the ability to engineer robots,begin to lead to a reboot.,And let me recap some of the stuff you've seen. 
 Craig Venter showed up last year,and showed you the first fully programmable cell that acts like hardware,where you can insert DNA and have it boot up as a different species.,In parallel, the folks at MIT,have been building a standard registry of biological parts.,So think of it as a Radio Shack for biology.,You can go out and get your proteins, your RNA, your DNA, whatever.,And start building stuff.,In 2006 they brought together high school students and college students,and started to build these little odd creatures.,They just happened to be alive instead of circuit boards. 
 Here was one of the first things they built.,So, cells have this cycle.,First they don't grow.,Then they grow exponentially.,Then they stop growing.,Graduate students wanted a way of telling which stage they were in.,So they engineered these cells,so that when they're growing in the exponential phase,,they would smell like wintergreen.,And when they stopped growing they would smell like bananas.,And you could tell very easily when your experiment was working,and wasn't, and where it was in the phase. 
 This got a bit more complicated two years later.,Twenty-one countries came together. Dozens of teams.,They started competing.,The team from Rice University started to engineer the substance in red wine,that makes red wine good for you,into beer.,So you take resveratrol and you put it into beer.,Of course, one of the judges is wandering by, and he goes,,"Wow! Cancer-fighting beer! There is a God." 
 (Laughter) 
 The team from Taiwan was a little bit more ambitious.,They tried to engineer bacterias in such a way,that they would act as your kidneys.,Four years ago, I showed you this picture.,And people oohed and ahhed,,because Cliff Tabin had been able to grow an extra wing on a chicken.,And that was very cool stuff back then.,But now moving from bacterial engineering to tissue engineering,,let me show you what's happened in that period of time. 
 Two years ago, you saw this creature.,An almost-extinct animal from Xochimilco, Mexico,called an axolotl,that can re-generate its limbs.,You can freeze half its heart. It regrows.,You can freeze half the brain. It regrows.,It's almost like leaving Congress.,(Laughter),But now, you don't have to have the animal itself to regenerate,,because you can build cloned mice molars in Petri dishes.,And, of course if you can build mice molars in Petri dishes,,you can grow human molars in Petri dishes.,This should not surprise you, right?,I mean, you're born with no teeth.,You give away all your teeth to the tooth fairy.,You re-grow a set of teeth.,But then if you lose one of those second set of teeth, they don't regrow,,unless, if you're a lawyer. 
 (Laughter) 
 But, of course, for most of us,,we know how to grow teeth, and therefore we can take adult stem teeth,,put them on a biodegradable mold, re-grow a tooth,,and simply implant it.,And we can do it with other things.,So, a Spanish woman who was dying of T.B. had a donor trachea,,they took all the cells off the trachea,,they spraypainted her stem cells onto that cartilage.,She regrew her own trachea,,and 72 hours later it was implanted.,She's now running around with her kids.,This is going on in Tony Atala's lab in Wake Forest,where he is re-growing ears for injured soldiers,,and he's also re-growing bladders.,So there are now nine women walking around Boston,with re-grown bladders,,which is much more pleasant than walking around with a whole bunch of plastic bags,for the rest of your life. 
 This is kind of getting boring, right?,I mean, you understand where this story's going.,But, I mean it gets more interesting.,Last year, this group was able to take all the cells off a heart,,leaving just the cartilage.,Then, they sprayed stem cells onto that heart, from a mouse.,Those stem cells self-organized, and that heart started to beat.,Life happens. 
 This may be one of the ultimate papers.,This was done in Japan and in the U.S., published at the same time,,and it rebooted skin cells into stem cells, last year.,That meant that you can take the stuff right here,,and turn it into almost anything in your body.,And this is becoming common, it's moving very quickly,,it's moving in a whole series of places. 
 Third trend: robots.,Those of us of a certain age grew up expecting that by now,we would have Rosie the Robot from "The Jetsons" in our house.,And all we've got is a Roomba.,(Laughter),We also thought we'd have this robot to warn us of danger.,Didn't happen.,And these were robots engineered for a flat world, right?,So, Rosie runs around on skates,and the other one ran on flat threads.,If you don't have a flat world, that's not good,,which is why the robot's we're designing today are a little different. 
 This is Boston Dynamics' "BigDog.",And this is about as close as you can get to a physical Turing test.,O.K., so let me remind you, a Turing test is where you've got a wall,,you're talking to somebody on the other side of the wall,,and when you don't know if that thing is human or animal --,that's when computers have reached human intelligence.,This is not an intelligence Turing rest,,but this is as close as you can get to a physical Turing test.,And this stuff is moving very quickly,,and by the way, that thing can carry about 350 pounds of weight.,These are not the only interesting robots.,You've also got flies, the size of flies,,that are being made by Robert Wood at Harvard.,You've got Stickybots that are being made at Stanford.,And as you bring these things together,,as you bring cells, biological tissue engineering and mechanics together,,you begin to get some really odd questions. 
 In the last Olympics, this gentleman,,who had several world records in the Special Olympics,,tried to run in the normal Olympics.,The only issue with Oscar Pistorius,is he was born without bones in the lower part of his legs.,He came within about a second of qualifying.,He sued to be allowed to run,,and he won the suit,,but didn't qualify by time.,Next Olympics, you can bet that Oscar, or one of Oscar's successors,,is going to make the time.,And two or three Olympics after that, they are going to be unbeatable. 
 And as you bring these trends together, and as you think of what it means,to take people who are profoundly deaf, who can now begin to hear --,I mean, remember the evolution of hearing aids, right?,I mean, your grandparents had these great big cones,,and then your parents had these odd boxes,that would squawk at odd times during dinner,,and now we have these little buds that nobody sees.,And now you have cochlear implants,that go into people's heads and allow the deaf to begin to hear.,Now, they can't hear as well as you and I can.,But, in 10 or 15 machine generations they will,,and these are machine generations, not human generations.,And about two or three years after they can hear as well as you and I can,,they'll be able to hear maybe how bats sing, or how whales talk,,or how dogs talk, and other types of tonal scales.,They'll be able to focus their hearing,,they'll be able to increase the sensitivity, decrease the sensitivity,,do a series of things that we can't do. 
 And the same thing is happening in eyes.,This is a group in Germany that's beginning to engineer eyes,so that people who are blind can begin to see light and dark.,Very primitive.,And then they'll be able to see shape.,And then they'll be able to see color, and then they'll be able to see in definition,,and one day, they'll see as well as you and I can.,And a couple of years after that, they'll be able to see in ultraviolet,,they'll be able to see in infrared, they'll be able to focus their eyes,,they'll be able to come into a microfocus.,They'll do stuff you and I can't do.,All of these things are coming together,,and it's a particularly important thing to understand,,as we worry about the flames of the present,,to keep an eye on the future. 
 And, of course, the future is looking back 200 years,,because next week is the 200th anniversary of Darwin's birth.,And it's the 150th anniversary of the publication of "The Origin of Species.",And Darwin, of course, argued that evolution is a natural state.,It is a natural state in everything that is alive, including hominids.,There have actually been 22 species of hominids,that have been around, have evolved, have wandered in different places,,have gone extinct.,It is common for hominids to evolve.,And that's the reason why, as you look at the hominid fossil record,,erectus, and heidelbergensis, and floresiensis, and Neanderthals,,and Homo sapiens, all overlap.,The common state of affairs is to have overlapping versions of hominids,,not one. 
 And as you think of the implications of that,,here's a brief history of the universe.,The universe was created 13.7 billion years ago,,and then you created all the stars, and all the planets,,and all the galaxies, and all the Milky Ways.,And then you created Earth about 4.5 billion years ago,,and then you got life about four billion years ago,,and then you got hominids about 0.006 billion years ago,,and then you got our version of hominids about 0.0015 billion years ago.,Ta-dah!,Maybe the reason for thr creation of the universe,,and all the galaxies, and all the planets, and all the energy,,and all the dark energy, and all the rest of stuff,is to create what's in this room.,Maybe not.,That would be a mildly arrogant viewpoint.,(Laughter),So, if that's not the purpose of the universe, then what's next?,(Laughter) 
 I think what we're going to see is we're going to see a different species of hominid.,I think we're going to move from a Homo sapiens into a Homo evolutis.,And I think this isn't 1,000 years out.,I think most of us are going to glance at it,,and our grandchildren are going to begin to live it.,And a Homo evolutis brings together these three trends,into a hominid that takes direct and deliberate control,over the evolution of his species, her species and other species.,And that, of course, would be the ultimate reboot. 
 Thank you very much.,(Applause)Let me talk about India,through the evolution of ideas.,Now I believe this is an interesting way of looking at it,because in every society, especially an open democratic society,,it's only when ideas take root that things change.,Slowly ideas lead to ideology,,lead to policies that lead to actions. 
 In 1930 this country went through a Great Depression,,which led to all the ideas of the state and social security,,and all the other things that happened in Roosevelt's time.,In the 1980s we had the Reagan revolution, which lead to deregulation.,And today, after the global economic crisis,,there was a whole new set of rules,about how the state should intervene.,So ideas change states. 
 And I looked at India and said,,really there are four kinds of ideas,which really make an impact on India.,The first, to my mind,,is what I call as "the ideas that have arrived.",These ideas have brought together something,which has made India happen the way it is today.,The second set of ideas I call "ideas in progress.",Those are ideas which have been accepted,but not implemented yet.,The third set of ideas are what I call as,"ideas that we argue about" --,those are ideas where we have a fight,,an ideological battle about how to do things.,And the fourth thing, which I believe is most important, is,"the ideas that we need to anticipate.",Because when you are a developing country,in the world where you can see the problems that other countries are having,,you can actually anticipate,what that did and do things very differently. 
 Now in India's case I believe there are six ideas,which are responsible for where it has come today.,The first is really the notion of people.,In the '60s and '70s,we thought of people as a burden.,We thought of people as a liability.,Today we talk of people as an asset.,We talk of people as human capital.,And I believe this change in the mindset,,of looking at people as something of a burden,to human capital,,has been one of the fundamental changes in the Indian mindset.,And this change in thinking of human capital,is linked to the fact,that India is going through a demographic dividend.,As healthcare improves,,as infant mortality goes down,,fertility rates start dropping. And India is experiencing that.,India is going to have,a lot of young people with a demographic dividend,for the next 30 years.,What is unique about this demographic dividend,is that India will be the only country in the world,to have this demographic dividend.,In other words, it will be the only young country in an aging world.,And this is very important. At the same time,if you peel away the demographic dividend in India,,there are actually two demographic curves.,One is in the south and in the west of India,,which is already going to be fully expensed by 2015,,because in that part of the country, the fertility rate is,almost equal to that of a West European country.,Then there is the whole northern India,,which is going to be the bulk of the future demographic dividend.,But a demographic dividend is only as good,as the investment in your human capital.,Only if the people have education,,they have good health, they have infrastructure,,they have roads to go to work, they have lights to study at night --,only in those cases can you really get the benefit,of a demographic dividend.,In other words, if you don't really invest in the human capital,,the same demographic dividend,can be a demographic disaster.,Therefore India is at a critical point,where either it can leverage its demographic dividend,or it can lead to a demographic disaster. 
 The second thing in India has been the change in,the role of entrepreneurs.,When India got independence entrepreneurs were seen,as a bad lot, as people who would exploit.,But today, after 60 years, because of the rise of entrepreneurship,,entrepreneurs have become role models,,and they are contributing hugely to the society.,This change has contributed,to the vitality and the whole economy. 
 The third big thing I believe that has changed India,is our attitude towards the English language.,English language was seen as a language of the imperialists.,But today, with globalization,,with outsourcing, English has become a language of aspiration.,This has made it something that everybody wants to learn.,And the fact that we have English is now becoming,a huge strategic asset. 
 The next thing is technology.,Forty years back, computers were seen,as something which was forbidding, something which was intimidating,,something that reduced jobs.,Today we live in a country,which sells eight million mobile phones a month,,of which 90 percent of those mobile phones,are prepaid phones,because people don't have credit history.,Forty percent of those prepaid phones,are recharged at less than 20 cents at each recharge.,That is the scale at which,technology has liberated and made it accessible.,And therefore technology has gone,from being seen as something forbidding,and intimidating to something that is empowering.,Twenty years back,,when there was a report on bank computerization,,they didn't name the report as,a report on computers,,they call them as "ledger posting machines.",They didn't want the unions to believe that they were actually computers.,And when they wanted to have more advanced, more powerful computers,they called them "advanced ledger posting machines.",So we have come a long way from those days,where the telephone has become an instrument of empowerment,,and really has changed the way Indians think of technology. 
 And then I think the other point,is that Indians today are far more,comfortable with globalization.,Again, after having lived for more than 200 years,under the East India Company and under imperial rule,,Indians had a very natural reaction towards globalization,believing it was a form of imperialism.,But today, as Indian companies go abroad,,as Indians come and work all over the world,,Indians have gained a lot more confidence,and have realized that globalization is something they can participate in.,And the fact that the demographics are in our favor,,because we are the only young country in an aging world,,makes globalization all the more attractive to Indians. 
 And finally, India has had,the deepening of its democracy.,When democracy came to India 60 years back,it was an elite concept.,It was a bunch of people who wanted to bring in democracy,because they wanted to bring in the idea of,universal voting and parliament and constitution and so forth.,But today democracy has become a bottom-up process,where everybody has realized,the benefits of having a voice,,the benefits of being in an open society.,And therefore democracy has become embedded. 
 I believe these six factors --,the rise of the notion of population as human capital,,the rise of Indian entrepreneurs,,the rise of English as a language of aspiration,,technology as something empowering,,globalization as a positive factor,,and the deepening of democracy -- has contributed,to why India is today growing,at rates it has never seen before. 
 But having said that,,then we come to what I call as ideas in progress.,Those are the ideas where there is no argument in a society,,but you are not able to implement those things.,And really there are four things here.,One is the question of education.,For some reason, whatever reason -- lack of money,,lack of priorities, because of religion having an older culture --,primary education was never given the focus it required.,But now I believe it's reached a point,where it has become very important.,Unfortunately the government schools don't function,,so children are going to private schools today.,Even in the slums of India,more than 50 percent of urban kids are going into private schools.,So there is a big challenge in getting the schools to work.,But having said that, there is an enormous desire,among everybody, including the poor, to educate their children.,So I believe primary education is an idea,which is arrived but not yet implemented. 
 Similarly, infrastructure --,for a long time, infrastructure was not a priority.,Those of you who have been to India have seen that.,It's certainly not like China.,But today I believe finally infrastructure is something,which is agreed upon and which people want to implement.,It is reflected in the political statements.,20 years back the political slogan was, "Roti, kapada, makaan,",which meant, "Food, clothing and shelter.",And today's political slogan is, "Bijli, sadak, pani,",which means "Electricity, water and roads.",And that is a change in the mindset,where infrastructure is now accepted.,So I do believe this is an idea which has arrived,,but simply not implemented. 
 The third thing is again cities.,It's because Gandhi believed in villages,and because the British ruled from the cities,,therefore Nehru thought of New Delhi as an un-Indian city.,For a long time we have neglected our cities.,And that is reflected in the kinds of situations that you see.,But today, finally, after economic reforms,,and economic growth,,I think the notion that cities are engines,of economic growth,,cities are engines of creativity,,cities are engines of innovation,,have finally been accepted.,And I think now you're seeing the move towards improving our cities.,Again, an idea which is arrived, but not yet implemented. 
 The final thing is the notion of India as a single market --,because when you didn't think of India as a market,,you didn't really bother about a single market, because it didn't really matter.,And therefore you had a situation,where every state had its own market for products.,Every province had its own market for agriculture.,Increasingly now the policies of,taxation and infrastructure and all that,,are moving towards creating India as a single market.,So there is a form of internal globalization which is happening,,which is as important as external globalization.,These four factors I believe --,the ones of primary education,,infrastructure, urbanization, and single market --,in my view are ideas in India,which have been accepted, but not implemented. 
 Then we have what I believe are the ideas in conflict.,The ideas that we argue about.,These are the arguments we have which cause gridlock.,What are those ideas? One is, I think, are ideological issues.,Because of the historical Indian background, in the caste system,,and because of the fact that there have been many people,who have been left out in the cold,,a lot of the politics is about how to make sure,that we'll address that.,And it leads to reservations and other techniques.,It's also related to the way that we subsidize our people,,and all the left and right arguments that we have.,A lot of the Indian problems are related to the ideology,of caste and other things.,This policy is causing gridlock.,This is one of the factors which needs to be resolved. 
 The second one is the labor policies that we have,,which make it so difficult for,entrepreneurs to create standardized jobs in companies,,that 93 percent of Indian labor,is in the unorganized sector.,They have no benefits: they don't have social security;,they don't have pension; they don't have healthcare; none of those things.,This needs to be fixed because unless you can bring these people,into the formal workforce,,you will end up creating a whole lot of people who are completely disenfranchised.,Therefore we need to create a new set of labor laws,,which are not as onerous as they are today.,At the same time give a policy for a lot more people to be in the formal sector,,and create the jobs for the millions of people that we need to create jobs for. 
 The third thing is our higher education.,Indian higher education is completely regulated.,It's very difficult to start a private university.,It's very difficult for a foreign university to come to India.,As a result of that our higher education,is simply not keeping pace with India's demands.,That is leading to a lot of problems which we need to address. 
 But most important I believe,are the ideas we need to anticipate.,Here India can look at what is happening in the west,and elsewhere, and look at what needs to be done.,The first thing is, we're very fortunate,that technology is at a point,where it is much more advanced,than when other countries had the development.,So we can use technology for governance.,We can use technology for direct benefits.,We can use technology for transparency, and many other things. 
 The second thing is, the health issue.,India has equally horrible,health problems of the higher state of cardiac issue,,the higher state of diabetes, the higher state of obesity.,So there is no point in replacing a set of poor country diseases,with a set of rich country diseases.,Therefore we're to rethink the whole way we look at health.,We really need to put in place a strategy,so that we don't go to the other extreme of health. 
 Similarly today in the West,you're seeing the problem of entitlement --,the cost of social security, the cost of Medicare, the cost of Medicaid.,Therefore when you are a young country,,again you have a chance to put in place a modern pension system,so that you don't create entitlement problems as you grow old. 
 And then again, India does not have the luxury,of making its environment dirty,,because it has to marry environment and development.,Just to give an idea, the world has to stabilize,at something like 20 gigatons per year.,On a population of nine billion,our average carbon emission will have to be about two tons per year.,India is already at two tons per year.,But if India grows at something like eight percent,,income per year per person will go to 16 times by 2050.,So we're saying: income growing at 16 times and no growth in carbon.,Therefore we will fundamentally rethink the way we look at the environment,,the way we look at energy,,the way we create whole new paradigms of development. 
 Now why does this matter to you?,Why does what's happening 10 thousand miles away matter to all of you?,Number one, this matters because,this represents more than a billion people.,A billion people, 1/6th of the world population.,It matters because this is a democracy.,And it is important to prove,that growth and democracy are not incompatible,,that you can have a democracy, that you can have an open society,,and you can have growth.,It's important because if you solve these problems,,you can solve the problems of poverty in the world.,It's important because,you need it to solve the world's environment problems. 
 If we really want to come to a point,,we really want to put a cap on our carbon emission,,we want to really lower the use of energy --,it has to be solved in countries like India.,You know if you look at the development,in the West over 200 years,,the average growth may have been about two percent.,Here we are talking about countries growing at eight to nine percent.,And that makes a huge difference.,When India was growing at about three, 3.5 percent,and the population was growing at two percent,,its per capita income was doubling every 45 years.,When the economic growth goes to eight percent,and population growth drops to 1.5 percent,,then per capita income is doubling every nine years.,In other words, you're certainly fast-forwarding this whole process,of a billion people going to prosperity.,And you must have a clear strategy,which is important for India and important for the world.,That is why I think all of you,should be equally concerned with it as I am.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)♫ I think I'm ready to do my thing ♫

 (Applause) 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I thought I'd begin with a scene of war.,There was little to warn of the danger ahead.,The Iraqi insurgent had placed the IED,,an Improvised Explosive Device,,along the side of the road with great care.,By 2006, there were more than 2,500,of these attacks every single month,,and they were the leading cause of,casualties among American soldiers,and Iraqi civilians.,The team that was hunting for this IED,is called an EOD team—,Explosives Ordinance Disposal—and,they're the pointy end of the spear in the,American effort to suppress these roadside bombs.,Each EOD team goes out on about,600 of these bomb calls every year,,defusing about two bombs a day.,Perhaps the best sign of how valuable they,are to the war effort, is that,the Iraqi insurgents put a $50,000 bounty,on the head of a single EOD soldier. 
 Unfortunately, this particular call,would not end well.,By the time the soldier advanced close,enough to see the telltale wires,of the bomb, it exploded in a wave of flame.,Now, depending how close you are,and how much explosive has been packed,into that bomb, it can cause death,or injury. You have to be as far as,50 yards away to escape that.,The blast is so strong it can even break,your limbs, even if you're not hit.,That soldier had been on top of the bomb. 
 And so when the rest of the team advanced,they found little left. And that night the unit's,commander did a sad duty, and he wrote,a condolence letter back to the United,States, and he talked about how hard the,loss had been on his unit, about the fact,that they had lost their bravest soldier,,a soldier who had saved their lives,many a time.,And he apologized,for not being able to bring them home.,But then he talked up the silver lining,that he took away from the loss.,"At least," as he wrote, "when a robot dies,,you don't have to write a letter,to its mother." 
 That scene sounds like science fiction,,but is battlefield reality already.,The soldier in that case,was a 42-pound robot called a PackBot.,The chief's letter went, not to some,farmhouse in Iowa like you see,in the old war movies, but went to,the iRobot Company, which is,named after the Asimov novel,and the not-so-great Will Smith movie,,and... um... (Laughter)...,if you remember that,in that fictional world, robots started out,carrying out mundane chores, and then,they started taking on life-and-death decisions.,That's a reality we face today. 
 What we're going to do is actually just,flash a series of photos behind me that,show you the reality of robots used in war,right now or already at the prototype stage.,It's just to give you a taste.,Another way of putting it is you're not,going to see anything that's powered,by Vulcan technology, or teenage,wizard hormones or anything like that.,This is all real. So why don't we,go ahead and start those pictures. 
 Something big is going on in war today,,and maybe even the history of humanity,itself. The U.S. military went into Iraq with,a handful of drones in the air.,We now have 5,300.,We went in with zero unmanned ground,systems. We now have 12,000.,And the tech term "killer application",takes on new meaning in this space. 
 And we need to remember that we're,talking about the Model T Fords,,the Wright Flyers, compared,to what's coming soon.,That's where we're at right now.,One of the people that I recently met with,was an Air Force three-star general, and he,said basically, where we're headed very,soon is tens of thousands of robots,operating in our conflicts, and these,numbers matter, because we're not just,talking about tens of thousands of today's,robots, but tens of thousands of these,prototypes and tomorrow's robots, because,of course, one of the things that's operating,in technology is Moore's Law,,that you can pack in more and more,computing power into those robots, and so,flash forward around 25 years,,if Moore's Law holds true,,those robots will be close to a billion times,more powerful in their computing than today. 
 And so what that means is the kind of,things that we used to only talk about at,science fiction conventions like Comic-Con,have to be talked about in the halls,of power and places like the Pentagon.,A robots revolution is upon us. 
 Now, I need to be clear here.,I'm not talking about a revolution where you,have to worry about the Governor of,California showing up at your door,,a la the Terminator. (Laughter) 
 When historians look at this period, they're,going to conclude that we're in a different,type of revolution: a revolution in war,,like the invention of the atomic bomb.,But it may be even bigger than that,,because our unmanned systems don't just 
 affect the "how" of war-fighting,,they affect the "who" of fighting,at its most fundamental level.,That is, every previous revolution in war, be,it the machine gun, be it the atomic bomb,,was about a system that either shot faster,,went further, had a bigger boom.,That's certainly the case with robotics, but,they also change the experience of the warrior,and even the very identity of the warrior. 
 Another way of putting this is that,mankind's 5,000-year-old monopoly,on the fighting of war is breaking down,in our very lifetime. I've spent,the last several years going around,meeting with all the players in this field,,from the robot scientists to the science,fiction authors who inspired them to the,19-year-old drone pilots who are fighting,from Nevada, to the four-star generals,who command them, to even the Iraqi,insurgents who they are targeting and what,they think about our systems, and,what I found interesting is not just,their stories, but how their experiences,point to these ripple effects that are going,outwards in our society, in our law,and our ethics, etc. And so what I'd like,to do with my remaining time is basically,flesh out a couple of these. 
 So the first is that the future of war,,even a robotics one, is not going to be,purely an American one.,The U.S. is currently ahead in military,robotics right now, but we know that in,technology there's no such thing as,a permanent first move or advantage.,In a quick show of hands, how many,people in this room still use,Wang Computers? (Laughter),It's the same thing in war. The British and,the French invented the tank.,The Germans figured out how,to use it right, and so what we have to,think about for the U.S. is that we are,ahead right now, but you have,43 other countries out there,working on military robotics, and they,include all the interesting countries like,Russia, China, Pakistan, Iran. 
 And this raises a bigger worry for me.,How do we move forward in this revolution,given the state of our manufacturing,and the state of our science and,mathematics training in our schools?,Or another way of thinking about this is,,what does it mean to go to war increasingly,with soldiers whose hardware is made,in China and software is written in India? 
 But just as software has gone open-source,,so has warfare.,Unlike an aircraft carrier or an atomic bomb,,you don't need a massive manufacturing,system to build robotics. A lot of it is,off the shelf. A lot of it's even do-it-yourself.,One of those things you just saw flashed,before you was a raven drone, the handheld,tossed one. For about a thousand dollars,,you can build one yourself, equivalent to,what the soldiers use in Iraq. 
 That raises another wrinkle when it comes,to war and conflict. Good guys might play,around and work on these as hobby kits,,but so might bad guys.,This cross between robotics and things like,terrorism is going to be fascinating,and even disturbing,,and we've already seen it start. 
 During the war between Israel, a state,,and Hezbollah, a non-state actor,,the non-state actor flew,four different drones against Israel.,There's already a jihadi website,that you can go on and remotely,detonate an IED in Iraq while sitting,at your home computer. 
 And so I think what we're going to see is,two trends take place with this.,First is, you're going to reinforce the power,of individuals against governments,,but then the second is that,we are going to see an expansion,in the realm of terrorism.,The future of it may be a cross between,al Qaeda 2.0 and the,next generation of the Unabomber.,And another way of thinking about this,is the fact that, remember, you don't have,to convince a robot that they're gonna,receive 72 virgins after they die,to convince them to blow themselves up. 
 But the ripple effects of this are going to go,out into our politics. One of the people that,I met with was a former Assistant Secretary of,Defense for Ronald Reagan, and he put it,this way: "I like these systems because,they save American lives, but I worry about,more marketization of wars,,more shock-and-awe talk,,to defray discussion of the costs.,People are more likely to support the use,of force if they view it as costless." 
 Robots for me take certain trends,that are already in play in our body politic,,and maybe take them to,their logical ending point.,We don't have a draft. We don't,have declarations of war anymore.,We don't buy war bonds anymore.,And now we have the fact that we're,converting more and more of our American,soldiers that we would send into harm's,way into machines, and so we may take,those already lowering bars to war,and drop them to the ground. 
 But the future of war is also going to be,a YouTube war.,That is, our new technologies don't merely,remove humans from risk.,They also record everything that they see.,So they don't just delink the public:,they reshape its relationship with war.,There's already several thousand,video clips of combat footage from Iraq,on YouTube right now,,most of it gathered by drones. 
 Now, this could be a good thing.,It could be building connections between,the home front and the war front,as never before.,But remember, this is taking place,in our strange, weird world, and so,inevitably the ability to download these,video clips to, you know, your iPod,or your Zune gives you,the ability to turn it into entertainment. 
 Soldiers have a name for these clips.,They call it war porn.,The typical one that I was sent was,an email that had an attachment of,video of a Predator strike taking out,an enemy site. Missile hits,,bodies burst into the air with the explosion.,It was set to music.,It was set to the pop song,"I Just Want To Fly" by Sugar Ray. 
 This ability to watch more,but experience less creates a wrinkle,in the public's relationship with war.,I think about this with a sports parallel.,It's like the difference between,watching an NBA game, a professional,basketball game on TV, where the athletes,are tiny figures on the screen, and,being at that basketball game in person,and realizing what someone seven feet,really does look like. 
 But we have to remember,,these are just the clips.,These are just the ESPN SportsCenter,version of the game. They lose the context.,They lose the strategy.,They lose the humanity. War just,becomes slam dunks and smart bombs. 
 Now the irony of all this is that,while the future of war may involve,more and more machines,,it's our human psychology that's driving,all of this, it's our human failings,that are leading to these wars. 
 So one example of this that has,big resonance in the policy realm is,how this plays out on our very real,war of ideas that we're fighting,against radical groups.,What is the message that we think we are,sending with these machines versus what,is being received in terms of the message. 
 So one of the people that I met was,a senior Bush Administration official,,who had this to say about,our unmanning of war:,"It plays to our strength. The thing that,scares people is our technology.",But when you go out and meet with people,,for example in Lebanon, it's a very,different story. One of the people,I met with there was a news editor, and,we're talking as a drone is flying above him,,and this is what he had to say.,"This is just another sign of the coldhearted,cruel Israelis and Americans,,who are cowards because,they send out machines to fight us.,They don't want to fight us like real men,,but they're afraid to fight,,so we just have to kill a few of their soldiers,to defeat them." 
 The future of war also is featuring,a new type of warrior,,and it's actually redefining the experience,of going to war.,You can call this a cubicle warrior.,This is what one Predator drone pilot,described of his experience fighting,in the Iraq War while never leaving Nevada.,"You're going to war for 12 hours,,shooting weapons at targets,,directing kills on enemy combatants,,and then you get in the car,and you drive home and within 20 minutes,,you're sitting at the dinner table,talking to your kids about their homework." 
 Now, the psychological balancing,of those experiences is incredibly tough,,and in fact those drone pilots have,higher rates of PTSD than many,of the units physically in Iraq.,But some have worries that this,disconnection will lead to something else,,that it might make the contemplation of war,crimes a lot easier when you have,this distance. "It's like a video game,",is what one young pilot described to me,of taking out enemy troops from afar.,As anyone who's played Grand Theft Auto,knows, we do things in the video world,that we wouldn't do face to face. 
 So much of what you're hearing from me,is that there's another side,to technologic revolutions,,and that it's shaping our present,and maybe will shape our future of war.,Moore's Law is operative,,but so's Murphy's Law.,The fog of war isn't being lifted.,The enemy has a vote. 
 We're gaining incredible new capabilities,,but we're also seeing and experiencing,new human dilemmas. Now,,sometimes these are just "oops" moments,,which is what the head of a robotics,company described it, you just have,"oops" moments. Well, what are,"oops" moments with robots in war?,Well, sometimes they're funny. Sometimes,,they're like that scene from the,Eddie Murphy movie "Best Defense,",playing out in reality, where they tested out,a machine gun-armed robot, and during,the demonstration it started spinning,in a circle and pointed its machine gun,at the reviewing stand of VIPs.,Fortunately the weapon wasn't loaded,and no one was hurt, but other times,"oops" moments are tragic,,such as last year in South Africa, where,an anti-aircraft cannon had a,"software glitch," and actually did turn on,and fired, and nine soldiers were killed. 
 We have new wrinkles in the laws of war,and accountability. What do we do,with things like unmanned slaughter?,What is unmanned slaughter?,We've already had three instances of,Predator drone strikes where we thought,we got bin Laden, and it turned out,not to be the case.,And this is where we're at right now.,This is not even talking about armed,,autonomous systems,with full authority to use force.,And do not believe that that isn't coming.,During my research I came across,four different Pentagon projects,on different aspects of that. 
 And so you have this question:,what does this lead to issues like,war crimes? Robots are emotionless, so,they don't get upset if their buddy is killed.,They don't commit crimes of rage,and revenge.,But robots are emotionless.,They see an 80-year-old grandmother,in a wheelchair the same way they see,a T-80 tank: they're both,just a series of zeroes and ones.,And so we have this question to figure out:,How do we catch up our 20th century,laws of war, that are so old right now,that they could qualify for Medicare,,to these 21st century technologies? 
 And so, in conclusion, I've talked about,what seems the future of war,,but notice that I've only used,real world examples and you've only seen,real world pictures and videos.,And so this sets a great challenge for,all of us that we have to worry about well,before you have to worry about your,Roomba sucking the life away from you.,Are we going to let the fact that what's,unveiling itself right now in war,sounds like science fiction and therefore,keeps us in denial?,Are we going to face the reality,of 21st century war?,Is our generation going to make the same,mistake that a past generation did,with atomic weaponry, and not deal with,the issues that surround it until,Pandora's box is already opened up? 
 Now, I could be wrong on this, and,one Pentagon robot scientist told me,that I was. He said, "There's no real,social, ethical, moral issues when it comes,to robots.,That is," he added, "unless the machine,kills the wrong people repeatedly.,Then it's just a product recall issue." 
 And so the ending point for this is,that actually, we can turn to Hollywood.,A few years ago, Hollywood gathered,all the top characters and created,a list of the top 100 heroes and,top 100 villains of all of Hollywood history,,the characters that represented the best,and worst of humanity.,Only one character made it onto both lists:,The Terminator, a robot killing machine.,And so that points to the fact that,our machines can be used,for both good and evil, but for me,it points to the fact that there's a duality,of humans as well. 
 This week is a celebration,of our creativity. Our creativity,has taken our species to the stars.,Our creativity has created works of arts,and literature to express our love.,And now, we're using our creativity,in a certain direction, to build fantastic,machines with incredible capabilities,,maybe even one day,an entirely new species.,But one of the main reasons that we're,doing that is because of our drive,to destroy each other, and so the question,we all should ask:,is it our machines, or is it us,that's wired for war? 
 Thank you. (Applause)So sometimes I get invited to give weird talks.,I got invited to speak to the people,who dress up in big stuffed animal costumes,to perform at sporting events.,Unfortunately I couldn't go.,But it got me thinking about,the fact that these guys, at least most of them,,know what it is that they do for a living.,What they do is they dress up,as stuffed animals and entertain people at sporting events. 
 Shortly after that I got invited,to speak at the convention of the people,who make balloon animals.,And again, I couldn't go. But it's a fascinating group. They make balloon animals.,There is a big schism between the ones who make,gospel animals and porn animals, but --,(Laughter),they do a lot of really cool stuff with balloons.,Sometimes they get in trouble, but not often.,And the other thing about these guys,is, they also know what they do for a living.,They make balloon animals. 
 But what do we do for a living?,What exactly to the people watching this do every day?,And I want to argue that what we do,is we try to change everything.,That we try to find a piece of the status quo --,something that bothers us, something that needs to be improved,,something that is itching to be changed -- and we change it.,We try to make big, permanent, important change.,But we don't think about it that way.,And we haven't spent a lot of time talking about,what that process is like.,And I've been studying it for a couple years.,And I want to share a couple stories with you today. 
 First, about a guy named Nathan Winograd.,Nathan was the number two person at the San Francisco SPCA.,And what you may not know about the history of the SPCA,is, it was founded to kill dogs and cats.,Cities gave them a charter,to get rid of the stray animals on the street and destroy them.,In a typical year four million dogs and cats were killed,,most of them within 24 hours of being scooped off of the street.,Nathan and his boss saw this,,and they could not tolerate it.,So they set out to make San Francisco,a no-kill city:,create an entire city,where every dog and cat,,unless it was ill or dangerous,,would be adopted, not killed.,And everyone said it was impossible.,Nathan and his boss went to the city council to get a change in the ordinance.,And people from SPCAs and humane shelters around the country,flew to San Francisco,to testify against them --,to say it would hurt the movement and it was inhumane.,They persisted. And Nathan went directly to the community.,He connected with people who cared about this:,nonprofessionals, people with passion.,And within just a couple years,,San Francisco became the first no-kill city,,running no deficit, completely supported by the community.,Nathan left and went to Tompkins County, New York --,a place as different from San Francisco,as you can be and still be in the United States. And he did it again.,He went from being a glorified dogcatcher,to completely transforming the community.,And then he went to North Carolina and did it again.,And he went to Reno and he did it again. 
 And when I think about what Nathan did,,and when I think about what people here do, I think about ideas.,And I think about the idea that,creating an idea, spreading an idea,has a lot behind it.,I don't know if you've ever been to a Jewish wedding,,but what they do is, they take a light bulb,and they smash it.,Now there is a bunch of reasons for that, and stories about it.,But one reason is because it indicates a change,,from before to after.,It is a moment in time.,And I want to argue that we are living through,and are right at the key moment,of a change in the way ideas are created,and spread and implemented. 
 We started with the factory idea:,that you could change the whole world if you had an efficient factory,that could churn out change.,We then went to the TV idea,,that said if you had a big enough mouthpiece,,if you could get on TV enough times, if you could buy enough ads, you could win.,And now we're in this new model of leadership,,where the way we make change,is not by using money,or power to lever a system,,but by leading. 
 So let me tell you about the three cycles. The first one is the factory cycle.,Henry Ford comes up with a really cool idea.,It enables him to hire men,who used to get paid 50 cents a day,and pay them five dollars a day.,Because he's got an efficient enough factory.,Well with that sort of advantage,you can churn out a lot of cars.,You can make a lot of change. You can get roads built.,You can change the fabric of an entire country.,That the essence of what you're doing is you need,ever-cheaper labor,,and ever-faster machines.,And the problem we've run into is, we're running out of both.,Ever-cheaper labor and ever-faster machines.,(Laughter) 
 So we shift gears for a minute,,and say, "I know: television;,advertising. Push push.,Take a good idea and push it on the world.,I have a better mousetrap.,And if I can just get enough money to tell enough people, I'll sell enough.",And you can build an entire industry on that.,If necessary you can put babies in your ads.,If necessary you can use babies to sell other stuff.,And if babies don't work, you can use doctors.,But be careful.,Because you don't want to get an unfortunate juxtaposition,,where you're talking about one thing instead of the other.,(Laughter),This model requires you to act like the king,,like the person in the front of the room,throwing things to the peons in the back.,That you are in charge, and you're going to tell people,what to do next.,The quick little diagram of it is, you're up here,,and you are pushing it out to the world.,This method -- mass marketing --,requires average ideas,,because you're going to the masses,,and plenty of ads.,What we've done as spammers,is tried to hypnotize everyone,into buying our idea,,hypnotize everyone into donating to our cause,,hypnotize everyone into voting for our candidate.,And, unfortunately, it doesn't work so well anymore either.,(Laughter) 
 But there is good news around the corner -- really good news.,I call it the idea of tribes.,What tribes are, is a very simple concept,that goes back 50,000 years.,It's about leading and connecting people and ideas.,And it's something that people have wanted forever.,Lots of people are used to having a spiritual tribe, or a church tribe,,having a work tribe,,having a community tribe.,But now, thanks to the internet, thanks to the explosion of mass media,,thanks to a lot of other things,that are bubbling through our society around the world,,tribes are everywhere. 
 The Internet was supposed to homogenize everyone by connecting us all.,Instead what it's allowed is silos of interest.,So you've got the red-hat ladies over here.,You've got the red-hat triathletes over there.,You've got the organized armies over here.,You've got the disorganized rebels over here.,You've got people in white hats making food.,And people in white hats sailing boats.,The point is that you can find Ukrainian folk dancers,and connect with them,,because you want to be connected.,That people on the fringes,can find each other, connect and go somewhere.,Every town that has a volunteer fire department,understands this way of thinking.,(Laughter) 
 Now it turns out,this is a legitimate non-photoshopped photo.,People I know who are firemen told me that this is not uncommon.,And that what firemen do to train sometimes,is they take a house that is going to be torn down,,and they burn it down instead, and practice putting it out.,But they always stop and take a picture.,(Laughter) 
 You know the pirate tribe is a fascinating one.,They've got their own flag. They've got the eye patches.,You can tell when you're running into someone in a tribe.,And it turns out that it's tribes --,not money, not factories --,that can change our world, that can change politics,,that can align large numbers of people.,Not because you force them to do something against their will,,but because they wanted to connect. 
 That what we do for a living now,,all of us, I think,,is find something worth changing,,and then assemble tribes that assemble tribes,that spread the idea and spread the idea.,And it becomes something far bigger than ourselves,,it becomes a movement.,So when Al Gore set out,to change the world again,,he didn't do it by himself.,And he didn't do it by buying a lot of ads.,He did it by creating a movement.,Thousands of people around the country,who could give his presentation for him,,because he can't be in 100 or 200 or 500 cities in each night. 
 You don't need everyone.,What Kevin Kelley has taught us is you just need,,I don't know, a thousand true fans --,a thousand people who care enough,that they will get you the next round,and the next round and the next round.,And that means that the idea you create, the product you create,,the movement you create isn't for everyone,,it's not a mass thing. That's not what this is about.,What it's about instead,is finding the true believers.,It's easy to look at what I've said so far,,and say, "Wait a minute, I don't have what it takes to be that kind of leader." 
 So here are two leaders. They don't have a lot in common.,They're about the same age. But that's about it.,What they did, though, is each in their own way,,created a different way,of navigating your way through technology.,So some people will go out and get people to be on one team.,And some people will get people to be on the other team. 
 It also informs the decisions you make,when you make products or services.,You know, this is one of my favorite devices.,But what a shame that it's not organized,to help authors create movements.,What would happen if, when you're using your Kindle,,you could see the comments and quotes and notes,from all the other people reading the same book as you in that moment.,Or from your book group. Or from your friends, or from the circle you want.,What would happen if authors, or people with ideas,could use version two, which comes out on Monday,,and use it to organize people,who want to talk about something.,Now there is a million things I could share with you about the mechanics here.,But let me just try a couple. 
 The Beatles did not invent teenagers.,They merely decided to lead them.,That most movements, most leadership that we're doing,is about finding a group that's disconnected,but already has a yearning --,not persuading people to want something,they don't have yet. 
 When Diane Hatz worked on "The Meatrix,",her video that spread all across the internet,about the way farm animals are treated,,she didn't invent the idea of being a vegan.,She didn't invent the idea of caring about this issue.,But she helped organize people,,and helped turn it into a movement. 
 Hugo Chavez did not invent the disaffected,middle and lower class of Venezuela. He merely led them. 
 Bob Marley did not invent Rastafarians.,He just stepped up and said, "Follow me." 
 Derek Sivers invented CD Baby,,which allowed independent musicians,to have a place to sell their music without selling out to the man --,to have place to take the mission,they already wanted to go to, and connect with each other. 
 What all these people have in common is that they are heretics.,That heretics look at the status quo and say,,"This will not stand. I can't abide this status quo.,I am willing to stand up and be counted and move things forward.,I see what the status quo is; I don't like it.",That instead of looking at all the little rules,and following each one of them,,that instead of being what I call a sheepwalker --,somebody who's half asleep,,following instructions,,keeping their head down, fitting in --,every once in a while someone stands up and says, "Not me.",Someone stands up and says, "This one is important.,We need to organize around it.",And not everyone will. But you don't need everyone.,You just need a few people --,(Laughter) --,who will look at the rules,,realize they make no sense,,and realize how much they want to be connected. 
 So Tony Hsieh does not run a shoe store.,Zappos isn't a shoe store.,Zappos is the one, the only,,the best-there-ever-was,place for people who are into shoes to find each other,,to talk about their passion,,to connect with people who care more,about customer service than making a nickel tomorrow.,It can be something as prosaic as shoes,,and something as complicated as overthrowing a government.,It's exactly the same behavior though. 
 What it requires, as Geraldine Carter has discovered,,is to be able to say, "I can't do this by myself.,But if I can get other people to join my Climb and Ride,,then together we can get something that we all want.,We're just waiting for someone to lead us." 
 Michelle Kaufman has pioneered,new ways of thinking about environmental architecture.,She doesn't do it by quietly building one house at a time.,She does it by telling a story,to people who want to hear it.,By connecting a tribe of people,who are desperate to be connected to each other.,By leading a movement and,making change.,And around and around and around it goes. 
 So three questions I'd offer you.,The first one is, who exactly,are you upsetting?,Because if you're not upsetting anyone, you're not changing the status quo.,The second question is, who are you connecting?,Because for a lot of people, that's what they're in it for:,the connections that are being made, one to the other.,And the third one is, who are you leading?,Because focusing on that part of it --,not the mechanics of what you're building,,but the who, and the leading part -- is where change comes. 
 So Blake, at Tom's Shoes, had a very simple idea.,"What would happen if every time someone bought a pair of these shoes,I gave exactly the same pair to someone,who doesn't even own a pair of shoes?",This is not the story of how you get shelf space at Neiman Marcus.,It's a story of a product that tells a story.,And as you walk around with this remarkable pair of shoes,and someone says, "What are those?",You get to tell the story on Blake's behalf,,on behalf of the people who got the shoes.,And suddenly it's not one pair of shoes or 100 pairs of shoes.,It's tens of thousands of pairs of shoes. 
 My friend Red Maxwell has spent the last 10 years,fighting against juvenile diabetes.,Not fighting the organization that's fighting it -- fighting with them, leading them,,connecting them, challenging the status quo,because it's important to him.,And the people he surrounds himself with need the connection.,They need the leadership. It makes a difference. 
 You don't need permission from people to lead them.,But in case you do, here it is:,they're waiting, we're waiting,for you to show us where to go next.,So here is what leaders have in common. The first thing is, they challenge,the status quo.,They challenge what's currently there.,The second thing is, they build a culture.,A secret language, a seven-second handshake,,a way of knowing that you're in or out.,They have curiosity. Curiosity about people in the tribe,,curiosity about outsiders. They're asking questions.,They connect people to one another.,Do you know what people want more than anything?,They want to be missed.,They want to be missed the day they don't show up.,They want to be missed when they're gone.,And tribe leaders can do that.,It's fascinating, because all tribe leaders have charisma,,but you don't need charisma to become a leader.,Being a leader gives you charisma.,If you look and study the leaders who have succeeded,,that's where charisma comes from -- from the leading.,Finally, they commit.,They commit to the cause. They commit to the tribe.,They commit to the people who are there. 
 So I'd like you to do something for me.,And I hope you'll think about it before you reject it out-of-hand.,What I want you to do, it only takes 24 hours,,is: create a movement.,Something that matters. Start. Do it. We need it.,Thank you very much. I appreciate it.,(Applause)I have a big impact on the planet,to travel here by plane.,I emitted, in the atmosphere, nine tons of CO2;,that is the weight of two elephants.,I came here to speak about ecology,,and I emitted as much CO2,as a Frenchman in one year.,So what do I have to do?,I have to kill a Frenchman when I come back at home?,(Laughter),I have to do my carbon offset in another way,,like I do every time.,(Laughter) 
 In fact my work is to show,our impact on our planet.,I'm going to show you some examples,of the last pictures I've done,in the last year. 
 Alberta sand oil, a lot of pollution.,You know the problem;,we don't want to believe what we know.,In Alberta people work nonstop,,24 hours by seven,to extract as much oil,as they can.,We know about the end of oil.,Oil sand is not a long-term solution.,But we use three times more oil,than we find every year.,We don't want to believe what we know.,Deny. 
 Coral reef in New Caledonia.,100 percent of the coral,may be wiped out before 2050,because of global warming.,And you know how coral are very sensitive to temperature,,and are very important for the biodiversity of the sea. 
 North Pole. I've done this picture last summer.,It was impossible to do this picture 15 years ago.,Now there is a new way open between Atlantic and Pacific.,The thickness of the Arctic,decreased more than 40 percent,since 1960. 
 There is a new face of Kilimanjaro without ice.,Sad picture.,It lost 80 percent of its ice.,According to scientists,,in 100 years,all the mountain glacier will be gone.,Glaciers are very important for the life on earth.,Like Al Gore told you,,two billion people live on the water,from the glacier of Himalaya. 
 Return of fish men.,One fifth of human kind,depend on fish to live.,Today now 70 percent,of the fish stock are over-exploited.,According to FAO,,if we don't change our system of fishing,the main sea resources will be gone in 2050.,We don't want to believe what we know. 
 The beautiful picture, by [unclear] in Africa.,One human of six,have not enough to eat in the world.,One billion people have not enough to eat.,In Africa, corn is one of the main foods in many places.,Here in America,,90 percent of the corn cultivated,is used to feed animals or to do oil. 
 Palm tree plantation in Borneo.,Every year we lose 50 thousand square miles in deforestation. 
 Refugee camp in Darfur.,Today we have 20 million refugees in the world.,According to the U.N.,,we speak about 250 million refugees,in 2050. 
 I always show my pictures in the street.,We have done already 100 exhibitions in the cities.,But how to understand the world,without the voice of people?,Landscape was not enough.,It was obvious to me to do another work.,I launched a project named Six Billion Others.,I sent around the world six cameramen,asking the same question,,the same crucial question,,about life.,We have done five thousand interviews.,I'm going to show you this. 
 Man: The most beautiful thing that has happened to me in life?,It's when my dad told me, "Here, I give you this girl as your fiance." 
 Woman: Love? Love is nice if you can have it. 
 Second Man: Romeo and Juliet, Sassi and Panno, Dodi and Diana, Heer and Ranjha,,this is love! Third Man: My greatest fear is ... 
 Woman: You're asking me a hard question. 
 Fourth Man: I live happily because what else should I do? 
 Fifth Man: The first thing I remember ... (Sixth Man: That's how I learned, by my mother,),Fifth Man: ... from my childhood, (Sixth Man: that you should respect humans.),Fifth Man: we were having fun, biking. (Sixth Man: I will never forget those words.) 
 Seventh Man: We invented stories, we flew around the world, while remaining in our attic. 
 Eighth Man: I had a big laugh today.,Ninth Man: You see, family is ... it's awful. 
 10th Man: In the word life, you have the life. 
 11th Man: Who am I? Isn't that the biggest question? 
 12th Man: If I was to go back to Iraq,and speak to the people,,I'd have to bow down and kiss their feet.,Just as that woman tried to kiss my feet,when we were taking her sons.,I feel ashamed.,And I feel humbled,by their strength.,And I will forever feel a need,to make reparations to Iraq. 
 Second Woman: Dad, Mom, I grew up.,You shouldn't worry about me. Dad doesn't need to go to work.,My family ... What can I say?,At the moment, my family is very poor,,my life here in Shenzhen is just about showing myself that I can earn more,and to let my parents stay and have something to live on.,I don't want them to spend their whole lives in poverty.,If someday I can achieve something, I would like to say thank you daddy and mommy.,Thank you.,Thank you for having fed me and raised me,,and for making my life of today. Thank you. 
 13th Man: After seven years now of being in a wheelchair,,I've done more in life being in a chair,than out of a chair.,I still surf. I sail the world. I freedive.,After many people said I couldn't do that.,And I think that comes from connecting with nature,,connecting with the energy of life,,because we're all disabled in some way on the planet --,spiritually, mentally or physically.,I got the easy part. 
 14th Man: Let's say that you and me like each other.,You come from elsewhere.,You don't know me. I don't know you.,We talk without lying.,If I do like you, I give you one cow and many other things,and we become friends.,How can we make it all by ourselves? 
 (Applause) 
 YAB: You can also go to the website,,answer -- respond to the questions also.,Forty crucial questions. 
 Now I am going to speak to you about my movie.,For the last three years,,I was shooting the earth for the movie.,The name of the movie is "Home" --,"Maison.",It is about the state of the planet.,It's a fantastic story of life on the earth.,I'm very proud to show you the teaser. 
 Video: This Earth is four and a half billion years old.,These plants, several hundred million years old.,And we humans have been walking upright,for only 200 thousand years.,We've managed to adapt,,and have conquered the whole planet.,For generations, we've been raising our children,,not unlike millions of other species living beside us.,For the past 30 years,I've been closely watching the earth and its dwellers,from high up in the sky.,Our life is tied to the well-being of our planet.,We depend on water,,forests,,deserts,,oceans.,Fishing,,breeding,,farming,are still the world's foremost human occupations.,And what binds us together,is far greater than what divides us.,We all share the same need for the earth's gifts --,the same wish to rise above ourselves,,and become better.,And yet we carry on raising walls,to keep us apart. 
 Today our greatest battle,is to protect the natural offerings of our planet.,In less than 50 years,we've altered it more thoroughly,than in the entire history of mankind.,Half of the world's forests have vanished.,Water resources are running low.,Intensive farming is depleting soils.,Our energy sources are not sustainable.,The climate is changing.,We are endangering ourselves.,We're only trying to improve our lives.,But the wealth gaps are growing wider.,We haven't yet understood,that we're going at a much faster pace,than the planet can sustain.,We know that solutions are available today.,We all have the power to change this trend,for the better.,So what are we waiting for?,(Applause) 
 YAB: Luc Besson is the producer of the movie.,But it is not a normal movie.,The film is going to be distributed free.,This film has no copyright.,On the five of June,,the environment day,,everybody can download the movie on Internet.,The film is given for free,to the distributor for TV and theater,to show it the fifth of June.,There is no business on this movie.,It is also available for school,,cities, NGOs and you. 
 We have to believe what we know.,Let me tell you something.,It's too late to be pessimistic --,really too late.,We have all a part of the solutions.,To finish,,I would like to welcome,the 4,700th baby,born since the beginning of this talk.,Merci beaucoup. I love you.,(Applause)I was speaking to a group of about 300 kids,,ages six to eight, at a children's museum,,and I brought with me a bag full of legs,,similar to the kinds of things you see up here,,and had them laid out on a table for the kids.,And, from my experience, you know, kids are naturally curious,about what they don't know, or don't understand,,or is foreign to them.,They only learn to be frightened of those differences,when an adult influences them to behave that way,,and maybe censors that natural curiosity,,or you know, reins in the question-asking,in the hopes of them being polite little kids.,So I just pictured a first grade teacher out in the lobby,with these unruly kids, saying, "Now, whatever you do,,don't stare at her legs." 
 But, of course, that's the point.,That's why I was there, I wanted to invite them to look and explore.,So I made a deal with the adults,that the kids could come in without any adults for two minutes,on their own.,The doors open, the kids descend on this table of legs,,and they are poking and prodding, and they're wiggling toes,,and they're trying to put their full weight on the sprinting leg,to see what happens with that.,And I said, "Kids, really quickly --,I woke up this morning, I decided I wanted to be able to jump over a house --,nothing too big, two or three stories --,but, if you could think of any animal, any superhero, any cartoon character,,anything you can dream up right now,,what kind of legs would you build me?" 
 And immediately a voice shouted, "Kangaroo!","No, no, no! Should be a frog!","No. It should be Go Go Gadget!","No, no, no! It should be the Incredibles.",And other things that I don't -- aren't familiar with.,And then, one eight-year-old said,,"Hey, why wouldn't you want to fly too?",And the whole room, including me, was like, "Yeah.",(Laughter),And just like that, I went from being a woman,that these kids would have been trained to see as "disabled",to somebody that had potential that their bodies didn't have yet.,Somebody that might even be super-abled.,Interesting. 
 So some of you actually saw me at TED, 11 years ago.,And there's been a lot of talk about how life-changing this conference is,for both speakers and attendees, and I am no exception.,TED literally was the launch pad to the next decade of my life's exploration.,At the time, the legs I presented were groundbreaking in prosthetics.,I had woven carbon fiber sprinting legs,modeled after the hind leg of a cheetah,,which you may have seen on stage yesterday.,And also these very life-like, intrinsically painted silicone legs. 
 So at the time, it was my opportunity to put a call out,to innovators outside the traditional medical prosthetic community,to come bring their talent to the science and to the art,of building legs.,So that we can stop compartmentalizing form, function and aesthetic,,and assigning them different values.,Well, lucky for me, a lot of people answered that call.,And the journey started, funny enough, with a TED conference attendee --,Chee Pearlman, who hopefully is in the audience somewhere today.,She was the editor then of a magazine called ID,,and she gave me a cover story. 
 This started an incredible journey.,Curious encounters were happening to me at the time;,I'd been accepting numerous invitations to speak,on the design of the cheetah legs around the world.,And people would come up to me after the conference, after my talk,,men and women.,And the conversation would go something like this,,"You know Aimee, you're very attractive.,You don't look disabled.",(Laughter),I thought, "Well, that's amazing,,because I don't feel disabled.",And it really opened my eyes to this conversation,that could be explored, about beauty.,What does a beautiful woman have to look like?,What is a sexy body?,And interestingly, from an identity standpoint,,what does it mean to have a disability?,I mean, people -- Pamela Anderson has more prosthetic in her body than I do.,Nobody calls her disabled.,(Laughter) 
 So this magazine, through the hands of graphic designer Peter Saville,,went to fashion designer Alexander McQueen, and photographer Nick Knight,,who were also interested in exploring that conversation.,So, three months after TED I found myself on a plane,to London, doing my first fashion shoot,,which resulted in this cover --,"Fashion-able"?,Three months after that, I did my first runway show for Alexander McQueen,on a pair of hand-carved wooden legs made from solid ash.,Nobody knew -- everyone thought they were wooden boots.,Actually, I have them on stage with me:,grapevines, magnolias -- truly stunning.,Poetry matters.,Poetry is what elevates the banal and neglected object,to a realm of art.,It can transform the thing that might have made people fearful,into something that invites them to look,,and look a little longer,,and maybe even understand. 
 I learned this firsthand with my next adventure.,The artist Matthew Barney, in his film opus called the "The Cremaster Cycle.",This is where it really hit home for me --,that my legs could be wearable sculpture.,And even at this point, I started to move away from the need to replicate human-ness,as the only aesthetic ideal.,So we made what people lovingly referred to as glass legs,even though they're actually optically clear polyurethane,,a.k.a. bowling ball material.,Heavy!,Then we made these legs that are cast in soil,with a potato root system growing in them, and beetroots out the top,,and a very lovely brass toe.,That's a good close-up of that one.,Then another character was a half-woman, half-cheetah --,a little homage to my life as an athlete.,14 hours of prosthetic make-up,to get into a creature that had articulated paws,,claws and a tail that whipped around,,like a gecko.,(Laughter),And then another pair of legs we collaborated on were these --,look like jellyfish legs,,also polyurethane.,And the only purpose that these legs can serve,,outside the context of the film,,is to provoke the senses and ignite the imagination.,So whimsy matters. 
 Today, I have over a dozen pair of prosthetic legs,that various people have made for me,,and with them I have different negotiations of the terrain under my feet,,and I can change my height --,I have a variable of five different heights.,(Laughter),Today, I'm 6'1".,And I had these legs made a little over a year ago,at Dorset Orthopedic in England,and when I brought them home to Manhattan,,my first night out on the town, I went to a very fancy party.,And a girl was there who has known me for years,at my normal 5'8".,Her mouth dropped open when she saw me,,and she went, "But you're so tall!",And I said, "I know. Isn't it fun?",I mean, it's a little bit like wearing stilts on stilts,,but I have an entirely new relationship to door jams,that I never expected I would ever have.,And I was having fun with it.,And she looked at me,,and she said, "But, Aimee, that's not fair.",(Laughter),(Applause),And the incredible thing was she really meant it.,It's not fair that you can change your height,,as you want it. 
 And that's when I knew --,that's when I knew that the conversation with society,has changed profoundly,in this last decade.,It is no longer a conversation about overcoming deficiency.,It's a conversation about augmentation.,It's a conversation about potential.,A prosthetic limb doesn't represent the need to replace loss anymore.,It can stand as a symbol that the wearer,has the power to create whatever it is that they want to create,in that space.,So people that society once considered to be disabled,can now become the architects of their own identities,and indeed continue to change those identities,by designing their bodies,from a place of empowerment.,And what is exciting to me so much right now,is that by combining cutting-edge technology --,robotics, bionics --,with the age-old poetry,,we are moving closer to understanding our collective humanity.,I think that if we want to discover the full potential,in our humanity,,we need to celebrate those heartbreaking strengths,and those glorious disabilities that we all have.,I think of Shakespeare's Shylock:,"If you prick us, do we not bleed,,and if you tickle us, do we not laugh?",It is our humanity,,and all the potential within it,,that makes us beautiful.,Thank you.,(Applause)Now, if President Obama,invited me to be the next Czar of Mathematics,,then I would have a suggestion for him,that I think would vastly improve,the mathematics education in this country.,And it would be easy to implement,and inexpensive. 
 The mathematics curriculum that we have,is based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra.,And everything we learn after that,is building up towards one subject.,And at top of that pyramid, it's calculus.,And I'm here to say,that I think that that is the wrong summit of the pyramid ...,that the correct summit -- that all of our students,,every high school graduate should know --,should be statistics:,probability and statistics.,(Applause) 
 I mean, don't get me wrong. Calculus is an important subject.,It's one of the great products of the human mind.,The laws of nature are written in the language of calculus.,And every student who studies math, science, engineering, economics,,they should definitely learn calculus,by the end of their freshman year of college.,But I'm here to say, as a professor of mathematics,,that very few people actually use calculus,in a conscious, meaningful way, in their day-to-day lives.,On the other hand,,statistics -- that's a subject that you could,,and should, use on daily basis. Right?,It's risk. It's reward. It's randomness.,It's understanding data. 
 I think if our students, if our high school students --,if all of the American citizens --,knew about probability and statistics,,we wouldn't be in the economic mess that we're in today. (Laughter) (Applause),Not only -- thank you -- not only that ...,but if it's taught properly, it can be a lot of fun.,I mean, probability and statistics,,it's the mathematics of games and gambling.,It's analyzing trends. It's predicting the future.,Look, the world has changed,from analog to digital.,And it's time for our mathematics curriculum to change,from analog to digital,,from the more classical, continuous mathematics,,to the more modern, discrete mathematics --,the mathematics of uncertainty,,of randomness, of data --,that being probability and statistics. 
 In summary, instead of our students,learning about the techniques of calculus,,I think it would be far more significant,if all of them knew what two standard deviations,from the mean means. And I mean it.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)Chris Anderson: And now we go live to Caracas,to see one of Maestro Abreu's great proteges.,He is the new musical director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra.,He's the greatest young conductor in the world.,Gustavo Dudamel!,(Applause),(Music),(Applause),Gustavo Dudamel: Hi everybody in L.A.,Hi Quincy. Hi Maestro Zander. Hi Mark.,We are very happy to have the possibility to be with you,in the other side of the world.,We can speak only with music.,We are very happy,because we have the opportunity,to have this angel in the world --,not only in our country, Venezuela,,but in our world.,He has given us the possibility,to have dreams and to make true the dreams.,And here are the results,of this wonderful project,that is The System in Venezuela.,We hope to have, our Maestro,,to have orchestras in all the countries,in all Americas.,And we want to play a little piece for you,by one of the most important composers,of America.,A Mexican composer: Arturo Marquez.,"Danzon No. 2.",(Music),(Applause)Last year at TED I gave an introduction to the LHC.,And I promised to come back and give you an update,on how that machine worked.,So this is it. And for those of you that weren't there,,the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted --,27 kilometers in circumference.,Its job is to recreate the conditions,that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began,,up to 600 million times a second.,It's nothing if not ambitious. 
 This is the machine below Geneva.,We take the pictures of those mini-Big Bangs inside detectors.,This is the one I work on. It's called the ATLAS detector --,44 meters wide, 22 meters in diameter.,Spectacular picture here of ATLAS under construction,so you can see the scale. 
 On the 10th of September last year we turned the machine on for the first time.,And this picture was taken by ATLAS.,It caused immense celebration in the control room.,It's a picture of the first beam particle,going all the way around the LHC,,colliding with a piece of the LHC deliberately,,and showering particles into the detector.,In other words, when we saw that picture on September 10th,we knew the machine worked,,which is a great triumph.,I don't know whether this got the biggest cheer,,or this, when someone went onto Google,and saw the front page was like that.,It means we made cultural impact,as well as scientific impact. 
 About a week later we had a problem with the machine,,related actually to these bits of wire here -- these gold wires.,Those wires carry 13 thousand amps,when the machine is working in full power.,Now the engineers amongst you will look at them and say,,"No they don't. They're small wires.",They can do that because,when they are very cold they are what's called superconducting wire.,So at minus 271 degrees,,colder than the space between the stars,,those wires can take that current. 
 In one of the joints between over 9,000 magnets in LHC,,there was a manufacturing defect.,So the wire heated up slightly,,and its 13,000 amps suddenly encountered electrical resistance.,This was the result.,Now that's more impressive,when you consider those magnets weigh over 20 tons,,and they moved about a foot.,So we damaged about 50 of the magnets.,We had to take them out, which we did.,We reconditioned them all, fixed them.,They're all on their way back underground now.,By the end of March the LHC will be intact again.,We will switch it on,,and we expect to take data in June or July,,and continue with our quest to find out,what the building blocks of the universe are. 
 Now of course, in a way,those accidents reignite the debate,about the value of science and engineering at the edge. It's easy to refute.,I think that the fact that it's so difficult,,the fact that we're overreaching, is the value of things like the LHC.,I will leave the final word to an English scientist, Humphrey Davy,,who, I suspect,,when defending his protege's useless experiments --,his protege was Michael Faraday --,said this, "Nothing is so dangerous,to the progress of the human mind,than to assume that our views of science are ultimate,,that there are no mysteries in nature,,that our triumphs are complete, and that,there are no new worlds to conquer.",Thank you.,(Applause)Let's talk trash. 
 You know, we had to be taught,to renounce the powerful conservation ethic,we developed during the Great Depression and World War II.,After the war, we needed to direct our enormous production capacity,toward creation of products for peacetime.,Life Magazine helped in this effort,by announcing the introduction of throwaways,that would liberate the housewife from the drudgery of doing dishes. 
 Mental note to the liberators:,throwaway plastics take a lot of space and don't biodegrade.,Only we humans make waste that nature can't digest. 
 Plastics are also hard to recycle.,A teacher told me how to express the under-five-percent,of plastics recovered in our waste stream.,It's diddly-point-squat.,That's the percentage we recycle. 
 Now, melting point has a lot to do with this.,Plastic is not purified by the re-melting process like glass and metal.,It begins to melt below the boiling point of water,and does not drive off the oily contaminants,for which it is a sponge.,Half of each year's 100 billion pounds of thermal plastic pellets,will be made into fast-track trash.,A large, unruly fraction of our trash,will flow downriver to the sea. 
 Here is the accumulation at Biona Creek next to the L.A. airport.,And here is the flotsam near California State University Long Beach,and the diesel plant we visited yesterday. 
 In spite of deposit fees,,much of this trash leading out to the sea will be plastic beverage bottles.,We use two million of them in the United States every five minutes,,here imaged by TED presenter Chris Jordan,,who artfully documents mass consumption and zooms in for more detail. 
 Here is a remote island repository for bottles,off the coast of Baja California.,Isla San Roque is an uninhabited bird rookery,off Baja's sparsely populated central coast.,Notice that the bottles here have caps on them.,Bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate, PET,,will sink in seawater and not make it this far from civilization.,Also, the caps are produced in separate factories,from a different plastic, polypropylene.,They will float in seawater,,but unfortunately do not get recycled under the bottle bills. 
 Let's trace the journey of the millions of caps,that make it to sea solo.,After a year the ones from Japan are heading straight across the Pacific,,while ours get caught in the California current,and first head down to the latitude of Cabo San Lucas.,After ten years, a lot of the Japanese caps,are in what we call the Eastern Garbage Patch,,while ours litter the Philippines.,After 20 years, we see emerging the debris accumulation zone,of the North Pacific Gyre. 
 It so happens that millions of albatross,nesting on Kure and Midway atolls,in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands National Monument,forage here and scavenge whatever they can find,for regurgitation to their chicks.,A four-month old Laysan Albatross chick,died with this in its stomach.,Hundreds of thousands of the goose-sized chicks are dying,with stomachs full of bottle caps and other rubbish,,like cigarette lighters ...,but, mostly bottle caps.,Sadly, their parents mistake bottle caps for food,tossing about in the ocean surface. 
 The retainer rings for the caps,also have consequences for aquatic animals.,This is Mae West,,still alive at a zookeeper's home in New Orleans. 
 I wanted to see what my home town of Long Beach was contributing to the problem,,so on Coastal Clean-Up Day in 2005,I went to the Long Beach Peninsula, at the east end of our long beach.,We cleaned up the swaths of beach shown.,I offered five cents each for bottle caps.,I got plenty of takers.,Here are the 1,100 bottle caps they collected.,I thought I would spend 20 bucks.,That day I ended up spending nearly 60. 
 I separated them by color,and put them on display the next Earth Day,at Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro.,Governor Schwarzenegger and his wife Maria stopped by to discuss the display.,In spite of my "girly man" hat, crocheted from plastic shopping bags,,they shook my hand. (Laughter),I showed him and Maria a zooplankton trawl,from the gyre north of Hawaii,with more plastic than plankton. 
 Here's what our trawl samples from the plastic soup our ocean has become look like.,Trawling a zooplankton net on the surface for a mile,produces samples like this.,And this.,Now, when the debris washes up on the beaches of Hawaii,it looks like this.,And this particular beach is Kailua Beach,,the beach where our president and his family vacationed before moving to Washington. 
 Now, how do we analyze samples like this one,that contain more plastic than plankton?,We sort the plastic fragments into different size classes,,from five millimeters to one-third of a millimeter.,Small bits of plastic concentrate persistent organic pollutants,up to a million times their levels in the surrounding seawater. 
 We wanted to see if the most common fish in the deep ocean,,at the base of the food chain,,was ingesting these poison pills.,We did hundreds of necropsies,,and over a third had polluted plastic fragments in their stomachs.,The record-holder, only two-and-a-half inches long,,had 84 pieces in its tiny stomach. 
 Now, you can buy certified organic produce.,But no fishmonger on Earth,can sell you a certified organic wild-caught fish. 
 This is the legacy we are leaving to future generations.,The throwaway society cannot be contained --,it has gone global.,We simply cannot store and maintain or recycle all our stuff.,We have to throw it away.,Now, the market can do a lot for us,,but it can't fix the natural system in the ocean we've broken.,All the king's horses and all the king's men ...,will never gather up all the plastic and put the ocean back together again. 
 Narrator (Video): The levels are increasing,,the amount of packaging is increasing,,the "throwaway" concept of living is proliferating,,and it's showing up in the ocean. 
 Anchor: He offers no hope of cleaning it up.,Straining the ocean for plastic,would be beyond the budget of any country,and it might kill untold amounts of sea life in the process.,The solution, Moore says, is to stop the plastic at its source:,stop it on land before it falls in the ocean.,And in a plastic-wrapped and packaged world,,he doesn't hold out much hope for that, either.,This is Brian Rooney for Nightline,,in Long Beach, California. 
 Charles Moore: Thank you.I’m going around the world giving talks about Darwin,,and usually what I’m talking about,is Darwin’s strange inversion of reasoning.,Now that title, that phrase, comes from a critic, an early critic,,and this is a passage that I just love, and would like to read for you. 
 "In the theory with which we have to deal, Absolute Ignorance is the artificer;,so that we may enunciate as the fundamental principle of the whole system,,that, in order to make a perfect and beautiful machine,,it is not requisite to know how to make it.,This proposition will be found on careful examination to express,,in condensed form, the essential purport of the Theory,,and to express in a few words all Mr. Darwin’s meaning;,who, by a strange inversion of reasoning,,seems to think Absolute Ignorance fully qualified,to take the place of Absolute Wisdom in the achievements of creative skill." 
 Exactly. Exactly. And it is a strange inversion.,A creationist pamphlet has this wonderful page in it:,"Test Two:,Do you know of any building that didn’t have a builder? Yes/No.,Do you know of any painting that didn’t have a painter? Yes/No.,Do you know of any car that didn’t have a maker? Yes/No.,If you answered 'Yes' for any of the above, give details." 
 A-ha! I mean, it really is a strange inversion of reasoning.,You would have thought it stands to reason,that design requires an intelligent designer.,But Darwin shows that it’s just false. 
 Today, though, I’m going to talk about Darwin’s other strange inversion,,which is equally puzzling at first, but in some ways just as important.,It stands to reason that we love chocolate cake because it is sweet.,Guys go for girls like this because they are sexy.,We adore babies because they’re so cute.,And, of course, we are amused by jokes because they are funny. 
 This is all backwards. It is. And Darwin shows us why.,Let’s start with sweet. Our sweet tooth is basically an evolved sugar detector,,because sugar is high energy, and it’s just been wired up to the preferer,,to put it very crudely, and that’s why we like sugar.,Honey is sweet because we like it, not "we like it because honey is sweet.",There’s nothing intrinsically sweet about honey.,If you looked at glucose molecules till you were blind,,you wouldn’t see why they tasted sweet.,You have to look in our brains to understand why they’re sweet.,So if you think first there was sweetness,,and then we evolved to like sweetness,,you’ve got it backwards; that’s just wrong. It’s the other way round.,Sweetness was born with the wiring which evolved. 
 And there’s nothing intrinsically sexy about these young ladies.,And it’s a good thing that there isn’t, because if there were,,then Mother Nature would have a problem:,How on earth do you get chimps to mate?,Now you might think, ah, there’s a solution: hallucinations.,That would be one way of doing it, but there’s a quicker way.,Just wire the chimps up to love that look,,and apparently they do.,That’s all there is to it.,Over six million years, we and the chimps evolved our different ways.,We became bald-bodied, oddly enough;,for one reason or another, they didn’t.,If we hadn’t, then probably this would be the height of sexiness. 
 Our sweet tooth is an evolved and instinctual preference for high-energy food.,It wasn’t designed for chocolate cake.,Chocolate cake is a supernormal stimulus.,The term is owed to Niko Tinbergen,,who did his famous experiments with gulls,,where he found that that orange spot on the gull’s beak --,if he made a bigger, oranger spot,the gull chicks would peck at it even harder.,It was a hyperstimulus for them, and they loved it.,What we see with, say, chocolate cake,is it’s a supernormal stimulus to tweak our design wiring.,And there are lots of supernormal stimuli; chocolate cake is one.,There's lots of supernormal stimuli for sexiness. 
 And there's even supernormal stimuli for cuteness. Here’s a pretty good example.,It’s important that we love babies, and that we not be put off by, say, messy diapers.,So babies have to attract our affection and our nurturing, and they do.,And, by the way, a recent study shows that mothers,prefer the smell of the dirty diapers of their own baby.,So nature works on many levels here.,But now, if babies didn’t look the way they do -- if babies looked like this,,that’s what we would find adorable, that’s what we would find --,we would think, oh my goodness, do I ever want to hug that.,This is the strange inversion. 
 Well now, finally what about funny. My answer is, it’s the same story, the same story.,This is the hard one, the one that isn’t obvious. That’s why I leave it to the end.,And I won’t be able to say too much about it.,But you have to think evolutionarily, you have to think, what hard job that has to be done --,it’s dirty work, somebody’s got to do it --,is so important to give us such a powerful, inbuilt reward for it when we succeed.,Now, I think we've found the answer -- I and a few of my colleagues.,It’s a neural system that’s wired up to reward the brain,for doing a grubby clerical job.,Our bumper sticker for this view is,that this is the joy of debugging.,Now I’m not going to have time to spell it all out,,but I’ll just say that only some kinds of debugging get the reward.,And what we’re doing is we’re using humor as a sort of neuroscientific probe,by switching humor on and off, by turning the knob on a joke --,now it’s not funny ... oh, now it’s funnier ...,now we’ll turn a little bit more ... now it’s not funny --,in this way, we can actually learn something,about the architecture of the brain,,the functional architecture of the brain. 
 Matthew Hurley is the first author of this. We call it the Hurley Model.,He’s a computer scientist, Reginald Adams a psychologist, and there I am,,and we’re putting this together into a book.,Thank you very much.I am a writer.,Writing books is my professionnbut it's more than that, of course.,It is also my great lifelongnlove and fascination.,And I don't expectnthat that's ever going to change.,But, that said, somethingnkind of peculiar has happened recently,in my life and in my career,,which has caused me to have to recalibratenmy whole relationship with this work.,And the peculiar thingnis that I recently wrote this book,,this memoir called "Eat, Pray, Love",which, decidedlynunlike any of my previous books,,went out in the worldnfor some reason, and became this big,,mega-sensation, internationalnbestseller thing.,The result of whichnis that everywhere I go now,,people treat me like I'm doomed.,Seriously -- doomed, doomed!,Like, they come up to me now,nall worried, and they say,,"Aren't you afraid you're neverngoing to be able to top that?,Aren't you afraid you're goingnto keep writing for your whole life,and you're never againngoing to create a book,that anybody in the worldncares about at all,,ever again?" 
 So that's reassuring, you know.,But it would be worse,nexcept for that I happen to remember,that over 20 years ago,nwhen I was a teenager,,when I first started telling peoplenthat I wanted to be a writer,,I was met with this samensort of fear-based reaction.,And people would say, "Aren't you afraidnyou're never going to have any success?,Aren't you afraid the humiliationnof rejection will kill you?,Aren't you afraid that you're goingnto work your whole life at this craft,and nothing's ever going to come of it,and you're going to dienon a scrap heap of broken dreams,with your mouth fillednwith bitter ash of failure?" 
 (Laughter) 
 Like that, you know. 
 The answer -- the short answernto all those questions is, "Yes.",Yes, I'm afraid of all those things.,And I always have been.,And I'm afraid of many,nmany more things besides,that people can't even guess at,,like seaweed and othernthings that are scary.,But, when it comes to writing,,the thing that I've been sort of thinkingnabout lately, and wondering about lately,,is why?,You know, is it rational?,Is it logical that anybodynshould be expected,to be afraid of the work that they feelnthey were put on this Earth to do.,And what is it specificallynabout creative ventures,that seems to make us really nervousnabout each other's mental health,in a way that other careersnkind of don't do, you know?,Like my dad, for example,nwas a chemical engineer,and I don't recall once in his 40 yearsnof chemical engineering,anybody asking him if he was afraidnto be a chemical engineer, you know?,"That chemical-engineering block,nJohn, how's it going?",It just didn't come upnlike that, you know?,But to be fair,nchemical engineers as a group,haven't really earnedna reputation over the centuries,for being alcoholic manic-depressives. 
 (Laughter) 
 We writers, we kind of do haventhat reputation,,and not just writers,nbut creative people across all genres,,it seems, have this reputationnfor being enormously mentally unstable.,And all you have to do is looknat the very grim death count,in the 20th century alone,nof really magnificent creative minds,who died young and oftennat their own hands, you know?,And even the onesnwho didn't literally commit suicide,seem to be really undonenby their gifts, you know.,Norman Mailer, just before he died,nlast interview, he said,,"Every one of my booksnhas killed me a little more.",An extraordinary statementnto make about your life's work.,But we don't even blinknwhen we hear somebody say this,,because we've heardnthat kind of stuff for so long,and somehow we've completelyninternalized and accepted collectively,this notion that creativity and sufferingnare somehow inherently linked,and that artistry, in the end,nwill always ultimately lead to anguish. 
 And the question that I wantnto ask everybody here today,is are you guys all cool with that idea?,Are you comfortable with that?,Because you look at itneven from an inch away and, you know --,I'm not at all comfortablenwith that assumption.,I think it's odious.,And I also think it's dangerous,,and I don't want to see itnperpetuated into the next century.,I think it's better if we encouragenour great creative minds to live. 
 And I definitely know that,nin my case -- in my situation --,it would be very dangerous for me to startnsort of leaking down that dark path,of assumption,,particularly given the circumstancenthat I'm in right now in my career.,Which is -- you know, like check it out,,I'm pretty young,nI'm only about 40 years old.,I still have maybe another fourndecades of work left in me.,And it's exceedingly likely that anythingnI write from this point forward,is going to be judged by the worldnas the work that came after,the freakish successnof my last book, right?,I should just put it bluntly, becausenwe're all sort of friends here now --,it's exceedingly likelynthat my greatest success is behind me.,So Jesus, what a thought!,That's the kind of thoughtnthat could lead a person,to start drinking ginnat nine o'clock in the morning,,and I don't want to go there. 
 (Laughter) 
 I would prefer to keep doingnthis work that I love. 
 And so, the question becomes, how?,And so, it seems to me,nupon a lot of reflection,,that the way that I have to work now,nin order to continue writing,,is that I have to create some sort ofnprotective psychological construct, right?,I have to sort of find some waynto have a safe distance,between me, as I am writing,nand my very natural anxiety,about what the reaction to that writingnis going to be, from now on.,And, as I've been looking,nover the last year,,for models for how to do that,,I've been sort of looking across time,,and I've been tryingnto find other societies,to see if they might have hadnbetter and saner ideas than we have,about how to help creative people,sort of manage the inherentnemotional risks of creativity. 
 And that search has led mento ancient Greece and ancient Rome.,So stay with me, becausenit does circle around and back.,But, ancient Greece and ancient Rome --,people did not happennto believe that creativity,came from human beings back then, OK?,People believed that creativitynwas this divine attendant spirit,that came to human beingsnfrom some distant and unknowable source,,for distant and unknowable reasons.,The Greeks famously called these divinenattendant spirits of creativity "daemons.",Socrates, famously, believednthat he had a daemon,who spoke wisdom to him from afar. 
 The Romans had the same idea,,but they called that sort of disembodiedncreative spirit a genius.,Which is great, because the Romansndid not actually think,that a genius was a particularlynclever individual.,They believed that a genius was this,nsort of magical divine entity,,who was believed to literallynlive in the walls of an artist's studio,,kind of like Dobby the house elf,,and who would come out,and sort of invisibly assistnthe artist with their work,and would shape the outcome of that work. 
 So brilliant -- there it is, right there,nthat distance that I'm talking about --,that psychological construct to protectnyou from the results of your work.,And everyone knew that thisnis how it functioned, right?,So the ancient artist was protectednfrom certain things,,like, for example,ntoo much narcissism, right?,If your work was brilliant,nyou couldn't take all the credit for it,,everybody knew that you had thisndisembodied genius who had helped you.,If your work bombed,nnot entirely your fault, you know?,Everyone knew your geniusnwas kind of lame. 
 (Laughter) 
 And this is how peoplenthought about creativity in the West,for a really long time.,And then the Renaissance camenand everything changed,,and we had this big idea,nand the big idea was,,let's put the individual human beingnat the center of the universe,above all gods and mysteries,,and there's no more roomnfor mystical creatures,who take dictation from the divine.,And it's the beginningnof rational humanism,,and people startednto believe that creativity,came completely from the selfnof the individual.,And for the first time in history,,you start to hear people referringnto this or that artist as being a genius,,rather than having a genius. 
 And I got to tell you,nI think that was a huge error.,You know, I think that allowingnsomebody, one mere person,to believe that he or she is like,nthe vessel,,you know, like the fontnand the essence and the source,of all divine, creative,nunknowable, eternal mystery,is just a smidge too much responsibilitynto put on one fragile, human psyche.,It's like asking somebodynto swallow the sun.,It just completely warpsnand distorts egos,,and it creates all these unmanageablenexpectations about performance.,And I think the pressure of that,has been killing off our artistsnfor the last 500 years. 
 And, if this is true,,and I think it is true,,the question becomes, what now?,Can we do this differently?,Maybe go back to some morenancient understanding,about the relationship between humansnand the creative mystery.,Maybe not.,Maybe we can't just erase 500 yearsnof rational humanistic thought,in one 18 minute speech.,And there's probablynpeople in this audience,who would raise reallynlegitimate scientific suspicions,about the notion of, basically, fairies,who follow people around rubbing fairynjuice on their projects and stuff.,I'm not, probably, going to bringnyou all along with me on this. 
 But the questionnthat I kind of want to pose is --,you know, why not?,Why not think about it this way?,Because it makes as much sensenas anything else I have ever heard,in terms of explainingnthe utter maddening capriciousness,of the creative process.,A process which, as anybodynwho has ever tried to make something --,which is to say basicallyneveryone here ---,knows does not always behave rationally.,And, in fact, can sometimesnfeel downright paranormal. 
 I had this encounter recently,where I met the extraordinarynAmerican poet Ruth Stone,,who's now in her 90s,nbut she's been a poet her entire life,and she told me that whennshe was growing up in rural Virginia,,she would be out working in the fields,,and she said she would feelnand hear a poem,coming at her from over the landscape.,And she said it was likena thunderous train of air.,And it would come barreling downnat her over the landscape.,And she felt it coming, because itnwould shake the earth under her feet.,She knew that she hadnonly one thing to do at that point,,and that was to,nin her words, "run like hell.",And she would run like hell to the house,and she would be gettingnchased by this poem,,and the whole deal was that she hadnto get to a piece of paper and a pencil,fast enough so that when it thunderednthrough her, she could collect it,and grab it on the page.,And other timesnshe wouldn't be fast enough,,so she'd be running and running,nand she wouldn't get to the house,and the poem would barrelnthrough her and she would miss it,and she said it would continuenon across the landscape,,looking, as she put it "for another poet.",And then there were these times --,this is the piece I never forgot --,she said that there were momentsnwhere she would almost miss it, right?,So, she's running to the housenand she's looking for the paper,and the poem passes through her,,and she grabs a pencil justnas it's going through her,,and then she said, it was likenshe would reach out with her other hand,and she would catch it.,She would catch the poem by its tail,,and she would pull itnbackwards into her body,as she was transcribing on the page.,And in these instances, the poem wouldncome up on the page perfect and intact,but backwards, from the lastnword to the first. 
 (Laughter) 
 So when I heard that I was like --nthat's uncanny,,that's exactly what my creativenprocess is like. 
 (Laughter) 
 That's not at all what my creativenprocess is -- I'm not the pipeline!,I'm a mule, and the waynthat I have to work,is I have to get upnat the same time every day,,and sweat and labor and barrelnthrough it really awkwardly.,But even I, in my mulishness,,even I have brushednup against that thing, at times.,And I would imaginenthat a lot of you have too.,You know, even I have had worknor ideas come through me from a source,that I honestly cannot identify.,And what is that thing?,And how are we to relate to it in a waynthat will not make us lose our minds,,but, in fact, might actually keep us sane? 
 And for me, the best contemporarynexample that I have of how to do that,is the musician Tom Waits,,who I got to interview several years agonon a magazine assignment.,And we were talking about this,,and you know, Tom, for most of his life,nhe was pretty much the embodiment,of the tormentedncontemporary modern artist,,trying to control and manage and dominate,these sort of uncontrollablencreative impulses,that were totally internalized. 
 But then he got older, he got calmer,,and one day he was driving downnthe freeway in Los Angeles,,and this is when it all changed for him.,And he's speeding along,nand all of a sudden,he hears this little fragment of melody,,that comes into his head as inspirationnoften comes, elusive and tantalizing,,and he wants it, it's gorgeous,,and he longs for it,nbut he has no way to get it.,He doesn't have a piece of paper,nor a pencil, or a tape recorder. 
 So he starts to feel all of that oldnanxiety start to rise in him,like, "I'm going to lose this thing,,and I'll be be hauntednby this song forever.,I'm not good enough, and I can't do it.",And instead of panicking, he just stopped.,He just stopped that whole mental processnand he did something completely novel.,He just looked up at the sky, and he said,,"Excuse me, can you notnsee that I'm driving?" 
 (Laughter) 
 "Do I look like I can writendown a song right now?,If you really want to exist,ncome back at a more opportune moment,when I can take care of you.,Otherwise, go bother somebody else today.,Go bother Leonard Cohen." 
 And his whole work processnchanged after that.,Not the work, the work was stillnoftentimes as dark as ever.,But the process, and the heavynanxiety around it,was released when he tooknthe genie, the genius out of him,where it was causing nothing but trouble,nand released it back where it came from,,and realized that this didn't have to benthis internalized, tormented thing.,It could be this peculiar,nwondrous, bizarre collaboration,,kind of conversation betweennTom and the strange, external thing,that was not quite Tom. 
 When I heard that story,nit started to shift a little bit,the way that I worked too,nand this idea already saved me once.,It saved me when I was in the middlenof writing "Eat, Pray, Love,",and I fell into one of thosensort of pits of despair,that we all fall into when we're workingnon something and it's not coming,and you start to think this is going to bena disaster, the worst book ever written.,Not just bad, but the worstnbook ever written.,And I started to think I shouldnjust dump this project.,But then I remembered Tomntalking to the open air,and I tried it.,So I just lifted my facenup from the manuscript,and I directed my commentsnto an empty corner of the room.,And I said aloud, "Listen you, thing,,you and I both knownthat if this book isn't brilliant,that is not entirely my fault, right?,Because you can see that I am puttingneverything I have into this,,I don't have any more than this.,If you want it to be better, you've gotnto show up and do your part of the deal.,But if you don't do that,nyou know what, the hell with it.,I'm going to keep writing anywaynbecause that's my job.,And I would pleasenlike the record to reflect today,that I showed up for my part of the job." 
 (Laughter) 
 Because -- 
 (Applause) 
 Because in the end it's like this, OK --,centuries ago in the desertsnof North Africa,,people used to gather for these moonlightndances of sacred dance and music,that would go on for hoursnand hours, until dawn.,They were always magnificent,nbecause the dancers were professionals,and they were terrific, right?,But every once in a while, very rarely,nsomething would happen,,and one of these performersnwould actually become transcendent.,And I know you knownwhat I'm talking about,,because I know you've all seen,nat some point in your life,,a performance like this.,It was like time would stop,,and the dancer would sort of stepnthrough some kind of portal,and he wasn't doing anything different,than he had ever done,n1,000 nights before,,but everything would align.,And all of a sudden, he wouldnno longer appear to be merely human.,He would be lit from within,nand lit from below,and all lit up on fire with divinity. 
 And when this happened, back then,,people knew it for what it was,nyou know, they called it by its name.,They would put their hands togethernand they would start to chant,,"Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God.",That's God, you know.,Curious historical footnote:,when the Moors invaded southern Spain,nthey took this custom with them,and the pronunciationnchanged over the centuries,from "Allah, Allah, Allah,"nto "Olé, olé, olé,",which you still hear in bullfightsnand in flamenco dances.,In Spain, when a performer has donensomething impossible and magic,,"Allah, olé, olé, Allah,nmagnificent, bravo,",incomprehensible, there it isn-- a glimpse of God.,Which is great, because we need that. 
 But, the tricky bitncomes the next morning,,for the dancer himself,nwhen he wakes up and discovers,that it's Tuesday at 11 a.m.,nand he's no longer a glimpse of God.,He's just an aging mortalnwith really bad knees,,and maybe he's never goingnto ascend to that height again.,And maybe nobody will ever chantnGod's name again as he spins,,and what is he then to donwith the rest of his life?,This is hard.,This is one of the most painfulnreconciliations to make,in a creative life.,But maybe it doesn't have to benquite so full of anguish,if you never happenednto believe, in the first place,,that the most extraordinary aspectsnof your being came from you.,But maybe if you just believednthat they were on loan to you,from some unimaginable sourcenfor some exquisite portion of your life,to be passed along when you're finished,,with somebody else.,And, you know, if we think about itnthis way, it starts to change everything. 
 This is how I've started to think,,and this is certainly how I've beennthinking in the last few months,as I've been working on the booknthat will soon be published,,as the dangerously, frighteninglynover-anticipated follow up,to my freakish success. 
 And what I have tonsort of keep telling myself,when I get really psyched outnabout that is don't be afraid.,Don't be daunted. Just do your job.,Continue to show up for your piece of it,nwhatever that might be.,If your job is to dance, do your dance.,If the divine, cockeyed geniusnassigned to your case,decides to let some sort of wondermentnbe glimpsed, for just one moment,through your efforts, then "Olé!",And if not, do your dance anyhow.,And "Olé!" to you, nonetheless.,I believe this and I feelnthat we must teach it.,"Olé!" to you, nonetheless,,just for having the sheernhuman love and stubbornness,to keep showing up. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you.

 June Cohen: Olé! 
 (Applause)Four years ago, on the TED stage,,I announced a company I was working with at the time,called Odeo.,And because of that announcement,,we got a big article in The New York Times,,which led to more press, which led to more attention,,and me deciding to become CEO of that company --,whereas I was just an adviser --,and raising a round of venture capital,and ramping up hiring. 
 One of the guys I hired was an engineer named Jack Dorsey,,and a year later, when we were trying to decide which way to go with Odeo,,Jack presented an idea he'd been tinkering around with for a number of years,that was based around sending simple status updates to friends.,We were also playing with SMS at the time at Odeo,,so we kind of put two and two together,,and in early 2006 we launched Twitter as a side project at Odeo. 
 Now, it's hard to justify doing a side project,at a startup, where focus is so critical,,but I had actually launched Blogger as a side project,to my previous company,,thinking it was just a little thing we'd do on the side,,and it ended up taking over not only the company,,but my life for the next five or six years.,So I learned to follow hunches,even though you can't necessarily justify them,or know where they're going to go.,And that's kind of what's happened with Twitter, time after time. 
 So, for those of you unfamiliar,,Twitter is based around a very simple, seemingly trivial concept.,You say what you're doing in 140 characters or less,,and people who are interested in you get those updates.,If they're really interested,,they get the update as a text message on their cell phone.,So, for instance, I may Twitter right now,that I'm giving a talk at TED.,And in my case, when I hit send,,up to 60,000 people will receive that message in a matter of seconds.,Now, the fundamental idea is that Twitter,lets people share moments of their lives,whenever they want,,be they momentous occasions,or mundane ones.,It is by sharing these moments as they're happening,that lets people feel more connected and in touch,,despite distance, and in real time.,This is the primary use we saw of Twitter from the beginning,,and what got us excited. 
 What we didn't anticipate was the many, many other uses,that would evolve from this very simple system.,One of the things we realized,was how important Twitter could be during real-time events.,When the wildfires broke out in San Diego,,in October of 2007,,people turned to Twitter to report what was happening,and to find information from neighbors,about what was happening around them. 
 But it wasn't just individuals.,The L.A. Times actually turned to Twitter to dispense information as well,,and put a Twitter feed on the front page,,and the L.A. Fire Department and Red Cross,used it to dispense news and updates as well.,At this event, dozens of people here are Twittering,and thousands of people around the world are following along,because they want to know what it feels like to be here,and what's happening. 
 Among the other interesting things that have cropped up 
 are many things from businesses, 
 from marketing and communications and predictable things,,to an insanely popular Korean-barbecue taco truck,that drives around L.A. and Twitters where it stops,,causing a line to form around the block. 
 Politicians have recently begun Twittering.,In fact, there are 47 members of Congress,who currently have Twitter accounts.,And they're tweeting, in some cases,,from behind closed-door sessions with the President.,In this case, this guy's not liking what he's hearing.,The President himself is our most popular Twitter user,,although his tweets have dropped off as of late,,while Senator McCain's have picked up.,As have this guy's. 
 Twitter was originally designed as a broadcast medium:,you send one message and it goes out to everybody,,and you receive the messages you're interested in.,One of the many ways that users shaped the evolution of Twitter,was by inventing a way to reply to a specific person,or a specific message.,So, this syntax, the "@username" that Shaquille O'Neal's using here,to reply to one of his fans,,was completely invented by users,,and we didn't build it into the system until it already became popular,and then we made it easier.,This is one of the many ways that users have shaped the system. 
 Another is via the API.,We built an application-programming interface,,which basically means that programmers can write software that interacts with Twitter.,We currently know about over 2,000 pieces of software,that can send Twitter updates --,interfaces for Mac, Windows, your iPhone, your BlackBerry --,as well as things like,a device that lets an unborn baby Twitter when it kicks,or a plant Twitter when it needs water. 
 Probably the most important third-party development,came from a little company in Virginia called Summize.,Summize built a Twitter search engine.,And they tapped into the fact,that, if you have millions of people around the world,talking about what they're doing and what's around them,,you have an incredible resource to find out about any topic or event,while it's going on.,This really changed how we perceived Twitter.,For instance, here's what people are saying about TED.,This is another way that our mind was shifted,,and Twitter wasn't what we thought it was.,We liked this so much we actually bought the company,and are folding it into the main product.,This not only lets you view Twitters in different ways,,but it introduces new use cases as well.,One of my favorites is what happened a few months ago,when there was a gas shortage in Atlanta.,Some users figured out,that they would Twitter when they found gas --,where it was, and how much it cost --,and then appended the keyword "#atlgas",which let other people search for that and find gas themselves. 
 And this trend of people using this communication network,to help each other out,goes far beyond the original idea of just keeping up with family and friends.,It's happened more and more lately,,whether it's raising money for homeless people,or to dig wells in Africa,or for a family in crisis.,People have raised tens of thousands of dollars over Twitter,in a matter of days on several occasions.,It seems like when you give people easier ways to share information,,more good things happen. 
 I have no idea what will happen next with Twitter.,I've learned to follow the hunch,,but never assume where it will go.,Thanks. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: We're not quite done yet.,So, look, if we could have this screen live.,This is actually the most terrifying thing that any speaker can do,after they've been to an event.,It's totally intimidating. 
 So, this would be the Twitter search screen.,So we're going to just type a couple of random words into Twitter.,For example: "Evan Williams.","Evan Williams, give people more good ways to share information and follow your hunch at TED.","Currently listening to Evan Williams." "Currently listening to Evan Williams." "Evan Williams --",Oh.,"Evan Williams is just dying on stage here at TED.,Worst talk ever!" (Laughter) 
 Evan Williams: Nice. Thanks. 
 CA: Just kidding. 
 But, literally in the eight minutes he was talking,,there are about fifty tweets that already came on the talk.,So he'll see every aspect of the reaction:,the fact that Barack Obama is the biggest Twitterer,,the fact that it came out of TED.,I don't think there's any other way of getting instant feedback that way. 
 You have build something very fascinating,,and it looks like its best times are still ahead of it.,So, thank you very much, Evan. EW: Thank you.,CA: That was very interesting.Newspapers are dying for a few reasons.,Readers don't want to pay for yesterday's news, and advertisers follow them.,Your iPhone, your laptop,,is much more handy than New York Times on Sunday.,And we should save trees in the end.,So it's enough to bury any industry.,So, should we rather ask, "Can anything save newspapers?" 
 There are several scenarios for the future newspaper.,Some people say it should be free;,it should be tabloid, or even smaller: A4;,it should be local, run by communities,,or niche, for some smaller groups like business --,but then it's not free; it's very expensive.,It should be opinion-driven;,less news, more views.,And we'd rather read it during breakfast,,because later we listen to radio in a car,,check your mail at work and in the evening you watch TV.,Sounds nice, but this can only buy time.,Because in the long run,,I think there is no reason, no practical reason,for newspapers to survive. 
 So what can we do?,(Laughter),Let me tell you my story.,20 years ago, Bonnier, Swedish publisher,,started to set newspapers in the former Soviet Bloc.,After a few years, they had several newspapers in central and eastern Europe.,They were run by an inexperienced staff,,with no visual culture, no budgets for visuals --,in many places there were not even art directors.,I decided to be -- to work for them as an art director.,Before, I was an architect, and my grandmother asked me once,,"What are you doing for a living?",I said, "I'm designing newspapers.","What? There's nothing to design there. It's just boring letters",(Laughter),And she was right. I was very frustrated, until one day. 
 I came to London, and I've seen performance by Cirque du Soleil.,And I had a revelation. I thought,,"These guys took some creepy,,run-down entertainment,,and put it to the highest possible level of performance art.",I thought "Oh my God, maybe I can do the same with these boring newspapers.",And I did. We started to redesign them, one by one.,The front page became our signature.,It was my personal intimate channel to talk to the readers. 
 I'm not going to tell you stories about teamwork or cooperation.,My approach was very egotistic.,I wanted my artistic statement,,my interpretation of reality.,I wanted to make posters, not newspapers.,Not even magazines: posters.,We were experimenting with type,,with illustration, with photos. And we had fun.,Soon it started to bring results.,In Poland, our pages were named,"Covers of the Year" three times in a row.,Other examples you can see here are from,Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia --,the central European countries. 
 But it's not only about the front page.,The secret is that we were treating,the whole newspaper as one piece,,as one composition -- like music.,And music has a rhythm, has ups and downs.,And design is responsible for this experience.,Flipping through pages is readers experience,,and I'm responsible for this experience.,We treated two pages, both spreads, as a one page,,because that's how readers perceive it. 
 You can see some Russian pages here which got many awards,on biggest infographic competition in Spain.,But the real award came from Society for Newspaper Design.,Just a year after redesigning this newspaper in Poland,,they name it the World's Best-Designed Newspaper.,And two years later,,the same award came to Estonia.,Isn't amazing? 
 What really makes it amazing: that the circulation of these newspapers,were growing too.,Just some examples:,in Russia, plus 11 after one year,,plus 29 after three years of the redesign.,Same in Poland: plus 13, up to 35 percent,raise of circulation after three years.,You can see on a graph,,after years of stagnation, the paper started to grow,,just after redesign.,But the real hit was in Bulgaria.,And that is really amazing. 
 Did design do this?,Design was just a part of the process.,And the process we made was not about changing the look,,it was about improving the product completely.,I took an architectural rule about function and form,and translated it into newspaper content and design.,And I put strategy at the top of it.,So first you ask a big question: why we do it? What is the goal?,Then we adjust the content accordingly.,And then, usually after two months, we start designing.,My bosses, in the beginning, were very surprised.,Why am I asking all of these business questions,,instead of just showing them pages?,But soon they realized that this is the new role of designer:,to be in this process from the very beginning to the very end. 
 So what is the lesson behind it?,The first lesson is about that design can change not just your product.,It can change your workflow -- actually, it can change everything in your company;,it can turn your company upside down.,It can even change you.,And who's responsible? Designers.,Give power to designers.,(Applause),But the second is even more important.,You can live in a small poor country, like me.,You can work for a small company,,in a boring branch.,You can have no budgets, no people --,but still can put your work to the highest possible level.,And everybody can do it.,You just need inspiration, vision and determination.,And you need to remember that to be good,is not enough. 
 Thank you.Let's talk about manias.,Let's start with Beatlemania. 
 (Recording of crowd roaring) 
 Hysterical teenagers,,crying, screaming, pandemonium. 
 (Recording of crowd roaring) 
 Sports mania:,deafening crowds,,all for one idea --nget the ball in the net.,(Recording) Goal!,Okay, religious mania:,there's rapture, there's weeping,,there's visions.,Manias can be good.,Manias can be alarming.,Or manias can be deadly. 
 (Recording of crowd cheering) 
 The world has a new mania.,A mania for learning English.,Listen as Chinese studentsnpractice their English,,by screaming it: 
 Teacher: ... change my life! 
 Students: I want to change my life! 
 T: I don't want to let my parents down! 
 S: I don't want to let my parents down! 
 T: I don't ever wantnto let my country down! 
 S: I don't ever wantnto let my country down! 
 T: Most importantly...nS: Most importantly... 
 T: I don't want to let myself down! 
 S: I don't want to let myself down! 
 How many peoplenare trying to learn English worldwide?,Two billion of them. 
 Students: A t-shirt. A dress. 
 Jay Walker: In Latin America,,in India,,in Southeast Asia,,and most of all, in China.,If you're a Chinese student,,you start learning Englishnin the third grade, by law.,That's why this year,,China will become the world's largestnEnglish-speaking country. 
 (Laughter) 
 Why English?,In a single word: opportunity.,Opportunity for a better life, a job,,to be able to pay for school,nor put better food on the table.,Imagine a student takingna giant test for three full days.,Her score on this one testnliterally determines her future.,She studies 12 hours a day,for three years to prepare.,Twenty-five percent of her gradenis based on English.,It's called the gaokao, and 80 millionnhigh school Chinese students,have already taken this grueling test.,The intensity to learn English,is almost unimaginable,nunless you witness it. 
 Teacher: Perfect!nStudents: Perfect! 
 T: Perfect!nS: Perfect! 
 T: I want to speak perfect English! 
 S: I want to speak perfect English! 
 T: I want to speak ...nS: I want to speak ... 
 T: ... perfect English!nS: ... perfect English! 
 T (yelling more loudly):nI want to change my life! 
 S (yelling more loudly):nI want to change my life! 
 JW: So is English mania good or bad?,Is English a tsunami,nwashing away other languages?,Not likely.,English is the world's second language.,Your native language is your life.,But with English you can becomenpart of a wider conversation --,a global conversationnabout global problems,,like climate change or poverty,,or hunger or disease.,The world has other universal languages.,Mathematics is the language of science.,Music is the language of emotions.,And now English is becomingnthe language of problem-solving.,Not because America is pushing it,,but because the world is pulling it.,So English mania is a turning point. 
 Like the harnessingnof electricity in our cities,,or the fall of the Berlin Wall,,English represents hope,for a better future --,a future where the worldnhas a common language,to solve its common problems. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)So, my question:,are we alone? 
 The story of humans is the story of ideas --,scientific ideas that shine light into dark corners,,ideas that we embrace rationally and irrationally,,ideas for which we've lived and died and killed and been killed,,ideas that have vanished in history,,and ideas that have been set in dogma.,It's a story of nations,,of ideologies,,of territories,,and of conflicts among them.,But, every moment of human history,,from the Stone Age to the Information Age,,from Sumer and Babylon to the iPod and celebrity gossip,,they've all been carried out --,every book that you've read,,every poem, every laugh, every tear --,they've all happened here.,Here.,Here.,Here.,(Laughter) 
 Perspective is a very powerful thing.,Perspectives can change.,Perspectives can be altered.,From my perspective, we live on a fragile island of life,,in a universe of possibilities.,For many millennia, humans have been on a journey to find answers,,answers to questions about naturalism and transcendence,,about who we are and why we are,,and of course, who else might be out there.,Is it really just us?,Are we alone in this vast universe,of energy and matter and chemistry and physics?,Well, if we are, it's an awful waste of space.,(Laughter),But, what if we're not? 
 What if, out there, others are asking and answering similar questions?,What if they look up at the night sky, at the same stars,,but from the opposite side?,Would the discovery of an older cultural civilization out there,inspire us to find ways to survive,our increasingly uncertain technological adolescence?,Might it be the discovery of a distant civilization,and our common cosmic origins,that finally drives home the message of the bond among all humans?,Whether we're born in San Francisco, or Sudan,,or close to the heart of the Milky Way galaxy,,we are the products of a billion-year lineage of wandering stardust.,We, all of us,,are what happens when a primordial mixture of hydrogen and helium,evolves for so long that it begins to ask where it came from.,Fifty years ago,,the journey to find answers took a different path,and SETI, the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence,,began. 
 So, what exactly is SETI?,Well, SETI uses the tools of astronomy,to try and find evidence of someone else's technology out there.,Our own technologies are visible over interstellar distances,,and theirs might be as well.,It might be that some massive network of communications,,or some shield against asteroidal impact,,or some huge astro-engineering project that we can't even begin to conceive of,,could generate signals at radio or optical frequencies,that a determined program of searching might detect.,For millennia, we've actually turned to the priests and the philosophers,for guidance and instruction on this question of whether there's intelligent life out there.,Now, we can use the tools of the 21st century to try and observe what is,,rather than ask what should be, believed. 
 SETI doesn't presume the existence of extra terrestrial intelligence;,it merely notes the possibility, if not the probability,in this vast universe, which seems fairly uniform.,The numbers suggest a universe of possibilities.,Our sun is one of 400 billion stars in our galaxy,,and we know that many other stars have planetary systems.,We've discovered over 350 in the last 14 years,,including the small planet, announced earlier this week,,which has a radius just twice the size of the Earth.,And, if even all of the planetary systems in our galaxy were devoid of life,,there are still 100 billion other galaxies out there,,altogether 10^22 stars.,Now, I'm going to try a trick, and recreate an experiment from this morning.,Remember, one billion?,But, this time not one billion dollars, one billion stars.,Alright, one billion stars.,Now, up there, 20 feet above the stage,,that's 10 trillion.,Well, what about 10^22?,Where's the line that marks that?,That line would have to be 3.8 million miles above this stage.,(Laughter),16 times farther away than the moon,,or four percent of the distance to the sun. 
 So, there are many possibilities.,(Laughter),And much of this vast universe,,much more may be habitable than we once thought,,as we study extremophiles on Earth --,organisms that can live in conditions totally inhospitable for us,,in the hot, high pressure thermal vents at the bottom of the ocean,,frozen in ice, in boiling battery acid,,in the cooling waters of nuclear reactors.,These extremophiles tell us that life may exist in many other environments. 
 But those environments are going to be widely spaced in this universe.,Even our nearest star, the Sun --,its emissions suffer the tyranny of light speed.,It takes a full eight minutes for its radiation to reach us.,And the nearest star is 4.2 light years away,,which means its light takes 4.2 years to get here.,And the edge of our galaxy is 75,000 light years away,,and the nearest galaxy to us, 2.5 million light years.,That means any signal we detect would have started its journey a long time ago.,And a signal would give us a glimpse of their past,,not their present.,Which is why Phil Morrison calls SETI, "the archaeology of the future.",It tells us about their past,,but detection of a signal tells us it's possible for us to have a long future. 
 I think this is what David Deutsch meant in 2005,,when he ended his Oxford TEDTalk,by saying he had two principles he'd like to share for living,,and he would like to carve them on stone tablets.,The first is that problems are inevitable.,The second is that problems are soluble.,So, ultimately what's going to determine the success or failure of SETI,is the longevity of technologies,,and the mean distance between technologies in the cosmos --,distance over space and distance over time.,If technologies don't last and persist,,we will not succeed.,And we're a very young technology,in an old galaxy,,and we don't yet know whether it's possible for technologies to persist. 
 So, up until now I've been talking to you about really large numbers.,Let me talk about a relatively small number.,And that's the length of time that the Earth was lifeless.,Zircons that are mined in the Jack Hills of western Australia,,zircons taken from the Jack Hills of western Australia,tell us that within a few hundred million years of the origin of the planet,there was abundant water and perhaps even life.,So, our planet has spent the vast majority of its 4.56 billion year history,developing life,,not anticipating its emergence.,Life happened very quickly,,and that bodes well for the potential of life elsewhere in the cosmos. 
 And the other thing that one should take away from this chart,is the very narrow range of time,over which humans can claim to be the dominant intelligence on the planet.,It's only the last few hundred thousand years,modern humans have been pursuing technology and civilization.,So, one needs a very deep appreciation,of the diversity and incredible scale of life on this planet,as the first step in preparing to make contact with life elsewhere in the cosmos. 
 We are not the pinnacle of evolution.,We are not the determined product,of billions of years of evolutionary plotting and planning.,We are one outcome of a continuing adaptational process.,We are residents of one small planet,in a corner of the Milky Way galaxy.,And Homo sapiens are one small leaf,on a very extensive Tree of Life,,which is densely populated by organisms that have been honed for survival,over millions of years.,We misuse language,,and talk about the "ascent" of man.,We understand the scientific basis for the interrelatedness of life,but our ego hasn't caught up yet.,So this "ascent" of man, pinnacle of evolution,,has got to go.,It's a sense of privilege that the natural universe doesn't share. 
 Loren Eiseley has said,,"One does not meet oneself,until one catches the reflection from an eye other than human.",One day that eye may be that of an intelligent alien,,and the sooner we eschew our narrow view of evolution,the sooner we can truly explore our ultimate origins and destinations. 
 We are a small part of the story of cosmic evolution,,and we are going to be responsible for our continued participation in that story,,and perhaps SETI will help as well.,Occasionally, throughout history, this concept,of this very large cosmic perspective comes to the surface,,and as a result we see transformative and profound discoveries.,So in 1543, Nicholas Copernicus published "The Revolutions of Heavenly Spheres,",and by taking the Earth out of the center,,and putting the sun in the center of the solar system,,he opened our eyes to a much larger universe,,of which we are just a small part.,And that Copernican revolution continues today,to influence science and philosophy and technology and theology. 
 So, in 1959, Giuseppe Coccone and Philip Morrison,published the first SETI article in a refereed journal,,and brought SETI into the scientific mainstream.,And in 1960, Frank Drake conducted the first SETI observation,looking at two stars, Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani,,for about 150 hours.,Now Drake did not discover extraterrestrial intelligence,,but he learned a very valuable lesson from a passing aircraft,,and that's that terrestrial technology can interfere,with the search for extraterrestrial technology. 
 We've been searching ever since,,but it's impossible to overstate the magnitude of the search that remains.,All of the concerted SETI efforts, over the last 40-some years,,are equivalent to scooping a single glass of water from the oceans.,And no one would decide that the ocean was without fish,on the basis of one glass of water.,The 21st century now allows us to build bigger glasses --,much bigger glasses.,In Northern California, we're beginning to take observations,with the first 42 telescopes of the Allen Telescope Array --,and I've got to take a moment right now to publicly thank,Paul Allen and Nathan Myhrvold,and all the TeamSETI members in the TED community,who have so generously supported this research.,(Applause) 
 The ATA is the first telescope built from a large number of small dishes,,and hooked together with computers.,It's making silicon as important as aluminum,,and we'll grow it in the future by adding more antennas to reach 350,for more sensitivity and leveraging Moore's law for more processing capability.,Today, our signal detection algorithms,can find very simple artifacts and noise.,If you look very hard here you can see the signal from the Voyager 1 spacecraft,,the most distant human object in the universe,,106 times as far away from us as the sun is.,And over those long distances, its signal is very faint when it reaches us.,It may be hard for your eye to see it,,but it's easily found with our efficient algorithms.,But this is a simple signal,,and tomorrow we want to be able to find more complex signals. 
 This is a very good year.,2009 is the 400th anniversary of Galileo's first use of the telescope,,Darwin's 200th birthday,,the 150th anniversary of the publication of "On the Origin of Species,",the 50th anniversary of SETI as a science,,the 25th anniversary of the incorporation of the SETI Institute as a non-profit,,and of course, the 25th anniversary of TED.,And next month, the Kepler Spacecraft will launch,and will begin to tell us just how frequent Earth-like planets are,,the targets for SETI's searches.,In 2009, the U.N. has declared it to be the International Year of Astronomy,,a global festival to help us residents of Earth,rediscover our cosmic origins and our place in the universe.,And in 2009, change has come to Washington,,with a promise to put science in its rightful position.,(Applause) 
 So, what would change everything?,Well, this is the question the Edge foundation asked this year,,and four of the respondents said, "SETI.",Why?,Well, to quote:,"The discovery of intelligent life beyond Earth,would eradicate the loneliness and solipsism,that has plagued our species since its inception.,And it wouldn't simply change everything,,it would change everything all at once.",So, if that's right, why did we only capture four out of those 151 minds?,I think it's a problem of completion and delivery,,because the fine print said,,"What game-changing ideas and scientific developments,would you expect to live to see?",So, we have a fulfillment problem.,We need bigger glasses and more hands in the water,,and then working together, maybe we can all live to see,the detection of the first extraterrestrial signal. 
 That brings me to my wish.,I wish that you would empower Earthlings everywhere,to become active participants,in the ultimate search for cosmic company. 
 The first step would be to tap into the global brain trust,,to build an environment where raw data could be stored,,and where it could be accessed and manipulated,,where new algorithms could be developed and old algorithms made more efficient.,And this is a technically creative challenge,,and it would change the perspective of people who worked on it.,And then, we'd like to augment the automated search with human insight.,We'd like to use the pattern recognition capability of the human eye,to find faint, complex signals that our current algorithms miss. 
 And, of course, we'd like to inspire and engage the next generation.,We'd like to take the materials that we have built for education,,and get them out to students everywhere,,students that can't come and visit us at the ATA.,We'd like to tell our story better,,and engage young people, and thereby change their perspective. 
 I'm sorry Seth Godin, but over the millennia, we've seen where tribalism leads.,We've seen what happens when we divide an already small planet,into smaller islands.,And, ultimately, we actually all belong to only one tribe,,to Earthlings.,And SETI is a mirror --,a mirror that can show us ourselves,from an extraordinary perspective,,and can help to trivialize the differences among us.,If SETI does nothing but change the perspective of humans on this planet,,then it will be one of the most profound endeavors in history. 
 So, in the opening days of 2009,,a visionary president stood on the steps of the U.S. Capitol,and said, "We cannot help but believe,that the old hatreds shall someday pass,,that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve,,that, as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself.",So, I look forward to working with the TED community,to hear about your ideas about how to fulfill this wish,,and in collaborating with you,,hasten the day that that visionary statement can become a reality. 
 Thank you.,(Applause)I'm a neuroscientist, a professor at the University of California.,And over the past 35 years,,I've studied behavior,on the basis of everything from genes,through neurotransmitters, dopamine, things like that,,all the way through circuit analysis.,So that's what I normally do.,But then, for some reason,,I got into something else, just recently.,And it all grew out of one of my colleagues asking me,to analyze a bunch of brains,of psychopathic killers. 
 And so this would be the typical talk I would give.,And the question is, "How do you end up with a psychopathic killer?",What I mean by psychopathic killer,are these people, these types of people.,And so some of the brains that I've studied,are people you know about.,When I get the brains I don't know what I'm looking at.,It's blind experiments. They also gave me normal people and everything. 
 So I've looked at about 70 of these.,And what came up was a number of pieces of data.,So we look at these sorts of things theoretically,,on the basis of genetics,,and brain damage, and interaction with environment,,and exactly how that machine works.,So we're interested in exactly where in the brain,,and what's the most important part of the brain.,So we've been looking at this:,the interaction of genes,,what's called epigenetic effects,,brain damage, and environment,,and how these are tied together.,And how you end up with a psychopath, and a killer,,depends on exactly when the damage occurs.,It's really a very precisely timed thing.,You get different kinds of psychopaths. 
 So we're going along with this. And here's, just to give you the pattern.,The pattern is that those people, every one of them I looked at,,who was a murderer, and was a serial killer,,had damage to their orbital cortex,,which is right above the eyes, the orbits,,and also the interior part of the temporal lobe.,So there is the pattern that every one of them had,,but they all were a little different too.,They had other sorts of brain damage.,A key thing is that,the major violence genes,,it's called the MAO-A gene. 
 And there is a variant of this gene that is in the normal population.,Some of you have this. And it's sex-linked.,It's on the X chromosome. And so in this way,you can only get it from your mother.,And in fact this is probably why mostly men, boys,,are psychopathic killers,,or are very aggressive.,Because a daughter can get one X from the father,,one X from the mother, it's kind of diluted out.,But for a son, he can only get,the X chromosome from his mother. 
 So this is how it's passed from mother to son.,And it has to do with too much brain serotonin during development,,which is kind of interesting because serotonin,is supposed to make you calm and relaxed.,But if you have this gene, in utero,your brain is bathed in this,,so your whole brain becomes insensitive to serotonin,,so it doesn't work later on in life. 
 And I'd given this one talk in Israel,,just this past year.,And it does have some consequences.,Theoretically what this means,is that in order to express this gene,,in a violent way,,very early on, before puberty,,you have to be involved in something that is really traumatic --,not a little stress, not being spanked or something,,but really seeing violence,,or being involved in it, in 3D.,Right? That's how the mirror neuron system works. 
 And so, if you have that gene,,and you see a lot of violence,in a certain situation,,this is the recipe for disaster, absolute disaster.,And what I think might happen in these areas of the world,,where we have constant violence,,you end up having generations of kids,that are seeing all this violence.,And if I was a young girl, somewhere in a violent area,,you know, a 14 year old, and I want to find a mate,,I'd find some tough guy, right, to protect me.,Well what the problem is this tends to concentrate these genes.,And now the boys and the girls get them.,So I think after several generations,,and here is the idea, we really have a tinderbox. 
 So that was the idea.,But then my mother said to me, "I hear you've been going around talking,about psychopathic killers.,And you're talking as if you come from a normal family.",I said, "What the hell are you talking about?",She then told me about our own family tree.,Now she blamed this on my father's side, of course.,This was one of these cases, because she has no violence in her background,,but my father did. 
 Well she said, "There is good news and bad news.,One of your cousins is Ezra Cornell, founder of Cornell university.,But the bad news is that your cousin is also Lizzie Borden. 
 Now I said, "Okay, so what? We have Lizzie." 
 She goes, "No it gets worse, read this book." 
 And here is this "Killed Strangely," and it's this historical book.,And the first murder,of a mother by a son,was my great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather.,Okay, so that's the first case of matricide.,And that book is very interesting. Because it's about witch trials,,and how people thought back then. 
 But it doesn't stop there.,There were seven more men, on my father's side,,starting then, Cornells, that were all murderers.,Okay, now this gives one a little pause.,(Laughter),Because my father himself,,and my three uncles, in World War II,,were all conscientious objectors, all pussycats.,But every once in a while, like Lizzie Borden, like three times a century,,and we're kind of due.,(Laughter) 
 So the moral of the story is:,people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.,But more likely is this.,(Laughter),And we had to take action. Now our kids found out about it.,And they all seemed to be OK.,But our grandkids are going to be kind of concerned here.,So what we've done is I've started to do PET scans,of everybody in the family.,(Laughter),We started to do PET scans, EEGs and genetic analysis,to see where the bad news is.,Now the only person -- it turns out,one son and one daughter, siblings,,didn't get along and their patterns are exactly the same.,They have the same brain, and the same EEG.,And now they are close as can be.,But there's gonna be bad news somewhere.,And we don't know where it's going to pop up.,So that's my talk.,(Laughter)I'm here because I have a very important message:,I think we have found,the most important factor for success.,And it was found close to here, Stanford.,Psychology professor took kids that were four years old,and put them in a room all by themselves.,And he would tell the child, a four-year-old kid,,"Johnny, I am going to leave you here with a marshmallow,for 15 minutes.,If, after I come back, this marshmallow is here,,you will get another one. So you will have two.",To tell a four-year-old kid to wait 15 minutes,for something that they like,,is equivalent to telling us, "We'll bring you coffee in two hours.",(Laughter),Exact equivalent. 
 So what happened when the professor left the room?,As soon as the door closed...,two out of three ate the marshmallow.,Five seconds, 10 seconds, 40 seconds, 50 seconds,,two minutes, four minutes, eight minutes.,Some lasted 14-and-a-half minutes.,(Laughter),Couldn't do it. Could not wait.,What's interesting is that one out of three,would look at the marshmallow and go like this ...,Would look at it.,Put it back.,They would walk around. They would play with their skirts and pants. 
 That child already, at four, understood,the most important principle for success,,which is the ability to delay gratification.,Self-discipline:,the most important factor for success.,15 years later, 14 or 15 years later,,follow-up study.,What did they find?,They went to look for these kids who were now 18 and 19.,And they found that 100 percent,of the children that had not eaten the marshmallow were successful.,They had good grades. They were doing wonderful.,They were happy. They had their plans.,They had good relationships with the teachers, students.,They were doing fine. 
 A great percentage of the kids that ate the marshmallow,,they were in trouble.,They did not make it to university.,They had bad grades. Some of them dropped out.,A few were still there with bad grades.,A few had good grades. 
 I had a question in my mind: Would Hispanic kids,react the same way as the American kids?,So I went to Colombia. And I reproduced the experiment.,And it was very funny. I used four, five and six years old kids.,And let me show you what happened. 
 (Spanish) (Laughter) 
 So what happened in Colombia?,Hispanic kids, two out of three ate the marshmallow;,one out of three did not.,This little girl was interesting;,she ate the inside of the marshmallow.,(Laughter),In other words, she wanted us to think that she had not eaten it, so she would get two.,But she ate it.,So we know she'll be successful. But we have to watch her.,(Laughter),She should not go into banking, for example,,or work at a cash register.,But she will be successful. 
 And this applies for everything. Even in sales.,The sales person that --,the customer says, "I want that." And the person says, "Okay, here you are.",That person ate the marshmallow.,If the sales person says, "Wait a second.,Let me ask you a few questions to see if this is a good choice.",Then you sell a lot more.,So this has applications in all walks of life. 
 I end with -- the Koreans did this.,You know what? This is so good,that we want a marshmallow book for children.,We did one for children. And now it is all over Korea.,They are teaching these kids exactly this principle.,And we need to learn that principle here in the States,,because we have a big debt.,We are eating more marshmallows than we are producing.,Thank you so much.The AlloSphere: it's a three-story metal sphere,in an echo-free chamber.,Think of the AlloSphere as a large,,dynamically varying digital microscope,that's connected to a supercomputer.,20 researchers can stand on a bridge,suspended inside of the sphere, and be,completely immersed in their data. 
 Imagine if a team of physicists,could stand inside of an atom,and watch and hear electrons spin.,Imagine if a group of sculptors,could be inside of a lattice of atoms,and sculpt with their material.,Imagine if a team of surgeons could fly,into the brain, as though it was a world,,and see tissues as landscapes,,and hear blood density levels as music.,This is some of the research that you're going to see,that we're undertaking at the AlloSphere. 
 But first a little bit about this group,of artists, scientists, and engineers,that are working together.,I'm a composer, orchestrally-trained,,and the inventor of the AlloSphere.,With my visual artist colleagues, we map,complex mathematical algorithms that unfold in time and space,,visually and sonically.,Our scientist colleagues are finding new patterns,in the information.,And our engineering colleagues are making,one of the largest dynamically varying computers in the world,for this kind of data exploration.,I'm going to fly you into five research projects,in the AlloSphere that are going to take you from,biological macroscopic data,all the way down to electron spin. 
 This first project is called the AlloBrain.,And it's our attempt to quantify beauty,by finding which regions of the brain,are interactive while witnessing something beautiful.,You're flying through the cortex of my colleague's brain.,Our narrative here is real fMRI data,that's mapped visually and sonically.,The brain now a world that we can fly through and interact with.,You see 12 intelligent computer agents,,the little rectangles that are flying in the brain with you.,They're mining blood density levels.,And they're reporting them back to you sonically.,Higher density levels mean,more activity in that point of the brain.,They're actually singing these densities to you,with higher pitches mapped to higher densities. 
 We're now going to move from real biological data,to biogenerative algorithms that create artificial nature,in our next artistic and scientific installation.,In this artistic and scientific installation, biogenerative algorithms,are helping us to understand,self-generation and growth:,very important for simulation in the nanoscaled sciences.,For artists, we're making new worlds,that we can uncover and explore.,These generative algorithms grow over time,,and they interact and communicate as a swarm of insects.,Our researchers are interacting with this data,by injecting bacterial code,,which are computer programs,,that allow these creatures to grow over time.,We're going to move now from the biological,and the macroscopic world,,down into the atomic world,,as we fly into a lattice of atoms.,This is real AFM -- Atomic Force Microscope -- data,from my colleagues in the Solid State Lighting and Energy Center.,They've discovered a new bond,,a new material for transparent solar cells. 
 We're flying through 2,000 lattice of atoms --,oxygen, hydrogen and zinc.,You view the bond in the triangle.,It's four blue zinc atoms,bonding with one white hydrogen atom.,You see the electron flow with the streamlines,we as artists have generated for the scientists.,This is allowing them to find the bonding nodes in any lattice of atoms.,We think it makes a beautiful structural art.,The sound that you're hearing are the actual,emission spectrums of these atoms.,We've mapped them into the audio domain,,so they're singing to you.,Oxygen, hydrogen and zinc have their own signature.,We're going to actually move even further down,as we go from this lattice of atoms,to one single hydrogen atom. 
 We're working with our physicist colleagues,that have given us the mathematical calculations,of the n-dimensional Schrödinger equation in time.,What you're seeing here right now is a superposition of an electron,in the lower three orbitals of a hydrogen atom.,You're actually hearing and seeing the electron flow with the lines.,The white dots are the probability wave,that will show you where the electron is,in any given point of time and space,in this particular three-orbital configuration.,In a minute we're going to move to a two-orbital configuration,,and you're going to notice a pulsing.,And you're going to hear an undulation between the sound.,This is actually a light emitter.,As the sound starts to pulse and contract,,our physicists can tell when a photon is going to be emitted. 
 They're starting to find new mathematical structures,in these calculations.,And they're understanding more about quantum mathematics.,We're going to move even further down,,and go to one single electron spin.,This will be the final project that I show you.,Our colleagues in the Center for Quantum Computation,and Spintronics are actually measuring with their lasers,decoherence in a single electron spin.,We've taken this information and we've,made a mathematical model out of it.,You're actually seeing and hearing,quantum information flow.,This is very important for the next step in simulating,quantum computers and information technology. 
 So these brief examples that I've shown you,give you an idea of the kind of work that we're doing,at the University of California, Santa Barbara,,to bring together, arts, science,and engineering,into a new age of math, science and art.,We hope that all of you will come to see the AlloSphere.,Inspire us to think of new ways that we can use,this unique instrument that we've created at Santa Barbara.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)Chris Anderson: Let's now see the extraordinary speech,that we captured a couple weeks ago. 
 (Music) 
 Jose Antonio Abreu: My dear friends, ladies and gentlemen,,I am overjoyed today,at being awarded the TED Prize,on behalf of all,the distinguished music teachers,,artists and educators from Venezuela,who have selflessly and loyally accompanied me for 35 years,in founding, growing and developing in Venezuela,the National System of Youth and Children's Orchestras and Choirs. 
 Since I was a boy,,in my early childhood,,I always wanted to be a musician,,and, thank God, I made it.,From my teachers, my family and my community,,I had all the necessary support to become a musician.,All my life I've dreamed,that all Venezuelan children,have the same opportunity that I had.,From that desire and from my heart,stemmed the idea to make music,a deep and global reality for my country. 
 From the very first rehearsal, I saw the bright future ahead.,Because the rehearsal meant a great challenge to me.,I had received a donation of 50 music stands,to be used by 100 boys in that rehearsal.,When I arrived at the rehearsal, only 11 kids had shown up,,and I said to myself,,"Do I close the program or multiply these kids?",I decided to face the challenge, and on that same night,,I promised those 11 children I'd turn our orchestra,into one of the leading orchestras in the world.,Two months ago, I remembered that promise I made,,when a distinguished English critic,published an article in the London Times,,asking who could be the winner of the Orchestra World Cup.,He mentioned four great world orchestras,,and the fifth one was Venezuela's Youth Symphony Orchestra.,Today we can say,that art in Latin America,is no longer a monopoly of elites,and that it has become a social right,,a right for all the people. 
 Child: There is no difference here between classes,,nor white or black, nor if you have money or not.,Simply, if you are talented,,if you have the vocation and the will to be here,,you get in. You share with us and make music. 
 JA: During the recent tour,by the Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra of Venezuela,of U.S. and Europe,,we saw how our music moved young audiences,to the bottom of their souls,,how children and adolescents rushed up to the stage,to receive the jackets from our musicians,,how the standing ovations, sometimes 30 minutes long,,seemed to last forever,,and how the public, after the concert was over,,went out into the street to greet our young people in triumph.,This meant not only an artistic triumph,,but also a profound emotional sympathy,between the public of the most advanced nations of the world,and the musical youth of Latin America,,as seen in Venezuela,,giving these audiences a message of music, vitality, energy,,enthusiasm and strength. 
 In its essence, the orchestra and the choir,are much more than artistic structures.,They are examples and schools of social life,,because to sing and to play together,means to intimately coexist,toward perfection and excellence,,following a strict discipline of organization and coordination,in order to seek the harmonic interdependence,of voices and instruments.,That's how they build a spirit of solidarity,and fraternity among them,,develop their self-esteem,and foster the ethical and aesthetical values,related to the music in all its senses.,This is why music is immensely important,in the awakening of sensibility, in the forging of values,and in the training of youngsters,to teach other kids. 
 Child: After all this time here,,music is life.,Nothing else.,Music is life. 
 JA: Each teenager and child in El Sistema has his own story,,and they are all important and of great significance to me.,Let me mention the case of Edicson Ruiz.,He is a boy from a parish in Caracas,who passionately attended to his double bass lessons,at the San Agustin's Junior Orchestra.,With his effort,,and the support of his mother, his family and his community,,he became a principal member,in the double bass segment of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.,We have another well-known case -- Gustavo Dudamel.,He started as a boy member of the children's orchestra,in his hometown, Barquisimeto.,There, he grew as a violinist and as a conductor.,He became the conductor of Venezuela's junior orchestras,,and today conducts the world's greatest orchestras.,He is the musical director of Los Angeles Philharmonic,,and is still the overall leader of Venezuela's junior orchestras.,He was the conductor of the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra,,and he's an unbeatable example,for young musicians in Latin America and the world. 
 The structure of El Sistema,is based on a new and flexible managing style,adapted to the features of each community and region,,and today attends to 300,000 children of the lower and middle class,all over Venezuela.,It's a program of social rescue,and deep cultural transformation,designed for the whole Venezuelan society,with absolutely no distinctions whatsoever,,but emphasizing the vulnerable and endangered social groups. 
 The effect of El Sistema is felt in three fundamental circles:,in the personal/social circle,,in the family circle and in the community.,In the personal/social circle,,the children in the orchestras and choirs,develop their intellectual and emotional side.,The music becomes a source,for developing the dimensions of the human being,,thus elevating the spirit,and leading man to a full development of his personality.,So, the emotional and intellectual profits are huge --,the acquisition of leadership, teaching and training principles,,the sense of commitment, responsibility,,generosity and dedication to others,,and the individual contribution to achieve great collective goals.,All this leads to the development of self-esteem and confidence. 
 Mother Teresa of Calcutta,insisted on something that always impressed me:,the most miserable and tragic thing about poverty,is not the lack of bread or roof,,but the feeling of being no-one --,the feeling of not being anyone,,the lack of identification,,the lack of public esteem.,That's why the child's development,in the orchestra and the choir,provides him with a noble identity,and makes him a role model for his family and community.,It makes him a better student at school,because it inspires in him a sense of responsibility,,perseverance and punctuality that will greatly help him at school. 
 Within the family, the parents' support is unconditional.,The child becomes a role model for both his parents,,and this is very important for a poor child.,Once the child discovers he is important to his family,,he begins to seek new ways of improving himself,and hopes better for himself and his community.,Also, he hopes for social and economic improvements for his own family.,All this makes up a constructive and ascending social dynamic.,The large majority of our children belong, as I already mentioned,,to the most vulnerable strata of the Venezuelan population.,That encourages them to embrace new dreams, new goals,,and progress in the various opportunities,that music has to offer. 
 Finally, in the circle of the community,,the orchestras prove to be the creative spaces of culture,and sources of exchange and new meanings.,The spontaneity music has,excludes it as a luxury item and makes it a patrimony of society.,It's what makes a child play a violin at home,,while his father works in his carpentry.,It's what makes a little girl play the clarinet at home,,while her mother does the housework.,The idea is that the families join with pride and joy,in the activities of the orchestras and the choirs,that their children belong to.,The huge spiritual world that music produces in itself,,which also lies within itself,,ends up overcoming material poverty.,From the minute a child's taught how to play an instrument,,he's no longer poor.,He becomes a child in progress heading for a professional level,,who'll later become a full citizen.,Needless to say that music is the number one prevention,against prostitution, violence, bad habits,,and everything degrading in the life of a child. 
 A few years ago, historian Arnold Toynbee,said that the world was suffering a huge spiritual crisis.,Not an economic or social crisis, but a spiritual one.,I believe that to confront such a crisis,,only art and religion can give proper answers to humanity,,to mankind's deepest aspirations,,and to the historic demands of our times.,Education -- the synthesis of wisdom and knowledge --,is the means to strive for a more perfect, more aware,,more noble and more just society. 
 With passion and enthusiasm we pay profound respects to TED,for its outstanding humanism, the scope of its principles,,for its open and generous promotion of young values.,We hope that TED can contribute in a full and fundamental way,to the building of this new era in the teaching of music,,in which the social, communal, spiritual and vindicatory aims,of the child and the adolescent,become a beacon and a goal for a vast social mission.,No longer putting society at the service of art,,and much less at the services of monopolies of the elite,,but instead art at the service of society,,at the service of the weakest, at the service of the children,,at the service of the sick, at the service of the vulnerable,,and at the service of all those who cry for vindication,through the spirit of their human condition,and the raising up of their dignity.

 CA: We are going live now to Caracas.,We are going live to Caracas,to hear Maestro Abreu's TED Prize wish. 
 JA: Here is my TED Prize wish:,I wish that you'll help to create and document,a special training program,for 50 gifted young musicians,,passionate about their art and social justice,,and dedicated to bringing El Sistema to the United States,and other countries.,Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Some 17 years ago, I became allergic to Delhi's air.,My doctors told me that my lung capacity,had gone down to 70 percent,,and it was killing me.,With the help of IIT,,TERI, and learnings from NASA,,we discovered that there are three,basic green plants,,common green plants, with which,we can grow all the fresh air,we need indoors to keep us healthy.,We've also found that you can,reduce the fresh air requirements,into the building, while maintaining,industry indoor air-quality standards. 
 The three plants are Areca palm,,Mother-in-Law's Tongue and money plant.,The botanical names are in front of you.,Areca palm is a plant which,removes CO2 and converts it into oxygen.,We need four shoulder-high plants per person,,and in terms of plant care,,we need to wipe the leaves,every day in Delhi, and perhaps,once a week in cleaner-air cities.,We had to grow them in vermi manure,,which is sterile, or hydroponics,,and take them outdoors every three to four months.,The second plant is Mother-in-law's Tongue,,which is again a very common plant,,and we call it a bedroom plant,,because it converts CO2 into oxygen at night.,And we need six to eight waist-high plants per person.,The third plant is money plant,,and this is again a very common plant;,preferably grows in hydroponics.,And this particular plant removes formaldehydes,and other volatile chemicals. 
 With these three plants,,you can grow all the fresh air you need.,In fact, you could be in a bottle,with a cap on top, and you would not die at all,,and you would not need any fresh air.,We have tried these plants at our,own building in Delhi, which is a,50,000-square-feet, 20-year-old building.,And it has close to 1,200 such plants for 300 occupants.,Our studies have found that there is,a 42 percent probability of one's blood oxygen,going up by one percent if one stays indoors,in this building for 10 hours.,The government of India has discovered,or published a study to show,that this is the healthiest building in New Delhi.,And the study showed that,,compared to other buildings,,there is a reduced incidence of,eye irritation by 52 percent,,respiratory systems by 34 percent,,headaches by 24 percent,,lung impairment by 12 percent and asthma by nine percent.,And this study has been published on September 8, 2008,,and it's available on the government of India website. 
 Our experience points to an,amazing increase in human productivity,by over 20 percent by using these plants.,And also a reduction in energy requirements in buildings,by an outstanding 15 percent, because you need less fresh air.,We are now replicating this in a,1.75-million-square-feet building,,which will have 60,000 indoor plants. 
 Why is this important?,It is also important for the environment,,because the world's energy,requirements are expected to grow,by 30 percent in the next decade.,40 percent of the world's energy is taken,up by buildings currently,,and 60 percent of the world's population,will be living in buildings in cities,with a population of over one million in the next 15 years.,And there is a growing preference for living,and working in air-conditioned places.,"Be the change you want to see in the world,",said Mahatma Gandhi.,And thank you for listening.,(Applause)So it was about four years ago, five years ago,,I was sitting on a stage in Philadelphia, I think it was,,with a bag similar to this.,And I was pulling a molecule out of this bag.,And I was saying, you don't know this molecule really well,,but your body knows it extremely well.,And I was thinking that your body hated it, at the time,,because we are very immune to this. This is called alpha-gal epitope.,And the fact that pig heart valves have lots of these on them,is the reason that you can't transplant a pig heart valve into a person easily. 
 Actually our body doesn't hate these.,Our body loves these. It eats them.,I mean, the cells in our immune system are always hungry.,And if an antibody is stuck to one of these things,on the cell, it means "that's food.",Now, I was thinking about that and I said, you know, we've got this,immune response to this ridiculous molecule,that we don't make, and we see it a lot in other animals and stuff.,But I said we can't get rid of it,,because all the people who tried to transplant heart valves,found out you can't get rid of that immunity. 
 And I said, why don't you use that?,What if I could stick this molecule,,slap it onto a bacteria,that was pathogenic to me, that had just invaded my lungs?,I mean I could immediately tap into,an immune response that was already there,,where it was not going to take five or six days to develop it --,it was going to immediately attack whatever this thing was on.,It was kind of like the same thing that happens when you,,like when you're getting stopped for a traffic ticket in L.A.,,and the cop drops a bag of marijuana in the back of your car,,and then charges you for possession of marijuana.,It's like this very fast, very efficient way to get people off the street. 
 (Laughter) 
 So you can take a bacteria,that really doesn't make these things at all,,and if you could clamp these on it really well,you have it taken off the street.,And for certain bacteria,we don't have really efficient ways to do that anymore.,Our antibiotics are running out.,And, I mean, the world apparently is running out too.,So probably it doesn't matter 50 years from now --,streptococcus and stuff like that will be rampant --,because we won't be here. But if we are --,(Laughter),we're going to need something to do with the bacteria. 
 So I started working with this thing,,with a bunch of collaborators.,And trying to attach this to things that were,themselves attached to certain specific target zones,,bacteria that we don't like.,And I feel now like George Bush.,It's like "mission accomplished.",So I might be doing something dumb, just like he was doing at the time.,But basically what I was talking about there we've now gotten to work.,And it's killing bacteria. It's eating them. 
 This thing can be stuck, like that little green triangle up there,,sort of symbolizing this right now.,You can stick this to something called a DNA aptamer.,And that DNA aptamer will attach specifically,to a target that you have selected for it.,So you can find a little feature on a bacterium that you don't like,,like Staphylococcus -- I don't like it in particular,,because it killed a professor friend of mine last year.,It doesn't respond to antibiotics. So I don't like it.,And I'm making an aptamer that will have this attached to it.,That will know how to find Staph when it's in your body,,and will alert your immune system to go after it. 
 Here's what happened. See that line on the very top,with the little dots?,That's a bunch of mice that had been poisoned,by our scientist friends down in Texas,,at Brooks Air Base, with anthrax.,And they had also been treated with a drug that we made,that would attack anthrax in particular,,and direct your immune system to it.,You'll notice they all lived, the ones on the top line --,that's a 100 percent survival rate.,And they actually lived another 14 days,,or 28 when we finally killed them,,and took them apart and figured out what went wrong.,Why did they not die?,And they didn't die because they didn't have anthrax anymore.,So we did it. Okay? 
 (Applause) 
 Mission accomplished! 
 (Applause)I'm not at all a cook.,So don't fear, this is not going to be a cooking demonstration.,But I do want to talk to you about something,that I think is dear to all of us.,And that is bread -- something which is as simple,as our basic, most fundamental human staple.,And I think few of us spend the day,without eating bread in some form.,Unless you're on one of these Californian low-carb diets,,bread is standard.,Bread is not only standard in the Western diet.,As I will show to you, it is actually,the mainstay of modern life. 
 So I'm going to bake bread for you.,In the meantime I'm also talking to you,,so my life is going to be complicated. Bear with me.,First of all, a little bit of audience participation.,I have two loaves of bread here.,One is a supermarket standard:,white bread, pre-packaged,,which I'm told is called a Wonderbread.,(Laughter),I didn't know this word until I arrived.,And this is more or less,,a whole-meal, handmade,,small-bakery loaf of bread.,Here we go. I want to see a show of hands.,Who prefers the whole-meal bread?,Okay let me do this differently. Is anybody preferring the Wonderbread at all?,(Laughter),I have two tentative male hands.,(Laughter) 
 Okay, now the question is really,,why is this so?,And I think it is because,we feel that this kind of bread,really is about authenticity.,It's about a traditional way of living.,A way that is perhaps more real, more honest.,This is an image from Tuscany, where we feel,agriculture is still about beauty.,And life is really, too.,And this is about good taste, good traditions.,Why do we have this image?,Why do we feel that this is more true than this?,Well I think it has a lot to do with our history.,In the 10,000 years since agriculture evolved,,most of our ancestors have actually been agriculturalists,or they were closely related to food production.,And we have this mythical image,of how life was in rural areas in the past.,Art has helped us to maintain that kind of image.,It was a mythical past.,Of course, the reality is quite different.,These poor farmers,working the land by hand or with their animals,,had yield levels that are comparable,to the poorest farmers today in West Africa.,But we have, somehow,,in the course of the last few centuries, or even decades,,started to cultivate an image of,a mythical, rural agricultural past. 
 It was only 200 years ago,that we had the advent of the Industrial Revolution.,And while I'm starting to make some bread for you here,,it's very important to understand,what that revolution did to us.,It brought us power. It brought us mechanization, fertilizers.,And it actually drove up our yields.,And even sort of horrible things, like picking beans by hand,,can now be done automatically.,All that is a real, great improvement, as we shall see.,Of course we also, particularly in the last decade,,managed to envelop the world,in a dense chain of supermarkets,,in a chain of global trade.,And it means that you now eat products,,which can come from all around the world.,That is the reality of our modern life.,Now you may prefer this loaf of bread.,Excuse my hands but this is how it is. 
 But actually the real relevant bread,,historically, is this white Wonder loaf.,And don't despise the white bread,because it really, I think,,symbolizes the fact that bread and food,have become plentiful and affordable to all.,And that is a feat that we,are not really conscious of that much.,But it has changed the world.,This tiny bread that is tasteless in some ways,and has a lot of problems,has changed the world.,So what is happening?,Well the best way to look at that is to do a tiny bit of simplistic statistics.,With the advent of the Industrial Revolution,with modernization of agriculture,in the last few decades, since the 1960s,,food availability, per head, in this world,,has increased by 25 percent.,And the world population in the meantime has doubled.,That means that we have now more food available,than ever before in human history.,And that is the result, directly,,of being so successful,at increasing the scale and volume of our production.,And this is true, as you can see, for all countries,,including the so-called developing countries. 
 What happened to our bread in the meantime?,As food became plentiful here,,it also meant that we were able to decrease,the number of people working in agriculture,to something like, on average, in the high income countries,,five percent or less of the population.,In the U.S. only one percent of the people are actually farmers.,And it frees us all up to do other things --,to sit at TED meetings and not to worry about our food.,That is, historically, a really unique situation.,Never before has the responsibility to feed the world,been in the hands of so few people.,And never before have so many people,been oblivious of that fact. 
 So as food became more plentiful, bread became cheaper.,And as it became cheaper, bread manufacturers decided to add in all kinds of things.,We added in more sugar.,We add in raisins and oil and milk,and all kinds of things to make bread,,from a simple food into kind of a support for calories.,And today, bread now is associated with obesity,,which is very strange.,It is the basic, most fundamental food,that we've had in the last ten thousand years.,Wheat is the most important crop -- the first crop we domesticated,and the most important crop we still grow today. 
 But this is now this strange concoction,of high calories.,And that's not only true in this country,,it is true all over the world.,Bread has migrated to tropical countries,,where the middle classes now eat French rolls and hamburgers,and where the commuters,find bread much more handy to use,than rice or cassava.,So bread has become from a main staple,,a source of calories,associated with obesity,and also a source of modernity,,of modern life.,And the whiter the bread, in many countries, the better it is. 
 So this is the story of bread as we know it now.,But of course the price of mass production,has been that we moved large-scale.,And large-scale has meant destruction of many of our landscapes,,destruction of biodiversity --,still a lonely emu here,in the Brazilian cerrado soybean fields.,The costs have been tremendous --,water pollution, all the things you know about, destruction of our habitats. 
 What we need to do is to go back to understanding what our food is about.,And this is where I have to query all of you.,How many of you can actually tell wheat apart from other cereals?,How many of you actually can make a bread,in this way, without starting with a bread machine,or just some kind of packaged flavor?,Can you actually bake bread? Do you know how much a loaf of bread actually costs?,We have become very removed,from what our bread really is,,which, again, evolutionarily speaking,,is very strange.,In fact not many of you know that,our bread, of course, was not a European invention.,It was invented by farmers in Iraq,and Syria in particular.,The tiny spike on the left to the center,is actually the forefather of wheat.,This is where it all comes from,,and where these farmers who actually, ten thousand years ago,,put us on the road of bread. 
 Now it is not surprising,that with this massification and large-scale production,,there is a counter-movement that emerged --,very much also here in California.,The counter-movement says, "Let's go back to this.,Let's go back to traditional farming.,Let's go back to small-scale, to farmers' markets,,small bakeries and all that." Wonderful.,Don't we all agree? I certainly agree.,I would love to go back to Tuscany,to this kind of traditional setting,,gastronomy, good food.,But this is a fallacy.,And the fallacy comes from idealizing,a past that we have forgotten about. 
 If we do this, if we want to stay with traditional small-scale farming,we are going, actually, to relegate,these poor farmers and their husbands --,among whom I have lived for many years,,working without electricity and water, to try to improve their food production --,we relegate them to poverty.,What they want are implements,to increase their production:,something to fertilize the soil,,something to protect their crop and to bring it to a market.,We cannot just think that small-scale,is the solution to the world food problem.,It's a luxury solution for us who can afford it,,if you want to afford it.,In fact we do not want this poor woman,to work the land like this.,If we say just small-scale production,,as is the tendency here,,to go back to local food means that a poor man like Hans Rosling,cannot even eat oranges anymore,because in Scandinavia we don't have oranges.,So local food production is out.,But also we do not want,to relegate to poverty in the rural areas.,And we do not want to relegate,the urban poor to starvation.,So we must find other solutions. 
 One of our problems is that world food production,needs to increase very rapidly --,doubling by about 2030.,The main driver of that is actually meat.,And meat consumption in Southeast Asia and China in particular,is what drives the prices of cereals.,That need for animal protein is going to continue.,We can discuss alternatives in another talk, perhaps one day,,but this is our driving force.,So what can we do?,Can we find a solution to produce more?,Yes. But we need mechanization.,And I'm making a real plea here.,I feel so strongly that you cannot ask a small farmer,to work the land and bend over to grow a hectare of rice,,150,000 times, just to plant a crop and weed it.,You cannot ask people to work under these conditions.,We need clever low-key mechanization,that avoids the problems of the large-scale mechanization that we've had. 
 So what can we do?,We must feed three billion people in cities.,We will not do that through small farmers' markets,because these people have no small farmers' markets at their disposal.,They have low incomes. And they benefit,from cheap, affordable, safe and diverse food.,That's what we must aim for in the next 20 to 30 years. 
 But yes there are some solutions.,And let me just do one simple conceptual thing:,if I plot science as a proxy,for control of the production process and scale.,What you see is that we've started,in the left-hand corner with traditional agriculture,,which was sort of small-scale and low-control.,We've moved towards large-scale and very high control.,What I want us to do is to keep up the science and even get more science in there,but go to a kind of regional scale --,not just in terms of the scale of the fields,,but in terms of the entire food network.,That's where we should move.,And the ultimate may be, but it doesn't apply to cereals,,that we have entirely closed ecosystems --,the horticultural systems right at the top left-hand corner.,So we need to think differently about agriculture science.,Agriculture science for most people -- and there are not many farmers,among you here --,has this name of being bad,,of being about pollution, about large-scale,,about the destruction of the environment.,That is not necessary.,We need more science and not less. And we need good science. 
 So what kind of science can we have?,Well first of all I think,we can do much better on the existing technologies.,Use biotechnology where useful,,particularly in pest and disease resistance.,There are also robots, for example,,who can recognize weeds,with a resolution of half an inch.,We have much cleverer irrigation.,We do not need to spill the water if we don't want to.,And we need to think very dispassionately,about the comparative advantages,of small-scale and large-scale.,We need to think that land is multi-functional.,It has different functions.,There are different ways in which we must use it --,for residential, for nature, for agriculture purposes.,And we also need to re-examine livestock.,Go regional and go to urban food systems.,I want to see fish ponds in parking lots and basements.,I want to have horticulture,and greenhouses on top of residential areas.,And I want to use the energy that comes from those greenhouses,and from the fermentation of crops,to heat our residential areas.,There are all kinds of ways we can do it.,We cannot solve the world food problem,by using biological agriculture.,But we can do a lot more. 
 And the main thing that I would really ask all of you,as you go back to your countries, or as you stay here:,ask your government for an integrated food policy.,Food is as important as energy,,as security, as the environment.,Everything is linked together.,So we can do that. In fact in a densely populated country,like the River Delta, where I live in the Netherlands,,we have combined these functions.,So this is not science fiction. We can combine things,even in a social sense of making,the rural areas more accessible to people --,to house, for example, the chronically sick.,There is all kinds of things we can do. 
 But there is something you must do. It's not enough for me to say,,"Let's get more bold science into agriculture.",You must go back,and think about your own food chain.,Talk to farmers. When was the last time,you went to a farm and talked to a farmer?,Talk to people in restaurants.,Understand where you are in the food chain,,where your food comes from.,Understand that you are part,of this enormous chain of events.,And that frees you up to do other things.,And above all, to me, food is about respect.,It's about understanding, when you eat,,that there are also many people who are still in this situation,,who are still struggling for their daily food.,And the kind of simplistic solutions that we sometimes have,,to think that doing everything by hand,is going to be the solution,,is really not morally justified.,We need to help to lift them out of poverty.,We need to make them proud of being a farmer,because they allow us to survive.,Never before, as I said,,has the responsibility for food,been in the hands of so few.,And never before have we had the luxury,of taking it for granted,because it is now so cheap. 
 And I think there is nobody else who has expressed,better, to me, the idea that food, in the end,,in our own tradition, is something holy.,It's not about nutrients and calories.,It's about sharing. It's about honesty. It's about identity.,Who said this so beautifully was Mahatma Gandhi,,75 years ago, when he spoke about bread.,He did not speak about rice, in India. He said,,"To those who have to go without two meals a day,,God can only appear as bread." 
 And so as I'm finishing my bread here --,and I've been baking it, and I'll try not to burn my hands.,Let me share,with those of you here in the first row.,Let me share some of the food with you.,Take some of my bread.,And as you eat it, and as you try it --,please come and stand up.,Have some of it.,I want you to think that every bite connects you,to the past and the future:,to these anonymous farmers,,that first bred the first wheat varieties;,and to the farmers of today,,who've been making this. And you don't even know who they are.,Every meal you eat,contains ingredients from all across the world.,Everything makes us so privileged,,that we can eat this food, that we don't struggle every day.,And that, I think,,evolutionarily-speaking is unique.,We've never had that before.,So enjoy your bread.,Eat it, and feel privileged.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)It's pretty simple. There are nine, sort of, rules,that I discovered after 35 years of rock climbing.,Most of them are pretty basic. 
 Number one: don't let go --,very sure success method.,But really, truly -- often you think about,letting go way before your body does.,So hang in there,,and you come up with some pretty peculiar solutions. 
 Number two: hesitation is bad.,This is a friction climb, up in Tuolumne Meadows,,in the Yosemite high country.,Friction climbing doesn't have any sort of hard positive edges.,You're climbing on little dimples and nubbins in the rock.,The most friction you have is when you first put your hand,or your foot on the rock.,And then from that point on, you're basically falling.,So momentum is good. Don't stop. 
 Rule number three: have a plan.,This is a climb called the Naked Edge,,in El Dorado Canyon, outside of Boulder.,This climber is on the last pitch of it.,He's actually right about where I fell.,There is about 1,000 feet of air below him.,And all the hard pitches are actually below him.,Often what happens is,you're planning so hard for like,,"How do I get through the hardest part? How do I get through the hardest part?",And then what happens?,You get to the last pitch. It's easy.,And you're completely flamed out. Don't do it.,You have to plan ahead to get to the top. 
 But you also can't forget that each individual move,you have to be able to complete.,This is a climb called the Dike Route,,on Pywjack Dome, up in the Yosemite high country.,The interesting thing about this climb is it's not that hard.,But if you're the leader on it,,at the hardest move, you're looking at about 100 foot fall,,onto some low angle slabs.,So you've got to focus.,You don't want to stop in the middle like,Coleridge's Kubla Kahn.,You've got to keep going. 
 Rule number five: know how to rest.,It's amazing. The best climbers,are the ones that in the most extreme situations,can get their bodies into some position,where they can rest,,regroup, calm themselves, focus,,and keep going.,This is a climb in the Needles, again in California. 
 Fear really sucks because what it means is,you're not focusing on what you're doing.,You're focusing on the consequences of,failing at what you're doing,because any given move should require,all your concentration and thought processes,to execute it effectively. 
 One of the things in climbing is, most people,sort of take it straight on. And they follow the most obvious solution.,This is the Devils Tower in Wyoming,,which is a columnar basalt formation,that most of you probably know from "Close Encounters.",With this, typically crack climbers,would put their hands in and their toes in,and just start climbing.,The cracks are too small to get your toes into,so the only way to climb is using your fingertips,in the cracks,,and using opposing pressure,and forcing yourself up. 
 Rule number eight: strength doesn't always equal success.,In the 35 years I've been a climbing guide,and taught on indoor walls, and stuff like that,,the most important thing I've learned,was, guys will always try to do pull-ups.,Beginning guys, it's like, they thrash, they thrash,,they get 15 feet up --,and they can do about 15 pull-ups right --,And then they just flame out.,Women are much more in balance,because they don't have that idea,that they're going to be able to do 100 pull-ups.,They think about how to get the weight over their feet,because it's sort of natural -- they carry you all day long.,So balance is really critical,,and keeping your weight on your feet,,which is your strongest muscle. 
 And of course there is rule number nine.,I came up with rule number nine after,I actually didn't plan for a fall,,and went about 40 feet and cracked a rib.,Once you get to that point where you know it's going to happen,,you need to start thinking about how you're going to let go,because that is the critical piece,of not getting hurt --,how you're going to fall onto the rope,,or if you're climbing without a rope,,fall to a place where you can actually control the fall.,So don't hang on till the bitter end.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)When most people think about the beginnings,of AIDS, they're gonna think back to the 1980s.,And certainly, this was the decade in which we discovered AIDS,and the virus that causes it, HIV.,But in fact this virus crossed over into humans many decades before,,from chimpanzees, where the virus originated, into humans who hunt these apes. 
 This photo was taken before the Great Depression,in Brazzaville, Congo.,At this time, there were thousands of individuals,,we think, that were infected with HIV. 
 So I have a couple of really important questions for you.,If this virus was in thousands,of individuals at this point,,why was it the case that it took us until 1984,to be able to discover this virus?,OK now, more importantly,,had we been there in the '40s and '50s, '60s,,had we seen this disease, had we understood,exactly what was going on with it, how might that have changed and completely,transformed the nature of the way this pandemic moved? 
 In fact, this is not unique to HIV. The vast majority of,viruses come from animals.,And you can kind of think of this as a pyramid of this bubbling up of viruses,from animals into human populations.,But only at the very top of this pyramid do these things become completely human.,Nevertheless, we spend the vast majority,of our energy focused on this level of the pyramid,,trying to tackle things that are already completely adapted to human beings,,that are going to be very very difficult to address --,as we've seen in the case of HIV. 
 So during the last 15 years,,I've been working to actually study the earlier interface here --,what I've labeled "viral chatter," which was a term coined,by my mentor Don Burke.,This is the idea that we can study the sort of,pinging of these viruses into human populations,,the movement of these agents over into humans;,and by capturing this moment,,we might be able to move to a situation where we can catch them early. 
 OK, so this is a picture, and I'm going to show you,some pictures now from the field.,This is a picture of a central African hunter.,It's actually a fairly common picture.,One of the things I want you to note from it,is blood -- that you see a tremendous amount of blood contact.,This was absolutely key for us. This is a,very intimate form of connection.,So if we're going to study viral chatter, we need to,get to these populations who have intensive contact with wild animals. 
 And so we've been studying people like this individual.,We collect blood from them, other specimens.,We look at the diseases, which are in the animals as well as the humans.,And ideally, this is going to allow us to catch these things,early on, as they're moving over into human populations.,And the basic objective of this work is not to just,go out once and look at these individuals,,but to establish thousands of individuals,in these populations that we would monitor,continuously on a regular basis.,When they were sick, we would collect specimens from them. 
 We would actually enlist them --,which we've done now -- to collect specimens from animals.,We give them these little pieces of filter paper.,When they sample from animals,,they collect the blood on the filter paper,and this allows us to identify yet-unknown viruses from exactly the right animals --,the ones that are actually being hunted. 
 (Video) Narrator: Deep in a remote region of Cameroon,,two hunters stalk their prey.,Their names are Patrice and Patee.,They're searching for bush meat;,forest animals they can kill to feed their families.,Patrice and Patee set out most days to go out hunting,in the forest around their homes.,They have a series of traps, of snares that they've set up,to catch wild pigs, snakes, monkeys,,rodents -- anything they can, really.,Patrice and Patee have been out for hours but found nothing.,The animals are simply gone. 
 We stop for a drink of water.,Then there is a rustle in the brush.,A group of hunters approach,,their packs loaded with wild game.,There's at least three viruses,that you know about, which are in this particular monkey. 
 Nathan Wolfe: This species, yeah. And there's many many more pathogens,that are present in these animals.,These individuals are at specific risk,,particularly if there's blood contact, they're at risk for transmission,and possibly infection with novel viruses. 
 Narrator: As the hunters display their kills, something surprising happens.,They show us filter paper they've used to collect the animals' blood.,The blood will be tested for zoonotic viruses,,part of a program Dr. Wolfe has spent years setting up. 
 NW: So this is from this animal right here,,Greater Spot-Nosed Guenon.,Every person who has one of those filter papers has at least,,at a minimum, been through our basic health education,about the risks associated with these activities,,which presumably, from our perspective,,gives them the ability to decrease their own risk,,and then obviously the risk to their families,,the village, the country, and the world. 
 NW: OK, before I continue, I think it's important to take just a moment,to talk about bush meat. Bush meat is the hunting of wild game.,OK? And you can consider all sorts of different bush meat.,I'm going to be talking about this.,When your children and grandchildren,sort of pose questions to you about this period of time,,one of the things they're gonna ask you,,is how it was they we allowed some of our closest living relatives,,some of the most valuable and endangered species,on our planet, to go extinct because we,weren't able to address some of the issues,of poverty in these parts of the world. 
 But in fact that's not the only question they're going to ask you about this.,They're also going to ask you the question,that when we knew that this was the way that HIV entered,into the human population,,and that other diseases had the potential to enter like this,,why did we let these behaviors continue?,Why did we not find some other solution to this?,They're going to say, in regions of profound,instability throughout the world,,where you have intense poverty, where populations are growing,and you don't have sustainable resources like this,,this is going to lead to food insecurity. 
 But they're also going to ask you probably a different question.,It's one that I think we all need to ask ourselves,,which is, why we thought the responsibility rested with this individual here.,Now this is the individual -- you can see just right up over his right shoulder --,this is the individual that hunted the monkey,from the last picture that I showed you.,OK, take a look at his shirt.,You know, take a look at his face.,Bush meat is one of the central crises,,which is occurring in our population right now,,in humanity, on this planet.,But it can't be the fault of somebody like this.,OK? And solving it cannot be his responsibility alone.,There's no easy solutions,,but what I'm saying to you is that we neglect this problem,at our own peril. 
 So, in 1998, along with my mentors,Don Burke and Colonel Mpoudi-Ngole,,we went to actually start this work,in Central Africa, to work with hunters,in this part of the world.,And my job -- at that time I was a post-doctoral fellow,,and I was really tasked with setting this up.,So I said to myself, "OK, great --,we're gonna collect all kinds of specimens. We're gonna go to all these,different locations. It's going to be wonderful.",You know, I looked at the map; I picked out 17 sites;,I figured, no problem.,(Laughter) 
 Needless to say, I was drastically wrong.,This is challenging work to do.,Fortunately, I had and continue to have,an absolutely wonderful team of colleagues and collaborators in my own team,,and that's the only way that this work can really occur.,We have a whole range of challenges about this work. 
 One of them is just obtaining trust,from individuals that we work with in the field.,The person you see on the right hand side is Paul DeLong-Minutu.,He's one of the best communicators that I've really ever dealt with.,When I arrived I didn't speak a word of French,,and I still seemed to understand what it was he was saying.,Paul worked for years,on the Cameroonian national radio and television,,and he spoke about health issues. He was a health correspondent.,So we figured we'd hire this person -- when we got there he could,be a great communicator.,When we would get to these rural villages, though, what we found out,is that no one had television,,so they wouldn't recognize his face.,But -- when he began to speak,they would actually recognize his voice from the radio.,And this was somebody who had incredible,potential to spread aspects of our message,,whether it be with regards to wildlife conservation,or health prevention. 
 Often we run into obstacles. This is us coming back from,one of these very rural sites,,with specimens from 200 individuals,that we needed to get back to the lab within 48 hours.,I like to show this shot -- this is,Ubald Tamoufe, who's the lead,investigator in our Cameroon site.,Ubald laughs at me when I show this photo,because of course you can't see his face.,But the reason I like to show the shot,is because you can see that he's about to solve this problem.,(Laughter),Which -- which he did, which he did.,Just a few quick before and after shots.,This was our laboratory before.,This is what it looks like now.,Early on, in order to ship our specimens,,we had to have dry ice. To get dry ice we had to go,to the breweries -- beg, borrow, steal to get these folks to give it to us.,Now we have our own liquid nitrogen.,I like to call our laboratory the coldest place in Central Africa -- it might be.,And here's a shot of me, this is the before shot of me.,(Laughter),No comment. 
 So what happened? So during the 10 years that we've been doing,this work, we actually surprised ourselves.,We made a number of discoveries.,And what we've found is that if you look in the right place,,you can actually monitor the flow,of these viruses into human populations.,That gave us a tremendous amount of hope.,What we've found is a whole range of new viruses in these individuals,,including new viruses in the same group,as HIV -- so, brand new retroviruses.,And let's face it, any new retrovirus in the,human population -- it's something we should be aware of.,It's something we should be following. It's not something,that we should be surprised by. 
 Needless to say in the past,these viruses entering into these rural communities,might very well have gone extinct.,That's no longer the case. Logging roads provide access to urban areas.,And critically, what happens in central Africa,doesn't stay in Central Africa.,So, once we discovered that it was really possible,that we could actually do this monitoring,,we decided to move this from research, to,really attempt to phase up to a global monitoring effort.,Through generous support and partnership,scientifically with Google.org and the Skoll Foundation,,we were able to start the Global Viral Forecasting Initiative,and begin work in four different sites,in Africa and Asia.,Needless to say, different populations from different parts of the world,have different sorts of contact.,So it's not just hunters in Central Africa.,It's also working in live animal markets --,these wet markets -- which is exactly the place where,SARS emerged in Asia.,But really, this is just the beginning from our perspective. 
 Our objective right now, in addition to,deploying to these sites and getting everything moving,,is to identify new partners,because we feel like this effort needs to be extended,to probably 20 or more sites throughout the world -- to viral hotspots --,because really the idea here is to cast an incredibly wide net,so that we can catch these things, ideally,,before they make it to blood banks,,sexual networks, airplanes. And that's really our objective.,There was a time not very long ago,when the discovery of unknown organisms,was something that held incredible awe for us.,It had potential to really change the way that we saw ourselves,,and thought about ourselves. 
 Many people, I think, on our planet right now,despair, and they think,we've reached a point where we've discovered most of the things.,I'm going tell you right now: please don't despair.,If an intelligent extra-terrestrial,was taxed with writing the encyclopedia of life on our planet,,27 out of 30 of these volumes,would be devoted to bacteria and virus,,with just a few of the volumes left,for plants, fungus and animals,,humans being a footnote;,interesting footnote but a footnote nonetheless.,This is honestly the most exciting period,ever for the study of unknown life forms on our planet.,The dominant things that exist here,we know almost nothing about.,And yet finally, we have the tools, which will allow us to actually explore that world,and understand them. 
 Thank you very much.,(Applause)Interestingly, Charles Darwin,was born a very lightly pigmented man,,in a moderately-to-darkly pigmented world.,Over the course of his life,,Darwin had great privilege.,He lived in a fairly wealthy home.,He was raised by very supportive and interested parents.,And when he was in his 20s,he embarked upon a remarkable voyage non the ship the Beagle.,And during the course of that voyage,,he saw remarkable things:,tremendous diversity of plants and animals, and humans.,And the observations that he made,on that epic journey,were to be eventually distilled,into his wonderful book, "On the Origin of Species,",published 150 years ago. 
 Now what is so interesting,and to some, the extent, what's a bit infamous,about "The Origin of Species,",is that there is only one line in it,about human evolution.,"Light will be thrown on the origin of man,and his history.",It wasn't until much longer,,much later,,that Darwin actually spoke,and wrote about humans. 
 Now in his years of,traveling on the Beagle,,and from listening to the accounts,or explorers and naturalists,,he knew that skin color,was one of the most important ways,in which people varied.,And he was somewhat interested in the pattern of skin color.,He knew that darkly pigmented peoples,were found close to the equator;,lightly pigmented peoples, like himself,,were found closer to the poles. 
 So what did he make of all this?,Well he didn't write anything about it in The Origin of Species.,But much later, in 1871,,he did have something to say about it.,And it was quite curious. He said,,"Of all the differences between the races of men,,the color of the skin is the most conspicuous,and one of the best marked.",And he went on to say,,"These differences do not coincide,with corresponding differences in climate.",So he had traveled all around.,He had seen people of different colors,living in different places.,And yet he rejected the idea,that human skin pigmentation,was related to the climate. 
 If only Darwin lived today.,If only Darwin had NASA.,Now, one of the wonderful things that NASA does,is it puts up a variety of satellites,that detect all sort of interesting things about our environment.,And for many decades now,there have been a series of TOMS satellites,that have collected data about the radiation of the Earth's surface.,The TOMS 7 satellite data, shown here,,show the annual average,ultraviolet radiation at the Earth's surface.,Now the really hot pink and red areas,are those parts of the world that receive the highest amounts,of UV during the year.,The incrementally cooler colors --,blues, greens, yellows, and finally grays --,indicate areas of much lower ultraviolet radiation. 
 What's significant to the story of human skin pigmentation,is just how much of the Northern Hemisphere,is in these cool gray zones.,This has tremendous implications for our understanding,of the evolution of human skin pigmentation.,And what Darwin could not appreciate,,or didn't perhaps want to appreciate at the time,,is that there was a fundamental relationship,between the intensity of ultraviolet radiation,and skin pigmentation.,And that skin pigmentation itself,was a product of evolution.,And so when we look at a map of skin color,,and predicted skin color, as we know it today,,what we see is a beautiful gradient,from the darkest skin pigmentations toward the equator,,and the lightest ones toward the poles. 
 What's very, very important here,is that the earliest humans,evolved in high-UV environments,,in equatorial Africa.,The earliest members of our lineage,,the genus Homo, were darkly pigmented.,And we all share this incredible heritage,of having originally been,darkly pigmented,,two million to one and half million years ago. 
 Now what happened in our history?,Let's first look at the relationship,of ultraviolet radiation to the Earth's surface.,In those early days of our evolution,,looking at the equator,,we were bombarded by high levels of ultraviolet radiation.,The UVC, the most energetic type,,was occluded by the Earth's atmosphere.,But UVB and UVA,especially, came in unimpeded.,UVB turns out to be incredibly important.,It's very destructive,,but it also catalyzes the production of vitamin D in the skin,,vitamin D being a molecule that we very much need,for our strong bones, the health of our immune system,,and myriad other important functions in our bodies. 
 So, living at the equator, we got,lots and lots of ultraviolet radiation,and the melanin --,this wonderful, complex, ancient polymer,compound in our skin --,served as a superb natural sunscreen.,This polymer is amazing,because it's present in so many different organisms.,Melanin, in various forms, has probably been on the Earth,a billion years,,and has been recruited over and over again,by evolution, as often happens.,Why change it if it works? 
 So melanin was recruited, in our lineage,,and specifically in our earliest ancestors,evolving in Africa,,to be a natural sunscreen.,Where it protected the body,against the degradations of ultraviolet radiation,,the destruction, or damage to DNA,,and the breakdown of a very important molecule called folate,,which helps to fuel cell production,,and reproduction in the body.,So, it's wonderful. We evolved this very protective,,wonderful covering of melanin. 
 But then we moved.,And humans dispersed -- not once, but twice.,Major moves, outside of our equatorial homeland,,from Africa into other parts of the Old World,,and most recently, into the New World.,When humans dispersed into these latitudes,,what did they face?,Conditions were significantly colder,,but they were also less intense,with respect to the ultraviolet regime. 
 So if we're somewhere in the Northern Hemisphere,,look at what's happening to the ultraviolet radiation.,We're still getting a dose of UVA.,But all of the UVB,,or nearly all of it,,is dissipated through the thickness of the atmosphere.,In the winter, when you are skiing in the Alps,,you may experience ultraviolet radiation.,But it's all UVA,,and, significantly, that UVA,has no ability to make vitamin D in your skin. 
 So people inhabiting northern hemispheric environments,were bereft of the potential,to make vitamin D in their skin for most of the year.,This had tremendous consequences,for the evolution of human skin pigmentation.,Because what happened, in order to ensure health and well-being,,these lineages of people,dispersing into the Northern Hemisphere,lost their pigmentation.,There was natural selection,for the evolution of lightly pigmented skin. 
 Here we begin to see the evolution,of the beautiful sepia rainbow,that now characterizes all of humanity.,Lightly pigmented skin evolved not just once,,not just twice, but probably three times.,Not just in modern humans,,but in one of our distant unrelated ancestors,,the Neanderthals.,A remarkable, remarkable testament,to the power of evolution.,Humans have been on the move for a long time.,And just in the last 5,000 years,,in increasing rates, over increasing distances.,Here are just some of the biggest movements of people,,voluntary movements, in the last 5,000 years. 
 Look at some of the major latitudinal transgressions:,people from high UV areas,going to low UV and vice versa.,And not all these moves were voluntary.,Between 1520 and 1867,,12 million, 500 people,were moved from high UV,to low UV areas,in the transatlantic slave trade.,Now this had all sorts of invidious social consequences.,But it also had deleterious,health consequences to people. 
 So what? We've been on the move.,We're so clever we can overcome all of these,seeming biological impediments.,Well, often we're unaware,of the fact that we're living,in environments in which our skin,is inherently poorly adapted.,Some of us with lightly pigmented skin,live in high-UV areas.,Some of us with darkly pigmented skin,live in low-UV areas.,These have tremendous consequences for our health. 
 We have to, if we're lightly pigmented,,be careful about the problems of skin cancer,,and destruction of folate in our bodies,,by lots of sun.,Epidemiologists and doctors,have been very good about telling us,about protecting our skin.,What they haven't been so good about instructing people,is the problem of darkly pigmented people,living in high latitude areas,,or working inside all the time. 
 Because the problem there is just as severe,,but it is more sinister,,because vitamin D deficiency,,from a lack of ultraviolet B radiation,,is a major problem.,Vitamin D deficiency creeps up on people,,and causes all sorts of health problems to their bones,,to their gradual decay of their immune systems,,or loss of immune function,,and probably some problems,with their mood and health,,their mental health. 
 So we have, in skin pigmentation,,one of these wonderful products of evolution,that still has consequences for us today.,And the social consequences,,as we know, are incredibly profound.,We live in a world where we,have lightly and darkly pigmented people,living next to one another,,but often brought into proximity initially,as a result of very invidious social interactions.,So how can we overcome this?,How can we begin to understand it?,Evolution helps us. 
 200 years after Darwin's birthday,,we have the first moderately pigmented President of the United States.,(Applause),How wonderful is that?,(Applause),This man is significant for a whole host of reasons.,But we need to think about how he compares,,in terms of his pigmentation, to other people on Earth.,He, as one of many urban admixed populations,,is very emblematic,of a mixed parentage, of a mixed pigmentation.,And he resembles, very closely,,people with moderate levels of pigmentation,who live in southern Africa, or Southeast Asia. 
 These people have a tremendous potential,to tan, to develop more pigment in their skin,,as a result of exposure to sun.,They also run the risk of vitamin D deficiency,,if they have desk jobs, like that guy.,So lets all wish for his great health,,and his awareness of his own skin pigmentation. 
 Now what is wonderful,about the evolution of human skin pigmentation,,and the phenomenon of pigmentation,,is that it is the demonstration,,the evidence, of evolution,by natural selection,,right on your body.,When people ask you, "What is the evidence for evolution?",You don't have to think about some exotic examples, or fossils.,You just have to look at your skin. 
 Darwin, I think, would have appreciated this,,even though he eschewed the importance,of climate on the evolution of pigmentation during his own life.,I think, were he able to look,at the evidence we have today, he would understand it.,He would appreciate it.,And most of all, he would teach it. 
 You, you can teach it.,You can touch it.,You can understand it.,Take it out of this room.,Take your skin color,,and celebrate it.,Spread the word.,You have the evolution,of the history of our species,,part of it, written in your skin.,Understand it. Appreciate it. Celebrate it.,Go out. Isn't it beautiful? Isn't it wonderful?,You are the products of evolution.,Thank you.,(Applause)We see with the eyes,,but we see with the brain as well.,And seeing with the brainnis often called imagination.,And we are familiar withnthe landscapes of our own imagination,,our inscapes. nWe've lived with them all our lives.,But there are also hallucinations as well,,and hallucinations nare completely different.,They don't seem to be of our creation.,They don't seem to be under our control.,They seem to come from the outside,,and to mimic perception. 
 So I am going to be talkingnabout hallucinations,,and a particular sortnof visual hallucination,which I see among my patients.,A few months ago, I got a phone call,from a nursing home where I work.,They told me that one of their residents,nan old lady in her 90s,,was seeing things,,and they wondered if she'd gone bonkers,or, because she was an old lady,,whether she'd had a stroke,nor whether she had Alzheimer's. 
 And so they asked me ifnI would come and see Rosalie,,the old lady.,I went in to see her.,It was evident straight away,that she was perfectly sane,and lucid and nof good intelligence,,but she'd been very startlednand very bewildered,,because she'd been seeing things.,And she told me --,the nurses hadn't mentioned this --,that she was blind,,that she had been completely blindnfrom macular degeneration for five years.,But now, for the last few days,nshe'd been seeing things. 
 So I said, "What sort of things?",And she said, "People in Eastern dress,,in drapes, walking up and down stairs.,A man who turns towards me and smiles.,But he has huge teethnon one side of his mouth.,Animals too.,I see a white building.nIt's snowing, a soft snow.,I see this horse with a harness,ndragging the snow away.,Then, one night, the scene changes.,I see cats and dogs walking towards me.,They come to a certain pointnand then stop.,Then it changes again.,I see a lot of children.nThey are walking up and down stairs.,They wear bright colors, rose and blue,,like Eastern dress." 
 Sometimes, she said,nbefore the people come on,,she may hallucinatenpink and blue squares on the floor,,which seem to go up to the ceiling.,I said, "Is this like a dream?",And she said, "No, it's notnlike a dream. It's like a movie.",She said, "It's got color.nIt's got motion.,But it's completely silent,nlike a silent movie.",And she said thatnit's a rather boring movie.,She said, "All these peoplenwith Eastern dress,,walking up and down,nvery repetitive, very limited.",(Laughter) 
 And she has a sense of humor.,She knew it was a hallucination.,But she was frightened.nShe'd lived 95 years,and she'd never hadna hallucination before.,She said that the hallucinationsnwere unrelated,to anything she was thinkingnor feeling or doing,,that they seemed to come onnby themselves, or disappear.,She had no control over them.,She said she didn't recognize,any of the people or places,in the hallucinations.,And none of the peoplenor the animals,,well, they all seemed oblivious of her.,And she didn't know what was going on.,She wondered if she was going mad,or losing her mind. 
 Well, I examined her carefully.,She was a bright old lady,,perfectly sane. She hadnno medical problems.,She wasn't on any medicationsnwhich could produce hallucinations.,But she was blind.,And I then said to her,,"I think I know what you have.",I said, "There is a special formnof visual hallucination,which may go with deterioratingnvision or blindness.,This was originally described," I said,,"right back in the 18th century,,by a man called Charles Bonnet.,And you have Charles Bonnet syndrome.,There is nothing wrong with your brain.nThere is nothing wrong with your mind.,You have Charles Bonnet syndrome." 
 And she was very relieved at this,,that there was nothingnseriously the matter,,and also rather curious.,She said, "Who is this Charles Bonnet?",She said, "Did he have them himself?",And she said, "Tell all the nurses,that I have Charles Bonnet syndrome.",(Laughter),"I'm not crazy. I'm not demented.nI have Charles Bonnet syndrome.",Well, so I did tell the nurses. 
 Now this, for me, is a common situation.,I work in old-age homes, largely.,I see a lot of elderly people,who are hearing impairednor visually impaired.,About 10 percentnof the hearing impaired people,get musical hallucinations.,And about 10 percentnof the visually impaired people,get visual hallucinations.,You don't have to be completely blind,,only sufficiently impaired. 
 Now with the original descriptionnin the 18th century,,Charles Bonnet did not have them.,His grandfather had these hallucinations.,His grandfather was a magistrate,nan elderly man.,He'd had cataract surgery.,His vision was pretty poor.,And in 1759, he described to his grandson,various things he was seeing. 
 The first thing he said was he saw,a handkerchief in midair.,It was a large blue handkerchief,with four orange circles.,And he knew it was a hallucination.,You don't have handkerchiefs in midair.,And then he saw a big wheel in midair.,But sometimes he wasn't surenwhether he was hallucinating or not,,because the hallucinations would fit,in the context of the visions.,So on one occasion,nwhen his granddaughters were visiting them,,he said, "And who are thesenhandsome young men with you?",And they said, "Alas, Grandpapa,nthere are no handsome young men.",And then the handsomenyoung men disappeared.,It's typical of these hallucinations,that they may come in a flashnand disappear in a flash.,They don't usually fade in and out.,They are rather sudden,nand they change suddenly. 
 Charles Lullin, the grandfather,,saw hundreds of different figures,,different landscapes of all sorts.,On one occasion, he saw a mannin a bathrobe smoking a pipe,,and realized it was himself.,That was the only figure he recognized.,On one occasion when he was walkingnin the streets of Paris,,he saw -- this was real -- a scaffolding.,But when he got back home,nhe saw a miniature of the scaffolding,six inches high, on his study table.,This repetition of perception,is sometimes called palinopsia. 
 With him and with Rosalie,,what seems to be going on --,and Rosalie said, "What's going on?" --,and I said that as you lose vision,,as the visual parts of the brainnare no longer getting any input,,they become hyperactive and excitable,,and they start to fire spontaneously.,And you start to see things.,The things you seencan be very complicated indeed. 
 With another patient of mine,,who, also had some vision,,the vision she had could be disturbing.,On one occasion, she said she saw,a man in a striped shirt in a restaurant.,And he turned around. And then,he divided into six figuresnin striped shirts,,who started walking towards her.,And then the six figures came together again,nlike a concertina.,Once, when she was driving,,or rather, her husband was driving,,the road divided into four,and she felt herself goingnsimultaneously up four roads. 
 She had very mobilenhallucinations as well.,A lot of them had to do with a car.,Sometimes she would see a teenage boy,sitting on the hood of the car.,He was very tenaciousnand he moved rather gracefully,when the car turned.,And then when they came to a stop,,the boy would do a sudden vertical takeoff,n100 foot in the air,,and then disappear. 
 Another patient of minenhad a different sort of hallucination.,This was a woman whondidn't have trouble with her eyes,,but the visual parts of her brain,,a little tumor in the occipital cortex.,And, above all, she would see cartoons.,These cartoons would be transparent,and would covernhalf the visual field, like a screen.,And especially she sawncartoons of Kermit the Frog.,(Laughter),Now, I don't watch Sesame Street,,but she made a point of saying,,"Why Kermit?" she said,n"Kermit the Frog means nothing to me.,You know, I was wonderingnabout Freudian determinants.,Why Kermit?,Kermit the Frog means nothing to me." 
 She didn't mind the cartoons too much.,But what did disturb hernwas she got very persistent,images or hallucinations of faces,and as with Rosalie,nthe faces were often deformed,,with very large teeth or very large eyes.,And these frightened her.,Well, what is going on with these people?,As a physician, I have to trynand define what's going on,,and to reassure people,,especially to reassure themnthat they're not going insane. 
 Something like 10 percent, as I said,,of visually impaired people get these.,But no more than one percentnof the people acknowledge them,,because they are afraidnthey will be seen as insane or something.,And if they do mention themnto their own doctors,they may be misdiagnosed. 
 In particular,nthe notion is that if you see,things or hear things, you're going mad,,but the psychotic hallucinations nare quite different.,Psychotic hallucinations,nwhether they are visual or vocal,,they address you. They accuse you.,They seduce you. They humiliate you.,They jeer at you.,You interact with them.,There is none of this qualitynof being addressed,with these Charles Bonnet hallucinations.,There is a film. You're seeing a filmnwhich has nothing to do with you,,or that's how people think about it. 
 There is also a rare thingncalled temporal lobe epilepsy,,and sometimes, if one has this,,one may feel oneself transported back,to a time and place in the past.,You're at a particular road junction.,You smell chestnuts roasting.,You hear the traffic.nAll the senses are involved.,And you're waiting for your girl.,And it's that Tuesdaynevening back in 1982.,And the temporal lobe hallucinations,are all-sense hallucinations,,full of feeling, full of familiarity,,located in space and time,,coherent, dramatic.,The Charles Bonnetnones are quite different. 
 So in the Charles Bonnet hallucinations,,you have all sorts of levels,,from the geometrical hallucinations --,the pink and blue squares the woman had --,up to quite elaborate hallucinations,with figures and especially faces.,Faces, and sometimes deformed faces,,are the single commonest thing,in these hallucinations.,And one of the secondncommonest is cartoons. 
 So, what is going on?,Fascinatingly, in the last few years,,it's been possible to donfunctional brain imagery,,to do fMRI on peoplenas they are hallucinating.,And in fact, to find that different parts,of the visual brain are activated,as they are hallucinating.,When people have thesensimple geometrical hallucinations,,the primary visual cortex is activated.,This is the part of the brainnwhich perceives edges and patterns.,You don't form imagesnwith your primary visual cortex. 
 When images are formed,,a higher part of the visual cortex,is involved in the temporal lobe.,And in particular,none area of the temporal lobe,is called the fusiform gyrus.,And it's known that if peoplenhave damage in the fusiform gyrus,,they maybe losenthe ability to recognize faces.,But if there is an abnormal activitynin the fusiform gyrus,,they may hallucinate faces,,and this is exactly what you findnin some of these people.,There is an areanin the anterior part of this gyrus,where teeth and eyes are represented,,and that part of the gyrus is activated,when people getnthe deformed hallucinations. 
 There is another part of the brain,which is especially activated,when one sees cartoons.,It's activated whennone recognizes cartoons,,when one draws cartoons,nand when one hallucinates them.,It's very interestingnthat that should be specific.,There are other parts of the brainnwhich are specifically involved,with the recognition and hallucination,of buildings and landscapes. 
 Around 1970, it was foundnthat there were not only parts of the brain,,but particular cells.,"Face cells" were discovered around 1970.,And now we knownthat there are hundreds of other,sorts of cells,,which can be very, very specific.,So you may not only have,"car" cells,,you may have "Aston Martin" cells.,(Laughter),I saw an Aston Martin this morning.,I had to bring it in.,And now it's in there somewhere.,(Laughter) 
 Now, at this level, in what's callednthe inferotemporal cortex,,there are only visual images,,or figments or fragments.,It's only at higher levels,that the other senses join in,and there are connectionsnwith memory and emotion.,And in the Charles Bonnet syndrome,,you don't go to those higher levels.,You're in these levelsnof inferior visual cortex,where you have thousandsnand tens of thousands,and millions of images,,or figments,nor fragmentary figments,,all neurally encoded,in particular cellsnor small clusters of cells. 
 Normally these are all part of,the integrated streamnof perception, or imagination,,and one is not conscious of them.,It is only if onenis visually impaired or blind,that the process is interrupted.,And instead of getting normal perception,,you're getting an anarchic,,convulsive stimulation, or release,,of all of these visual cells,in the inferotemporal cortex.,So, suddenly you see a face.nSuddenly you see a car.,Suddenly this, and suddenly that.,The mind does its best to organize,and to give some sortnof coherence to this,,but not terribly successfully. 
 When these were first described,,it was thought thatnthey could be interpreted like dreams.,But in fact people say,,"I don't recognize the people.nI can't form any associations.","Kermit means nothing to me.",You don't get anywherenthinking of them as dreams. 
 Well, I've morenor less said what I wanted.,I think I just want to recapitulate,and say this is common.,Think of the number of blind people.,There must be hundredsnof thousands of blind people,who have these hallucinations,,but are too scared to mention them.,So this sort of thingnneeds to be brought into,notice, for patients,nfor doctors, for the public.,Finally, I think they are,infinitely interesting and valuable,,for giving one some insightnas to how the brain works. 
 Charles Bonnet said, 250 years ago --,he wondered how,nthinking these hallucinations,,how, as he put it,nthe theater of the mind,could be generatednby the machinery of the brain.,Now, 250 years later,,I think we're beginningnto glimpse how this is done.,Thanks very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: That was superb.nThank you so much.,You speak about these thingsnwith so much insight,and empathy for your patients.,Have you yourself experiencednany of the syndromes you write about? 
 Oliver Sacks: I was afraid you'd ask that.,(Laughter),Well, yeah, a lot of them.,And actually I'm a littlenvisually impaired myself.,I'm blind in one eye,nand not terribly good in the other.,And I see the geometrical hallucinations.,But they stop there. 
 CA: And they don't disturb you?,Because you understand what's doing it,nit doesn't make you worried? 
 OS: Well they don't disturb menany more than my tinnitus,,which I ignore.,They occasionally interest me,,and I have many picturesnof them in my notebooks.,I've gone and had an fMRI myself,,to see how my visual cortexnis taking over.,And when I see all these hexagons,and complex things,nwhich I also have,,in visual migraine,,I wonder whether everyonensees things like this,,and whether thingsnlike cave art or ornamental art,may have been derived from them a bit. 
 CA: That was an utterly,nutterly fascinating talk.,Thank you so much for sharing. 
 OS: Thank you. Thank you.,(Applause)I used to be a Malthusian.,This was my mental model of the world:,exploding population, small planet;,it's going to lead to ugly things.,But I'm moving past Malthus,,because I think that we just might be about 150 years,from a kind of new enlightenment. 
 Here's why.,This is the U.N.'s population data,,you may have seen, for the world.,And the world's population expected to top out,at something hopefully a bit less than 10 billion, late this century.,And after that, most likely it's going to begin to decline.,So what then?,Most of the economic models are built around scarcity and growth.,So a lot of economists,look at declining population,and expect to see stagnation, maybe depression.,But a declining population is going to have,at least two very beneficial economic effects. 
 One: fewer people on a fixed amount of land,make investing in property a bad bet.,In the cities, a lot of the cost of property,is actually wrapped up in its speculative value.,Take away land speculation,,price of land drops.,And that begins to lift a heavy burden,off the world's poor. 
 Number two: a declining population,means scarce labor.,Scarce labor drives wages.,As wages increase,that also lifts the burden on the poor and the working class.,Now I'm not talking about a radical drop in population like we saw in the Black Death.,But look what happened in Europe,after the plague:,rising wages,,land reform,,technological innovation,,birth of the middle class;,and after that, forward-looking social movements,like the Renaissance,,and later the Enlightenment. 
 Most of our cultural heritage has tended to look backward,,romanticizing the past.,All of the Western religions begin with the notion of Eden,,and descend through a kind of profligate present,to a very ugly future.,So human history is viewed,as sort of this downhill slide,from the good old days. 
 But I think we're in for another change,,about two generations after the top of that curve,,once the effects of a declining population,start to settle in.,At that point, we'll start romanticizing the future again,,instead of the nasty, brutish past. 
 So why does this matter?,Why talk about social-economic movements,that may be more than a century away?,Because transitions are dangerous times.,When land owners start to lose money,,and labor demands more pay,,there are some powerful interests that are going to fear for the future.,Fear for the future leads to some rash decisions.,If we have a positive view about the future,then we may be able to accelerate through that turn,,instead of careening off a cliff. 
 If we can make it through the next 150 years,,I think that your great great grandchildren,will forget all about Malthus.,And instead, they'll be planning for the future,and starting to build the 22nd Century Enlightenment.,Thank you.,(Applause)Let me share with you today an original discovery.,But I want to tell it to you the way it really happened --,not the way I present it in a scientific meeting,,or the way you'd read it in a scientific paper.,It's a story about beyond biomimetics,,to something I'm calling biomutualism.,I define that as an association between biology and another discipline,,where each discipline reciprocally advances the other,,but where the collective discoveries that emerge are beyond any single field.,Now, in terms of biomimetics,,as human technologies take on more of the characteristics of nature,,nature becomes a much more useful teacher.,Engineering can be inspired by biology,by using its principles and analogies when they're advantageous,,but then integrating that with the best human engineering,,ultimately to make something actually better than nature. 
 Now, being a biologist, I was very curious about this.,These are gecko toes.,And we wondered how they use these bizarre toes,to climb up a wall so quickly.,We discovered it. And what we found was,that they have leaf-like structures on their toes,,with millions of tiny hairs that look like a rug,,and each of those hairs has the worst case of split-ends possible:,about 100 to 1000 split ends that are nano-size.,And the individual has 2 billion of these nano-size split ends.,They don't stick by Velcro or suction or glue.,They actually stick by intermolecular forces alone,,van der Waals forces.,And I'm really pleased to report to you today,that the first synthetic self-cleaning, dry adhesive has been made.,From the simplest version in nature, one branch,,my engineering collaborator, Ron Fearing, at Berkeley,,had made the first synthetic version.,And so has my other incredible collaborator,,Mark Cutkosky, at Stanford --,he made much larger hairs than the gecko,,but used the same general principles. 
 And here is its first test.,(Laughter),That's Kellar Autumn, my former Ph.D. student,,professor now at Lewis and Clark,,literally giving his first-born child up for this test.,(Laughter) 
 More recently, this happened. 
 Man: This the first time someone has actually climbed with it. 
 Narrator: Lynn Verinsky, a professional climber,,who appeared to be brimming with confidence. 
 Lynn Verinsky: Honestly, it's going to be perfectly safe. It will be perfectly safe. 
 Man: How do you know? 
 Lynn Verinsky: Because of liability insurance. (Laughter) 
 Narrator: With a mattress below and attached to a safety rope,,Lynn began her 60-foot ascent.,Lynn made it to the top in a perfect pairing,of Hollywood and science. 
 Man: So you're the first human being to officially emulate a gecko. 
 Lynn Verinsky: Ha! Wow. And what a privilege that has been. 
 Robert Full: That's what she did on rough surfaces.,But she actually used these on smooth surfaces --,two of them -- to climb up, and pull herself up.,And you can try this in the lobby,,and look at the gecko-inspired material.,Now the problem with the robots doing this,is that they can't get unstuck,,with the material.,This is the gecko's solution. They actually peel their toes away,from the surface, at high rates,,as they run up the wall. 
 Well I'm really excited today to show you,the newest version of a robot, Stickybot,,using a new hierarchical dry adhesive.,Here is the actual robot.,And here is what it does.,And if you look,,you can see that it uses,the toe peeling,,just like the gecko does.,If we can show some of the video, you can see it climbing up the wall.,(Applause),There it is.,And now it can go on other surfaces because of the new adhesive,that the Stanford group was able to do,in designing this incredible robot.,(Applause) 
 Oh. One thing I want to point out is, look at Stickybot.,You see something on it. It's not just to look like a gecko.,It has a tail. And just when you think you've figured out nature,,this kind of thing happens.,The engineers told us, for the climbing robots,,that, if they don't have a tail,,they fall off the wall.,So what they did was they asked us,an important question.,They said, "Well, it kind of looks like a tail.",Even though we put a passive bar there.,"Do animals use their tails when they climb up walls?",What they were doing was returning the favor,,by giving us a hypothesis to test,,in biology, that we wouldn't have thought of. 
 So of course, in reality, we were then panicked,,being the biologists, and we should know this already.,We said, "Well, what do tails do?",Well we know that tails store fat, for example.,We know that you can grab onto things with them.,And perhaps it is most well known,that they provide static balance.,(Laughter),It can also act as a counterbalance.,So watch this kangaroo.,See that tail? That's incredible!,Marc Raibert built a Uniroo hopping robot.,And it was unstable without its tail.,Now mostly tails limit maneuverability,,like this human inside this dinosaur suit.,(Laughter),My colleagues actually went on to test this limitation,,by increasing the moment of inertia of a student, so they had a tail,,and running them through and obstacle course,,and found a decrement in performance,,like you'd predict.,(Laughter),But of course, this is a passive tail.,And you can also have active tails. 
 And when I went back to research this, I realized,that one of the great TED moments in the past,,from Nathan,,we've talked about an active tail. 
 Video: Myhrvold thinks tail-cracking dinosaurs,were interested in love, not war. 
 Robert Full: He talked about the tail being a whip for communication.,It can also be used in defense.,Pretty powerful.,So we then went back and looked at the animal.,And we ran it up a surface.,But this time what we did is we put a slippery patch,that you see in yellow there.,And watch on the right what the animal is doing with its tail,when it slips. This is slowed down 10 times.,So here is normal speed.,And watch it now slip,,and see what it does with its tail.,It has an active tail that functions as a fifth leg,,and it contributes to stability.,If you make it slip a huge amount, this is what we discovered.,This is incredible.,The engineers had a really good idea. 
 And then of course we wondered,,okay, they have an active tail, but let's picture them.,They're climbing up a wall, or a tree.,And they get to the top and let's say there's some leaves there.,And what would happen if they climbed on the underside of that leaf,,and there was some wind, or we shook it?,And we did that experiment, that you see here.,(Applause),And this is what we discovered.,Now that's real time. You can't see anything.,But there it is slowed down. 
 What we discovered was the world's fastest air-righting response.,For those of you who remember your physics, that's a zero-angular-momentum,righting response. But it's like a cat.,You know, cats falling. Cats do this. They twist their bodies.,But geckos do it better.,And they do it with their tail.,So they do it with this active tail as they swing around.,And then they always land in the sort of superman skydiving posture.,Okay, now we wondered, if we were right,,we should be able to test this in a physical model, in a robot. 
 So for TED we actually built a robot,,over there, a prototype, with the tail.,And we're going to attempt the first air-righting response,in a tail, with a robot.,If we could have the lights on it.,Okay, there it goes.,And show the video.,There it is.,And it works just like it does in the animal.,So all you need is a swing of the tail to right yourself.,(Applause) 
 Now, of course, we were normally frightened,because the animal has no gliding adaptations,,so we thought, "Oh that's okay. We'll put it in a vertical wind tunnel.,We'll blow the air up, we'll give it a landing target, a tree trunk,,just outside the plexi-glass enclosure, and see what it does.,(Laughter),So we did. And here is what it does.,So the wind is coming from the bottom. This is slowed down 10 times.,It does an equilibrium glide. Highly controlled.,This is sort of incredible. But actually it's quite beautiful,,when you take a picture of it.,And it's better than that, it -- just in the slide -- maneuvers in mid-air.,And the way it does it, is it takes its tail,and it swings it one way to yaw left, and it swings its other way to yaw right.,So we can maneuver this way.,And then -- we had to film this several times to believe this --,it also does this. Watch this.,It oscillates its tail up and down like a dolphin.,It can actually swim through the air.,But watch its front legs. Can you see what they are doing?,What does that mean for the origin of flapping flight?,Maybe it's evolved from coming down from trees,,and trying to control a glide.,Stay tuned for that.,(Laughter) 
 So then we wondered, "Can they actually maneuver with this?",So there is the landing target. Could they steer towards it,with these capabilities? Here it is in the wind tunnel.,And it certainly looks like it.,You can see it even better from down on top.,Watch the animal.,Definitely moving towards the landing target.,Watch the whip of its tail as it does it. Look at that.,It's unbelievable. 
 So now we were really confused,,because there are no reports of it gliding.,So we went, "Oh my god, we have to go to the field,,and see if it actually does this.",Completely opposite of the way you'd see it on a nature film, of course.,We wondered, "Do they actually glide in nature?",Well we went to the forests of Singapore and Southeast Asia.,And the next video you see is the first time we've showed this. 
 This is the actual video -- not staged, a real research video --,of animal gliding down. There is a red trajectory line.,Look at the end to see the animal.,But then as it gets closer to the tree,,look at the close-up. And see if you can see it land.,So there it comes down. There is a gecko at the end of that trajectory line.,You see it there? There? Watch it come down.,Now watch up there and you can see the landing. Did you see it hit?,It actually uses its tail too,,just like we saw in the lab. 
 So now we can continue this mutualism,by suggesting that they can make an active tail.,And here is the first active tail, in the robot,,made by Boston Dynamics.,So to conclude, I think we need to build biomutualisms, like I showed,,that will increase the pace of basic discovery in their application.,To do this though, we need to redesign education in a major way,,to balance depth with interdisciplinary communication,,and explicitly train people how to contribute to, and benefit from other disciplines.,And of course you need the organisms and the environment to do it.,That is, whether you care about security, search and rescue or health,,we must preserve nature's designs,,otherwise these secrets will be lost forever.,And from what I heard from our new president,,I'm very optimistic. Thank you.,(Applause)I should tell you that when I was asked to be here,,I thought to myself that well, it's TED.,And these TEDsters are -- you know, as innocent as that name sounds --,these are the philanthropists and artists and scientists who sort of shape our world.,And what could I possibly have to say that would be distinguished enough,to justify my participation in something like that?,And so I thought perhaps a really civilized-sounding British accent,might help things a bit. 
 And then I thought no, no. I should just get up there and be myself,and just talk the way I really talk,because, after all, this is the great unveiling.,And so I thought I'd come up here and unveil my real voice to you.,Although many of you already know that I do speak the Queen's English,because I am from Queens, New York.,(Laughter),But the theme of this session, of course, is invention.,And while I don't have any patents that I'm aware of,,you will be meeting a few of my inventions today.,I suppose it's fair to say,that I am interested in the invention of self or selves.,We're all born into certain circumstances with particular physical traits,,unique developmental experiences, geographical and historical contexts.,But then what?,To what extent do we self-construct, do we self-invent?,How do we self-identify and how mutable is that identity?,Like, what if one could be anyone at any time?,Well my characters, like the ones in my shows,,allow me to play with the spaces between those questions.,And so I've brought a couple of them with me.,And well, they're very excited.,What I should tell you --,what I should tell you is that they've each prepared their own little TED talks.,So feel free to think of this as Sarah University.,(Laughter) 
 Okay. Okay. Oh, well.,Oh, wonderful.,Good evening everybody.,Thank you so very much for having me here today.,Ah, thank you very much. My name is Lorraine Levine.,Oh my! There's so many of you.,Hi sweetheart. Okay.,(Laughter),Anyway, I am here because of a young girl, Sarah Jones.,She's a very nice, young black girl.,Well you know, she calls herself black --,she's really more like a caramel color if you look at her.,But anyway.,(Laughter),She has me here because she puts me in her show,,what she calls her one-woman show.,And you know what that means, of course.,That means she takes the credit and then makes us come out here and do all the work.,But I don't mind. 
 Frankly, I'm kvelling just to be here,with all the luminaries you have attending something like this, you know.,Really, it's amazing.,Not only, of course, the scientists and all the wonderful giants of the industries,but the celebrities.,There are so many celebrities running around here.,I saw -- Glenn Close I saw earlier. I love her.,And she was getting a yogurt in the Google cafe.,Isn't that adorable?,(Laughter),So many others you see, they're just wonderful.,It's lovely to know they're concerned, you know.,And -- oh, I saw Goldie Hawn.,Oh, Goldie Hawn. I love her, too; she's wonderful. Yeah.,You know, she's only half Jewish.,Did you know that about her?,Yeah. But even so, a wonderful talent. (Laughter),And I -- you know, when I saw her, such a wonderful feeling.,Yeah, she's lovely.,But anyway, I should have started by saying just how lucky I feel.,It's such an eye-opening experience to be here.,You're all so responsible for this world that we live in today.,You know, I couldn't have dreamed of such a thing as a young girl.,And you've all made these advancements happen in such a short time --,you're all so young.,You know, your parents must be very proud. 
 But I -- I also appreciate the diversity that you have here.,I noticed it's very multicultural.,You know, when you're standing up here, you can see all the different people.,It's like a rainbow.,It's okay to say rainbow. Yeah.,I just -- I can't keep up with whether you can say, you know, the different things.,What are you allowed to say or not say?,I just -- I don't want to offend anybody. You know.,But anyway, you know,,I just think that to be here with all of you,accomplished young people --,literally, some of you, the architects building our brighter future.,You know, it's heartening to me.,Even though, quite frankly, some of your presentations are horrifying,,absolutely horrifying.,It's true. It's true.,You know, between the environmental degradation,and the crashing of the world markets you're talking about.,And of course, we know it's all because of the -- all the ...,Well, I don't know how else to say it to you, so I'll just say it my way:,the ganeyvish schticklich coming from the governments and the, you know,,the bankers and the Wall Street. You know it.,Anyway.,(Laughter) 
 The point is, I'm happy somebody has practical ideas,to get us out of this mess.,So I salute each of you and your stellar achievements.,Thank you for all that you do.,And congratulations on being such big makhers that you've become TED meisters.,So, happy continued success.,Congratulations. Mazel tov.,(Applause) 
 Hi. Hi.,Thank you everybody.,Sorry, this is such a wonderful opportunity and everything, to be here right now.,My name is Noraida. And I'm just --,I'm so thrilled to be part of like your TED conference,that you're doing and everything like that.,I am Dominican-American.,Actually, you could say I grew up in the capital of Dominican Republic,,otherwise known as Washington Heights in New York City.,But I don't know if there's any other Dominican people here,,but I know that Juan Enriquez, he was here yesterday.,And I think he's Mexican, so that's --,honestly, that's close enough for me right now. So --,(Laughter) 
 I just -- I'm sorry.,I'm just trying not to be nervous because this is,a very wonderful experience for me and everything.,And I just -- you know I'm not used to doing the public speaking.,And whenever I get nervous I start to talk really fast.,Nobody can understand nothing I'm saying, which is very frustrating for me,,as you can imagine.,I usually have to just like try to calm down and take a deep breath.,But then on top of that, you know, Sarah Jones told me we only have 18 minutes.,So then I'm like, should I be nervous, you know, because maybe it's better.,And I'm just trying not to panic and freak out. So I like, take a deep breath. 
 Okay. Sorry. So anyway, what I was trying to say is that I really love TED.,Like, I love everything about this. It's amazing.,Like, it's -- I can't get over this right now.,And, like, people would not believe, seriously, where I'm from,,that this even exists.,You know, like even, I mean I love like the name, the -- TED.,I mean I know it's a real person and everything, but I'm just saying that like,,you know, I think it's very cool how it's also an acronym, you know,,which is like, you know, is like very high concept and everything like that.,I like that. 
 And actually, I can relate to the whole like acronym thing and everything.,Because, actually, I'm a sophomore at college right now.,At my school -- actually I was part of co-founding an organization,,which is like a leadership thing,,you know, like you guys, you would really like it and everything.,And the organization is called DA BOMB,,Aand DA BOMB -- not like what you guys can build and everything --,it's like, DA BOMB, it means like Dominican -- it's an acronym --,Dominican-American Benevolent Organization for Mothers and Babies.,So, I know, see, like the name is like a little bit long,,but with the war on terror and everything,,the Dean of Student Activities has asked us to stop saying DA BOMB,and use the whole thing so nobody would get the wrong idea, whatever.,So, basically like DA BOMB --,what Dominican-American Benevolent Organization for Mothers and Babies does,is, basically, we try to advocate for students who show a lot of academic promise,and who also happen to be mothers like me.,I am a working mother, and I also go to school full-time.,And, you know, it's like -- it's so important to have like role models out there.,I mean, I know sometimes our lifestyles are very different, whatever. 
 But like even at my job -- like, I just got promoted.,Right now it's very exciting actually for me,because I'm the Junior Assistant to the Associate Director,under the Senior Vice President for Business Development --,that's my new title.,So, but I think whether you own your own company or you're just starting out like me,,like something like this is so vital,for people to just continue expanding their minds and learning.,And if everybody, like all people really had access to that,,it would be a very different world out there, as I know you know.,So, I think all people, we need that,,but especially, I look at people like me, you know like,,I mean, Latinos -- we're about to be the majority, in like two weeks.,So, we deserve just as much to be part of the exchange of ideas as everybody else.,So, I'm very happy that you're, you know, doing this kind of thing,,making the talks available online.,That's very good. I love that.,And I just -- I love you guys. I love TED.,And if you don't mind, privately now, in the future, I'm going to think of TED,as an acronym for Technology, Entertainment and Dominicans.,Thank you very much.,(Laughter),(Applause) 
 So, that was Noraida,,and just like Lorraine and everybody else you're meeting today,,these are folks who are based on real people from my real life:,friends, neighbors, family members.,I come from a multicultural family.,In fact, the older lady you just met:,very, very loosely based on a great aunt on my mother's side.,It's a long story, believe me.,But on top of my family background,,my parents also sent me to the United Nations school,,where I encountered a plethora of new characters,,including Alexandre, my French teacher, okay. 
 Well, you know, it was beginner French, that I am taking with her, you know.,And it was Madame Bousson, you know, she was very [French].,It was like, you know, she was there in the class,,you know, she was kind of typically French.,You know, she was very chic, but she was very filled with ennui, you know.,And she would be there, you know, kind of talking with the class, you know,,talking about the, you know, the existential futility of life, you know.,And we were only 11 years old, so it was not appropriate. (Laughter) 
 But [German].,Yes, I took German for three years, [German],,and it was quite the experience because I was the only black girl in the class,,even in the UN school.,Although, you know, it was wonderful.,The teacher, Herr Schtopf, he never discriminated.,Never. He always, always treated each of us,,you know, equally unbearably during the class. 
 So, there were the teachers and then there were my friends,,classmates from everywhere,,many of whom are still dear friends to this day.,And they've inspired many characters as well.,For example, a friend of mine. 
 Well, I just wanted to quickly say good evening.,My name is Praveen Manvi and thank you very much for this opportunity.,Of course, TED, the reputation precedes itself all over the world.,But, you know, I am originally from India,,and I wanted to start by telling you,that once Sarah Jones told me that we will be having the opportunity,to come here to TED in California,,originally, I was very pleased and, frankly, relieved,because, you know, I am a human rights advocate.,And usually my work, it takes me to Washington D.C.,And there, I must attend these meetings, mingling with some tiresome politicians,,trying to make me feel comfortable,by telling how often they are eating the curry in Georgetown. (Laughter),So, you can just imagine -- right.,So, but I'm thrilled to be joining all of you here.,I wish we had more time together, but that's for another time. Okay? Great.,(Applause) 
 And, sadly, I don't think we'll have time for you to meet everybody I brought, but --,I'm trying to behave myself,,it's my first time here.,But I do want to introduce you to a couple of folks you may recognize,,if you saw "Bridge and Tunnel." 
 Uh, well, thank you.,Good evening.,My name is Pauline Ning,,and first I want to tell you that I'm --,of course I am a member of the Chinese community in New York.,But when Sarah Jones asked me to please come to TED,,I said, well, you know, first, I don't know that, you know --,before two years ago, you would not find me in front of an audience of people,,much less like this,because I did not like to give speeches,because I feel that, as an immigrant, I do not have good English skills for speaking.,But then, I decided, just like Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger,,I try anyway.,(Laughter),My daughter -- my daughter wrote that,,she told me, "Always start your speech with humor." 
 But my background --,I want to tell you story only briefly.,My husband and I, we brought our son and daughter here in 1980s,to have the freedom we cannot have in China at that time.,And we tried to teach our kids to be proud of their tradition, but it's very hard.,You know, as immigrant, I would speak Chinese to them,,and they would always answer me back in English.,They love rock music, pop culture, American culture.,But when they got older,,when the time comes for them to start think about getting married,,that's when we expect them to realize, a little bit more, their own culture.,But that's where we had some problems.,My son, he says he is not ready to get married.,And he has a sweetheart, but she is American woman, not Chinese.,It's not that it's bad, but I told him, "What's wrong with a Chinese woman?",But I think he will change his mind soon. 
 So, then I decide instead, I will concentrate on my daughter.,The daughter's marriage is very special to the mom.,But first, she said she's not interested.,She only wants to spend time with her friends.,And then at college, it's like she never came home.,And she doesn't want me to come and visit.,So I said, "What's wrong in this picture?",So, I accused my daughter to have like a secret boyfriend.,But she told me, "Mom, you don't have to worry about boys,because I don't like them.",(Laughter),And I said, "Yes, men can be difficult, but all women have to get used to that.",She said, "No Mom. I mean, I don't like boys. I like girls.,I am lesbian.",So, I always teach my kids to respect American ideas,,but I told my daughter that this is one exception --,(Laughter) --,that she is not gay, she is just confused by this American problem.,But she told me, "Mom, it's not American.",She said she is in love -- in love with a nice Chinese girl.,(Laughter),So, these are the words I am waiting to hear,,but from my son, not my daughter.,(Laughter),But at first I did not know what to do.,But then, over time, I have come to understand that this is who she is. 
 So, even though sometimes it's still hard,,I will share with you that it helps me to realize,society is more tolerant, usually because of places like this,,because of ideas like this,,and people like you, with an open mind.,So I think maybe TED, you impact people's lives,in the ways maybe even you don't realize.,So, for my daughter's sake,,I thank you for your ideas worth spreading.,Thank you. Xie xie.,(Applause) 
 Good evening. My name is Habbi Belahal.,And I would like to first of all thank Sarah Jones,for putting all of the pressure on the only Arab who she brought with her,to be last today.,I am originally from Jordan.,And I teach comparative literature at Queens College.,It is not Harvard.,But I feel a bit like a fish out of water.,But I am very proud of my students.,And I see that a few of them did make it here to the conference.,So you will get the extra credit I promised you.,But, while I know that I may not look like the typical TED-izen, as you would say,,I do like to make the point that we in global society,,we are never as different as the appearances may suggest. 
 So, if you will indulge me, I will share quickly with you a bit of verse,,which I memorized as a young girl at 16 years of age.,So, back in the ancient times.,[Arabic],And this roughly translates:,"Please, let me hold your hand.,I want to hold your hand.,I want to hold your hand.,And when I touch you, I feel happy inside.,It's such a feeling that my love, I can't hide, I can't hide, I can't hide.",Well, so okay, but please, please, but please.,If it is sounding familiar, it is because I was at the same time in my life,listening to the Beatles.,On the radio [unclear], they were very popular. 
 So, all of that is to say that I like to believe,that for every word intended as to render us deaf to one another,,there is always a lyric connecting ears and hearts across the continents in rhyme.,And I pray that this is the way that we will self-invent, in time.,That's all, shukran. Thank you very much for the opportunity.,Okay? Great.,(Applause) 
 Thank you all very much. It was lovely.,Thank you for having me.,(Applause),Thank you very, very much. I love you.,(Applause),Well, you have to let me say this.,I just -- thank you.,I want to thank Chris and Jacqueline, and just everyone for having me here.,It's been a long time coming, and I feel like I'm home.,And I know I've performed for some of your companies,or some of you have seen me elsewhere,,but this is honestly one of the best audiences I've ever experienced.,The whole thing is amazing, and so don't you all go reinventing yourselves any time soon.,(Applause)We look around the media, as we see on the news from Iraq,,Afghanistan, Sierra Leone,,and the conflict seems incomprehensible to us.,And that's certainly how it seemed to me when I started this project.,But as a physicist,,I thought, well if you give me some data,,I could maybe understand this. You know, give us a go. 
 So as a naive New Zealander,I thought, well I'll go to the Pentagon.,Can you get me some information?,(Laughter),No. So I had to think a little harder.,And I was watching the news one night in Oxford.,And I looked down at the chattering heads on my channel of choice.,And I saw that there was information there.,There was data within the streams of news that we consume.,All this noise around us actually has information.,So what I started thinking was,,perhaps there is something like open source intelligence here.,If we can get enough of these streams of information together,,we can perhaps start to understand the war. 
 So this is exactly what I did. We started bringing a team together,,an interdisciplinary team of scientists,,of economists, mathematicians.,We brought these guys together and we started to try and solve this.,We did it in three steps.,The first step we did was to collect. We did 130 different sources of information --,from NGO reports to newspapers and cable news.,We brought this raw data in and we filtered it.,We extracted the key bits on information to build the database.,That database contained,the timing of attacks,,the location, the size and the weapons used.,It's all in the streams of information we consume daily,,we just have to know how to pull it out.,And once we had this we could start doing some cool stuff.,What if we were to look at the distribution of the sizes of attacks?,What would that tell us? 
 So we started doing this. And you can see here,on the horizontal axis,you've got the number of people killed in an attack,or the size of the attack.,And on the vertical axis you've got the number of attacks.,So we plot data for sample on this.,You see some sort of random distribution --,perhaps 67 attacks, one person was killed,,or 47 attacks where seven people were killed.,We did this exact same thing for Iraq.,And we didn't know, for Iraq what we were going to find.,It turns out what we found was pretty surprising.,You take all of the conflict,,all of the chaos, all of the noise,,and out of that,comes this precise mathematical distribution,of the way attacks are ordered in this conflict.,This blew our mind.,Why should a conflict like Iraq have this,as its fundamental signature?,Why should there be order in war?,We didn't really understand that.,We thought maybe there is something special about Iraq.,So we looked at a few more conflicts.,We looked at Colombia, we looked at Afghanistan,,and we looked at Senegal. 
 And the same pattern emerged in each conflict.,This wasn't supposed to happen.,These are different wars, with different religious factions,,different political factions, and different socioeconomic problems.,And yet the fundamental patterns underlying them,are the same.,So we went a little wider.,We looked around the world at all the data we could get our hands on.,From Peru to Indonesia,,we studied this same pattern again.,And we found that not only,were the distributions these straight lines,,but the slope of these lines, they clustered around,this value of alpha equals 2.5.,And we could generate an equation,that could predict the likelihood of an attack.,What we're saying here,is the probability of an attack killing X number of people,in a country like Iraq,is equal to a constant, times the size of that attack,,raised to the power of negative alpha.,And negative alpha is the slope of that line I showed you before. 
 So what?,This is data, statistics. What does it tell us about these conflicts?,That was a challenge we had to face as physicists.,How do we explain this?,And what we really found was that alpha,,if we think about it, is the organizational,structure of the insurgency.,Alpha is the distribution of the sizes of attacks,,which is really the distribution,of the group strength carrying out the attacks.,So we look at a process of group dynamics:,coalescence and fragmentation,,groups coming together, groups breaking apart.,And we start running the numbers on this. Can we simulate it?,Can we create the kind of patterns that we're seeing,in places like Iraq?,Turns out we kind of do a reasonable job.,We can run these simulations.,We can recreate this using a process of group dynamics,to explain the patterns that we see,all around the conflicts around the world. 
 So what's going on?,Why should these different -- seemingly different conflicts,have the same patterns?,Now what I believe is going on is that,the insurgent forces, they evolve over time. They adapt.,And it turns out there is only one solution,to fight a much stronger enemy.,And if you don't find that solution as an insurgent force,,you don't exist.,So every insurgent force that is ongoing,,every conflict that is ongoing,,it's going to look something like this.,And that is what we think is happening. 
 Taking it forward, how do we change it?,How do we end a war like Iraq?,What does it look like?,Alpha is the structure. It's got a stable state at 2.5.,This is what wars look like when they continue.,We've got to change that.,We can push it up:,the forces become more fragmented;,there is more of them, but they are weaker.,Or we push it down:,they're more robust; there is less groups;,but perhaps you can sit and talk to them. 
 So this graph here, I'm going to show you now.,No one has seen this before. This is literally,stuff that we've come through last week.,And we see the evolution of Alpha through time.,We see it start. And we see it grow up to the stable state,the wars around the world look like.,And it stays there through the invasion of Fallujah,until the Samarra bombings in the,Iraqi elections of '06.,And the system gets perturbed. It moves upwards,to a fragmented state.,This is when the surge happens.,And depending on who you ask,,the surge was supposed to push it up even further.,The opposite happened.,The groups became stronger.,They became more robust.,And so I'm thinking, right, great, it's going to keep going down.,We can talk to them. We can get a solution. The opposite happened.,It's moved up again. The groups are more fragmented.,And this tells me one of two things.,Either we're back where we started,and the surge has had no effect;,or finally the groups have been fragmented to the extent,that we can start to think about maybe moving out.,I don't know what the answer is to that.,But I know that we should be looking at the structure of the insurgency,to answer that question.,Thank you.,(Applause)So how would you run a whole country without oil?,That's the question that sort of hit me,in the middle of a Davos afternoon about four years ago.,It never left my brain.,And I started playing with it more like a puzzle.,The original thought I had: this must be ethanol.,So I went out and researched ethanol,,and found out you need the Amazon in your backyard in every country.,About six months later I figured out it must be hydrogen,,until some scientist told me the unfortunate truth,,which is, you actually use more,clean electrons than the ones you get,inside a car, if you use hydrogen.,So that is not going to be the path to go. 
 And then sort of through a process of,wandering around, I got to the thought,that actually if you could convert an entire country to electric cars,,in a way that is convenient and affordable,,you could get to a solution.,Now I started this from a point of view that,it has to be something that scales en masse.,Not how do you build one car,,but how do you scale this so that it can become,something that is used by 99 percent of the population?,The thought that came to mind is that it needs to be as good,as any car that you would have today.,So one, it has to be more convenient than a car.,And two, it has be more affordable than today's cars.,Affordable is not a 40,000 dollar sedan, right?,Alright? That's not something that we can finance or buy today.,And convenient is not something that you drive for an hour and charge for eight. 
 So we're bound with the laws of physics,and the laws of economics.,And so the thought that I started with was,how do you do this, still within the boundary,of the science we know today --,no time for science fair, no time for playing around with things,or waiting for the magic battery to show up.,How do you do it within the economics that we have today?,How do you do it from the power of the consumer up?,And not from the power of an edict down. 
 On a random visit to Tesla on some afternoon,,I actually found out that the answer comes,from separating between the car ownership,and the battery ownership.,In a sense if you want to think about it this is the classic,"batteries not included.",Now if you separate between the two,,you could actually answer the need for a convenient car,by creating a network,,by creating a network before the cars show up.,The network has two components in them.,First component is you charge the car whenever you stop --,ends up that cars are these strange beasts that drive,for about two hours and park for about 22 hours.,If you drive a car in the morning and drive it back in the afternoon,the ratio of charge to drive is about a minute for a minute.,And so the first thought that came to mind is,,everywhere we park we have electric power.,Now it sounds crazy. But in some places around the world,,like Scandinavia, you already have that.,If you park your car and didn't plug in the heater,,when you come back you don't have a car. It just doesn't work. 
 Now that last mile,,last foot, in a sense,,is the first step of the infrastructure.,The second step of the infrastructure needs to take care,of the range extension.,See we're bound by today's technology on batteries,,which is about 120 miles if you want to stay within,reasonable space and weight limitations.,120 miles is a good enough range for a lot of people.,But you never want to get stuck.,So what we added is a second element to our network,,which is a battery swap system.,You drive. You take your depleted battery out.,A full battery comes on. And you drive on.,You don't do it as a human being. You do it as a machine.,It looks like a car wash. You come into your car wash.,And a plate comes up, holds your battery, takes it out, puts it back in, and,within two minutes you're back on the road,and you can go again.,If you had charge spots everywhere,,and you had battery swap stations everywhere,,how often would you do it? And it ends up,that you'd do swapping less times than you stop at a gas station.,As a matter of fact, we added to the contract.,We said that if you stop to swap your battery more than 50 times a year,we start paying you money,because it's an inconvenience. 
 Then we looked at the question of the affordability.,We looked at the question, what happens when the battery is,disconnected from the car.,What is the cost of that battery?,Everybody tells us batteries are so expensive.,What we found out, when you move from molecules to electrons,,something interesting happens.,We can go back to the original economics of the car and look at it again.,The battery is not the gas tank, in a sense.,Remember in your car you have a gas tank.,You have the crude oil.,And you have refining and delivery of that crude oil,as what we call petrol or gasoline.,The battery in this sense, is the crude oil.,We have a battery bay. It costs the same hundred dollars,as the gas tank.,But the crude oil is replaced with a battery.,Just it doesn't burn. It consumes itself,step after step after step.,It has 2,000 life cycles these days.,And so it's sort of a mini well.,We were asked in the past when we bought an electric car,to pay for the entire well, for the life of the car.,Nobody wants to buy a mini well when they buy a car.,In a sense what we've done is,we've created a new consumable. 
 You, today, buy gasoline miles.,And we created electric miles.,And the price of electric miles ends up being a very interesting number.,Today 2010, in volume,,when we come to market, it is eight cents a mile.,Those of you who have a hard time calculating what that means --,in the average consumer,environment we're in in the U.S.,20 miles per gallon that's a buck 50, a buck 60 a gallon.,That's cheaper than today's gasoline, even in the U.S.,In Europe where taxes are in place,,that's the equivalent to a minus 60 dollar barrel.,But e-miles follow Moore's Law.,They go from eight cents a mile in 2010,,to four cents a mile in 2015,,to two cents a mile by 2020.,Why? Because batteries life cycle improve --,a bit of improvement on energy density, which reduces the price.,And these prices are actually with clean electrons.,We do not use any electrons that come from coal.,So in a sense this is,an absolute zero-carbon, zero-fossil fuel,electric mile at two cents a mile by 2020.,Now even if we get to 40 miles per gallon,by 2020, which is our desire.,Imagine only 40 miles per gallon cars would be on the road.,That is an 80 cent gallon.,An 80 cent gallon means, if the entire Pacific,would convert to crude oil,,and we'd let any oil company bring it out and refine it,,they still can't compete with two cents a mile.,That's a new economic factor,,which is fascinating to most people. 
 Now this would have been a wonderful paper.,That's how I solved it in my head. It was a white paper I handed out to governments.,And some governments told me that it's fascinating,that the younger generation actually thinks about these things.,(Laughter),Until I got to the,true young global leader, Shimon Peres, President of Israel,,and he ran a beautiful manipulation on me.,First he let me go to the prime minister of the country,,who told me, if you can find the money you need for this network,,200 million dollars,,and if you can find a car company,that will build that car in mass volume,,in two million cars -- that's what we needed in Israel --,I'll give you country to invest the 200 million into.,Peres thought that was a great idea. 
 So we went out, and we looked at all the car companies.,We sent letters to all the car companies.,Three of them never showed up. One of them asked us,if we would stay with hybrids and they would give us a discount.,But one of them Carlos Ghosn, CEO of Renault and Nissan,,when asked about hybrids said something very fascinating.,He said hybrids are like mermaids.,When you want a fish you get a woman and,when you need a woman you get a fish.,(Laughter),And Ghosn came up and said,,"I have the car, Mr. Peres; I will build you the cars.",And actually true to form, Renault has put a billion and a half dollars,in building nine different types of cars that fit this kind of model,that will come into the market in mass volume --,mass volume being the first year, 100 thousand cars.,It's the first mass-volume electric car,,zero-emission electric car in the market.,I was running, as Chris said,,to be the CEO of a large software company called SAP,And then Peres said, "Well won't you run this project?",And I said, "I'm ready for CEO" And he said,,"Oh no no no no no. You've got to explain to me,,what is more important than saving your country and saving the world,,that you would go and do?" 
 And I had to quit and come and do this thing called A Better Place.,We then decided to scale it up.,We went to other countries. As I said we went to Denmark.,And Denmark set this beautiful policy;,it's called the IQ test.,It's inversely proportional to taxes.,They put 180 percent tax on gasoline cars,and zero tax on zero-emission cars.,So if you want to buy a gasoline car in Denmark, it costs you about 60,000 Euros.,If you buy our car it's about 20,000 Euros.,If you fail the IQ test they ask you to leave the country.,(Laughter) 
 We then were sort of coined as the guys,who run only in small islands.,I know most people don't think of Israel as a small island,,but Israel is an island -- it's a transportation island.,If your car is driving outside Israel it's been stolen.,(Laughter),If you're thinking about it in terms of islands,,we decided to go to the biggest island that we could find,,and that was Australia. The third country we announced was Australia.,It's got three centers --,in Brisbane, in Melbourne, in Sydney --,and one freeway, one electric freeway that connects them.,The next island,was not too hard to find, and that was Hawaii.,We decided to come into the U.S.,and pick the two best places --,the one where you didn't need any range extension.,Hawaii you can drive around the island on one battery.,And if you really have a long day you can switch,,and keep on driving around the island. 
 The second one was the San Francisco Bay Area,where Gavin Newsom created a beautiful policy across all the mayors.,He decided that he's going to take over,the state, unofficially, and then officially,,and then created this beautiful Region One policy.,In the San Francisco Bay Area not only do you have,the highest concentration of Priuses,,but you also have the perfect range extender.,It's called the other car.,As we stared scaling it up,we looked at what is the problem to come up to the U.S.?,Why is this a big issue?,And the most fascinating thing we've learned is that,,when you have small problems on the individual level,,like the price of gasoline to drive every morning.,You don't notice it, but when the aggregate comes up,you're dead. Alright? 
 So the price of oil, much like,lots of other curves that we've seen,,goes along a depletion curve.,The foundation of this curve is that we keep losing the wells that are close to the ground.,And we keep getting wells that are farther away from the ground.,It becomes more and more and more expensive to dig them out.,You think, well it's been up, it's been down,,its been up, it's going to keep on going up and down.,Here is the problem:,at 147 dollars a barrel, which we were in six months ago,,the U.S. spent a ton of money to get oil.,Then we lost our economy and we went back down to 47 --,sometimes it's 40, sometimes it's 50.,Now we're running a stimulus package.,It's called the trillion-dollar stimulus package.,We're going to revive the economy. Hopefully it happens between now and 2015,,somewhere in that space.,What happens when the economy recovers?,By 2015 we would have had at least 250 million new cars,even at the pace we're going at right now.,That's another 30 percent demand on oil.,That is another 25 million barrels a day.,That's all the U.S. usage today.,In other words at some point when we've recovered we go up to the peak.,And then we do the OPEC stimulus package,also known as 200 dollars a barrel.,We take our money and we give it away.,You know what happens at that point?,We go back down. It's going to go up and down.,And the downs are going to be much longer,and the ups are going to be much shorter. 
 And that's the difference between problems that are additive,,like CO2, which we go slowly up and then we tip,,and problems that are depletive,,in which we lose what we have,,which oscillate, and they oscillate until,we lose everything we've got.,Now we actually looked at what the answer would be.,Right? Remember in the campaign: one million,hybrid cars by 2015.,That is 0.5 percent of the U.S. oil consumption.,That is oh point oh well percent of the rest of the world.,That won't do much difference. 
 We looked at an MIT study:,ten million electric cars on the global roads.,Ten million out of 500 million we will add between now and then.,That is the most pessimistic number you can have.,It's also the most optimistic number,because it means we will scale this industry,from 100 thousand cars is 2011,,to 10 million cars by 2016 --,100 x growth in less than five years.,You have to remember that the world today is bringing in so many cars.,We have 10 million cars by region.,That's an enormous amount of cars. 
 China is adding those cars --,India, Russia, Brazil.,We have all these regions.,Europe has solved it. They just put a tax on gasoline.,They'll be the first in line to get off,because their prices are high.,China solves it by an edict. At some point they'll just declare,that no gasoline car will come into a city, and that will be it.,The Indians don't even understand why we think of it as a problem,because most people in India fill two or three gallons every time.,For them to get a battery that goes 120 miles,is an extension on range, not a reduction in range.,We're the only ones who don't have the price set right.,We don't have the industry set right.,We don't have any incentive to go and resolve it,across the U.S. 
 Now where is the car industry on that?,Very interesting. The car industry has been focused just on themselves.,They basically looked at it and said, "Car 1.0,we'll solve everything within the car itself.",No infrastructure, no problem.,We forgot about the entire chain around us.,All this stuff that happens around.,We are looking at the emergence of a car 2.0 --,a whole new market, a whole new business model.,The business model in which the money that is actually coming in,,to drive the car --,the minutes, the miles if you want,,that you are all familiar with --,subsidize the price of the car,,just like cellphones. You'll pay for the miles.,And some of it will go back to the car maker.,Some of it will go back to your own pocket.,But our cars are actually going to be cheaper than gasoline cars. 
 You're looking at a world where cars are matched with windmills.,In Denmark, we will drive all the cars in Denmark,from windmills, not from oil.,In Israel, we've asked to put a solar farm,in the south of Israel.,And people said, "Oh that's a very very large space that you're asking for.",And we said, "What if we had proven that in the same space,we found oil for the country for the next hundred years?",And they said, "We tried. There isn't any.",We said, "No no, but what if we prove it?",And they said, "Well you can dig." And we decided to dig up,,instead of digging down.,These are perfect matches to one another. 
 Now all you need is about 10 percent,of the electricity generated.,Think of it as a project that spans over about 10 years.,That's one percent a year.,Now when we're looking at solving big problems,,we need to start thinking in two numbers.,And those are not 20 percent by 2020.,The two numbers are zero -- as in zero footprint or zero oil --,and scale it infinity.,And when we go to COP15 at the end of this year,we can't stop thinking of padding CO2.,We have to start thinking about giving kickers to countries,that are willing to go to this kind of scale. 
 One car emits four tons.,And actually 700 and change million cars today,emit 2.8 billion tons of CO2.,That's, in the additive, about 25 percent of our problem.,Cars and trucks add up to about 25 percent of the world's CO2 emissions.,We have to come and attack this problem,with a focus, with an effort that actually says,,we're going to go to zero before the world ends.,I actually shared that with some legislators here in the U.S.,I shared it with a gentleman called Bobby Kennedy Jr., who is one of my idols.,I told him one of the reasons that,his uncle was remembered,is because he said we're going to send a man to the moon,,and we'll do it by the end of the decade.,We didn't say we're going to send a man 20 percent to the moon.,And there will be about a 20 percent chance we'll recover him.,(Laughter) 
 He actually shared with me another story, which is from about 200 years ago.,200 years ago, in Parliament, in Great Britain,,there was a long argument,over economy versus morality.,25 percent -- just like 25 percent emissions today comes from cars --,25 percent of their energy,for the entire industrial world in the U.K.,came from a source of energy that was immoral:,human slaves.,And there was an argument. Should we stop using slaves?,And what would it do to our economy?,And people said, "Well we need to take time to do it.,Let's not do it immediately. Maybe we free the kids,and keep the slaves.,And after a month of arguments they decided to stop slavery,,and the industrial revolution started within less than one year.,And the U.K. had 100 years of economic growth.,We have to make the right moral decision.,We have to make it immediately.,We need to have presidential leadership,just like we had in Israel that said we will end oil.,And we need to do it not within 20 years or 50 years,,but within this presidential term,because if we don't, we will lose our economy,,right after we'd lost our morality. 
 Thank you all very much.,(Applause)Fifty years ago, when I began exploring the ocean,,no one -- not Jacques Perrin, not Jacques Cousteau or Rachel Carson --,imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean,by what we put into it or by what we took out of it.,It seemed, at that time, to be a sea of Eden,,but now we know, and now we are facing paradise lost. 
 I want to share with you,my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us,,and to consider why it matters that in 50 years, we've lost --,actually, we've taken, we've eaten --,more than 90 percent of the big fish in the sea;,why you should care that nearly half of the coral reefs have disappeared;,why a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large areas of the Pacific,should concern not only the creatures that are dying,,but it really should concern you.,It does concern you, as well. 
 I'm haunted by the thought of what Ray Anderson calls "tomorrow's child,",asking why we didn't do something on our watch,to save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and the living ocean,while there still was time.,Well, now is that time.,I hope for your help,to explore and protect the wild ocean,in ways that will restore the health and,,in so doing, secure hope for humankind.,Health to the ocean means health for us. 
 And I hope Jill Tarter's wish to engage Earthlings includes dolphins and whales,and other sea creatures,in this quest to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe.,And I hope, Jill, that someday,we will find evidence that there is intelligent life among humans on this planet. 
 (Laughter) 
 Did I say that? I guess I did. 
 For me, as a scientist,,it all began in 1953,when I first tried scuba.,It's when I first got to know fish swimming,in something other than lemon slices and butter.,I actually love diving at night;,you see a lot of fish then that you don't see in the daytime.,Diving day and night was really easy for me in 1970,,when I led a team of aquanauts living underwater for weeks at a time --,at the same time that astronauts were putting their footprints on the moon.,In 1979 I had a chance to put my footprints on the ocean floor,while using this personal submersible called Jim.,It was six miles offshore and 1,250 feet down.,It's one of my favorite bathing suits. 
 Since then, I've used about 30 kinds of submarines,and I've started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called Deep Search,to design and build systems,to access the deep sea.,I led a five-year National Geographic expedition,,the Sustainable Seas expeditions,,using these little subs.,They're so simple to drive that even a scientist can do it.,And I'm living proof.,Astronauts and aquanauts alike,really appreciate the importance of air, food, water, temperature --,all the things you need to stay alive in space or under the sea.,I heard astronaut Joe Allen explain,how he had to learn everything he could about his life support system,and then do everything he could,to take care of his life support system;,and then he pointed to this and he said, "Life support system.",We need to learn everything we can about it,and do everything we can to take care of it. 
 The poet Auden said, "Thousands have lived without love;,none without water.",Ninety-seven percent of Earth's water is ocean.,No blue, no green.,If you think the ocean isn't important,,imagine Earth without it.,Mars comes to mind.,No ocean, no life support system.,I gave a talk not so long ago at the World Bank,and I showed this amazing image of Earth,and I said, "There it is! The World Bank!",That's where all the assets are!,And we've been trawling them down,much faster than the natural systems can replenish them. 
 Tim Worth says the economy is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the environment.,With every drop of water you drink,,every breath you take,,you're connected to the sea.,No matter where on Earth you live.,Most of the oxygen in the atmosphere is generated by the sea.,Over time, most of the planet's organic carbon,has been absorbed and stored there,,mostly by microbes.,The ocean drives climate and weather,,stabilizes temperature, shapes Earth's chemistry.,Water from the sea forms clouds,that return to the land and the seas,as rain, sleet and snow,,and provides home for about 97 percent of life in the world,,maybe in the universe.,No water, no life;,no blue, no green. 
 Yet we have this idea, we humans,,that the Earth -- all of it: the oceans, the skies --,are so vast and so resilient,it doesn't matter what we do to it.,That may have been true 10,000 years ago,,and maybe even 1,000 years ago,but in the last 100, especially in the last 50,,we've drawn down the assets,,the air, the water, the wildlife,that make our lives possible.,New technologies are helping us to understand,the nature of nature;,the nature of what's happening,,showing us our impact on the Earth.,I mean, first you have to know that you've got a problem.,And fortunately, in our time,,we've learned more about the problems than in all preceding history.,And with knowing comes caring.,And with caring, there's hope,that we can find an enduring place for ourselves,within the natural systems that support us.,But first we have to know. 
 Three years ago, I met John Hanke,,who's the head of Google Earth,,and I told him how much I loved being able to hold the world in my hands,and go exploring vicariously.,But I asked him: "When are you going to finish it?,You did a great job with the land, the dirt.,What about the water?",Since then, I've had the great pleasure of working with the Googlers,,with DOER Marine, with National Geographic,,with dozens of the best institutions and scientists around the world,,ones that we could enlist,,to put the ocean in Google Earth.,And as of just this week, last Monday,,Google Earth is now whole. 
 Consider this: Starting right here at the convention center,,we can find the nearby aquarium,,we can look at where we're sitting,,and then we can cruise up the coast to the big aquarium, the ocean,,and California's four national marine sanctuaries,,and the new network of state marine reserves,that are beginning to protect and restore some of the assets,We can flit over to Hawaii,and see the real Hawaiian Islands:,not just the little bit that pokes through the surface,,but also what's below.,To see -- wait a minute, we can go kshhplash! --,right there, ha --,under the ocean, see what the whales see.,We can go explore the other side of the Hawaiian Islands.,We can go actually and swim around on Google Earth,and visit with humpback whales.,These are the gentle giants that I've had the pleasure of meeting face to face,many times underwater.,There's nothing quite like being personally inspected by a whale. 
 We can pick up and fly to the deepest place:,seven miles down, the Mariana Trench,,where only two people have ever been.,Imagine that. It's only seven miles,,but only two people have been there, 49 years ago.,One-way trips are easy.,We need new deep-diving submarines.,How about some X Prizes for ocean exploration?,We need to see deep trenches, the undersea mountains,,and understand life in the deep sea. 
 We can now go to the Arctic.,Just ten years ago I stood on the ice at the North Pole.,An ice-free Arctic Ocean may happen in this century.,That's bad news for the polar bears.,That's bad news for us too.,Excess carbon dioxide is not only driving global warming,,it's also changing ocean chemistry,,making the sea more acidic.,That's bad news for coral reefs and oxygen-producing plankton.,Also it's bad news for us.,We're putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic,and other trash into the sea.,Millions of tons of discarded fishing nets,,gear that continues to kill.,We're clogging the ocean, poisoning the planet's circulatory system,,and we're taking out hundreds of millions of tons of wildlife,,all carbon-based units.,Barbarically, we're killing sharks for shark fin soup,,undermining food chains that shape planetary chemistry,and drive the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle,,the oxygen cycle, the water cycle --,our life support system.,We're still killing bluefin tuna; truly endangered,and much more valuable alive than dead.,All of these parts are part of our life support system.,We kill using long lines, with baited hooks every few feet,that may stretch for 50 miles or more.,Industrial trawlers and draggers are scraping the sea floor,like bulldozers, taking everything in their path. 
 Using Google Earth you can witness trawlers --,in China, the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico --,shaking the foundation of our life support system,,leaving plumes of death in their path.,The next time you dine on sushi -- or sashimi,,or swordfish steak, or shrimp cocktail,,whatever wildlife you happen to enjoy from the ocean --,think of the real cost.,For every pound that goes to market,,more than 10 pounds, even 100 pounds,,may be thrown away as bycatch.,This is the consequence of not knowing,that there are limits to what we can take out of the sea.,This chart shows the decline in ocean wildlife,from 1900 to 2000.,The highest concentrations are in red.,In my lifetime, imagine,,90 percent of the big fish have been killed.,Most of the turtles, sharks, tunas and whales,are way down in numbers. 
 But, there is good news.,Ten percent of the big fish still remain.,There are still some blue whales.,There are still some krill in Antarctica.,There are a few oysters in Chesapeake Bay.,Half the coral reefs are still in pretty good shape,,a jeweled belt around the middle of the planet.,There's still time, but not a lot,,to turn things around.,But business as usual means that in 50 years,,there may be no coral reefs --,and no commercial fishing, because the fish will simply be gone.,Imagine the ocean without fish.,Imagine what that means to our life support system.,Natural systems on the land are in big trouble too,,but the problems are more obvious,,and some actions are being taken to protect trees, watersheds and wildlife. 
 And in 1872, with Yellowstone National Park,,the United States began establishing a system of parks,that some say was the best idea America ever had.,About 12 percent of the land around the world is now protected:,safeguarding biodiversity, providing a carbon sink,,generating oxygen, protecting watersheds.,And, in 1972, this nation began to establish a counterpart in the sea,,National Marine Sanctuaries.,That's another great idea.,The good news is,that there are now more than 4,000 places in the sea, around the world,,that have some kind of protection.,And you can find them on Google Earth.,The bad news is,that you have to look hard to find them.,In the last three years, for example,,the U.S. protected 340,000 square miles of ocean as national monuments.,But it only increased from 0.6 of one percent,to 0.8 of one percent of the ocean protected, globally.,Protected areas do rebound,,but it takes a long time to restore,50-year-old rockfish or monkfish, sharks or sea bass,,or 200-year-old orange roughy.,We don't consume 200-year-old cows or chickens.,Protected areas provide hope,that the creatures of Ed Wilson's dream,of an encyclopedia of life, or the census of marine life,,will live not just as a list,,a photograph, or a paragraph. 
 With scientists around the world, I've been looking at the 99 percent of the ocean,that is open to fishing -- and mining, and drilling, and dumping, and whatever --,to search out hope spots,,and try to find ways to give them and us a secure future.,Such as the Arctic --,we have one chance, right now, to get it right.,Or the Antarctic, where the continent is protected,,but the surrounding ocean is being stripped of its krill, whales and fish.,Sargasso Sea's three million square miles of floating forest,is being gathered up to feed cows.,97 percent of the land in the Galapagos Islands is protected,,but the adjacent sea is being ravaged by fishing.,It's true too in Argentina,on the Patagonian shelf, which is now in serious trouble.,The high seas, where whales, tuna and dolphins travel --,the largest, least protected, ecosystem on Earth,,filled with luminous creatures,,living in dark waters that average two miles deep.,They flash, and sparkle, and glow,with their own living light. 
 There are still places in the sea as pristine as I knew as a child.,The next 10 years may be the most important,,and the next 10,000 years the best chance our species will have,to protect what remains of the natural systems that give us life.,To cope with climate change, we need new ways to generate power.,We need new ways, better ways, to cope with poverty, wars and disease.,We need many things to keep and maintain the world as a better place.,But, nothing else will matter,if we fail to protect the ocean.,Our fate and the ocean's are one.,We need to do for the ocean what Al Gore did for the skies above. 
 A global plan of action,with a world conservation union, the IUCN,,is underway to protect biodiversity,,to mitigate and recover from the impacts of climate change,,on the high seas and in coastal areas,,wherever we can identify critical places.,New technologies are needed to map, photograph and explore,the 95 percent of the ocean that we have yet to see.,The goal is to protect biodiversity,,to provide stability and resilience.,We need deep-diving subs,,new technologies to explore the ocean.,We need, maybe, an expedition --,a TED at sea --,that could help figure out the next steps. 
 And so, I suppose you want to know what my wish is.,I wish you would use all means at your disposal --,films, expeditions, the web, new submarines --,and campaign to ignite public support,for a global network of marine protected areas --,hope spots large enough to save and restore the ocean,,the blue heart of the planet.,How much?,Some say 10 percent, some say 30 percent.,You decide: how much of your heart do you want to protect?,Whatever it is,,a fraction of one percent is not enough.,My wish is a big wish,,but if we can make it happen, it can truly change the world,,and help ensure the survival,of what actually -- as it turns out -- is my favorite species;,that would be us.,For the children of today,,for tomorrow's child:,as never again, now is the time. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Time flies.,It's actually almost 20 years ago,when I wanted to reframe the way we use information,,the way we work together: I invented the World Wide Web.,Now, 20 years on, at TED,,I want to ask your help in a new reframing. 
 So going back to 1989,,I wrote a memo suggesting the global hypertext system.,Nobody really did anything with it, pretty much.,But 18 months later -- this is how innovation happens --,18 months later, my boss said I could do it on the side,,as a sort of a play project,,kick the tires of a new computer we'd got.,And so he gave me the time to code it up.,So I basically roughed out what HTML should look like:,hypertext protocol, HTTP;,the idea of URLs, these names for things,which started with HTTP.,I wrote the code and put it out there. 
 Why did I do it?,Well, it was basically frustration.,I was frustrated -- I was working as a software engineer,in this huge, very exciting lab,,lots of people coming from all over the world.,They brought all sorts of different computers with them.,They had all sorts of different data formats,,all sorts, all kinds of documentation systems.,So that, in all that diversity,,if I wanted to figure out how to build something,out of a bit of this and a bit of this,,everything I looked into, I had to connect to some new machine,,I had to learn to run some new program,,I would find the information I wanted in some new data format.,And these were all incompatible.,It was just very frustrating.,The frustration was all this unlocked potential. 
 In fact, on all these discs there were documents.,So if you just imagined them all,being part of some big, virtual documentation system in the sky,,say on the Internet,,then life would be so much easier.,Well, once you've had an idea like that it kind of gets under your skin,and even if people don't read your memo --,actually he did, it was found after he died, his copy.,He had written, "Vague, but exciting," in pencil, in the corner. 
 (Laughter) 
 But in general it was difficult -- it was really difficult to explain,what the web was like.,It's difficult to explain to people now that it was difficult then.,But then -- OK, when TED started, there was no web,so things like "click" didn't have the same meaning.,I can show somebody a piece of hypertext,,a page which has got links,,and we click on the link and bing -- there'll be another hypertext page.,Not impressive.,You know, we've seen that -- we've got things on hypertext on CD-ROMs.,What was difficult was to get them to imagine:,so, imagine that that link could have gone,to virtually any document you could imagine.,Alright, that is the leap that was very difficult for people to make.,Well, some people did.,So yeah, it was difficult to explain, but there was a grassroots movement.,And that is what has made it most fun.,That has been the most exciting thing,,not the technology, not the things people have done with it,,but actually the community, the spirit of all these people,getting together, sending the emails.,That's what it was like then. 
 Do you know what? It's funny, but right now it's kind of like that again.,I asked everybody, more or less, to put their documents --,I said, "Could you put your documents on this web thing?",And you did.,Thanks.,It's been a blast, hasn't it?,I mean, it has been quite interesting,because we've found out that the things that happen with the web,really sort of blow us away.,They're much more than we'd originally imagined,when we put together the little, initial website,that we started off with.,Now, I want you to put your data on the web.,Turns out that there is still huge unlocked potential.,There is still a huge frustration,that people have because we haven't got data on the web as data. 
 What do you mean, "data"? What's the difference -- documents, data?,Well, documents you read, OK?,More or less, you read them, you can follow links from them, and that's it.,Data -- you can do all kinds of stuff with a computer.,Who was here or has otherwise seen Hans Rosling's talk?,One of the great -- yes a lot of people have seen it --,one of the great TED Talks.,Hans put up this presentation,in which he showed, for various different countries, in various different colors --,he showed income levels on one axis,and he showed infant mortality, and he shot this thing animated through time.,So, he'd taken this data and made a presentation,which just shattered a lot of myths that people had,about the economics in the developing world. 
 He put up a slide a little bit like this.,It had underground all the data,OK, data is brown and boxy and boring,,and that's how we think of it, isn't it?,Because data you can't naturally use by itself,But in fact, data drives a huge amount of what happens in our lives,and it happens because somebody takes that data and does something with it.,In this case, Hans had put the data together,he had found from all kinds of United Nations websites and things.,He had put it together,,combined it into something more interesting than the original pieces,and then he'd put it into this software,,which I think his son developed, originally,,and produces this wonderful presentation.,And Hans made a point,of saying, "Look, it's really important to have a lot of data.",And I was happy to see that at the party last night,that he was still saying, very forcibly, "It's really important to have a lot of data." 
 So I want us now to think about,not just two pieces of data being connected, or six like he did,,but I want to think about a world where everybody has put data on the web,and so virtually everything you can imagine is on the web,and then calling that linked data.,The technology is linked data, and it's extremely simple.,If you want to put something on the web there are three rules:,first thing is that those HTTP names --,those things that start with "http:" --,we're using them not just for documents now,,we're using them for things that the documents are about.,We're using them for people, we're using them for places,,we're using them for your products, we're using them for events.,All kinds of conceptual things, they have names now that start with HTTP. 
 Second rule, if I take one of these HTTP names and I look it up,and I do the web thing with it and I fetch the data,using the HTTP protocol from the web,,I will get back some data in a standard format,which is kind of useful data that somebody might like to know,about that thing, about that event.,Who's at the event? Whatever it is about that person,,where they were born, things like that.,So the second rule is I get important information back. 
 Third rule is that when I get back that information,it's not just got somebody's height and weight and when they were born,,it's got relationships.,Data is relationships.,Interestingly, data is relationships.,This person was born in Berlin; Berlin is in Germany.,And when it has relationships, whenever it expresses a relationship,then the other thing that it's related to,is given one of those names that starts HTTP.,So, I can go ahead and look that thing up.,So I look up a person -- I can look up then the city where they were born; then,I can look up the region it's in, and the town it's in,,and the population of it, and so on.,So I can browse this stuff. 
 So that's it, really.,That is linked data.,I wrote an article entitled "Linked Data" a couple of years ago,and soon after that, things started to happen.,The idea of linked data is that we get lots and lots and lots,of these boxes that Hans had,,and we get lots and lots and lots of things sprouting.,It's not just a whole lot of other plants.,It's not just a root supplying a plant,,but for each of those plants, whatever it is --,a presentation, an analysis, somebody's looking for patterns in the data --,they get to look at all the data,and they get it connected together,,and the really important thing about data,is the more things you have to connect together, the more powerful it is. 
 So, linked data.,The meme went out there.,And, pretty soon Chris Bizer at the Freie Universitat in Berlin,who was one of the first people to put interesting things up,,he noticed that Wikipedia --,you know Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia,with lots and lots of interesting documents in it.,Well, in those documents, there are little squares, little boxes.,And in most information boxes, there's data.,So he wrote a program to take the data, extract it from Wikipedia,,and put it into a blob of linked data,on the web, which he called dbpedia.,Dbpedia is represented by the blue blob in the middle of this slide,and if you actually go and look up Berlin,,you'll find that there are other blobs of data,which also have stuff about Berlin, and they're linked together.,So if you pull the data from dbpedia about Berlin,,you'll end up pulling up these other things as well.,And the exciting thing is it's starting to grow.,This is just the grassroots stuff again, OK? 
 Let's think about data for a bit.,Data comes in fact in lots and lots of different forms.,Think of the diversity of the web. It's a really important thing,that the web allows you to put all kinds of data up there.,So it is with data. I could talk about all kinds of data.,We could talk about government data, enterprise data is really important,,there's scientific data, there's personal data,,there's weather data, there's data about events,,there's data about talks, and there's news and there's all kinds of stuff.,I'm just going to mention a few of them,so that you get the idea of the diversity of it,,so that you also see how much unlocked potential. 
 Let's start with government data.,Barack Obama said in a speech,,that he -- American government data would be available on the Internet,in accessible formats.,And I hope that they will put it up as linked data.,That's important. Why is it important?,Not just for transparency, yeah transparency in government is important,,but that data -- this is the data from all the government departments,Think about how much of that data is about how life is lived in America.,It's actual useful. It's got value.,I can use it in my company.,I could use it as a kid to do my homework.,So we're talking about making the place, making the world run better,by making this data available. 
 In fact if you're responsible -- if you know about some data,in a government department, often you find that,these people, they're very tempted to keep it --,Hans calls it database hugging.,You hug your database, you don't want to let it go,until you've made a beautiful website for it.,Well, I'd like to suggest that rather --,yes, make a beautiful website,,who am I to say don't make a beautiful website?,Make a beautiful website, but first,give us the unadulterated data,,we want the data.,We want unadulterated data.,OK, we have to ask for raw data now.,And I'm going to ask you to practice that, OK?,Can you say "raw"? 
 Audience: Raw. 
 Tim Berners-Lee: Can you say "data"? 
 Audience: Data. 
 TBL: Can you say "now"? 
 Audience: Now! 
 TBL: Alright, "raw data now"! 
 Audience: Raw data now! 
 Practice that. It's important because you have no idea the number of excuses,people come up with to hang onto their data,and not give it to you, even though you've paid for it as a taxpayer.,And it's not just America. It's all over the world.,And it's not just governments, of course -- it's enterprises as well. 
 So I'm just going to mention a few other thoughts on data.,Here we are at TED, and all the time we are very conscious,of the huge challenges that human society has right now --,curing cancer, understanding the brain for Alzheimer's,,understanding the economy to make it a little bit more stable,,understanding how the world works.,The people who are going to solve those -- the scientists --,they have half-formed ideas in their head,,they try to communicate those over the web.,But a lot of the state of knowledge of the human race at the moment,is on databases, often sitting in their computers,,and actually, currently not shared. 
 In fact, I'll just go into one area --,if you're looking at Alzheimer's, for example,,drug discovery -- there is a whole lot of linked data which is just coming out,because scientists in that field realize,this is a great way of getting out of those silos,,because they had their genomics data in one database,in one building, and they had their protein data in another.,Now, they are sticking it onto -- linked data --,and now they can ask the sort of question, that you probably wouldn't ask,,I wouldn't ask -- they would.,What proteins are involved in signal transduction,and also related to pyramidal neurons?,Well, you take that mouthful and you put it into Google.,Of course, there's no page on the web which has answered that question,because nobody has asked that question before.,You get 223,000 hits --,no results you can use.,You ask the linked data -- which they've now put together --,32 hits, each of which is a protein which has those properties,and you can look at.,The power of being able to ask those questions, as a scientist --,questions which actually bridge across different disciplines --,is really a complete sea change.,It's very very important.,Scientists are totally stymied at the moment --,the power of the data that other scientists have collected is locked up,and we need to get it unlocked so we can tackle those huge problems. 
 Now if I go on like this, you'll think that all the data comes from huge institutions,and has nothing to do with you.,But, that's not true.,In fact, data is about our lives.,You just -- you log on to your social networking site,,your favorite one, you say, "This is my friend.",Bing! Relationship. Data.,You say, "This photograph, it's about -- it depicts this person. ",Bing! That's data. Data, data, data.,Every time you do things on the social networking site,,the social networking site is taking data and using it -- re-purposing it --,and using it to make other people's lives more interesting on the site.,But, when you go to another linked data site --,and let's say this is one about travel,,and you say, "I want to send this photo to all the people in that group,",you can't get over the walls.,The Economist wrote an article about it, and lots of people have blogged about it --,tremendous frustration.,The way to break down the silos is to get inter-operability,between social networking sites.,We need to do that with linked data. 
 One last type of data I'll talk about, maybe it's the most exciting.,Before I came down here, I looked it up on OpenStreetMap,The OpenStreetMap's a map, but it's also a Wiki.,Zoom in and that square thing is a theater -- which we're in right now --,The Terrace Theater. It didn't have a name on it.,So I could go into edit mode, I could select the theater,,I could add down at the bottom the name, and I could save it back.,And now if you go back to the OpenStreetMap. org,,and you find this place, you will find that The Terrace Theater has got a name.,I did that. Me!,I did that to the map. I just did that!,I put that up on there. Hey, you know what?,If I -- that street map is all about everybody doing their bit,and it creates an incredible resource,because everybody else does theirs.,And that is what linked data is all about.,It's about people doing their bit,to produce a little bit, and it all connecting.,That's how linked data works.,You do your bit. Everybody else does theirs.,You may not have lots of data which you have yourself to put on there,but you know to demand it.,And we've practiced that. 
 So, linked data -- it's huge.,I've only told you a very small number of things,There are data in every aspect of our lives,,every aspect of work and pleasure,,and it's not just about the number of places where data comes,,it's about connecting it together.,And when you connect data together, you get power,in a way that doesn't happen just with the web, with documents.,You get this really huge power out of it.,So, we're at the stage now,where we have to do this -- the people who think it's a great idea.,And all the people -- and I think there's a lot of people at TED who do things because --,even though there's not an immediate return on the investment,because it will only really pay off when everybody else has done it --,they'll do it because they're the sort of person who just does things,which would be good if everybody else did them.,OK, so it's called linked data.,I want you to make it.,I want you to demand it.,And I think it's an idea worth spreading. 
 Thanks. 
 (Applause)Last year I showed these two slides so that,demonstrate that the arctic ice cap,,which for most of the last three million years,has been the size of the lower 48 states,,has shrunk by 40 percent.,But this understates the seriousness of this particular problem,because it doesn't show the thickness of the ice.,The arctic ice cap is, in a sense,,the beating heart of the global climate system.,It expands in winter and contracts in summer.,The next slide I show you will be,a rapid fast-forward of what's happened over the last 25 years.,The permanent ice is marked in red.,As you see, it expands to the dark blue --,that's the annual ice in winter,,and it contracts in summer.,The so-called permanent ice, five years old or older,,you can see is almost like blood,,spilling out of the body here.,In 25 years it's gone from this, to this. 
 This is a problem because the warming,heats up the frozen ground around the Arctic Ocean,,where there is a massive amount of frozen carbon,which, when it thaws, is turned into methane by microbes.,Compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere,,that amount could double if we cross this tipping point.,Already in some shallow lakes in Alaska,,methane is actively bubbling up out of the water.,Professor Katey Walter from the University of Alaska,went out with another team to another shallow lake last winter.,Video: Whoa! (Laughter),Al Gore: She's okay. The question is whether we will be. 
 And one reason is, this enormous heat sink,heats up Greenland from the north.,This is an annual melting river.,But the volumes are much larger than ever.,This is the Kangerlussuaq River in southwest Greenland.,If you want to know how sea level rises,from land-base ice melting,this is where it reaches the sea.,These flows are increasing very rapidly.,At the other end of the planet, Antarctica,the largest mass of ice on the planet.,Last month scientists reported the entire continent,is now in negative ice balance.,And west Antarctica cropped up on top some under-sea islands,,is particularly rapid in its melting.,That's equal to 20 feet of sea level, as is Greenland. 
 In the Himalayas, the third largest mass of ice:,at the top you see new lakes, which a few years ago were glaciers.,40 percent of all the people in the world,get half of their drinking water from that melting flow.,In the Andes, this glacier is the,source of drinking water for this city.,The flows have increased.,But when they go away, so does much of the drinking water.,In California there has been a 40 percent,decline in the Sierra snowpack.,This is hitting the reservoirs.,And the predictions, as you've read, are serious. 
 This drying around the world has lead to,a dramatic increase in fires.,And the disasters around the world,have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary,and unprecedented rate.,Four times as many in the last 30 years,as in the previous 75.,This is a completely unsustainable pattern.,If you look at in the context of history,you can see what this is doing. 
 In the last five years,we've added 70 million tons of CO2,every 24 hours --,25 million tons every day to the oceans.,Look carefully at the area of the eastern Pacific,,from the Americas, extending westward,,and on either side of the Indian subcontinent,,where there is a radical depletion of oxygen in the oceans.,The biggest single cause of global warming,,along with deforestation, which is 20 percent of it, is the burning of fossil fuels.,Oil is a problem, and coal is the most serious problem.,The United States is one of the two,largest emitters, along with China.,And the proposal has been to build a lot more coal plants. 
 But we're beginning to see a sea change.,Here are the ones that have been cancelled in the last few years,with some green alternatives proposed.,(Applause),However there is a political battle,in our country.,And the coal industries and the oil industries,spent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last calendar year,promoting clean coal,,which is an oxymoron.,That image reminded me of something.,(Laughter),Around Christmas, in my home in Tennessee,,a billion gallons of coal sludge was spilled.,You probably saw it on the news.,This, all over the country, is the second largest waste stream in America.,This happened around Christmas.,One of the coal industry's ads around Christmas was this one. 
 Video: ♪♫ Frosty the coal man is a jolly, happy soul.,He's abundant here in America,,and he helps our economy grow.,Frosty the coal man is getting cleaner everyday.,He's affordable and adorable, and workers keep their pay. 
 Al Gore: This is the source of much of the coal in West Virginia.,The largest mountaintop miner is the head of Massey Coal. 
 Video: Don Blankenship: Let me be clear about it. Al Gore,,Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, they don't know what they're talking about. 
 Al Gore: So the Alliance for Climate Protection,has launched two campaigns.,This is one of them, part of one of them. 
 Video: Actor: At COALergy we view climate change as a very serious,threat to our business.,That's why we've made it our primary goal,to spend a large sum of money,on an advertising effort to help bring out and complicate,the truth about coal.,The fact is, coal isn't dirty.,We think it's clean --,smells good, too.,So don't worry about climate change.,Leave that up to us.,(Laughter) 
 Video: Actor: Clean coal -- you've heard a lot about it.,So let's take a tour of this state-of-the-art clean coal facility.,Amazing! The machinery is kind of loud.,But that's the sound of clean coal technology.,And while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming,,the remarkable clean coal technology you see here,changes everything.,Take a good long look: this is today's clean coal technology. 
 Al Gore: Finally, the positive alternative,meshes with our economic challenge,and our national security challenge. 
 Video: Narrator: America is in crisis -- the economy,,national security, the climate crisis.,The thread that links them all:,our addiction to carbon based fuels,,like dirty coal and foreign oil.,But now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this mess.,Repower America with 100 percent clean electricity,within 10 years.,A plan to put America back to work,,make us more secure, and help stop global warming.,Finally, a solution that's big enough to solve our problems.,Repower America. Find out more. 
 Al Gore: This is the last one. 
 Video: Narrator: It's about repowering America.,One of the fastest ways to cut our dependence,on old dirty fuels that are killing our planet.,Man: Future's over here. Wind, sun, a new energy grid.,Man #2: New investments to create high-paying jobs.,Narrator: Repower America. It's time to get real. 
 Al Gore: There is an old African proverb that says,,"If you want to go quickly, go alone.,If you want to go far, go together.",We need to go far, quickly.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)Bacteria are the oldest living organisms on the earth.,They've been here for billions of years,,and what they are are single-celled microscopic organisms.,So they are one cell and they have this special property,that they only have one piece of DNA.,They have very few genes,,and genetic information to encode all of the traits that they carry out.,And the way bacteria make a living,is that they consume nutrients from the environment,,they grow to twice their size, they cut themselves down in the middle,,and one cell becomes two, and so on and so on.,They just grow and divide, and grow and divide -- so a kind of boring life,,except that what I would argue is that you have,an amazing interaction with these critters. 
 I know you guys think of yourself as humans, and this is sort of how I think of you.,This man is supposed to represent,a generic human being,,and all of the circles in that man are all of the cells that make up your body.,There is about a trillion human cells that make each one of us,who we are and able to do all the things that we do,,but you have 10 trillion bacterial cells,in you or on you at any moment in your life.,So, 10 times more bacterial cells,than human cells on a human being.,And of course it's the DNA that counts,,so here's all the A, T, Gs and Cs,that make up your genetic code, and give you all your charming characteristics.,You have about 30,000 genes.,Well it turns out you have 100 times more bacterial genes,playing a role in you or on you all of your life.,At the best, you're 10 percent human,,but more likely about one percent human,,depending on which of these metrics you like.,I know you think of yourself as human beings,,but I think of you as 90 or 99 percent bacterial. 
 (Laughter) 
 These bacteria are not passive riders,,these are incredibly important, they keep us alive.,They cover us in an invisible body armor,that keeps environmental insults out,so that we stay healthy.,They digest our food, they make our vitamins,,they actually educate your immune system,to keep bad microbes out.,So they do all these amazing things,that help us and are vital for keeping us alive,,and they never get any press for that.,But they get a lot of press because they do a lot of,terrible things as well.,So, there's all kinds of bacteria on the Earth,that have no business being in you or on you at any time,,and if they are, they make you incredibly sick. 
 And so, the question for my lab is whether you want to think about all the,good things that bacteria do, or all the bad things that bacteria do.,The question we had is how could they do anything at all?,I mean they're incredibly small,,you have to have a microscope to see one.,They live this sort of boring life where they grow and divide,,and they've always been considered to be these asocial reclusive organisms.,And so it seemed to us that they are just too small to have an impact,on the environment,if they simply act as individuals.,And so we wanted to think if there couldn't be a different,way that bacteria live. 
 The clue to this came from another marine bacterium,,and it's a bacterium called Vibrio fischeri.,What you're looking at on this slide is just a person from my lab,holding a flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium,,a harmless beautiful bacterium that comes from the ocean,,named Vibrio fischeri.,This bacterium has the special property that it makes light,,so it makes bioluminescence,,like fireflies make light.,We're not doing anything to the cells here.,We just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room,,and this is what we see. 
 What was actually interesting to us,was not that the bacteria made light,,but when the bacteria made light.,What we noticed is when the bacteria were alone,,so when they were in dilute suspension, they made no light.,But when they grew to a certain cell number,all the bacteria turned on light simultaneously.,The question that we had is how can bacteria, these primitive organisms,,tell the difference from times when they're alone,,and times when they're in a community,,and then all do something together.,What we've figured out is that the way that they do that is that they talk to each other,,and they talk with a chemical language. 
 This is now supposed to be my bacterial cell.,When it's alone it doesn't make any light.,But what it does do is to make and secrete small molecules,that you can think of like hormones,,and these are the red triangles, and when the bacteria is alone,the molecules just float away and so no light.,But when the bacteria grow and double,and they're all participating in making these molecules,,the molecule -- the extracellular amount of that molecule,increases in proportion to cell number.,And when the molecule hits a certain amount,that tells the bacteria how many neighbors there are,,they recognize that molecule,and all of the bacteria turn on light in synchrony.,That's how bioluminescence works --,they're talking with these chemical words. 
 The reason that Vibrio fischeri is doing that comes from the biology.,Again, another plug for the animals in the ocean,,Vibrio fischeri lives in this squid.,What you are looking at is the Hawaiian Bobtail Squid,,and it's been turned on its back,,and what I hope you can see are these two glowing lobes,and these house the Vibrio fischeri cells,,they live in there, at high cell number,that molecule is there, and they're making light.,The reason the squid is willing to put up with these shenanigans,is because it wants that light.,The way that this symbiosis works,is that this little squid lives just off the coast of Hawaii,,just in sort of shallow knee-deep water.,The squid is nocturnal, so during the day,it buries itself in the sand and sleeps,,but then at night it has to come out to hunt.,On bright nights when there is lots of starlight or moonlight,that light can penetrate the depth of the water,the squid lives in, since it's just in those couple feet of water.,What the squid has developed is a shutter,that can open and close over this specialized light organ housing the bacteria.,Then it has detectors on its back,so it can sense how much starlight or moonlight is hitting its back.,And it opens and closes the shutter,so the amount of light coming out of the bottom --,which is made by the bacterium --,exactly matches how much light hits the squid's back,,so the squid doesn't make a shadow.,It actually uses the light from the bacteria,to counter-illuminate itself in an anti-predation device,so predators can't see its shadow,,calculate its trajectory, and eat it.,This is like the stealth bomber of the ocean. 
 (Laughter) 
 But then if you think about it, the squid has this terrible problem,because it's got this dying, thick culture of bacteria,and it can't sustain that.,And so what happens is every morning when the sun comes up,the squid goes back to sleep, it buries itself in the sand,,and it's got a pump that's attached to its circadian rhythm,,and when the sun comes up it pumps out like 95 percent of the bacteria.,Now the bacteria are dilute, that little hormone molecule is gone,,so they're not making light --,but of course the squid doesn't care. It's asleep in the sand.,And as the day goes by the bacteria double,,they release the molecule, and then light comes on,at night, exactly when the squid wants it. 
 First we figured out how this bacterium does this,,but then we brought the tools of molecular biology to this,to figure out really what's the mechanism.,And what we found -- so this is now supposed to be, again, my bacterial cell --,is that Vibrio fischeri has a protein --,that's the red box -- it's an enzyme that makes,that little hormone molecule, the red triangle.,And then as the cells grow, they're all releasing that molecule,into the environment, so there's lots of molecule there.,And the bacteria also have a receptor on their cell surface,that fits like a lock and key with that molecule.,These are just like the receptors on the surfaces of your cells.,When the molecule increases to a certain amount --,which says something about the number of cells --,it locks down into that receptor,and information comes into the cells,that tells the cells to turn on,this collective behavior of making light. 
 Why this is interesting is because in the past decade,we have found that this is not just some anomaly,of this ridiculous, glow-in-the-dark bacterium that lives in the ocean --,all bacteria have systems like this.,So now what we understand is that all bacteria can talk to each other.,They make chemical words, they recognize those words,,and they turn on group behaviors,that are only successful when all of the cells participate in unison.,We have a fancy name for this: we call it quorum sensing.,They vote with these chemical votes,,the vote gets counted, and then everybody responds to the vote. 
 What's important for today's talk,is that we know that there are hundreds of behaviors,that bacteria carry out in these collective fashions.,But the one that's probably the most important to you is virulence.,It's not like a couple bacteria get in you,and they start secreting some toxins --,you're enormous, that would have no effect on you. You're huge.,What they do, we now understand,,is they get in you, they wait, they start growing,,they count themselves with these little molecules,,and they recognize when they have the right cell number,that if all of the bacteria launch their virulence attack together,,they are going to be successful at overcoming an enormous host.,Bacteria always control pathogenicity with quorum sensing.,That's how it works. 
 We also then went to look at what are these molecules --,these were the red triangles on my slides before.,This is the Vibrio fischeri molecule.,This is the word that it talks with.,So then we started to look at other bacteria,,and these are just a smattering of the molecules that we've discovered.,What I hope you can see,is that the molecules are related.,The left-hand part of the molecule is identical,in every single species of bacteria.,But the right-hand part of the molecule is a little bit different in every single species.,What that does is to confer,exquisite species specificities to these languages.,Each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other.,So these are private, secret conversations.,These conversations are for intraspecies communication.,Each bacteria uses a particular molecule that's its language,that allows it to count its own siblings. 
 Once we got that far we thought,we were starting to understand that bacteria have these social behaviors.,But what we were really thinking about is that most of the time,bacteria don't live by themselves, they live in incredible mixtures,,with hundreds or thousands of other species of bacteria.,And that's depicted on this slide. This is your skin.,So this is just a picture -- a micrograph of your skin.,Anywhere on your body, it looks pretty much like this,,and what I hope you can see is that there's all kinds of bacteria there.,And so we started to think if this really is about communication in bacteria,,and it's about counting your neighbors,,it's not enough to be able to only talk within your species.,There has to be a way to take a census,of the rest of the bacteria in the population. 
 So we went back to molecular biology,and started studying different bacteria,,and what we've found now is that,in fact, bacteria are multilingual.,They all have a species-specific system --,they have a molecule that says "me.",But then, running in parallel to that is a second system,that we've discovered, that's generic.,So, they have a second enzyme that makes a second signal,and it has its own receptor,,and this molecule is the trade language of bacteria.,It's used by all different bacteria,and it's the language of interspecies communication.,What happens is that bacteria are able to count,how many of me and how many of you.,They take that information inside,,and they decide what tasks to carry out,depending on who's in the minority and who's in the majority,of any given population. 
 Then again we turn to chemistry,,and we figured out what this generic molecule is --,that was the pink ovals on my last slide, this is it.,It's a very small, five-carbon molecule.,What the important thing is that we learned,is that every bacterium has exactly the same enzyme,and makes exactly the same molecule.,So they're all using this molecule,for interspecies communication.,This is the bacterial Esperanto. 
 (Laughter) 
 Once we got that far, we started to learn,that bacteria can talk to each other with this chemical language.,But what we started to think is that maybe there is something,practical that we can do here as well.,I've told you that bacteria do have all these social behaviors,,they communicate with these molecules.,Of course, I've also told you that one of the important things they do,is to initiate pathogenicity using quorum sensing.,We thought, what if we made these bacteria,so they can't talk or they can't hear?,Couldn't these be new kinds of antibiotics? 
 Of course, you've just heard and you already know,that we're running out of antibiotics.,Bacteria are incredibly multi-drug-resistant right now,,and that's because all of the antibiotics that we use kill bacteria.,They either pop the bacterial membrane,,they make the bacterium so it can't replicate its DNA.,We kill bacteria with traditional antibiotics,and that selects for resistant mutants.,And so now of course we have this global problem,in infectious diseases.,We thought, well what if we could sort of do behavior modifications,,just make these bacteria so they can't talk, they can't count,,and they don't know to launch virulence. 
 And so that's exactly what we've done, and we've sort of taken two strategies.,The first one is we've targeted,the intraspecies communication system.,So we made molecules that look kind of like the real molecules --,which you saw -- but they're a little bit different.,And so they lock into those receptors,,and they jam recognition of the real thing.,By targeting the red system,,what we are able to do is to make,species-specific, or disease-specific, anti-quorum sensing molecules.,We've also done the same thing with the pink system.,We've taken that universal molecule and turned it around a little bit,so that we've made antagonists,of the interspecies communication system.,The hope is that these will be used as broad-spectrum antibiotics,that work against all bacteria. 
 To finish I'll just show you the strategy.,In this one I'm just using the interspecies molecule,,but the logic is exactly the same.,What you know is that when that bacterium gets into the animal,,in this case, a mouse,,it doesn't initiate virulence right away.,It gets in, it starts growing, it starts secreting,its quorum sensing molecules.,It recognizes when it has enough bacteria,that now they're going to launch their attack,,and the animal dies.,What we've been able to do is to give these virulent infections,,but we give them in conjunction with our anti-quorum sensing molecules --,so these are molecules that look kind of like the real thing,,but they're a little bit different which I've depicted on this slide.,What we now know is that if we treat the animal,with a pathogenic bacterium -- a multi-drug-resistant pathogenic bacterium --,in the same time we give our anti-quorum sensing molecule,,in fact, the animal lives. 
 We think that this is the next generation of antibiotics,and it's going to get us around, at least initially,,this big problem of resistance.,What I hope you think, is that bacteria can talk to each other,,they use chemicals as their words,,they have an incredibly complicated chemical lexicon,that we're just now starting to learn about.,Of course what that allows bacteria to do,is to be multicellular.,So in the spirit of TED they're doing things together,because it makes a difference.,What happens is that bacteria have these collective behaviors,,and they can carry out tasks,that they could never accomplish,if they simply acted as individuals. 
 What I would hope that I could further argue to you,is that this is the invention of multicellularity.,Bacteria have been on the Earth for billions of years;,humans, couple hundred thousand.,We think bacteria made the rules,for how multicellular organization works.,We think, by studying bacteria,,we're going to be able to have insight about multicellularity in the human body.,We know that the principles and the rules,,if we can figure them out in these sort of primitive organisms,,the hope is that they will be applied,to other human diseases and human behaviors as well.,I hope that what you've learned,is that bacteria can distinguish self from other.,By using these two molecules they can say "me" and they can say "you.",Again of course that's what we do,,both in a molecular way,,and also in an outward way,,but I think about the molecular stuff. 
 This is exactly what happens in your body.,It's not like your heart cells and your kidney cells get all mixed up every day,,and that's because there's all of this chemistry going on,,these molecules that say who each of these groups of cells is,,and what their tasks should be.,Again, we think that bacteria invented that,,and you've just evolved a few more bells and whistles,,but all of the ideas are in these simple systems that we can study. 
 The final thing is, again just to reiterate that there's this practical part,,and so we've made these anti-quorum sensing molecules,that are being developed as new kinds of therapeutics.,But then, to finish with a plug for all the good and miraculous bacteria,that live on the Earth,,we've also made pro-quorum sensing molecules.,So, we've targeted those systems to make the molecules work better.,Remember you have these 10 times or more bacterial cells,in you or on you, keeping you healthy.,What we're also trying to do is to beef up the conversation,of the bacteria that live as mutualists with you,,in the hopes of making you more healthy,,making those conversations better,,so bacteria can do things that we want them to do,better than they would be on their own. 
 Finally, I wanted to show you,this is my gang at Princeton, New Jersey.,Everything I told you about was discovered by someone in that picture.,I hope when you learn things,,like about how the natural world works --,I just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper,or you get to hear some talk about something ridiculous in the natural world,it was done by a child.,Science is done by that demographic.,All of those people are between 20 and 30 years old,,and they are the engine that drives scientific discovery in this country.,It's a really lucky demographic to work with.,I keep getting older and older and they're always the same age,,and it's just a crazy delightful job.,I want to thank you for inviting me here.,It's a big treat for me to get to come to this conference. 
 (Applause) 
 Thanks. 
 (Applause)Two years ago here at TED,I reported that we had discovered,at Saturn, with the Cassini Spacecraft,,an anomalously warm and geologically active region,at the southern tip of the small Saturnine moon,Enceladus, seen here.,This region seen here for the first time,in the Cassini image taken in 2005. This is the south polar region,,with the famous tiger-stripe fractures crossing the south pole.,And seen just recently in late 2008,,here is that region again,,now half in darkness because the southern hemisphere,is experiencing the onset of August,and eventually winter. 
 And I also reported that we'd made this mind-blowing discovery --,this once-in-a-lifetime discovery,of towering jets,erupting from those fractures at the south pole,,consisting of tiny water ice crystals,accompanied by water vapor,and simple organic compounds like carbon dioxide and methane.,And at that time two years ago,I mentioned that we were speculating,that these jets might in fact be geysers,,and erupting from pockets,or chambers of liquid water underneath the surface,,but we weren't really sure.,However, the implications of those results --,of a possible environment within this moon,that could support prebiotic chemistry,,and perhaps life itself --,were so exciting that, in the intervening two years,,we have focused more on Enceladus. 
 We've flown the Cassini Spacecraft,by this moon now several times,,flying closer and deeper into these jets,,into the denser regions of these jets,,so that now we have come away with some,very precise compositional measurements.,And we have found,that the organic compounds coming from this moon,are in fact more complex than we previously reported.,While they're not amino acids,,we're now finding things like,propane and benzene,,hydrogen cyanide, and formaldehyde.,And the tiny water crystals here,now look for all the world,like they are frozen droplets of salty water,,which is a discovery that suggests,that not only do the jets come from,pockets of liquid water,,but that that liquid water is in contact with rock.,And that is a circumstance,that could supply the chemical energy,and the chemical compounds needed to sustain life. 
 So we are very encouraged by these results.,And we are much more confident now than we were two years ago,that we might indeed,have on this moon, under the south pole,,an environment or a zone that is hospitable to living organisms.,Whether or not there are living organisms there, of course,,is an entirely different matter.,And that will have to await the arrival,,back at Enceladus,,of the spacecrafts, hopefully some time in the near future,,specifically equipped to address that particular question.,But in the meantime I invite you to imagine the day,when we might journey to the Saturnine system,,and visit the Enceladus interplanetary geyser park,,just because we can. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)A talk about surgical robots,is also a talk about surgery.,And while I've tried to make my images not too graphic,,keep in mind that surgeons have a different relationship with blood,than normal people do,,because, after all, what a surgeon does to a patient,,if it were done without consent,,would be a felony.,Surgeons are the tailors, the plumbers,,the carpenters -- some would say the butchers --,of the medical world:,cutting, reshaping, reforming,,bypassing, fixing.,But you need to talk about surgical instruments,and the evolution of surgical technology together. 
 So in order to give you some kind of a perspective,of where we are right now,with surgical robots,,and where we're going to be going in the future,,I want to give you a little bit of perspective,of how we got to this point,,how we even came to believe,that surgery was OK,,that this was something that was possible to do,,that this kind of cutting and reforming was OK. 
 So, a little bit of perspective --,about 10,000 years of perspective.,This is a trephinated skull.,And trephination is simply just cutting a hole in the skull.,And many, many hundreds of skulls like this,have been found in archaeological sites,all over the world,,dating back five to 10 thousand years.,Five to 10 thousand years! Now imagine this.,You are a healer in a Stone Age village.,And you have some guy that you're not quite sure what's wrong with him --,Oliver Sacks is going to be born way in the future.,He's got some seizure disorder. And you don't understand this.,But you think to yourself,,"I'm not quite sure what's wrong with this guy.,But maybe if I cut a hole in his head I can fix it.",(Laughter),Now that is surgical thinking. 
 Now we've got the dawn of interventional surgery here.,What is astonishing about this is,,even though we don't know really how much of this,was intended to be religious,,or how much of it was intended to be therapeutic,,what we can tell is that these patients lived!,Judging by the healing on the borders of these holes,,they lived days, months, years following trephination.,And so what we are seeing is evidence,of a refined technique,that was being handed down over thousands and thousands of years,,all over the world.,This arose independently at sites everywhere,that had no communication to one another.,We really are seeing the dawn of interventional surgery. 
 Now we can fast forward many thousands of years,into the Bronze Age and beyond.,And we see new refined tools coming out.,But surgeons in these eras are a little bit more conservative,than their bold, trephinating ancestors.,These guys confined their surgery,to fairly superficial injuries.,And surgeons were tradesmen,,rather than physicians.,This persisted all the way into and through the Renaissance. 
 That may have saved the writers,,but it didn't really save the surgeons terribly much.,They were still a mistrusted lot.,Surgeons still had a bit of a PR problem,,because the landscape was dominated,by the itinerant barber surgeon.,These were folks that traveled from village to village, town to town,,doing surgery sort of as a form of performance art.,Because we were in the age before anesthesia,,the agony of the patient,is really as much of the public spectacle,as the surgery itself.,One of the most famous of these guys, Frere Jacques,,shown here doing a lithotomy --,which is the removal of the bladder stone,,one of the most invasive surgeries they did at the time --,had to take less than two minutes.,You had to have quite a flair for the dramatic,,and be really, really quick. 
 And so here you see him doing a lithotomy.,And he is credited with doing over 4,000 of these public surgeries,,wandering around in Europe,,which is an astonishing number,,when you think that surgery must have been a last resort.,I mean who would put themselves through that?,Until anesthesia, the absence of sensation.,With the demonstration of the Morton Ether Inhaler,at the Mass. General in 1847,,a whole new era of surgery was ushered in.,Anesthesia gave surgeons the freedom to operate.,Anesthesia gave them the freedom to experiment,,to start to delve deeper into the body.,This was truly a revolution in surgery. 
 But there was a pretty big problem with this.,After these very long, painstaking operations,,attempting to cure things they'd never been able to touch before,,the patients died.,They died of massive infection.,Surgery didn't hurt anymore,,but it killed you pretty quickly.,And infection would continue to claim a majority of surgical patients,until the next big revolution in surgery,,which was aseptic technique. 
 Joseph Lister was aepsis's,,or sterility's, biggest advocate,,to a very very skeptical bunch of surgeons.,But eventually they did come around.,The Mayo brothers came out to visit Lister in Europe.,And they came back to their American clinic and they said,they had learned it was as important to wash your hands,before doing surgery,as it was to wash up afterwards. (Laughter),Something so simple.,And yet, operative mortality dropped profoundly. 
 These surgeries were actually now being effective.,With the patient insensitive to pain,,and a sterile operating field,all bets were off, the sky was the limit.,You could now start doing surgery everywhere,,on the gut, on the liver,,on the heart, on the brain.,Transplantation: you could take an organ out of one person,,you could put it in another person, and it would work.,Surgeons didn't have a problem with respectability anymore;,they had become gods. 
 The era of the "big surgeon, big incision" had arrived,,but at quite a cost,,because they are saving lives,,but not necessarily quality of life,,because healthy people don't usually need surgery,,and unhealthy people have a very hard time recovering from a cut like that.,The question had to be asked,,"Well, can we do these same surgeries,but through little incisions?",Laparoscopy is doing this kind of surgery:,surgery with long instruments through small incisions.,And it really changed the landscape of surgery.,Some of the tools for this had been around for a hundred years,,but it had only been used as a diagnostic technique,until the 1980s,,when there was changes in camera technologies and things like that,,that allowed this to be done for real operations. 
 So what you see -- this is now the first surgical image --,as we're coming down the tube, this is a new entry into the body.,It looks very different from what you're expecting surgery to look like.,We bring instruments in,,from two separate cuts in the side,,and then you can start manipulating tissue.,Within 10 years of the first gallbladder surgeries,being done laparoscopically,,a majority of gallbladder surgeries,were being done laparoscopically --,truly a pretty big revolution. 
 But there were casualties of this revolution.,These techniques were a lot harder to learn,than people had anticipated.,The learning curve was very long.,And during that learning curve the complications went quite a bit higher.,Surgeons had to give up their 3D vision.,They had to give up their wrists.,They had to give up intuitive motion in the instruments.,This surgeon has over 3,000 hours of laparoscopic experience.,Now this is a particularly frustrating placement of the needle.,But this is hard.,And one of the reasons why it is so hard,is because the external ergonomics are terrible.,You've got these long instruments, and you're working off your centerline.,And the instruments are essentially working backwards. 
 So what you need to do, to take the capability of your hand,,and put it on the other side of that small incision,,is you need to put a wrist on that instrument.,And so -- I get to talk about robots --,the da Vinci robot,put just that wrist on the other side of that incision.,And so here you're seeing the operation of this wrist.,And now, in contrast to the laparoscopy,,you can precisely place the needle in your instruments,,and you can pass it all the way through,and follow it in a trajectory.,And the reason why this becomes so much easier,is -- you can see on the bottom --,the hands are making the motions,,and the instruments are following those motions exactly.,Now, what you put between those instruments and those hands,,is a large, fairly complicated robot.,The surgeon is sitting at a console,,and controlling the robot with these controllers.,And the robot is moving these instruments around,,and powering them, down inside the body.,You have a 3D camera, so you get a 3D view. 
 And since this was introduced in 1999,,a lot of these robots have been out,and being used for surgical procedures like a prostatectomy,,which is a prostate deep in the pelvis,,and it requires fine dissection,and delicate manipulation,to be able to get a good surgical outcome.,You can also sew bypass vessels directly onto a beating heart,without cracking the chest.,This is all done in between the ribs.,And you can go inside the heart itself,and repair the valves from the inside.,You've got these technologies -- thank you --,(Applause),And so you might say, "Wow this is really cool!,So, smartypants, why isn't all surgery being done this way?",And there are some reasons, some good reasons.,And cost is one of them. 
 I talked about the large, complicated robot.,With all its bells and whistles, one of those robots,will cost you about as much as a solid gold surgeon.,More useful than a solid gold surgeon,,but, still, it's a fairly big capital investment.,But once you've got it, your procedure costs do come down.,But there are other barriers.,So something like a prostatectomy --,the prostate is small, and it's in one spot,,and you can set your robot up very precisely,to work in that one spot.,And so it's perfect for something like that.,And in fact if you, or anyone you know,,had their prostate taken out in the last couple of years,,chances are it was done with one of these systems.,But if you need to reach more places than just one,,you need to move the robot.,And you need to put some new incisions in there.,And you need to re-set it up.,And then you need to add some more ports, and more.,And the problem is it gets time-consuming, and cumbersome. 
 And for that reason there are many surgeries,that just aren't being done with the da Vinci.,So we had to ask the question, "Well how do we fix that?",What if we could change it so that we didn't have to re-set up,each time we wanted to move somewhere different?,What if we could bring all the instruments,in together in one place?,How would that change the capabilities of the surgeon?,And how would that change the experience for the patient?,Now, to do that,,we need to be able to bring a camera,and instruments in together through one small tube,,like that tube you saw in the laparoscopy video.,Or, not so coincidentally, like a tube like this. 
 So what's going to come out of that tube,is the debut of this new technology,,this new robot that is going to be able to reach anywhere.,Ready? So here it comes.,This is the camera, and three instruments.,And as you see it come out,,in order to actually be able to do anything useful,,it can't all stay clustered up like this.,It has to be able to come off of the centerline,and then be able to work back toward that centerline.,He's a cheeky little devil.,But what this lets you do,is gives you that all-important traction,,and counter-traction,,so that you can dissect, so that you can sew,,so that you can do all the things that you need to do,,all the surgical tasks.,But it's all coming in through one incision.,It's not so simple.,But it's worth it for the freedom that this gives us,as we're going around.,For the patient, however,,it's transparent. This is all they're going to see. 
 It's very exciting to think where we get to go with this.,We get to write the script of the next revolution in surgery.,As we take these capabilities, and we get to go to the next places,,we get to decide what our new surgeries are going to be.,And I think to really get the rest of the way,in that revolution,,we need to not just take our hands in in new ways,,we also need to take our eyes in in new ways.,We need to see beyond the surface.,We need to be able to guide what we're cutting,in a much better way. 
 This is a cancer surgery.,One of the problems with this,,even for surgeons who've been looking at this a lot,,is you can't see the cancer,,especially when it's hidden below the surface.,And so what we're starting to do,is we're starting to inject specially designed markers,into the bloodstream that will target the cancer.,It will go, bind to the cancer.,And we can make those markers glow.,And we can take special cameras,,and we can look at it.,Now we know where we need to cut,,even when it's below the surface.,We can take these markers and we can inject them in a tumor site.,And we can follow where they flow out from that tumor site,,so we can see the first places where that cancer might travel.,We can inject these dyes into the bloodstream,,so that when we do a new vessel,and we bypass a blockage on the heart,,we can see if we actually made the connection,,before we close that patient back up again --,something that we haven't been able to do,without radiation before.,We can light up tumors,like this kidney tumor,,so that you can exactly see where the boundary is,between the kidney tumor and the kidney you want to leave behind,,or the liver tumor and the liver you want to leave behind. 
 And we don't even need to confine ourselves,to this macro vision.,We have flexible microscopic probes,that we can bring down into the body.,And we can look at cells directly.,I'm looking at nerves here. So these are nerves you see, down on the bottom,,and the microscope probe that's being held by the robotic hand, up at the top.,So this is all very prototypey at this point.,But you care about nerves, if you are a surgical patient.,Because they let you keep continence,,bladder control, and sexual function after surgery,,all of which is generally fairly important to the patient. 
 So, with the combination of these technologies,we can reach it all, and we can see it all.,We can heal the disease.,And we can leave the patient whole and intact,and functional afterwards.,Now, I've talked about the patient,as if the patient is, somehow, someone abstract,outside this room.,And that is not the case.,Many of you, all of you maybe,,will at some point, or have already, faced a diagnosis of cancer,,or heart disease, or some organ dysfunction,that's going to buy you a date with a surgeon.,And when you get to that point --,I mean, these maladies don't care,how many books you've written,,how many companies you've started,,that Nobel Prize you have yet to win,,how much time you planned to spend with your children.,These maladies come for us all. 
 And the prospect I'm offering you, of an easier surgery ...,is that going to make that diagnosis any less terrifying?,I'm not sure I really even want it to.,Because facing your own mortality,causes a re-evaluation of priorities,,and a realignment of what your goals are in life, unlike anything else.,And I would never want to deprive you of that epiphany.,What I want instead,,is for you to be whole, intact,,and functional enough to go out and save the world,,after you've decided you need to do it.,And that is my vision for your future.,Thank you.,(Applause)So I am a pediatric cancer doctor,and stem-cell researcher at Stanford University,where my clinical focus has been bone marrow transplantation.,Now, inspired by Jill Bolte Taylor last year,,I didn't bring a human brain,,but I did bring a liter of bone marrow.,And bone marrow is actually what we use,to save the lives of tens of thousands of patients,,most of whom have advanced malignancies like leukemia and lymphoma,and some other diseases. 
 So, a few years ago, I'm doing my transplant fellowship at Stanford.,I'm in the operating room. We have Bob here,,who is a volunteer donor.,We're sending his marrow across the country to save the life,of a child with leukemia.,So actually how do we harvest this bone marrow?,Well we have a whole O.R. team, general anesthesia, nurses,,and another doctor across from me.,Bob's on the table, and we take this sort of small needle,,you know, not too big.,And the way we do this is we basically,place this through the soft tissue,,and kind of punch it into the hard bone,,into the tuchus -- that's a technical term --,and aspirate about 10 mls of bone marrow out,,each time, with a syringe.,And hand it off to the nurse. She squirts it into a tin.,Hands it back to me. And we do that again and again.,About 200 times usually.,And by the end of this my arm is sore, I've got a callus on my hand,,let alone Bob,,whose rear end looks something more like this,,like Swiss cheese. 
 So I'm thinking, you know, this procedure hasn't changed in about 40 years.,And there is probably a better way to do this.,So I thought of a minimally invasive approach,,and a new device that we call the Marrow Miner.,This is it.,And the Marrow Miner, the way it works is shown here. 
 Our standard see-through patient.,Instead of entering the bone dozens of times,,we enter just once, into the front of the hip or the back of the hip.,And we have a flexible, powered catheter,with a special wire loop tip that stays inside the crunchy part of the marrow,and follows the contours of the hip, as it moves around.,So it enables you to very rapidly aspirate,,or suck out, rich bone marrow very quickly through one hole.,We can do multiple passes through that same entry.,No robots required.,And, so, very quickly, Bob can just get one puncture, local anesthesia,,and do this harvest as an outpatient. 
 So I did a few prototypes. I got a small little grant at Stanford.,And played around with this a little bit.,And our team members developed this technology.,And eventually we got two large animals, and pig studies.,And we found, to our surprise, that we not only got bone marrow out,,but we got 10 times the stem cell activity,in the marrow from the Marrow Miner, compared to the normal device.,This device was just FDA approved in the last year. 
 Here is a live patient. You can see it following the flexible curves around.,There will be two passes here, in the same patient, from the same hole.,This was done under local anesthesia, as an outpatient.,And we got, again, about three to six times more stem cells,than the standard approach done on the same patient. 
 So why should you care? Bone marrow is a very rich source of adult stem cells.,You all know about embryonic stem cells.,They've got great potential but haven't yet entered clinical trials.,Adult stem cells are throughout our body,,including the blood-forming stem cells in our bone marrow,,which we've been using as a form of stem-cell therapy,for over 40 years.,In the last decade there's been an explosion of use,of bone marrow stem cells to treat the patient's other diseases,such as heart disease, vascular disease,,orthopedics, tissue engineering,,even in neurology to treat Parkinson's,and diabetes. 
 We've just come out, we're commercializing, this year,,generation 2.0 of the Marrow Miner.,The hope is that this gets more stem cells out,,which translates to better outcomes.,It may encourage more people to sign up to be,potential live-saving bone marrow donors.,It may even enable you to bank,your own marrow stem cells, when you're younger and healthier,,to use in the future should you need it.,And ultimately -- and here's a picture of our,bone marrow transplant survivors,,who come together for a reunion each year at Stanford.,Hopefully this technology will let us,have more of these survivors in the future.,Thanks. 
 (Applause)I'll start with my favorite muse, Emily Dickinson,,who said that wonder is not knowledge, neither is it ignorance.,It's something which is suspended,between what we believe we can be,,and a tradition we may have forgotten.,And I think, when I listen to these incredible people here,,I've been so inspired -- so many incredible ideas, so many visions.,And yet, when I look at the environment outside,,you see how resistant architecture is to change.,You see how resistant it is to those very ideas.,We can think them out. We can create incredible things.,And yet, at the end,,it's so hard to change a wall.,We applaud the well-mannered box.,But to create a space that never existed is what interests me;,to create something that has never been,,a space that we have never entered except in our minds and our spirits.,And I think that's really what architecture is based on. 
 Architecture is not based on concrete,and steel and the elements of the soil.,It's based on wonder.,And that wonder is really what has created the greatest cities,,the greatest spaces that we have had.,And I think that is indeed what architecture is. It is a story.,By the way, it is a story that is told through,its hard materials.,But it is a story of effort and struggle,against improbabilities.,If you think of the great buildings, of the cathedrals, of the temples,,of the pyramids, of pagodas,,of cities in India and beyond,,you think of how incredible this is that that was realized,not by some abstract idea, but by people. 
 So, anything that has been made can be unmade.,Anything that has been made can be made better.,There it is: the things that I really believe,are of important architecture.,These are the dimensions that I like to work with.,It's something very personal.,It's not, perhaps, the dimensions appreciated by art critics,or architecture critics or city planners.,But I think these are the necessary oxygen,for us to live in buildings, to live in cities,,to connect ourselves in a social space. 
 And I therefore believe that optimism is what drives architecture forward.,It's the only profession where you have to believe in the future.,You can be a general, a politician, an economist who is depressed,,a musician in a minor key, a painter in dark colors.,But architecture is that complete ecstasy that the future can be better.,And it is that belief that I think drives society. 
 And today we have a kind of evangelical pessimism all around us.,And yet it is in times like this,that I think architecture can thrive with big ideas,,ideas that are not small. Think of the great cities.,Think of the Empire State Building, the Rockefeller Center.,They were built in times that were,not really the best of times in a certain way.,And yet that energy and power of architecture,has driven an entire social and political space that these buildings occupy. 
 So again, I am a believer in the expressive.,I have never been a fan of the neutral.,I don't like neutrality in life, in anything.,I think expression.,And it's like espresso coffee, you know, you take the essence of the coffee.,That's what expression is.,It's been missing in much of the architecture,,because we think architecture is the realm of the neutered,,the realm of the kind of a state that has no opinion,,that has no value.,And yet, I believe it is the expression --,expression of the city, expression of our own space --,that gives meaning to architecture. 
 And, of course, expressive spaces are not mute.,Expressive spaces are not spaces,that simply confirm what we already know.,Expressive spaces may disturb us.,And I think that's also part of life.,Life is not just an anesthetic to make us smile,,but to reach out across the abyss of history,,to places we have never been,,and would have perhaps been, had we not been so lucky. 
 So again, radical versus conservative.,Radical, what does it mean? It's something which is rooted,,and something which is rooted deep in a tradition.,And I think that is what architecture is, it's radical.,It's not just a conservation in formaldehyde,of dead forms.,It is actually a living connection,to the cosmic event that we are part of,,and a story that is certainly ongoing.,It's not something that has a good ending or a bad ending.,It's actually a story in which our acts themselves,are pushing the story in a particular way. 
 So again I am a believer in the radical architecture.,You know the Soviet architecture of that building,is the conservation.,It's like the old Las Vegas used to be.,It's about conserving emotions, conserving the traditions,that have obstructed the mind in moving forward,and of course what is radical is to confront them.,And I think our architecture is a confrontation,with our own senses.,Therefore I believe it should not be cool. 
 There is a lot of appreciation for the kind of cool architecture.,I've always been an opponent of it. I think emotion is needed.,Life without emotion would really not be life.,Even the mind is emotional.,There is no reason which does not take a position,in the ethical sphere, in the philosophical mystery of what we are.,So I think emotion is a dimension,that is important to introduce into city space, into city life. 
 And of course, we are all about the struggle of emotions.,And I think that is what makes the world a wondrous place.,And of course, the confrontation of the cool, the unemotional with emotion,,is a conversation that I think,cities themselves have fostered.,I think that is the progress of cities.,It's not only the forms of cities,,but the fact that they incarnate emotions,,not just of those who build them,,but of those who live there as well. 
 Inexplicable versus understood. You know, too often we want to understand everything.,But architecture is not the language of words.,It's a language. But it is not a language that can be reduced,to a series of programmatic notes that we can verbally write.,Too many buildings that you see outside that are so banal,tell you a story, but the story is very short,,which says, "We have no story to tell you.",(Laughter) 
 So the important thing actually,,is to introduce the actual architectural dimensions,,which might be totally inexplicable in words,,because they operate in proportions,,in materials, in light.,They connect themselves into various sources,,into a kind of complex vector matrix,that isn't really frontal,but is really embedded in the lives,,and in the history of a city, and of a people.,So again, the notion that a building should just be explicit,I think is a false notion,,which has reduced architecture into banality. 
 Hand versus the computer.,Of course, what would we be without computers?,Our whole practice depends on computing.,But the computer should not just be the glove of the hand;,the hand should really be the driver of the computing power.,Because I believe that the hand,in all its primitive, in all its physiological obscurity,,has a source, though the source is unknown,,though we don't have to be mystical about it.,We realize that the hand has been given us,by forces that are beyond our own autonomy.,And I think when I draw drawings,which may imitate the computer, but are not computer drawings --,drawings that can come from sources,that are completely not known, not normal, not seen,,yet the hand -- and that's what I really, to all of you who are working --,how can we make the computer respond to our hand,rather than the hand responding to the computer. 
 I think that's part of what the complexity of architecture is.,Because certainly we have gotten used to the propaganda,that the simple is the good. But I don't believe it.,Listening to all of you, the complexity of thought,,the complexity of layers of meaning is overwhelming.,And I think we shouldn't shy away in architecture,,You know, brain surgery, atomic theory,,genetics, economics,are complex complex fields.,There is no reason that architecture should shy away,and present this illusory world of the simple.,It is complex. Space is complex.,Space is something that folds out of itself into completely new worlds.,And as wondrous as it is,,it cannot be reduced to a kind of simplification,that we have often come to be admired.,And yet, our lives are complex.,Our emotions are complex.,Our intellectual desires are complex.,So I do believe that architecture as I see it,needs to mirror that complexity in every single space that we have,,in every intimacy that we possess. 
 Of course that means that architecture is political.,The political is not an enemy of architecture.,The politeama is the city. It's all of us together.,And I've always believed that the act of architecture,,even a private house, when somebody else will see it, is a political act,,because it will be visible to others.,And we live in a world which is connecting us more and more.,So again, the evasion of that sphere,,which has been so endemic to that sort of pure architecture,,the autonomous architecture that is just an abstract object,has never appealed to me.,And I do believe that this interaction,with the history, with history that is often very difficult,,to grapple with it, to create,a position that is beyond our normal expectations and to create a critique. 
 Because architecture is also the asking of questions.,It's not only the giving of answers.,It's also, just like life, the asking of questions.,Therefore it is important that it be real.,You know we can simulate almost anything.,But the one thing that can be ever simulated,is the human heart, the human soul.,And architecture is so closely intertwined with it,because we are born somewhere and we die somewhere.,So the reality of architecture is visceral. It's not intellectual.,It's not something that comes to us from books and theories.,It's the real that we touch -- the door, the window,,the threshold, the bed --,such prosaic objects. And yet,,I try, in every building, to take that virtual world,,which is so enigmatic and so rich,,and create something in the real world.,Create a space for an office,,a space of sustainability,that really works between that virtuality,and yet can be realized as something real. 
 Unexpected versus habitual.,What is a habit? It's just a shackle for ourselves.,It's a self-induced poison.,So the unexpected is always unexpected.,You know, it's true, the cathedrals, as unexpected,,will always be unexpected.,You know Frank Gehry's buildings, they will continue to be unexpected in the future.,So not the habitual architecture that instills in us,the false sort of stability,,but an architecture that is full of tension,,an architecture that goes beyond itself,to reach a human soul and a human heart,,and that breaks out of the shackles of habits. 
 And of course habits are enforced by architecture.,When we see the same kind of architecture,we become immured in that world of those angles,,of those lights, of those materials.,We think the world really looks like our buildings.,And yet our buildings are pretty much limited by the techniques and wonders,that have been part of them. 
 So again, the unexpected which is also the raw.,And I often think of the raw and the refined.,What is raw? The raw, I would say,is the naked experience, untouched by luxury,,untouched by expensive materials,,untouched by the kind of refinement,that we associate with high culture.,So the rawness, I think, in space,,the fact that sustainability can actually, in the future,translate into a raw space,,a space that isn't decorated,,a space that is not mannered in any source,,but a space that might be cool in terms of its temperature,,might be refractive to our desires.,A space that doesn't always follow us,like a dog that has been trained to follow us,,but moves ahead into directions of demonstrating,other possibilities, other experiences,,that have never been part of the vocabulary of architecture. 
 And of course that juxtaposition is of great interest to me,because it creates a kind of a spark of new energy.,And so I do like something which is pointed, not blunt,,something which is focused on reality,,something that has the power, through its leverage,,to transform even a very small space. 
 So architecture maybe is not so big, like science,,but through its focal point,it can leverage in an Archimedian way,what we think the world is really about.,And often it takes just a building,to change our experience of what could be done, what has been done,,how the world has remained both in between stability and instability.,And of course buildings have their shapes.,Those shapes are difficult to change.,And yet, I do believe that in every social space,,in every public space,,there is a desire to communicate more,than just that blunt thought, that blunt technique,,but something that pinpoints, and can point in various directions,forward, backward, sideways and around.,So that is indeed what is memory.,So I believe that my main interest is to memory.,Without memory we would be amnesiacs.,We would not know which way we were going,,and why we are going where we're going. 
 So I've been never interested in the forgettable reuse,,rehashing of the same things over and over again,,which, of course, get accolades of critics.,Critics like the performance to be repeated again and again the same way.,But I rather play something,completely unheard of,,and even with flaws,,than repeat the same thing over and over which has been hollowed,by its meaninglessness.,So again, memory is the city, memory is the world.,Without the memory there would be no story to tell.,There would be nowhere to turn. 
 The memorable, I think, is really our world, what we think the world is.,And it's not only our memory,,but those who remember us,,which means that architecture is not mute.,It's an art of communication.,It tells a story. The story can reach into obscure desires.,It can reach into sources that are not explicitly available.,It can reach into millennia,that have been buried,,and return them in a just and unexpected equity. 
 So again, I think the notion that,the best architecture is silent has never appealed to me.,Silence maybe is good for a cemetery but not for a city.,Cities should be full of vibrations, full of sound, full of music.,And that indeed is the architectural mission,that I believe is important,,is to create spaces that are vibrant,,that are pluralistic,,that can transform the most prosaic activities,,and raise them to a completely different expectation.,Create a shopping center, a swimming place,that is more like a museum than like entertainment.,And these are our dreams. 
 And of course risk. I think architecture should be risky.,You know it costs a lot of money and so on, but yes,,it should not play it safe.,It should not play it safe, because if it plays it safe,it's not moving us in a direction that we want to be.,And I think, of course,,risk is what underlies the world.,World without risk would not be worth living.,So yes, I do believe that the risk we take in every building.,Risks to create spaces that have never been cantilevered to that extent.,Risks of spaces that have never been,so dizzying,,as they should be, for a pioneering city.,Risks that really move architecture,even with all its flaws, into a space which is much better,that the ever again repeated,hollowness of a ready-made thing. 
 And of course that is finally what I believe architecture to be.,It's about space. It's not about fashion.,It's not about decoration.,It's about creating with minimal means,something which can not be repeated,,cannot be simulated in any other sphere.,And there of course is the space that we need to breathe,,is the space we need to dream.,These are the spaces that are,not just luxurious spaces for some of us,,but are important for everybody in this world. 
 So again, it's not about the changing fashions, changing theories.,It's about carving out a space for trees.,It's carving out a space where nature can enter,the domestic world of a city.,A space where something which has never seen a light of day,can enter into the inner workings of a density.,And I think that is really the nature of architecture. 
 Now I am a believer in democracy.,I don't like beautiful buildings,built for totalitarian regimes.,Where people cannot speak, cannot vote, cannot do anything.,We too often admire those buildings. We think they are beautiful.,And yet when I think of the poverty of society,which doesn't give freedom to its people,,I don't admire those buildings.,So democracy, as difficult as it is, I believe in it. 
 And of course, at Ground Zero what else?,It's such a complex project.,It's emotional. There is so many interests.,It's political. There is so many parties to this project.,There is so many interests. There's money. There's political power.,There are emotions of the victims.,And yet, in all its messiness, in all its difficulties,,I would not have liked somebody to say,,"This is the tabula rasa, mister architect -- do whatever you want.",I think nothing good will come out of that. 
 I think architecture is about consensus.,And it is about the dirty word "compromise." Compromise is not bad.,Compromise, if it's artistic,,if it is able to cope with its strategies --,and there is my first sketch and the last rendering --,it's not that far away.,And yet, compromise, consensus,,that is what I believe in.,And Ground Zero, despite all its difficulties, it's moving forward.,It's difficult. 2011, 2013. Freedom Tower, the memorial.,And that is where I end. 
 I was inspired when I came here as an immigrant,on a ship like millions of others,,looking at America from that point of view.,This is America. This is liberty.,This is what we dream about. Its individuality,,demonstrated in the skyline. It's resilience.,And finally, it's the freedom that America represents,,not just to me, as an immigrant, but to everyone in the world. Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: I've got a question.,So have you come to peace,with the process that happened at Ground Zero,and the loss of the original, incredible design that you came up with? 
 Daniel Libeskind: Look. We have to cure ourselves,of the notion that we are authoritarian,,that we can determine everything that happens.,We have to rely on others, and shape the process in the best way possible.,I came from the Bronx. I was taught not to be a loser,,not to be somebody who just gives up in a fight.,You have to fight for what you believe. You don't always win,everything you want to win. But you can steer the process.,And I believe that what will be built at Ground Zero,will be meaningful, will be inspiring,,will tell other generations of the sacrifices,,of the meaning of this event.,Not just for New York, but for the world. 
 Chris Anderson: Thank you so much, Daniel Libeskind. 
 (Applause)I want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid,,playing with blocks.,As you figured out how to reach out and grasp,,pick them up and move them around,,you were actually learning how to think and solve problems,by understanding and manipulating spatial relationships.,Spatial reasoning is deeply connected,to how we understand a lot of the world around us. 
 So, as a computer scientist,inspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects --,along with my adviser Pattie, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi --,I started to wonder -- what if when we used a computer,,instead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital fingertip,moving around a flat desktop,,what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically,,arranging it the way we wanted?,This question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer,,by building Siftables. 
 In a nutshell, a Siftable is an interactive computer,the size of a cookie.,They're able to be moved around by hand,,they can sense each other, they can sense their motion,,and they have a screen and a wireless radio.,Most importantly, they're physical,,so like the blocks, you can move them just by reaching out and grasping.,And Siftables are an example of a new ecosystem,of tools for manipulating digital information.,And as these tools become more physical,,more aware of their motion, aware of each other,,and aware of the nuance of how we move them,,we can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles.,So, I'm going to start with some simple examples. 
 This Siftable is configured to show video,,and if I tilt it in one direction, it'll roll the video this way;,if I tilt it the other way it rolls it backwards.,And these interactive portraits are aware of each other.,So if I put them next to each other, they get interested.,If they get surrounded, they notice that too,,they might get a little flustered.,And they can also sense their motion and tilt. 
 One of the interesting implications on interaction, we started to realize,,was that we could use everyday gestures on data,,like pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid.,So in this case, we've got three Siftables configured to be paint buckets,and I can use them to pour color into that central one,,where they get mixed.,If we overshoot, we can pour a little bit back. 
 There are also some neat possibilities for education,,like language, math and logic games,where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly,,and view the results immediately.,So here I'm --,(Applause),This is a Fibonacci sequence that I'm making with a simple equation program. 
 Here we have a word game that's kind of like a mash-up between Scrabble and Boggle.,Basically, in every round,you get a randomly assigned letter on each Siftable,,and as you try to make words it checks against a dictionary.,Then, after about 30 seconds, it reshuffles,,and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try. 
 (Applause),Thank you.,(Applause) 
 So these are some kids that came on a field trip to the Media Lab,,and I managed to get them to try it out, and shoot a video.,They really loved it.,And, one of the interesting things about this kind of application,is that you don't have to give people many instructions.,All you have to say is, "Make words,",and they know exactly what to do. 
 So here's another few people trying it out.,That's our youngest beta tester, down there on the right.,Turns out, all he wanted to do was to stack the Siftables up.,So to him, they were just blocks.,Now, this is an interactive cartoon application.,And we wanted to build a learning tool for language learners.,And this is Felix, actually.,And he can bring new characters into the scene,,just by lifting the Siftables off the table that have that character shown on them.,Here, he's bringing the sun out. 
 Video: The sun is rising. 
 David Merrill: Now he's brought a tractor into the scene. 
 Video: The orange tractor.,Good job! Yeah! 
 DM: So by shaking the Siftables and putting them next to each other,he can make the characters interact -- 
 Video: Woof! 
 DM: inventing his own narrative. 
 Video: Hello! 
 DM: It's an open-ended story,,and he gets to decide how it unfolds. 
 Video: Fly away, cat. 
 DM: So, the last example I have time to show you today,is a music sequencing and live performance tool,that we've built recently,,in which Siftables act as sounds,like lead, bass and drums.,Each of these has four different variations,,you get to choose which one you want to use.,And you can inject these sounds into a sequence,that you can assemble into the pattern that you want.,And you inject it by just bumping up the sound Siftable against a sequence Siftable.,There are effects that you can control live, like reverb and filter.,You attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it.,And then, overall effects like tempo and volume,that apply to the entire sequence.,So let's have a look. 
 Video: (Music) 
 DM: We'll start by putting a lead,into two sequence Siftables, arrange them into a series,,extend it, add a little more lead.,Now I put a bass line in. 
 Video: (Music),DM: Now I'll put some percussion in.,Video: (Music) 
 DM: And now I'll attach the filter to the drums, so I can control the effect live. 
 Video: (Music) 
 DM: I can speed up the whole sequence,by tilting the tempo one way or the other. 
 Video: (Music) 
 DM: And now I'll attach the filter to the bass for some more expression. 
 Video: (Music) 
 DM: I can rearrange the sequence while it plays.,So I don't have to plan it out in advance, but I can improvise,,making it longer or shorter as I go.,And now, finally, I can fade the whole sequence out,using the volume Siftable, tilted to the left. 
 (Applause),Thank you. 
 So, as you can see,,my passion is for making new human-computer interfaces,that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work.,And today, I had time to show you one point in this new design space,,and a few of the possibilities that we're working to bring out of the laboratory.,So the thought I want to leave you with,is that we're on the cusp of this new generation of tools,for interacting with digital media,that are going to bring information into our world,on our terms.,Thank you very much.,I look forward to talking with all of you. 
 (Applause)So I'm here to tell you a story of success from Africa.,A year and a half ago,,four of the five people who are full time members,at Ushahidi,,which means "testimony" in Swahili,,were TED Fellows.,A year ago in Kenya we had post-election violence.,And in that time we prototyped and built,,in about three days, a system that would allow,anybody with a mobile phone,to send in information and reports on what was happening around them.,We took what we knew about Africa,,the default device,,the mobile phone, as our common denominator,,and went from there.,We got reports like this.,This is just a couple of them from January 17th, last year.,And our system was rudimentary. It was very basic.,It was a mash-up that used data that we collected from people,,and we put it on our map. 
 But then we decided we needed to do something more.,We needed to take what we had built,and create a platform out of it so that it could be used elsewhere in the world.,And so there is a team of developers,from all over Africa, who are part of this team now --,from Ghana, from Malawi, from Kenya.,There is even some from the U.S.,We're building for smartphones, so that it can be used in the developed world,,as well as the developing world. 
 We are realizing that this is true.,If it works in Africa then it will work anywhere.,And so we build for it in Africa first,and then we move to the edges.,It's now been deployed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.,It's being used by NGOs all over East Africa,,small NGOs doing their own little projects.,Just this last month it was deployed by,Al Jazeera in Gaza.,But that's actually not what I'm here to talk about. 
 I'm here to talk about the next big thing,,because what we're finding out is that,we have this capacity to report,eyewitness accounts of what's going on in real time.,We're seeing this in events like Mumbai recently,,where it's so much easier to report now,than it is to consume it.,There is so much information; what do you do?,This is the Twitter reports for over three days,just covering Mumbai.,How do you decide what is important?,What is the veracity level of what you're looking at?,So what we find is that there is this,great deal of wasted crisis information,because there is just too much information for us to,actually do anything with right now.,And what we're actually really concerned with,is this first three hours.,What we are looking at is the first three hours.,How do we deal with that information that is coming in?,You can't understand what is actually happening.,On the ground and around the world,people are still curious,,and trying to figure out what is going on. But they don't know. 
 So what we built of course, Ushahidi,,is crowdsourcing this information.,You see this with Twitter, too. You get this information overload.,So you've got a lot of information. That's great.,But now what?,So we think that there is something interesting we can do here.,And we have a small team who is working on this.,We think that we can actually create,a crowdsourced filter.,Take the crowd and apply them to the information.,And by rating it and by rating,the different people who submit information,,we can get refined results,and weighted results.,So that we have a better understanding,of the probability of something being true or not.,This is the kind of innovation that is,,quite frankly -- it's interesting that it's coming from Africa.,It's coming from places that you wouldn't expect.,From young, smart developers.,And it's a community around it that has decided to build this.,So, thank you very much.,And we are very happy to be part of the TED family.,(Applause)This is the exact moment,that I started creating something called Tinkering School. 
 Tinkering School is a place where kids can pick up sticks,and hammers and other dangerous objects,,and be trusted.,Trusted not to hurt themselves,,and trusted not to hurt others.,Tinkering School doesn't follow a set curriculum,,and there are no tests.,We're not trying to teach anybody any specific thing. 
 When the kids arrive,they're confronted with lots of stuff:,wood and nails and rope and wheels,,and lots of tools, real tools.,It's a six-day immersive experience for the kids.,And within that context, we can offer the kids time --,something that seems in short supply,in their over-scheduled lives.,Our goal is to ensure that they leave,with a better sense of how to make things,than when they arrived,,and the deep internal realization,that you can figure things out by fooling around. 
 Nothing ever turns out as planned ... ever.,(Laughter),And the kids soon learn,that all projects go awry --,(Laughter),and become at ease with the idea that every step,in a project is a step closer,to sweet success,,or gleeful calamity.,We start from doodles and sketches.,And sometimes we make real plans.,And sometimes we just start building.,Building is at the heart of the experience:,hands on, deeply immersed,and fully committed to the problem at hand.,Robin and I, acting as collaborators,,keep the landscape of the projects,tilted towards completion.,Success is in the doing,,and failures are celebrated and analyzed.,Problems become puzzles,and obstacles disappear. 
 When faced with particularly difficult,setbacks or complexities,,a really interesting behavior emerges: decoration.,(Laughter),Decoration of the unfinished project,is a kind of conceptual incubation.,From these interludes come deep insights,and amazing new approaches to solving the problems,that had them frustrated just moments before. 
 All materials are available for use.,Even those mundane, hateful, plastic grocery bags,can become a bridge,stronger than anyone imagined.,And the things that they build,amaze even themselves.

 GT: Thank you. It's been a great pleasure.,(Applause)(Applause),AIDS was discovered 1981; the virus, 1983.,These Gapminder bubbles show you,how the spread of the virus was in 1983 in the world,,or how we estimate that it was.,What we are showing here is --,on this axis here, I'm showing percent of infected adults.,And on this axis, I'm showing dollars per person in income.,And the size of these bubbles, the size of the bubbles here,,that shows how many are infected in each country,,and the color is the continent. 
 Now, you can see United States, in 1983,,had a very low percentage infected,,but due to the big population, still a sizable bubble.,There were quite many people infected in the United States.,And, up there, you see Uganda.,They had almost five percent infected,,and quite a big bubble in spite of being a small country, then.,And they were probably the most infected country in the world.,Now, what has happened?,Now you have understood the graph,and now, in the next 60 seconds,,we will play the HIV epidemic in the world. 
 But first, I have a new invention here.,(Laughter),I have solidified the beam of the laser pointer. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 So, ready, steady, go!,First, we have the fast rise in Uganda and Zimbabwe.,They went upwards like this.,In Asia, the first country to be heavily infected was Thailand --,they reached one to two percent.,Then, Uganda started to turn back,,whereas Zimbabwe skyrocketed,,and some years later South Africa had a terrible rise of HIV frequency.,Look, India got many infected,,but had a low level.,And almost the same happens here.,See, Uganda coming down, Zimbabwe coming down,,Russia went to one percent. 
 In the last two to three years,,we have reached a steady state of HIV epidemic in the world.,25 years it took.,But, steady state doesn't mean that things are getting better,,it's just that they have stopped getting worse.,And it has -- the steady state is, more or less,,one percent of the adult world population is HIV-infected.,It means 30 to 40 million people,,the whole of California -- every person,,that's more or less what we have today in the world. 
 Now, let me make a fast replay of Botswana.,Botswana -- upper middle-income country in southern Africa,,democratic government, good economy,,and this is what happened there.,They started low, they skyrocketed,,they peaked up there in 2003,,and now they are down.,But they are falling only slowly,,because in Botswana, with good economy and governance,,they can manage to treat people.,And if people who are infected are treated, they don't die of AIDS.,These percentages won't come down,because people can survive 10 to 20 years.,So there's some problem with these metrics now.,But the poorer countries in Africa, the low-income countries down here,,there the rates fall faster, of the percentage infected,,because people still die.,In spite of PEPFAR, the generous PEPFAR,,all people are not reached by treatment,,and of those who are reached by treatment in the poor countries,,only 60 percent are left on treatment after two years.,It's not realistic with lifelong treatment,for everyone in the poorest countries.,But it's very good that what is done is being done. 
 But focus now is back on prevention.,It is only by stopping the transmission,that the world will be able to deal with it.,Drugs is too costly -- had we had the vaccine,,or when we will get the vaccine, that's something more effective --,but the drugs are very costly for the poor.,Not the drug in itself, but the treatment,and the care which is needed around it.,So, when we look at the pattern,,one thing comes out very clearly:,you see the blue bubbles,and people say HIV is very high in Africa.,I would say, HIV is very different in Africa.,You'll find the highest HIV rate in the world,in African countries,,and yet you'll find Senegal, down here --,the same rate as United States.,And you'll find Madagascar,,and you'll find a lot of African countries,about as low as the rest of the world.,It's this terrible simplification that there's one Africa,and things go on in one way in Africa.,We have to stop that.,It's not respectful, and it's not very clever,to think that way. 
 (Applause) 
 I had the fortune to live and work for a time in the United States.,I found out that Salt Lake City and San Francisco were different.,(Laughter),And so it is in Africa -- it's a lot of difference.,So, why is it so high? Is it war?,No, it's not. Look here.,War-torn Congo is down there -- two, three, four percent.,And this is peaceful Zambia, neighboring country -- 15 percent.,And there's good studies of the refugees coming out of Congo --,they have two, three percent infected,,and peaceful Zambia -- much higher.,There are now studies clearly showing,that the wars are terrible, that rapes are terrible,,but this is not the driving force for the high levels in Africa. 
 So, is it poverty?,Well if you look at the macro level,,it seems more money, more HIV.,But that's very simplistic,,so let's go down and look at Tanzania.,I will split Tanzania in five income groups,,from the highest income to the lowest income,,and here we go.,The ones with the highest income, the better off -- I wouldn't say rich --,they have higher HIV.,The difference goes from 11 percent down to four percent,,and it is even bigger among women.,There's a lot of things that we thought, that now, good research,,done by African institutions and researchers,together with the international researchers, show that that's not the case.,So, this is the difference within Tanzania. 
 And, I can't avoid showing Kenya.,Look here at Kenya.,I've split Kenya in its provinces.,Here it goes.,See the difference within one African country --,it goes from very low level to very high level,,and most of the provinces in Kenya is quite modest. 
 So, what is it then?,Why do we see this extremely high levels in some countries?,Well, it is more common with multiple partners,,there is less condom use,,and there is age-disparate sex --,that is, older men tend to have sex with younger women.,We see higher rates in younger women than younger men,in many of these highly affected countries. 
 But where are they situated?,I will swap the bubbles to a map.,Look, the highly infected are four percent of all population,and they hold 50 percent of the HIV-infected.,HIV exists all over the world.,Look, you have bubbles all over the world here.,Brazil has many HIV-infected.,Arab countries not so much, but Iran is quite high.,They have heroin addiction and also prostitution in Iran.,India has many because they are many.,Southeast Asia, and so on.,But, there is one part of Africa --,and the difficult thing is, at the same time,,not to make a uniform statement about Africa,,not to come to simple ideas of why it is like this, on one hand. 
 On the other hand, try to say that this is not the case,,because there is a scientific consensus about this pattern now.,UNAIDS have done good data available, finally,,about the spread of HIV.,It could be concurrency.,It could be some virus types.,It could be that there is other things,which makes transmission occur in a higher frequency.,After all, if you are completely healthy and you have heterosexual sex,,the risk of infection in one intercourse is one in 1,000.,Don't jump to conclusions now on how to,behave tonight and so on.,(Laughter),But -- and if you are in an unfavorable situation,,more sexually transmitted diseases, it can be one in 100. 
 But what we think is that it could be concurrency.,And what is concurrency?,In Sweden, we have no concurrency.,We have serial monogamy.,Vodka, New Year's Eve -- new partner for the spring.,Vodka, Midsummer's Eve -- new partner for the fall.,Vodka -- and it goes on like this, you know?,And you collect a big number of exes.,And we have a terrible chlamydia epidemic --,terrible chlamydia epidemic which sticks around for many years.,HIV has a peak three to six weeks after infection,and therefore, having more than one partner in the same month,is much more dangerous for HIV than others.,Probably, it's a combination of this. 
 And what makes me so happy is that we are moving now,towards fact when we look at this.,You can get this chart, free.,We have uploaded UNAIDS data on the Gapminder site.,And we hope that when we act on global problems in the future,we will not only have the heart,,we will not only have the money,,but we will also use the brain. 
 Thank you very much.

 Herbie Hancock: Thank you.,Marcus Miller. (Applause),Harvey Mason. (Applause) 
 Thank you. Thank you very much. (Applause)This is a world-changing invention.,The smoke alarm has saved perhaps hundreds of thousands,of lives, worldwide.,But smoke alarms don't prevent fires. 
 Every year in the USA, over 20,000 are killed or injured,with 350,000 home fires.,And one of the main causes of all these fires is electricity.,What if we could prevent electrical fires,before they start?,Well, a couple of friends and I figured out how to do this. 
 So how does electricity ignite residential fires?,Well it turns out that the main causes,are faulty and misused appliances and electrical wiring.,Our invention had to address all of these issues.,So what about circuit breakers?,Well, Thomas Edison invented the circuit breaker in 1879.,This is 130-year-old technology,,and this is a problem, because over 80 percent,of all home electrical fires,start below the safety threshold of circuit breakers.,Hmmm ... 
 So we considered all of this. And we realized,that electrical appliances,must be able to communicate directly,with the power receptacle itself.,Any electrical device -- an appliance, an extension cord, whatever --,must be able to tell the power outlet,,"Hey, power outlet,,I'm drawing too much current. Shut me off now, before I start a fire.",And the power outlet needs to be smart enough to do it.,So here is what we did. We put a 10-cent digital transponder,,a data tag, in the appliance plug.,And we put an inexpensive, wireless data reader inside the receptacle,so they could communicate.,Now, every home electrical system,becomes an intelligent network.,The appliance's safe operating parameters,are embedded into its plug.,If too much current is flowing,,the intelligent receptacle turns itself off,,and prevents another fire from starting.,We call this technology EFCI,,Electrical Fault Circuit Interrupter. 
 Okay, two more points. Every year in the USA,,roughly 2,500 children,are admitted to emergency rooms for shock and burn injuries,related to electrical receptacles. And this is crazy.,An intelligent receptacle prevents injuries,because the power is always off,,until an intelligent plug is detected. Simple. 
 Now, besides saving lives,,perhaps the greatest benefit of intelligent power,is in its energy savings.,This invention will reduce global energy consumption,by allowing remote control and automation,of every outlet in every home and business.,Now you can choose to reduce your home energy bill,by automatically cycling heavy loads,like air conditioners and heaters.,Hotels and businesses can shut down unused rooms,from a central location, or even a cell phone.,There are 10 billion electrical outlets,in North America alone.,The potential energy savings is very, very significant. 
 So far we've applied for 414 patent claims.,Of those, 186 have been granted:,228 are in process.,And I'm pleased to announce that just three weeks ago,we received our first international recognition,,the 2009 CES Innovation Award.,So, to conclude,,intelligent power can, globally, save thousands of lives,,prevent tens of thousands of injuries,,and eliminate tens of billions of dollars in property damage,every single year,,while significantly reducing global energy consumption.,In the spirit of this year's TED Conference,,we think this is a powerful, world-changing invention.,And I'd like to thank Chris for this opportunity,to unveil our technology with you, and soon the world.,Thank you.,(Applause)All human life,,all life, depends on plants.,Let me try to convince you of that in a few seconds.,Just think for a moment.,It doesn't matter whether you live in a small African village,,or you live in a big city,,everything comes back to plants in the end:,whether it's for the food, the medicine,,the fuel, the construction, the clothing, all the obvious things;,or whether it's for the spiritual and recreational things,that matter to us so much;,or whether it's soil formation,,or the effect on the atmosphere,,or primary production.,Damn it, even the books here are made out of plants.,All these things, they come back to plants.,And without them we wouldn't be here. 
 Now plants are under threat.,They're under threat because of changing climate.,And they are also under threat because they are sharing a planet,with people like us.,And people like us want to do things that destroy plants,,and their habitats.,And whether that's because of food production,,or because of the introduction of alien plants,into places that they really oughtn't be,,or because of habitats being used for other purposes --,all these things are meaning that plants have to adapt,,or die, or move.,And plants sometimes find it rather difficult to move,because there might be cities and other things in the way. 
 So if all human life depends on plants,,doesn't it make sense that perhaps we should try to save them?,I think it does.,And I want to tell you about a project to save plants.,And the way that you save plants,is by storing seeds.,Because seeds, in all their diverse glory,,are plants' futures.,All the genetic information for future generations of plants,are held in seeds.,So here is the building;,it looks rather unassuming, really.,But it goes down below ground many stories.,And it's the largest seed bank in the world.,It exists not only in southern England,,but distributed around the world. I'll come to that.,This is a nuclear-proof facility.,God forbid that it should have to withstand that. 
 So if you're going to build a seed bank, you have to decide,what you're going to store in it. Right?,And we decided that what we want to store first of all,,are the species that are most under threat.,And those are the dry land species.,So first of all we did deals,with 50 different countries.,It means negotiating with heads of state,,and with secretaries of state in 50 countries,to sign treaties.,We have 120 partner institutions all over the world,,in all those countries colored orange.,People come from all over the world to learn,,and then they go away and plan exactly how,they're going to collect these seeds.,They have thousands of people all over the world,tagging places where those plants are said to exist.,They search for them. They find them in flower.,And they go back when their seeds have arrived.,And they collect the seeds. All over the world. 
 The seeds -- some of if is very untechnical.,You kind of shovel them all in to bags and dry them off.,You label them. You do some high-tech things here and there,,some low-tech things here and there.,And the main thing is that you have to dry them,very carefully, at low temperature.,And then you have to store them,at about minus 20 degrees C --,that's about minus four Fahrenheit, I think --,with a very critically low moisture content.,And these seeds will be able to germinate,,we believe, with many of the species,,in thousands of years,,and certainly in hundreds of years. 
 It's no good storing the seeds if you don't know they're still viable.,So every 10 years we do germination tests,on every sample of seeds that we have.,And this is a distributed network.,So all around the world people are doing the same thing.,And that enables us to develop germination protocols.,That means that we know the right combination of heat,and cold and the cycles that you have to get,to make the seed germinate.,And that is very useful information.,And then we grow these things,,and we tell people, back in the countries where these seeds have come from,,"Look, actually we're not just storing this,to get the seeds later,,but we can give you this information about,how to germinate these difficult plants.",And that's already happening. 
 So where have we got to?,I am pleased to unveil that our three billionth seed --,that's three thousand millionth seed --,is now stored.,Ten percent of all plant species on the planet,,24,000 species are safe;,30,000 species, if we get the funding, by next year.,Twenty-five percent of all the world's plants, by 2020.,These are not just crop plants,,as you might have seen stored in Svalbard in Norway --,fantastic work there.,This is at least 100 times bigger.,We have thousands of collections that have been sent out,all over the world:,drought-tolerant forest species sent to Pakistan and Egypt;,especially photosynthetic-efficient plants,come here to the United States;,salt-tolerant pasture species sent to Australia;,the list goes on and on. 
 These seeds are used for restoration.,So in habitats that have already been damaged,,like the tall grass prairie here in the USA,,or in mined land in various countries,,restoration is already happening because of these species --,and because of this collection.,Some of these plants, like the ones on the bottom,to the left of your screen,,they are down to the last few remaining members.,The one where the guy is collecting seeds there on the truck,,that is down to about 30 last remaining trees.,Fantastically useful plant,,both for protein and for medicine. 
 We have training going on in China, in the USA,,and many other countries.,How much does it cost?,2,800 dollars per species is the average.,I think that's cheap, at the price.,And that gets you all the scientific data,that goes with it.,The future research is "How can we find,the genetic and molecular markers,for the viability of seeds,,without having to plant them every 10 years?",And we're almost there.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)What's happening to the climate?,It is unbelievably bad.,This is, obviously, that famous view now of the Arctic,,which is likely to be gone at this point,in the next three or four or five years. Very, very, very scary. 
 So we all look at what we can do.,And when you look at the worldwide sources of CO2,,52 percent are tied to buildings.,Only nine percent is passenger cars, interestingly enough.,So we ran off to a sushi bar.,And at that sushi bar we came up with a great idea.,And it was something called EcoRock.,And we said we could redesign the 115-year-old,gypsum drywall process that generates,20 billion pounds of CO2 a year.,So it was a big idea. We wanted to reduce that by 80 percent,,which is exactly what we've done. 
 We started R&D in 2006.,Decided to use recycled content from cement,and steel manufacturing.,There is the inside of our lab. We haven't shown this before.,But our people had to do some 5,000,different mixes to get this right, to hit our targets.,And they worked absolutely very, very, very hard.,So then we went forward and built our production line in China.,We don't build this production equipment any longer in the U.S., unfortunately. 
 We did the line install over the summer.,We started right there, with absolutely nothing.,You're seeing for the first time, a brand new drywall production line,,not made using gypsum at all.,That's the finished production line there.,We got our first panel out on December third.,That is the slurry being poured onto paper, basically. That's the line running.,The exciting thing is, look at the faces of the people.,These are people who worked this project for two to three years.,And they are so excited. That's the first board off the line.,Our Vice President of Operation kissing the board. Obviously very, very excited. 
 But this has a huge, huge impact on the environment.,We signed the first panel just a few weeks after that, had a great signing ceremony,,leading to people hopefully using these products across the world.,And we've got Cradle-to-Cradle Gold on this thing.,We happened to win, just recently, the Green Product of the Year,for "The Re-Invention of Drywall," from Popular Science.,Thank you. Thank you.,So here is what we learned: 8,000 gallons of gas,equivalent to build one house.,You probably had no idea. It's like driving around the world six times. 
 We must change everything.,Look around the room: chairs, wood,,everything around us has to change or we're not going to lick this problem.,Don't listen to the people who say you can't do this, because anyone can.,And these job losses, we can fix them with green-collar jobs.,We've got four plants. We're building this stuff around the country.,We're going as fast as we can.,Two and a half million cars worth of gypsum,,you know, CO2 generated. Right?,So what will you do? I'll tell you what I did and why I did it. And I know my time's up. 
 Those are my kids, Natalie and David.,When they have their kids, 2050,,they'd better look back at Grandpa and say,,"Hey, you gave it a good shot. You did the best you could,with the team that you had.",So my hope is that when you leave TED,,you will look at reducing your carbon footprint,in however you can do it.,And if you don't know how, please find me -- I will help you. 
 Last but not least, Bill Gates, I know you invented Windows.,Wait till you see, maybe next year, what kind of windows we've invented.,Thank you so much.,(Applause)I'm here today, as June said,,to talk about a project,that my twin sister and I have been doing for the past three and half years.,We're crocheting a coral reef.,And it's a project that we've actually,been now joined by hundreds of people around the world,,who are doing it with us. Indeed thousands of people,have actually been involved in this project,,in many of its different aspects.,It's a project that now reaches across three continents,,and its roots go into the fields of mathematics,,marine biology, feminine handicraft,and environmental activism.,It's true.,It's also a project,that in a very beautiful way,,the development of this,has actually paralleled the evolution of life on earth,,which is a particularly lovely thing to be saying,right here in February 2009 --,which, as one of our previous speakers told us,,is the 200th anniversary,of the birth of Charles Darwin. 
 All of this I'm going to get to in the next 18 minutes, I hope.,But let me first begin by showing you,some pictures of what this thing looks like.,Just to give you an idea of scale,,that installation there is about six feet across,,and the tallest models are about two or three feet high.,This is some more images of it.,That one on the right is about five feet high.,The work involves hundreds of different crochet models.,And indeed there are now thousands and thousands of models that people,have contributed all over the world as part of this.,The totality of this project,involves tens of thousands of hours,of human labor --,99 percent of it done by women.,On the right hand side, that bit there is part of an installation,that is about 12 feet long. 
 My sister and I started this project in 2005,because in that year, at least in the science press,,there was a lot of talk about global warming,,and the effect that global warming was having on coral reefs.,Corals are very delicate organisms,,and they are devastated by any rise in sea temperatures.,It causes these vast bleaching events,that are the first signs of corals of being sick.,And if the bleaching doesn't go away --,if the temperatures don't go down -- reefs start to die.,A great deal of this has been happening in the Great Barrier Reef,,particularly in coral reefs all over the world.,This is our invocation in crochet of a bleached reef. 
 We have a new organization together called The Institute for Figuring,,which is a little organization we started,to promote, to do projects about the,aesthetic and poetic dimensions of science and mathematics.,And I went and put a little announcement up on our site,,asking for people to join us in this enterprise.,To our surprise, one of the first people who called,was the Andy Warhol Museum.,And they said they were having an exhibition,about artists' response to global warming,,and they'd like our coral reef to be part of it.,I laughed and said, "Well we've only just started it,,you can have a little bit of it.",So in 2007 we had an exhibition,,a small exhibition of this crochet reef.,And then some people in Chicago came along and they said,,"In late 2007, the theme of the Chicago Humanities Festival is,global warming. And we've got this 3,000 square-foot gallery,and we want you to fill it with your reef.",And I, naively by this stage, said, "Oh, yes, sure.",Now I say "naively" because actually,my profession is as a science writer.,What I do is I write books about the cultural history of physics.,I've written books about the history of space,,the history of physics and religion,,and I write articles for people like the New York Times and the L.A. Times.,So I had no idea what it meant to fill a 3,000 square-foot gallery.,So I said yes to this proposition.,And I went home, and I told my sister Christine.,And she nearly had a fit,because Christine is a professor at one of,L.A.'s major art colleges, CalArts,,and she knew exactly what it meant to fill a 3,000 square-foot gallery.,She thought I'd gone off my head.,But she went into crochet overdrive.,And to cut a long story short, eight months later,we did fill the Chicago Cultural Center's,3,000 square foot gallery. 
 By this stage the project had taken on,a viral dimension of its own,,which got completely beyond us.,The people in Chicago decided,that as well as exhibiting our reefs, what they wanted to do,was have the local people there make a reef.,So we went and taught the techniques. We did workshops and lectures.,And the people in Chicago made a reef of their own.,And it was exhibited alongside ours.,There were hundreds of people involved in that.,We got invited to do the whole thing,in New York, and in London,,and in Los Angeles.,In each of these cities, the local citizens,,hundreds and hundreds of them, have made a reef.,And more and more people get involved in this,,most of whom we've never met.,So the whole thing has sort of morphed,into this organic, ever-evolving creature,,that's actually gone way beyond Christine and I. 
 Now some of you are sitting here thinking,,"What planet are these people on?,Why on earth are you crocheting a reef?,Woolenness and wetness aren't exactly,two concepts that go together.,Why not chisel a coral reef out of marble?,Cast it in bronze.",But it turns out there is a very good reason,why we are crocheting it,because many organisms in coral reefs,have a very particular kind of structure.,The frilly crenulated forms that you see,in corals, and kelps, and sponges and nudibranchs,,is a form of geometry known as hyperbolic geometry.,And the only way that mathematicians know,how to model this structure,is with crochet. It happens to be a fact.,It's almost impossible to model this structure any other way,,and it's almost impossible to do it on computers.,So what is this hyperbolic geometry,that corals and sea slugs embody? 
 The next few minutes is, we're all going to get raised up,to the level of a sea slug.,(Laughter),This sort of geometry revolutionized mathematics,when it was first discovered in the 19th century.,But not until 1997 did mathematicians actually understand,how they could model it.,In 1997 a mathematician,at Cornell, Daina Taimina,,made the discovery that this structure,could actually be done in knitting and crochet.,The first one she did was knitting.,But you get too many stitches on the needle. So she quickly realized,crochet was the better thing.,But what she was doing was actually making a model,of a mathematical structure, that many mathematicians,had thought it was actually impossible to model.,And indeed they thought that anything like this structure,was impossible per se.,Some of the best mathematicians spent hundreds of years,trying to prove that this structure was impossible. 
 So what is this impossible hyperbolic structure?,Before hyperbolic geometry, mathematicians knew,about two kinds of space:,Euclidean space, and spherical space.,And they have different properties.,Mathematicians like to characterize things by being formalist.,You all have a sense of what a flat space is, Euclidean space is.,But mathematicians formalize this in a particular way.,And what they do is, they do it through the concept,of parallel lines.,So here we have a line and a point outside the line.,And Euclid said, "How can I define parallel lines?,I ask the question, how many lines can I draw through,the point but never meet the original line?",And you all know the answer. Does someone want to shout it out?,One. Great. Okay.,That's our definition of a parallel line.,It's a definition really of Euclidean space. 
 But there is another possibility that you all know of:,spherical space.,Think of the surface of a sphere --,just like a beach ball, the surface of the Earth.,I have a straight line on my spherical surface.,And I have a point outside the line. How many straight lines,can I draw through the point,but never meet the original line?,What do we mean to talk about,a straight line on a curved surface?,Now mathematicians have answered that question.,They've understood there is a generalized concept,of straightness, it's called a geodesic.,And on the surface of a sphere,,a straight line is the biggest possible circle you can draw.,So it's like the equator or the lines of longitude.,So we ask the question again,,"How many straight lines can I draw through the point,,but never meet the original line?",Does someone want to guess?,Zero. Very good. 
 Now mathematicians thought that was the only alternative.,It's a bit suspicious isn't it? There is two answers to the question so far,,Zero and one.,Two answers? There may possibly be a third alternative.,To a mathematician if there are two answers,,and the first two are zero and one,,there is another number that immediately suggests itself,as the third alternative.,Does anyone want to guess what it is?,Infinity. You all got it right. Exactly.,There is, there's a third alternative.,This is what it looks like.,There's a straight line, and there is an infinite number of lines,that go through the point and never meet the original line.,This is the drawing.,This nearly drove mathematicians bonkers,because, like you, they're sitting there feeling bamboozled.,Thinking, how can that be? You're cheating. The lines are curved.,But that's only because I'm projecting it onto a,flat surface.,Mathematicians for several hundred years,had to really struggle with this.,How could they see this?,What did it mean to actually have a physical model,that looked like this? 
 It's a bit like this: imagine that we'd only ever encountered Euclidean space.,Then our mathematicians come along,and said, "There's this thing called a sphere,,and the lines come together at the north and south pole.",But you don't know what a sphere looks like.,And someone that comes along and says, "Look here's a ball.",And you go, "Ah! I can see it. I can feel it.,I can touch it. I can play with it.",And that's exactly what happened,when Daina Taimina,in 1997, showed that you could crochet models,in hyperbolic space.,Here is this diagram in crochetness.,I've stitched Euclid's parallel postulate on to the surface.,And the lines look curved.,But look, I can prove to you that they're straight,because I can take any one of these lines,,and I can fold along it.,And it's a straight line.,So here, in wool,,through a domestic feminine art,,is the proof that the most famous postulate,in mathematics is wrong.,(Applause) 
 And you can stitch all sorts of mathematical,theorems onto these surfaces.,The discovery of hyperbolic space ushered in the field of mathematics,that is called non-Euclidean geometry.,And this is actually the field of mathematics,that underlies general relativity,and is actually ultimately going to show us,about the shape of the universe.,So there is this direct line,between feminine handicraft,,Euclid and general relativity. 
 Now, I said that mathematicians thought that this was impossible.,Here's two creatures who've never heard of Euclid's parallel postulate --,didn't know it was impossible to violate,,and they're simply getting on with it.,They've been doing it for hundreds of millions of years.,I once asked the mathematicians why it was,that mathematicians thought this structure was impossible,when sea slugs have been doing it since the Silurian age.,Their answer was interesting.,They said, "Well I guess there aren't that many mathematicians,sitting around looking at sea slugs.",And that's true. But it also goes deeper than that.,It also says a whole lot of things,about what mathematicians thought mathematics was,,what they thought it could and couldn't do,,what they thought it could and couldn't represent.,Even mathematicians, who in some sense,are the freest of all thinkers,,literally couldn't see,not only the sea slugs around them,,but the lettuce on their plate --,because lettuces, and all those curly vegetables,,they also are embodiments of hyperbolic geometry.,And so in some sense they literally,,they had such a symbolic view of mathematics,,they couldn't actually see what was going on,on the lettuce in front of them.,It turns out that the natural world is full of hyperbolic wonders. 
 And so, too, we've discovered,that there is an infinite taxonomy,of crochet hyperbolic creatures.,We started out, Chrissy and I and our contributors,,doing the simple mathematically perfect models.,But we found that when we deviated from the specific,setness of the mathematical code,that underlies it -- the simple algorithm,crochet three, increase one --,when we deviated from that and made embellishments to the code,,the models immediately started to look more natural.,And all of our contributors, who are an amazing,collection of people around the world,,do their own embellishments.,As it were, we have this ever-evolving,,crochet taxonomic tree of life.,Just as the morphology,and the complexity of life on earth is never ending,,little embellishments and complexifications,in the DNA code,lead to new things like giraffes, or orchids --,so too, do little embellishments in the crochet code,lead to new and wondrous creatures,in the evolutionary tree of crochet life.,So this project really has,taken on this inner organic life of its own.,There is the totality of all the people who have come to it.,And their individual visions,,and their engagement with this mathematical mode. 
 We have these technologies. We use them.,But why? What's at stake here? What does it matter?,For Chrissy and I, one of the things that's important here,is that these things suggest,the importance and value of embodied knowledge.,We live in a society,that completely tends to valorize,symbolic forms of representation --,algebraic representations,,equations, codes.,We live in a society that's obsessed,with presenting information in this way,,teaching information in this way.,But through this sort of modality,,crochet, other plastic forms of play --,people can be engaged with the most abstract,,high-powered, theoretical ideas,,the kinds of ideas that normally you have to go,to university departments to study in higher mathematics,,which is where I first learned about hyperbolic space.,But you can do it through playing with material objects.,One of the ways that we've come to think about this,is that what we're trying to do with the Institute for Figuring,and projects like this, we're trying to have,kindergarten for grown-ups. 
 And kindergarten was actually a very formalized,system of education,,established by a man named Friedrich Froebel,,who was a crystallographer in the 19th century.,He believed that the crystal was the model,for all kinds of representation.,He developed a radical alternative system,of engaging the smallest children,with the most abstract ideas,through physical forms of play.,And he is worthy of an entire talk on his own right.,The value of education,is something that Froebel championed,,through plastic modes of play. 
 We live in a society now,where we have lots of think tanks,,where great minds go to think about the world.,They write these great symbolic treatises,called books, and papers,,and op-ed articles.,We want to propose, Chrissy and I,,through The Institute for Figuring, another alternative way of doing things,,which is the play tank.,And the play tank, like the think tank,,is a place where people can go,and engage with great ideas.,But what we want to propose,,is that the highest levels of abstraction,,things like mathematics, computing, logic, etc. --,all of this can be engaged with,,not just through purely cerebral algebraic,symbolic methods,,but by literally, physically playing with ideas.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)Alright.,I'm going to show you a couple of images,from a very diverting papernin The Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine.,I'm going to go way out on a limb and saynthat it is the most diverting paper,ever published innThe Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine.,The title is "Observationsnof In-Utero Masturbation." 
 (Laughter) 
 Okay. Now on the left you can seenthe hand -- that's the big arrow --,and the penis on the right.nThe hand hovering.,And over here we have,,in the words of radiologistnIsrael Meisner,,"The hand grasping the penis in a fashionnresembling masturbation movements.",Bear in mind this was an ultrasound,,so it would have been moving images. 
 Orgasm is a reflexnof the autonomic nervous system.,Now, this is the partnof the nervous system,that deals with the thingsnthat we don't consciously control,,like digestion, heart ratenand sexual arousal.,And the orgasm reflex can be triggerednby a surprisingly broad range of input.,Genital stimulation. Duh.,But also, Kinsey interviewed a woman,who could be brought to orgasmnby having someone stroke her eyebrow.,People with spinal cord injuries,,like paraplegias, quadriplegias,,will often develop a very,nvery sensitive area,right above the level of their injury,,wherever that is.,There is such a thingnas a knee orgasm in the literature. 
 I think the most curious onenthat I came across,was a case report of a woman,who had an orgasm every timenshe brushed her teeth. 
 (Laughter) 
 Something in the complexnsensory-motor action of brushing her teeth,was triggering orgasm.,And she went to a neurologist,nwho was fascinated.,He checked to seenif it was something in the toothpaste,,but no -- it happened with any brand.,They stimulated her gums with a toothpick,nto see if that was doing it.,No. It was the whole, you know, motion.,And the amazing thing to me,is that you would think this womannwould have excellent oral hygiene. 
 (Laughter) 
 Sadly -- this is what it saidnin the journal paper --,"She believed that she wasnpossessed by demons,and switched to mouthwashnfor her oral care.",It's so sad. 
 (Laughter) 
 When I was working on the book,,I interviewed a womannwho can think herself to orgasm.,She was part of a studynat Rutgers University.,You've got to love that. Rutgers.,So I interviewed her in Oakland,nin a sushi restaurant.,And I said, "So, could youndo it right here?",And she said,,"Yeah, but you know I'd rathernfinish my meal if you don't mind." 
 (Laughter) 
 But afterwards, she was kind enoughnto demonstrate on a bench outside.,It was remarkable.nIt took about one minute.,And I said to her,,"Are you just doing this all the time?" 
 (Laughter) 
 She said, "No. Honestly, when I get home,nI'm usually too tired." 
 (Laughter) 
 She said that the last timenshe had done it,was on the Disneyland tram. 
 (Laughter) 
 The headquarters for orgasm,nalong the spinal nerve,,is something called the sacral nerve root,,which is back here.,And if you trigger,nif you stimulate with an electrode,,the precise spot,nyou will trigger an orgasm.,And it is a fact that you can triggernspinal reflexes in dead people --,a certain kind of dead person,na beating-heart cadaver.,Now this is somebody who is brain-dead,,legally dead, definitely checked out,,but is being kept alive on a respirator,,so that their organs will be oxygenatednfor transplantation.,Now in one of these brain-dead people,,if you trigger the right spot,,you will see something every now and then.,There is a reflex callednthe Lazarus reflex.,And this is -- I'll demonstratenas best I can, not being dead.,It's like this. You trigger the spot.,The dead guy, or gal, goes... like that.,Very unsettling for peoplenworking in pathology labs. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, if you can triggernthe Lazarus reflex in a dead person,,why not the orgasm reflex?,I asked this questionnto a brain death expert,,Stephanie Mann, who was foolish enoughnto return my emails. 
 (Laughter) 
 I said, "So, could you conceivablyntrigger an orgasm in a dead person?",She said, "Yes, if the sacral nervenis being oxygenated,,you conceivably could.",Obviously it wouldn't benas much fun for the person.,But it would be an orgasm -- 
 (Laughter) 
 nonetheless. 
 There is a researchernat the University of Alabama,who does orgasm research.,I said to her,n"You should do an experiment.,You know? You can get cadaversnif you work at a university.",I said, "You should actually do this.",She said, "You get the human subjectsnreview board approval for this one." 
 (Laughter) 
 According to 1930s marriage manual author,,Theodoor van De Velde,,a slight seminal odor can be detectednon the breath of a woman,within about an hournafter sexual intercourse.,Theodoor van De Velde was somethingnof a semen connoisseur. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is a guy writing a book,n"Ideal Marriage," you know.,Very heavy hetero guy.,But he wrote in this book,n"Ideal Marriage" --,he said that he could differentiatenbetween the semen of a young man,,which he said had a fresh,nexhilarating smell,,and the semen of mature men,nwhose semen smelled, quote,,"Remarkably like that of the flowersnof the Spanish chestnut.,Sometimes quite freshly floral,,and then again sometimesnextremely pungent." 
 (Laughter) 
 Okay. In 1999, in the state of Israel,na man began hiccupping.,And this was one of those casesnthat went on and on.,He tried everything his friends suggested.,Nothing seemed to help.,Days went by.,At a certain point, the man,nstill hiccupping, had sex with his wife.,And lo and behold, the hiccups went away.,He told his doctor,nwho published a case report,in a Canadian medical journalnunder the title,,"Sexual Intercourse as a PotentialnTreatment for Intractable Hiccups.",I love this article becausenat a certain point they suggested,that unattached hiccuppersncould try masturbation. 
 (Laughter) 
 I love that because there is like a wholendemographic: unattached hiccuppers. 
 (Laughter) 
 Married, single, unattached hiccupper.,In the 1900s, early 1900s,,a lot of gynecologists believednthat when a woman has an orgasm,,the contractions serve to sucknthe semen up through the cervix,and sort of deliver itnreally quickly to the egg,,thereby upping the odds of conception.,It was called the "upsuck" theory. 
 (Laughter) 
 If you go all the way back to Hippocrates,,physicians believed that orgasm in women,was not just helpfulnfor conception, but necessary.,Doctors back thennwere routinely telling men,the importance of pleasuring their wives.,Marriage-manual author and semen-sniffernTheodoor van De Velde -- 
 (Laughter) 
 has a line in his book.,I loved this guy.,I got a lot of mileagenout of Theodoor van De Velde.,He had this line in his book,that supposedly comesnfrom the Habsburg Monarchy,,where there was an empress Maria Theresa,,who was having trouble conceiving.,And apparently the royalncourt physician said to her,,"I am of the opinion that the vulvanof your most sacred majesty,be titillated for some timenprior to intercourse." 
 (Laughter) 
 It's apparently, I don't know,non the record somewhere. 
 Masters and Johnson:,now we're moving forward to the 1950s.,Masters and Johnson were upsuck skeptics,,which is also really fun to say.,They didn't buy it.,And they decided,nbeing Masters and Johnson,,that they would get to the bottom of it.,They brought women into the labn-- I think it was five women --,and outfitted them with cervical capsncontaining artificial semen.,And in the artificial semennwas a radio-opaque substance,,such that it would show up on an X-ray.,This is the 1950s.,Anyway, these womennsat in front of an X-ray device.,And they masturbated.,And Masters and Johnson looked to seenif the semen was being sucked up.,Did not find any evidence of upsuck.,You may be wondering,n"How do you make artificial semen?" 
 (Laughter) 
 I have an answer for you.nI have two answers.,You can use flour and water,nor cornstarch and water.,I actually found threenseparate recipes in the literature. 
 (Laughter) 
 My favorite being the one that says --,you know, they haventhe ingredients listed,,and then in a recipenit will say, for example,,"Yield: two dozen cupcakes.",This one said, "Yield: one ejaculate." 
 (Laughter) 
 There's another way that orgasmnmight boost fertility.,This one involves men.,Sperm that sit around in the bodynfor a week or more,start to develop abnormalities,that make them less effectivenat head-banging their way into the egg.,British sexologist Roy Levinnhas speculated,that this is perhaps why men,evolved to be such enthusiasticnand frequent masturbators.,He said, "If I keep tossing myself offnI get fresh sperm being made.",Which I thoughtnwas an interesting idea, theory.,So now you have an evolutionary excuse. 
 (Laughter) 
 Okay. 
 (Laughter) 
 All righty. There is considerable evidencenfor upsuck in the animal kingdom --,pigs, for instance.,In Denmark, the Danish National Committeenfor Pig Production,found out that if younsexually stimulate a sow,while you artificially inseminate her,,you will see a six-percent increasenin the farrowing rate,,which is the number of piglets produced.,So they came up with this five-pointnstimulation plan for the sows.,There is posters they put in the barn,nand they have a DVD.,And I got a copy of this DVD. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is my unveiling,nbecause I am going to show you a clip. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, okay.,Now, here we go, la la la, off to work.,It all looks very innocent.,He's going to be doing thingsnwith his hands,that the boar would usenhis snout, lacking hands. Okay. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is it.,The boar has a very oddncourtship repertoire. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is to mimic the weight of the boar. 
 (Laughter) 
 You should know, the clitorisnof the pig is inside the vagina.,So this may bensort of titillating for her.,Here we go. 
 (Laughter) 
 And the happy result. 
 (Applause) 
 I love this video.,There is a point in this video,ntowards the beginning,,where they zoom in for a close upnof his hand with his wedding ring,,as if to say,n"It's okay, it's just his job.,He really does like women." 
 (Laughter) 
 Okay. When I was in Denmark,nmy host was named Anne Marie.,And I said, "So why don't you justnstimulate the clitoris of the pig?,Why don't you have the farmers do that?,That's not one of your five steps.",I have to read younwhat she said, because I love it.,She said, "It was a big hurdle,just to get farmers to touchnunderneath the vulva.,So we thought, let's not mentionnthe clitoris right now." 
 (Laughter) 
 Shy but ambitious pig farmers, however,ncan purchase a -- this is true --,a sow vibrator,,that hangs on the spermnfeeder tube to vibrate.,Because, as I mentioned,nthe clitoris is inside the vagina.,So possibly, you know,na little more arousing than it looks.,And I also said to her,,"Now, these sows. I mean,nyou may have noticed there.,The sow doesn't look to benin the throes of ecstasy.",And she said, you can't makenthat conclusion,,because animals don't registernpain or pleasure,on their faces in the same way that we do.,Pigs, for example, are more like dogs.,They use the upper half of the face;nthe ears are very expressive.,So you're not really surenwhat's going on with the pig. 
 Primates, on the other hand,nwe use our mouths more.,This is the ejaculation facenof the stump-tailed macaque. 
 (Laughter) 
 And, interestingly, this has beennobserved in female macaques,,but only when mounting another female. 
 (Laughter) 
 Masters and Johnson.,In the 1950s, they decided,nokay, we're going to figure out,the entire human sexual response cycle,,from arousal, all the way through orgasm,nin men and women --,everything that happens in the human body.,Okay, with women,na lot of this is happening inside.,This did not stop Masters and Johnson.,They developed an artificialncoition machine.,This is basicallyna penis camera on a motor.,There is a phallus,,clear acrylic phallus,nwith a camera and a light source,,attached to a motornthat is kind of going like this.,And the woman would have sex with it.,That is what they would do.nPretty amazing.,Sadly, this device has been dismantled.,This just kills me,nnot because I wanted to use it --,I wanted to see it. 
 (Laughter) 
 One fine day,,Alfred Kinsey decided to calculate,the average distancentraveled by ejaculated semen.,This was not idle curiosity.,Doctor Kinsey had heard --,and there was a theory going aroundnat the time, this being the 1940s --,that the force with whichnsemen is thrown against the cervix,was a factor in fertility.,Kinsey thought it was bunk,nso he got to work.,He got together in his lab,300 men, a measuring tape,nand a movie camera. 
 (Laughter) 
 And in fact, he foundnthat in three quarters of the men,the stuff just kind of slopped out.,It wasn't spurted or thrownnor ejected under great force.,However, the record holder,landed just shy of the eight-foot mark,nwhich is impressive. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Yes. Exactly. 
 (Laughter) 
 Sadly, he's anonymous.nHis name is not mentioned. 
 (Laughter) 
 In his write-upnof this experiment in his book,,Kinsey wrote,,"Two sheets were laid down to protectnthe oriental carpets." 
 (Laughter) 
 Which is my second favorite linenin the entire oeuvre of Alfred Kinsey.,My favorite being, "Cheese crumbsnspread before a pair of copulating rats,will distract the female,nbut not the male." 
 (Laughter) 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Thanks!Trees are wonderful arenas for discovery,because of their tall stature, their complex structure,,the biodiversity they foster and their quiet beauty.,I used to climb trees for fun all the time,and now, as a grown-up, I have made my profession understanding trees,and forests, through the medium of science. 
 The most mysterious part of forests is the upper tree canopy.,And Dr. Terry Erwin, in 1983,,called the canopy, "the last biotic frontier.",I'd like to take you all on a journey up to the forest canopy,,and share with you what canopy researchers are asking,and also how they're communicating with other people outside of science. 
 Let's start our journey on the forest floor,of one of my study sites in Costa Rica.,Because of the overhanging leaves and branches,,you'll notice that the understory is very dark,,it's very still.,And what I'd like to do is take you up to the canopy,,not by putting all of you into ropes and harnesses,,but rather showing you a very short clip,from a National Geographic film called "Heroes of the High Frontier.",This was filmed in Monteverde, Costa Rica,and I think it gives us the best impression of what it's like,to climb a giant strangler fig.,(Music),(Growling),(Rustling) 
 So what you'll see up there is that it's really like the atmosphere of an open field,,and there are tremendous numbers of plants and animals that have adapted,to make their way and their life in the canopy.,Common groups, like the sloth here, have clear adaptations,for forest canopies, hanging on with their very strong claws.,But I'd like to describe to you a more subtle kind of diversity,and tell you about the ants.,There are 10,000 species of ants that taxonomists --,people who describe and name animals -- have named.,4,000 of those ants live exclusively in the forest canopy. 
 One of the reasons I tell you about ants,is because of my husband, who is in fact an ant taxonomist,and when we got married, he promised to name an ant after me, which he did --,Procryptocerus nalini, a canopy ant.,We've had two children, August Andrew and Erika,and actually, he named ants after them.,So we may be the only family that has an ant named after each one of us. 
 But my passion -- in addition to Jack and my children --,are the plants, the so-called epiphytes,,those plants that grow up on trees.,They don't have roots that go into trunks nor to the forest floor.,But rather, it is their leaves that are adapted,to intercept the dissolved nutrients that come to them in the form of mist and fog.,These plants occur in great diversity,,over 28,000 species around the world.,They grow in tropical forests like this one,and they also grow in temperate rainforests, that we find in Washington state. 
 These epiphytes are mainly dominated by the mosses.,One thing I want to point out is that underneath these live epiphytes,,as they die and decompose, they actually construct an arboreal soil,,both in the temperate zone and in the tropics.,And these mosses, generated by decomposing,,are like peat moss in your garden.,They have a tremendous capacity for holding on to nutrients and water. 
 One of the surprising things I discovered,is that, if you pull back with me on those mats of epiphytes,,what you'll find underneath them are connections, networks,of what we call canopy roots.,These are not epiphyte roots:,these are roots that emerge from the trunk and branch of the host trees themselves.,And so those epiphytes are actually paying the landlord a bit of rent,in exchange for being supported high above the forest floor. 
 I was interested, and my canopy researcher colleagues have been interested,in the dynamics of the canopy plants that live in the forest.,We've done stripping experiments,where we've removed mats of epiphytes,and looked at the rates of recolonization.,We had predicted that they would grow back very quickly,and that they would come in encroaching from the side.,What we found, however, was that they took an extremely long time --,over 20 years -- to regenerate,,starting from the bottom and growing up.,And even now, after 25 years,,they're not up there, they have not recolonized completely.,And I use this little image to say,this is what happens to mosses.,If it's gone, it's gone,,and if you're really lucky you might get something growing back from the bottom. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, recolonization is really very slow.,These canopy communities are fragile.,Well, when we look out, you and I, over that canopy,of the intact primary forest,,what we see is this enormous carpet of carbon.,One of the challenges that canopy researchers are attacking today,is trying to understand the amount of carbon that is being sequestered.,We know it's a lot,,but we do not yet know the answers to how much,,and by what processes, carbon is being taken out of the atmosphere,,held in its biomass, and moving on through the ecosystem. 
 So I hope I've showed you that canopy-dwellers,are not just insignificant bits of green up high in the canopy,that Tarzan and Jane were interested in,,but rather that they foster biodiversity,contribute to ecosystem nutrient cycles,,and they also help to keep our global climate stable. 
 Up in the canopy, if you were sitting next to me,and you turned around from those primary forest ecosystems,,you would also see scenes like this.,Scenes of forest destruction, forest harvesting,and forest fragmentation,,thereby making that intact tapestry of the canopy,unable to function in the marvelous ways that it has,when it is not disturbed by humans. 
 I've also looked out on urban places like this,and thought about people who are disassociated from trees in their lives.,People who grew up in a place like this,did not have the opportunity to climb trees and form a relationship with trees,and forests, as I did when I was a young girl.,This troubles me. 
 Here in 2009, you know, it's not an easy thing to be a forest ecologist,,gripping ourselves with these kinds of questions,and trying to figure out how we can answer them.,And especially, you know, as a small brown woman,in a little college, in the upper northwest part of our country,,far away from the areas of power and money,,I really have to ask myself, "What can I do about this?,How can I reconnect people with trees?" 
 Well, I think that I can do something.,I know that as a scientist, I have information,and as a human being, I can communicate with anybody,,inside or outside of academia.,And so, that's what I've begin doing,,and so I'd like to unveil the International Canopy Network here.,We consult to the media about canopy questions;,we have a canopy newsletter;,we have an email LISTSERV.,And so we're trying to disseminate information about the importance of the canopy,,the beauty of the canopy,,the necessity of intact canopies,,to people outside of academia.,We also recognize that a lot of the products that we make --,those videos and so forth --,you know, they don't reach everybody,,and so we've been fostering projects that reach people outside of academia,,and outside of the choir that most ecologists preach to. 
 Treetop Barbie is a great example of that.,What we do, my students in my lab and I,,is we buy Barbies from Goodwill and Value Village,,we dress her in clothes that have been made by seamstresses,and we send her out with a canopy handbook.,And my feeling is -- 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 -- that we've taken this pop icon and we have just tweaked her a little bit,to become an ambassador who can carry the message,that being a woman scientist studying treetops is actually a really great thing. 
 We've also made partnerships with artists,,with people who understand and can communicate the aesthetic beauty,of trees and forest canopies.,And I'd like to just tell you one of our projects,,which is the generation of Canopy Confluences.,What I do is I bring together scientists and artists of all kinds,,and we spend a week in the forest on these little platforms;,and we look at nature, we look at trees, we look at the canopy,,and we communicate, and exchange, and express what we see together.,The results have been fantastic. 
 I'll just give you a few examples.,This is a fantastic installation by Bruce Chao,who is chair of the Sculpture and Glass Blowing Department,at Rhode Island School of Design.,He saw nests in the canopy at one of our Canopy Confluences,in the Pacific Northwest, and created this beautiful sculpture.,We've had dance people up in the canopy.,Jodi Lomask, and her wonderful troupe Capacitor,,joined me in the canopy in my rainforest site in Costa Rica.,They made a fabulous dance called "Biome." 
 They danced in the forest,,and we are taking this dance, my scientific outreach communications,,and also linking up with environmental groups,,to go to different cities and to perform,the science, the dance and the environmental outreach,that we hope will make a difference.,We brought musicians to the canopy,,and they made their music -- and it's fantastic music.,We had wooden flutists, we had oboists,,we had opera singers, we had guitar players,,and we had rap singers.,And I brought a little segment to give you,of Duke Brady's "Canopy Rap.",(Music) That's Duke! 
 (Applause) 
 This experience of working with Duke,also led me to initiate a program called Sound Science.,I saw the power of Duke's song with urban youth --,an audience, you know, I as a middle-aged professor,,I don't have a hope of getting to --,in terms of convincing them of the importance of wildlands.,So I engaged Caution, this rap singer,,with a group of young people from inner-city Tacoma.,We went out to the forest, I would pick up a branch,,Caution would rap on it,,and suddenly that branch was really cool.,And then the students would come into our sound studios,,they would make their own rap songs with their own beats.,They ended up making a CD,which they took home to their family and friends,,thereby expressing their own experiences with nature,in their own medium. 
 The final project I'll talk about is one that's very close to my heart,,and it involves an economic and social value,that is associated with epiphytic plants.,In the Pacific Northwest,,there's a whole industry of moss-harvesting,from old-growth forests.,These mosses are taken from the forest;,they're used by the floriculture industry, by florists,,to make arrangements and make hanging baskets.,It's a 265 million dollar industry,and it's increasing rapidly.,If you remember that bald guy,,you'll know that what has been stripped off of these trunks,in the Pacific Northwest old-growth forest,is going to take decades and decades to come back.,So this whole industry is unsustainable.,What can I, as an ecologist, do about that? 
 Well, my thought was that I could learn how to grow mosses,,and that way we wouldn't have to take them out of the wild.,And I thought, if I had some partners that could help me with this,,that would be great.,And so, I thought perhaps incarcerated men and women --,who don't have access to nature,,who often have a lot of time, they often have space,,and you don't need any sharp tools to work with mosses --,would be great partners.,And they have become excellent partners.,The best I can imagine.,They were very enthusiastic. 
 (Applause) 
 They were incredibly enthusiastic about the work.,They learned how to distinguish different species of mosses,,which, to tell you the truth,,is a lot more than my undergraduate students at the Evergreen College can do.,And they embraced the idea that they could help develop a research design,in order to grow these mosses.,We've been successful as partners,in figuring out which species grow the fastest,,and I've just been overwhelmed with how successful this has been.,Because the prison wardens were very enthusiastic about this as well,,I started a Science and Sustainability Seminar in the prisons.,I brought my scientific colleagues and sustainability practitioners into the prison.,We gave talks once a month,,and that actually ended up implementing,some amazing sustainability projects at the prisons --,organic gardens, worm culture, recycling,,water catchment and beekeeping. (Applause) 
 Our latest endeavor, 
 with a grant 
 from the Department of Corrections at Washington state,,they've asked us to expand this program to three more prisons.,And our new project is having the inmates and ourselves,learn how to raise the Oregon spotted frog,which is a highly endangered amphibian in Washington state and Oregon.,So they will raise them -- in captivity, of course --,from eggs to tadpoles and onward to frogs.,And they will have the pleasure, many of them,,of seeing those frogs that they've raised from eggs and helped develop,,helped nurture, move out into protected wildlands,to augment the number of endangered species out there in the wild. 
 And so, I think for many reasons --,ecological, social, economic and perhaps even spiritual --,this has been a tremendous project,and I'm really looking forward to,not only myself and my students doing it,,but also to promote and teach other scientists how to do this.,As many of you are aware, the world of academia is a rather inward-looking one.,I'm trying to help researchers move more outward,to have their own partnerships,with people outside of the academic community.,And so I'm hoping that my husband Jack, the ant taxonomist,,can perhaps work with Mattel to make Taxonomist Ken.,Perhaps Ben Zander and Bill Gates could get together,and make an opera about AIDS.,Or perhaps Al Gore and Naturally 7 could make a song about climate change,that would really make you clap your hands. 
 So, although it's a little bit of a fantasy, I think it's also a reality.,Given the duress that we're feeling environmentally in these times,,it is time for scientists to reach outward,,and time for those outside of science to reach towards academia as well.,I started my career with trying to understand the mysteries of forests,with the tools of science.,By making these partnerships that I described to you,,I have really opened my mind and, I have to say, my heart,to have a greater understanding,,to make other discoveries about nature and myself. 
 When I look into my heart, I see trees --,this is actually an image of a real heart --,there are trees in our hearts,,there are trees in your hearts.,When we come to understand nature,,we are touching the most deep, the most important parts of our self.,In these partnerships, I have also learned,that people tend to compartmentalize themselves,into IT people, and movie star people, and scientists,,but when we share nature,,when we share our perspectives about nature,,we find a common denominator. 
 Finally, as a scientist and as a person,and now, as part of the TED community,,I feel that I have better tools,to go out to trees, to go out to forests, to go out to nature,,to make new discoveries about nature --,and about humans' place in nature,wherever we are and whomever you are. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I love theater.,I love the idea that you can transform, become somebody else,and look at life with a completely new perspective.,I love the idea that people will sit in one room for a couple of hours and listen.,The idea that in that room at that moment,,everyone, regardless of their age, their gender, their race, their color, their religion,,comes together.,At that moment, we transcend space and time together.,Theater awakens our senses and opens the door to our imagination.,And our ability to imagine is what makes us explorers.,Our ability to imagine makes us inventors and creators and unique.,I was commissioned in 2003 to create an original show,,and began developing "Upwake.","Upwake" tells the story of Zero,,a modern-day business man, going to work with his life in a suitcase,,stuck between dream and reality and not able to decipher the two.,I wanted "Upwake" to have the same audiovisual qualities as a movie would.,And I wanted to let my imagination run wild.,So I began drawing the story that was moving in my head. 
 If Antoine de Saint-Exupery, the author of "The Little Prince," were here,,he would have drawn three holes inside that box,and told you your sheep was inside.,Because, if you look closely enough, things will begin to appear.,This is not a box; these are the renderings of my imagination,from head to paper to screen to life.,In "Upwake" buildings wear suits, Zero tap dances on a giant keyboard,,clones himself with a scanner, tames and whips the computer mice,,sails away into dreamscape from a single piece of paper and launches into space.,I wanted to create environments that moved and morphed like an illusionist.,Go from one world to another in a second.,I wanted to have humor, beauty, simplicity and complexity,and use metaphors to suggest ideas.,At the beginning of the show, for example, Zero deejays dream and reality.,Technology is an instrument that allowed me to manifest my visions,in high definition, live, on stage. 
 So today, I would like to talk to you about the relationship,between theater and technology.,Let's start with technology.,(Fuse blowing),All right. Let's start with theater.,(Laughter),(Buzzing),(Click, click, bang),(Laughter),(Applause),Thank you. 
 "Upwake" lasts 52 minutes and 54 seconds.,I project 3D animation on all the four surfaces of the stage,which I interact with.,The use of animation and projection was a process of discovery.,I didn't use it as a special effect, but as a partner on stage.,There are no special effects in "Upwake," no artifice.,It's as lavish and intricate as it is simple and minimal.,Three hundred and forty-four frames, four and a half years and commissions later,,what started as a one person show became a collaborative work,of nineteen most talented artists.,And here are some excerpts.,(Applause),Thank you. 
 So this is, relatively, a new show that we're now beginning to tour.,And in Austin, Texas,,I was asked to give small demonstrations in schools during the afternoon.,When I arrived at one of the schools, I certainly did not expect this:,Six hundred kids, packed in a gymnasium, waiting.,I was a little nervous performing without animation, costume -- really -- and make-up.,But the teachers came to me afterward and told me,they hadn't seen the kids that attentive.,And I think the reason why is that I was able to use their language and their reality,in order to transport them into another.,Something happened along the way.,Zero became a person and not just a character in a play.,Zero does not speak, is neither man nor woman.,Zero is Zero, a little hero of the 21st Century,,and Zero can touch so many more people than I possibly could. 
 It's as much about bringing new disciplines inside this box,as it is about taking theater out of its box.,As a street performer, I have learned that everybody wants to connect.,And that usually, if you're a bit extraordinary, if you're not exactly of human appearance,,then people will feel inclined to participate and to feel out loud.,It's as though you made something resonate within them.,It's as though the mystery of the person they're interacting with and connecting,allows them to be themselves just a bit more.,Because through your mask, they let theirs go. 
 Being human is an art form.,I know theater can improve the quality of people's lives,,and I know theater can heal.,I've worked as a doctor clown in a hospital for two years.,I have seen sick kids and sad parents and doctors,be lifted and transported in moments of pure joy.,I know theater unites us.,Zero wants to engage the generation of today and tomorrow,,tell various stories through different mediums. 
 Comic books. Quantum physics video games.,And Zero wants to go to the moon.,In 2007, Zero launched a green campaign,,suggesting his friends and fans to turn off their electricity,every Sunday from 7:53 to 8:00 p.m.,The idea is simple, basic. It's not original,,but it's important, and it's important to participate. 
 There is a revolution.,It's a human and technological revolution.,It's motion and emotion.,It's information.,It's visual. It's musical. It's sensorial.,It's conceptual. It's universal. It's beyond words and numbers.,It's happening.,The natural progression of science and art,finding each other to better touch and define the human experience.,There is a revolution in the way that we think,,in the way that we share, and the way that we express our stories,,our evolution.,This is a time of communication, connection and creative collaboration.,Charlie Chaplin innovated motion pictures,and told stories through music, silence, humor and poetry.,He was social, and his character, The Tramp, spoke to millions.,He gave entertainment, pleasure and relief to so many human beings,when they needed it the most. 
 We are not here to question the possible; we are here to challenge the impossible.,In the science of today, we become artists.,In the art of today, we become scientists.,We design our world. We invent possibilities.,We teach, touch and move.,It is now that we can use the diversity of our talents,to create intelligent, meaningful and extraordinary work. It's now.,(Ringing),Thank you.,(Applause)I have a studio in Berlin --,let me cue on here --,which is down there in this snow, just last weekend.,In the studio we do a lot of experiments.,I would consider the studio more like a laboratory.,I have occasional meetings with scientists.,And I have an academy, a part of the University of Fine Arts in Berlin.,We have an annual gathering of people,,and that is called Life in Space.,Life in Space is really not necessarily about,how we do things, but why we do things. 
 Do you mind looking, with me, at that little cross in the center there?,So just keep looking. Don't mind me.,So you will have a yellow circle, and we will do an after-image experiment.,When the circle goes away you will have another color, the complementary color.,I am saying something. And your eyes and your brain are saying something back.,This whole idea of sharing, the idea of constituting reality,by overlapping what I say and what you say --,think of a movie. 
 Since two years now, with some stipends from the science ministry in Berlin,,I've been working on these films,where we produce the film together.,I don't necessarily think the film is so interesting.,Obviously this is not interesting at all in the sense of the narrative.,But nevertheless, what the potential is --,and just keep looking there --,what the potential is, obviously,,is to kind of move the border of who is the author,,and who is the receiver.,Who is the consumer, if you want,,and who has responsibility for what one sees?,I think there is a socializing dimension,in, kind of, moving that border.,Who decides what reality is? 
 This is the Tate Modern in London.,The show was, in a sense, about that.,It was about a space in which I put half a semi-circular yellow disk.,I also put a mirror in the ceiling, and some fog, some haze.,And my idea was to make the space tangible.,With such a big space, the problem is,obviously that there is a discrepancy,between what your body can embrace,,and what the space, in that sense, is.,So here I had the hope that by inserting some natural elements,,if you want -- some fog -- I could make the space tangible. 
 And what happens is that people, they start to see themselves in this space.,So look at this. Look at the girl.,Of course they have to look through a bloody camera,in a museum. Right? That's how museums are working today.,But look at her face there,,as she's checking out, looking at herself in the mirror.,"Oh! That was my foot there!",She wasn't really sure whether she was seeing herself or not.,And in that whole idea,,how do we configure the relationship between our body and the space?,How do we reconfigure it?,How do we know that being in a space makes a difference? 
 Do you see when I said in the beginning, it's about,why, rather than how?,The why meant really,,"What consequences does it have when I take a step?","What does it matter?","Does it matter if I am in the world or not?","And does it matter whether the kind of actions I take,filter into a sense of responsibility?",Is art about that?,I would say yes. It is obviously about,not just about decorating the world, and making it look even better,,or even worse, if you ask me. 
 It's obviously also about taking responsibility,,like I did here when throwing some green dye in the river,in L.A., Stockholm, Norway and Tokyo,,among other places.,The green dye is not environmentally dangerous,,but it obviously looks really rather frightening.,And it's on the other side also, I think, quite beautiful,,as it somehow shows the turbulence in these kind of downtown areas,,in these different places of the world. 
 The "Green river," as a kind of activist idea, not a part of an exhibition,,it was really about showing people,,in this city, as they walk by,,that space has dimensions. A space has time.,And the water flows through the city with time.,The water has an ability to make,the city negotiable, tangible.,Negotiable meaning that it makes a difference,whether you do something or not.,It makes a difference whether you say, "I'm a part of this city.,And if I vote it makes a difference.,If I take a stand, it makes a difference." 
 This whole idea of a city not being a picture is,,I think, something that art, in a sense,,always was working with.,The idea that art can actually evaluate the relationship,between what it means to be in a picture,,and what it means to be in a space. What is the difference?,The difference between thinking and doing.,So these are different experiments with that. I won't go into them.,Iceland, lower right corner, my favorite place. 
 These kinds of experiments, they filter into architectural models.,These are ongoing experiments.,One is an experiment I did for BMW,,an attempt to make a car.,It's made out of ice.,A crystalline stackable principle in the center on the top,,which I am trying to turn into a concert hall in Iceland.,A sort of a run track, or a walk track,,on the top of a museum in Denmark,,which is made of colored glass, going all around.,So the movement with your legs,will change the color of your horizon.,And two summers ago at the Hyde Park in London,,with the Serpentine Gallery:,a kind of a temporal pavilion where,moving was the only way you could see the pavilion.,This summer, in New York:,there is one thing about falling water which is very much about,the time it takes for water to fall.,It's quite simple and fundamental. 
 I've walked a lot in the mountains in Iceland.,And as you come to a new valley,,as you come to a new landscape, you have a certain view.,If you stand still, the landscape,doesn't necessarily tell you how big it is.,It doesn't really tell you what you're looking at.,The moment you start to move, the mountain starts to move.,The big mountains far away, they move less.,The small mountains in the foreground, they move more.,And if you stop again, you wonder,,"Is that a one-hour valley?,Or is that a three-hour hike, or is that a whole day I'm looking at?" 
 If you have a waterfall in there,,right out there at the horizon; you look at the waterfall,and you go, "Oh, the water is falling really slowly.",And you go, "My god it's really far away and it's a giant waterfall.",If a waterfall is falling faster,,it's a smaller waterfall which is closer by --,because the speed of falling water is pretty constant everywhere.,And your body somehow knows that.,So this means a waterfall is a way of measuring space. 
 Of course being an iconic city like New York,,that has had an interest in somehow,playing around with the sense of space, you could say that New York,wants to seem as big as possible.,Adding a measurement,to that is interesting:,the falling water suddenly gives you a sense,of, "Oh, Brooklyn is exactly this much --,the distance between Brooklyn and Manhattan, in this case,the lower East River is this big." 
 So it was not just necessarily about putting nature into the cities.,It was also about giving the city a sense of dimension.,And why would we want to do that?,Because I think it makes a difference,whether you have a body,that feels a part of a space,,rather than having a body which is just in front of a picture.,And "Ha-ha, there is a picture and here is I. And what does it matter?",Is there a sense of consequences? 
 So if I have a sense of the space,,if I feel that the space is tangible,,if I feel there is time,,if there is a dimension I could call time,,I also feel that I can change the space.,And suddenly it makes a difference,in terms of making space accessible.,One could say this is about,community, collectivity.,It's about being together. 
 How do we create public space?,What does the word "public" mean today anyway?,So, asked in that way,,I think it raises great things about,parliamentary ideas, democracy, public space,,being together, being individual.,How do we create,an idea which is both tolerant to individuality,,and also to collectivity,,without polarizing the two,into two different opposites?,Of course the political agendas in the world,has been very obsessed, polarizing the two against each other,into different, very normative ideas. 
 I would claim that art and culture,,and this is why art and culture are so incredibly interesting,in the times we're living in now,,have proven that one can,create a kind of a space,which is both sensitive to individuality,and to collectivity.,It's very much about this causality, consequences.,It's very much about the way we link,thinking and doing.,So what is between thinking and doing?,And right in-between thinking and doing,,I would say, there is experience.,And experience is not just,a kind of entertainment in a non-casual way.,Experience is about responsibility.,Having an experience is taking part in the world.,Taking part in the world is really about sharing responsibility.,So art, in that sense,,I think holds an incredible relevance,in the world in which we're moving into,,particularly right now.,That's all I have. Thank you very much.,(Applause)I've been intrigued by this question,of whether we could evolvenor develop a sixth sense --,a sense that would give us seamless access,and easy access to meta-informationnor information that may exist somewhere,that may be relevant to help usnmake the right decision,about whatever it isnthat we're coming across.,And some of you may argue,,"Well, don't today's cell phonesndo that already?",But I would say no.,When you meet someone here at TED --,and this is the top networking place,nof course, of the year --,you don't shake somebody's hand,and then say,n"Can you hold on for a moment,while I take out my phone and Google you?",Or when you go to the supermarket,and you're standing therenin that huge aisle,of different types of toilet papers,,you don't take out your cell phone,nand open a browser,,and go to a website to try to decidenwhich of these different toilet papers,is the most ecologicallynresponsible purchase to make. 
 So we don't really have easy accessnto all this relevant information,that can just help usnmake optimal decisions,about what to do nextnand what actions to take.,And so my research group at the Media Lab,has been developing a series of inventions,to give us access to this informationnin a sort of easy way,,without requiring that the usernchanges any of their behavior.,And I'm here to unveil our latest effort,,and most successful effort so far,,which is still very muchna work in process.,I'm actually wearing the device right nownand we've sort of cobbled it together,with components that are off the shelf --,and that, by the way, only costn350 dollars at this point in time. 
 I'm wearing a camera,njust a simple web cam,,a portable, battery-powerednprojection system with a little mirror.,These components communicatento my cell phone in my pocket,which acts as the communicationnand computation device.,And in the video here we seenmy student Pranav Mistry,,who's really the geniusnwho's been implementing,and designing this whole system.,And we see how this systemnlets him walk up to any surface,and start using his handsnto interact with the information,that is projected in front of him.,The system tracksnthe four significant fingers.,In this case, he's wearingnsimple marker caps,that you may recognize.,But if you want a more stylish version,,you could also paint your nailsnin different colors. 
 And the camera basicallyntracks these four fingers,and recognizes any gesturesnthat he's making,so he can just go to,nfor example, a map of Long Beach,,zoom in and out, etc.,The system also recognizes iconic gesturesnsuch as the "take a picture" gesture,,and then takes a picturenof whatever is in front of you.,And when he then walksnback to the Media Lab,,he can just go up to any wall,and project all the picturesnthat he's taken,,sort through them and organize them,nand re-size them, etc.,,again using all natural gestures. 
 So, some of you most likelynwere here two years ago,and saw the demo by Jeff Han,nor some of you may think,,"Well, doesn't this look likenthe Microsoft Surface Table?",And yes, you also interactnusing natural gestures,,both hands, etc.,But the difference herenis that you can use any surface,,you can walk up to any surface,,including your hand,nif nothing else is available,,and interact with this projected data.,The device is completelynportable, and can be -- 
 (Applause) 
 (Applause ends) 
 So, one important differencenis that it's totally mobile.,Another even more importantndifference is that in mass production,,this would not cost more tomorrownthan today's cell phones,and would actually notnsort of be a bigger packaging --,could look a lot more stylish,than this versionnthat I'm wearing around my neck.,But other than letting some of younlive out your fantasy,of looking as cool as Tom Cruisenin "Minority Report,",the reason why we're reallynexcited about this device,is that it really can actnas one of these sixth-sense devices,that gives you relevant informationnabout whatever is in front of you.,So we see Pranav herengoing into the supermarket,and he's shopping for some paper towels.,And, as he picks up a product,,the system can recognizenthe product that he's picking up,,using either image recognitionnor marker technology,,and give him the green lightnor an orange light.,He can ask for additional information.,So this particular choice here,is a particularly good choice,ngiven his personal criteria.,Some of you may want the toilet papernwith the most bleach in it,rather than the most ecologicallynresponsible choice. 
 (Laughter) 
 If he picks up a book in the bookstore,nhe can get an Amazon rating --,it gets projectednright on the cover of the book.,This is Juan's book, our previous speaker,,which gets a great rating,nby the way, at Amazon.,And so, Pranav turns the page of the book,and can then see additionalninformation about the book --,reader comments, maybe sort of informationnby his favorite critic, etc.,If he turns to a particular page,,he finds an annotation by maybenan expert or a friend of ours,that gives him a little bitnof additional information,about whatever is on that particular page.,Reading the newspaper --nit never has to be outdated. 
 (Laughter) 
 You can get video annotationsnof the events that you're reading about.,You can get the latest sports scores, etc.,This is a more controversial one. 
 (Laughter) 
 As you interact with someone at TED,,maybe you can seena word cloud of the tags,,the words that are associatednwith that person,in their blog and personal web pages.,In this case, the studentnis interested in cameras, etc.,On your way to the airport,,if you pick up your boarding pass, it canntell you that your flight is delayed,,that the gate has changed, etc.,And, if you need to knownwhat the current time is,,it's as simple as drawing a watch -- 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 on your arm. 
 So that's where we're at so farnin developing this sixth sense,that would give us seamless accessnto all this relevant information,about the things that we may come across.,My student Pranav, who's really,nlike I said, the genius behind this. 
 (Applause and cheering) 
 (Applause ends) 
 He does deserve a lot of applause,,because I don't think he's slept muchnin the last three months, actually.,And his girlfriend is probablynnot very happy about him either.,But it's not perfect yet,nit's very much a work in progress.,And who knows, maybe in another 10 years,we'll be here with the ultimatensixth sense brain implant. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I want to share with you,some ideas about the secret power of time,,in a very short time. 
 Video: All right, start the clock please. 30 seconds studio.,Keep it quiet please. Settle down.,It's about time. End sequence. Take one.,15 seconds studio.,10, nine, eight, seven,,six, five, four, three, two ... 
 Philip Zimbardo: Let's tune into the conversation,of the principals in Adam's temptation.,"Come on Adam, don't be so wishy-washy. Take a bite." "I did.","One bite, Adam. Don't abandon Eve.","I don't know, guys.,I don't want to get in trouble.","Okay. One bite. What the hell?",(Laughter) 
 Life is temptation. It's all about yielding, resisting,,yes, no, now, later, impulsive, reflective,,present focus and future focus.,Promised virtues fall prey to the passions of the moment. 
 Of teenage girls who pledged sexual abstinence and virginity until marriage --,thank you George Bush --,the majority, 60 percent, yielded to sexual temptations within one year.,And most of them did so without using birth control.,So much for promises. 
 Now lets tempt four-year-olds, giving them a treat.,They can have one marshmallow now. But if they wait,until the experimenter comes back, they can have two.,Of course it pays, if you like marshmallows, to wait.,What happens is two-thirds of the kids give in to temptation.,They cannot wait. The others, of course, wait.,They resist the temptation. They delay the now for later. 
 Walter Mischel, my colleague at Stanford,,went back 14 years later,,to try to discover what was different about those kids.,There were enormous differences between kids who resisted,and kids who yielded, in many ways.,The kids who resisted scored 250 points higher on the SAT.,That's enormous. That's like a whole set of different IQ points.,They didn't get in as much trouble. They were better students.,They were self-confident and determined. And the key for me today,,the key for you,,is, they were future-focused rather than present-focused. 
 So what is time perspective? That's what I'm going to talk about today.,Time perspective is the study of how individuals,,all of us, divide the flow of your human experience,into time zones or time categories.,And you do it automatically and non-consciously.,They vary between cultures, between nations,,between individuals, between social classes,,between education levels.,And the problem is that they can become biased,,because you learn to over-use some of them and under-use the others. 
 What determines any decision you make?,You make a decision on which you're going to base an action.,For some people it's only about what is in the immediate situation,,what other people are doing and what you're feeling.,And those people, when they make their decisions in that format --,we're going to call them "present-oriented,",because their focus is what is now. 
 For others, the present is irrelevant.,It's always about "What is this situation like that I've experienced in the past?",So that their decisions are based on past memories.,And we're going to call those people "past-oriented," because they focus on what was. 
 For others it's not the past, it's not the present,,it's only about the future.,Their focus is always about anticipated consequences.,Cost-benefit analysis.,We're going to call them "future-oriented." Their focus is on what will be. 
 So, time paradox, I want to argue,,the paradox of time perspective,,is something that influences every decision you make,,you're totally unaware of.,Namely, the extent to which you have one of these,biased time perspectives.,Well there is actually six of them. There are two ways to be present-oriented.,There is two ways to be past-oriented, two ways to be future.,You can focus on past-positive, or past-negative.,You can be present-hedonistic,,namely you focus on the joys of life, or present-fatalist --,it doesn't matter, your life is controlled.,You can be future-oriented, setting goals.,Or you can be transcendental future:,namely, life begins after death.,Developing the mental flexibility to shift time perspectives fluidly,depending on the demands of the situation,,that's what you've got to learn to do. 
 So, very quickly, what is the optimal time profile?,High on past-positive. Moderately high on future.,And moderate on present-hedonism.,And always low on past-negative,and present-fatalism.,So the optimal temporal mix is what you get from the past --,past-positive gives you roots. You connect your family, identity and your self.,What you get from the future is wings,to soar to new destinations, new challenges.,What you get from the present hedonism,is the energy, the energy to explore yourself,,places, people, sensuality. 
 Any time perspective in excess has more negatives than positives.,What do futures sacrifice for success?,They sacrifice family time. They sacrifice friend time.,They sacrifice fun time. They sacrifice personal indulgence.,They sacrifice hobbies. And they sacrifice sleep. So it affects their health.,And they live for work, achievement and control.,I'm sure that resonates with some of the TEDsters.,(Laughter) 
 And it resonated for me. I grew up as a poor kid in the South Bronx ghetto,,a Sicilian family -- everyone lived in the past and present.,I'm here as a future-oriented person,who went over the top, who did all these sacrifices,because teachers intervened, and made me future oriented.,Told me don't eat that marshmallow,,because if you wait you're going to get two of them,,until I learned to balance out.,I've added present-hedonism, I've added a focus on the past-positive,,so, at 76 years old, I am more energetic than ever, more productive,,and I'm happier than I have ever been. 
 I just want to say that we are applying this to many world problems:,changing the drop-out rates of school kids,,combating addictions, enhancing teen health,,curing vets' PTSD with time metaphors -- getting miracle cures --,promoting sustainability and conservation,,reducing physical rehabilitation where there is a 50-percent drop out rate,,altering appeals to suicidal terrorists,,and modifying family conflicts as time-zone clashes. 
 So I want to end by saying:,many of life's puzzles can be solved,by understanding your time perspective and that of others.,And the idea is so simple, so obvious,,but I think the consequences are really profound.,Thank you so much.,(Applause)A month ago today,I stood there:,90 degrees south, the top of,the bottom of the world, the Geographic South Pole.,And I stood there beside two very good friends of mine,,Richard Weber and Kevin Vallely.,Together we had just broken the world speed record,for a trek to the South Pole.,It took us 33 days,,23 hours and 55 minutes to get there.,We shaved five days off the previous best time.,And in the process, I became the first person in history,to make the entire 650-mile journey,,from Hercules Inlet to South Pole,,solely on feet, without skis. 
 Now, many of you are probably saying, "Wait a sec,,is this tough to do?",(Laughter),Imagine, if you will,,dragging a sled, as you just saw in that video clip,,with 170 pounds of gear,,in it everything you need to survive on your Antarctic trek.,It's going to be 40 below, every single day.,You'll be in a massive headwind.,And at some point you're going to have to cross these cracks in the ice,,these crevasses.,Some of them have a very precarious thin footbridge underneath them,that could give way at a moment's notice,,taking your sled, you, into the abyss, never to be seen again.,The punchline to your journey? Look at the horizon.,Yes, it's uphill the entire way,,because the South Pole is at 10,000 feet,,and you're starting at sea level. 
 Our journey did not, in fact, begin at Hercules Inlet,,where frozen ocean meets the land of Antarctica.,It began a little less than two years ago.,A couple of buddies of mine and I,had finished a 111-day run across the entire Sahara desert.,And while we were there we learned,the seriousness of the water crisis in Northern Africa.,We also learned that many of the issues facing the people of Northern Africa,affected young people the most.,I came home to my wife after 111 days of running in the sand,,and I said, "You know, there's no doubt if this bozo can get across the desert,,we are capable of doing anything we set our minds to.",But if I'm going to continue doing these adventures, there has to be,a reason for me to do them,beyond just getting there. 
 Around that time I met an extraordinary human being,,Peter Thum, who inspired me with his actions.,He's trying to find and solve water issues, the crisis around the world.,His dedication inspired me to come up with this expedition:,a run to the South Pole,where, with an interactive website,,I will be able to bring young people, students and teachers from around the world,on board the expedition with me,,as active members.,So we would have a live website, that every single day of the 33 days,,we would be blogging, telling stories of,,you know, depleted ozone forcing us to cover our faces,,or we will burn.,Crossing miles and miles of sastrugi --,frozen ice snowdrifts that could be hip-deep.,I'm telling you, crossing these things with 170-pound sled,,that sled may as well have weighed 1,700 pounds,,because that's what it felt like. 
 We were blogging to this live website daily,to these students that were tracking us as well,,about 10-hour trekking days,,15-hour trekking days,,sometimes 20 hours of trekking daily to meet our goal.,We'd catch cat-naps at 40 below on our sled, incidentally.,In turn, students,,people from around the world, would ask us questions.,Young people would ask the most amazing questions. 
 One of my favorite: It's 40 below, you've got to go to the bathroom,,where are you going to go and how are you going to do it?,I'm not going to answer that. But I will answer some of the more popular questions. 
 Where do you sleep? We slept in a tent that was very low to the ground,,because the winds on Antarctica were so extreme, it would blow anything else away. 
 What do you eat? One of my favorite dishes on expedition:,butter and bacon. It's about a million calories.,We were burning about 8,500 a day,,so we needed it. 
 How many batteries do you carry for all the equipment that you have?,Virtually none. All of our equipment, including film equipment,,was charged by the sun. 
 And do you get along? I certainly hope so,,because at some point or another on this expedition,,one of your teammates is going to have to take a very big needle,,and put it in an infected blister, and drain it for you. 
 But seriously, seriously, we did get along,,because we had a common goal of wanting to inspire these young people.,They were our teammates! They were inspiring us.,The stories we were hearing got us to the South Pole.,The website worked brilliantly as a two-way street of communication.,Young people in northern Canada, kids in an elementary school,,dragging sleds across the school-yard,,pretending they were Richard, Ray and Kevin. Amazing. 
 We arrived at the South Pole. We huddled into that tent,,45 below that day, I'll never forget it.,We looked at each other with these looks,of disbelief at what we had just completed.,And I remember looking at the guys thinking,,"What do I take from this journey?" You know? Seriously.,That I'm this uber-endurance guy? 
 As I stand here today talking to you guys,,I've been running for the grand sum of five years.,And a year before that I was a pack-a-day smoker,,living a very sedentary lifestyle.,What I take from this journey, from my journeys,,is that, in fact,,within every fiber of my belief standing here,,I know that we can make the impossible possible.,I'm learning this at 40.,Can you imagine? Seriously, can you imagine?,I'm learning this at 40 years of age.,Imagine being 13 years old,,hearing those words, and believing it.,Thank you very much. Thank you.,(Applause)What I wanted to talk to you about today is two things:,one, the rise of a culture of availability;,and two, a request.,So we're seeing a rise of this availability,being driven by mobile device proliferation,,globally, across all social strata.,We're seeing, along with that proliferation of mobile devices,,an expectation of availability.,And, with that, comes the third point,,which is obligation -- and an obligation to that availability. 
 And the problem is, we're still working through,,from a societal standpoint,,how we allow people to be available.,There's a significant delta, in fact,,between what we're willing to accept.,Apologies to Hans Rosling --,he said anything that's not using real stats is a lie --,but the big delta there,is how we deal with this from a public standpoint.,So we've developed certain tactics and strategies,to cover up. 
 This first one's called "the lean.",And if you've ever been in a meeting where you play sort of meeting "chicken,",you're sitting there, looking at the person, waiting for them to look away,,and then quickly checking the device.,Although you can see the gentleman up on the right is busting him. 
 "The stretch.",OK, the gentleman on the left is saying, "Screw you,,I'm going to check my device.",But the guy, here, on the right,,he's doing the stretch.,It's that reeeee-e-e-each out, the physical contortion,to get that device just below the tabletop. 
 Or, my favorite, the "Love you; mean it.",(Laughter),Nothing says "I love you",like "Let me find somebody else I give a damn about." 
 Or, this one, coming to us from India.,You can find this on YouTube,,the gentleman who's recumbent on a motorcycle,while text messaging.,Or what we call the "sweet gravy, stop me before I kill again!",That is actually the device. 
 What this is doing is, we find a --,(Laughter),a direct collision --,we find a direct collision between availability --,and what's possible through availability --,and a fundamental human need -- which we've been hearing about a lot, actually --,the need to create shared narratives.,We're very good at creating personal narratives,,but it's the shared narratives that make us a culture.,And when you're standing with someone,,and you're on your mobile device,,effectively what you're saying to them is,,"You are not as important as, literally,,almost anything that could come to me through this device." 
 Look around you.,There might be somebody on one right now,,participating in multi-dimensional engagement. 
 (Laughter) 
 Our reality right now is less interesting,than the story we're going to tell about it later. 
 This one I love.,This poor kid, clearly a prop --,don't get me wrong, a willing prop --,but the kiss that's being documented kind of looks like it sucks. 
 This is the sound of one hand clapping. 
 So, as we lose the context of our identity,,it becomes incredibly important,that what you share becomes the context of shared narrative,,becomes the context in which we live.,The stories that we tell -- what we push out --,becomes who we are.,People aren't simply projecting identity,,they're creating it. 
 And so that's the request I have for everybody in this room.,We are creating the technology,that is going to create the new shared experience,,which will create the new world.,And so my request is,,please, let's make technologies,that make people more human,,and not less. 
 Thank you.Why do so many people reach success and then fail?,One of the big reasons is, we think success is a one-way street.,So we do everything that leads up to success,,but then we get there. We figure we've made it,,we sit back in our comfort zone,,and we actually stop doing everything that made us successful.,And it doesn't take long to go downhill.,And I can tell you this happens,,because it happened to me. 
 Reaching success, I worked hard, I pushed myself.,But then I stopped, because I figured, "Oh, you know, I made it.,I can just sit back and relax." 
 Reaching success, I always tried to improve and do good work.,But then I stopped because I figured, "Hey, I'm good enough.,I don't need to improve any more." 
 Reaching success, I was pretty good at coming up with good ideas.,Because I did all these simple things that led to ideas.,But then I stopped, because I figured I was this hot-shot guy,and I shouldn't have to work at ideas, they should just come like magic.,And the only thing that came was creative block.,I couldn't come up with any ideas. 
 Reaching success, I always focused on clients and projects,,and ignored the money. Then all this money started pouring in.,And I got distracted by it.,And suddenly I was on the phone to my stockbroker and my real estate agent,,when I should have been talking to my clients. 
 And reaching success, I always did what I loved.,But then I got into stuff that I didn't love,,like management. I am the world's worst manager,,but I figured I should be doing it, because I was, after all,,the president of the company. 
 Well, soon a black cloud formed over my head,and here I was, outwardly very successful,,but inwardly very depressed.,But I'm a guy; I knew how to fix it.,I bought a fast car.,(Laughter),It didn't help.,I was faster but just as depressed. 
 So I went to my doctor. I said, "Doc,,I can buy anything I want. But I'm not happy. I'm depressed.,It's true what they say, and I didn't believe it until it happened to me.,But money can't buy happiness.",He said, "No. But it can buy Prozac.",And he put me on anti-depressants.,And yeah, the black cloud faded a little bit, but so did all the work,,because I was just floating along. I couldn't care less if clients ever called.,(Laughter) 
 And clients didn't call.,(Laughter),Because they could see I was no longer serving them,,I was only serving myself.,So they took their money and their projects to others who would serve them better. 
 Well, it didn't take long for business to drop like a rock.,My partner and I, Thom, we had to let all our employees go.,It was down to just the two of us, and we were about to go under.,And that was great.,Because with no employees, there was nobody for me to manage. 
 So I went back to doing the projects I loved.,I had fun again, I worked harder and, to cut a long story short,,did all the things that took me back up to success.,But it wasn't a quick trip.,It took seven years. 
 But in the end, business grew bigger than ever.,And when I went back to following these eight principles,,the black cloud over my head disappeared altogether.,And I woke up one day and I said,,"I don't need Prozac anymore.",And I threw it away and haven't needed it since. 
 I learned that success isn't a one-way street.,It doesn't look like this; it really looks more like this.,It's a continuous journey.,And if we want to avoid "success-to-failure-syndrome,",we just keep following these eight principles,,because that is not only how we achieve success,,it's how we sustain it.,So here is to your continued success.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)If you're at all like me,,this is what you do with the sunny summer weekends in San Francisco:,you build experimental kite-powered hydrofoils,capable of more than 30 knots.,And you realize that there is incredible power in the wind,,and it can do amazing things.,And one day, a vessel not unlike this,will probably break the world speed record. 
 But kites aren't just toys like this.,Kites: I'm going to give you a brief history,,and tell you about the magnificent future,of every child's favorite plaything.,So, kites are more than a thousand years old,,and the Chinese used them for military applications,,and even for lifting men.,So they knew at that stage they could carry large weights.,I'm not sure why there is a hole in this particular man. 
 (Laughter) 
 In 1827, a fellow called George Pocock,actually pioneered the use of kites for towing buggies,in races against horse carriages across the English countryside.,Then of course, at the dawn of aviation,,all of the great inventors of the time --,like Hargreaves, like Langley,,even Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone, who was flying this kite --,were doing so in the pursuit of aviation. 
 Then these two fellows came along,,and they were flying kites to develop the control systems,that would ultimately enable powered human flight.,So this is of course Orville and Wilbur Wright,,and the Wright Flyer.,And their experiments with kites led to this,momentous occasion, where we powered up and took off for the,first-ever 12-second human flight.,And that was fantastic for the future of commercial aviation. 
 But unfortunately, it relegated kites once again to be considered children's toys.,That was until the 1970s, where we had the last energy crisis.,And a fabulous man called Miles Loyd,who lives on the outskirts of San Francisco,,wrote this seminal paper that was completely ignored,in the Journal of Energy,about how to use basically an airplane on a piece of string,to generate enormous amounts of electricity.,The real key observation he made is that,a free-flying wing can sweep through more sky and generate more power,in a unit of time than a fixed-wing turbine. 
 So turbines grew. And they can now span up to three hundred feet at the hub height,,but they can't really go a lot higher,,and more height is where the more wind is, and more power --,as much as twice as much. 
 So cut to now. We still have an energy crisis,,and now we have a climate crisis as well. You know,,so humans generate about 12 trillion watts,,or 12 terawatts, from fossil fuels.,And Al Gore has spoken to why we need to hit one of these targets,,and in reality what that means is in the next 30 to 40 years,,we have to make 10 trillion watts or more of new clean energy somehow.,Wind is the second-largest renewable resource after solar:,3600 terawatts, more than enough to supply humanity 200 times over.,The majority of it is in the higher altitudes, above 300 feet,,where we don't have a technology as yet to get there. 
 So this is the dawn of the new age of kites.,This is our test site on Maui, flying across the sky.,I'm now going to show you,the first autonomous generation of power,by every child's favorite plaything.,As you can tell, you need to be a robot to fly this thing for thousands of hours.,It makes you a little nauseous.,And here we're actually generating about 10 kilowatts --,so, enough to power probably five United States households --,with a kite not much larger than this piano.,And the real significant thing here,is we're developing the control systems,,as did the Wright brothers, that would enable sustained, long-duration flight.,And it doesn't hurt to do it in a location like this either. 
 So this is the equivalent for a kite flier of peeing in the snow --,that's tracing your name in the sky. 
 And this is where we're actually going.,So we're beyond the 12-second steps.,And we're working towards megawatt-scale machines,that fly at 2000 feet and generate tons of clean electricity. 
 So you ask, how big are those machines?,Well, this paper plane would be maybe a -- oop!,That would be enough to power your cell phone.,Your Cessna would be 230 killowatts.,If you'd loan me your Gulfstream, I'll rip its wings off and generate you a megawatt.,If you give me a 747, I'll make six megawatts,,which is more than the largest wind turbines today.,And the Spruce Goose would be a 15-megawatt wing. 
 So that is audacious, you say. I agree.,But audacious is what has happened many times before in history.,This is a refrigerator factory,,churning out airplanes for World War II.,Prior to World War II, they were making 1000 planes a year.,By 1945, they were making 100,000.,With this factory and 100,000 planes a year,,we could make all of America's electricity in about 10 years. 
 So really this is a story about the audacious plans of young people,with these dreams. There are many of us.,I am lucky enough to work with 30 of them.,And I think we need to support all of the dreams,of the kids out there doing these crazy things.,Thank you.,(Applause)I normally teach courses on,how to rebuild states after war.,But today I've got a personal story to share with you.,This is a picture of my family,,my four siblings -- my mom and I -- taken in 1977.,And we're actually Cambodians.,And this picture is taken in Vietnam.,So how did a Cambodian family end up in Vietnam in 1977?,Well to explain that, I've got a short video clip,to explain the Khmer Rouge regime,during 1975 and 1979. 
 Video: April 17th, 1975.,The communist Khmer Rouge,enters Phnom Penh to liberate their people,from the encroaching conflict in Vietnam,,and American bombing campaigns.,Led by peasant-born Pol Pot,,the Khmer Rouge evacuates people to the countryside,in order to create a rural communist utopia,,much like Mao Tse-tung's Cultural Revolution in China.,The Khmer Rouge closes the doors to the outside world.,But after four years the grim truth seeps out.,In a country of only seven million people,,one and a half million were murdered by their own leaders,,their bodies piled in the mass graves of the killing fields. 
 Sophal Ear: So, notwithstanding the 1970s narration,,on April 17th 1975,we lived in Phnom Penh.,And my parents were told by the Khmer Rouge,to evacuate the city because of impending American bombing for three days.,And here is a picture of the Khmer Rouge.,They were young soldiers, typically child soldiers.,And this is very normal now, of modern day conflict,,because they're easy to bring into wars. 
 The reason that they gave about American bombing wasn't all that far off.,I mean, from 1965 to 1973 there were,more munitions that fell on Cambodia,than in all of World War II Japan,,including the two nuclear bombs,of August 1945.,The Khmer Rouge didn't believe in money.,So the equivalent of the Federal Reserve Bank,in Cambodia was bombed.,But not just that, they actually banned money.,I think it's the only precedent in which,money has ever been stopped from being used.,And we know money is the root of all evil,,but it didn't actually stop evil from happening in Cambodia, in fact. 
 My family was moved from Phnom Penh to Pursat province.,This is a picture of what Pursat looks like.,It's actually a very pretty area of Cambodia,,where rice growing takes place.,And in fact they were forced to work the fields.,So my father and mother ended up in,a sort of concentration camp, labor camp. 
 And it was at that time that my mother got word,from the commune chief,that the Vietnamese were actually asking,for their citizens to go back to Vietnam.,And she spoke some Vietnamese,,as a child having grown up with Vietnamese friends.,And she decided, despite the advice of her neighbors,,that she would take the chance,and claim to be Vietnamese,so that we could have a chance to survive,,because at this point they're forcing everybody to work.,And they're giving about --,in a modern-day, caloric-restriction diet, I guess --,they're giving porridge, with a few grains of rice. 
 And at about this time actually,my father got very sick.,And he didn't speak Vietnamese.,So he died actually, in January 1976.,And it made it possible, in fact,,for us to take on this plan.,So the Khmer Rouge took us,from a place called Pursat to Kaoh Tiev,,which is across from the border from Vietnam.,And there they had a detention camp,where alleged Vietnamese would be tested, language tested. 
 And my mother's Vietnamese was so bad,that to make our story more credible,,she'd given all the boys and girls new Vietnamese names.,But she'd given the boys girls' names,,and the girls boys' names.,And it wasn't until she met a Vietnamese lady,who told her this, and then tutored her for two days intensively,,that she was able to go into her exam,and -- you know, this was a moment of truth.,If she fails, we're all headed to the gallows;,if she passes, we can leave to Vietnam.,And she actually, of course -- I'm here, she passes.,And we end up in Hong Ngu on the Vietnamese side.,And then onwards to Chau Doc.,And this is a picture of Hong Ngu, Vietnam today.,A pretty idyllic place on the Mekong Delta.,But for us it meant freedom.,And freedom from persecution from the Khmer Rouge. 
 Last year, the Khmer Rouge Tribunal,,which the U.N. is helping Cambodia take on,,started, and I decided that as a matter of record,I should file a Civil Complaint,with the Tribunal about my father's passing away.,And I got word last month,that the complaint was officially accepted by the Khmer Rouge Tribunal.,And it's for me a matter of justice for history, and accountability for the future,,because Cambodia remains a pretty lawless place, at times. 
 Five years ago my mother and I went back to Chau Doc.,And she was able to return to a place,that for her meant freedom, but also fear,,because we had just come out of Cambodia.,I'm happy, actually, today, to present her.,She's here today with us in the audience.,Thank you mother. 
 (Applause)Last year at TED we aimed to try to clarify,the overwhelming complexity,and richness that we experience at the conference,in a project called Big Viz.,And the Big Viz is a collection of 650 sketches,that were made by two visual artists.,David Sibbet from The Grove,,and Kevin Richards, from Autodesk,,made 650 sketches that strive to capture,the essence of each presenter's ideas.,And the consensus was: it really worked.,These sketches brought to life the key ideas,,the portraits, the magic moments,that we all experienced last year. 
 This year we were thinking, "Why does it work?",What is it about animation,,graphics, illustrations, that create meaning?,And this is an important question to ask and answer,because the more we understand how the brain creates meaning,,the better we can communicate,,and, I also think, the better we can think and collaborate together.,So this year we're going to visualize how,the brain visualizes. 
 Cognitive psychologists now tell us that the brain,doesn't actually see the world as it is,,but instead, creates a series of mental models,through a collection of "Ah-ha moments,",or moments of discovery, through various processes. 
 The processing, of course, begins with the eyes.,Light enters, hits the back of the retina, and is circulated,,most of which is streamed to the very back of the brain,,at the primary visual cortex.,And primary visual cortex sees just simple geometry,,just the simplest of shapes.,But it also acts like a kind of relay station,that re-radiates and redirects information,to many other parts of the brain.,As many as 30 other parts that selectively make more sense,,create more meaning through the kind of "Ah-ha" experiences.,We're only going to talk about three of them. 
 So the first one is called the ventral stream.,It's on this side of the brain.,And this is the part of the brain that will recognize what something is.,It's the "what" detector.,Look at a hand. Look at a remote control. Chair. Book.,So that's the part of the brain that is activated,when you give a word to something. 
 A second part of the brain is called the dorsal stream.,And what it does is locates the object,in physical body space.,So if you look around the stage here,you'll create a kind of mental map of the stage.,And if you closed your eyes you'd be able to mentally navigate it.,You'd be activating the dorsal stream if you did that. 
 The third part that I'd like to talk about,is the limbic system.,And this is deep inside of the brain. It's very old, evolutionarily.,And it's the part that feels.,It's the kind of gut center, where you see an image,and you go, "Oh! I have a strong,or emotional reaction to whatever I'm seeing." 
 So the combination of these processing centers,help us make meaning in very different ways.,So what can we learn about this? How can we apply this insight?,Well, again, the schematic view,is that the eye visually interrogates what we look at.,The brain processes this in parallel, the figments of information,asking a whole bunch of questions,to create a unified mental model. 
 So, for example, when you look at this image,a good graphic invites the eye to dart around,,to selectively create a visual logic.,So the act of engaging, and looking at the image creates the meaning.,It's the selective logic.,Now we've augmented this and spatialized this information.,Many of you may remember the magic wall that we built,in conjunction with Perceptive Pixel,where we quite literally create an infinite wall.,And so we can compare and contrast the big ideas.,So the act of engaging and creating interactive imagery,enriches meaning.,It activates a different part of the brain.,And then the limbic system,is activated when we see motion, when we see color,,and there are primary shapes and pattern detectors,that we've heard about before. 
 So the point of this is what?,We make meaning by seeing,,by an act of visual interrogation.,The lessons for us are three-fold.,First, use images to clarify what we're trying to communicate.,Secondly make those images interactive,so that we engage much more fully.,And the third is to augment memory,by creating a visual persistence.,These are techniques that can be used to be --,that can be applied in a wide range of problem solving. 
 So the low-tech version looks like this.,And, by the way, this is the way in which,we develop and formulate,strategy within Autodesk,,in some of our organizations and some of our divisions.,What we literally do is have the teams,draw out the entire strategic plan,on one giant wall.,And it's very powerful because everyone gets to see everything else.,There's always a room, always a place,to be able to make sense of all of the components,in the strategic plan. 
 This is a time-lapse view of it.,You can ask the question, "Who's the boss?",You'll be able to figure that out. (Laughter),So the act of collectively and collaboratively,building the image,transforms the collaboration.,No Powerpoint is used in two days.,But instead the entire team,creates a shared mental model,that they can all agree on and move forward on. 
 And this can be enhanced and augmented with,some emerging digital technology.,And this is our great unveiling for today.,And this is an emerging set of technologies,that use large-screen displays,with intelligent calculation in the background,to make the invisible visible.,Here what we can do is look at sustainability, quite literally.,So a team can actually look at,all the key components that heat the structure,and make choices and then see the end result,that is visualized on this screen. 
 So making images meaningful has three components.,The first again, is making ideas clear by visualizing them.,Secondly, making them interactive.,And then thirdly, making them persistent.,And I believe that these three principles,can be applied to solving some of the very tough problems,that we face in the world today. Thanks so much. 
 (Applause)I started with paragliding.,Paragliding is taking off from mountains,with a paraglider, with the possibility to,fly cross-country, distance,,just with the use of thermals to soar.,Also different aerobatic maneuvers are possible,with a paraglider. 
 From there I started with skydiving.,In this picture you can see,there is a four-way skydive,,four people flying together,,and on the left hand side it's the camera flier,with the camera mounted to his helmet,so he can film the whole jump,,for the film itself and also for the judging. 
 From regular, relative skydiving,I went on to freeflying.,Freeflying is more the three-dimensional skydiving.,You can see the skydiver with the red suit,,he's in a stand-up position.,The one with the yellow-green suit,,he's flying head-down.,And that's me in the background, carving around the whole formation,in freefall also, with the helmet cam,to film this jump. 
 From freeflying I went on to skysurfing.,Skysurfing is skydiving with a board on the feet.,You can imagine with this big surface,of a skysurfing board,,there is a lot of force, a lot of power.,Of course I can use this power,for example for nice spinning -- we call it "helicopter moves." 
 From there I went on to wingsuit flying.,Wingsuit flying is a suit,,that I can make fly, just only with my body.,If I put some tension on my body, tension on my suit,,I can make it fly. And as you see,the fall rate is much much slower,because of the bigger surface.,With a proper body position I'm able to really move forward,to gain quite some distance.,This is a jump I did in Rio de Janeiro.,You can see the Copacabana on the left-hand side. 
 From there with all the skills and knowledge,from paragliding and all the different disciplines,in skydiving, I went on to BASE jumping.,BASE jumping is skydiving from fixed objects,,like buildings, antennae, bridges and earth --,meaning mountains, cliffs.,It's for sure -- for me -- it's the ultimate feeling,of being in free fall,,with all the visual references. 
 So my goal soon was to discover new places,that nobody had jumped before.,So in summer 2000 I was the first to BASE jump,the Eiger North Face in Switzerland.,Two years after this, I was the first to BASE jump from Matterhorn,,a very famous mountain that probably,everybody knows in here.,2005 I did a BASE jump from the Eiger, from the Monk and from the Jungfrau,,three very famous mountains in Switzerland.,The special thing on these three jumps were,,I hiked them all and climbed them all in only one day.,In 2008 I jumped the Eiffel Tower in Paris.,(Laughter) 
 So with all this knowledge, I also,wanted to get into stunts.,So with some friends we started to do different tricks,,like for example this jump here,,I jumped from a paraglider.,Or here -- everybody was freezing, pretty much, except me,,because it was very cold in Austria,where we did this filming.,Everybody sitting in a basket,,and I was on top of the balloon,,ready to slide down with my skysurf board.,Or this jump, from a moving truck on the highway.,(Laughter) 
 Extreme sports on top level like this,is only possible if you practice step by step,,if you really work hard on your skills,and on your knowledge.,Of course you need to be in physical, very good, condition,,so I'm training a lot.,You need to have the best possible equipment.,And probably the most important is,you have to work on your mental skills, mental preparation.,And all this to come as close as possible,to the human dream of being able to fly. 
 So for 2009,,I'm training hard for my two new projects.,The first one, I want to set a world record,in flying from a cliff with my wingsuit.,And I want to set a new record,,with the longest distance ever flown.,For my second project,,I have a sensational idea,of a jump that never has been done before. 
 So now, on the following movie you will see,that I'm much better in flying a wingsuit,than speaking in English.,Enjoy, and thank you very much.,(Applause) 
 (Applause) 
 June Cohen: I have some questions.,I think we all might have some questions.,Question one: so does that actually feel,the way the flying dream does?,Because it looks like it might. 
 Ueli Gegenschatz: Pretty much. I believe this is probably the closest,possibility to come to the dream of being able to fly. 
 JC: I know the answer to this, but how do you land? 
 UE: Parachute. We have to open a parachute,just seconds before, I would say, impact.,(Laughter),It's not possible to land a wingsuit yet. 
 JC: Yet. But people are trying. Are you among those --,you're not going to commit -- are you among those trying to do it? 
 UE: It's a dream. It's a dream. Yeah.,We're still working on it and we're,developing the wingsuits to get better performance,,to get more knowledge.,And I believe soon. 
 JC: All right. Well we will watch this space. But I have two more questions.,What is the -- there was exhaust coming,out of the back of the wingsuit. Was that a propelled wingsuit that you were wearing? 
 UE: Nope. It's just smoke. 
 JC: Coming off of you? 
 (Laughter) 
 UE: Hopefully not. 
 (Laughter) 
 JC: That seems dangerous. 
 UE: No, smoke is for two reasons,,you can see the speed, you can see the way,where I was flying.,That's reason number one. And reason number two:,it's much easier for the camera guy to film,If I'm using smoke. 
 JC: Ah, I see. So the wingsuit is set up to deliberately release smoke,so that you can be tracked. One more question.,What do you do to to cover your face?,Because I just keep thinking of going that fast,and having your whole face smushed backwards.,Are you in a helmet? Are you in goggles? 
 UE: The purest and the best feeling would be with only goggles. 
 JC: And is that how you usually fly? 
 UE: Usually I'm wearing a helmet. In the mountains I'm always wearing a helmet,because of landings -- usually it's difficult --,it's not like regular skydiving where you have like the big landings.,So you have to be prepared. 
 JC: Right. Now is there anything you don't do?,Do people come to you with projects and say, "We want you to do this!",and do you ever say, "No, no I'm not going to." 
 UE: Oh of course, of course. Some people have crazy ideas and -- 
 (Laughter) 
 JC: ...a round of applause... 
 (Applause) 
 UE: Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I was walking in the market one day with my wife,,and somebody stuck a cage in my face.,And in between those slits,were the saddest eyes I've ever seen.,There was a very sick orangutan baby, my first encounter.,That evening I came back to the market in the dark,and I heard "uhh, uhh,",and sure enough I found a dying orangutan baby on a garbage heap.,Of course, the cage was salvaged.,I took up the little baby,,massaged her, forced her to drink,until she finally started breathing normally. 
 This is Uce.,She's now living in the jungle of Sungai Wain,,and this is Matahari, her second son,,which, by the way, is also the son of the second orangutan I rescued, Dodoy.,That changed my life quite dramatically,,and as of today, I have almost 1,000 babies in my two centers. 
 (Applause) 
 No. No. No. Wrong.,It's horrible. It's a proof of our failing to save them in the wild.,It's not good.,This is merely proof of everyone failing to do the right thing.,Having more than all the orangutans in all the zoos in the world together,,just now like victims for every baby,,six have disappeared from the forest. 
 The deforestation, especially for oil palm,,to provide biofuel for Western countries,is what's causing these problems.,And those are the peat swamp forests on 20 meters of peat,,the largest accumulation of organic material in the world.,When you open this for growing oil palms,you're creating CO2 volcanoes,that are emitting so much CO2,that my country is now the third largest emitter of greenhouse gasses in the world,,after China and the United States.,And we don't have any industry at all --,it's only because of this deforestation. 
 And these are horrible images.,I'm not going to talk too long about it,,but there are so many of the family of Uce,,which are not so fortunate to live out there in the forest,,that still have to go through that process.,And I don't know anymore where to put them.,So I decided that I had to come up with a solution for her,but also a solution,that will benefit the people that are trying to exploit those forests,,to get their hands on the last timber,and that are causing, in that way,,the loss of habitat and all those victims. 
 So I created the place Samboja Lestari,,and the idea was,,if I can do this on the worst possible place that I can think of,where there is really nothing left,,no one will have an excuse to say, "Yeah, but ...",No. Everyone should be able to follow this. 
 So we're in East Borneo. This is the place where I started.,As you can see there's only yellow terrain.,There's nothing left -- just a bit of grass there.,In 2002 we had about 50 percent of the people jobless there.,There was a huge amount of crime.,People spent so much of their money on health issues and drinking water.,There was no agricultural productivity left.,This was the poorest district in the whole province,and it was a total extinction of wildlife.,This was like a biological desert.,When I stood there in the grass, it's hot -- not even the sound of insects --,just this waving grass. 
 Still, four years later we have created jobs for about 3,000 people.,The climate has changed. I will show you:,no more flooding, no more fires.,It's no longer the poorest district,,and there is a huge development of biodiversity.,We've got over 1,000 species. We have 137 bird species as of today.,We have 30 species of reptiles. 
 So what happened here? We created a huge economic failure in this forest.,So basically the whole process of destruction,had gone a bit slower than what is happening now with the oil palm.,But we saw the same thing.,We had slash and burn agriculture;,people cannot afford the fertilizer,,so they burn the trees and have the minerals available there;,the fires become more frequent,,and after a while you're stuck with an area of land,where there is no fertility left.,There are no trees left.,Still, in this place, in this grassland,where you can see our very first office there on that hill,,four years later, there is this one green blop on the Earth's surface ... 
 (Applause) 
 And there are all these animals, and all these people happy,,and there's this economic value. 
 So how's this possible?,It was quite simple. If you'll look at the steps:,we bought the land, we dealt with the fire,,and then only, we started doing the reforestation,by combining agriculture with forestry.,Only then we set up the infrastructure and management and the monetary.,But we made sure that in every step of the way,the local people were going to be fully involved,so that no outside forces would be able to interfere with that.,The people would become the defenders of that forest.,So we do the "people, profit, planet" principles,,but we do it in addition,to a sure legal status --,because if the forest belongs to the state,,people say, "It belongs to me, it belongs to everyone.",And then we apply all these other principles,like transparency, professional management, measurable results,,scalability, [unclear], etc. 
 What we did was we formulated recipes --,how to go from a starting situation where you have nothing,to a target situation.,You formulate a recipe based upon the factors you can control,,whether it be the skills or the fertilizer or the plant choice.,And then you look at the outputs and you start measuring what comes out.,Now in this recipe you also have the cost.,You also know how much labor is needed.,If you can drop this recipe on the map,on a sandy soil, on a clay soil,,on a steep slope, on flat soil,,you put those different recipes; if you combine them,,out of that comes a business plan,,comes a work plan, and you can optimize it,for the amount of labor you have available or for the amount of fertilizer you have,,and you can do it. 
 This is how it looks like in practice. We have this grass we want to get rid of.,It exudes [unclear]-like compounds from the roots.,The acacia trees are of a very low value,but we need them to restore the micro-climate, to protect the soil,and to shake out the grasses.,And after eight years they might actually yield some timber --,that is, if you can preserve it in the right way,,which we can do with bamboo peels.,It's an old temple-building technique from Japan,but bamboo is very fire-susceptible.,So if we would plant that in the beginning,we would have a very high risk of losing everything again.,So we plant it later, along the waterways,to filter the water, provide the raw products,just in time for when the timber becomes available. 
 So the idea is: how to integrate these flows,in space, over time and with the limited means you have.,So we plant the trees, we plant these pineapples,and beans and ginger in between, to reduce the competition for the trees,,the crop fertilizer. Organic material is useful for the agricultural crops,,for the people, but also helps the trees. The farmers have free land,,the system yields early income, the orangutans get healthy food,and we can speed up ecosystem regeneration,while even saving some money. 
 So beautiful. What a theory. 
 But is it really that easy?,Not really, because if you looked at what happened in 1998,,the fire started.,This is an area of about 50 million hectares.,January.,February.,March.,April.,May.,We lost 5.5 million hectares in just a matter of a few months.,This is because we have 10,000 of those underground fires,that you also have in Pennsylvania here in the United States.,And once the soil gets dried, you're in a dry season -- you get cracks,,oxygen goes in, flames come out and the problem starts all over again. 
 So how to break that cycle?,Fire is the biggest problem.,This is what it looked like for three months.,For three months, the automatic lights outside did not go off,because it was that dark.,We lost all the crops. No children gained weight for over a year;,they lost 12 IQ points. It was a disaster,for orangutans and people.,So these fires are really the first things to work on.,That was why I put it as a single point up there.,And you need the local people for that because these grasslands,,once they start burning ... It goes through it like a windstorm,and you lose again the last bit of ash and nutrients,to the first rainfall -- going to the sea,killing off the coral reefs there. 
 So you have to do it with the local people.,That is the short-term solution but you also need a long-term solution.,So what we did is, we created,a ring of sugar palms around the area.,These sugar palms turn out to be fire-resistant --,also flood-resistant, by the way --,and they provide a lot of income for local people. 
 This is what it looks like:,the people have to tap them twice a day -- just a millimeter slice --,and the only thing you harvest is sugar water,,carbon dioxide, rain fall and a little bit of sunshine.,In principle, you make those trees into,biological photovoltaic cells.,And you can create so much energy from this --,they produce three times more energy per hectare per year,,because you can tap them on a daily basis.,You don't need to harvest [unclear],or any other of the crops. 
 So this is the combination where we have all this genetic potential in the tropics,,which is still unexploited, and doing it in combination with technology.,But also your legal side needs to be in very good order.,So we bought that land,,and here is where we started our project --,in the middle of nowhere.,And if you zoom in a bit you can see that all of this area,is divided into strips that go over different types of soil,,and we were actually monitoring,,measuring every single tree in these 2,000 hectares, 5,000 acres.,And this forest is quite different. 
 What I really did was I just followed nature,,and nature doesn't know monocultures,,but a natural forest is multilayered.,That means that both in the ground and above the ground,it can make better use of the available light,,it can store more carbon in the system, it can provide more functions.,But, it's more complicated. It's not that simple, and you have to work with the people. 
 So, just like nature,,we also grow fast planting trees and underneath that,,we grow the slower growing, primary-grain forest trees of a very high diversity,that can optimally use that light. Then,,what is just as important: get the right fungi in there,that will grow into those leaves, bring back the nutrients,to the roots of the trees that have just dropped that leaf within 24 hours.,And they become like nutrient pumps.,You need the bacteria to fix nitrogen,,and without those microorganisms, you won't have any performance at all. 
 And then we started planting -- only 1,000 trees a day.,We could have planted many, many more, but we didn't want to,because we wanted to keep the number of jobs stable.,We didn't want to lose the people,that are going to work in that plantation.,And we do a lot of work here.,We use indicator plants to look at what soil types,,or what vegetables will grow, or what trees will grow here.,And we have monitored every single one of those trees from space. 
 This is what it looks like in reality;,you have this irregular ring around it,,with strips of 100 meters wide, with sugar palms,that can provide income for 648 families.,It's only a small part of the area. 
 The nursery, in here, is quite different.,If you look at the number of tree species we have in Europe, for instance,,from the Urals up to England, you know how many?,165.,In this nursery, we're going to grow 10 times more than the number of species.,Can you imagine?,You do need to know what you are working with,,but it's that diversity which makes it work.,That you can go from this zero situation,,by planting the vegetables and the trees, or directly, the trees,in the lines in that grass there,,putting up the buffer zone, producing your compost,,and then making sure that at every stage of that up growing forest,there are crops that can be used.,In the beginning, maybe pineapples and beans and corn;,in the second phase, there will be bananas and papayas;,later on, there will be chocolate and chilies.,And then slowly, the trees start taking over,,bringing in produce from the fruits, from the timber, from the fuel wood.,And finally, the sugar palm forest takes over,and provides the people with permanent income. 
 On the top left, underneath those green stripes,,you see some white dots -- those are actually individual pineapple plants,that you can see from space.,And in that area we started growing some acacia trees,that you just saw before.,So this is after one year.,And this is after two years.,And that's green. If you look from the tower --,this is when we start attacking the grass.,We plant in the seedlings,mixed with the bananas, the papayas, all the crops for the local people,,but the trees are growing up fast in between as well.,And three years later, 137 species of birds are living here. 
 (Applause) 
 So we lowered air temperature three to five degrees Celsius.,Air humidity is up 10 percent.,Cloud cover -- I'm going to show it to you -- is up.,Rainfall is up.,And all these species and income. 
 This ecolodge that I built here,,three years before, was an empty, yellow field.,This transponder that we operate with the European Space Agency --,it gives us the benefit that every satellite that comes over to calibrate itself,is taking a picture.,Those pictures we use to analyze how much carbon, how the forest is developing,,and we can monitor every tree using satellite images through our cooperation.,We can use these data now,to provide other regions with recipes and the same technology.,We actually have it already with Google Earth.,If you would use a little bit of your technology to put tracking devices in trucks,,and use Google Earth in combination with that,,you could directly tell what palm oil has been sustainably produced,,which company is stealing the timber,,and you could save so much more carbon,than with any measure of saving energy here. 
 So this is the Samboja Lestari area.,You measure how the trees grow back,,but you can also measure the biodiversity coming back.,And biodiversity is an indicator of how much water can be balanced,,how many medicines can be kept here.,And finally I made it into the rain machine,because this forest is now creating its own rain.,This nearby city of Balikpapan has a big problem with water;,it's 80 percent surrounded by seawater,,and we have now a lot of intrusion there.,Now we looked at the clouds above this forest;,we looked at the reforestation area, the semi-open area and the open area. 
 And look at these images.,I'll just run them very quickly through.,In the tropics, raindrops are not formed from ice crystals,,which is the case in the temperate zones,,you need the trees with [unclear], chemicals that come out of the leaves of the trees,that initiate the raindrops.,So you create a cool place where clouds can accumulate,,and you have the trees to initiate the rain.,And look, there's now 11.2 percent more clouds --,already, after three years.,If you look at rainfall, it was already up 20 percent at that time.,Let's look at the next year,,and you can see that that trend is continuing.,Where at first we had a small cap of higher rainfall,,that cap is now widening and getting higher.,And if we look at the rainfall pattern,above Samboja Lestari, it used to be the driest place,,but now you see consistently see a peak of rain forming there.,So you can actually change the climate.,When there are trade winds of course the effect disappears,,but afterwards, as soon as the wind stabilizes,,you see again that the rainfall peaks come back above this area. 
 So to say it is hopeless is not the right thing to do,,because we actually can make that difference,if you integrate the various technologies.,And it's nice to have the science, but it still depends mostly upon the people,,on your education.,We have our farmer schools.,But the real success of course, is our band --,because if a baby is born, we will play, so everyone's our family,and you don't make trouble with your family. 
 This is how it looks.,We have this road going around the area,,which brings the people electricity and water from our own area.,We have the zone with the sugar palms,,and then we have this fence with very thorny palms,to keep the orangutans -- that we provide with a place to live in the middle --,and the people apart.,And inside, we have this area for reforestation,as a gene bank to keep all that material alive,,because for the last 12 years,not a single seedling of the tropical hardwood trees has grown up,because the climatic triggers have disappeared.,All the seeds get eaten. 
 So now we do the monitoring on the inside --,from towers, satellites, ultralights.,Each of the families that have sold their land now get a piece of land back.,And it has two nice fences of tropical hardwood trees --,you have the shade trees planted in year one,,then you underplanted with the sugar palms,,and you plant this thorny fence.,And after a few years, you can remove some of those shade trees.,The people get that acacia timber which we have preserved with the bamboo peel,,and they can build a house, they have some fuel wood to cook with.,And they can start producing from the trees as many as they like.,They have enough income for three families.,But whatever you do in that program, it has to be fully supported by the people,,meaning that you also have to adjust it to the local, cultural values.,There is no simple one recipe for one place. 
 You also have to make sure that it is very difficult to corrupt --,that it's transparent.,Like here, in Samboja Lestari,,we divide that ring in groups of 20 families.,If one member trespasses the agreement,,and does cut down trees,,the other 19 members have to decide what's going to happen to him.,If the group doesn't take action,,the other 33 groups have to decide what is going to happen to the group,that doesn't comply with those great deals that we are offering them. 
 In North Sulawesi it is the cooperative --,they have a democratic culture there,,so there you can use the local justice system to protect your system.,In summary, if you look at it, in year one the people can sell their land,to get income, but they get jobs back in the construction and the reforestation,,the working with the orangutans, and they can use the waste wood to make handicraft.,They also get free land in between the trees,,where they can grow their crops.,They can now sell part of those fruits to the orangutan project.,They get building material for houses,,a contract for selling the sugar,,so we can produce huge amounts of ethanol and energy locally.,They get all these other benefits: environmentally, money,,they get education -- it's a great deal. 
 And everything is based upon that one thing --,make sure that forest remains there.,So if we want to help the orangutans --,what I actually set out to do --,we must make sure that the local people are the ones that benefit.,Now I think the real key to doing it, to give a simple answer,,is integration.,I hope -- if you want to know more, you can read more. 
 (Applause)Forrest North: The beginning of any collaboration,starts with a conversation.,And I would like to share with you,some of the bits of the conversation that we started with.,I grew up in a log cabin in Washington state,with too much time on my hands. 
 Yves Behar: And in scenic Switzerland for me. 
 FN: I always had a passion for alternative vehicles.,This is a land yacht racing across the desert in Nevada. 
 YB: Combination of windsurfing and skiing into this invention there. 
 FN: And I also had an interest in dangerous inventions.,This is a 100,000-volt Tesla coil,that I built in my bedroom,,much to the dismay of my mother. 
 YB: To the dismay of my mother,,this is dangerous teenage fashion right there.,(Laughter) 
 FN: And I brought this all together,,this passion with alternative energy and raced a solar car across Australia --,also the U.S. and Japan. 
 YB: So, wind power, solar power -- we had a lot to talk about.,We had a lot that got us excited.,So we decided to do a special project together.,To combine engineering and design and ... 
 FN: Really make a fully integrated product, something beautiful. 
 YB: And we made a baby.,(Laughter) 
 FN: Can you bring out our baby?,(Applause),This baby is fully electric.,It goes 150 miles an hour.,It's twice the range of any electric motorcycle.,Really the exciting thing about a motorcycle,is just the beautiful integration of engineering and design.,It's got an amazing user experience.,It was wonderful working with Yves Behar.,He came up with our name and logo. We're Mission Motors.,And we've only got three minutes,,but we could talk about it for hours. 
 YB: Thank you. 
 FN: Thank you TED. And thank you Chris, for having us.,(Applause)My journey to coming here today,started in 1974.,That's me with the funny gloves.,I was 17 and going on a peace walk.,What I didn't know though, was most of those people, standing there,with me, were Moonies.,(Laughter),And within a week,I had come to believe,that the second coming of Christ had occurred,,that it was Sun Myung Moon,,and that I had been specially chosen and prepared by God,to be his disciple. 
 Now as cool as that sounds,,my family was not that thrilled with this.,(Laughter),And they tried everything they could to get me out of there.,There was an underground railroad of sorts,that was going on during those years. Maybe some of you remember it.,They were called deprogrammers.,And after about five long years,my family had me deprogrammed.,And I then became a deprogrammer.,I started going out on cases.,And after about five years of doing this,,I was arrested for kidnapping.,Most of the cases I went out on,were called involuntary.,What happened was that the family,had to get their loved ones some safe place somehow.,And so they took them to some safe place.,And we would come in and talk to them, usually for about a week.,And so after this happened,,I decided it was a good time to turn my back on this work. 
 And about 20 years went by.,There was a burning question though that would not leave me.,And that was, "How did this happen to me?",And in fact, what did happen to my brain?,Because something did.,And so I decided to write a book, a memoir,,about this decade of my life. 
 And toward the end of writing that book,there was a documentary that came out.,It was on Jonestown.,And it had a chilling effect on me.,These are the dead in Jonestown.,About 900 people died that day,,most of them taking their own lives.,Women gave poison to their babies,,and watched foam come from their mouths as they died. 
 The top picture is a group of Moonies,that have been blessed by their messiah.,Their mates were chosen for them.,The bottom picture is Hitler youth.,This is the leg of a suicide bomber.,The thing I had to admit to myself,,with great repulsion,,was that I get it.,I understand how this could happen.,I understand how someone's brain,,how someone's mind can come to the place,where it makes sense --,in fact it would be wrong, when your brain is working like that --,not to try to save the world through genocide. 
 And so what is this? How does this work?,And how I've come to view what happened to me,is a viral, memetic infection.,For those of you who aren't familiar with memetics,,a meme has been defined as,an idea that replicates in the human brain,and moves from brain to brain like a virus,,much like a virus. The way a virus works is --,it can infect and do the most damage to someone,who has a compromised immune system. 
 In 1974, I was young, I was naive,,and I was pretty lost in my world.,I was really idealistic.,These easy ideas to complex questions are very appealing,when you are emotionally vulnerable.,What happens is that,circular logic takes over.,"Moon is one with God.,God is going to fix all the problems in the world.,All I have to do is humbly follow.,Because God is going to stop war and hunger --,all these things I wanted to do --,all I have to do is humbly follow.,Because after all, God is [working through] the messiah. He's going to fix all this.",It becomes impenetrable.,And the most dangerous part of this,is that is creates "us" and "them,","right" and "wrong,","good" and "evil.",And it makes anything possible,,makes anything rationalizable. 
 And the thing is, though,,if you looked at my brain,during those years in the Moonies --,neuroscience is expanding exponentially,,as Ray Kurzweil said yesterday. Science is expanding.,We're beginning to look inside the brain.,And so if you looked at my brain, or any brain that's infected with,a viral memetic infection like this,,and compared it to anyone in this room,,or anyone who uses critical thinking on a regular basis,,I am convinced it would look very, very different. 
 And that, strange as it may sound,,gives me hope.,And the reason that gives me hope,is that the first thing is to admit,that we have a problem.,But it's a human problem. It's a scientific problem, if you will.,It happens in the human brain. There is no evil force out there to get us.,And so this is something that, through research and education,,I believe that we can solve.,And so the first step is to realize,that we can do this together,,and that there is no "us" and "them.",Thank you very much. (Applause)The first half of the 20th century,was an absolute disaster in human affairs,,a cataclysm.,We had the First World War,,the Great Depression,,the Second World War,and the rise of the communist nations.,And each one of these forces,split the world, tore the world apart,,divided the world.,And they threw up walls --,political walls, trade walls,,transportation walls,,communication walls, iron curtains --,which divided peoples and nations. 
 It was only in the second half of the 20th century,that we slowly began to pull ourselves,out of this abyss.,Trade walls began to come tumbling down.,Here are some data on tariffs:,starting at 40 percent, coming down to less than 5 percent.,We globalized the world. And what does that mean?,It means that we extended cooperation,across national boundaries;,we made the world more cooperative.,Transportation walls came tumbling down.,You know in 1950 the typical ship carried,5,000 to 10,000 tons worth of goods.,Today a container ship can carry 150,000 tons;,it can be manned with a smaller crew;,and unloaded faster than ever before.,Communication walls, I don't have to tell you -- the Internet --,have come tumbling down.,And of course the iron curtains,,political walls have come tumbling down. 
 Now all of this has been tremendous for the world.,Trade has increased.,Here is just a little bit of data.,In 1990, exports from China to the United States:,15 billion dollars.,By 2007: over 300 billion dollars.,And perhaps most remarkably,,at the beginning of the 21st century,,really for the first time in modern history,,growth extended to almost all parts of the world.,So China, I've already mentioned,,beginning around 1978, around the time of the death of Mao,,growth -- ten percent a year.,Year after year after year,,absolutely incredible.,Never before in human history,have so many people been raised out of,such great poverty as happened in China.,China is the world's greatest anti-poverty program,over the last three decades.,India, starting a little bit later,,but in 1990, begetting tremendous growth.,Incomes at that time,less than $1,000 per year.,And over the next 18 years,have almost tripled.,Growth of six percent a year. Absolutely incredible.,Now Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa --,Sub-Saharan Africa,has been the area of the world,most resistant to growth.,And we can see the tragedy of Africa,in the first few bars here.,Growth was negative.,People were actually getting poorer than their parents,,and sometimes even poorer than their grandparents had been.,But at the end of the 20th century,,the beginning of the 21st century,,we saw growth in Africa.,And I think, as you'll see, there's reasons for optimism,,because I believe that the best is yet to come.,Now why. 
 On the cutting edge today,it's new ideas which are driving growth.,And by that I mean it's,products for which the research and development costs,are really high, and the manufacturing costs are low.,More than ever before it is these types of ideas,which are driving growth on the cutting edge.,Now ideas have this amazing property.,Thomas Jefferson, I think, really expressed this quite well.,He said, "He who receives an idea from me,receives instruction himself, without lessening mine.,As he who lights his candle at mine,receives light without darkening me.",Or to put it slightly differently:,one apple feeds one man,,but an idea can feed the world.,Now this is not new. This is practically not new to TEDsters.,This is practically the model of TED.,But what is new is that the greater function of ideas,is going to drive growth even more than ever before.,This provides a reason why,trade and globalization,are even more important, more powerful than ever before,,and are going to increase growth more than ever before. 
 And to explain why this is so, I have a question.,Suppose that there are two diseases:,one of them is rare, the other one is common,,but if they are not treated they are equally severe.,If you had to choose, which would you rather have:,the common disease or the rare disease?,Common, the common -- I think that's absolutely right,,and why? Because there are more drugs to treat common diseases,than there are to treat rare diseases.,The reason for this is incentives.,It costs about the same to produce a new drug,whether that drug treats 1,000 people,,100,000 people, or a million people.,But the revenues are much greater if the drug treats a million people.,So the incentives are much larger,to produce drugs which treat more people.,To put this differently: larger markets save lives.,In this case misery truly does love company. 
 Now think about the following:,if China and India were as rich as the United States is today,,the market for cancer drugs would be eight times larger than it is now.,Now we are not there yet, but it is happening.,As other countries become richer,the demand for these pharmaceuticals,is going to increase tremendously.,And that means an increase incentive to do research and development,,which benefits everyone in the world.,Larger markets increase the incentive,to produce all kinds of ideas,,whether it's software, whether it's a computer chip,,whether it's a new design.,For the Hollywood people in the audience,,this even explains why action movies,have larger budgets than comedies:,it's because action movies translate easier,into other languages and other cultures,,so the market for those movies is larger.,People are willing to invest more,,and the budgets are larger. 
 Alright. Well if larger markets increase the incentive,to produce new ideas,,how do we maximize that incentive?,It's by having one world market, by globalizing the world.,The way I like to put this is:,one idea. Ideas are meant to be shared,,so one idea can serve one world, one market.,One idea, one world, one market.,Well how else can we create new ideas?,That's one reason.,Globalize trade.,How else can we create new ideas?,Well, more idea creators.,Now idea creators, they come from all walks of life.,Artists and innovators -- many of the people you've seen on this stage.,I'm going to focus on scientists and engineers,because I have some data on that, and I'm a data person. 
 Now, today, less than one-tenth of one percent,of the world's population are scientists and engineers.,(Laughter),The United States has been an idea leader.,A large fraction of those people are in the United States.,But the U.S. is losing its idea leadership.,And for that I am very grateful.,That is a good thing.,It is fortunate that we are becoming less of an idea leader,because for too long the United States,,and a handful of other developed countries,,have shouldered the entire burden,of research and development.,But consider the following:,if the world as a whole were as wealthy as the United States is now,there would be more than five times as many scientists and engineers,contributing to ideas which benefit everyone,,which are shared by everyone.,I think of the great Indian mathematician, Ramanujan.,How many Ramanujans are there in India today,toiling in the fields, barely able to feed themselves,,when they could be feeding the world?,Now we're not there yet.,But it is going to happen in this century.,The real tragedy of the last century is this:,if you think about the world's population,as a giant computer, a massively parallel processor,,then the great tragedy has been,that billions of our processors have been off line.,But in this century China is coming on line.,India is coming on line.,Africa is coming on line.,We will see an Einstein in Africa in this century. 
 Here is just some data. This is China.,1996: less than one million,new university students in China per year;,2006: over five million.,Now think what this means.,This means we all benefit when another country gets rich.,We should not fear other countries becoming wealthy.,That is something that we should embrace --,a wealthy China, a wealthy India, a wealthy Africa.,We need a greater demand for ideas --,those larger markets I was talking about earlier --,and a greater supply of ideas for the world.,Now you can see some of the reasons why I'm optimistic.,Globalization is increasing the demand,for ideas, the incentive to create new ideas.,Investments in education are increasing the supply of new ideas. 
 In fact if you look at world history,you can see some reasons for optimism.,From about the beginnings of humanity,to 1500: zero economic growth, nothing.,1500 to 1800: maybe a little bit of economic growth,,but less in a century,than you expect to see in a year today.,1900s: maybe one percent.,Twentieth century: a little bit over two percent.,Twenty-first century could easily be 3.3, even higher percent.,Even at that rate,,by 2100 average GDP per capita,in the world will be $200,000.,That's not U.S. GDP per capita, which will be over a million,,but world GDP per capita -- $200,000.,That's not that far.,We won't make it.,But some of our grandchildren probably will.,And I should say,,I think this is a rather modest prediction.,In Kurzweilian terms this is gloomy.,In Kurzweilian terms I'm like the Eeyore of economic growth.,(Laughter) 
 Alright what about problems?,What about a great depression?,Well let's take a look. Let's take a look at the Great Depression.,Here is GDP per capita,from 1900 to 1929.,Now let's imagine that you were an economist in 1929,,trying to forecast future growth for the United States,,not knowing that the economy was about to go off a cliff,,not knowing that we were about to enter,the greatest economic disaster certainly in the 20th century.,What would you have predicted, not knowing this?,If you had based your prediction, your forecast,on 1900 to 1929,you'd have predicted something like this.,If you'd been a little more optimistic --,say, based upon the Roaring Twenties -- you'd have said this.,So what actually happened?,We went off a cliff but we recovered.,In fact in the second half of the 20th century,growth was even higher than anything you would have predicted,based upon the first half of the 20th century.,So growth can wash away,even what appears to be a great depression. 
 Alright. What else?,Oil. Oil. This was a big topic.,When I was writing up my notes oil was $140 per barrel.,So people were asking a question. They were saying,,"Is China drinking our milkshake?",(Laughter),And there is some truth to this,,in the sense that we have something of a finite resource,,and increased growth is going to push up demand for that.,But I think I don't have to tell this audience,that a higher price of oil is not necessarily a bad thing.,Moreover, as everyone knows,,look -- it's energy, not oil, which counts.,And higher oil prices mean,a greater incentive to invest in energy R&D.,You can see this in the data.,As oil prices go up, energy patents go up.,The world is much better equipped,to overcome an increase in the price of oil,today, than ever in the past,,because of what I'm talking about.,One idea, one world, one market. 
 So I'm optimistic,so long as we hew to these two ideas:,to keep globalizing world markets,,keep extending cooperation across national boundaries,,and keep investing in education.,Now the United States has a particularly important role,to play in this:,to keep our education system globalized,,to keep our education system open to students from all over the world,,because our education system,is the candle,that other students come to light their own candles.,Now remember here what Jefferson said.,Jefferson said, "When they come,and light their candles at ours,,they gain light, and we are not darkened.",But Jefferson wasn't quite right, was he?,Because the truth is,,when they light their candles at ours,,there is twice as much light available for everyone.,So my view is: Be optimistic.,Spread the ideas. Spread the light.,Thank you.,(Applause)In his inaugural address,,Barack Obama appealed to each of us to give our best,as we try to extricate ourselves from this current financial crisis.,But what did he appeal to?,He did not, happily, follow in the footsteps of his predecessor,,and tell us to just go shopping.,Nor did he tell us, "Trust us. Trust your country.,Invest, invest, invest.",Instead, what he told us was to put aside childish things.,And he appealed to virtue.,Virtue is an old-fashioned word.,It seems a little out of place in a cutting-edge environment like this one.,And besides, some of you might be wondering,,what the hell does it mean? 
 Let me begin with an example.,This is the job description of a hospital janitor,that is scrolling up on the screen.,And all of the items on it are unremarkable.,They're the things you would expect:,mop the floors, sweep them, empty the trash, restock the cabinets.,It may be a little surprising how many things there are,,but it's not surprising what they are.,But the one thing I want you to notice about them is this:,even though this is a very long list,,there isn't a single thing on it that involves other human beings.,Not one.,The janitor's job could just as well be done in a mortuary as in a hospital. 
 And yet, when some psychologists interviewed hospital janitors,to get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like,,they encountered Mike,,who told them about how he stopped mopping the floor,because Mr. Jones was out of his bed getting a little exercise,,trying to build up his strength, walking slowly up and down the hall.,And Charlene told them about how she ignored her supervisor's admonition,and didn't vacuum the visitor's lounge,because there were some family members who were there all day, every day,who, at this moment, happened to be taking a nap.,And then there was Luke,,who washed the floor in a comatose young man's room twice,because the man's father, who had been keeping a vigil for six months,,didn't see Luke do it the first time,,and his father was angry.,And behavior like this from janitors, from technicians, from nurses,and, if we're lucky now and then, from doctors,,doesn't just make people feel a little better,,it actually improves the quality of patient care,and enables hospitals to run well. 
 Now, not all janitors are like this, of course.,But the ones who are think that these sorts of human interactions,involving kindness, care and empathy,are an essential part of the job.,And yet their job description contains not one word about other human beings.,These janitors have the moral will to do right by other people.,And beyond this, they have the moral skill to figure out what "doing right" means. 
 "Practical wisdom," Aristotle told us,,"is the combination of moral will and moral skill.",A wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule,,as the janitors knew when to ignore the job duties in the service of other objectives.,A wise person knows how to improvise,,as Luke did when he re-washed the floor.,Real-world problems are often ambiguous and ill-defined,and the context is always changing.,A wise person is like a jazz musician --,using the notes on the page, but dancing around them,,inventing combinations that are appropriate for the situation and the people at hand.,A wise person knows how to use these moral skills,in the service of the right aims.,To serve other people, not to manipulate other people.,And finally, perhaps most important,,a wise person is made, not born.,Wisdom depends on experience,,and not just any experience.,You need the time to get to know the people that you're serving.,You need permission to be allowed to improvise,,try new things, occasionally to fail and to learn from your failures.,And you need to be mentored by wise teachers. 
 When you ask the janitors who behaved like the ones I described,how hard it is to learn to do their job,,they tell you that it takes lots of experience.,And they don't mean it takes lots of experience to learn how to mop floors and empty trash cans.,It takes lots of experience to learn how to care for people.,At TED, brilliance is rampant.,It's scary.,The good news is you don't need to be brilliant to be wise.,The bad news is that without wisdom,,brilliance isn't enough.,It's as likely to get you and other people into trouble as anything else.,(Applause) 
 Now, I hope that we all know this.,There's a sense in which it's obvious,,and yet, let me tell you a little story.,It's a story about lemonade.,A dad and his seven-year-old son were watching a Detroit Tigers game at the ballpark.,His son asked him for some lemonade,and Dad went to the concession stand to buy it.,All they had was Mike's Hard Lemonade,,which was five percent alcohol.,Dad, being an academic, had no idea that Mike's Hard Lemonade contained alcohol.,So he brought it back.,And the kid was drinking it, and a security guard spotted it,,and called the police, who called an ambulance,that rushed to the ballpark, whisked the kid to the hospital.,The emergency room ascertained that the kid had no alcohol in his blood.,And they were ready to let the kid go. 
 But not so fast.,The Wayne County Child Welfare Protection Agency said no.,And the child was sent to a foster home for three days.,At that point, can the child go home?,Well, a judge said yes, but only if the dad leaves the house and checks into a motel.,After two weeks, I'm happy to report,,the family was reunited.,But the welfare workers and the ambulance people,and the judge all said the same thing:,"We hate to do it but we have to follow procedure." 
 How do things like this happen?,Scott Simon, who told this story on NPR,,said, "Rules and procedures may be dumb,,but they spare you from thinking.",And, to be fair, rules are often imposed,because previous officials have been lax,and they let a child go back to an abusive household.,Fair enough.,When things go wrong, as of course they do,,we reach for two tools to try to fix them. 
 One tool we reach for is rules.,Better ones, more of them.,The second tool we reach for is incentives.,Better ones, more of them.,What else, after all, is there?,We can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis.,Regulate, regulate, regulate.,Fix the incentives, fix the incentives, fix the incentives ...,The truth is that neither rules nor incentives,are enough to do the job.,How could you even write a rule that got the janitors to do what they did?,And would you pay them a bonus for being empathic?,It's preposterous on its face.,And what happens is that as we turn increasingly to rules,,rules and incentives may make things better in the short run,,but they create a downward spiral,that makes them worse in the long run.,Moral skill is chipped away by an over-reliance on rules,that deprives us of the opportunity,to improvise and learn from our improvisations.,And moral will is undermined,by an incessant appeal to incentives,that destroy our desire to do the right thing.,And without intending it,,by appealing to rules and incentives,,we are engaging in a war on wisdom. 
 Let me just give you a few examples,,first of rules and the war on moral skill.,The lemonade story is one.,Second, no doubt more familiar to you,,is the nature of modern American education:,scripted, lock-step curricula.,Here's an example from Chicago kindergarten.,Reading and enjoying literature,and words that begin with 'B.',"The Bath:" Assemble students on a rug,and give students a warning about the dangers of hot water.,Say 75 items in this script to teach a 25-page picture book.,All over Chicago in every kindergarten class in the city,,every teacher is saying the same words in the same way on the same day.,We know why these scripts are there.,We don't trust the judgment of teachers enough,to let them loose on their own.,Scripts like these are insurance policies against disaster.,And they prevent disaster.,But what they assure in its place is mediocrity.,(Applause) 
 Don't get me wrong. We need rules!,Jazz musicians need some notes --,most of them need some notes on the page.,We need more rules for the bankers, God knows.,But too many rules prevent accomplished jazz musicians,from improvising.,And as a result, they lose their gifts,,or worse, they stop playing altogether. 
 Now, how about incentives?,They seem cleverer.,If you have one reason for doing something,and I give you a second reason for doing the same thing,,it seems only logical that two reasons are better than one,and you're more likely to do it.,Right?,Well, not always.,Sometimes two reasons to do the same thing seem to compete with one another,instead of complimenting,,and they make people less likely to do it. 
 I'll just give you one example because time is racing.,In Switzerland, back about 15 years ago,,they were trying to decide where to site nuclear waste dumps.,There was going to be a national referendum.,Some psychologists went around and polled citizens who were very well informed.,And they said, "Would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community?",Astonishingly, 50 percent of the citizens said yes.,They knew it was dangerous.,They thought it would reduce their property values.,But it had to go somewhere,and they had responsibilities as citizens.,The psychologists asked other people a slightly different question.,They said, "If we paid you six weeks' salary every year,would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community?",Two reasons. It's my responsibility and I'm getting paid.,Instead of 50 percent saying yes,,25 percent said yes.,What happens is that,the second this introduction of incentive gets us,so that instead of asking, "What is my responsibility?",all we ask is, "What serves my interests?",When incentives don't work,,when CEOs ignore the long-term health of their companies,in pursuit of short-term gains that will lead to massive bonuses,,the response is always the same.,Get smarter incentives. 
 The truth is that there are no incentives that you can devise,that are ever going to be smart enough.,Any incentive system can be subverted by bad will.,We need incentives. People have to make a living.,But excessive reliance on incentives,demoralizes professional activity,in two senses of that word.,It causes people who engage in that activity to lose morale,and it causes the activity itself to lose morality. 
 Barack Obama said, before he was inaugurated,,"We must ask not just 'Is it profitable?' but 'Is it right?'",And when professions are demoralized,,everyone in them becomes dependent on -- addicted to -- incentives,and they stop asking "Is it right?",We see this in medicine.,("Although it's nothing serious, let's keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn't turn into a major lawsuit."),And we certainly see it in the world of business.,("In order to remain competitive in today's marketplace, I'm afraid we're going to have to replace you with a sleezeball."),("I sold my soul for about a tenth of what the damn things are going for now."),It is obvious that this is not the way people want to do their work. 
 So what can we do?,A few sources of hope:,we ought to try to re-moralize work.,One way not to do it: teach more ethics courses.,(Applause),There is no better way to show people that you're not serious,than to tie up everything you have to say about ethics,into a little package with a bow and consign it to the margins as an ethics course. 
 What to do instead?,One: Celebrate moral exemplars.,Acknowledge, when you go to law school,,that a little voice is whispering in your ear,about Atticus Finch.,No 10-year-old goes to law school to do mergers and acquisitions.,People are inspired by moral heroes.,But we learn that with sophistication,comes the understanding that you can't acknowledge that you have moral heroes.,Well, acknowledge them.,Be proud that you have them.,Celebrate them.,And demand that the people who teach you acknowledge them and celebrate them too.,That's one thing we can do. 
 I don't know how many of you remember this:,another moral hero, 15 years ago, Aaron Feuerstein,,who was the head of Malden Mills in Massachusetts --,they made Polartec --,The factory burned down.,3,000 employees. He kept every one of them on the payroll.,Why? Because it would have been a disaster for them,and for the community if he had let them go.,"Maybe on paper our company is worth less to Wall Street,,but I can tell you it's worth more. We're doing fine." 
 Just at this TED we heard talks from several moral heroes.,Two were particularly inspiring to me.,One was Ray Anderson, who turned --,(Applause),-- turned, you know, a part of the evil empire,into a zero-footprint, or almost zero-footprint business.,Why? Because it was the right thing to do.,And a bonus he's discovering is,he's actually going to make even more money.,His employees are inspired by the effort.,Why? Because there happy to be doing something that's the right thing to do.,Yesterday we heard Willie Smits talk about re-foresting in Indonesia.,(Applause) 
 In many ways this is the perfect example.,Because it took the will to do the right thing.,God knows it took a huge amount of technical skill.,I'm boggled at how much he and his associates needed to know,in order to plot this out.,But most important to make it work --,and he emphasized this --,is that it took knowing the people in the communities.,Unless the people you're working with are behind you,,this will fail.,And there isn't a formula to tell you how to get the people behind you,,because different people in different communities,organize their lives in different ways. 
 So there's a lot here at TED, and at other places, to celebrate.,And you don't have to be a mega-hero.,There are ordinary heroes.,Ordinary heroes like the janitors who are worth celebrating too.,As practitioners each and every one of us should strive,to be ordinary, if not extraordinary heroes.,As heads of organizations,,we should strive to create environments,that encourage and nurture both moral skill and moral will.,Even the wisest and most well-meaning people,will give up if they have to swim against the current,in the organizations in which they work. 
 If you run an organization, you should be sure,that none of the jobs -- none of the jobs --,have job descriptions like the job descriptions of the janitors.,Because the truth is that,any work that you do that involves interaction with other people,is moral work.,And any moral work depends upon practical wisdom. 
 And, perhaps most important,,as teachers, we should strive to be the ordinary heroes,,the moral exemplars, to the people we mentor.,And there are a few things that we have to remember as teachers.,One is that we are always teaching.,Someone is always watching.,The camera is always on.,Bill Gates talked about the importance of education,and, in particular, the model that KIPP was providing:,"Knowledge is power.",And he talked about a lot of the wonderful things,that KIPP is doing,to take inner-city kids and turn them in the direction of college. 
 I want to focus on one particular thing KIPP is doing,that Bill didn't mention.,That is that they have come to the realization,that the single most important thing kids need to learn,is character.,They need to learn to respect themselves.,They need to learn to respect their schoolmates.,They need to learn to respect their teachers.,And, most important, they need to learn to respect learning.,That's the principle objective.,If you do that, the rest is just pretty much a coast downhill.,And the teachers: the way you teach these things to the kids,is by having the teachers and all the other staff embody it every minute of every day. 
 Obama appealed to virtue.,And I think he was right.,And the virtue I think we need above all others is practical wisdom,,because it's what allows other virtues -- honesty, kindness, courage and so on --,to be displayed at the right time and in the right way.,He also appealed to hope.,Right again.,I think there is reason for hope.,I think people want to be allowed to be virtuous. 
 In many ways, it's what TED is all about.,Wanting to do the right thing,in the right way,for the right reasons.,This kind of wisdom is within the grasp of each and every one of us,if only we start paying attention.,Paying attention to what we do,,to how we do it,,and, perhaps most importantly,,to the structure of the organizations within which we work,,so as to make sure that it enables us and other people to develop wisdom,rather than having it suppressed. 
 Thank you very much.,Thank you.,(Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: You have to go and stand out here a sec. 
 Barry Schwartz: Thank you very much.,(Applause)What I'm going to try to do is explain to you,quickly how to predict,,and illustrate it with some predictions,about what Iran is going to do in the next couple of years. 
 In order to predict effectively,,we need to use science.,And the reason that we need to use science,is because then we can reproduce what we're doing;,it's not just wisdom or guesswork.,And if we can predict,,then we can engineer the future.,So if you are concerned to influence energy policy,,or you are concerned to influence national security policy,,or health policy, or education,,science -- and a particular branch of science -- is a way to do it,,not the way we've been doing it,,which is seat-of-the-pants wisdom. 
 Now before I get into how to do it,let me give you a little truth in advertising,,because I'm not engaged in the business of magic.,There are lots of thing that the approach I take can predict,,and there are some that it can't.,It can predict complex negotiations,or situations involving coercion --,that is in essence everything that has to do with politics,,much of what has to do with business,,but sorry, if you're looking to speculate in the stock market,,I don't predict stock markets -- OK,,it's not going up any time really soon.,But I'm not engaged in doing that.,I'm not engaged in predicting random number generators.,I actually get phone calls from people,who want to know what lottery numbers are going to win.,I don't have a clue. 
 I engage in the use of game theory, game theory is a branch of mathematics,and that means, sorry, that even in the study of politics,,math has come into the picture.,We can no longer pretend that we just speculate about politics,,we need to look at this in a rigorous way.,Now, what is game theory about?,It assumes that people are looking out for what's good for them.,That doesn't seem terribly shocking --,although it's controversial for a lot of people --,that we are self-interested.,In order to look out for what's best for them,or what they think is best for them,,people have values -- they identify what they want, and what they don't want.,And they have beliefs about what other people want,,and what other people don't want, how much power other people have,,how much those people could get in the way of whatever it is that you want.,And they face limitations, constraints,,they may be weak, they may be located in the wrong part of the world,,they may be Einstein, stuck away farming,someplace in a rural village in India not being noticed,,as was the case for Ramanujan for a long time,,a great mathematician but nobody noticed. 
 Now who is rational?,A lot of people are worried about what is rationality about?,You know, what if people are rational?,Mother Theresa, she was rational.,Terrorists, they're rational.,Pretty much everybody is rational.,I think there are only two exceptions that I'm aware of --,two-year-olds, they are not rational,,they have very fickle preferences,,they switch what they think all the time,,and schizophrenics are probably not rational,,but pretty much everybody else is rational.,That is, they are just trying to do,what they think is in their own best interest. 
 Now in order to work out what people are going to do,to pursue their interests,,we have to think about who has influence in the world.,If you're trying to influence corporations to change their behavior,,with regard to producing pollutants,,one approach, the common approach,,is to exhort them to be better,,to explain to them what damage they're doing to the planet.,And many of you may have noticed that doesn't have,as big an effect, as perhaps you would like it to have.,But if you show them that it's in their interest,,then they're responsive. 
 So, we have to work out who influences problems.,If we're looking at Iran, the president of the United States,we would like to think, may have some influence --,certainly the president in Iran has some influence --,but we make a mistake if we just pay attention,to the person at the top of the power ladder,because that person doesn't know much about Iran,,or about energy policy,,or about health care,,or about any particular policy.,That person surrounds himself or herself with advisers.,If we're talking about national security problems,,maybe it's the Secretary of State,,maybe it's the Secretary of Defense,,the Director of National Intelligence,,maybe the ambassador to the United Nations, or somebody else,who they think is going to know more about the particular problem.,But let's face it, the Secretary of State doesn't know much about Iran.,The secretary of defense doesn't know much about Iran.,Each of those people in turn,has advisers who advise them,,so they can advise the president.,There are lots of people shaping decisions,and so if we want to predict correctly,we have to pay attention to everybody,who is trying to shape the outcome,,not just the people at the pinnacle,of the decision-making pyramid. 
 Unfortunately, a lot of times we don't do that.,There's a good reason that we don't do that,,and there's a good reason that using game theory and computers,,we can overcome the limitation,of just looking at a few people.,Imagine a problem with just five decision-makers.,Imagine for example,that Sally over here,,wants to know what Harry, and Jane,,and George and Frank are thinking,,and sends messages to those people.,Sally's giving her opinion to them,,and they're giving their opinion to Sally.,But Sally also wants to know,what Harry is saying to these three,,and what they're saying to Harry.,And Harry wants to know,what each of those people are saying to each other, and so on,,and Sally would like to know what Harry thinks those people are saying.,That's a complicated problem; that's a lot to know.,With five decision-makers,there are a lot of linkages --,120, as a matter of fact,,if you remember your factorials.,Five factorial is 120.,Now you may be surprised to know,that smart people can keep 120 things straight,in their head.,Suppose we double the number of influencers,from five to 10.,Does that mean we've doubled the number of pieces of information,we need to know, from 120 to 240?,No. How about 10 times?,To 1,200? No.,We've increased it to 3.6 million.,Nobody can keep that straight in their head.,But computers,,they can. They don't need coffee breaks,,they don't need vacations,,they don't need to go to sleep at night,,they don't ask for raises either.,They can keep this information straight,and that means that we can process the information. 
 So I'm going to talk to you about how to process it,,and I'm going to give you some examples out of Iran,,and you're going to be wondering,,"Why should we listen to this guy?,Why should we believe what he's saying?",So I'm going to show you a factoid.,This is an assessment by the Central Intelligence Agency,of the percentage of time,that the model I'm talking about,is right in predicting things whose outcome is not yet known,,when the experts who provided the data inputs,got it wrong.,That's not my claim, that's a CIA claim -- you can read it,,it was declassified a while ago. You can read it in a volume edited by,H. Bradford Westerfield, Yale University Press. 
 So, what do we need to know,in order to predict?,You may be surprised to find out we don't need to know very much.,We do need to know who has a stake,in trying to shape the outcome of a decision.,We need to know what they say they want,,not what they want in their heart of hearts,,not what they think they can get,,but what they say they want, because that is a strategically chosen position,,and we can work backwards from that,to draw inferences about important features of their decision-making.,We need to know how focused they are,on the problem at hand.,That is, how willing are they to drop what they're doing when the issue comes up,,and attend to it instead of something else that's on their plate --,how big a deal is it to them?,And how much clout could they bring to bear,if they chose to engage on the issue? 
 If we know those things,we can predict their behavior by assuming that everybody,cares about two things on any decision.,They care about the outcome. They'd like an outcome as close to,what they are interested in as possible.,They're careerists, they also care about getting credit --,there's ego involvement,,they want to be seen as important in shaping the outcome,,or as important, if it's their druthers, to block an outcome.,And so we have to figure out how they balance those two things.,Different people trade off,between standing by their outcome,,faithfully holding to it, going down in a blaze of glory,,or giving it up, putting their finger in the wind,,and doing whatever they think is going to be a winning position.,Most people fall in between, and if we can work out where they fall,we can work out how to negotiate with them,to change their behavior. 
 So with just that little bit of input,we can work out what the choices are that people have,,what the chances are that they're willing to take,,what they're after, what they value, what they want,,and what they believe about other people.,You might notice what we don't need to know:,there's no history in here.,How they got to where they are,may be important in shaping the input information,,but once we know where they are,we're worried about where they're going to be headed in the future.,How they got there turns out not to be terribly critical in predicting.,I remind you of that 90 percent accuracy rate. 
 So where are we going to get this information?,We can get this information,from the Internet, from The Economist,,The Financial Times, The New York Times,,U.S. News and World Report, lots of sources like that,,or we can get it from asking experts,who spend their lives studying places and problems,,because those experts know this information.,If they don't know, who are the people trying to influence the decision,,how much clout do they have,,how much they care about this issue, and what do they say they want,,are they experts? That's what it means to be an expert,,that's the basic stuff an expert needs to know. 
 Alright, lets turn to Iran.,Let me make three important predictions --,you can check this out, time will tell.,What is Iran going to do about its nuclear weapons program?,How secure is the theocratic regime in Iran?,What's its future?,And everybody's best friend,,Ahmadinejad. How are things going for him?,How are things going to be working out for him in the next year or two?,You take a look at this, this is not based on statistics.,I want to be very clear here. I'm not projecting some past data into the future.,I've taken inputs on positions and so forth,,run it through a computer model,that had simulated the dynamics of interaction,,and these are the simulated dynamics,,the predictions about the path of policy. 
 So you can see here on the vertical axis,,I haven't shown it all the way down to zero,,there are lots of other options, but here I'm just showing you the prediction,,so I've narrowed the scale.,Up at the top of the axis, "Build the Bomb.",At 130, we start somewhere above 130,,between building a bomb, and making enough weapons-grade fuel,so that you could build a bomb.,That's where, according to my analyses,,the Iranians were at the beginning of this year.,And then the model makes predictions down the road.,At 115 they would only produce enough weapons grade fuel,to show that they know how, but they wouldn't build a weapon:,they would build a research quantity.,It would achieve some national pride,,but not go ahead and build a weapon.,And down at 100 they would build civilian nuclear energy,,which is what they say is their objective. 
 The yellow line shows us the most likely path.,The yellow line includes an analysis,of 87 decision makers in Iran,,and a vast number of outside influencers,trying to pressure Iran into changing its behavior,,various players in the United States, and Egypt,,and Saudi Arabia, and Russia, European Union,,Japan, so on and so forth.,The white line reproduces the analysis,if the international environment,just left Iran to make its own internal decisions,,under its own domestic political pressures.,That's not going to be happening,,but you can see that the line comes down faster,if they're not put under international pressure,,if they're allowed to pursue their own devices. 
 But in any event, by the end of this year,,beginning of next year, we get to a stable equilibrium outcome.,And that equilibrium is not what the United States would like,,but it's probably an equilibrium that the United States can live with,,and that a lot of others can live with.,And that is that Iran will achieve that nationalist pride,by making enough weapons-grade fuel, through research,,so that they could show that they know how to make weapons-grade fuel,,but not enough to actually build a bomb.,How is this happening?,Over here you can see this is the distribution,of power in favor of civilian nuclear energy today,,this is what that power block is predicted to be like,by the late parts of 2010, early parts of 2011.,Just about nobody supports research on weapons-grade fuel today,,but by 2011 that gets to be a big block,,and you put these two together, that's the controlling influence in Iran. 
 Out here today, there are a bunch of people --,Ahmadinejad for example --,who would like not only to build a bomb,,but test a bomb.,That power disappears completely;,nobody supports that by 2011.,These guys are all shrinking,,the power is all drifting out here,,so the outcome is going to be the weapons-grade fuel. 
 Who are the winners and who are the losers in Iran?,Take a look at these guys, they're growing in power,,and by the way, this was done a while ago,before the current economic crisis,,and that's probably going to get steeper.,These folks are the moneyed interests in Iran,,the bankers, the oil people, the bazaaries.,They are growing in political clout,,as the mullahs are isolating themselves --,with the exception of one group of mullahs,,who are not well known to Americans.,That's this line here, growing in power,,these are what the Iranians call the quietists.,These are the Ayatollahs, mostly based in Qom,,who have great clout in the religious community,,have been quiet on politics and are going to be getting louder,,because they see Iran going in an unhealthy direction,,a direction contrary,to what Khomeini had in mind.,Here is Mr. Ahmadinejad.,Two things to notice: he's getting weaker,,and while he gets a lot of attention in the United States,,he is not a major player in Iran.,He is on the way down. 
 OK, so I'd like you to take a little away from this.,Everything is not predictable: the stock market,is, at least for me, not predictable,,but most complicated negotiations are predictable.,Again, whether we're talking health policy, education,,environment, energy,,litigation, mergers,,all of these are complicated problems,that are predictable,,that this sort of technology can be applied to.,And the reason that being able to predict those things is important,,is not just because you might run a hedge fund and make money off of it,,but because if you can predict what people will do,,you can engineer what they will do.,And if you engineer what they do you can change the world,,you can get a better result.,I would like to leave you with one thought, which is,for me, the dominant theme of this gathering,,and is the dominant theme of this way of thinking about the world.,When people say to you,,"That's impossible,",you say back to them,,"When you say 'That's impossible,',you're confused with,,'I don't know how to do it.'",Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: One question for you.,That was fascinating.,I love that you put it out there.,I got very nervous halfway through the talk though,,just panicking whether you'd included in your model, the possibility that,putting this prediction out there might change the result.,We've got 800 people in Tehran who watch TEDTalks. 
 Bruce Bueno de Mesquita: I've thought about that,,and since I've done a lot of work for the intelligence community,,they've also pondered that.,It would be a good thing if,people paid more attention, took seriously,,and engaged in the same sorts of calculations,,because it would change things. But it would change things in two beneficial ways.,It would hasten how quickly people arrive at an agreement,,and so it would save everybody a lot of grief and time.,And, it would arrive at an agreement that everybody was happy with,,without having to manipulate them so much --,which is basically what I do, I manipulate them.,So it would be a good thing. 
 CA: So you're kind of trying to say, "People of Iran, this is your destiny, lets go there." 
 BBM: Well, people of Iran, this is what many of you are going to evolve to want,,and we could get there a lot sooner,,and you would suffer a lot less trouble from economic sanctions,,and we would suffer a lot less fear of the use of military force on our end,,and the world would be a better place. 
 CA: Here's hoping they hear it that way. Thank you very much Bruce. 
 BBM: Thank you. 
 (Applause)I want to talk to you today a little bit,about predictable irrationality.,And my interest in irrational behavior,started many years ago in the hospital.,I was burned very badly.,And if you spend a lot of time in hospital,,you'll see a lot of types of irrationalities.,And the one that particularly bothered me in the burn department,was the process by which the nurses took the bandage off me.,Now, you must have all taken a Band-Aid off at some point,,and you must have wondered what's the right approach.,Do you rip it off quickly -- short duration but high intensity --,or do you take your Band-Aid off slowly --,you take a long time, but each second is not as painful --,which one of those is the right approach? 
 The nurses in my department thought that the right approach,was the ripping one, so they would grab hold and they would rip,,and they would grab hold and they would rip.,And because I had 70 percent of my body burned, it would take about an hour.,And as you can imagine,,I hated that moment of ripping with incredible intensity.,And I would try to reason with them and say,,"Why don't we try something else?,Why don't we take it a little longer --,maybe two hours instead of an hour -- and have less of this intensity?",And the nurses told me two things.,They told me that they had the right model of the patient --,that they knew what was the right thing to do to minimize my pain --,and they also told me that the word patient doesn't mean,to make suggestions or to interfere or ...,This is not just in Hebrew, by the way.,It's in every language I've had experience with so far. 
 And, you know, there's not much -- there wasn't much I could do,,and they kept on doing what they were doing.,And about three years later, when I left the hospital,,I started studying at the university.,And one of the most interesting lessons I learned,was that there is an experimental method,that if you have a question you can create a replica of this question,in some abstract way, and you can try to examine this question,,maybe learn something about the world. 
 So that's what I did.,I was still interested,in this question of how do you take bandages off burn patients.,So originally I didn't have much money,,so I went to a hardware store and I bought a carpenter's vice.,And I would bring people to the lab and I would put their finger in it,,and I would crunch it a little bit. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I would crunch it for long periods and short periods,,and pain that went up and pain that went down,,and with breaks and without breaks -- all kinds of versions of pain.,And when I finished hurting people a little bit, I would ask them,,so, how painful was this? Or, how painful was this?,Or, if you had to choose between the last two,,which one would you choose? 
 (Laughter) 
 I kept on doing this for a while. 
 (Laughter) 
 And then, like all good academic projects, I got more funding.,I moved to sounds, electrical shocks --,I even had a pain suit that I could get people to feel much more pain. 
 But at the end of this process,,what I learned was that the nurses were wrong.,Here were wonderful people with good intentions,and plenty of experience, and nevertheless,they were getting things wrong predictably all the time.,It turns out that because we don't encode duration,in the way that we encode intensity,,I would have had less pain if the duration would have been longer,and the intensity was lower.,It turns out it would have been better to start with my face,,which was much more painful, and move toward my legs,,giving me a trend of improvement over time --,that would have been also less painful.,And it also turns out that it would have been good,to give me breaks in the middle to kind of recuperate from the pain.,All of these would have been great things to do,,and my nurses had no idea. 
 And from that point on I started thinking,,are the nurses the only people in the world who get things wrong,in this particular decision, or is it a more general case?,And it turns out it's a more general case --,there's a lot of mistakes we do.,And I want to give you one example of one of these irrationalities,,and I want to talk to you about cheating.,And the reason I picked cheating is because it's interesting,,but also it tells us something, I think,,about the stock market situation we're in.,So, my interest in cheating started,when Enron came on the scene, exploded all of a sudden,,and I started thinking about what is happening here.,Is it the case that there was kind of,a few apples who are capable of doing these things,,or are we talking a more endemic situation,,that many people are actually capable of behaving this way? 
 So, like we usually do, I decided to do a simple experiment.,And here's how it went.,If you were in the experiment, I would pass you a sheet of paper,with 20 simple math problems that everybody could solve,,but I wouldn't give you enough time.,When the five minutes were over, I would say,,"Pass me the sheets of paper, and I'll pay you a dollar per question.",People did this. I would pay people four dollars for their task --,on average people would solve four problems.,Other people I would tempt to cheat.,I would pass their sheet of paper.,When the five minutes were over, I would say,,"Please shred the piece of paper.,Put the little pieces in your pocket or in your backpack,,and tell me how many questions you got correctly.",People now solved seven questions on average.,Now, it wasn't as if there was a few bad apples --,a few people cheated a lot.,Instead, what we saw is a lot of people who cheat a little bit. 
 Now, in economic theory,,cheating is a very simple cost-benefit analysis.,You say, what's the probability of being caught?,How much do I stand to gain from cheating?,And how much punishment would I get if I get caught?,And you weigh these options out --,you do the simple cost-benefit analysis,,and you decide whether it's worthwhile to commit the crime or not.,So, we try to test this.,For some people, we varied how much money they could get away with --,how much money they could steal.,We paid them 10 cents per correct question, 50 cents,,a dollar, five dollars, 10 dollars per correct question. 
 You would expect that as the amount of money on the table increases,,people would cheat more, but in fact it wasn't the case.,We got a lot of people cheating by stealing by a little bit.,What about the probability of being caught?,Some people shredded half the sheet of paper,,so there was some evidence left.,Some people shredded the whole sheet of paper.,Some people shredded everything, went out of the room,,and paid themselves from the bowl of money that had over 100 dollars.,You would expect that as the probability of being caught goes down,,people would cheat more, but again, this was not the case.,Again, a lot of people cheated by just by a little bit,,and they were insensitive to these economic incentives. 
 So we said, "If people are not sensitive,to the economic rational theory explanations, to these forces,,what could be going on?",And we thought maybe what is happening is that there are two forces.,At one hand, we all want to look at ourselves in the mirror,and feel good about ourselves, so we don't want to cheat.,On the other hand, we can cheat a little bit,,and still feel good about ourselves.,So, maybe what is happening is that,there's a level of cheating we can't go over,,but we can still benefit from cheating at a low degree,,as long as it doesn't change our impressions about ourselves.,We call this like a personal fudge factor. 
 Now, how would you test a personal fudge factor?,Initially we said, what can we do to shrink the fudge factor?,So, we got people to the lab, and we said,,"We have two tasks for you today.",First, we asked half the people,to recall either 10 books they read in high school,,or to recall The Ten Commandments,,and then we tempted them with cheating.,Turns out the people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments --,and in our sample nobody could recall all of The Ten Commandments --,but those people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments,,given the opportunity to cheat, did not cheat at all.,It wasn't that the more religious people --,the people who remembered more of the Commandments -- cheated less,,and the less religious people --,the people who couldn't remember almost any Commandments --,cheated more.,The moment people thought about trying to recall The Ten Commandments,,they stopped cheating.,In fact, even when we gave self-declared atheists,the task of swearing on the Bible and we give them a chance to cheat,,they don't cheat at all.,Now, Ten Commandments is something that is hard,to bring into the education system, so we said,,"Why don't we get people to sign the honor code?",So, we got people to sign,,"I understand that this short survey falls under the MIT Honor Code.",Then they shredded it. No cheating whatsoever.,And this is particularly interesting,,because MIT doesn't have an honor code.,(Laughter) 
 So, all this was about decreasing the fudge factor.,What about increasing the fudge factor?,The first experiment -- I walked around MIT,and I distributed six-packs of Cokes in the refrigerators --,these were common refrigerators for the undergrads.,And I came back to measure what we technically call,the half-lifetime of Coke -- how long does it last in the refrigerators?,As you can expect it doesn't last very long; people take it.,In contrast, I took a plate with six one-dollar bills,,and I left those plates in the same refrigerators.,No bill ever disappeared. 
 Now, this is not a good social science experiment,,so to do it better I did the same experiment,as I described to you before.,A third of the people we passed the sheet, they gave it back to us.,A third of the people we passed it to, they shredded it,,they came to us and said,,"Mr. Experimenter, I solved X problems. Give me X dollars.",A third of the people, when they finished shredding the piece of paper,,they came to us and said,,"Mr Experimenter, I solved X problems. Give me X tokens.",We did not pay them with dollars; we paid them with something else.,And then they took the something else, they walked 12 feet to the side,,and exchanged it for dollars. 
 Think about the following intuition.,How bad would you feel about taking a pencil from work home,,compared to how bad would you feel,about taking 10 cents from a petty cash box?,These things feel very differently.,Would being a step removed from cash for a few seconds,by being paid by token make a difference?,Our subjects doubled their cheating.,I'll tell you what I think,about this and the stock market in a minute.,But this did not solve the big problem I had with Enron yet,,because in Enron, there's also a social element.,People see each other behaving.,In fact, every day when we open the news,we see examples of people cheating.,What does this cause us? 
 So, we did another experiment.,We got a big group of students to be in the experiment,,and we prepaid them.,So everybody got an envelope with all the money for the experiment,,and we told them that at the end, we asked them,to pay us back the money they didn't make. OK?,The same thing happens.,When we give people the opportunity to cheat, they cheat.,They cheat just by a little bit, all the same.,But in this experiment we also hired an acting student.,This acting student stood up after 30 seconds, and said,,"I solved everything. What do I do now?",And the experimenter said, "If you've finished everything, go home.,That's it. The task is finished.",So, now we had a student -- an acting student --,that was a part of the group.,Nobody knew it was an actor.,And they clearly cheated in a very, very serious way.,What would happen to the other people in the group?,Will they cheat more, or will they cheat less? 
 Here is what happens.,It turns out it depends on what kind of sweatshirt they're wearing.,Here is the thing.,We ran this at Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh.,And at Pittsburgh there are two big universities,,Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh.,All of the subjects sitting in the experiment,were Carnegie Mellon students.,When the actor who was getting up was a Carnegie Mellon student --,he was actually a Carnegie Mellon student --,but he was a part of their group, cheating went up.,But when he actually had a University of Pittsburgh sweatshirt,,cheating went down. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, this is important, because remember,,when the moment the student stood up,,it made it clear to everybody that they could get away with cheating,,because the experimenter said,,"You've finished everything. Go home," and they went with the money.,So it wasn't so much about the probability of being caught again.,It was about the norms for cheating.,If somebody from our in-group cheats and we see them cheating,,we feel it's more appropriate, as a group, to behave this way.,But if it's somebody from another group, these terrible people --,I mean, not terrible in this --,but somebody we don't want to associate ourselves with,,from another university, another group,,all of a sudden people's awareness of honesty goes up --,a little bit like The Ten Commandments experiment --,and people cheat even less. 
 So, what have we learned from this about cheating?,We've learned that a lot of people can cheat.,They cheat just by a little bit.,When we remind people about their morality, they cheat less.,When we get bigger distance from cheating,,from the object of money, for example, people cheat more.,And when we see cheating around us,,particularly if it's a part of our in-group, cheating goes up.,Now, if we think about this in terms of the stock market,,think about what happens.,What happens in a situation when you create something,where you pay people a lot of money,to see reality in a slightly distorted way?,Would they not be able to see it this way?,Of course they would.,What happens when you do other things,,like you remove things from money?,You call them stock, or stock options, derivatives,,mortgage-backed securities.,Could it be that with those more distant things,,it's not a token for one second,,it's something that is many steps removed from money,for a much longer time -- could it be that people will cheat even more?,And what happens to the social environment,when people see other people behave around them?,I think all of those forces worked in a very bad way,in the stock market. 
 More generally, I want to tell you something,about behavioral economics.,We have many intuitions in our life,,and the point is that many of these intuitions are wrong.,The question is, are we going to test those intuitions?,We can think about how we're going to test this intuition,in our private life, in our business life,,and most particularly when it goes to policy,,when we think about things like No Child Left Behind,,when you create new stock markets, when you create other policies --,taxation, health care and so on.,And the difficulty of testing our intuition,was the big lesson I learned,when I went back to the nurses to talk to them. 
 So I went back to talk to them,and tell them what I found out about removing bandages.,And I learned two interesting things.,One was that my favorite nurse, Ettie,,told me that I did not take her pain into consideration.,She said, "Of course, you know, it was very painful for you.,But think about me as a nurse,,taking, removing the bandages of somebody I liked,,and had to do it repeatedly over a long period of time.,Creating so much torture was not something that was good for me, too.",And she said maybe part of the reason was it was difficult for her.,But it was actually more interesting than that, because she said,,"I did not think that your intuition was right.,I felt my intuition was correct.",So, if you think about all of your intuitions,,it's very hard to believe that your intuition is wrong.,And she said, "Given the fact that I thought my intuition was right ..." --,she thought her intuition was right --,it was very difficult for her to accept doing a difficult experiment,to try and check whether she was wrong. 
 But in fact, this is the situation we're all in all the time.,We have very strong intuitions about all kinds of things --,our own ability, how the economy works,,how we should pay school teachers.,But unless we start testing those intuitions,,we're not going to do better.,And just think about how better my life would have been,if these nurses would have been willing to check their intuition,,and how everything would have been better,if we just start doing more systematic experimentation of our intuitions. 
 Thank you very much.College presidents are not the first people who come to mind,when the subject is the uses of the creative imagination.,So I thought I'd start by telling you how I got here. 
 The story begins in the late '90s.,I was invited to meet with leading educators,from the newly free Eastern Europe and Russia.,They were trying to figure out how to rebuild their universities.,Since education under the Soviet Union,was essentially propaganda,serving the purposes of a state ideology,,they appreciated that it would take wholesale transformations,if they were to provide an education,worthy of free men and women.,Given this rare opportunity,to start fresh,,they chose liberal arts,as the most compelling model,because of its historic commitment,to furthering its students' broadest intellectual,,and deepest ethical potential. 
 Having made that decision,they came to the United States,,home of liberal arts education,,to talk with some of us,most closely identified,with that kind of education.,They spoke with a passion, an urgency,,an intellectual conviction,that, for me, was a voice I had not heard in decades,,a dream long forgotten.,For, in truth, we had moved light years,from the passions that animated them.,But for me, unlike them,,in my world, the slate was not clean,,and what was written on it was not encouraging. 
 In truth, liberal arts education,no longer exists --,at least genuine liberal arts education -- in this country.,We have professionalized liberal arts to the point,where they no longer provide the breadth of application,and the enhanced capacity for civic engagement,that is their signature.,Over the past century,the expert has dethroned the educated generalist,to become the sole model,of intellectual accomplishment. (Applause) 
 Expertise has for sure had its moments.,But the price of its dominance is enormous.,Subject matters are broken up,into smaller and smaller pieces,,with increasing emphasis on the technical and the obscure.,We have even managed to make the study of literature arcane.,You may think you know what is going on,in that Jane Austen novel --,that is, until your first encounter,with postmodern deconstructionism. 
 The progression of today's college student,is to jettison every interest except one.,And within that one, to continually narrow the focus,,learning more and more about less and less;,this, despite the evidence all around us,of the interconnectedness of things.,Lest you think I exaggerate,,here are the beginnings of the A-B-Cs of anthropology.,As one moves up the ladder,,values other than technical competence,are viewed with increasing suspicion.,Questions such as,,"What kind of a world are we making?,What kind of a world should we be making?,What kind of a world can we be making?",are treated with more and more skepticism,,and move off the table. 
 In so doing, the guardians of secular democracy,in effect yield the connection,between education and values,to fundamentalists,,who, you can be sure,,have no compunctions about using education,to further their values:,the absolutes of a theocracy.,Meanwhile, the values and voices of democracy are silent.,Either we have lost touch with those values,or, no better,,believe they need not,or cannot be taught.,This aversion to social values,may seem at odds with the explosion,of community service programs.,But despite the attention paid to these efforts,,they remain emphatically extracurricular.,In effect, civic-mindedness is treated,as outside the realm of what purports to be,serious thinking and adult purposes.,Simply put, when the impulse is to change the world,,the academy is more likely to engender,a learned helplessness,than to create a sense of empowerment. 
 This brew -- oversimplification of civic engagement,,idealization of the expert,,fragmentation of knowledge,,emphasis on technical mastery,,neutrality as a condition of academic integrity --,is toxic when it comes to pursuing the vital connections,between education and the public good,,between intellectual integrity,and human freedom,,which were at the heart --,(Applause) -- of the challenge posed to and by,my European colleagues.,When the astronomical distance,between the realities of the academy,and the visionary intensity of this challenge,were more than enough, I can assure you,,to give one pause,,what was happening outside higher education,made backing off unthinkable. 
 Whether it was threats to the environment,,inequities in the distribution of wealth,,lack of a sane policy or a sustainable policy,with respect to the continuing uses of energy,,we were in desperate straits.,And that was only the beginning.,The corrupting of our political life,had become a living nightmare;,nothing was exempt --,separation of powers, civil liberties,,the rule of law,,the relationship of church and state.,Accompanied by a squandering,of the nation's material wealth,that defied credulity.,A harrowing predilection for the uses of force,had become commonplace,,with an equal distaste,for the alternative forms of influence.,At the same time, all of our firepower was impotent,when it came to halting or even stemming,the slaughter in Rwanda, Darfur, Myanmar. 
 Our public education, once a model for the world,,has become most noteworthy,for its failures.,Mastery of basic skills and a bare minimum of cultural literacy,eludes vast numbers of our students.,Despite having a research establishment,that is the envy of the world,,more than half of the American public,don't believe in evolution.,And don't press your luck,about how much those who do believe in it,actually understand it. 
 Incredibly, this nation,,with all its material, intellectual and spiritual resources,,seems utterly helpless,to reverse the freefall in any of these areas.,Equally startling, from my point of view,,is the fact that no one,was drawing any connections,between what is happening to the body politic,,and what is happening in our leading educational institutions.,We may be at the top of the list,when it comes to influencing access to personal wealth.,We are not even on the list,when it comes to our responsibility,for the health of this democracy.,We are playing with fire.,You can be sure Jefferson knew,what he was talking about when he said,,"If a nation expects to be ignorant and free,in a state of civilization,,it expects what never was,,and never will be.",(Applause) 
 On a more personal note,,this betrayal of our principles,,our decency, our hope,,made it impossible for me,to avoid the question,,"What will I say, years from now,,when people ask, 'Where were you?'",As president of a leading liberal arts college,,famous for its innovative history,,there were no excuses.,So the conversation began at Bennington.,Knowing that if we were to regain,the integrity of liberal education,,it would take radical rethinking,of basic assumptions,,beginning with our priorities.,Enhancing the public good becomes a primary objective.,The accomplishment of civic virtue,is tied to the uses of intellect and imagination,at their most challenging. 
 Our ways of approaching agency and authority,turn inside out to reflect the reality,that no one has the answers,to the challenges facing citizens in this century,,and everyone has the responsibility,for trying and participating in finding them.,Bennington would continue to teach the arts and sciences,as areas of immersion that acknowledge differences,in personal and professional objectives.,But the balances redressed,,our shared purposes assume an equal,if not greater importance. 
 When the design emerged it was surprisingly simple and straightforward.,The idea is to make the political-social challenges themselves --,from health and education,to the uses of force --,the organizers of the curriculum.,They would assume the commanding role of traditional disciplines.,But structures designed to connect, rather than divide,mutually dependent circles,,rather than isolating triangles.,And the point is not to treat these topics,as topics of study,,but as frameworks of action.,The challenge: to figure out what it will take,to actually do something,that makes a significant and sustainable difference. 
 Contrary to widely held assumptions,,an emphasis on action provides a special urgency to thinking.,The importance of coming to grips with values like justice,,equity, truth,,becomes increasingly evident,as students discover that interest alone,cannot tell them what they need to know,when the issue is rethinking education,,our approach to health,,or strategies for achieving,an economics of equity.,The value of the past also comes alive;,it provides a lot of company.,You are not the first to try to figure this out,,just as you are unlikely to be the last.,Even more valuable,,history provides a laboratory,in which we see played out,the actual, as well as the intended,consequences of ideas. 
 In the language of my students,,"Deep thought matters,when you're contemplating what to do,about things that matter.",A new liberal arts that can support this,action-oriented curriculum,has begun to emerge.,Rhetoric, the art of organizing the world of words,to maximum effect.,Design, the art of organizing the world of things.,Mediation and improvisation,also assume a special place in this new pantheon.,Quantitative reasoning attains its proper position,at the heart of what it takes to manage change,where measurement is crucial.,As is a capacity to discriminate,systematically between what is at the core,and what is at the periphery. 
 And when making connections is of the essence,,the power of technology emerges with special intensity.,But so does the importance of content.,The more powerful our reach,,the more important the question "About what?",When improvisation, resourcefulness, imagination are key,,artists, at long last,,take their place at the table,,when strategies of action are in the process of being designed.,In this dramatically expanded ideal,of a liberal arts education,where the continuum of thought and action is its life's blood,,knowledge honed outside the academy,becomes essential.,Social activists, business leaders,,lawyers, politicians, professionals,will join the faculty as active and ongoing participants,in this wedding of liberal education to the advancement of the public good.,Students, in turn, continuously move outside the classroom,to engage the world directly. 
 And of course, this new wine,needs new bottles,if we are to capture the liveliness and dynamism,of this idea.,The most important discovery we made,in our focus on public action,was to appreciate that the hard choices,are not between good and evil,,but between competing goods.,This discovery is transforming.,It undercuts self-righteousness,,radically alters the tone and character of controversy,,and enriches dramatically,the possibilities for finding common ground.,Ideology, zealotry,,unsubstantiated opinions simply won't do.,This is a political education, to be sure.,But it is a politics of principle,,not of partisanship.,So the challenge for Bennington is to do it. 
 On the cover of Bennington's 2008 holiday card,is the architect's sketch of a building,opening in 2010,that is to be a center for the advancement,of public action.,The center will embody and sustain this new educational commitment.,Think of it as a kind of secular church.,The words on the card describe what will happen inside.,We intend to turn the intellectual,and imaginative power, passion and boldness,of our students, faculty and staff,to developing strategies,for acting on the critical challenges of our time. 
 So we are doing our job.,While these past weeks have been a time,of national exhilaration in this country,,it would be tragic if you thought this meant,your job was done.,The glacial silence we have experienced,in the face of the shredding of the constitution,,the unraveling of our public institutions,,the deterioration of our infrastructure,is not limited to the universities.,We the people,have become inured to our own irrelevance,when it comes to doing anything significant,about anything that matters,concerning governance,,beyond waiting another four years.,We persist also,in being sidelined by the idea of the expert,as the only one capable of coming up with answers,,despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary. 
 The problem is there is no such thing,as a viable democracy made up of experts,,zealots, politicians and spectators.,(Applause),People will continue and should continue,to learn everything there is to know about something or other.,We actually do it all the time.,And there will be and should be,those who spend a lifetime,pursuing a very highly defined area of inquiry.,But this single-mindedness will not yield,the flexibilities of mind,,the multiplicity of perspectives,,the capacities for collaboration and innovation,this country needs.,That is where you come in.,What is certain is that the individual talent,exhibited in such abundance here,,needs to turn its attention,to that collaborative, messy, frustrating,,contentious and impossible world,of politics and public policy.,President Obama and his team,simply cannot do it alone. 
 If the question of where to start seems overwhelming,you are at the beginning, not the end of this adventure.,Being overwhelmed is the first step,if you are serious about trying to get at things that really matter,,on a scale that makes a difference.,So what do you do when you feel overwhelmed?,Well, you have two things.,You have a mind. And you have other people.,Start with those, and change the world. 
 (Applause)I want to talk about the election.,For the first time in the United States, a predominantly white group of voters,voted for an African-American candidate for President.,And in fact Barack Obama did quite well.,He won 375 electoral votes.,And he won about 70 million popular votes,more than any other presidential candidate --,of any race, of any party -- in history.,If you compare how Obama did against how John Kerry had done four years earlier --,Democrats really like seeing this transition here,,where almost every state becomes bluer, becomes more democratic --,even states Obama lost, like out west,,those states became more blue.,In the south, in the northeast, almost everywhere,but with a couple of exceptions here and there. 
 One exception is in Massachusetts.,That was John Kerry's home state.,No big surprise, Obama couldn't do better than Kerry there.,Or in Arizona, which is John McCain's home,,Obama didn't have much improvement.,But there is also this part of the country, kind of in the middle region here.,This kind of Arkansas, Tennessee, Oklahoma, West Virginia region.,Now if you look at '96, Bill Clinton --,the last Democrat to actually win -- how he did in '96,,you see real big differences in this part of the country right here,,the kind of Appalachians, Ozarks, highlands region, as I call it:,20 or 30 point swings,from how Bill Clinton did in '96 to how Obama did,in 2008.,Yes Bill Clinton was from Arkansas, but these are very, very profound differences. 
 So, when we think about parts of the country like Arkansas, you know.,There is a book written called, "What's the Matter with Kansas?",But really the question here -- Obama did relatively well in Kansas.,He lost badly but every Democrat does.,He lost no worse than most people do.,But yeah, what's the matter with Arkansas?,(Laughter),And when we think of Arkansas we tend to have pretty negative connotations.,We think of a bunch of rednecks, quote, unquote, with guns.,And we think people like this probably don't want to vote,for people who look like this and are named Barack Obama.,We think it's a matter of race. And is this fair?,Are we kind of stigmatizing people from Arkansas, and this part of the country? 
 And the answer is: it is at least partially fair.,We know that race was a factor, and the reason why we know that,is because we asked those people.,Actually we didn't ask them, but when they conducted,exit polls in every state,,in 37 states, out of the 50,,they asked a question, that was pretty direct, about race.,They asked this question.,In deciding your vote for President today, was the race,of the candidate a factor?,We're looking for people that said, "Yes, race was a factor;,moreover it was an important factor, in my decision,",and people who voted for John McCain,as a result of that factor,,maybe in combination with other factors, and maybe alone.,We're looking for this behavior among white voters,or, really, non-black voters. 
 So you see big differences in different parts,of the country on this question.,In Louisiana, about one in five white voters,said, "Yes, one of the big reasons why I voted against Barack Obama,is because he was an African-American.",If those people had voted for Obama,,even half of them, Obama would have won Louisiana safely.,Same is true with, I think, all of these states you see on the top of the list.,Meanwhile, California, New York, we can say, "Oh we're enlightened",but you know, certainly a much lower incidence of this,admitted, I suppose,,manifestation of racially-based voting.,Here is the same data on a map.,You kind of see the relationship between,the redder states of where more people responded and said,,"Yes, Barack Obama's race was a problem for me.",You see, comparing the map to '96, you see an overlap here.,This really seems to explain,why Barack Obama did worse,in this one part of the country. 
 So we have to ask why.,Is racism predictable in some way?,Is there something driving this?,Is it just about some weird stuff that goes on in Arkansas,that we don't understand, and Kentucky?,Or are there more systematic factors at work?,And so we can look at a bunch of different variables.,These are things that economists and political scientists look at all the time --,things like income, and religion, education.,Which of these seem to drive,this manifestation of racism,in this big national experiment we had on November 4th?,And there are a couple of these that have,strong predictive relationships,,one of which is education,,where you see the states with the fewest years of schooling,per adult are in red,,and you see this part of the country, the kind of Appalachians region,,is less educated. It's just a fact.,And you see the relationship there,with the racially-based voting patterns.,The other variable that's important is,the type of neighborhood that you live in.,States that are more rural --,even to some extent of the states like New Hampshire and Maine --,they exhibit a little bit of,this racially-based voting against Barack Obama.,So it's the combination of these two things: it's education,and the type of neighbors that you have,,which we'll talk about more in a moment.,And the thing about states like Arkansas and Tennessee,is that they're both very rural,,and they are educationally impoverished. 
 So yes, racism is predictable.,These things, among maybe other variables,,but these things seem to predict it.,We're going to drill down a little bit more now,,into something called the General Social Survey.,This is conducted by the University of Chicago,every other year.,And they ask a series of really interesting questions.,In 2000 they had particularly interesting questions,about racial attitudes.,One simple question they asked is,,"Does anyone of the opposite race live in your neighborhood?",We can see in different types of communities that the results are quite different.,In cites, about 80 percent of people,have someone whom they consider a neighbor of another race,,but in rural communities, only about 30 percent.,Probably because if you live on a farm, you might not have a lot of neighbors, period.,But nevertheless, you're not having a lot of interaction with people,who are unlike you.,So what we're going to do now is take the white people in the survey,and split them between those who have black neighbors --,or, really, some neighbor of another race --,and people who have only white neighbors.,And we see in some variables,in terms of political attitudes, not a lot of difference.,This was eight years ago, some people were more Republican back then.,But you see Democrats versus Republican,,not a big difference based on who your neighbors are. 
 And even some questions about race -- for example,affirmative action, which is kind of a political question,,a policy question about race, if you will --,not much difference here.,Affirmative action is not very popular frankly, with white voters, period.,But people with black neighbors and people with mono-racial neighborhoods,feel no differently about it really.,But if you probe a bit deeper and get a bit more personal if you will,,"Do you favor a law banning interracial marriage?",There is a big difference.,People who don't have neighbors of a different race,are about twice as likely,to oppose interracial marriage as people who do.,Just based on who lives in your immediate neighborhood around you.,And likewise they asked, not in 2000, but in the same survey in 1996,,"Would you not vote for a qualified black president?",You see people without neighbors who are African-American who,were much more likely to say, "That would give me a problem." 
 So it's really not even about urban versus rural.,It's about who you live with.,Racism is predictable. And it's predicted by,interaction or lack thereof with people unlike you, people of other races.,So if you want to address it,,the goal is to facilitate interaction with people of other races.,I have a couple of very obvious, I suppose,,ideas for maybe how to do that. 
 I'm a big fan of cities.,Especially if we have cites that are diverse and sustainable,,and can support people of different ethnicities and different income groups.,I think cities facilitate more of the kind of networking,,the kind of casual interaction than you might have on a daily basis.,But also not everyone wants to live in a city, certainly not a city like New York.,So we can think more about things like street grids.,This is the neighborhood where I grew up in East Lansing, Michigan.,It's a traditional Midwestern community, which means you have real grid.,You have real neighborhoods and real trees, and real streets you can walk on.,And you interact a lot with your neighbors --,people you like, people you might not know.,And as a result it's a very tolerant community,,which is different, I think, than something like this,,which is in Schaumburg, Illinois,,where every little set of houses has their own cul-de-sac,and drive-through Starbucks and stuff like that.,I think that actually this type of urban design,,which became more prevalent in the 1970s and 1980s --,I think there is a relationship between that and the country becoming,more conservative under Ronald Reagan. 
 But also here is another idea we have --,is an intercollegiate exchange program,where you have students going from New York abroad.,But frankly there are enough differences within the country now,where maybe you can take a bunch of kids from NYU,,have them go study for a semester at the University of Arkansas,,and vice versa. Do it at the high school level.,Literally there are people who might be in school in Arkansas or Tennessee,and might never interact in a positive affirmative way,with someone from another part of the country, or of another racial group.,I think part of the education variable we talked about before,is the networking experience you get when you go to college,where you do get a mix of people that you might not interact with otherwise. 
 But the point is, this is all good news,,because when something is predictable,,it is what I call designable.,You can start thinking about solutions to solving that problem,,even if the problem is pernicious and as intractable as racism.,If we understand the root causes of the behavior,and where it manifests itself and where it doesn't,,we can start to design solutions to it.,So that's all I have to say. Thank you very much.,(Applause)Information technology grows in an exponential manner.,It's not linear. And our intuition is linear.,When we walked through the savanna a thousand years ago,we made linear predictions where that animal would be,,and that worked fine. It's hardwired in our brains.,But the pace of exponential growth,is really what describes information technologies.,And it's not just computation.,There is a big difference between linear and exponential growth.,If I take 30 steps linearly -- one, two, three, four, five --,I get to 30.,If I take 30 steps exponentially -- two, four, eight, 16 --,I get to a billion.,It makes a huge difference.,And that really describes information technology. 
 When I was a student at MIT,,we all shared one computer that took up a whole building.,The computer in your cellphone today is a million times cheaper,,a million times smaller,,a thousand times more powerful.,That's a billion-fold increase in capability per dollar,that we've actually experienced since I was a student.,And we're going to do it again in the next 25 years.,Information technology progresses,through a series of S-curves,where each one is a different paradigm.,So people say, "What's going to happen when Moore's Law comes to an end?",Which will happen around 2020.,We'll then go to the next paradigm.,And Moore's Law was not the first paradigm,to bring exponential growth to computing.,The exponential growth of computing started,decades before Gordon Moore was even born.,And it doesn't just apply to computation.,It's really any technology where we can measure,the underlying information properties. 
 Here we have 49 famous computers. I put them in a logarithmic graph.,The logarithmic scale hides the scale of the increase,,because this represents trillions-fold increase,since the 1890 census.,In 1950s they were shrinking vacuum tubes,,making them smaller and smaller. They finally hit a wall;,they couldn't shrink the vacuum tube any more and keep the vacuum.,And that was the end of the shrinking of vacuum tubes,,but it was not the end of the exponential growth of computing.,We went to the fourth paradigm, transistors,,and finally integrated circuits.,When that comes to an end we'll go to the sixth paradigm;,three-dimensional self-organizing molecular circuits. 
 But what's even more amazing, really, than this,fantastic scale of progress,,is that -- look at how predictable this is.,I mean this went through thick and thin,,through war and peace, through boom times and recessions.,The Great Depression made not a dent in this exponential progression.,We'll see the same thing in the economic recession we're having now.,At least the exponential growth of information technology capability,will continue unabated. 
 And I just updated these graphs.,Because I had them through 2002 in my book, "The Singularity is Near.",So we updated them,,so I could present it here, to 2007.,And I was asked, "Well aren't you nervous?,Maybe it kind of didn't stay on this exponential progression.",I was a little nervous,because maybe the data wouldn't be right,,but I've done this now for 30 years,,and it has stayed on this exponential progression. 
 Look at this graph here.You could buy one transistor for a dollar in 1968.,You can buy half a billion today,,and they are actually better, because they are faster.,But look at how predictable this is.,And I'd say this knowledge is over-fitting to past data.,I've been making these forward-looking predictions for about 30 years.,And the cost of a transistor cycle,,which is a measure of the price performance of electronics,,comes down about every year.,That's a 50 percent deflation rate.,And it's also true of other examples,,like DNA data or brain data.,But we more than make up for that.,We actually ship more than twice as much,of every form of information technology.,We've had 18 percent growth in constant dollars,in every form of information technology for the last half-century,,despite the fact that you can get twice as much of it each year. 
 This is a completely different example.,This is not Moore's Law.,The amount of DNA data,we've sequenced has doubled every year.,The cost has come down by half every year.,And this has been a smooth progression,since the beginning of the genome project.,And halfway through the project, skeptics said,,"Well, this is not working out. You're halfway through the genome project,and you've finished one percent of the project.",But that was really right on schedule.,Because if you double one percent seven more times,,which is exactly what happened,,you get 100 percent. And the project was finished on time. 
 Communication technologies:,50 different ways to measure this,,the number of bits being moved around, the size of the Internet.,But this has progressed at an exponential pace.,This is deeply democratizing.,I wrote, over 20 years ago in "The Age of Intelligent Machines,",when the Soviet Union was going strong, that it would be swept away,by this growth of decentralized communication. 
 And we will have plenty of computation as we go through the 21st century,to do things like simulate regions of the human brain.,But where will we get the software?,Some critics say, "Oh, well software is stuck in the mud.",But we are learning more and more about the human brain.,Spatial resolution of brain scanning is doubling every year.,The amount of data we're getting about the brain is doubling every year.,And we're showing that we can actually turn this data,into working models and simulations of brain regions. 
 There is about 20 regions of the brain that have been modeled,,simulated and tested:,the auditory cortex, regions of the visual cortex;,cerebellum, where we do our skill formation;,slices of the cerebral cortex, where we do our rational thinking.,And all of this has fueled,an increase, very smooth and predictable, of productivity.,We've gone from 30 dollars to 130 dollars,in constant dollars in the value of an average hour of human labor,,fueled by this information technology. 
 And we're all concerned about energy and the environment.,Well this is a logarithmic graph.,This represents a smooth doubling,,every two years, of the amount of solar energy we're creating,,particularly as we're now applying nanotechnology,,a form of information technology, to solar panels.,And we're only eight doublings away,from it meeting 100 percent of our energy needs.,And there is 10 thousand times more sunlight than we need. 
 We ultimately will merge with this technology. It's already very close to us.,When I was a student it was across campus, now it's in our pockets.,What used to take up a building now fits in our pockets.,What now fits in our pockets would fit in a blood cell in 25 years.,And we will begin to actually deeply influence,our health and our intelligence,,as we get closer and closer to this technology. 
 Based on that we are announcing, here at TED,,in true TED tradition, Singularity University.,It's a new university,that's founded by Peter Diamandis, who is here in the audience,,and myself.,It's backed by NASA and Google,,and other leaders in the high-tech and science community.,And our goal was to assemble the leaders,,both teachers and students,,in these exponentially growing information technologies,,and their application.,But Larry Page made an impassioned speech,at our organizing meeting,,saying we should devote this study,to actually addressing some of the major challenges facing humanity.,And if we did that, then Google would back this.,And so that's what we've done. 
 The last third of the nine-week intensive summer session,will be devoted to a group project to address,some major challenge of humanity.,Like for example, applying the Internet,,which is now ubiquitous, in the rural areas of China or in Africa,,to bringing health information,to developing areas of the world.,And these projects will continue past these sessions,,using collaborative interactive communication.,All the intellectual property that is created and taught,will be online and available,,and developed online in a collaborative fashion. 
 Here is our founding meeting.,But this is being announced today.,It will be permanently headquartered in Silicon Valley,,at the NASA Ames research center.,There are different programs for graduate students,,for executives at different companies.,The first six tracks here -- artificial intelligence,,advanced computing technologies, biotechnology, nanotechnology --,are the different core areas of information technology.,Then we are going to apply them to the other areas,,like energy, ecology,,policy law and ethics, entrepreneurship,,so that people can bring these new technologies to the world. 
 So we're very appreciative of the support we've gotten,from both the intellectual leaders, the high-tech leaders,,particularly Google and NASA.,This is an exciting new venture.,And we invite you to participate. Thank you very much.,(Applause)The brilliant playwright, Adrienne Kennedy,,wrote a volume called,"People Who Led to My Plays.",And if I were to write a volume,,it would be called,,"Artists Who Have Led My Exhibitions",because my work,,in understanding art and in understanding culture,,has come by following artists,,by looking at what artists mean,and what they do and who they are.,J.J. from "Good Times,",(Applause),significant to many people of course,because of "Dy-no-mite,",but perhaps more significant,as the first, really, black artist,on primetime TV.,Jean-Michel Basquiat,,important to me because [he was],the first black artist in real time,that showed me the possibility of,who and what I was about to enter into. 
 My overall project is about art --,specifically, about black artists --,very generally,about the way in which art,can change the way we think,about culture and ourselves.,My interest is in artists,who understand and rewrite history,,who think about themselves,within the narrative,of the larger world of art,,but who have created new places,for us to see and understand.,I'm showing two artists here, nGlenn Ligon and Kara Walker,,two of many who really form for me,the essential questions that I wanted to bring,as a curator to the world.,I was interested in the idea,of why and how,I could create a new story,,a new narrative in art history,and a new narrative in the world.,And to do this, I knew,that I had to see the way in which artists work,,understand the artist's studio,as a laboratory,,imagine, then,,reinventing the museum as a think tank,and looking at the exhibition,as the ultimate white paper -- asking questions,,providing the space,to look and to think about answers. 
 In 1994,,when I was a curator at the Whitney Museum,,I made an exhibition called Black Male.,It looked at the intersection,of race and gender,in contemporary American art.,It sought to express,the ways in which art,could provide a space for dialogue --,complicated dialogue,,dialogue with many, many points of entry --,and how the museum could be the space,for this contest of ideas.,This exhibition included,over 20 artists,of various ages and races,,but all looking at black masculinity,from a very particular point of view.,What was significant about this exhibition,is the way in which,it engaged me in my role,as a curator, as a catalyst,,for this dialogue.,One of the things that happened,very distinctly in the course of this exhibition,is I was confronted with the idea,of how powerful images can be,in people's understanding nof themselves and each other. 
 I'm showing you two works, one on the right by Leon Golub,,one on the left by Robert Colescott.,And in the course of the exhibition --,which was contentious, controversial,and ultimately, for me,,life-changing,in my sense of what art could be --,a woman came up to me on the gallery floor,to express her concern about the nature,of how powerful images could be,and how we understood each other.,And she pointed to the work on the left,to tell me how problematic this image was,,as it related, for her, to the idea of,how black people had been represented.,And she pointed to the image on the right,as an example, to me, of the kind of dignity,that needed to be portrayed,to work against those images in the media.,She then assigned these works racial identities,,basically saying to me that the work on the right,,clearly, was made by a black artist,,the work on the left, clearly, by a white artist,,when, in effect,,that was the opposite case:,Bob Colescott, African-American artist;,Leon Golub, a white artist.,The point of that for me was,to say -- in that space, in that moment --,that I really, more than anything,,wanted to understand,how images could work, how images did work,,and how artists provided,a space bigger than one,that we could imagine in our day-to-day lives,to work through these images. 
 Fast-forward and I end up in Harlem;,home for many of black America,,very much the psychic heart,of the black experience,,really the place where the Harlem Renaissance existed.,Harlem now, sort of explaining,and thinking of itself in this part of the century,,looking both backwards and forwards ...,I always say Harlem is an interesting community,because, unlike many other places,,it thinks of itself in the past, present,and the future simultaneously;,no one speaks of it just in the now.,It's always what it was and what it can be.,And, in thinking about that,,then my second project, the second question I ask is:,Can a museum,be a catalyst in a community?,Can a museum house artists,and allow them to be change agents,as communities rethink themselves?,This is Harlem, actually, on January 20th,,thinking about itself in a very wonderful way. 
 So I work now at The Studio Museum in Harlem,,thinking about exhibitions there,,thinking about what it means to,discover art's possibility.,Now, what does this mean to some of you?,In some cases, I know that many of you,are involved in cross-cultural dialogues,,you're involved in ideas of creativity and innovation.,Think about the place that artists can play in that --,that is the kind of incubation and advocacy,that I work towards, in working with young, black artists.,Think about artists, not as content providers,,though they can be brilliant at that,,but, again, as real catalysts. 
 The Studio Museum was founded in the late 60s.,And I bring this up because it's important to locate,this practice in history.,To look at 1968,,in the incredible historic moment that it is,,and think of the arc that has happened since then,,to think of the possibilities that we are all,privileged to stand in today,and imagine that this museum,that came out of a moment of great protest,and one that was so much about,examining the history and the legacy,of important African-American artists,to the history of art in this country,like Jacob Lawrence, Norman Lewis,,Romare Bearden. 
 And then, of course,,to bring us to today.,In 1975, Muhammad Ali,gave a lecture at Harvard University.,After his lecture, a student got up and said to him,,"Give us a poem.",And Mohammed Ali said, "Me, we.",A profound statement about the individual and the community.,The space in which now,,in my project of discovery, of thinking about artists,,of trying to define,what might be,black art cultural movement of the 21st century.,What that might mean,for cultural movements all over this moment,,the "me, we" seems,incredibly prescient,totally important. 
 To this end,,the specific project that has made this possible for me,is a series of exhibitions,,all titled with an F --,Freestyle, Frequency and Flow --,which have set out to discover,and define,the young, black artists working in this moment,who I feel strongly,will continue to work over the next many years.,This series of exhibitions,was made specifically,to try and question,the idea of what it would mean,now, at this point in history,,to see art as a catalyst;,what it means now, at this point in history,,as we define and redefine culture,,black culture specifically in my case,,but culture generally.,I named this group of artists,around an idea, which I put out there,called post-black,,really meant to define them,as artists who came and start their work now,,looking back at history but start in this moment, historically. 
 It is really in this sense of discovery,that I have a new set of questions that I'm asking.,This new set of questions is:,What does it mean, right now,,to be African-American in America?,What can artwork say about this?,Where can a museum exist,as the place for us all,to have this conversation?,Really, most exciting about this,is thinking about the energy and the excitement,that young artists can bring.,Their works for me are about,,not always just simply,about the aesthetic innovation,that their minds imagine, that their visions create,and put out there in the world,,but more, perhaps, importantly,,through the excitement of the community,that they create as important voices,that would allow us right now to understand our situation,,as well as in the future.,I am continually amazed,by the way in which,the subject of race,can take itself in many places,that we don't imagine it should be.,I am always amazed,by the way in which artists are willing,to do that in their work.,It is why I look to art.,It's why I ask questions of art.,It is why I make exhibitions. 
 Now, this exhibition, as I said,,40 young artists done over the course of eight years,,and for me it's about considering the implications.,It's considering the implications of,what this generation has to say to the rest of us.,It's considering what it means for these artists,to be both out in the world as their work travels,,but in their communities,as people who are seeing and thinking,about the issues that face us.,It's also about thinking about,the creative spirit and nurturing it,,and imagining, particularly in urban America,,about the nurturing of the spirit. 
 Now, where, perhaps, does this end up right now?,For me, it is about re-imagining,this cultural discourse in an international context.,So the last iteration of this project,has been called Flow,,with the idea now of creating,a real network,of artists around the world;,really looking, not so much,from Harlem and out, but looking across,,and Flow looked at artists all born on the continent of Africa.,And as many of us think about that continent,and think about what if means,to us all in the 21st century,,I have begun that looking,through artists, through artworks,,and imagining what they can tell us about the future,,what they tell us about our future,,and what they create in their sense of,offering us this great possibility of watching,that continent emerge as part,of our bigger dialogue.,So, what do I discover 
 when I look at artworks?,What do I think about,when I think about art?,I feel like the privilege I've had as a curator,is not just the discovery of new works,,the discovery of exciting works.,But, really, it has been,what I've discovered about myself,and what I can offer,in the space of an exhibition,,to talk about beauty, to talk about power,,to talk about ourselves,,and to talk and speak to each other.,That's what makes me get up every day,and want to think about,this generation of black artists and artists around the world. 
 Thank you. (Applause)Hello! My name is Golan Levin.,I'm an artist and an engineer,,which is, increasingly, a more common kind of hybrid.,But I still fall into this weird crack,where people don't seem to understand me.,And I was looking around and I found this wonderful picture.,It's a letter from "Artforum" in 1967,saying "We can't imagine ever doing a special issue,on electronics or computers in art." And they still haven't.,And lest you think that you all, as the digerati, are more enlightened,,I went to the Apple iPhone app store the other day.,Where's art? I got productivity. I got sports.,And somehow the idea that one would want to make art for the iPhone,,which my friends and I are doing now,,is still not reflected in our understanding,of what computers are for. 
 So, from both directions, there is kind of, I think, a lack of understanding,about what it could mean to be an artist who uses the materials,of his own day, or her own day,,which I think artists are obliged to do,,is to really explore the expressive potential of the new tools that we have.,In my own case, I'm an artist,,and I'm really interested in,expanding the vocabulary of human action,,and basically empowering people through interactivity.,I want people to discover themselves as actors,,as creative actors, by having interactive experiences. 
 A lot of my work is about trying to get away from this.,This a photograph of the desktop of a student of mine.,And when I say desktop, I don't just mean,the actual desk where his mouse has worn away the surface of the desk.,If you look carefully, you can even see,a hint of the Apple menu, up here in the upper left,,where the virtual world has literally,punched through to the physical.,So this is, as Joy Mountford once said,,"The mouse is probably the narrowest straw,you could try to suck all of human expression through." 
 (Laughter) 
 And the thing I'm really trying to do is enabling people to have more rich,kinds of interactive experiences.,How can we get away from the mouse and use our full bodies,as a way of exploring aesthetic experiences,,not necessarily utilitarian ones.,So I write software. And that's how I do it.,And a lot of my experiences,resemble mirrors in some way.,Because this is, in some sense, the first way,,that people discover their own potential as actors,,and discover their own agency.,By saying "Who is that person in the mirror? Oh it's actually me." 
 And so, to give an example,,this is a project from last year,,which is called the Interstitial Fragment Processor.,And it allows people to explore the negative shapes that they create,when they're just going about their everyday business.,So as people make shapes with their hands or their heads,and so forth, or with each other,,these shapes literally produce sounds and drop out of thin air --,basically taking what's often this, kind of, unseen space,,or this undetected space, and making it something real,,that people then can appreciate and become creative with.,So again, people discover their creative agency in this way.,And their own personalities come out,in totally unique ways. 
 So in addition to using full-body input,,something that I've explored now, for a while,,has been the use of the voice,,which is an immensely expressive system for us, vocalizing.,Song is one of our oldest ways,of making ourselves heard and understood.,And I came across this fantastic research by Wolfgang Köhler,,the so-called father of gestalt psychology, from 1927,,who submitted to an audience like yourselves,the following two shapes.,And he said one of them is called Maluma.,And one of them is called Taketa. Which is which?,Anyone want to hazard a guess?,Maluma is on top. Yeah. So.,As he says here, most people answer without any hesitation. 
 So what we're really seeing here is a phenomenon,called phonaesthesia,,which is a kind of synesthesia that all of you have.,And so, whereas Dr. Oliver Sacks has talked about,how perhaps one person in a million,actually has true synesthesia,,where they hear colors or taste shapes, and things like this,,phonaesthesia is something we can all experience to some extent.,It's about mappings between different perceptual domains,,like hardness, sharpness, brightness and darkness,,and the phonemes that we're able to speak with. 
 So 70 years on, there's been some research where,cognitive psychologists have actually sussed out,the extent to which, you know,,L, M and B are more associated with shapes that look like this,,and P, T and K are perhaps more associated with shapes like this.,And here we suddenly begin to have a mapping between curvature,that we can exploit numerically,,a relative mapping between curvature and shape. 
 So it occurred to me, what happens if we could run these backwards?,And thus was born the project called Remark,,which is a collaboration with Zachary Lieberman,and the Ars Electronica Futurelab.,And this is an interactive installation which presents,the fiction that speech casts visible shadows.,So the idea is you step into a kind of a magic light.,And as you do, you see the shadows of your own speech.,And they sort of fly away, out of your head.,If a computer speech recognition system,is able to recognize what you're saying, then it spells it out.,And if it isn't then it produces a shape which is very phonaesthetically,tightly coupled to the sounds you made.,So let's bring up a video of that. 
 (Applause) 
 Thanks. So. And this project here,,I was working with the great abstract vocalist, Jaap Blonk.,And he is a world expert in performing "The Ursonate,",which is a half-an-hour nonsense poem,by Kurt Schwitters, written in the 1920s,,which is half an hour of very highly patterned nonsense.,And it's almost impossible to perform.,But Jaap is one of the world experts in performing it.,And in this project we've developed,a form of intelligent real-time subtitles.,So these are our live subtitles,,that are being produced by a computer that knows the text of "The Ursonate" --,fortunately Jaap does too, very well --,and it is delivering that text at the same time as Jaap is.,So all the text you're going to see,is real-time generated by the computer,,visualizing what he's doing with his voice.,Here you can see the set-up where there is a screen with the subtitles behind him.,Okay. So ...,(Applause),The full videos are online if you are interested. 
 I got a split reaction to that during the live performance,,because there is some people who understand,live subtitles are a kind of an oxymoron,,because usually there is someone making them afterwards.,And then a bunch of people who were like, "What's the big deal?,I see subtitles all the time on television.",You know? They don't imagine the person in the booth, typing it all. 
 So in addition to the full body, and in addition to the voice,,another thing that I've been really interested in,,most recently, is the use of the eyes,,or the gaze, in terms of how people relate to each other.,It's a really profound amount of nonverbal information,that's communicated with the eyes.,And it's one of the most interesting technical challenges,that's very currently active in the computer sciences:,being able to have a camera that can understand,,from a fairly big distance away,,how these little tiny balls are actually pointing in one way or another,to reveal what you're interested in,,and where your attention is directed.,So there is a lot of emotional communication that happens there. 
 And so I've been beginning, with a variety of different projects,,to understand how people can relate to machines with their eyes.,And basically to ask the questions:,What if art was aware that we were looking at it?,How could it respond, in a way,,to acknowledge or subvert the fact that we're looking at it?,And what could it do if it could look back at us?,And so those are the questions that are happening in the next projects. 
 In the first one which I'm going to show you, called Eyecode,,it's a piece of interactive software,in which, if we read this little circle,,"the trace left by the looking of the previous observer,looks at the trace left by the looking of previous observer.",The idea is that it's an image wholly constructed,from its own history of being viewed,by different people in an installation.,So let me just switch over so we can do the live demo.,So let's run this and see if it works. 
 Okay. Ah, there is lots of nice bright video.,There is just a little test screen that shows that it's working.,And what I'm just going to do is -- I'm going to hide that.,And you can see here that what it's doing,is it's recording my eyes every time I blink.,Hello? And I can ... hello ... okay.,And no matter where I am, what's really going on here,is that it's an eye-tracking system that tries to locate my eyes.,And if I get really far away I'm blurry.,You know, you're going to have these kind of blurry spots like this,that maybe only resemble eyes in a very very abstract way.,But if I come up really close and stare directly at the camera,on this laptop then you'll see these nice crisp eyes. 
 You can think of it as a way of, sort of, typing, with your eyes.,And what you're typing are recordings of your eyes,as you're looking at other peoples' eyes.,So each person is looking at the looking,of everyone else before them.,And this exists in larger installations,where there are thousands and thousands of eyes,that people could be staring at,,as you see who's looking at the people looking,at the people looking before them.,So I'll just add a couple more. Blink. Blink.,And you can see, just once again, how it's sort of finding my eyes,and doing its best to estimate when it's blinking.,Alright. Let's leave that.,So that's this kind of recursive observation system.,(Applause),Thank you. 
 The last couple pieces I'm going to show,are basically in the new realm of robotics -- for me, new for me.,It's called Opto-Isolator.,And I'm going to show a video of the older version of it,,which is just a minute long. Okay.,In this case, the Opto-Isolator is blinking,in response to one's own blinks.,So it blinks one second after you do.,This is a device which is intended to reduce,the phenomenon of gaze down to the simplest possible materials.,Just one eye,,looking at you, and eliminating everything else about a face,,but just to consider gaze in an isolated way,as a kind of, as an element.,And at the same time, it attempts to engage in what you might call,familiar psycho-social gaze behaviors.,Like looking away if you look at it too long,because it gets shy,,or things like that. 
 Okay. So the last project I'm going to show,is this new one called Snout.,(Laughter),It's an eight-foot snout,,with a googly eye.,(Laughter),And inside it's got an 800-pound robot arm,that I borrowed,,(Laughter),from a friend.,(Laughter),It helps to have good friends.,I'm at Carnegie Mellon; we've got a great Robotics Institute there.,I'd like to show you thing called Snout, which is --,The idea behind this project is to,make a robot that appears as if it's continually surprised to see you.,(Laughter),The idea is that basically --,if it's constantly like "Huh? ... Huh?",That's why its other name is Doubletaker, Taker of Doubles.,It's always kind of doing a double take: "What?",And the idea is basically, can it look at you,and make you feel as if like,,"What? Is it my shoes?","Got something on my hair?" Here we go. Alright. 
 Checking him out ...,For you nerds, here's a little behind-the-scenes.,It's got a computer vision system,,and it tries to look at the people who are moving around the most.,Those are its targets.,Up there is the skeleton,,which is actually what it's trying to do.,It's really about trying to create a novel body language for a new creature.,Hollywood does this all the time, of course.,But also have the body language communicate something,to the person who is looking at it.,This language is communicating that it is surprised to see you,,and it's interested in looking at you. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you very much. That's all I've got for today.,And I'm really happy to be here. Thank you so much. 
 (Applause)A few years ago, my eyes were opened,to the dark side of the construction industry.,In 2006, young Qatari students,took me to go and see the migrant worker camps.,And since then I've followed the unfolding issue of worker rights. 
 In the last six months, more than 300 skyscrapers,in the UAE have been put on hold or canceled.,Behind the headlines that lay behind these buildings,is the fate of the often-indentured construction worker.,1.1 million of them.,Mainly Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan,and Nepalese, these laborers risk everything,to make money for their families back home.,They pay a middle-man thousands of dollars to be there.,And when they arrive, they find themselves in labor camps with no water,,no air conditioning, and their passports taken away. 
 While it's easy to point the finger at local officials and higher authorities,,99 percent of these people are hired by the private sector,,and so therefore we're equally, if not more, accountable.,Groups like Buildsafe UAE have emerged,,but the numbers are simply overwhelming.,In August 2008,,UAE public officials noted,that 40 percent of the country's 1,098 labor camps,had violated minimum health and fire safety regulations.,And last summer, more than 10,000 workers,protested for the non-payment of wages,,for the poor quality of food, and inadequate housing. 
 And then the financial collapse happened.,When the contractors have gone bust,,as they've been overleveraged like everyone else,,the difference is everything goes missing,,documentation, passports,,and tickets home for these workers.,Currently, right now, thousands of workers are abandoned.,There is no way back home.,And there is no way, and no proof of arrival.,These are the boom-and-bust refugees. 
 The question is, as a building professional,,as an architect, an engineer, as a developer,,if you know this is going on,,as we go to the sights every single week,,are you complacent or complicit,in the human rights violations?,So let's forget your environmental footprint.,Let's think about your ethical footprint.,What good is it,to build a zero-carbon, energy efficient complex,,when the labor producing this architectural gem,is unethical at best?,Now, recently I've been told I've been taking the high road.,But, quite frankly, on this issue,,there is no other road. 
 So let's not forget who is really paying the price of this financial collapse.,And that as we worry about our next job in the office,,the next design that we can get, to keep our workers.,Let's not forget these men, who are truly dying to work.,Thank you.,(Applause)What we're really here to talk about is the "how.",Okay, so how exactly do we create this,world-shattering, if you will, innovation?,Now, I want to tell you a quick story.,We'll go back a little more than a year.,In fact, the date -- I'm curious to know,if any of you know what happened on this momentous date?,It was February 3rd, 2008.,Anyone remember what happened,,February 3rd, 2008?,Super Bowl. I heard it over here. It was the date of the Super Bowl. 
 And the reason that this date was so momentous,is that what my colleagues, John King,and Halee Fischer-Wright, and I noticed,as we began to debrief various Super Bowl parties,,is that it seemed to us,that across the United States,,if you will, tribal councils had convened.,And they had discussed things of great national importance.,Like, "Do we like the Budweiser commercial?",and, "Do we like the nachos?" and, "Who is going to win?",But they also talked about which candidate they were going to support. 
 And if you go back in time to February 3rd,,it looked like Hilary Clinton was going to get the Democratic nomination.,And there were even some polls that were saying she was going to go all the way.,But when we talked to people,,it appeared that a funnel effect had happened,in these tribes all across the United States.,Now what is a tribe? A tribe is a group of,about 20 -- so kind of more than a team --,20 to about 150 people.,And it's within these tribes that all of our work gets done.,But not just work. It's within these tribes,that societies get built,,that important things happen. 
 And so as we surveyed the, if you will, representatives,from various tribal councils that met,,also known as Super Bowl parties,,we sent the following email off to 40 newspaper editors the following day.,February 4th, we posted it on our website. This was before Super Tuesday.,We said, "The tribes that we're in,are saying it's going to be Obama.",Now, the reason we knew that,was because we spent the previous 10 years,studying tribes, studying these naturally occurring groups. 
 All of you are members of tribes.,In walking around at the break,,many of you had met members of your tribe. And you were talking to them.,And many of you were doing what great, if you will, tribal leaders do,,which is to find someone,who is a member of a tribe,,and to find someone else who is another member of a different tribe,,and make introductions.,That is in fact what great tribal leaders do. 
 So here is the bottom line.,If you focus in on a group like this --,this happens to be a USC game --,and you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras,and do magnification factors so you could see individual people,,you would in fact see not a single crowd,,just like there is not a single crowd here,,but you would see these tribes that are then coming together.,And from a distance it appears that it's a single group.,And so people form tribes.,They always have. They always will.,Just as fish swim and birds fly,,people form tribes. It's just what we do.,But here's the rub.,Not all tribes are the same,,and what makes the difference is the culture. 
 Now here is the net out of this.,You're all a member of tribes.,If you can find a way to take the tribes that you're in,and nudge them forward,,along these tribal stages,to what we call Stage Five, which is the top of the mountain.,But we're going to start with what we call Stage One.,Now, this is the lowest of the stages.,You don't want this. Okay?,This is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen.,But it's one that I think we need to learn from. 
 Stage One produces people,who do horrible things.,This is the kid who shot up Virginia Tech.,Stage One is a group where people,systematically sever relationships from functional tribes,,and then pool together,with people who think like they do.,Stage One is literally the culture of gangs,and it is the culture of prisons.,Now, again, we don't often deal with Stage One.,And I want to make the point,that as members of society, we need to.,It's not enough to simply write people off. 
 But let's move on to Stage Two.,Now, Stage One, you'll notice, says, in effect, "Life Sucks.",So, this other book that Steve mentioned,,that just came out, called "The Three Laws of Performance,",my colleague, Steve Zaffron and I,,argue that as people see the world, so they behave.,Well, if people see the world in such a way that life sucks,,then their behavior will follow automatically from that.,It will be despairing hostility.,They'll do whatever it takes to survive,,even if that means undermining other people. 
 Now, my birthday is coming up shortly,,and my driver's license expires.,And the reason that that's relevant is that very soon,I will be walking into what we call,a Stage Two tribe,,which looks like this.,(Laughter),Now, am I saying that in every Department of Motor Vehicles,across the land, you find a Stage Two culture?,No. But in the one near me,,where I have to go in just a few days,,what I will say when I'm standing in line is,,"How can people be so dumb, and yet live?",(Laughter) 
 Now, am I saying that there are dumb people working here?,Actually, no, I'm not.,But I'm saying the culture makes people dumb.,So in a Stage Two culture --,and we find these in all sorts of different places --,you find them, in fact, in the best organizations in the world.,You find them in all places in society.,I've come across them at the organizations,that everybody raves about as being best in class.,But here is the point. If you believe and you say,to people in your tribe, in effect,,"My life sucks.,I mean, if I got to go to TEDx USC,my life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does.",If that's how you talked, imagine what kind of work would get done.,What kind of innovation would get done?,The amount of world-changing behavior that would happen?,In fact it would be basically nil. 
 Now when we go on to Stage Three: this is the one,that hits closest to home for many of us.,Because it is in Stage Three that many of us move.,And we park. And we stay.,Stage Three says, "I'm great. And you're not.",(Laughter),I'm great and you're not.,Now imagine having a whole room of people,saying, in effect, "I'm great and you're not.",Or, "I'm going to find some way to compete with you,and come out on top as a result of that.",A whole group of people communicating that way, talking that way. 
 I know this sounds like a joke. Three doctors walk into a bar.,But, in this case, three doctors walk into an elevator.,I happened to be in the elevator collecting data for this book.,And one doctor said to the others, "Did you see my article,in the New England Journal of Medicine?",And the other said, "No. That's great. Congratulations!" 
 The next one got kind of a wry smile on his face and said,,"Well while you were, you know, doing your research," --,notice the condescending tone --,"While you were off doing your research, I was off doing more surgeries,than anyone else in the department of surgery at this institution." 
 And the third one got the same wry smile and said,,"Well, while you were off doing your research,,and you were off doing your monkey meatball surgery,,that eventually we'll train monkeys to do,,or cells or robots, or maybe not even need to do it at all,,I was off running the future of the residency program,,which is really the future of medicine." 
 And they all kind of laughed and they patted him on the back.,And the elevator door opened, and they all walked out.,That is a meeting of a Stage Three tribe.,Now, we find these in places,where really smart, successful people show up.,Like, oh, I don't know, TEDx USC.,(Laughter) 
 Here is the greatest challenge we face in innovation.,It is moving from Stage Three,to Stage Four.,Let's take a look at a quick video snippet.,This is from a company called Zappos, located outside Las Vegas.,And my question on the other side is just going to be,,"What do you think they value?",It was not Christmas time. There was a Christmas tree.,This is their lobby.,Employees volunteer time in the advice booth.,Notice it looks like something out of a Peanuts cartoon. 
 Okay, we're going through the hallway here at Zappos.,This is a call center. Notice how it's decorated.,Notice people are applauding for us.,They don't know who we are and they don't care. And if they did,they probably wouldn't applaud.,But you'll notice the level of excitement.,Notice, again, how they decorate their office.,Now, what's important to people at Zappos,,these may not be the things that are important to you.,But they value things like fun. And they value creativity.,One of their stated values is, "Be a little bit weird.",And you'll notice they are a little bit weird. 
 So when individuals come together,and find something that unites them,that's greater than their individual competence,,then something very important happens.,The group gels. And it changes,from a group of highly motivated,but fairly individually-centric people,into something larger,,into a tribe that becomes aware of its own existence.,Stage Four tribes can do remarkable things.,But you'll notice we're not at the top of the mountain yet.,There is, in fact, another stage. 
 Now, some of you may not recognize the scene that's up here.,And if you take a look at the headline of Stage Five, which is "Life is Great,",this may seem a little incongruous.,This is a scene or snippet,from the Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa,for which Desmond Tutu won the Nobel Prize.,Now think about that. South Africa,,terrible atrocities had happened in the society.,And people came together,focused only on those two values: truth and reconciliation.,There was no road map. No one had ever done,anything like this before. 
 And in this atmosphere, where the only guidance,was people's values and their noble cause,,what this group accomplished was historic.,And people, at the time, feared that South Africa,would end up going the way that Rwanda has gone,,descending into one skirmish after another,in a civil war that seems to have no end.,In fact, South Africa has not gone down that road.,Largely because people like Desmond Tutu,set up a Stage Five process,to involve the thousands and perhaps millions,of tribes in the country, to bring everyone together.,So, people hear this and they conclude the following,,as did we in doing the study. 
 Okay, got it. I don't want to talk Stage One.,That's like, you know, "Life sucks." Who wants to talk that way?,I don't want to talk like they do,at the particular DMV that's close to where Dave lives.,I really don't want to just say "I'm great,",because that kind of sounds narcissistic, and then I won't have any friends.,Saying, "We're great" -- that sounds pretty good.,But I should really talk Stage Five, right? "Life is great." 
 Well, in fact, there are three somewhat counter-intuitive findings,that come out of all this.,The first one, if you look at the Declaration of Independence,and actually read it,,the phrase that sticks in many of our minds,is things about inalienable rights.,I mean, that's Stage Five, right? Life is great,,oriented only by our values,,no other guidance.,In fact, most of the document is written at Stage Two.,"My life sucks because I live under a tyrant,,also known as King George.,We're great! Who is not great? England!",Sorry. (Laughter) 
 Well, what about other great leaders? What about Gandhi?,What about Martin Luther King?,I mean, surely these were just people who preached, "Life is great," right?,Just one little bit of happiness and joy after another.,In fact, Martin Luther King's most famous line was at Stage Three.,He didn't say "We have a dream." He said, "I have a dream.",Why did he do that? Because most people,are not at Stage Five. 
 Two percent are at Stage One.,About 25 percent are at Stage Two,,saying, in effect, "My life sucks.",48 percent of working tribes say, these are employed tribes,,say, "I'm great and you're not.",And we have to duke it out every day, so we resort to politics.,Only about 22 percent of tribes,are at Stage Four,,oriented by our values, saying "We're great.,And our values are beginning to unite us.",Only two percent, only two percent of tribes,get to Stage Five.,And those are the ones that change the world. 
 So the first little finding from this,is that leaders need to be able to talk all the levels,so that you can touch every person in society.,But you don't leave them where you found them. Okay?,Tribes can only hear one level above and below where they are.,So we have to have the ability to talk,all the levels, to go to where they are.,And then leaders nudge people,within their tribes to the next level.,I'd like to show you some examples of this. 
 One of the people we interviewed was Frank Jordan,,former Mayor of San Francisco. Before that,he was Chief of Police in San Francisco.,And he grew up essentially in Stage One.,And you know what changed his life? It was walking into,one of these, a Boys and Girls Club.,Now here is what happened to this person,who eventually became Mayor of San Francisco.,He went from being alive and passionate,at Stage One -- remember, "Life sucks,,despairing hostility, I will do whatever it takes to survive" --,to walking into a Boys and Girls Club,,folding his arms, sitting down in a chair,,and saying, "Wow. My life really sucks.,I don't know anybody.,I mean, if I was into boxing, like they were,,then my life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does.,So I'm going to sit here in my chair and not do anything." 
 In fact, that's progress.,We move people from Stage One to Stage Two,by getting them in a new tribe,and then, over time, getting them connected.,So, what about moving,from Stage Three to Stage Four?,I want to argue that we're doing that right here.,TED represents a set of values,,and as we unite around these values,,something really interesting begins to emerge. 
 If you want this experience to live on,as something historic,,then at the reception tonight I'd like to encourage you to do something,beyond what people normally do,and call networking.,Which is not just to meet new people,and extend your reach, extend your influence,,but instead, find someone you don't know,,and find someone else you don't know,,and introduce them.,That's called a triadic relationship. 
 See, people who build world-changing tribes do that.,They extend the reach of their tribes,by connecting them, not just to myself,,so that my following is greater,,but I connect people who don't know each other,to something greater than themselves.,And ultimately that adds to their values. 
 But we're not done yet. Because then how do we go from Stage Four,,which is great, to Stage Five?,The story that I like to end with is this. It comes out of,a place called the Gallup Organization.,You know they do polls, right?,So it's Stage Four. We're great. Who is not great?,Pretty much everybody else who does polls.,If Gallup releases a poll on the same day that NBC releases a poll,,people will pay attention to the Gallup poll. Okay, we understand that.,So, they were bored.,They wanted to change the world. So here is the question someone asked. 
 "How could we,,instead of just polling what Asia thinks,or what the United States thinks,,or who thinks what about Obama,versus McCain or something like that,,what does the entire world think?",And they found a way to do the first-ever world poll.,They had people involved who were Nobel laureates,in economics, who reported being bored.,And suddenly they pulled out sheets of paper,and were trying to figure out, "How do we survey the population,of Sub-Saharan Africa?,How do we survey populations that don't have access to technology,,and speak languages we don't speak,,and we don't know anyone who speaks those languages. Because in order,to achieve on this great mission,,we have to be able to do it.,Incidentally, they did pull it off.,And they released the first-ever world poll. 
 So I'd like to leave you with these thoughts.,First of all: we all form tribes, all of us.,You're in tribes here. Hopefully you're extending the reach,of the tribes that you have.,But the question on the table is this:,What kind of an impact are the tribes,that you are in making?,You're hearing one presentation after another,,often representing a group of people, a tribe,,about how they have changed the world.,If you do what we've talked about, you listen,for how people actually communicate in the tribes that you're in.,And you don't leave them where they are. You nudge them forward.,You remember to talk all five culture stages.,Because we've got people in all five, around us.,And the question that I'd like to leave you with is this:,Will your tribes change the world?,Thank you very much.,(Applause)I have had the distinct pleasure,of living inside two biospheres.,Of course we all here in this room live in Biosphere 1.,I've also lived in Biosphere 2.,And the wonderful thing about that is that I get to compare biospheres.,And hopefully from that I get to learn something. 
 So what did I learn? Well,,here I am inside Biosphere 2, making a pizza.,So I am harvesting the wheat, in order to make the dough.,And then of course I have to milk the goats,and feed the goats in order to make the cheese.,It took me four months in Biosphere 2 to make a pizza.,Here in Biosphere 1, well it takes me about two minutes,,because I pick up the phone and I call and say,,"Hey, can you deliver the pizza?" 
 So Biosphere 2,was essentially a three-acre,,entirely sealed, miniature world,that I lived in for two years and 20 minutes.,(Laughter),Over the top it was sealed with steel and glass,,underneath it was sealed with a pan of steel --,essentially entirely sealed.,So we had our own miniature rainforest,,a private beach with a coral reef.,We had a savanna, a marsh, a desert.,We had our own half-acre farm that we had to grow everything.,And of course we had our human habitat, where we lived. 
 Back in the mid-'80s when we were designing Biosphere 2,,we had to ask ourselves some pretty basic questions.,I mean, what is a biosphere?,Back then, yes, I guess we all know now,that it is essentially the sphere of life around the Earth, right?,Well, you have to get a little more specific than that if you're going to build one.,And so we decided that what it really is,is that it is entirely materially closed --,that is, nothing goes in or out at all, no material --,and energetically open,,which is essentially what planet Earth is. 
 This is a chamber that was 1/400th the size of Biosphere 2,that we called our Test Module.,And the very first day that this fellow, John Allen,,walked in, to spend a couple of days in there,with all the plants and animals and bacteria that we'd put in there,to hopefully keep him alive,,the doctors were incredibly concerned,that he was going to succumb to some dreadful toxin,,or that his lungs were going to get choked with bacteria or something, fungus.,But of course none of that happened. 
 And over the ensuing few years,,there were great sagas about designing Biosphere 2.,But by 1991,we finally had this thing built.,And it was time for us to go in,and give it a go.,We needed to know,,is life this malleable?,Can you take this biosphere,,that has evolved on a planetary scale,,and jam it into a little bottle,,and will it survive?,Big questions.,And we wanted to know this both for being able to go somewhere else,in the universe -- if we were going to go to Mars, for instance,,would we take a biosphere with us, to live in it?,We also wanted to know so we can understand more about,the Earth that we all live in.,Well, in 1991 it was finally time for us to go in,and try out this baby.,Let's take it on a maiden voyage.,Will it work? Or will something happen,that we can't understand and we can't fix,,thereby negating the concept of man-made biospheres? 
 So eight of us went in: four men and four women.,More on that later.,(Laughter),And this is the world that we lived in.,So, on the top, we had,these beautiful rainforests and an ocean,,and underneath we had all this technosphere, we called it,,which is where all the pumps and the valves,and the water tanks and the air handlers, and all of that.,One of the Biospherians called it "garden of Eden,on top of an aircraft carrier.",And then also we had the human habitat of course,,with the laboratories, and all of that.,This is the agriculture.,It was essentially an organic farm. 
 The day I walked into Biosphere 2,,I was, for the first time,,breathing a completely different atmosphere,than everybody else in the world,,except seven other people.,At that moment I became part of that biosphere.,And I don't mean that in an abstract sense;,I mean it rather literally.,When I breathed out, my CO2,fed the sweet potatoes that I was growing.,And we ate an awful lot of the sweet potatoes.,(Laughter),And those sweet potatoes,became part of me.,In fact, we ate so many sweet potatoes,I became orange with sweet potato.,I literally was eating the same carbon over and over again.,I was eating myself in some strange sort of bizarre way. 
 When it came to our atmosphere, however,,it wasn't that much of a joke over the long term,,because it turned out that we were losing oxygen, quite a lot of oxygen.,And we knew that we were losing CO2.,And so we were working to sequester carbon.,Good lord -- we know that term now.,We were growing plants like crazy.,We were taking their biomass, storing them in the basement,,growing plants, going around, around, around,,trying to take all of that carbon out of the atmosphere.,We were trying to stop carbon from going into the atmosphere.,We stopped irrigating our soil, as much as we could.,We stopped tilling, so that we could prevent greenhouse gasses from going into the air.,But our oxygen was going down faster,than our CO2 was going up, which was quite unexpected,,because we had seen them going in tandem in the test module.,And it was like playing atomic hide-and-seek.,We had lost seven tons of oxygen.,And we had no clue where it was. 
 And I tell you, when you lose a lot of oxygen --,and our oxygen went down quite far;,it went from 21 percent down to 14.2 percent --,my goodness, do you feel dreadful.,I mean we were dragging ourselves around the Biosphere.,And we had sleep apnea at night.,So you'd wake up gasping with breath,,because your blood chemistry has changed.,And that you literally do that. You stop breathing and then you -- (Gasps) --,take a breath and it wakes you up. And it's very irritating.,And everybody outside thought we were dying.,I mean, the media was making it sound like were were dying.,And I had to call up my mother every other day saying, "No, Mum, it's fine, fine.,We're not dead. We're fine. We're fine.",And the doctor was, in fact, checking us,to make sure we were, in fact, fine.,But in fact he was the person who was most susceptible to the oxygen.,And one day he couldn't add up a line of figures.,And it was time for us to put oxygen in.,And you might think, well,,"Boy, your life support system,was failing you. Wasn't that dreadful?",Yes. In a sense it was terrifying.,Except that I knew I could walk out the airlock door,at any time, if it really got bad,,though who was going to say, "I can't take it anymore!"?,Not me, that was for sure. 
 But on the other hand, it was the scientific gold of the project,,because we could really crank this baby up,,as a scientific tool,,and see if we could, in fact, find,where those seven tons of oxygen had gone.,And we did indeed find it.,And we found it in the concrete.,Essentially it had done something very simple.,We had put too much carbon in the soil in the form of compost.,It broke down; it took oxygen out of the air;,it put CO2 into the air; and it went into the concrete.,Pretty straightforward really. 
 So at the end of the two years,when we came out, we were elated,,because, in fact, although you might say,we had discovered something that was quite "uhh,",when your oxygen is going down,,stopped working, essentially, in your life support system,,that's a very bad failure.,Except that we knew what it was. And we knew how to fix it.,And nothing else emerged,that really was as serious as that.,And we proved the concept, more or less.,People, on the other hand, was a different subject.,We were -- yeah I don't know that we were fixable.,We all went quite nuts, I will say. 
 And the day I came out of Biosphere 2,,I was thrilled I was going to see all my family and my friends.,For two years I'd been seeing people through the glass.,And everybody ran up to me.,And I recoiled. They stank!,People stink!,We stink of hairspray and underarm deodorant,,and all kinds of stuff.,Now we had stuff inside Biosphere to keep ourselves clean,,but nothing with perfume.,And boy do we stink out here.,Not only that,,but I lost touch of where my food came from.,I had been growing all my own food.,I had no idea what was in my food, where it came from.,I didn't even recognize half the names in most of the food that I was eating.,In fact, I would stand for hours in the aisles of shops,,reading all the names on all of the things.,People must have thought I was nuts.,It was really quite astonishing.,And I slowly lost track,of where I was in this big biosphere, in this big biosphere that we all live in.,In Biosphere 2 I totally understood,that I had a huge impact on my biosphere, everyday,,and it had an impact on me,,very viscerally, very literally. 
 So I went about my business:,Paragon Space Development Corporation,,a little firm I started with people while I was in the Biosphere,,because I had nothing else to do.,And one of the things we did was,try to figure out: how small can you make these biospheres,,and what can you do with them?,And so we sent one onto the Mir Space Station.,We had one on the shuttle and one on the International Space Station,,for 16 months, where we managed to produce,the first organisms to go through,complete multiple life cycles in space --,really pushing the envelope,of understanding how malleable,our life systems are. 
 And I'm also proud to announce,that you're getting a sneak preview -- on Friday we're going to announce,that we're actually forming a team,to develop a system to grow plants on the Moon,,which is going to be pretty fun.,And the legacy of that is a system that we were designing:,an entirely sealed system to grow plants to grow on Mars.,And part of that is that we had to model,very rapid circulation of CO2,and oxygen and water through this plant system. 
 As a result of that modeling,I ended up in all places,,in Eritrea, in the Horn of Africa.,Eritrea, formerly part of Ethiopia,,is one of those places that is astonishingly beautiful,,incredibly stark, and I have no understanding,of how people eke out a living there.,It is so dry.,This is what I saw.,But this is also what I saw.,I saw a company that had,taken seawater,and sand, and they were growing,a kind of crop that will grow on pure salt water without having to treat it.,And it will produce a food crop.,In this case it was oilseed.,It was astonishing. They were also producing mangroves,in a plantation.,And the mangroves were providing wood,and honey and leaves for the animals,,so that they could produce milk and whatnot,,like we had in the Biosphere. 
 And all of it was coming from this: shrimp farms.,Shrimp farms are a scourge on the earth,,frankly, from an environmental point of view.,They pour huge amounts of pollutants into the ocean.,They also pollute their next-door neighbors.,So they're all shitting each other's ponds, quite literally.,And what this project was doing,was taking the effluent of these,,and turning them into all of this food.,They were literally turning pollution into abundance for a desert people.,They had created an industrial ecosystem, of a sense. 
 I was there because I was actually modeling the mangrove portion,for a carbon credit program, under the U.N.,Kyoto Protocol system.,And as I was modeling this mangrove swamp,,I was thinking to myself, "How do you put a box around this?",When I'm modeling a plant in a box, literally,,I know where to draw the boundary.,In a mangrove forest like this I have no idea.,Well, of course you have to draw the boundary around the whole of the Earth.,And understand its interactions with the entire Earth.,And put your project in that context. 
 Around the world today we're seeing an incredible transformation,,from what I would call a biocidal species,,one that -- whether we intentionally or unintentionally --,have designed our systems to kill life, a lot of the time.,This is in fact, this beautiful photograph,,is in fact over the Amazon.,And here the light green are areas of massive deforestation.,And those beautiful wispy clouds,are, in fact, fires, human-made fires.,We're in the process of transforming from this,,to what I would call a biophilic society,,one where we learn to nurture society.,Now it may not seem like it, but we are.,It is happening all across the world,,in every kind of walk of life,,and every kind of career,and industry that you can think of.,And I think often times people get lost in that.,They go, "But how can I possibly find my way in that?,It's such a huge subject.",And I would say that the small stuff counts. It really does. 
 This is the story of a rake in my backyard.,This was my backyard,,very early on, when I bought my property.,And in Arizona, of course, everybody puts gravel down.,And they like to keep everything beautifully raked. And they keep all the leaves away.,And on Sunday morning the neighbors leaf blower comes out,,and I want to throttle them.,It's a certain type of aesthetic.,We're very uncomfortable with untidiness.,And I threw away my rake.,And I let all of the leaves fall from the trees that I have on my property.,And over time, essentially what have I been doing?,I've been building topsoil.,And so now all the birds come in. And I have hawks.,And I have an oasis.,This is what happens every spring. For six weeks,,six to eight weeks, I have this flush of green oasis.,This is actually in a riparian area.,And all of Tucson could be like this,if everybody would just revolt and throw away the rake.,The small stuff counts. 
 The Industrial Revolution -- and Prometheus --,has given us this, the ability to light up the world.,It has also given us this,,the ability to look at the world from the outside.,Now we may not all have,another biosphere that we can run to,,and compare it to this biosphere.,But we can look at the world,,and try to understand where we are in its context,,and how we choose to interact with it. 
 And if you lose where you are in your biosphere,,or are perhaps having a difficulty connecting,with where you are in the biosphere,,I would say to you,,take a deep breath.,The yogis had it right.,Breath does, in fact, connect us all,in a very literal way.,Take a breath now.,And as you breathe, think,about what is in your breath.,There perhaps is the CO2 from the person sitting next-door to you.,Maybe there is a little bit of oxygen,from some algae on the beach not far from here.,It also connects us in time.,There may be some carbon in your breath,from the dinosaurs.,There could also be carbon that you are exhaling now,that will be in the breath,of your great-great-great-grandchildren.,Thank you. (Applause)One of the biggest challenges in computer graphics,has been being able to create a photo-real,,digital human face.,And one of the reasons it is so difficult is that, unlike aliens and dinosaurs,,we look at human faces every day.,They are very important to how we communicate with each other.,As a result, we're tuned in to the subtlest things,that could possibly be wrong with a computer rendering,,in order to believe whether these things are realistic. 
 And what I'm going to do in the next five minutes,is take you through a process,where we tried to create a reasonably photo-realistic computer-generated face,,using some computer graphics technology we've developed,,and also some collaborators at a company called Image Metrics.,And we're going to try to do a photo-real face,of an actress named Emily O'Brien, who is right there.,And that's actually a completely computer-generated rendering of her face.,By the end of the talk, we're going to see it move. 
 The way that we did this is we tried to start with Emily herself,,who was gracious enough to come to our laboratory,in Marina Del Rey, and sit for a session in Light Stage 5.,This is a face-scanning sphere, with 156 white LEDs all around,that allow us to photograph her,in a series of very controlled illumination conditions.,And the lighting that we use these days looks something like this.,We shoot all of these photographs in about three seconds. 
 And we basically capture enough information,with video projector patterns that drape over the contours of her face,,and different principle directions of light from the light stage,,to figure out both the coarse-scale,and the fine-scale detail of her face.,If we zoom in on this photograph right here,,we can see it's a really nice photograph to have of her,,because she is lit from absolutely everywhere at the same time,to get a nice image of her facial texture. 
 And in addition, we've actually used polarizers on all the lights --,just like polarized sunglasses can block,the glare off of the road,,polarizers can block the shine off of the skin,,so we don't get all those specular reflections to take this map.,Now, if we turn the polarizers around just a little bit,,we can actually bring that specular reflection,of the skin back in,,and you can see she looks kind of shiny and oily at this point.,If you take the difference between these two images here,,you can get an image lit from the entire sphere of light,of just the shine off of Emily's skin. 
 I don't think any photograph like this had ever been taken,before we had done this.,And this is very important light to capture,,because this is the light that reflects off the first surface of the skin.,It doesn't get underneath the translucent,layers of the skin and blur out.,And, as a result, it's a very good cue,to the detailed shape of the skin-pore structure,and all of the fine wrinkles that all of us have,,the things that actually make us look like real humans. 
 So, if we use information that comes off of this specular reflection,,we can go from a traditional face scan,that might have the gross contours of the face and the basic shape,,and augment it with information,that puts in all of that skin pore structure and fine wrinkles.,And, even more importantly,,since this is a photometric process that only takes three seconds to capture,,we can shoot Emily,in just part of an afternoon,,in many different facial poses and facial expressions. 
 So, here you can see her moving her eyes around, moving her mouth around.,And these we're actually going to use to create a photo-real digital character.,If you take a look at these scans that we have of Emily,,you can see that the human face does an enormous amount of amazing things,as it goes into different facial expressions.,You can see things. Not only the face shape changes,,but all sorts of different skin buckling and skin wrinkling occurs.,You can see that the skin pore structure changes enormously,from stretched skin pores,to the regular skin texture.,You can see the furrows in the brow and how the microstructure changes there.,You can see muscles pulling down at flesh to bring her eyebrows down.,Her muscles bulging in her forehead when she winces like that. 
 In addition to this kind of high-resolution geometry,,since it's all captured with cameras, we've got a great texture map to use for the face.,And by looking at how the different color channels of the illumination,,the red and the green and the blue,,diffuse the light differently,,we can come up with a way of shading the skin on the computer.,Then, instead of looking like a plaster mannequin,,it actually looks like it's made out of living human flesh. 
 And this is what we used,to give to the company Image Metrics,to create a rigged, digital version of Emily.,We're just seeing the coarse-scale geometry here.,But they basically created a digital puppet of her,,where you can pull on these various strings,,and it actually moves her face in ways that are,completely consistent with the scans that we took.,And, in addition to the coarse-scale geometry,,they also used all of that detail,to create a set of what are called "displacement maps",that animate as well.,These are the displacement maps here.,And you can see those different wrinkles actually show up as she animates. 
 So the next process was then to animate her.,We actually used one of her own performances to provide the source data.,So, by analyzing this video with computer vision techniques,,they were able to drive the facial rig,with the computer-generated performance.,So what you're going to see now, after this,,is a completely photo-real digital face.,We can turn the volume up a little bit if that's available. 
 Emily: Image Metrics is a markerless, performance-driven animation company.,We specialize in high-quality facial animation,for video games and films.,Image Metrics is a markerless, performance-driven animation company.,We specialize in high quality facial animation,for video games and films. 
 Paul Debevec: So, if we break that down into layers, here's that diffuse component,we saw in the first slide.,Here is the specular component animating.,You can see all the wrinkles happening there.,And there is the underlying wireframe mesh.,And that is Emily herself. 
 Now, where are we going with this here?,We've gone a little bit beyond Light Stage 5. This is Light Stage 6,,and we're looking at taking this technology,and applying it to whole human bodies.,This is Bruce Lawmen, one of our researchers in the group,,who graciously agreed to get captured running in the Light Stage.,And let's take a look at a computer-generated version,of Bruce, running in a new environment.,And thank you very much.,(Applause)This is my first trip,,my first foreign trip as a first lady.,Can you believe that?,(Applause),And while this is not my first visit to the U.K.,,I have to say that I am glad that this is my first official visit.,The special relationship between the United States and the U.K.,is based not only on the relationship between governments,,but the common language and the values that we share,,and I'm reminded of that by watching you all today.,During my visit I've been especially honored,to meet some of Britain's most extraordinary women --,women who are paving the way for all of you. 
 And I'm honored to meet you,,the future leaders of Great Britain and this world.,And although the circumstances of our lives may seem very distant,,with me standing here as the First Lady of the United States of America,,and you, just getting through school,,I want you to know that we have very much in common.,For nothing in my life's path,would have predicted that I'd be standing here,as the first African-American First Lady,of the United States of America.,There is nothing in my story that would land me here.,I wasn't raised with wealth or resources,or any social standing to speak of.,I was raised on the South Side of Chicago.,That's the real part of Chicago.,And I was the product of a working-class community.,My father was a city worker all of his life,,and my mother was a stay-at-home mom.,And she stayed at home to take care of me and my older brother.,Neither of them attended university.,My dad was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis,in the prime of his life.,But even as it got harder for him to walk,and get dressed in the morning --,I saw him struggle more and more --,my father never complained about his struggle.,He was grateful for what he had.,He just woke up a little earlier and worked a little harder.,And my brother and I were raised with all that you really need:,love, strong values,and a belief that with a good education,and a whole lot of hard work,,that there was nothing that we could not do. 
 I am an example of what's possible,when girls from the very beginning of their lives,are loved and nurtured by the people around them.,I was surrounded by extraordinary women in my life:,grandmothers, teachers, aunts, cousins, neighbors,,who taught me about quiet strength and dignity.,And my mother, the most important role model in my life,,who lives with us at the White House,and helps to care for our two little daughters,,Malia and Sasha.,She's an active presence in their lives, as well as mine,,and is instilling in them,the same values that she taught me and my brother:,things like compassion, and integrity,,and confidence, and perseverance --,all of that wrapped up in an unconditional love,that only a grandmother can give. 
 I was also fortunate enough to be cherished and encouraged,by some strong male role models as well,,including my father, my brother, uncles and grandfathers.,The men in my life taught me some important things, as well.,They taught me about what a respectful relationship,should look like between men and women.,They taught me about what a strong marriage feels like:,that it's built on faith and commitment,and an admiration for each other's unique gifts.,They taught me about what it means,to be a father,and to raise a family.,And not only to invest in your own home,but to reach out and help raise kids,in the broader community. 
 And these were the same qualities,that I looked for in my own husband,,Barack Obama.,And when we first met,,one of the things that I remember is that he took me out on a date.,And his date was to go with him to a community meeting.,(Laughter),I know, how romantic.,(Laughter),But when we met, Barack was a community organizer.,He worked, helping people to find jobs,and to try to bring resources into struggling neighborhoods.,As he talked to the residents in that community center,,he talked about two concepts.,He talked about "the world as it is" and "the world as it should be.",And I talked about this throughout the entire campaign.,What he said, that all too often,,is that we accept the distance between those two ideas.,And sometimes we settle for the world as it is,,even when it doesn't reflect our values and aspirations.,But Barack reminded us on that day,,all of us in that room, that we all know,what our world should look like.,We know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like.,We all know.,And he urged the people in that meeting,,in that community,,to devote themselves to closing the gap,between those two ideas,,to work together to try to make the world as it is,and the world as it should be, one and the same. 
 And I think about that today because I am,reminded and convinced that all of you in this school,are very important parts of closing that gap.,You are the women who will build the world as it should be.,You're going to write the next chapter in history.,Not just for yourselves, but for your generation,and generations to come.,And that's why getting a good education,is so important.,That's why all of this that you're going through --,the ups and the downs, the teachers that you love and the teachers that you don't --,why it's so important.,Because communities and countries and ultimately the world,are only as strong as the health of their women.,And that's important to keep in mind. 
 Part of that health includes an outstanding education.,The difference between a struggling family and a healthy one,is often the presence of an empowered woman,or women at the center of that family.,The difference between a broken community and a thriving one,is often the healthy respect between men and women,who appreciate the contributions each other makes to society.,The difference between a languishing nation,and one that will flourish,is the recognition that we need equal access to education,for both boys and girls. 
 And this school, named after the U.K.'s first female doctor,,and the surrounding buildings named for Mexican artist Frida Kahlo,,Mary Seacole,,the Jamaican nurse known as the "black Florence Nightingale,",and the English author, Emily Bronte,,honor women who fought sexism, racism and ignorance,,to pursue their passions to feed their own souls.,They allowed for no obstacles.,As the sign said back there, "without limitations.",They knew no other way to live,than to follow their dreams.,And having done so, these women,moved many obstacles.,And they opened many new doors,for millions of female doctors and nurses,and artists and authors,,all of whom have followed them.,And by getting a good education,,you too can control your own destiny. 
 Please remember that.,If you want to know the reason why I'm standing here,,it's because of education.,I never cut class. Sorry, I don't know if anybody is cutting class.,I never did it.,I loved getting As.,I liked being smart.,I liked being on time. I liked getting my work done.,I thought being smart was cooler than anything in the world.,And you too, with these same values,,can control your own destiny.,You too can pave the way.,You too can realize your dreams,,and then your job is to reach back,and to help someone just like you do the same thing.,History proves that it doesn't matter,whether you come from a council estate,or a country estate. 
 Your success will be determined,by your own fortitude,,your own confidence, your own individual hard work.,That is true. That is the reality of the world that we live in.,You now have control over your own destiny.,And it won't be easy -- that's for sure.,But you have everything you need.,Everything you need to succeed,,you already have, right here. 
 My husband works in this big office.,They call it the Oval Office.,In the White House, there's the desk that he sits at --,it's called the Resolute desk.,It was built by the timber of Her Majesty's Ship Resolute,and given by Queen Victoria.,It's an enduring symbol of the friendship between our two nations.,And its name, Resolute,,is a reminder of the strength of character that's required,not only to lead a country,,but to live a life of purpose, as well.,And I hope in pursuing your dreams, you all remain resolute,,that you go forward without limits,,and that you use your talents -- because there are many; we've seen them;,it's there --,that you use them to create the world as it should be.,Because we are counting on you.,We are counting on every single one of you,to be the very best that you can be.,Because the world is big.,And it's full of challenges.,And we need strong, smart, confident young women,to stand up and take the reins. 
 We know you can do it. We love you. Thank you so much. 
 (Applause)I have a vision for each one of you,,and the vision I have for you,is that when you wake up in the morning,,your blood is singing at the thoughtnof being who you are,and doing what you do;,that as you go through the day,,you can literally sinknto your knees in gratitude,at the tremendous good fortunenthat's been bestowed on you;,that as you go through the day,,you become radiantly alive several times.,And if your life isn't like that,,I'd like to humbly suggestnthat you're wasting your life.,A life is too short to be wasted. 
 So what I propose to donin the next 17 minutes --,I've used up one minute already --,is to give you a set of powerful tools,which can get you started on being there.,Is that of interest to you? 
 Audience: Yes. 
 Srikumar Rao: OK. 
 This is a conference on happiness,,but even if it wasn'tna conference on happiness,,would it be right if I saidnthat in some way, shape, fashion or form,,you're devoting your entire life,to being happy?,Everything you do -- your job, family,nchildren, relationships, whatever --,is a quest for happiness.,Correct? 
 I'd like you to think about the following:,What do you have to get,in order to be happy?,We're just going to spendna minute on this.,What do you have to getnin order to be happy? 
 Anybody, quick? 
 When I conduct this experiment,na bunch of stuff comes up:,vast wealth, trophy spouse, good health,nlots of travel, time, etc, etc, etc.,Right now, if you were to think about it,,you probably have a listnof, "Here's what I need to get,in order to be happy.",I would like you to consider this:,anything that you can get --,let me repeat that -- anythingnyou can get, you can un-get.,Is that correct?,So, vast wealth can make you happy.nVast wealth can disappear tomorrow.,A number of people in the financial sectornhave discovered this already.,So whatever you getnthat can make you happy,can go away.,Where does that leave you?,Not a very nice place, right? 
 I have a different propositionnto suggest to you.,What I have to suggest to you,is that there is nothingnthat you have to get, do or be,in order to be happy.,Let me repeat that:,there is nothing that you have to get,ndo or be in order to be happy.,In fact, happiness is your innate nature.,It is hardwired into you.nIt is part of your DNA.,You cannot not be happy. 
 Now, all of you are very polite,,and in some of the other forumsnI speak in, such as top business schools,,they're not so polite.,And invariably, somebody articulatesnwhat many of you are thinking,,which is: "If happinessnis my innate nature,,how come I am not experiencing it?,How come I am experiencing my life sucks?" 
 (Laughter) 
 And the answer to thatnis actually very simple.,You have spent your entire life,learning to be unhappy.,Let me repeat that: you have spentnyour entire life learning to be unhappy.,And the way we learn to be unhappy,is by buying intona particular mental model. 
 A mental model is a notion we haventhat this is the way the world works.,All of us have mental models,nwe've got dozens of mental models.,We've got mental modelsnon how to find a job,,how to get ahead at work,nhow to pick a restaurant to eat at,,how to have a moviento go to ... dozens of them.,The problem isn'tnthat we have mental models.,The problem is that we don't knownthat we have mental models.,We think this is the way the world works.,And the more we invest in a mental model,,the more it appears that this, in fact,nis the way the world works.,But it isn't: it's just a mental model,,and the mental model we haventhat we buy into so strongly,is that we have to get somethingnso we can do something,so we can be something.,Like, we have to get a great deal of moneynso we can travel to exotic places,so we can be happy.,We have to be in a relationshipnso we can have great sex,so we can be happy. 
 All of this is a variationnof the if-then model.,And the if-then model is:,if this happens,,then we will be happy.,If I were to get a better job,nif I were to get more money,,if my boss would have a heart attack,,if only I was married,nif only my wife would leave me -- 
 (Laughter) 
 if only I had children,,if my children would grow upnand go to college ...,It doesn't matter what it is.,The whole notion is if this happens,,then I will be happy. 
 And right now, the only thingnthat's different,between the persons in this audience,is what is the particular "if"nthat you are focusing on?,And the only thing that's different,between you nownand where you were 10 years ago,is what is the particular "if"nthat you were focusing on?,Think about your life 10 years ago.,Spend a minute doing that.,Ten years ago, if you remember clearly,,there were certain things you wanted.,Is that correct?,Odds are pretty good,that many of those things you wantedn10 years ago you now have.,Is that correct?,Where has that left you?,In exactly the same place, right? 
 What we don't realizenis the model itself is flawed.,The if-then model --n"If this happens I will be happy" --,the model itself is flawed.,But instead of recognizingnthat it is the model itself that's flawed,,what we do is spendnenormous amounts of time,changing the "if.","Oh, well, I thought if I becamenCEO it would help,,but now I realize it's notnthat I want to become a CEO.,I want to become the billionaire CEO,,and then I will be happy.",You've got your own variation on that.,But it's the model itself that's flawed,nnot what you put on the "if" side,of the equation.,I can demonstrate that to you. 
 Can any of you recall a time,when you were confronted with a scenenof such spectacular beauty,that it took you outside of yourselfninto a place of great serenity?,Maybe a rainbow, a mountain range,,a valley, the sea.,And if you remember that --nraise your hands if you could.,Virtually all of you could, right?,Have you ever wondered why that happened?,The reason that happened is that somehow,,for some reason,,at that instant,,you accepted the universenexactly as it was.,You didn't say,,"That's a beautiful rainbow,nbut it's kind of off to the left,,and if I could move itn200 yards to the right,,it would be ever so much more beautiful." 
 (Laughter) 
 You didn't say,n"That's a beautiful valley,,but the tree in the foregroundnhas too many crooked branches.,So if you gave mena chainsaw and 20 minutes,,I'd make it ever so much better." 
 Oh no, the rainbow off-center,was just fine.,The tree with its crooked branches,was just fine.,And the moment you acceptednthe universe just as it was,,your habitual-wanting self dropped away,,and the happiness which isnyour innate nature surfaced,,and you felt it.,And I know you felt it because now,,even now after all those years,,you can still remember it. 
 The problem is that your life right now,,with all of the problems that you have --,more precisely, all of the problemsnthat you think you have --,is equally perfect.,But you do not accept it.,In fact, you're spending all your time,striving with might and mainnto make it different.,You are not accepting it.,And when you're not accepting it,,you're buying into the if-then model:,if this happens, then I will be happy.,And it's the model itself that is flawed. 
 So let me show you hownyou can get out of that,,or at least you can begin the stepsntowards getting out of that.,I'd like to share with you that action.,We all live our lives because we wantnto achieve something, correct?,You know, we are herenand we want to have something.,Alex wants to havena successful conference.,You know, many of you want to havengreat programs for your companies,that are very successful.,You want to progress, have more money,nall of that, is that correct?,Each of those is an outcome;nyou would like something to happen. 
 Now, I'd like you to thinknabout the following:,actions are within your control,,not entirely, but to a large extent.,The outcome is completelynout of your control.,OK?,Actions are within your control.,The outcome is completelynoutside your control. 
 Have any of you recognizednthat when you have a goal,and you start to work towards it,,some of the timenyou don't achieve your goal,,and some of the time what you get,is the exact opposite of what you wanted?,Has that happened to any of you? 
 Like there was a friend of minenwho said, "Gee, you know,,I have not been payingna lot of attention to my wife,,and this has to change.",So the next timenwe went on a business trip,,he bought a very expensive dress for her.,And this was his way of showing,nyou know, I care for you,,and nice things would happen.,And when he presented the giftnto his wife, her immediate reaction was,,"After 20 years of marriage,nyou don't know my size?" 
 (Laughter) 
 "And furthermore, don't you knownI never wear this kind of thing?",And the next thing you know,nhe had a full-blown marital spat.,Has that happened to any of you?,You've taken actionnfor a particular outcome,and the outcome you gotnwas the exact opposite,of what you wanted?,Happens all the time. 
 Well, we live in a worldnwhere what we think of,,what we invest in,,is the outcome.,We define our life in the following way:,here I am, here is where I want to go,,these are the steps I have to takenin order to get from where I am,to where I want to go,,and if I succeed, life is wonderful.,And if I don't, then I have failed,,life is no good, life sucks.,True? False?,That is how we live.,We invest in the outcome,,and as I've just pointed out,,the outcome is frequently differentnfrom what we would like,,and sometimes the diametric oppositenof what we would like.,You invest in the outcomenand you are guaranteed to have,more than your share of frustration, angst,and all the rest of the stuffnthat makes life suck. 
 There is an alternative.,And the alternative is that you do notninvest in the outcome,,you invest in the process.,And the best way to describe thatnis a quote by John Wooden.,I don't know how many of younare familiar with John Wooden.,He's very well-known in the United States,and certainly among basketball fans.,He's the only person ever to makenthe basketball Hall of Fame,both as a player and as a coach.,And what he told his entering team --,he led UCLA to an unprecedented numbernof victories and finals in the NCAA --,and what he used to tell any new teamnis he never spoke about winning.,He always said, "When it's overnand you look in the mirror,,did you do the bestnthat you were capable of?,And if you did the bestnthat you were capable of,,the score doesn't matter.,But I would suspect that if you didnthe best that you were capable of,,you will find the score to your liking.",That is investing in a process. 
 What we do is the exact opposite.,We invest in the outcome.,This is what I want -- oh,nI want it so desperately,,because if I get it I will be happy.,And you try with might and main,nto do whatever you can,,but you are always focusingnon, "This is the outcome.",Now, focusing on the outcome is fine.,It gives you direction.,Investing in the outcome means,that you make the achievementnof a particular outcome,dependent for your well-being.,And that is a surefire recipe for failure. 
 What you can do is something else.,You can invest in the process.,That is, once you have determined,nhere is where I am,,here is where I want to be,nand that's fine,,you focus on the outcome onlynto the extent that it gives you direction,,and then you invest yourselfncompletely in the process.,You say, here are the stepsnyou want to take,,and you put everything into it.,And if you succeed, wonderful.,And if you don't succeed,,still wonderful,,because now you have a new starting point,nand from that new starting point,,you select another outcome and keep going.,And when you do that, you will findnthat every day is a blast. 
 Let me give you an example.,And if you have children -- raisenyour hands if you have children.,Have you ever seenna small child learn to walk?,What happens, and this happensntypically between 11 and 13 months,,is the child gets upnand she sees everybody walking,,she wants to walk, she gets up,nshe falls down, she starts crying,and momma runs up and comforts her,nkisses the place, makes it well.,She tries again, falls down,nmommy runs up again.,After some time, mommy feels tirednand no longer runs up,and the child stops crying,,and then she gets up, takes a step,and doesn't fall down,nand then she takes another,,and a beautiful smile comes on her face.,And very soon, generally within 24 hours,nshe's walking all over the place,,upsetting your living room arrangements.,And you know you've gonento a new stage of parenting.,Right? 
 Now, imagine what would happen,if each time the child fell,,she would say, "Oh my God, I failed again.,I'm never going to learn to walk.",And you have to get counseling for her,to help her deal withnfeelings of inadequacy,and not being able to achievenand fail yet again.,How long do you think it would take hernto learn to walk if you had to do that,,if every three times she fell down,nyou had to get a counselor,to counsel her and so on?,Sounds funny, doesn't it?,But that is exactly what we're doing.,What the child is doingnis focusing on the process.,She's investing in the process,,not in the outcome. 
 What we do is the exact opposite.,As we grow up, we lose the abilitynto invest in the process,,we start investing in the outcome.,By definition the outcomenis outside of our control,,and if that's where we spendnall of our emotional energy,,we are going to get drained as we do. 
 But if, on the other hand, we said,,"Here is the outcome,nI am going to invest in the process,and give it every single bit I could,",every day is a blast,,and you're well on your way to achievingnthe vision that I outlined to you. 
 The question that I get all the time,nis people say, "Professor Rao,,but nothing makes me passionate.",So I say, "OK, what would?",And they invariably come up with,nyou know, here is a list of things.,Here's my job and here's how much it pays,,this is the kind of person my boss is,,the kind of people my colleagues are,,and here's how my customers are,nhere's how much I travel,,here's how big my office is,nhow deep the carpeting is,,how many windows I have --,a bunch of parameters. 
 And what I tell them is whatnI want to share with you,,because all of that stuff --nfirst of all, it doesn't exist.,But second, even if it didnand you were plugged into it,,it would not take more than six months,for you to be the same sorry,nmiserable self there as you are now,,because passion exists inside you.,It does not exist in the job.,And if you don't find a waynto ignite it within you,right where you are,,you are not going to find it outside.,But if you do find a waynto ignite it where you are,,then you will find that the external world,rearranges itself,to accommodate the new personnthat you are becoming.,And as you do that, you will findnthat miracles happen on a regular basis.,Persons come upnwhom you're delighted to meet.,New people enter your life.,It's just a breeze,,because all you do in your lifenis you take journeys. 
 You came here to this conference;nyou went on a journey.,You hang around the water cooler,,talking about how terriblenyour place of work is;,you went on a journey.,You watch "Desperate Housewives,"nyou go on a journey.,You go on a journey,where 40-something women are havingnaffairs with 19-something gardeners,while the husbandsnare playing around with models.,All you do is go on journeys.,There's nothing wrong with that,nbut just ask yourself,,"Is this a journey I want to take?,Does this take me to a placenI want to spend time?" 
 And if you start doing that,,you will find that your life changes.,The kind of people you meet,nthe things you talk about,,the movies you go to,nthe books you read --,everything changes.,And you begin all of that,by focusing on the process. 
 Invest in the process, not in the outcome. 
 Thank you.John Hockenberry: It's great to be here with you, Tom.,And I want to start with a question,that has just been consuming me,since I first became familiar with your work.,In you work there's always this kind of hybrid quality,of a natural force,in some sort of interplay with creative force.,Are they ever in equilibrium,in the way that you see your work? 
 Tom Shannon: Yeah, the subject matter that I'm looking for,,it's usually to solve a question.,I had the question popped into my head:,What does the cone that connects the sun and the Earth look like,if you could connect the two spheres?,And in proportion, what would the size of the sphere,and the length, and what would the taper be to the Earth?,And so I went about and made that sculpture,,turning it out of solid bronze.,And I did one that was about 35 feet long.,The sun end was about four inches in diameter,,and then it tapered over about 35 feet,to about a millimeter at the Earth end.,And so for me, it was really exciting,just to see what it looks like,if you could step outside and into a larger context,,as though you were an astronaut,,and see these two things as an object,,because they are so intimately bound,,and one is meaningless without the other. 
 JH: Is there a relief,in playing with these forces?,And I'm wondering how much of a sense of discovery there is,in playing with these forces. 
 TS: Well, like the magnetically levitated objects --,like that silver one there,,that was the result,of hundreds of experiments with magnets,,trying to find a way to make something float,with the least possible connection to the ground.,So I got it down to just one tether,to be able to support that. 
 JH: Now is this electromagnetic here, or are these static? 
 TS: Those are permanent magnets, yeah. 
 JH: Because if the power went out, there would just be a big noise. 
 TS: Yeah.,It's really unsatisfactory having plug-in art. 
 JH: I agree. 
 TS: The magnetic works,are a combination of gravity and magnetism,,so it's a kind of mixture of these ambient forces,that influence everything.,The sun has a tremendous field,that extends way beyond the planets,and the Earth's magnetic field protects us from the sun.,So there's this huge,invisible shape structures,that magnetism takes in the universe.,But with the pendulum,,it allows me to manifest,these invisible forces,that are holding the magnets up.,My sculptures,are normally very simplified.,I try to refine them down,to very simple forms.,But the paintings become very complex,,because I think the fields,that are supporting them,,they're billowing, and they're interpenetrating,,and they're interference patterns. 
 JH: And they're non-deterministic.,I mean, you don't know necessarily where you're headed when you begin,,even though the forces can be calculated.,So the evolution of this --,I gather this isn't your first pendulum. 
 TS: No. (JH: No.) 
 TS: The first one I did was in the late 70's,,and I just had a simple cone,with a spigot at the bottom of it.,I threw it into an orbit,,and it only had one color,,and when it got to the center, the paint kept running out,,so I had to run in there,,didn't have any control over the spigot remotely.,So that told me right away: I need a remote control device.,But then I started dreaming of having six colors.,I sort of think about it as the DNA --,these colors, the red, blue, yellow,,the primary colors and white and black.,And if you put them together in different combinations --,just like printing in a sense,,like how a magazine color is printed --,and put them under certain forces,,which is orbiting them,or passing them back and forth,or drawing with them,,these amazing things started appearing. 
 JH: It looks like we're loaded for bear here. 
 TS: Yeah, well let's put a couple of canvases.,I'll ask a couple of my sons,to set up the canvases here.,I want to just say --,so this is Jack, Nick and Louie. 
 JH: Thanks guys. 
 TS: So here are the -- 
 JH: All right, I'll get out of the way here. 
 TS: I'm just going to throw this into an orbit,and see if I can paint everybody's shoes in the front. 
 (Laughter) 
 JH: Whoa. That is ...,ooh, nice. 
 TS: So something like this.,I'm doing this as a demo,,and it's more playful,,but inevitably,,all of this can be used.,I can redeem this painting,,just continuing on,,doing layers upon layers.,And I keep it around for a couple of weeks,,and I'm contemplating it,,and I'll do another session with it,and bring it up to another level,,where all of this,becomes the background, the depth of it. 
 JH: That's fantastic.,So the valves at the bottom of those tubes there,are like radio-controlled airplane valves. 
 TS: Yes, they're servos with cams,that pinch these rubber tubes.,And they can pinch them very tight and stop it,,or you can have them wide open.,And all of the colors,come out one central port,at the bottom.,You can always be changing colors, put aluminum paint,,or I could put anything into this.,It could be tomato sauce,,or anything could be dispensed --,sand, powders or anything like that. 
 JH: So many forces there.,You've got gravity, you've got the centrifugal force,,you've got the fluid dynamics.,Each of these beautiful paintings,,are they images in and of themselves,,or are they records,of a physical event,called the pendulum approaching the canvas? 
 TS: Well, this painting here,,I wanted to do something very simple,,a simple, iconic image,of two ripples interfering.,So the one on the right was done first,,and then the one on the left,was done over it.,And then I left gaps,so you could see the one that was done before.,And then when I did the second one,,it really disturbed the piece --,these big blue lines,crashing through the center of it --,and so it created a kind of tension and an overlap.,There are lines in front of the one on the right,,and there are lines behind the one on the left,,and so it takes it into different planes.,What it's also about,,just the little events,,the events of the interpenetration of -- 
 JH: Two stars, or -- 
 TS: Two things that happened --,there's an interference pattern, and then a third thing happens.,There are shapes that come about,just by the marriage,of two events that are happening,,and I'm very interested in that.,Like the occurrence of moire patterns.,Like this green one,,this is a painting I did about 10 years ago,,but it has some --,see, in the upper third --,there are these moires and interference patterns,that are radio kind of imagery.,And that's something that in painting,I've never seen done.,I've never seen a representation,of a kind of radio interference patterns,,which are so ubiquitous,and such an important part of our lives. 
 JH: Is that a literal part of the image,,or is my eye making that interference pattern --,is my eye completing that interference pattern? 
 TS: It is the paint actually,,makes it real.,It's really manifested there.,If I throw a very concentric circle,,or concentric ellipse,,it just dutifully makes,these evenly spaced lines,,which get closer and closer together,,which describes how gravity works.,There's something very appealing,about the exactitude of science,that I really enjoy.,And I love the shapes that I see,in scientific observations,and apparatus,,especially astronomical forms,and the idea of the vastness of it,,the scale,,is very interesting to me. 
 My focus in recent years,has kind of shifted more toward biology.,Some of these paintings, when you look at them very close,,odd things appear,that really look like horses or birds,or crocodiles, elephants.,There are lots of things that appear.,When you look into it, it's sort of like looking at cloud patterns,,but sometimes they're very modeled and highly rendered.,And then there are all these forms,that we don't know what they are,,but they're equally well-resolved,and complex.,So I think, conceivably, those could be predictive.,Because since it has the ability,to make forms,that look like forms that we're familiar with,in biology,,it's also making other forms that we're not familiar with.,And maybe it's the kind of forms,we'll discover underneath the surface of Mars,,where there are probably lakes,with fish swimming under the surface. 
 JH: Oh, let's hope so. Oh, my God, let's.,Oh, please, yes. Oh, I'm so there.,You know, it seems,at this stage in your life,,you also very personally,are in this state of confrontation,with a sort of dissonant --,I suppose it's an electromagnetic force,that somehow governs your Parkinson's,and this creative force,that is both the artist,who is in the here and now,and this sort of arc of your whole life.,Is that relevant to your work? 
 TS: As it turns out,,this device kind of comes in handy,,because I don't have to have,the fine motor skills to do,,that I can operate slides,,which is more of a mental process.,I'm looking at it and making decisions:,It needs more red, it needs more blue,,it needs a different shape.,And so I make these creative decisions,and can execute them,in a much, much simpler way.,I mean, I've got the symptoms.,I guess Parkinson's kind of creeps up over the years,,but at a certain point you start seeing the symptoms.,In my case,,my left hand has a significant tremor,and my left leg also.,I'm left-handed, and so I draw.,All my creations,really start on small drawings,,which I have thousands of,,and it's my way of just thinking.,I draw with a simple pencil,,and at first, the Parkinson's,was really upsetting,,because I couldn't get the pencil to stand still. 
 JH: So you're not a gatekeeper for these forces.,You don't think of yourself as the master of these forces.,You think of yourself as the servant. 
 TS: Nature is -- well, it's a godsend.,It just has so much in it.,And I think nature,wants to express itself,in the sense that we are nature,,humans are of the universe.,The universe is in our mind,,and our minds are in the universe.,And we are expressions,of the universe, basically.,As humans,,ultimately being part of the universe,,we're kind of the spokespeople,or the observer part,of the constituency,of the universe.,And to interface with it,,with a device that lets these forces,that are everywhere,act and show what they can do,,giving them pigment and paint just like an artist,,it's a good ally.,It's a terrific studio assistant. 
 JH: Well, I love the idea,that somewhere within this idea,of fine motion and control,with the traditional skills,that you have with your hand,,some sort of more elemental force gets revealed,,and that's the beauty here.,Tom, thank you so much. It's been really, really great. 
 TS: Thank you, John. 
 (Applause)I want to talk about the transformed media landscape,,and what it means for anybody who has a message that they want to get out,to anywhere in the world.,And I want to illustrate that by telling a couple of stories,about that transformation. 
 I'll start here. Last November there was a presidential election.,You probably read something about it in the papers.,And there was some concern that in some parts of the country,there might be voter suppression.,And so a plan came up to video the vote.,And the idea was that individual citizens,with phones capable of taking photos or making video,would document their polling places,,on the lookout for any kind of voter suppression techniques,,and would upload this to a central place.,And that this would operate as a kind of citizen observation --,that citizens would not be there just to cast individual votes,,but also to help ensure the sanctity of the vote overall. 
 So this is a pattern that assumes we're all in this together.,What matters here,isn't technical capital,,it's social capital.,These tools don't get socially interesting,until they get technologically boring.,It isn't when the shiny new tools show up,that their uses start permeating society.,It's when everybody is able to take them for granted.,Because now that media is increasingly social,,innovation can happen anywhere,that people can take for granted the idea that we're all in this together. 
 And so we're starting to see a media landscape,in which innovation is happening everywhere,,and moving from one spot to another.,That is a huge transformation.,Not to put too fine a point on it, the moment we're living through --,the moment our historical generation is living through --,is the largest increase in expressive capability,in human history.,Now that's a big claim. I'm going to try to back it up. 
 There are only four periods in the last 500 years,where media has changed enough to qualify for the label "revolution.",The first one is the famous one, the printing press:,movable type, oil-based inks, that whole complex of innovations,that made printing possible,and turned Europe upside-down, starting in the middle of the 1400s.,Then, a couple of hundred years ago,,there was innovation in two-way communication,,conversational media: first the telegraph, then the telephone.,Slow, text-based conversations,,then real-time voice based conversations.,Then, about 150 years ago,,there was a revolution in recorded media other than print:,first photos, then recorded sound,,then movies, all encoded onto physical objects.,And finally, about 100 years ago, the harnessing of electromagnetic spectrum,to send sound and images through the air -- radio and television.,This is the media landscape as we knew it in the 20th century.,This is what those of us of a certain age,grew up with, and are used to. 
 But there is a curious asymmetry here.,The media that is good at creating conversations,is no good at creating groups.,And the media that's good at creating groups,is no good at creating conversations.,If you want to have a conversation,in this world, you have it with one other person.,If you want to address a group, you get the same message,and you give it to everybody in the group,,whether you're doing that with a broadcasting tower or a printing press.,That was the media landscape,as we had it in the twentieth century. 
 And this is what changed.,This thing that looks like a peacock hit a windscreen,is Bill Cheswick's map of the Internet.,He traces the edges of the individual networks,and then color codes them.,The Internet is the first medium in history,that has native support for groups,and conversation at the same time.,Whereas the phone gave us the one-to-one pattern,,and television, radio, magazines, books,,gave us the one-to-many pattern,,the Internet gives us the many-to-many pattern.,For the first time,,media is natively good at supporting these kinds of conversations.,That's one of the big changes. 
 The second big change,is that, as all media gets digitized,,the Internet also becomes the mode of carriage,for all other media,,meaning that phone calls migrate to the Internet,,magazines migrate to the Internet, movies migrate to the Internet.,And that means that every medium,is right next door to every other medium.,Put another way,,media is increasingly less just a source of information,,and it is increasingly more a site of coordination,,because groups that see or hear or watch or listen to something,can now gather around and talk to each other as well. 
 And the third big change,is that members of the former audience, as Dan Gilmore calls them,,can now also be producers and not consumers.,Every time a new consumer,joins this media landscape,a new producer joins as well,,because the same equipment --,phones, computers --,let you consume and produce.,It's as if, when you bought a book, they threw in the printing press for free;,it's like you had a phone that could turn into a radio,if you pressed the right buttons.,That is a huge change,in the media landscape we're used to.,And it's not just Internet or no Internet.,We've had the Internet in its public form,for almost 20 years now,,and it's still changing,as the media becomes more social.,It's still changing patterns,even among groups who know how to deal with the Internet well. 
 Second story.,Last May, China in the Sichuan province,had a terrible earthquake, 7.9 magnitude,,massive destruction in a wide area, as the Richter Scale has it.,And the earthquake was reported as it was happening.,People were texting from their phones. They were taking photos of buildings.,They were taking videos of buildings shaking.,They were uploading it to QQ, China's largest Internet service.,They were Twittering it.,And so as the quake was happening,the news was reported.,And because of the social connections,,Chinese students coming elsewhere, and going to school,,or businesses in the rest of the world opening offices in China --,there were people listening all over the world, hearing this news.,The BBC got their first wind of the Chinese quake from Twitter.,Twitter announced the existence of the quake,several minutes before the US Geological Survey,had anything up online for anybody to read.,The last time China had a quake of that magnitude,it took them three months to admit that it had happened. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now they might have liked to have done that here,,rather than seeing these pictures go up online.,But they weren't given that choice,,because their own citizens beat them to the punch.,Even the government learned of the earthquake from their own citizens,,rather than from the Xinhua News Agency.,And this stuff rippled like wildfire.,For a while there,the top 10 most clicked links on Twitter,,the global short messaging service --,nine of the top 10 links were about the quake.,People collating information,,pointing people to news sources,,pointing people to the US geological survey.,The 10th one was kittens on a treadmill, but that's the Internet for you. 
 (Laughter) 
 But nine of the 10 in those first hours.,And within half a day donation sites were up,,and donations were pouring in from all around the world.,This was an incredible, coordinated global response.,And the Chinese then, in one of their periods of media openness,,decided that they were going to let it go,,that they were going to let this citizen reporting fly.,And then this happened.,People began to figure out, in the Sichuan Provence,,that the reason so many school buildings had collapsed --,because tragically the earthquake happened during a school day --,the reason so many school buildings collapsed,is that corrupt officials had taken bribes,to allow those building to be built to less than code.,And so they started, the citizen journalists started 
 reporting that as well. And there was an incredible picture.,You may have seen in on the front page of the New York Times.,A local official literally prostrated himself in the street,,in front of these protesters,,in order to get them to go away.,Essentially to say, "We will do anything to placate you,,just please stop protesting in public." 
 But these are people who have been radicalized,,because, thanks to the one child policy,,they have lost everyone in their next generation.,Someone who has seen the death of a single child,now has nothing to lose.,And so the protest kept going.,And finally the Chinese cracked down.,That was enough of citizen media.,And so they began to arrest the protesters.,They began to shut down the media that the protests were happening on. 
 China is probably the most successful,manager of Internet censorship in the world,,using something that is widely described as the Great Firewall of China.,And the Great Firewall of China,is a set of observation points,that assume that media is produced by professionals,,it mostly comes in from the outside world,,it comes in relatively sparse chunks,,and it comes in relatively slowly.,And because of those four characteristics,they are able to filter it as it comes into the country.,But like the Maginot Line,,the great firewall of China was facing in the wrong direction,for this challenge,,because not one of those four things was true in this environment.,The media was produced locally. It was produced by amateurs.,It was produced quickly. And it was produced at such an incredible abundance,that there was no way to filter it as it appeared.,And so now the Chinese government, who for a dozen years,,has quite successfully filtered the web,,is now in the position of having to decide,whether to allow or shut down entire services,,because the transformation to amateur media,is so enormous that they can't deal with it any other way. 
 And in fact that is happening this week.,On the 20th anniversary of Tiananmen,they just, two days ago, announced,that they were simply shutting down access to Twitter,,because there was no way to filter it other than that.,They had to turn the spigot entirely off.,Now these changes don't just affect people who want to censor messages.,They also affect people who want to send messages, 
 because this is really a transformation of the ecosystem as a whole,,not just a particular strategy.,The classic media problem, from the 20th century,is, how does an organization have a message,that they want to get out,to a group of people distributed at the edges of a network.,And here is the twentieth century answer.,Bundle up the message. Send the same message to everybody.,National message. Targeted individuals.,Relatively sparse number of producers.,Very expensive to do,,so there is not a lot of competition.,This is how you reach people.,All of that is over. 
 We are increasingly in a landscape where media is global,,social, ubiquitous and cheap.,Now most organizations that are trying to send messages,to the outside world, to the distributed collection of the audience,,are now used to this change.,The audience can talk back.,And that's a little freaky. But you can get used to it after a while, as people do. 
 But that's not the really crazy change that we're living in the middle of.,The really crazy change is here:,it's the fact that they are no longer disconnected from each other,,the fact that former consumers are now producers,,the fact that the audience can talk directly to one another;,because there is a lot more amateurs than professionals,,and because the size of the network,,the complexity of the network is actually the square,of the number of participants,,meaning that the network, when it grows large,,grows very, very large. 
 As recently at last decade,,most of the media that was available for public consumption,was produced by professionals.,Those days are over, never to return.,It is the green lines now, that are the source of the free content,,which brings me to my last story.,We saw some of the most imaginative use,of social media during the Obama campaign. 
 And I don't mean most imaginative use in politics --,I mean most imaginative use ever.,And one of the things Obama did, was they famously,,the Obama campaign did, was they famously put up,MyBarackObama.com, myBO.com,And millions of citizens rushed in to participate,,and to try and figure out how to help.,An incredible conversation sprung up there.,And then, this time last year,,Obama announced that he was going to change his vote on FISA,,The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.,He had said, in January, that he would not sign a bill,that granted telecom immunity for possibly warrantless spying,on American persons.,By the summer, in the middle of the general campaign,,He said, "I've thought about the issue more. I've changed my mind.,I'm going to vote for this bill.",And many of his own supporters,on his own site went very publicly berserk. 
 It was Senator Obama when they created it. They changed the name later.,"Please get FISA right.",Within days of this group being created,it was the fastest growing group on myBO.com;,within weeks of its being created it was the largest group.,Obama had to issue a press release.,He had to issue a reply.,And he said essentially, "I have considered the issue.,I understand where you are coming from.,But having considered it all, I'm still going to vote the way I'm going to vote.,But I wanted to reach out to you and say, I understand that you disagree with me,,and I'm going to take my lumps on this one." 
 This didn't please anybody. But then a funny thing happened in the conversation.,People in that group realized,that Obama had never shut them down.,Nobody in the Obama campaign had ever tried to hide the group,or make it harder to join,,to deny its existence, to delete it,,to take to off the site.,They had understood that their role,with myBO.com was to convene their supporters,but not to control their supporters. 
 And that is the kind of discipline,that it takes to make really mature use,of this media.,Media, the media landscape that we knew,,as familiar as it was, as easy conceptually as it was,to deal with the idea that professionals broadcast,messages to amateurs,,is increasingly slipping away.,In a world where media is global, social, ubiquitous and cheap,,in a world of media where the former audience,are now increasingly full participants,,in that world, media is less and less often,about crafting a single message,to be consumed by individuals.,It is more and more often,a way of creating an environment for convening,and supporting groups. 
 And the choice we face,,I mean anybody who has a message they want to have heard,anywhere in the world,,isn't whether or not that is the media environment we want to operate in.,That's the media environment we've got.,The question we all face now is,,"How can we make best use of this media?,Even though it means changing the way we've always done it.",Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Clearly, we're living in a moment of crisis.,Arguably the financial markets have failed us,and the aid system is failing us,,and yet I stand firmly with the optimists,who believe that there has probably never been a more exciting moment to be alive.,Because of some of technologies we've been talking about.,Because of the resources, the skills,,and certainly the surge of talent we're seeing all around the world,,with the mindset to create change.,And we've got a president who sees himself as a global citizen,,who recognizes that no longer is there a single superpower,,but that we've got to engage in a different way with the world. 
 And by definition, every one of you who is in this room,must consider yourself a global soul,,a global citizen.,You work on the front lines. And you've seen the best and the worst,that human beings can do for one another and to one another.,And no matter what country you live or work in,,you've also seen the extraordinary things that individuals are capable of,,even in their most ordinariness. 
 Today there is a raging debate,as to how best we lift people out of poverty,,how best we release their energies.,On the one hand, we have people that say,the aid system is so broken we need to throw it out.,And on the other we have people who say,the problem is that we need more aid.,And what I want to talk about is something that compliments both systems.,We call it patient capital. 
 The critics point to the 500 billion dollars spent,in Africa since 1970,and say, and what do we have but environmental degradation,and incredible levels of poverty, rampant corruption?,They use Mobutu as metaphor.,And their policy prescription is to,make government more accountable,,focus on the capital markets,,invest, don't give anything away. 
 On the other side, as I said, there are those who say,the problem is that we need more money.,That when it comes to the rich, we'll bail out,and we'll hand a lot of aid,,but when it comes to our poor brethren,,we want little to do with it.,They point to the successes of aid:,the eradication of smallpox,,and the distribution of tens of millions,of malaria bed nets and antiretrovirals.,Both sides are right.,And the problem is that neither side is listening to the other.,Even more problematic, they're not listening to,poor people themselves. 
 After 25 years of working on issues of,poverty and innovation,,it's true that there are probably no more market-oriented,individuals on the planet,than low-income people.,They must navigate markets daily,,making micro-decisions, dozens and dozens,,to move their way through society,,and yet if a single catastrophic health problem,impacts their family,,they could be put back into poverty, sometimes for generations.,And so we need both the market,and we need aid. 
 Patient capital works between,,and tries to take the best of both.,It's money that's invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities,and are building solutions,to healthcare, water, housing, alternative energy,,thinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity,,but as individual customers, consumers, clients,,people who want to make decisions in their own lives. 
 Patient capital requires that we have,incredible tolerance for risk,,a long time horizon in terms of allowing those,entrepreneurs time to experiment,,to use the market as the best listening device that we have,,and the expectation of below-market returns,,but outsized social impact.,It recognizes that the market has its limitation,,and so patient capital also works,with smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global economy,to include all people. 
 Now, entrepreneurs need patient capital,for three reasons.,First, they tend to work in markets,where people make one, two, three dollars a day,and they are making all of their decisions within that income level.,Second, the geographies in which they work,have terrible infrastructure --,no roads to speak of, sporadic electricity,and high levels of corruption.,Third, they are often creating markets. 
 Even if you're bringing clean water,for the first time into rural villages, it is something new.,And so many low-income people,have seen so many failed promises broken,and seen so many quacks and sporadic medicines offered to them,that building trust takes a lot of time,,takes a lot of patience.,It also requires being connected to a lot of management assistance.,Not only to build the systems,,the business models that allow us,to reach low income people in a sustainable way,,but to connect those business,to other markets, to governments, to corporations --,real partnerships if we want to get to scale. 
 I want to share one story,about an innovation called drip irrigation.,In 2002 I met this incredible entrepreneur,named Amitabha Sadangi from India,,who'd been working for 20 years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet.,And he was expressing his frustration,that the aid market had bypassed low-income farmers altogether,,despite the fact that 200 million farmers,alone in India make under a dollar a day.,They were creating subsidies,either for large farms,,or they were giving inputs to the farmers,that they thought they should use, rather than,that the farmers wanted to use. 
 At the same time Amitabha was,obsessed with this drip irrigation technology,that had been invented in Israel.,It was a way of bringing small amounts of water,directly to the stalk of the plant.,And it could transform,swaths of desert land into fields of emerald green.,But the market also had bypassed low income farmers,,because these systems were both too expensive,,and they were constructed for fields that were too large.,The average small village farmer,works on two acres or less. 
 And so, Amitabha decided that he would take that innovation,and he would redesign it from the perspective,of the poor farmers themselves,,because he spent so many years listening to what they needed,not what he thought that they should have.,And he used three fundamental principles. 
 The first one was miniaturization.,The drip irrigation system,had to be small enough that a farmer only had,to risk a quarter acre,,even if he had two,,because it was too frightening, given all that he had at stake.,Second, it had to be extremely affordable.,In other words, that risk on the quarter acre,needed to be repaid in a single harvest,,or else they wouldn't take the risk.,And third, it had to be what Amitabha calls,infinitely expandable.,What I mean is with the profits from the first quarter acre,,the farmers could buy a second,and a third and a fourth. 
 As of today, IDE India, Amitabha's organization,,has sold over 300,000 farmers these systems,and has seen their yields and incomes,double or triple on average,,but this didn't happen overnight.,In fact, when you go back to the beginning,,there were no private investors,who would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology,for a market class that made under a dollar a day,,that were known to be some of the most risk-averse people on the planet,and that were working in one of the riskiest sectors, agriculture. 
 And so we needed grants. And he used significant grants,to research, to experiment, to fail,,to innovate and try again.,And when he had a prototype,and had a better understanding of how to market to farmers,,that's when patient capital could come in.,And we helped him build a company, for profit,,that would build on IDE's knowledge,,and start looking at sales and exports,,and be able to tap into other kinds of capital. 
 Secondarily, we wanted to see if we could export,this drip irrigation and bring it into other countries.,And so we met Dr. Sono Khangharani in Pakistan.,And while, again, you needed patience,to move a technology for the poor,in India into Pakistan,,just to get the permits,,over time we were able to start a company,with Dr. Sono, who runs a large,community development organization in the Thar Desert,,which is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country.,And though that company has just started,,our assumption is that there too,we'll see the impact on millions. 
 But drip irrigation isn't the only innovation.,We're starting to see these happening all around the world.,In Arusha, Tanzania, A to Z Textile Manufacturing,has worked in partnership with us,,with UNICEF, with the Global Fund,,to create a factory that now employs 7,000 people, mostly women.,And they produce 20 million lifesaving bednets,for Africans around the world. 
 Lifespring Hospital,is a joint venture between Acumen and the government of India,to bring quality, affordable maternal health care,to low-income women,,and it's been so successful that it's currently building,a new hospital every 35 days. 
 And 1298 Ambulances decided that it was going to,reinvent a completely broken industry,,building an ambulance service in Bombay,that would use the technology of Google Earth,,a sliding scale pricing system,so that all people could have access,,and a severe and public decision,not to engage in any form of corruption.,So that in the terrorist attacks of November,they were the first responder,,and are now beginning to scale, because of partnership.,They've just won four government contracts to build off their 100 ambulances,,and are one of the largest and most effective ambulance companies,in India. 
 This idea of scale is critical.,Because we're starting to see these enterprises,reach hundreds of thousands of people. All of the ones I discussed,have reached at least a quarter million people.,But that's obviously not enough.,And it's where the idea of partnership,becomes so important.,Whether it's by finding those innovations,that can access the capital markets,,government itself, or partner with major corporations,,there is unbelievable opportunity for innovation. 
 President Obama understands that.,He recently authorized the creation of a Social Innovation Fund,to focus on what works in this country,,and look at how we can scale it.,And I would submit that it's time to consider,a global innovation fund,that would find these entrepreneurs around the world,who really have innovations, not only for their country,,but ones that we can use in the developed world as well.,Invest financial assistance, but also management assistance.,And then measure the returns,,both from a financial perspective,and from a social impact perspective. 
 When we think about new approaches to aid,,it's impossible not to talk about Pakistan.,We've had a rocky relationship with that country,and, in all fairness,,the United States has not always been a very reliable partner.,But again I would say that this is our moment,for extraordinary things to happen.,And if we take that notion of a global innovation fund,,we could use this time to invest,not directly in government, though we would have government's blessing,,nor in international experts,,but in the many existing entrepreneurs,and civil society leaders,who already are building wonderful innovations,that are reaching people all across the country. 
 People like Rashani Zafar,,who created one of the largest microfinance banks in the country,,and is a real role model for women inside and outside the country.,And Tasneem Siddiqui, who developed a way,called incremental housing,,where he has moved 40,000 slum dwellers,into safe, affordable community housing.,Educational initiatives like DIL and The Citizen Foundation,that are building schools across the country.,It's not hyperbole,to say that these civil society institutions,and these social entrepreneurs,are building real alternatives to the Taliban. 
 I've invested in Pakistan for over seven years now,,and those of you who've also worked there,can attest that Pakistanis are an incredibly hard working population,,and there is a fierce upward mobility in their very nature. 
 President Kennedy said that,those who make peaceful revolution impossible,make violent revolution inevitable.,I would say that the converse is true.,That these social leaders,who really are looking at innovation,and extending opportunity,to the 70 percent of Pakistanis who make less than two dollars a day,,provide real pathways to hope.,And as we think about how we construct aid for Pakistan,,while we need to strengthen the judiciary,,build greater stability,,we also need to think about lifting those leaders,who can be role models for the rest of the world. 
 On one of my last visits to Pakistan,,I asked Dr. Sono if he would take me,to see some of the drip irrigation in the Thar Desert.,And we left Karachi one morning before dawn.,It was about 115 degrees.,And we drove for eight hours,along this moonscape-like landscape,with very little color, lots of heat,,very little discussion, because we were exhausted. 
 And finally, at the end of the journey,,I could see this thin little yellow line across the horizon.,And as we got closer, its significance became apparent.,That there in the desert,was a field of sunflowers growing seven feet tall.,Because one of the poorest farmers on Earth,had gotten access to a technology,that had allowed him to change his own life.,His name was Raja,,and he had kind, twinkly hazel eyes,and warm expressive hands,that reminded me of my father. 
 And he said it was the first dry season,in his entire life that he hadn't taken,his 12 children and 50 grandchildren,on a two day journey across the desert,to work as day laborers at a commercial farm,for about 50 cents a day.,Because he was building these crops.,And with the money he earned he could stay this year.,And for the first time ever in three generations,,his children would go to school. 
 We asked him if he would send his daughters as well as his sons.,And he said, "Of course I will.,Because I don't want them discriminated against anymore.",When we think about solutions to poverty,,we cannot deny individuals,their fundamental dignity.,Because at the end of the day,,dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth.,And what's exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectors,who are building innovations that recognize,that what people want is freedom,and choice and opportunity.,Because that is where dignity really starts. 
 Martin Luther King said that,love without power is anemic and sentimental,,and that power without love,is reckless and abusive.,Our generation has seen both approaches tried,,and often fail.,But I think our generation also might be the first,to have the courage to embrace both love and power.,For that is what we'll need, as we move forward,to dream and imagine what it will really take,to build a global economy that includes all of us,,and to finally extend that fundamental proposition,that all men are created equal to every human being on the planet. 
 The time for us to begin innovating,and looking for new solutions, a cross sector, is now.,I can only talk from my own experience,,but in eight years of running Acumen fund,,I've seen the power of patient capital.,Not only to inspire innovation and risk taking,,but to truly build systems that have created,more than 25,000 jobs,and delivered tens of millions of services and products,to some of the poorest people on the planet.,I know it works.,But I know that many other kinds of innovation also work. 
 And so I urge you, in whatever sector you work,,in whatever job you do,,to start thinking about how we might,build solutions that start,from the perspective of those we're trying to help.,Rather than what we think that they might need.,It will take embracing the world with both arms.,And it will take living with the spirit of generosity and accountability,,with a sense of integrity and perseverance.,And yet these are the very qualities,for which men and women have been honored,throughout the generations.,And there is so much good that we can do.,Just think of all those sunflowers in the desert.,Thank you.,(Applause)Because of what I'm about to say,,I really should establish my green credentials.,When I was a small boy, I took my pledge,as an American, to save and faithfully defend from waste,the natural resources of my country,,its air, soil and minerals, its forests, waters and wildlife.,And I've stuck to that.,Stanford, I majored in ecology and evolution.,1968, I put out the Whole Earth Catalog. Was "mister natural" for a while. 
 And then worked for the Jerry Brown administration.,The Brown administration, and a bunch of my friends,,basically leveled the energy efficiency of California,,so it's the same now, 30 years later,,even though our economy has gone up 80 percent, per capita.,And we are putting out less greenhouse gasses than any other state.,California is basically the equivalent of Europe, in this. 
 This year, Whole Earth Catalog has a supplement that I'll preview today,,called Whole Earth Discipline.,The dominant demographic event of our time,is this screamingly rapid urbanization,that we have going on.,By mid-century we'll be about 80 percent urban,,and that's mostly in the developing world,,where that's happening.,It's interesting, because history is driven to a large degree,by the size of cities.,The developing world now has all of the biggest cities,,and they are developing three times faster than the developed countries,,and nine times bigger.,It's qualitatively different.,They are the drivers of history, as we see by looking at history. 
 1,000 years ago this is what the world looked like.,Well we now have a distribution of urban power,similar to what we had 1,000 years ago.,In other words, the rise of the West,,dramatic as it was, is over.,The aggregate numbers are absolutely overwhelming:,1.3 million people a week coming to town,,decade after decade.,What's really going on?,Well, what's going on is the villages of the world are emptying out.,Subsistence farming is drying up basically. 
 People are following opportunity into town.,And this is why.,I used to have a very romantic idea about villages,,and it's because I never lived in one.,(Laughter),Because in town --,this is the bustling squatter city,of Kibera, near Nairobi --,they see action. They see opportunity.,They see a cash economy that they were not able to participate in,back in the subsistence farm. 
 As you go around these places there's plenty of aesthetics.,There is plenty going on.,They are poor, but they are intensely urban. And they are intensely creative.,The aggregate numbers now,are that basically squatters,,all one billion of them, are building the urban world,,which means they're building the world --,personally, one by one, family by family,,clan by clan, neighborhood by neighborhood.,They start flimsy and they get substantial as time goes by.,They even build their own infrastructure.,Well, steal their own infrastructure, at first.,Cable TV, water, the whole gamut, all gets stolen.,And then gradually gentrifies. 
 It is not the case that slums undermine prosperity,,not the working slums; they help create prosperity.,So in a town like Mumbai, which is half slums,,it's 1/6th of the GDP of India.,Social capital in the slums is at its most urban and dense.,These people are valuable as a group.,And that's how they work. 
 There is a lot of people who think about all these poor people,,"Oh there's terrible things. We've got to fix their housing.",It used to be, "Oh we've got to get them phone service.",Now they're showing us how they do their phone service.,Famine mostly is a rural event now.,There are things they care about.,And this is where we can help.,And the nations they're in can help.,And they are helping each other solve these issues. 
 And you go to a nice dense place like this slum in Mumbai.,You look at that lane on the right.,And you can ask, "Okay what's going on there?",The answer is, "Everything.",This is better than a mall. It's much denser.,It's much more interactive.,And the scale is terrific.,The main event is, these are not people crushed by poverty.,These are people busy getting out of poverty,just as fast as they can.,They're helping each other do it.,They're doing it through an outlaw thing,,the informal economy.,The informal economy, it's sort of like dark energy in astrophysics:,it's not supposed to be there, but it's huge.,We don't understand how it works yet, but we have to. 
 Furthermore, people in the informal economy,,the gray economy --,as time goes by,,crime is happening around them. And they can join the criminal world,,or they can join the legitimate world.,We should be able to make that choice,easier for them to get toward the legitimate world,,because if we don't, they will go toward the criminal world.,There's all kinds of activity. 
 In Dharavi the slum performs not only,a lot of services for itself,,but it performs services for the city at large.,And one of the main events are these ad-hoc schools.,Parents pool their money to hire some local teachers,to a private, tiny, unofficial school.,Education is more possible in the cities, and that changes the world.,So you see some interesting, typical, urban things. 
 So one thing slammed up against another,,such as in Sao Paulo here.,That's what cities do. That's how they create value,,is by slamming things together.,In this case, supply right next to demand.,So the maids and the gardeners and the guards,that live in this lively part of town on the left,walk to work, in the boring, rich neighborhood. 
 Proximity is amazing.,We are learning about how dense proximity can be.,Connectivity between the city and the country,is what's going to keep the country good,,because the city has interesting ways of doing things.,This is what makes cities --,(Applause),this is what makes cities so green in the developing world. 
 Because people leave the poverty trap, an ecological disaster,of subsistence farms, and head to town.,And when they're gone the natural environment,starts to come back very rapidly.,And those who remain in the village can shift over to cash crops,to send food to the new growing markets in town.,So if you want to save a village, you do it with a good road,,or with a good cell phone connection, and ideally some grid electrical power. 
 So the event is: we're a city planet. That just happened.,More than half.,The numbers are considerable. A billion live in the squatter cities now.,Another billion is expected.,That's more than a sixth of humanity living a certain way.,And that will determine a lot of how we function. 
 Now, for us environmentalists,,maybe the greenest thing about the cities is they diffuse the population bomb.,People get into town.,The immediately have fewer children.,They don't even have to get rich yet. Just the opportunity of,coming up in the world means they will have fewer, higher-quality kids,,and the birthrate goes down radically. 
 Very interesting side effect here,,here's a slide from Phillip Longman.,Shows what is happening.,As we have more and more old people, like me,,and fewer and fewer babies.,And they are regionally separated.,What you're getting is a world which is,old folks, and old cities, going around doing things the old way,,in the north.,And young people in brand new cities they're inventing,,doing new things, in the south.,Where do you think the action is going to be? 
 Shift of subject. Quickly drop by climate.,The climate news, I'm sorry to say, is going to keep getting worse,than we think, faster than we think.,Climate is a profoundly complex, nonlinear system,,full of runaway positive feedbacks,,hidden thresholds and irrevocable tipping points.,Here's just a few samples.,We're going to keep being surprised. And almost all,the surprises are going to be bad ones. 
 From your standpoint this means,a great increase in climate refugees,over the coming decades,,and what goes along with that, which is resource wars,and chaos wars,,as we're seeing in Darfur.,That's what drought does.,It brings carrying capacity down,,and there's not enough carrying capacity,to support the people. And then you're in trouble. 
 Shift to the power situation.,Baseload electricity is what it takes to run a city,,or a city planet.,So far there is only three sources of baseload electricity:,coal, some gas,,nuclear and hydro.,Of those, only nuclear and hydro are green.,Coal is what is causing the climate problems.,And everyone will keep burning it,because it's so cheap, until governments make it expensive.,Wind and solar can't help, because so far we don't have a way to store that energy. 
 So with hydro maxed out,,coal and lose the climate,,or nuclear, which is the current operating low-carbon source,,and maybe save the climate.,And if we can eventually get good solar in space,,that also could help.,Because remember, this is what drives the prosperity in the developing world,in the villages and in the cities. 
 So, between coal and nuclear,,compare their waste products.,If all of the electricity you used in your lifetime was nuclear,,the amount of waste that would be added up,would fit in a Coke can.,Whereas a coal-burning plant,,a normal one gigawatt coal plant, burns 80 rail cars of coal a day,,each car having 100 tons.,And it puts 18 thousand tons,of carbon dioxide in the air.,So and then when you compare the lifetime emissions,of these various energy forms,,nuclear is about even with solar and wind,,and ahead of solar --,oh, I'm sorry -- with hydro and wind, and ahead of solar. 
 And does nuclear really compete with coal?,Just ask the coal miners in Australia.,That's where you see some of the source,,not from my fellow environmentalists,,but from people who feel threatened by nuclear power.,Well the good news is that,the developing world, but frankly, the whole world,,is busy building, and starting to build, nuclear reactors.,This is good for the atmosphere.,It's good for their prosperity. 
 I want to point out one interesting thing,,which is that environmentalists like the thing we call micropower.,It's supposed to be, I don't know, local solar and wind and cogeneration,,and good things like that.,But frankly micro-reactors which are just now coming on,,might serve even better. 
 The Russians, who started this, are building floating reactors,,for their new passage, where the ice is melting, north of Russia.,And they're selling these floating reactors,,only 35 megawatts, to developing countries.,Here's the design of an early one from Toshiba.,It's interesting, say, to take a 25-megawatt,,25 million watts,,and you compare it to the standard big iron,of an ordinary Westinghouse or Ariva,,which is 1.2, 1.6 billion watts.,These things are way smaller. They're much more adaptable.,Here's an American design from Lawrence Livermore Lab.,Here's another American design that came out,of Los Alamos, and is now commercial. 
 Almost all of these are not only small, they are proliferation-proof.,They're typically buried in the ground.,And the innovation is moving very rapidly.,So I think microreactors is going to be important for the future.,In terms of proliferation,,nuclear energy has done more,to dismantle nuclear weapons than any other activity.,And that's why 10 percent of the electricity in this room,,20 percent of electricity,in this room is probably nuclear.,Half of that is coming from dismantled warheads from Russia,,soon to be joined by our dismantled warheads.,And so I would like to see the GNEP program,,that was developed in the Bush administration, go forward aggressively.,And I was glad to see that president Obama,supported the nuclear fuel bank strategy,when he spoke in Prague the other week. 
 One more subject. Genetically engineered food crops,,in my view, as a biologist,,have no reason to be controversial.,My fellow environmentalists, on this subject,,have been irrational, anti-scientific, and very harmful.,Despite their best efforts,,genetically engineered crops are the most,rapidly successful agricultural innovation in history.,They're good for the environment because they enable no-till farming,,which leaves the soil in place,,getting healthier from year to year --,slso keeps less carbon dioxide going from the soil,into the atmosphere.,They reduce pesticide use.,And they increase yield, which allows you to have your,agricultural area be smaller,,and therefore more wild area is freed up. 
 By the way, this map from 2006,is out of date because it shows Africa,still under the thumb of Greenpeace,,and Friends of the Earth from Europe,,and they're finally getting out from under that.,And biotech is moving rapidly in Africa, at last. 
 This is a moral issue.,The Nuffield Council on Bioethics,met on this issue twice in great detail,and said it is a moral imperative,to make genetically engineered crops readily available.,Speaking of imperatives, geoengineering is taboo now,,especially in government circles,,though I think there was a DARPA meeting on it a couple of weeks ago,,but it will be on your plate --,not this year but pretty soon,,because some harsh realizations are coming along.,This is a list of them. 
 Basically the news is going to keep getting more scary.,There will be events,,like 35,000 people dying of a heat wave,,which happened a while back.,Like cyclones coming up toward Bangladesh.,Like wars over water,,such as in the Indus.,And as those events keep happening,we're going to say, "Okay, what can we do about that really?" 
 But there's this little problem with geoengineering:,what body is going to decide,who gets to engineer? How much they do? Where they do it?,Because everybody is downstream,,downwind of whatever is done.,And if we just taboo it completely,we could lose civilization.,But if we just say "OK,,China, you're worried, you go ahead.,You geoengineer your way. We'll geoengineer our way.",That would be considered an act of war by both nations.,So this is very interesting diplomacy coming along.,I should say, it is more practical than people think. 
 Here is an example that climatologists like a lot,,one of the dozens of geoengineering ideas.,This one came from the sulfur dioxide,from Mount Pinatubo in 1991 --,cooled the earth by half a degree.,There was so much ice in 1992, the following year,,that there was a bumper crop of polar bear cubs,who were known as the Pinatubo cubs.,To put sulfur dioxide in the stratosphere,would cost on the order of a billion dollars a year.,That's nothing, compared to all of the other,things we may be trying to do about energy. 
 Just to run by another one:,this is a plan to brighten the reflectance of ocean clouds,,by atomizing seawater;,that would brighten the albedo of the whole planet.,A nice one, because it can happen,lots of little ways in lots of little places,,is by copying the ancient Amazon Indians,who made good agricultural soil,by pyrolizing, smoldering, plant waste,,and biochar fixes large quantities of carbon,while it's improving the soil. 
 So here is where we are.,Nobel Prize-winning climatologist Paul Crutzen,calls our geological era the Anthropocene,,the human-dominated era. We are stuck,with its obligations.,In the Whole Earth Catalog, my first words were,,"We are as Gods, and might as well get good at it.",The first words of Whole Earth Discipline,are, "We are as Gods, and have to get good at it.",Thank you.,(Applause)I'm going to talk about your mindset.,Does your mindset correspond to my dataset?,(Laughter),If not, one or the other needs upgrading, isn't it? 
 When I talk to my students about global issues,,and I listen to them in the coffee break,,they always talk about "we" and "them.",And when they come back into the lecture room,I ask them, "What do you mean with "we" and "them"?,"Oh, it's very easy. It's the western world and it's the developing world," they say.,"We learned it in college.",And what is the definition then? "The definition?,Everyone knows," they say. 
 But then you know, I press them like this.,So one girl said, very cleverly, "It's very easy.,Western world is a long life in a small family.,Developing world is a short life in a large family.",And I like that definition, because it enabled me,to transfer their mindset,into the dataset.,And here you have the dataset.,So, you can see that what we have on this axis here,is size of family. One, two, three, four, five,children per woman on this axis.,And here, length of life, life expectancy,,30, 40, 50.,Exactly what the students said was their concept about the world. 
 And really this is about the bedroom.,Whether the man and woman decide to have small family,,and take care of their kids, and how long they will live.,It's about the bathroom and the kitchen. If you have soap, water and food, you know,,you can live long.,And the students were right. It wasn't that the world consisted --,the world consisted here, of one set of countries over here,,which had large families and short life. Developing world.,And we had one set of countries up there,which was the western world.,They had small families and long life. 
 And you are going to see here,the amazing thing that has happened in the world during my lifetime.,Then the developing countries applied,soap and water, vaccination.,And all the developing world started to apply family planning.,And partly to USA who help to provide,technical advice and investment.,And you see all the world moves over to a two child family,,and a life with 60 to 70 years. 
 But some countries remain back in this area here.,And you can see we still have Afghanistan down here.,We have Liberia. We have Congo.,So we have countries living there.,So the problem I had,is that the worldview that my students had,corresponds to reality in the world,the year their teachers were born.,(Laughter),(Applause) 
 And we, in fact, when we have played this over the world.,I was at the Global Health Conference here in Washington last week,,and I could see the wrong concept,even active people in United States had,,that they didn't realize the improvement,of Mexico there, and China, in relation to United States.,Look here when I move them forward.,Here we go.,They catch up. There's Mexico.,It's on par with United States in these two social dimensions.,There was less than five percent,of the specialists in Global Health that was aware of this.,This great nation, Mexico,,has the problem that arms are coming from North,,across the borders, so they had to stop that,,because they have this strange relationship to the United States, you know. 
 But if I would change this axis here,,I would instead put income per person.,Income per person. I can put that here.,And we will then see,a completely different picture.,By the way, I'm teaching you,how to use our website, Gapminder World,,while I'm correcting this,,because this is a free utility on the net.,And when I now finally got it right,,I can go back 200 years in history.,And I can find United States up there.,And I can let the other countries be shown.,And now I have income per person on this axis.,And United States only had some, one, two thousand dollars at that time.,And the life expectancy was 35 to 40 years,,on par with Afghanistan today. 
 And what has happened in the world, I will show now.,This is instead of studying history,for one year at university.,You can watch me for one minute now and you'll see the whole thing.,(Laughter),You can see how the brown bubbles, which is west Europe,,and the yellow one, which is the United States,,they get richer and richer and also,start to get healthier and healthier.,And this is now 100 years ago,,where the rest of the world remains behind.,Here we come. And that was the influenza.,That's why we are so scared about flu, isn't it?,It's still remembered. The fall of life expectancy.,And then we come up. Not until,independence started. 
 Look here You have China over there,,you have India over there,,and this is what has happened.,Did you note there, that we have Mexico up there?,Mexico is not at all on par with the United States,,but they are quite close.,And especially, it's interesting to see,China and the United States,during 200 years,,because I have my oldest son now working for Google,,after Google acquired this software.,Because in fact, this is child labor. My son and his wife sat in a closet,for many years and developed this.,And my youngest son, who studied Chinese in Beijing.,So they come in with the two perspectives I have, you know?,And my son, youngest son who studied in Beijing,,in China, he got a long-term perspective.,Whereas when my oldest son, who works for Google,,he should develop by quarter, or by half-year.,Or Google is quite generous, so he can have one or two years to go. 
 But in China they look generation after generation,because they remember,the very embarrassing period, for 100 years,,when they went backwards.,And then they would remember the first part,of last century, which was really bad,,and we could go by this so-called Great Leap Forward.,But this was 1963.,Mao Tse-Tung eventually brought health to China,,and then he died, and then Deng Xiaoping started,this amazing move forward. 
 Isn't it strange to see that the United States,first grew the economy, and then gradually got rich?,Whereas China could get healthy much earlier,,because they applied the knowledge of education, nutrition,,and then also benefits of penicillin,and vaccines and family planning.,And Asia could have social development,before they got the economic development.,So to me, as a public health professor,,it's not strange that all these countries grow so fast now. 
 Because what you see here, what you see here,is the flat world of Thomas Friedman,,isn't it.,It's not really, really flat.,But the middle income countries --,and this is where I suggest to my students,,stop using the concept "developing world.",Because after all, talking about the developing world,is like having two chapters in the history of the United States. 
 The last chapter is about present, and president Obama,,and the other is about the past,,where you cover everything from Washington,to Eisenhower.,Because Washington to Eisenhower,,that is what we find in the developing world.,We could actually go to Mayflower,to Eisenhower,,and that would be put together into a developing world,,which is rightly growing its cities in a very amazing way,,which have great entrepreneurs,,but also have the collapsing countries. 
 So, how could we make better sense about this?,Well, one way of trying is to see whether we could,look at income distribution.,This is the income distribution of peoples in the world,,from $1. This is where you have food to eat.,These people go to bed hungry.,And this is the number of people.,This is $10, whether you have a public or a private,health service system. This is where you can,provide health service for your family and school for your children,,and this is OECD countries:,Green, Latin America, East Europe.,This is East Asia, and the light blue there is South Asia. 
 And this is how the world changed.,It changed like this.,Can you see how it's growing? And how hundreds of millions,and billions is coming out of poverty in Asia?,And it goes over here?,And I come now, into projections,,but I have to stop at the door of Lehman Brothers there, you know, because --,(Laughter),that's where the projections are not valid any longer.,Probably the world will do this.,and then it will continue forward like this.,But more or less, this is what will happen,,and we have a world which cannot be looked upon as divided. 
 We have the high income countries here,,with the United States as a leading power;,we have the emerging economies in the middle,,which provide a lot of the funding for the bailout;,and we have the low income countries here.,Yeah, this is a fact that from where the money comes,,they have been saving, you know, over the last decade.,And here we have the low income countries,where entrepreneurs are.,And here we have the countries in collapse and war,,like Afghanistan, Somalia, parts of Congo, Darfur.,We have all this at the same time. 
 That's why it's so problematic to describe what has happened,in the developing world.,Because it's so different, what has happened there.,And that's why I suggest,a slightly different approach of what you would call it.,And you have huge differences within countries also.,I heard that your departments here were by regions.,Here you have Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia,,East Asia, Arab states,,East Europe, Latin America, and OECD.,And on this axis, GDP.,And on this, heath, child survival,,and it doesn't come as a surprise,that Africa south of Sahara is at the bottom. 
 But when I split it, when I split it,into country bubbles,,the size of the bubbles here is the population.,Then you see Sierra Leone and Mauritius, completely different.,There is such a difference within Sub-Saharan Africa.,And I can split the others. Here is the South Asian,,Arab world.,Now all your different departments.,East Europe, Latin America, and OECD countries.,And here were are. We have a continuum in the world.,We cannot put it into two parts. 
 It is Mayflower down here. It is Washington here,,building, building countries.,It's Lincoln here, advancing them.,It's Eisenhower bringing modernity into the countries.,And then it's United States today, up here.,And we have countries all this way.,Now, this is the important thing,of understanding how the world has changed.,At this point I decided to make a pause.,(Laughter) 
 And it is my task, on behalf of the rest of the world,,to convey a thanks to the U.S. taxpayers,,for Demographic Health Survey.,Many are not aware of -- no, this is not a joke.,This is very serious.,It is due to USA's continuous sponsoring,during 25 years of the very good methodology,for measuring child mortality,that we have a grasp of what's happening in the world.,(Applause),And it is U.S. government at its best,,without advocacy, providing facts,,that it's useful for the society.,And providing data free of charge,on the internet, for the world to use. Thank you very much. 
 Quite the opposite of the World Bank,,who compiled data with government money,,tax money, and then they sell it to add a little profit,,in a very inefficient, Gutenberg way.,(Applause),But the people doing that at the World Bank,are among the best in the world.,And they are highly skilled professionals.,It's just that we would like to upgrade our international agencies,to deal with the world in the modern way, as we do.,And when it comes to free data and transparency,,United States of America is one of the best.,And that doesn't come easy from the mouth of a Swedish public health professor.,(Laughter),And I'm not paid to come here, no. 
 I would like to show you what happens with the data,,what we can show with this data.,Look here. This is the world.,With income down there and child mortality.,And what has happened in the world?,Since 1950, during the last 50 years,we have had a fall in child mortality.,And it is the DHS that makes it possible to know this.,And we had an increase in income.,And the blue former developing countries,are mixing up with the former industrialized western world.,We have a continuum. But we still have, of course,,Congo, up there. We still have as poor countries,as we have had, always, in history.,And that's the bottom billion, where we've heard today,about a completely new approach to do it. 
 And how fast has this happened?,Well, MDG 4.,The United States has not been so eager,to use MDG 4.,But you have been the main sponsor that has enabled us to measure it,,because it's the only child mortality that we can measure.,And we used to say that it should fall four percent per year.,Let's see what Sweden has done.,We used to boast about fast social progress.,That's where we were, 1900.,1900, Sweden was there.,Same child mortality as Bangladesh had, 1990,,though they had lower income.,They started very well. They used the aid well.,They vaccinated the kids. They get better water.,And they reduced child mortality,,with an amazing 4.7 percent per year. They beat Sweden.,I run Sweden the same 16 year period. 
 Second round, it's Sweden, 1916,,against Egypt, 1990.,Here we go. Once again the USA is part of the reason here.,They get safe water, they get food for the poor,,and they get malaria eradicated.,5.5 percent. They are faster than the millennium development goal. 
 And third chance for Sweden, against Brazil here.,Brazil here has amazing social improvement,over the last 16 years,,and they go faster than Sweden.,This means that the world is converging.,The middle income countries,,the emerging economy, they are catching up.,They are moving to cities,,where they also get better assistance for that. 
 Well the Swedish students protest at this point.,They say, "This is not fair,,because these countries had vaccines and antibiotics,that were not available for Sweden.,We have to do real-time competition.",Okay. I give you Singapore, the year I was born.,Singapore had twice the child mortality of Sweden.,It's the most tropical country in the world,,a marshland on the equator.,And here we go. It took a little time for them to get independent.,But then they started to grow their economy.,And they made the social investment. They got away malaria.,They got a magnificent health system,that beat both the U.S. and Sweden.,We never thought it would happen that they would win over Sweden!,(Applause) 
 All these green countries are achieving millennium development goals.,These yellow are just about to be doing this.,These red are the countries that doesn't do it, and the policy has to be improved.,Not simplistic extrapolation.,We have to really find a way,of supporting those countries in a better way.,We have to respect the middle income countries,on what they are doing.,And we have to fact-base the whole way we look at the world. 
 This is dollar per person. This is HIV in the countries.,The blue is Africa.,The size of the bubbles is how many are HIV affected.,You see the tragedy in South Africa there.,About 20 percent of the adult population are infected.,And in spite of them having quite a high income,,they have a huge number of HIV infected.,But you also see that there are African countries down here.,There is no such thing as an HIV epidemic in Africa.,There's a number, five to 10 countries in Africa,that has the same level as Sweden and United States.,And there are others who are extremely high. 
 And I will show you that what has happened,in one of the best countries, with the most vibrant economy,in Africa and a good governance, Botswana.,They have a very high level. It's coming down.,But now it's not falling,,because there, with help from PEPFAR,,it's working with treatment. And people are not dying.,And you can see it's not that easy,,that it is war which caused this.,Because here, in Congo, there is war.,And here, in Zambia, there is peace. 
 And it's not the economy. Richer country has a little higher.,If I split Tanzania in its income,,the richer 20 percent in Tanzania,has more HIV than the poorest one.,And it's really different within each country.,Look at the provinces of Kenya. They are very different.,And this is the situation you see.,It's not deep poverty. It's the special situation,,probably of concurrent sexual partnership,among part of the heterosexual population,in some countries, or some parts of countries,,in south and eastern Africa. 
 Don't make it Africa. Don't make it a race issue.,Make it a local issue. And do prevention at each place,,in the way it can be done there.,So to just end up,,there are things of suffering,in the one billion poorest, which we don't know.,Those who live beyond the cellphone,,those who have yet to see a computer,,those who have no electricity at home. 
 This is the disease, Konzo, I spent 20 years,elucidating in Africa.,It's caused by fast processing of toxic cassava root in famine situation.,It's similar to the pellagra epidemic in Mississippi in the '30s.,It's similar to other nutritional diseases.,It will never affect a rich person. 
 We have seen it here in Mozambique.,This is the epidemic in Mozambique. This is an epidemic in northern Tanzania.,You never heard about the disease.,But it's much more than Ebola,that has been affected by this disease.,Cause crippling throughout the world.,And over the last two years,,2,000 people has been crippled,in the southern tip of Bandundu region.,That used to be the illegal diamond trade,,from the UNITA-dominated area in Angola.,That has now disappeared,,and they are now in great economic problem.,And one week ago, for the first time,,there were four lines on the Internet. 
 Don't get confused of the progress of the emerging economies,and the great capacity,of people in the middle income countries,and in peaceful low income countries.,There is still mystery in one billion.,And we have to have more concepts,than just developing countries and developing world.,We need a new mindset. The world is converging,,but -- but -- but not the bottom billion.,They are still as poor as they've ever been.,It's not sustainable, and it will not happen around one superpower.,But you will remain,one of the most important superpowers,,and the most hopeful superpower, for the time to be.,And this institution,will have a very crucial role,,not for United States, but for the world.,So you have a very bad name,,State Department. This is not the State Department.,It's the World Department.,And we have a high hope in you. Thank you very much.,(Applause)I'm going to talk about post-conflict recovery,and how we might do post-conflict recovery better.,The record on post-conflict recovery is not very impressive.,40 percent of all post-conflict situations,,historically, have reverted back to conflict within a decade.,In fact, they've accounted for half of all civil wars.,Why has the record been so poor?,Well, the conventional approach,to post-conflict situations,has rested on, on kind of, three principles. 
 The first principle is: it's the politics that matters.,So, the first thing that is prioritized is politics.,Try and build a political settlement first.,And then the second step is to say,,"The situation is admittedly dangerous, but only for a short time.",So get peacekeepers there, but get them home as soon as possible.,So, short-term peacekeepers.,And thirdly, what is the exit strategy for the peacekeepers?,It's an election.,That will produce a legitimate and accountable government. 
 So that's the conventional approach.,I think that approach denies reality.,We see that there is no quick fix.,There's certainly no quick security fix.,I've tried to look at the risks of reversion to conflict,,during our post-conflict decade.,And the risks stay high throughout the decade.,And they stay high regardless of the political innovations.,Does an election produce an accountable and legitimate government?,What an election produces is a winner and a loser.,And the loser is unreconciled.,The reality is that we need to reverse the sequence.,It's not the politics first;,it's actually the politics last.,The politics become easier as the decade progresses,if you're building on a foundation,of security and economic development --,the rebuilding of prosperity. 
 Why does the politics get easier?,And why is it so difficult initially?,Because after years of stagnation and decline,,the mentality of politics is that it's a zero-sum game.,If the reality is stagnation,,I can only go up if you go down.,And that doesn't produce a productive politics.,And so the mentality has to shift from,zero-sum to positive-sum,before you can get a productive politics.,You can only get positive, that mental shift,,if the reality is that prosperity is being built.,And in order to build prosperity, we need security in place.,So that is what you get when you face reality.,But the objective of facing reality,is to change reality. 
 And so now let me suggest,two complimentary approaches,to changing the reality of the situations.,The first is to recognize the interdependence,of three key actors, who are different actors,,and at the moment are uncoordinated.,The first actor is the Security Council.,The Security Council typically has the responsibility,for providing the peacekeepers,who build the security.,And that needs to be recognized,,first of all, that peacekeeping works.,It is a cost-effective approach.,It does increase security.,But it needs to be done long-term.,It needs to be a decade-long approach,,rather than just a couple of years.,That's one actor, the Security Council. 
 The second actor, different cast of guys,,is the donors.,The donors provide post-conflict aid.,Typically in the past,,the donors have been interested in the first couple of years,,and then they got bored.,They moved on to some other situation.,Post-conflict economic recovery,is a slow process.,There are no quick processes in economics,except decline.,You can do that quite fast.,(Laughter),So the donors have to stick with this situation,for at least a decade. 
 And then the third key actor,is the post-conflict government.,And there are two key things it's got to do.,One is it's got to do economic reform,,not fuss about the political constitution.,It's got to reform economic policy.,Why? Because during conflict,economic policy typically deteriorates.,Governments snatch short-term opportunities,and, by the end of the conflict, the chickens have come home to roost. 
 So this legacy of conflict is really bad economic policy.,So there is a reform agenda, and there is an inclusion agenda.,The inclusion agenda doesn't come from elections.,Elections produce a loser, who is then excluded.,So the inclusion agenda means genuinely,bringing people inside the tent.,So those three actors.,And they are interdependent,over a long term.,If the Security Council doesn't commit to security,over the course of a decade,,you don't get the reassurance which produces private investment.,If you don't get the policy reform and the aid,,you don't get the economic recovery,,which is the true exit strategy for the peacekeepers.,So we should recognize that interdependence,,by formal, mutual commitments.,The United Nations actually has a language,for these mutual commitments, the recognition of mutual commitments;,it's called the language of compact.,And so we need a post-conflict compact.,The United Nations even has an agency which could broker these compacts;,it's called the Peace Building Commission. 
 It would be ideal to have a standard set of norms,where, when we got to a post-conflict situation,,there was an expectation of these mutual commitments,from the three parties.,So that's idea one:,recognize interdependence.,And now let me turn to the second approach, which is complimentary.,And that is to focus on a few critical objectives.,Typical post-conflict situation is a zoo,of different actors with different priorities.,And indeed, unfortunately, if you navigate by needs,you get a very unfocused agenda,,because in these situations, needs are everywhere,,but the capacity to implement change is very limited.,So we have to be disciplined and focus on things that are critical. 
 And I want to suggest that in the typical post-conflict situation,three things are critical.,One is jobs.,One is improvements in basic services --,especially health, which is a disaster during conflict.,So jobs, health, and clean government.,Those are the three critical priorities.,So I'm going to talk a little about each of them. 
 Jobs.,What is a distinctive approach,to generating jobs in post-conflict situations?,And why are jobs so important?,Jobs for whom? Especially jobs for young men.,In post-conflict situations,,the reason that they so often revert to conflict,,is not because elderly women get upset.,It's because young men get upset.,And why are they upset? Because they have nothing to do.,And so we need a process of generating jobs,,for ordinary young men, fast.,Now, that is difficult.,Governments in post-conflict situation,often respond by puffing up the civil service.,That is not a good idea.,It's not sustainable.,In fact, you're building a long-term liability,by inflating civil service.,But getting the private sector to expand is also difficult,,because any activity which is open to international trade,is basically going to be uncompetitive,in a post-conflict situation.,These are not environments where you can build export manufacturing. 
 There's one sector which isn't exposed to international trade,,and which can generate a lot of jobs,,and which is, in any case, a sensible sector,to expand, post-conflict,,and that is the construction sector.,The construction sector has a vital role,,obviously, in reconstruction.,But typically that sector has withered away during conflict.,During conflict people are doing destruction.,There isn't any construction going on. And so the sector shrivels away.,And then when you try and expand it,,because it's shriveled away,,you encounter a lot of bottlenecks.,Basically, prices soar,and crooked politicians then milk the rents from the sector,,but it doesn't generate any jobs.,And so the policy priority is to break the bottlenecks,in expanding the construction sector. 
 What might the bottlenecks be?,Just think what you have to do,successfully to build a structure, using a lot of labor.,First you need access to land.,Often the legal system is broken down,so you can't even get access to land.,Secondly you need skills,,the mundane skills of the construction sector.,In post-conflict situations we don't just need Doctors Without Borders,,we need Bricklayers Without Borders,,to rebuild the skill set.,We need firms. The firms have gone away.,So we need to encourage the growth of local firms.,If we do that, we not only get the jobs,,we get the improvements in public infrastructure,,the restoration of public infrastructure. 
 Let me turn from jobs to the second objective,,which is improving basic social services.,And to date, there has been a sort of a schizophrenia,in the donor community,,as to how to build basic services,in post-conflict sectors.,On the one hand it pays lip service,to the idea of rebuild an effective state,in the image of Scandinavia in the 1950s.,Lets develop line ministries of this, that, and the other,,that deliver these services.,And it's schizophrenic because in their hearts,donors know that's not a realistic agenda,,and so what they also do is the total bypass:,just fund NGOs. 
 Neither of those approaches is sensible.,And so what I'd suggest,is what I call Independent Service Authorities.,It's to split the functions of a monopoly line ministry up into three.,The planning function and policy function stays with the ministry;,the delivery of services on the ground,,you should use whatever works --,churches, NGOs, local communities,,whatever works.,And in between, there should be a public agency,,the Independent Service Authority,,which channels public money,,and especially donor money,,to the retail providers.,So the NGOs become part of a public government system,,rather than independent of it. 
 One advantage of that is that you can allocate money coherently.,Another is, you can make NGOs accountable.,You can use yardstick competition,,so they have to compete against each other,for the resources.,The good NGOs, like Oxfam, are very keen on this idea.,They want to have the discipline and accountability.,So that's a way to get basic services scaled up.,And because the government would be funding it,,it would be co-branding these services.,So they wouldn't be provided thanks to,the United States government and some NGO.,They would be co-branded,as being done by the post-conflict government, in the country.,So, jobs, basic services, finally, clean government. 
 Clean means follow their money.,The typical post-conflict government is so short of money,that it needs our money,just to be on a life-support system.,You can't get the basic functions of the state done,unless we put money into the core budget of these countries.,But, if we put money into the core budget,,we know that there aren't the budget systems with integrity,that mean that money will be well spent.,And if all we do is put money in and close our eyes,it's not just that the money is wasted --,that's the least of the problems --,it's that the money is captured.,It's captured by the crooks who are at the heart of the political problem.,And so inadvertently we empower the people who are the problem. 
 So building clean government means, yes, provide money,to the budget,,but also provide a lot of scrutiny,,which means a lot of technical assistance that follows the money.,Paddy Ashdown, who was the grand high nabob of Bosnia,to the United Nations,,in his book about his experience, he said,,"I realize what I needed,was accountants without borders,,to follow that money.",So that's the -- let me wrap up,,this is the package. 
 What's the goal?,If we follow this, what would we hope to achieve?,That after 10 years,,the focus on the construction sector,would have produced both jobs,and, hence, security --,because young people would have jobs --,and it would have reconstructed the infrastructure.,So that's the focus on the construction sector.,The focus on the basic service delivery,through these independent service authorities,would have rescued basic services,from their catastrophic levels,,and it would have given ordinary people,the sense that the government was doing something useful.,The emphasis on clean government,would have gradually squeezed out the political crooks,,because there wouldn't be any money,in taking part in the politics.,And so gradually the selection,,the composition of politicians,,would shift from the crooked to the honest.,Where would that leave us?,Gradually it would shift,from a politics of plunder,to a politics of hope. Thank you.,(Applause)I'd like to ask you,,what do these three people have in common?,Well, you probably recognize the first person.,I'm sure you're all avid "American Idol" watchers.,But you might not recognize Aydah Al Jahani,,who is a contestant, indeed a finalist,,in the Poet of the Millions competition,,which is broadcast out of Abu Dhabi,,and seen throughout the Arab world.,In this contest,people have to write and recite,original poetry, in the Nabati form of poetry,,which is the traditional Bedouin form.,And Lima Sahar was a finalist,in the Afghan Star singing competition. 
 Now, before I go any further,,yes, I know it all began with "Britain's Got Talent.",But my point in discussing this,is to show you -- I hope I'll be able to show you,how these merit-based competitions,,with equal access to everyone,,with the winner selected via voting by SMS,,are changing tribal societies.,And I'm going to focus on Afghanistan,and the Arab world with the UAE,,how they're changing tribal societies,,not by introducing Western ideas,,but by being integrated into the language in those places. 
 It all begins with enjoyment.,Video: We are late to watch "Afghan Star.",We are going to watch "Afghan Star." We are late.,We are running late.,We must go to watch "Afghan Star.",Cynthia Schneider: These programs are reaching incredibly deeply into society.,In Afghanistan, people go to extraordinary lengths,to be able to watch this program.,And you don't necessarily have to have your own TV set.,People watch it all over the country,also in public places.,But it goes beyond watching,,because also, part of this,is campaigning.,People become so engaged,that they have volunteers, just like political volunteers anyway,,who fan out over the countryside,,campaigning for their candidate.,Contestants also put themselves forward. 
 Now, of course there is a certain degree of ethnic allegiance, but not entirely.,Because each year the winner has come from a different tribal group.,This has opened up the door,,particularly for women.,And in the last season there were two women in the finalists.,One of them, Lima Sahar, is a Pashtun from Kandahar,,a very conservative part of the country.,And here she relates, in the documentary film "Afghan Star,",how her friends urged her not to do this,and told her that she was leaving them for democracy.,But she also confides that,she knows that members of the Taliban,are actually SMS-ing votes in for her. 
 Aydah Al Jahnani also took risks,and put herself out, to compete,in the Poet of the Millions competition.,I have to say, her husband backed her from the start.,But her tribe and family urged her not to compete,and were very much against it.,But, once she started to win,,then they got behind her again.,It turns out that competition and winning is a universal human value.,And she's out there.,Her poetry is about women,,and the life of women in society.,So just by presenting herself,and being in competition with men --,this shows the voting on the program --,it sets a very important example for young women --,these are young women in the audience of the program --,in Abu Dhabi, but also people in the viewing audience. 
 Now you'd think that "American Idol",would introduce a measure of Americanization.,But actually, just the opposite is happening.,By using this engaging popular format,for traditional, local culture,,it actually, in the Gulf, is precipitating a revival,of interest in Nabati poetry,,also in traditional dress and dance and music.,And for Afghanistan,,where the Taliban banned music for many years,,it is reintroducing their traditional music.,They don't sing pop songs,,they sing Afghan music.,And they also have learned how to lose gracefully,,without avenging the winner.,(Laughter),No small thing. 
 And the final, sort of, formulation,of this "American Idol" format,,which has just appeared in Afghanistan,,is a new program called "The Candidate.",And in this program, people present,policy platforms that are then voted on.,Many of them are too young to run for president,,but by putting the issues out there,,they are influencing the presidential race.,So for me, the substance of things unseen,is how reality TV is driving reality.,Thank you.,(Applause)Hello, everyone. Because this is my first time at TED,,I've decided to bring along an old friend,to help break the ice a bit.,Yes. That's right. This is Barbie.,She's 50 years old. And she's looking as young as ever.,(Laughter),But I'd also like to introduce you to,what may be an unfamiliar face.,This is Fulla. Fulla is the Arab world's answer to Barbie. 
 Now, according to proponents of the clash of civilizations,,Barbie and Fulla occupy these completely separate spheres.,They have different interests. They have divergent values.,And should they ever come in contact ...,well, I've got to tell you, it's just not going to be pretty. 
 My experience, however, in the Islamic world is very different.,Where I work, in the Arab region,,people are busy taking up Western innovations,and changing them into things,which are neither conventionally Western,,nor are they traditionally Islamic.,I want to show you two examples.,The first is 4Shbab.,It means "for youth" and it's a new Arab TV channel. 
 (Video): Video clips from across the globe.,The USA.

 The Arab world. 
 (Music) 
 ♫ She was preserved by modesty of the religion ♫,♫ She was adorned by the light of the Quran ♫ 
 Shereen El Feki: 4Shbab has been dubbed Islamic MTV.,Its creator, who is an Egyptian TV producer,called Ahmed Abu Haïba,,wants young people to be inspired,by Islam to lead better lives.,He reckons the best way to get that message across,is to use the enormously popular medium of music videos.,4Shbab was set up as an alternative,to existing Arab music channels.,And they look something like this.,(Music) 
 That, by the way is Haifa Wehbe. She's a Lebanese pop star,and pan-Arab pin-up girl.,In the world of 4Shbab, it's not about bump and grind.,But it's not about fire and brimstone either.,Its videos are intended to show,a kinder, gentler face of Islam,,for young people to deal with life's challenges. 
 Now, my second example is for a slightly younger crowd.,And it's called "The 99.",Now, these are the world's first Islamic superheroes.,They were created by a Kuwaiti psychologist,called Naif Al Mutawa.,And his desire is to rescue Islam,from images of intolerance,,all in a child-friendly format.,"The 99." The characters are meant to embody,the 99 attributes of Allah:,justice, wisdom, mercy, among others.,So, for example, there is the character of Noora.,She is meant to have the power,to look inside people,and see the good and bad in everyone.,Another character called Jami,has the ability to create fantastic inventions. 
 Now, "The 99" is not just a comic book.,It's now a theme park.,There is an animated series in the works.,And by this time next year,,the likes of Superman and Wonder Woman,will have joined forces with "The 99",to beat injustice wherever they find it. 
 "The 99" and 4Shbab are just two of many examples,of this sort of Islamic cross-cultural hybridization.,We're not talking here about a clash of civilizations.,Nor is it some sort of indistinguishable mash.,I like to think of it as a mesh of civilizations,,in which the strands of different cultures are intertwined. 
 Now, while 4Shbab and "The 99" may look new and shiny,,there is actually a very long tradition of this.,Throughout its history, Islam has borrowed and adapted from other civilizations,both ancient and modern.,After all, it's the Quran which encourages us to do this:,"We made you into nations and tribes,so that you could learn from one another.",And to my mind, those are pretty wise words,,no matter what your creed. Thank you.,(Applause)I'm going to show you how terrorism,actually interacts with our daily life.,15 years ago I received a phone call from a friend.,At the time he was looking after the rights of political prisoners,in Italian jails.,He asked me if I wanted to interview the Red Brigades.,Now, as many of you may remember,,the Red Brigades was a terrorist, Marxist organization,which was very active in Italy,from the 1960s until the mid-1980s.,As part of their strategy,the Red Brigades never spoke with anybody, not even with their lawyers.,They sat in silence through their trails,,waving occasionally at family and friends. 
 In 1993 they declared the end of the armed struggle.,And they drew a list of people with whom they would talk,,and tell their story.,And I was one of those people.,When I asked my friend why the Red Brigades want to talk to me,,he said that the female members of the organization,had actually supported my name.,In particular, one person had put it forward.,She was my childhood friend.,She had joined the Red Brigades,and became a leader of the organization. 
 Naturally, I didn't know that,until the day she was arrested.,In fact, I read it in the newspaper.,At the time of the phone call,I just had a baby,,I successfully completed a management buyout,to the company I was working with,,and the last thing I wanted to do was to go back home,and touring the high-security prisons.,But this is exactly what I did,because I wanted to know,what had turned my best friend,into a terrorist,,and why she'd never tried to recruit me.,(Laughter),(Applause) 
 So, this is exactly what I did.,Now, I found the answer very quickly.,I actually had failed,the psychological profiling of a terrorist.,The center committee of the Red Brigades,had judged me too single-minded,and too opinionated to become a good terrorist.,My friend, on the other hand, she was a good terrorist,because she was very good at following orders.,She also embraced violence.,Because she believed that the only way,to unblock what, at the time,,was known as a blocked democracy,,Italy, a country run by the same party for 35 years,was the arms struggle. 
 At the same time, while I was interviewing the Red Brigades,,I also discovered that their life was not ruled,by politics or ideology,,but actually was ruled by economics.,They were constantly short of cash.,They were constantly searching for cash.,Now, contrary to what many people believe,,terrorism is actually a very expensive business.,I'll give you an idea.,In the 1970s, the turnover of the Red Brigades,on a yearly basis,was seven million dollars.,This is roughly between 100,and 150 million, today. 
 Now, you know, if you live underground,it's really hard to produce this amount of money.,But this also explains why, when I was interviewing the Red Brigades,,and then, later on, other arms organizations,,including members of al-Zarqawi group in the Middle East,,everybody was extremely reluctant,to talk about ideology, or politics.,Because they had no idea.,The political vision of a terrorist organization,is decided by the leadership,,which, generally, is never more than five to seven people.,All the others do, day in and day out,,is search for money. 
 Once, for example, I was interviewing,this part-timer from the Red Brigades.,It was a psychiatrist. He loved sailing.,He was a really keen sailor. And he had this beautiful boat.,And he told me that the best time of his life,was when he was a member of the Red Brigades,and he went sailing, every summer, back and forth,from Lebanon, where he would pick up,Soviet weapons from the PLO,,and then carry them all the way to Sardinia,where the other arms organization from Europe would go,and take their share of the arms.,For that service the Red Brigades were actually paid a fee,,which went to fund their organization. 
 So, because I am a trained economist,and I think in economic terms,,all of the sudden I thought,,maybe there is something here.,Maybe there is a link, a commercial link,,between one organization and another one.,But it was only when I interviewed,Mario Moretti, the head of the Red Brigades,,the man who kidnapped and killed Aldo Moro,,Italian former prime minister,,that I finally realized,that terrorism is actually business.,I was having lunch with him,in a high-security prison in Italy.,And as we were eating,,I had the distinct feeling,that I was back in the city of London,,having lunch with a fellow banker or an economist.,This guy thought in the same way I did. 
 So, I decided that I wanted to investigate the economics of terrorism.,Naturally, nobody wanted to fund my research.,In fact, I think many people thought that I was a bit crazy.,You know, that woman that goes around to foundations,asking for money, thinking about the economics of terrorism.,So, in the end, I took a decision,that, in retrospect, did change my life.,I sold my company,,and funded the research myself. 
 And what I discovered,is this parallel reality,,another international economic system,,which runs parallel to our own,,which has been created by arms organizations,since the end of World War II.,And what is even more shocking,is that this system,has followed, step by step, the evolution,of our own system,,of our Western capitalism.,And there are three main stages.,The first one is the state sponsor of terrorism. 
 The second one is the privatization of terrorism.,And the third, of course, is the globalization of terrorism.,So, state sponsor of terrorism,,feature of the Cold War.,This is when the two superpowers were fighting,a war by proxy,,along the periphery of the sphere of influence,,fully funding arms organizations.,A mix of legal and illegal activities is used.,So, the link between crime and terror,is established very early on. 
 And here is the best example,,the Contras in Nicaragua, created by the CIA,,legally funded by the U.S. Congress,,illegally funded by the Reagan administration,via covert operation, for example, the Iran-Contra Affair.,Then comes the late 1970s, early '80s,,and some groups successfully carry out,the privatization of terrorism.,So, they gain independence from the sponsor,,and start funding themselves. 
 Now, again we see a mix of legal and illegal activities.,So, Arafat used to get a percentage,of the smuggling of hashish,from Bekáa Valley, which is the valley between Lebanon and Syria.,And the IRA, which control the private transportation system,in Northern Ireland, did exactly the same thing.,So, every single time,that somebody got into a taxi in Belfast,without knowing, actually,,was funding the IRA. 
 But the great change came, of course,,with globalization and deregulation.,This is when arms organization were able to link up,,also financially, with each other.,But above all, they started to do,serious business with the world of crime.,And together they money-laundered,their dirty business through the same channel.,This is when we see the birth of the transnational,arms organization Al Qaeda.,This is an organization that can raise money across border.,But also that is able to carry out attacks,in more than one country. 
 Now, deregulation also brought back,rogue economics.,So what is rogue economics?,Rogue economics is a force which is constantly,lurking in the background of history.,It comes back at times of great transformation,,globalization being one of those transformations.,It is at this times in which,politics actually loses control of the economy,,and the economy becomes a rogue force,working against us.,It has happened before in history.,It has happened with the fall of the Roman Empire.,It has happened with Industrial Revolution.,And it actually happened again, with the fall of the Berlin wall. 
 Now, I calculated how big was this international,economic system composed by crime,,terror, and illegal economy,,before 9-11.,And it is a staggering 1.5 trillion dollars.,It is trillions, it's not billions.,This is about twice the GDP of the United Kingdom,,soon will be more,,considering where this country is going.,(Laughter) 
 Now, until 9-11,,the bulk of all this money,flew into the U.S. economy,because the bulk of the money was denominated in U.S. dollars,and the money laundering was taking place,inside the United States.,The entry point, of course, of most of this money,were the off-shore facilities.,So, this was a vital injection of cash,into the U.S. economy.,Now, when I went to look at the figures of the U.S. money supply,,the U.S. money supply is the amount,of dollars that the Federal Reserve,prints every year,in order to satisfy,the increase in the demand for dollars,,which, of course, reflects the growth,of the economy. 
 So, when I went to look at those figures, I noted that since the late 1960s,a growing number of these dollars,was actually leaving the United States,,never to come back.,These were money taken out,in suitcases or in containers, in cash of course.,These were money taken out by criminals and money launderers.,These were money taken out to fund,the growth of the terror,,illegal and criminal economy.,So, you see, what is the relationship? 
 The United States actually is a country,that is the reserve currency of the world.,What does it mean? That means that,it has a privilege that other countries do not have.,It can borrow against the total amount of dollars,in circulation in the world.,This privilege is called seigniorage.,No other country can do that.,All the other countries, for example the United Kingdom,,can borrow only against the amount of money,in circulation inside its own borders. 
 So, here is the implication of the relationship,between the worlds of crime, terror, and illegal economy, and our economy.,The U.S. in the 1990s,was borrowing against the growth,of the terror, illegal and criminal economy.,This is how close we are with this world.,Now, this situation changed, of course, after 9-11,,because George Bush launched the War on Terror.,Part of the War on Terror,was the introduction of the Patriot Act.,Now, many of you know that the Patriot Act,is a legislation that greatly reduces,the liberties of Americans in order to protect them,against terrorism. 
 But there is a section of the Patriot Act,which refers specifically to finance.,And it is, in fact, an anti-money-laundering legislation.,What the Patriot Act did was,to prohibit U.S. bank,,and U.S.-registered foreign banks,from doing any businesses with off-shore facilities.,It closed that door between the money laundering,in dollars, and the U.S. economy.,It also gave the U.S. monetary authorities,the right to monitor any dollar transaction,taking place anywhere in the world. 
 Now, you can imagine what was the reaction of the international,finance and banking.,All the bankers said to their clients,,"Get out of the dollars and go and invest somewhere else.",Now, the Euro was a newly born currency,of great opportunity for business, and, of course, for investment.,And this is what people did.,Nobody wants the U.S. monetary authority,to check their relationship,,to monitor their relationship with their clientele.,The same thing happened, of course,,in the world of crime and terror.,People simply moved their money-laundering activities,away from the United States,into Europe. 
 Why did this happen? This happened because,the Patriot Act was a unilateral legislation.,It was introduced only in the United States.,And it was introduced only for the U.S. dollars.,In Europe, a similar legislation,was not introduced.,So, within six months,Europe became the epicenter,of the money-laundering activities,of the world.,So, this is how incredible are the relationship,between the world of crime,and the world of terror,,and our own life. 
 So, why did I tell you this story?,I told you this story because you,must understand that there is a world,that goes well beyond the headlines of the newspapers,,including the personal relationship that you have,with friends and family.,You got to question everything that is told to you,,including what I just told you today.,(Laughter),This is the only way for you,to step into the dark side, and have a look at it.,And believe me,,it's going to be scary.,It's going to be frightful, but it's going to enlighten you.,And, above all, it's not going to be boring.,(Laughter),(Applause)For me they normally happen,nthese career crises,,often, actually, on a Sunday evening,,just as the sun is starting to set,,and the gap between my hopes for myselfnand the reality of my life,starts to diverge so painfully,that I normally end upnweeping into a pillow. 
 I'm mentioning all this --,I'm mentioning all this because I thinknthis is not merely a personal problem;,you may think I'm wrong in this,,but I think we live in an agenwhen our lives are regularly punctuated,by career crises, by momentsnwhen what we thought we knew --,about our lives, about our careers --,comes into contactnwith a threatening sort of reality. 
 It's perhaps easier now than ever beforento make a good living.,It's perhaps harder than ever before,to stay calm, to be freenof career anxiety.,I want to look now, if I may,nat some of the reasons,why we might be feelingnanxiety about our careers.,Why we might be victimsnof these career crises,,as we're weeping softly into our pillows.,One of the reasonsnwhy we might be suffering,is that we are surrounded by snobs. 
 In a way, I've got some bad news,,particularly to anybodynwho's come to Oxford from abroad.,There's a real problem with snobbery,,because sometimes peoplenfrom outside the U.K.,imagine that snobberynis a distinctively U.K. phenomenon,,fixated on country houses and titles.,The bad news is that's not true.,Snobbery is a global phenomenon;nwe are a global organization,,this is a global phenomenon.,What is a snob?,A snob is anybody who takesna small part of you,,and uses that to comento a complete vision of who you are.,That is snobbery. 
 The dominant kind of snobberynthat exists nowadays is job snobbery.,You encounter it within minutesnat a party, when you get asked,that famous iconic questionnof the early 21st century,,"What do you do?",According to how you answer that question,,people are either incrediblyndelighted to see you,,or look at their watchnand make their excuses. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, the opposite of a snobnis your mother. 
 (Laughter) 
 Not necessarily your mother,nor indeed mine,,but, as it were, the ideal mother,,somebody who doesn't carenabout your achievements.,Unfortunately, most peoplenare not our mothers.,Most people make a strict correlationnbetween how much time,,and if you like, love --,not romantic love,nthough that may be something --,but love in general, respect --nthey are willing to accord us,,that will be strictly definednby our position in the social hierarchy. 
 And that's a lot of the reasonnwhy we care so much about our careers,and indeed start caringnso much about material goods.,You know, we're often toldnthat we live in very materialistic times,,that we're all greedy people.,I don't think we arenparticularly materialistic.,I think we live in a society which hasnsimply pegged certain emotional rewards,to the acquisition of material goods.,It's not the material goods we want;nit's the rewards we want.,It's a new way of looking at luxury goods.,The next time you see somebodyndriving a Ferrari, don't think,,"This is somebody who's greedy.",Think, "This is somebody who is incrediblynvulnerable and in need of love." 
 (Laughter) 
 Feel sympathy, rather than contempt. 
 There are other reasons -- 
 (Laughter) 
 There are other reasons why it's perhapsnharder now to feel calm than ever before.,One of these, and it's paradoxical,,because it's linked to somethingnthat's rather nice,,is the hope we all have for our careers.,Never before havenexpectations been so high,about what human beings cannachieve with their lifespan.,We're told, from many sources,nthat anyone can achieve anything.,We've done away with the caste system,,we are now in a system where anyonencan rise to any position they please.,And it's a beautiful idea.,Along with that is a kindnof spirit of equality;,we're all basically equal.,There are no strictly defined hierarchies.,There is one really big problem with this,,and that problem is envy.,Envy, it's a real taboo to mention envy,,but if there's one dominant emotionnin modern society, that is envy.,And it's linked to the spirit of equality. 
 Let me explain.,I think it would be very unusualnfor anyone here, or anyone watching,,to be envious of the Queen of England.,Even though she is much richernthan any of you are,,and she's got a very large house,,the reason why we don't envy hernis because she's too weird. 
 (Laughter) 
 She's simply too strange.,We can't relate to her,nshe speaks in a funny way,,she comes from an odd place.,So we can't relate to her,,and when you can't relatento somebody, you don't envy them. 
 The closer two people are --nin age, in background,,in the process of identification --nthe more there's a danger of envy,,which is incidentally why none of younshould ever go to a school reunion,,because there is no stronger referencenpoint than people one was at school with.,The problem of modern society isnit turns the whole world into a school.,Everybody's wearing jeans,neverybody's the same.,And yet, they're not.,So there's a spirit of equalityncombined with deep inequality,,which can make forna very stressful situation. 
 It's probably as unlikelynthat you would nowadays,become as rich and famous as Bill Gates,,as it was unlikely in the 17th century,that you would accede to the ranksnof the French aristocracy.,But the point is,nit doesn't feel that way.,It's made to feel, by magazinesnand other media outlets,,that if you've got energy, a few brightnideas about technology, a garage --,you, too, could start a major thing. 
 (Laughter) 
 The consequences of this problemnmake themselves felt in bookshops.,When you go to a large bookshopnand look at the self-help sections,,as I sometimes do --,if you analyze self-help booksnproduced in the world today,,there are basically two kinds.,The first kind tells you, "You can do it!nYou can make it! Anything's possible!",The other kind tells you how to cope withnwhat we politely call "low self-esteem,",or impolitely call,n"feeling very bad about yourself." 
 There's a real correlation,between a society that tells peoplenthat they can do anything,,and the existence of low self-esteem.,So that's another way in which somethingnquite positive can have a nasty kickback.,There is another reason whynwe might be feeling more anxious --,about our careers, about our statusnin the world today, than ever before.,And it's, again, linked to something nice.,And that nice thing is called meritocracy. 
 Everybody, all politiciansnon Left and Right,,agree that meritocracy is a great thing,,and we should all be trying to makenour societies really, really meritocratic.,In other words --nwhat is a meritocratic society?,A meritocratic society is one in which,nif you've got talent and energy and skill,,you will get to the top,nnothing should hold you back.,It's a beautiful idea.,The problem is, if younreally believe in a society,where those who merit to getnto the top, get to the top,,you'll also, by implication,nand in a far more nasty way,,believe in a society where thosenwho deserve to get to the bottom,also get to the bottom and stay there.,In other words, your position in lifencomes to seem not accidental,,but merited and deserved.,And that makes failurenseem much more crushing. 
 You know, in the Middle Ages, in England,,when you met a very poor person,,that person would be describednas an "unfortunate" --,literally, somebody who had notnbeen blessed by fortune, an unfortunate.,Nowadays, particularlynin the United States,,if you meet someonenat the bottom of society,,they may unkindly bendescribed as a "loser.",There's a real differencenbetween an unfortunate and a loser,,and that shows 400 yearsnof evolution in society,and our belief in whonis responsible for our lives.,It's no longer the gods, it's us.nWe're in the driving seat. 
 That's exhilarating if you're doing well,,and very crushing if you're not.,It leads, in the worst cases --,in the analysis of a sociologistnlike Emil Durkheim --,it leads to increased rates of suicide.,There are more suicidesnin developed, individualistic countries,than in any other part of the world.,And some of the reason for that,is that people take what happens to themnextremely personally --,they own their success,nbut they also own their failure. 
 Is there any reliefnfrom some of these pressures,that I've been outlining?,I think there is.,I just want to turn to a few of them.,Let's take meritocracy.,This idea that everybody deservesnto get where they get to,,I think it's a crazy idea,ncompletely crazy.,I will support any politiciannof Left and Right,,with any halfway-decent meritocratic idea;,I am a meritocrat in that sense.,But I think it's insane to believe,that we will ever make a societynthat is genuinely meritocratic;,it's an impossible dream. 
 The idea that we will make a societynwhere literally everybody is graded,,the good at the top, bad at the bottom,,exactly done as itnshould be, is impossible.,There are simply too many random factors:,accidents, accidents of birth,,accidents of things droppingnon people's heads, illnesses, etc.,We will never get to grade them,,never get to grade people as they should. 
 I'm drawn to a lovely quotenby St. Augustine in "The City of God,",where he says, "It's a sinnto judge any man by his post.",In modern English that would mean,it's a sin to come to any viewnof who you should talk to,,dependent on their business card.,It's not the post that should count.,According to St. Augustine, only Godncan really put everybody in their place;,he's going to do thatnon the Day of Judgment,,with angels and trumpets,nand the skies will open.,Insane idea, if you'rena secularist person, like me.,But something very valuablenin that idea, nevertheless. 
 In other words, hold your horsesnwhen you're coming to judge people.,You don't necessarily knownwhat someone's true value is.,That is an unknown part of them,,and we shouldn't behavenas though it is known.,There is another source of solacenand comfort for all this.,When we think about failing in life,nwhen we think about failure,,one of the reasons why we fear failing,is not just a loss of income,na loss of status.,What we fear is the judgmentnand ridicule of others.,And it exists. 
 The number one organ of ridicule,nnowadays, is the newspaper.,If you open the newspapernany day of the week,,it's full of peoplenwho've messed up their lives.,They've slept with the wrong person,ntaken the wrong substance,,passed the wrong piece of legislation --,whatever it is, and thennare fit for ridicule.,In other words, they have failed.nAnd they are described as "losers.",Now, is there any alternative to this?,I think the Western tradition shows us onenglorious alternative, which is tragedy. 
 Tragic art, as it developednin the theaters of ancient Greece,,in the fifth century B.C.,nwas essentially an art form,devoted to tracing how people fail,,and also according themna level of sympathy,,which ordinary life would notnnecessarily accord them.,A few years ago,nI was thinking about this,,and I went to "The Sunday Sport,",a tabloid newspaper I don'tnrecommend you start reading,if you're not familiar with it already. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I went to talk to them,about certain of the greatntragedies of Western art.,I wanted to see how they would seizenthe bare bones of certain stories,,if they came in as a news itemnat the news desk on a Saturday afternoon. 
 I mentioned Othello; they'd notnheard of it but were fascinated. 
 (Laughter) 
 I asked them to writena headline for the story.,They came up with "Love-CrazednImmigrant Kills Senator's Daughter.",Splashed across the headline.,I gave them the plotline of Madame Bovary.,Again, a book they werenenchanted to discover.,And they wrote "Shopaholic AdulteressnSwallows Arsenic After Credit Fraud." 
 (Laughter) 
 And then my favorite --,they really do have a kind of geniusnof their own, these guys --,my favorite is Sophocles'nOedipus the King:,"Sex With Mum Was Blinding." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 In a way, if you like, at one endnof the spectrum of sympathy,,you've got the tabloid newspaper.,At the other end of the spectrum,nyou've got tragedy and tragic art.,And I suppose I'm arguingnthat we should learn a little bit,about what's happening in tragic art.,It would be insane to call Hamlet a loser.,He is not a loser, though he has lost.,And I think that is the messagenof tragedy to us,,and why it's so very,nvery important, I think. 
 The other thing about modern societynand why it causes this anxiety,,is that we have nothing at its centernthat is non-human.,We are the first societynto be living in a world,where we don't worshipnanything other than ourselves.,We think very highly of ourselves,nand so we should;,we've put people on the Moon,ndone all sorts of extraordinary things.,And so we tend to worship ourselves.nOur heroes are human heroes.,That's a very new situation.,Most other societies have had,nright at their center,,the worship of something transcendent:na god, a spirit, a natural force,,the universe, whatever it is --nsomething else that is being worshiped.,We've slightly lostnthe habit of doing that,,which is, I think, why we'renparticularly drawn to nature.,Not for the sake of our health,nthough it's often presented that way,,but because it's an escapenfrom the human anthill.,It's an escape from our own competition,,and our own dramas.,And that's why we enjoy lookingnat glaciers and oceans,,and contemplating the Earthnfrom outside its perimeters, etc.,We like to feel in contactnwith something that is non-human,,and that is so deeply important to us. 
 What I think I've been talkingnabout really is success and failure.,And one of the interestingnthings about success,is that we think we know what it means.,If I said that there's somebodynbehind the screen who's very successful,,certain ideas wouldnimmediately come to mind.,You'd think that personnmight have made a lot of money,,achieved renown in some field.,My own theory of success --,I'm somebody who'snvery interested in success,,I really want to be successful,,always thinking,nhow can I be more successful?,But as I get older, I'm also very nuancednabout what that word "success" might mean. 
 Here's an insightnthat I've had about success:,You can't be successful at everything.,We hear a lot of talknabout work-life balance.,Nonsense.,You can't have it all. You can't.,So any vision of successnhas to admit what it's losing out on,,where the element of loss is.,And I think any wise life will accept,,as I say, that there is going to benan element where we're not succeeding. 
 And the thing about a successful lifenis that a lot of the time,,our ideas of what it would meannto live successfully are not our own.,They're sucked in from other people;,chiefly, if you're a man, your father,nand if you're a woman, your mother.,Psychoanalysis has been drumming homenthis message for about 80 years.,No one's quite listening hard enough,nbut I very much believe it's true. 
 And we also suck in messagesnfrom everything from the television,,to advertising, to marketing, etc.,These are hugely powerful forces,that define what we wantnand how we view ourselves.,When we're told that bankingnis a very respectable profession,,a lot of us want to go into banking.,When banking is no longer so respectable,nwe lose interest in banking.,We are highly open to suggestion. 
 So what I want to argue fornis not that we should give up,on our ideas of success,,but we should make surenthat they are our own.,We should focus in on our ideas,,and make sure that we own them;,that we are truly the authorsnof our own ambitions.,Because it's bad enoughnnot getting what you want,,but it's even worse to havenan idea of what it is you want,,and find out, at the end of the journey,,that it isn't, in fact,nwhat you wanted all along. 
 So, I'm going to end it there.,But what I really want to stress is:nby all means, success, yes.,But let's accept the strangenessnof some of our ideas.,Let's probe awaynat our notions of success.,Let's make sure our ideas of successnare truly our own. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: That was fascinating.,But how do you reconcile this idea,of it being bad to thinknof someone as a "loser,",with the idea that a lot of people like,nof seizing control of your life,,and that a society that encourages that,,perhaps has to havensome winners and losers? 
 Alain De Botton: Yes, I thinknit's merely the randomness,of the winning and losing processnthat I want to stress,,because the emphasis nowadays is so muchnon the justice of everything,,and politicians always talk about justice.,Now I'm a firm believer in justice,nI just think that it's impossible.,So we should do everythingnwe can to pursue it,,but we should always remembernthat whoever is facing us,,whatever has happened in their lives,,there will be a strongnelement of the haphazard.,That's what I'm trying to leave room for;,otherwise, it can getnquite claustrophobic. 
 CA: I mean, do you believenthat you can combine,your kind of kinder,ngentler philosophy of work,with a successful economy?,Or do you think that you can't,,but it doesn't matter that much that we'renputting too much emphasis on that? 
 AB: The nightmare thought,is that frightening peoplenis the best way to get work out of them,,and that somehownthe crueler the environment,,the more people will risento the challenge.,You want to think, who would you likenas your ideal dad?,And your ideal dad is somebodynwho is tough but gentle.,And it's a very hard line to make.,We need fathers, as it were,nthe exemplary father figures in society,,avoiding the two extremes,,which is the authoritarianndisciplinarian on the one hand,,and on the other,nthe lax, no-rules option. 
 CA: Alain De Botton. 
 AB: Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I started my journey 30 years ago.,And I worked in mines. And I realized that,this was a world unseen.,And I wanted, through color and large format cameras,and very large prints,,to make a body of work that somehow,became symbols of our,use of the landscape,,how we use the land.,And to me this was,a key component that somehow, through this medium of photography,,which allows us to contemplate these landscapes,,that I thought photography was perfectly suited,to doing this type of work. 
 And after 17 years of photographing large industrial landscapes,,it occurred to me that,oil is underpinning the scale and speed.,Because that is what has changed,,is the speed at which we're taking all our resources.,And so then I went out to develop a whole series,on the landscape of oil.,And what I want to do is to kind of map an arc,that there is extraction, where we're taking it from the ground,,refinement. And that's one chapter. 
 The other chapter that I wanted to look at was,how we use it -- our cities,,our cars, our motorcultures,,where people gather around the vehicle,as a celebration.,And then the third one is this idea of the end of oil,,this entropic end,,where all of our parts of cars, our tires,,oil filters,,helicopters, planes --,where are the landscapes where all of that stuff ends up? 
 And to me, again, photography was,a way in which I could explore and research the world,,and find those places.,And another idea that I had as well,,that was brought forward by an ecologist --,he basically did a calculation where,he took one liter of gas and said,,well, how much carbon it would take, and how much organic material?,It was 23 metric tons for one liter.,So whenever I fill up my gas,,I think of that liter, and how much carbon. 
 And I know that oil comes from the ocean and phytoplankton,,but he did the calculations for our Earth,and what it had to do to produce that amount of energy.,From the photosynthetic growth,,it would take 500 years of that growth,to produce what we use, the 30 billion barrels we use per year. 
 And that also brought me to the fact that,this poses such a risk to our society.,Looking at 30 billion per year,,we look at our two largest suppliers,,Saudi Arabia and now Canada, with its dirty oil.,And together they only form about 15 years of supply.,The whole world, at 1.2 trillion estimated reserves,,only gives us about 45 years.,So, it's not a question of if, but a question of when,peak oil will come upon us. 
 So, to me, using photography --,and I feel that all of us need to now begin to really,take the task of using our talents,,our ways of thinking,,to begin to deal with what I think is probably,one of the most challenging issues of our time,,how to deal with our energy crisis. 
 And I would like to say that, on the other side of it,,30, 40 years from now, the children that I have,,I can look at them and say, "We did everything,we possibly, humanly could do,,to begin to mitigate this,,what I feel is one of the most important and critical,moments in our time. Thank you.,(Applause)Can I say how delighted I am to be away,from the calm of Westminster and Whitehall? (Laughter) 
 This is Kim, a nine-year-old Vietnam girl,,her back ruined by napalm,,and she awakened the conscience of the nation of America,to begin to end the Vietnam War.,This is Birhan, who was the Ethiopian girl,who launched Live Aid in the 1980s,,15 minutes away from death when she was rescued,,and that picture of her being rescued is one that went round the world.,This is Tiananmen Square.,A man before a tank became a picture,that became a symbol for the whole world of resistance.,This next is the Sudanese girl,,a few moments from death,,a vulture hovering in the background,,a picture that went round the world,and shocked people into action on poverty.,This is Neda, the Iranian girl,who was shot while at a demonstration with her father in Iran,only a few weeks ago, and she is now the focus, rightly so,,of the YouTube generation. 
 And what do all these pictures and events have in common?,What they have in common is what we see unlocks,what we cannot see.,What we see unlocks the invisible ties,and bonds of sympathy that bring us together,to become a human community.,What these pictures demonstrate is that,we do feel the pain of others,,however distantly.,What I think these pictures demonstrate,is that we do believe in something bigger than ourselves.,What these pictures demonstrate is,that there is a moral sense across all religions, across all faiths,,across all continents -- a moral sense that,not only do we share the pain of others,,and believe in something bigger than ourselves,but we have a duty to act when we see things,that are wrong that need righted,,see injuries that need to be corrected,,see problems that need to be rectified. 
 There is a story about Olof Palme, the Swedish Prime Minister,,going to see Ronald Reagan in America in the 1980s.,Before he arrived Ronald Reagan said --,and he was the Swedish Social Democratic Prime Minister --,"Isn’t this man a communist?",The reply was, "No, Mr President, he’s an anti-communist.",And Ronald Reagan said, "I don’t care what kind of communist he is!",(Laughter),Ronald Reagan asked Olof Palme,,the Social Democratic Prime Minister of Sweden,,"Well, what do you believe in? Do you want to abolish the rich?",He said, "No, I want to abolish the poor.",Our responsibility is to let everyone have the chance,to realize their potential to the full. 
 I believe there is a moral sense and a global ethic,that commands attention from people of every religion,and every faith, and people of no faith.,But I think what's new is that we now have the capacity,to communicate instantaneously across frontiers,right across the world.,We now have the capacity to find common ground,with people who we will never meet,,but who we will meet through the Internet and through,all the modern means of communication;,that we now have the capacity to organize,and take collective action together,to deal with the problem or an injustice,that we want to deal with;,and I believe that this makes this a unique age in human history,,and it is the start of what I would call,the creation of a truly global society. 
 Go back 200 years when the slave trade was,under pressure from William Wilberforce and all the protesters.,They protested across Britain.,They won public opinion over a long period of time.,But it took 24 years for the campaign to be successful.,What could they have done with the pictures that they could have shown,if they were able to use the modern means of communication,to win people’s hearts and minds? 
 Or if you take Eglantyne Jebb,,the woman who created Save the Children 90 years ago.,She was so appalled by what was happening in Austria,as a result of the First World War and what was happening to children,who were part of the defeated families of Austria,,that in Britain she wanted to take action,,but she had to go house to house,,leaflet to leaflet, to get people to attend a rally,in the Royal Albert Hall,that eventually gave birth to Save the Children,,an international organization that is now fully recognized,as one of the great institutions in our land and in the world.,But what more could she have done,if she’d had the modern means of communications available to her,to create a sense that the injustice that people saw,had to be acted upon immediately? 
 Now look at what’s happened in the last 10 years.,In Philippines in 2001, President Estrada --,a million people texted each other about the corruption of that regime,,eventually brought it down and it was, of course, called the "coup de text." (Laughter),Then you have in Zimbabwe the first election under Robert Mugabe a year ago.,Because people were able to take mobile phone photographs,of what was happening at the polling stations, it was impossible,for that Premier to fix that election in the way that he wanted to do.,Or take Burma and the monks that were blogging out,,a country that nobody knew anything about that was happening, until these blogs,told the world that there was a repression,,meaning that lives were being lost,and people were being persecuted and Aung San Suu Kyi,,who is one of the great prisoners of conscience of the world,,had to be listened to.,Then take Iran itself, and what people are doing today:,following what happened to Neda,,people who are preventing the security services of Iran finding those people,who are blogging out of Iran, any by everybody who is blogging,,changing their address to Tehran, Iran,,and making it difficult for the security services. 
 Take, therefore, what modern technology is capable of:,the power of our moral sense allied to the power of communications,and our ability to organize internationally. 
 That, in my view, gives us the first opportunity as a community,to fundamentally change the world.,Foreign policy can never be the same again. It cannot be run by elites;,it’s got to be run by listening to the public opinions of peoples who are blogging,,who are communicating with each other around the world.,200 years ago the problem we had to solve was slavery.,150 years ago I suppose the main problem in a country like ours,was how young people, children, had the right to education.,100 years ago in most countries in Europe, the pressure was for the right to vote.,50 years ago the pressure was for the right to social security and welfare.,In the last 50-60 years we have seen fascism, anti-Semitism, racism, apartheid,,discrimination on the basis of sex and gender and sexuality;,all these have come under pressure,because of the campaigns that have been run by people to change the world. 
 I was with Nelson Mandela a year ago, when he was in London.,I was at a concert that he was attending to mark his birthday,and for the creation of new resources for his foundation.,I was sitting next to Nelson Mandela -- I was very privileged to do so --,when Amy Winehouse came onto the stage. (Laughter),And Nelson Mandela was quite surprised at the appearance of the singer,and I was explaining to him at the time who she was.,Amy Winehouse said, "Nelson Mandela and I have a lot in common.,My husband too has spent a long time in prison.",(Laughter),Nelson Mandela then went down to the stage,and he summarized the challenge for us all.,He said in his lifetime he had climbed a great mountain, the mountain,of challenging and then defeating racial oppression and defeating apartheid.,He said that there was a greater challenge ahead,,the challenge of poverty, of climate change -- global challenges,that needed global solutions,and needed the creation of a truly global society. 
 We are the first generation which is in a position to do this.,Combine the power of a global ethic,with the power of our ability to communicate,and organize globally, with the challenges that we now face,,most of which are global in their nature.,Climate change cannot be solved in one country,,but has got to be solved by the world working together.,A financial crisis, just as we have seen, could not be solved,by America alone or Europe alone;,it needed the world to work together.,Take the problems of security and terrorism and, equally,,the problem of human rights and development:,they cannot be solved by Africa alone;,they cannot be solved by America or Europe alone.,We cannot solve these problems unless we work together. 
 So the great project of our generation, it seems to me,,is to build for the first time, out of a global ethic,and our global ability to communicate,and organize together, a truly global society,,built on that ethic but with institutions,that can serve that global society and make for a different future.,We have now, and are the first generation with, the power to do this.,Take climate change. Is it not absolutely scandalous,that we have a situation,where we know that there is a climate change problem,,where we know also that that will mean we have to give more resources,to the poorest countries to deal with that,,when we want to create a global carbon market,,but there is no global institution,that people have been able to agree upon,to deal with this problem?,One of the things that has got to come out of Copenhagen in the next few months,is an agreement that there will be,a global environmental institution,that is able to deal,with the problems of persuading the whole of the world,to move along a climate-change agenda. 
 (Applause) 
 One of the reasons why an institution is not in itself enough,is that we have got to persuade people around the world,to change their behavior as well,,so you need that global ethic of fairness and responsibility,across the generations.,Take the financial crisis.,If people in poorer countries can be hit by a crisis that starts in New York,or starts in the sub-prime market of the United States of America.,If people can find that that sub-prime product,has been transferred across nations,many, many times until it ends up in banks in Iceland,or the rest in Britain,,and people's ordinary savings are affected by it,,then you cannot rely on a system of national supervision.,You need in the long run for stability, for economic growth,,for jobs, as well as for financial stability,,global economic institutions that make sure,that growth to be sustained has to be shared,,and are built on the principle,that the prosperity of this world is indivisible. 
 So another challenge for our generation is to create global institutions,that reflect our ideas of fairness and responsibility,,not the ideas that were the basis,of the last stage of financial development over these recent years.,Then take development and take the partnership we need between our countries,and the rest of the world, the poorest part of the world.,We do not have the basis of a proper partnership for the future,,and yet, out of people’s desire for a global ethic,and a global society that can be done. 
 I have just been talking to the President of Sierra Leone.,This is a country of six and a half million people,,but it has only 80 doctors; it has 200 nurses;,it has 120 midwives.,You cannot begin to build a healthcare system for six million people,with such limited resources. 
 Or take the girl I met when I was in Tanzania,,a girl called Miriam.,She was 11 years old; her parents had both died from AIDS,,her mother and then her father.,She was an AIDS orphan being handed,across different extended families to be cared for.,She herself was suffering from HIV;,she was suffering from tuberculosis.,I met her in a field, she was ragged, she had no shoes.,When you looked in her eyes, any girl at the age of eleven,is looking forward to the future,,but there was an unreachable sadness in that girl’s eyes,and if I could have translated that to the rest of the world for that moment,,I believe that all the work that it had done for the global HIV/AIDS fund,would be rewarded by people being prepared to make donations. 
 We must then build a proper relationship between the richest and,the poorest countries,based on our desire that they are able to fend for themselves,with the investment that is necessary in their agriculture,,so that Africa is not a net importer of food, but an exporter of food. 
 Take the problems of human rights and,the problems of security in so many countries around the world.,Burma is in chains, Zimbabwe is a human tragedy,,in Sudan thousands of people have died unnecessarily,for wars that we could prevent.,In the Rwanda Children's Museum,,there is a photograph of a 10-year-old boy,and the Children's Museum is commemorating the lives that were lost,in the Rwandan genocide where a million people died. 
 There is a photograph of a boy called David.,Beside that photograph there is the information about his life.,It said "David, age 10.",David: ambition to be a doctor.,Favorite sport: football. What did he enjoy most?,Making people laugh.,How did he die?,Tortured to death.,Last words said to his mother who was also tortured to death:,"Don't worry. The United Nations are coming.",And we never did. 
 And that young boy believed our promises,that we would help people in difficulty in Rwanda,,and we never did. 
 So we have got to create in this world also,institutions for peacekeeping and humanitarian aid,,but also for reconstruction and security,for some of the conflict-ridden states of the world.,So my argument today is basically this.,We have the means by which we could create a truly global society.,The institutions of this global society can be created by our endeavors.,That global ethic can infuse the fairness and responsibility that is necessary,for these institutions to work,,but we should not lose the chance in this generation,,in this decade in particular, with President Obama in America,,with other people working with us around the world,,to create global institutions for the environment,,and for finance,,and for security and for development,,that make sense of our responsibility to other peoples,,our desire to bind the world together, and,our need to tackle problems that everybody knows exist. 
 It is said that in Ancient Rome that when Cicero spoke to his audiences,,people used to turn to each other and say about Cicero, "Great speech.",But it is said that in Ancient Greece,when Demosthenes spoke to his audiences,,people turned to each other and didn’t say "Great speech.",They said, "Let's march.",We should be marching towards a global society.,Thank you. 
 (Applause)Over the next five minutes,,my intention is to transformnyour relationship with sound.,Let me start with the observation,that most of the soundnaround us is accidental;,much of it is unpleasant. (Traffic noise),We stand on street corners,nshouting over noise like this,,pretending it doesn't exist.,This habit of suppressing sound has meant,that our relationship with soundnhas become largely unconscious. 
 There are four major waysnsound is affecting you all the time,,and I'd like to raise themnin your consciousness today.,The first is physiological. 
 (Alarm clocks ring) 
 Sorry about that.,I just gave you a shot of cortisol,nyour fight-flight hormone.,Sounds are affectingnyour hormone secretions all the time,,but also your breathing, heart rate --nwhich I just also did --,and your brainwaves. 
 It's not just unpleasant soundsnlike that that do it.,This is surf. (Ocean waves),It has the frequency of roughlyn12 cycles per minute.,Most people find that very soothing,,and, interestingly, 12 cycles per minutenis roughly the frequency,of the breathing of a sleeping human,,so there is a deep resonancenwith being at rest.,We also associate itnwith being stress-free and on holiday. 
 The second way in which soundnaffects you is psychological.,Music is the most powerful formnof sound that we know,that affects our emotional state.n(Albinoni's Adagio),This is guaranteed to make most of younfeel pretty sad if I leave it on.,Music is not the only kind of sound,nhowever, which affects your emotions. 
 Natural sound can do that, too.,Birdsong, for example, is a soundnwhich most people find reassuring.,There's a reason:nover hundreds of thousands of years,we've learned that when the birdsnare singing, things are safe.,It's when they stopnyou need to be worried. 
 The third way in whichnsound affects you is cognitively.,You can't understand two peoplentalking at once (Voice-over),or in this case, one person talking twice.,You have to choose which menyou're going to listen to. 
 We have a very small amount of bandwidthnfor processing auditory input,,which is why noise like this ... 
 (Office noise) 
 is extremely damaging for productivity.,If you have to worknin an open-plan office like this,,your productivity is greatly reduced.,And whatever number you're thinking of,nit probably isn't as bad as this. 
 [Open-plan offices productivity down 66\%] 
 You are one-third as productivenin open-plan offices as in quiet rooms.,I have a tip for you:,if you work in spaces like that,ncarry headphones with you,,with a soothing sound like birdsong.,Put them on, and your productivityngoes back up to triple what it would be. 
 The fourth way in whichnsound affects us is behaviorally.,With all that other stuff going on,,it would be amazingnif our behavior didn't change. 
 (Techno music) 
 So ask yourself: Is this personnever going to drive,at a steady 28 miles per hour?,I don't think so.,At the simplest, you movenaway from unpleasant sound,and towards pleasant sounds.,So if I were to play this ... 
 (Jackhammer) 
 for more than a few seconds,nyou'd feel uncomfortable;,for more than a few minutes,nyou'd be leaving the room in droves.,For people who can't get awaynfrom noise like that,,it's extremely damaging for their health. 
 And that's not the only thingnthat bad sound damages.,Most retail sound is inappropriatenand accidental, even hostile,,and it has a dramatic effect on sales.,For you retailers, you may wantnto look away before I show this slide. 
 [Inappropriate retail soundscapesnsales down 28\%] 
 They're losing up to 30 percentnof their business,with people leaving shops faster,nor just turning around at the door.,We've all done it, left the area,,because the sound in there is so dreadful. 
 I want to spend just a momentntalking about the model we've developed,,which allows us to start at the topnand look at the drivers of sound,,analyze the soundscape,and then predict the four outcomesnI just talked about.,Or start at the bottomnand say what outcomes we want,,and then design a soundscapento have a desired effect.,At last we've gotnsome science we can apply.,And we're in the businessnof designing soundscapes. 
 Just a word on music.,Music is the most powerful sound there is,noften inappropriately deployed.,It's powerful for two reasons:,you recognize it fast,nand you associate it very powerfully.,I'll give you two examples. 
 (First chord of "A Hard Day's Night") 
 Most of you recognize that immediately.,The younger, maybe not. 
 (Laughter) 
 (First notes of "Jaws" theme) 
 Most of you associate that with something!,Now, those are one-secondnsamples of music.,Music is very powerful,,and unfortunately, it's veneeringncommercial spaces, often inappropriately.,I hope that's going to changenover the next few years. 
 Let me talk about brands for a moment,nsince some of you run brands.,Every brand is out therenmaking sound right now.,There are eight expressions of a brandnin sound; they're all important.,And every brand needs to havenguidelines at the center.,I'm glad to saynthat is starting to happen now. 
 (Intel ad jingle) 
 You all recognize that one. 
 (Nokia ringtone) 
 This is the most-played tunenin the world today --,1.8 billion times a day,nthat tune is played. 
 (Laughter) 
 And it cost Nokia absolutely nothing. 
 I'll leave you with four golden rules,nfor those of you who run businesses,,for commercial sound.,First, make it congruent,,pointing in the same directionnas your visual communication.,That increases impactnby over 1,100 percent.,If your sound is pointingnthe opposite direction, incongruent,,you reduce impact by 86 percent.,That's an order of magnitude, up or down.,This is important.,Secondly, make it appropriatento the situation.,Thirdly, make it valuable.,Give people something with the sound,ndon't just bombard them with stuff.,Finally, test and test it again.,Sound is complex; there are manyncountervailing influences.,It can be a bit like a bowl of spaghetti:,sometimes you just have to eat itnand see what happens. 
 So I hope this talk has raised soundnin your consciousness.,If you're listening consciously,,you can take controlnof the sound around you.,It's good for your healthnand for your productivity.,If we all do that, we move to a state,that I like to think will bensound living in the world.,I'll leave you with more birdsong.n(Birds chirping),I recommend at least five minutesna day, but there's no maximum dose. 
 Thank you for lending me your ears today. 
 (Applause)There's an old saying, "Just because you can't see something,,doesn't mean it's not there.",My work is -- it's a reflection of myself.,What I wanted to do is to,show the world that the little things,can be the biggest things.,We all seem to think that,,you know, if we look down on the ground, there's nothing there.,And we use the word "nothing.",Nothing doesn't exist, because there is always something.,My mother told me that, when I was a child,,that I should always respect the little things. 
 What made me do this work? I shall go into my story.,This all started when I was age five.,What made me do it? At school, I will admit this:,academically, I couldn't express myself.,So I was, more or less, classed as "nothing.",My world was seen as less.,So I decided I didn't really want to be a part of that world.,I thought, I need to retreat,into something else.,So when my mother used to take me to school,,she thought I was at school,,and I used to do a U-turn, when her back was turned,,and run off and hide in the shed at the back of the garden. 
 Now, the one time I was in the shed,,and my mother suspected something,,thinking I was at school.,My mother was like the woman in Tom and Jerry.,So you'd just see her feet.,(Laughter),So I was hiding in the shed, like that.,And all of a sudden ...,And then I saw her legs.,And then she said -- grabbed me like that, because my mother was quite big --,and she lifted me up and she says,,"How come you're not at school?",I told her I couldn't face it because the way,the teacher was treating me, ridiculing me,,and using me as an example of failure.,So I told her.,At that age, obviously, I couldn't express it that way,,but I told her I didn't feel right.,And then she just said, "You're going back to school tomorrow.",And walked off. And I didn't expect that,,because I expected one of these ...,But I didn't get it. 
 So I'm sitting there thinking.,And as I looked down on the ground,,I noticed there was some ants running around.,And I went into this little fantasy world.,And I thought,,"These ants, are they looking for the queen ant?,Or do they need somewhere to live?",So I thought "Perhaps,,if I made these ants some apartments,,they'll move in.",(Laughter),So I did.,And how I set about that, I got some splinters of wood.,And I sliced the little splinters of wood with a broken shard of glass,,constructed this little apartment.,Well it looked like a little shanty shed when I'd finished.,But I thought, perhaps the ant won't know, it'll probably move in.,And so they did.,That was a bit crude, at the time. And I made all these little apartments,and little merry-go-rounds, seesaws and swings, little ladders.,And then I encouraged the ants to come 'round by putting sugar and things like that.,And then I sat down and all the ants came along.,And all I could hear was "Is this for us?" 
 (Laughter) 
 And I say, "Yes, they're all for you.",And they moved in, and decided not to pay me any rent.,(Laughter),And from there I was watching this little world.,It became part of me. 
 When I discovered that I had this gift,,I wanted to experiment with this world,that we can't see.,So I realized that there was more to life,than just everything that we see around us that's huge.,So I started to educate myself on this molecular level.,And as I got older, I continued. I showed my mother.,My mother told me to take it smaller. 
 Now I shall show you something here.,And I'll explain.,As you can see,,that's a pinhead. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Now that is called the Huf Haus.,The gentleman who commissioned me to do this,was a gentleman called Peter Huf.,And he says to me "Willard, can you put my house on a pinhead?" 
 (Laughter) 
 So I say, "How are you going to fit in there?" 
 (Laughter) 
 And then he said to me,,"I don't believe you can do it. Can you really do it?" 
 And I says, "Well, try me.",And then he said, "But I don't believe that you can do this." So I said, "OK." 
 So, to cut a long story short,,I went home, went underneath the microscope,,and I crushed up a piece of glass,,crushed it up.,And underneath the microscope,there were splinters of glass.,Some of them were quite jagged.,So I was crushing up these pieces of glass,,which, as you can see,,that's the actual frame of the house.,And the actual roof is made up of a fiber,,which I found in my sister's old teddy bear.,(Laughter),So I got the teddy bear and I said,,"Do you mind if I pull out one of your fibers?",So I did.,And I looked at it beneath the microscope. And some of it was flat.,So I decided to slice these up,with the tool that I make,by -- I sharpen the end of a needle into a blade.,And then I actually,slow down my whole nervous system.,And then I work between my heartbeat,,I have one-and-a-half seconds,to actually move.,And at the same time I have to watch I don't inhale,my own work, at the same time.,(Laughter),(Applause),Because that has happened to me. 
 (Laughter) 
 So what I did, like I said, come back to the glass.,I found these little bits of glass.,And I had to make them square.,So I'm thinking "How can I do this?",So what I did, I got an oilstone. Broke the edge of an oilstone off.,And what I did, I took pieces of glass. And I started to rub them.,I used a little tweezer which I made from a hair clip.,And I built rubber around the end of the tweezer so it wouldn't crush the glass.,And then I started rubbing, very very gently,,till some of the edges were quite square. And then I constructed it.,And how I constructed it,,is by making grooves in the top of the pinhead.,And then pushing the glass in with its own friction.,And as I was doing it, what happened?,The instrument that I used turned into a catapult.,And it went like this ...,And then that was it. 
 (Laughter) 
 Gone.,So I'm thinking, "Mr. Huf isn't going to be very happy,when I told him his house has gone to another,,into the atmosphere somewhere.",So to cut the story short,,I decided that I had to go back and do it.,So I found some more. And I decided to, sort of,,construct it very, very slowly,,holding my breath, working between my heartbeat,,and making sure everything is leveled.,Because it's such a small sculpture,,nothing can go wrong.,And I decided to build it up.,Then I used fibers out of my jumper,,which I held and stretched.,And made the beams going around the house.,And the actual windows and the balcony,had to be sort of constructed.,I used a money spider's web,to actually attach certain things,,which sent me insane.,But I managed to do it.,And when I finished it, I came back the next day.,I noticed that the house was occupied.,Have we ever heard of a dust mite?,Darren dust mite and his family moved in. 
 (Laughter) 
 So basically I'd completed the house.,And there you are. 
 (Applause) 
 (Laughter) 
 Right. As you can see,,Bart Simpson is having a little argument.,I think they're arguing about the space on the pin.,There's not enough room for the two of them.,So I didn't think he was going to throw Bart off.,I think he was just warning him actually.,But this one was made out of a nylon tag,out of my shirt.,What I did, I plucked the tag out,and put it underneath the microscope.,I used the needle which has got a slight blade on the end.,Can anybody see the blade on the end of that needle? 
 Audience: No. 
 WW: So what I did is the same process where I,just kind of hold my breath,and just work away very, very slowly,,manipulating the plastic, cutting it, because it behaves different.,Whenever you work on that level, things behave different.,Because it's on this molecular level things change,and they act different.,And sometimes they turn into little catapults and things go up in the air.,And, you know, all different things happen.,But I had to make a little barrier, going around it, out of cellophane,,to stop it moving.,Then static electricity set in.,And it went ...,And I'm trying to remove it. And the static is interfering with everything.,So there is sweat dripping off my head,,because I have to carve Homer Simpson like that, in that position.,And after I've cut out the shape,,then I have to make sure that there is room for Bart's neck. 
 So after I've done the same thing,,then I have to paint it.,And after I've actually sculpted them,,I have to paint them.,I experimented with a --,I found a dead fly.,And I plucked the hair off the fly's head.,Decided to make a paintbrush.,(Laughter),But I would never do it to a living fly.,(Laughter),Because I've heard a fly in pain.,And they go "Meow! Ow!",Even though they get on our nerves,,I would never kill an insect,because, "All creatures great and small" --,there is a hymn that says that.,So what I decided to do,is to pluck fine hair out of my face.,And I looked at it underneath the microscope.,That was the paintbrush.,And whilst I'm painting I have to be very careful,,because the paint starts to turn into little blobs.,And it starts to dry very quickly.,So I have to be very quick.,If I'm not, it will end up looking,not like what it's supposed to look like.,It could end up looking like Humpty Dumpty or somebody else.,So I have to be very very careful. 
 This one took me approximately,,I would say, six to seven weeks.,My work, rough estimate,,sometimes five, six to seven weeks;,you can't always anticipate.,(Applause),As you can see,,that's Charlton Heston brought down to size.,(Laughter),He says to me, "Willard" --,You can see him saying, "Why me?",I says, "I enjoyed your film. That's why.",As you can see, there's an aphid fly there.,That's just to show the scale,and the actual size of the sculpture.,I would say it probably measures ...,a quarter of a millimeter.,In America they say a period stop.,So say if you cut a period stop in half,,a full stop, that's about the size of the whole thing.,It's made -- the chariot is made of gold. 
 And Charlton Heston is made of a floating fiber,,which I took out of the air.,When the sunlight comes through the window you see these little fibers.,And what I normally do is walk 'round a room --,(Laughter) --,trying to find one. And then I put it underneath the microscope.,I remember one time I was doing it, and the window was open.,And there was a lady standing by the bus stop.,And she saw me walking around like this.,(Laughter),And then she looked at me.,And then I went ...,And then she went, "Hmm, OK, he's not mad.",Yeah, to actually do this thing --,the actual chariot is made of gold.,I had a 24-karat gold ring.,And I cut off a little flake of gold.,And I bent it 'round,,and made it into the chariot.,And the horse is made from nylon.,And the spider's web is for the reins on the horse.,To get the symmetrical shape of the horse,was very difficult,,because I had to get the horse to rear up,and look as though it was in some kind of action. 
 When I did this one,,a gentleman seen it and said to me,,"There's no way you can do this, you must have used some kind of machine.,There's no way a man can do that.,It must be a machine.",So I says, "OK then, if you say it's a machine ...",(Laughter),(Applause),That one took me approximately six weeks.,(Applause) 
 The most famous statue in the world.,This one, I would say,,was a serious challenge.,(Laughter),Because I had to put the torch on the top.,That one is, more or less, the same type of process.,The bottom of it is carved from a grain of sand,,because I wanted to get a bit of the stone effect.,I used a microscopic shard of diamond,to actually carve the actual base.,Well, I can look at this one and I can be very proud of this,,because that statue has always sort of,kept an image in my head of, you know,,the beginning of people coming to America.,So it's sort of Ellis Island, and seeing America for the first time.,And that's the first thing they saw.,So I wanted to have that little image.,And this is it.,(Laughter) 
 And we all know that is the Hulk.,I wanted to create movement in the eye of a needle.,Because we know we see needles,,but people aren't familiar with the eye of a needle,apart from putting a thread through it.,So I broke the needle.,And made a needle look like,the Hulk's broken it.,It's -- I had to make little holes,in the base of the needle, to shove his feet in.,So most of my work, I don't use glue.,They go in with their own friction.,And that's how I managed to do it.,As you can see, he's looking at the moment. He's got a little grimace on his face.,And his mouth must be probably about,three microns.,So the eyes are probably about one micron or something. 
 That ship there,,that's made from 24-karat gold.,And I normally rig it with the web of a money spider.,But I had to rig it with strands of glue.,Because the web of the spider, it was sending me insane,,because I couldn't get the web to move off.,And that's 24-karat gold. And it's constructed. I built it.,Constructed each plank of gold.,And the whole thing is sort of symmetrical.,The flag had to be made out of little strands of gold.,It's almost like doing a surgical operation to get this thing right.,(Applause) 
 As you can see, dressage.,(Laughter),It's something I wanted to do just to show how I could get the symmetrical shape.,The actual rigging on the reins on the horse,are made from the same sort of thing.,And that was done with a particle from my shirt.,And the pinhead I've made green around there,by scraping the particles off a green shirt,and then pressed onto the needle.,It's very painstaking work,,but the best things come in small packages. 
 (Laughter) 
 Bruno Giussani: Willard Wigan! 
 (Applause)How do you observe something you can't see?,This is the basic question of somebody who's interested,in finding and studying black holes.,Because black holes are objects,whose pull of gravity is so intense,that nothing can escape it, not even light,,so you can't see it directly. 
 So, my story today about black holes,is about one particular black hole.,I'm interested in finding whether or not,there is a really massive, what we like to call,"supermassive" black hole at the center of our galaxy.,And the reason this is interesting is that,it gives us an opportunity to prove,whether or not these exotic objects really exist.,And second, it gives us the opportunity,to understand how these supermassive black holes,interact with their environment,,and to understand how they affect the formation and evolution,of the galaxies which they reside in. 
 So, to begin with,,we need to understand what a black hole is,so we can understand the proof of a black hole.,So, what is a black hole?,Well, in many ways a black hole is an incredibly simple object,,because there are only three characteristics that you can describe:,the mass,,the spin, and the charge.,And I'm going to only talk about the mass.,So, in that sense, it's a very simple object.,But in another sense, it's an incredibly complicated object,that we need relatively exotic physics to describe,,and in some sense represents the breakdown of our physical understanding,of the universe. 
 But today, the way I want you to understand a black hole,,for the proof of a black hole,,is to think of it as an object,whose mass is confined to zero volume.,So, despite the fact that I'm going to talk to you about,an object that's supermassive,,and I'm going to get to what that really means in a moment,,it has no finite size.,So, this is a little tricky. 
 But fortunately there is a finite size that you can see,,and that's known as the Schwarzschild radius.,And that's named after the guy who recognized,why it was such an important radius.,This is a virtual radius, not reality; the black hole has no size.,So why is it so important?,It's important because it tells us,that any object can become a black hole.,That means you, your neighbor, your cellphone,,the auditorium can become a black hole,if you can figure out how to compress it down,to the size of the Schwarzschild radius. 
 At that point, what's going to happen?,At that point gravity wins.,Gravity wins over all other known forces.,And the object is forced to continue to collapse,to an infinitely small object.,And then it's a black hole.,So, if I were to compress the Earth down to the size of a sugar cube,,it would become a black hole,,because the size of a sugar cube is its Schwarzschild radius. 
 Now, the key here is to figure out what that Schwarzschild radius is.,And it turns out that it's actually pretty simple to figure out.,It depends only on the mass of the object.,Bigger objects have bigger Schwarzschild radii.,Smaller objects have smaller Schwarzschild radii.,So, if I were to take the sun,and compress it down to the scale of the University of Oxford,,it would become a black hole. 
 So, now we know what a Schwarzschild radius is.,And it's actually quite a useful concept,,because it tells us not only,when a black hole will form,,but it also gives us the key elements for the proof of a black hole.,I only need two things.,I need to understand the mass of the object,I'm claiming is a black hole,,and what its Schwarzschild radius is.,And since the mass determines the Schwarzschild radius,,there is actually only one thing I really need to know. 
 So, my job in convincing you,that there is a black hole,is to show that there is some object,that's confined to within its Schwarzschild radius.,And your job today is to be skeptical.,Okay, so, I'm going to talk about no ordinary black hole;,I'm going to talk about supermassive black holes. 
 So, I wanted to say a few words about what an ordinary black hole is,,as if there could be such a thing as an ordinary black hole.,An ordinary black hole is thought to be the end state,of a really massive star's life.,So, if a star starts its life off,with much more mass than the mass of the Sun,,it's going to end its life by exploding,and leaving behind these beautiful supernova remnants that we see here.,And inside that supernova remnant,is going to be a little black hole,that has a mass roughly three times the mass of the Sun.,On an astronomical scale,that's a very small black hole. 
 Now, what I want to talk about are the supermassive black holes.,And the supermassive black holes are thought to reside at the center of galaxies.,And this beautiful picture taken with the Hubble Space Telescope,shows you that galaxies come in all shapes and sizes.,There are big ones. There are little ones.,Almost every object in that picture there is a galaxy.,And there is a very nice spiral up in the upper left.,And there are a hundred billion stars in that galaxy,,just to give you a sense of scale.,And all the light that we see from a typical galaxy,,which is the kind of galaxies that we're seeing here,,comes from the light from the stars.,So, we see the galaxy because of the star light. 
 Now, there are a few relatively exotic galaxies.,I like to call these the prima donna of the galaxy world,,because they are kind of show offs.,And we call them active galactic nuclei.,And we call them that because their nucleus,,or their center, are very active.,So, at the center there, that's actually where,most of the starlight comes out from.,And yet, what we actually see is light,that can't be explained by the starlight.,It's way more energetic.,In fact, in a few examples it's like the ones that we're seeing here.,There are also jets emanating out from the center.,Again, a source of energy that's very difficult to explain,if you just think that galaxies are composed of stars. 
 So, what people have thought is that perhaps,there are supermassive black holes,which matter is falling on to.,So, you can't see the black hole itself,,but you can convert the gravitational energy of the black hole,into the light we see.,So, there is the thought that maybe supermassive black holes,exist at the center of galaxies.,But it's a kind of indirect argument. 
 Nonetheless, it's given rise to the notion,that maybe it's not just these prima donnas,that have these supermassive black holes,,but rather all galaxies might harbor these,supermassive black holes at their centers.,And if that's the case -- and this is an example of a normal galaxy;,what we see is the star light.,And if there is a supermassive black hole,,what we need to assume is that it's a black hole on a diet.,Because that is the way to suppress the energetic phenomena that we see,in active galactic nuclei. 
 If we're going to look for these stealth black holes,at the center of galaxies,,the best place to look is in our own galaxy, our Milky Way.,And this is a wide field picture,taken of the center of the Milky Way.,And what we see is a line of stars.,And that is because we live in a galaxy which has,a flattened, disk-like structure.,And we live in the middle of it, so when we look towards the center,,we see this plane which defines the plane of the galaxy,,or line that defines the plane of the galaxy. 
 Now, the advantage of studying our own galaxy,is it's simply the closest example of the center of a galaxy,that we're ever going to have, because the next closest galaxy,is 100 times further away.,So, we can see far more detail in our galaxy,than anyplace else.,And as you'll see in a moment, the ability to see detail,is key to this experiment. 
 So, how do astronomers prove that there is a lot of mass,inside a small volume?,Which is the job that I have to show you today.,And the tool that we use is to watch the way,stars orbit the black hole.,Stars will orbit the black hole,in the very same way that planets orbit the sun.,It's the gravitational pull,that makes these things orbit.,If there were no massive objects these things would go flying off,,or at least go at a much slower rate,because all that determines how they go around,is how much mass is inside its orbit. 
 So, this is great, because remember my job is to show,there is a lot of mass inside a small volume.,So, if I know how fast it goes around, I know the mass.,And if I know the scale of the orbit I know the radius.,So, I want to see the stars,that are as close to the center of the galaxy as possible.,Because I want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible.,So, this means that I want to see a lot of detail.,And that's the reason that for this experiment we've used,the world's largest telescope. 
 This is the Keck observatory. It hosts two telescopes,with a mirror 10 meters, which is roughly,the diameter of a tennis court.,Now, this is wonderful,,because the campaign promise,of large telescopes is that is that the bigger the telescope,,the smaller the detail that we can see.,But it turns out these telescopes, or any telescope on the ground,has had a little bit of a challenge living up to this campaign promise.,And that is because of the atmosphere.,Atmosphere is great for us; it allows us,to survive here on Earth.,But it's relatively challenging for astronomers,who want to look through the atmosphere to astronomical sources. 
 So, to give you a sense of what this is like,,it's actually like looking at a pebble,at the bottom of a stream.,Looking at the pebble on the bottom of the stream,,the stream is continuously moving and turbulent,,and that makes it very difficult to see the pebble on the bottom of the stream.,Very much in the same way, it's very difficult,to see astronomical sources, because of the,atmosphere that's continuously moving by. 
 So, I've spent a lot of my career working on ways,to correct for the atmosphere, to give us a cleaner view.,And that buys us about a factor of 20.,And I think all of you can agree that if you can,figure out how to improve life by a factor of 20,,you've probably improved your lifestyle by a lot,,say your salary, you'd notice, or your kids, you'd notice. 
 And this animation here shows you one example of,the techniques that we use, called adaptive optics.,You're seeing an animation that goes between,an example of what you would see if you don't use this technique --,in other words, just a picture that shows the stars --,and the box is centered on the center of the galaxy,,where we think the black hole is.,So, without this technology you can't see the stars.,With this technology all of a sudden you can see it.,This technology works by introducing a mirror,into the telescope optics system,that's continuously changing to counteract what the atmosphere is doing to you.,So, it's kind of like very fancy eyeglasses for your telescope. 
 Now, in the next few slides I'm just going to focus on,that little square there.,So, we're only going to look at the stars inside that small square,,although we've looked at all of them.,So, I want to see how these things have moved.,And over the course of this experiment, these stars,have moved a tremendous amount.,So, we've been doing this experiment for 15 years,,and we see the stars go all the way around. 
 Now, most astronomers have a favorite star,,and mine today is a star that's labeled up there, SO-2.,Absolutely my favorite star in the world.,And that's because it goes around in only 15 years.,And to give you a sense of how short that is,,the sun takes 200 million years to go around the center of the galaxy.,Stars that we knew about before, that were as close to the center of the galaxy,as possible, take 500 years.,And this one, this one goes around in a human lifetime.,That's kind of profound, in a way. 
 But it's the key to this experiment. The orbit tells me,how much mass is inside a very small radius.,So, next we see a picture here that shows you,before this experiment the size to which we could,confine the mass of the center of the galaxy.,What we knew before is that there was four million,times the mass of the sun inside that circle.,And as you can see, there was a lot of other stuff inside that circle.,You can see a lot of stars.,So, there was actually lots of alternatives,to the idea that there was a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy,,because you could put a lot of stuff in there. 
 But with this experiment, we've confined,that same mass to a much smaller volume,that's 10,000 times smaller.,And because of that, we've been able to show,that there is a supermassive black hole there.,To give you a sense of how small that size is,,that's the size of our solar system.,So, we're cramming four million times the mass of the sun,into that small volume. 
 Now, truth in advertising. Right?,I have told you my job is to get it down to the Schwarzchild radius.,And the truth is, I'm not quite there.,But we actually have no alternative today,to explaining this concentration of mass.,And, in fact, it's the best evidence we have to date,for not only existence of a supermassive black hole,at the center of our own galaxy, but any in our universe.,So, what next? I actually think,this is about as good as we're going to do with today's technology,,so let's move on with the problem. 
 So, what I want to tell you, very briefly,,is a few examples,of the excitement of what we can do today,at the center of the galaxy, now that we know that there is,,or at least we believe,,that there is a supermassive black hole there.,And the fun phase of this experiment,is, while we've tested some of our ideas,about the consequences of a supermassive black hole,being at the center of our galaxy,,almost every single one,has been inconsistent with what we actually see.,And that's the fun. 
 So, let me give you the two examples.,You can ask, "What do you expect,for the old stars, stars that have been around the center of the galaxy,for a long time, they've had plenty of time to interact with the black hole.",What you expect there is that old stars,should be very clustered around the black hole.,You should see a lot of old stars next to that black hole. 
 Likewise, for the young stars, or in contrast, the young stars,,they just should not be there.,A black hole does not make a kind neighbor to a stellar nursery.,To get a star to form, you need a big ball of gas and dust to collapse.,And it's a very fragile entity.,And what does the big black hole do?,It strips that gas cloud apart.,It pulls much stronger on one side than the other,and the cloud is stripped apart.,In fact, we anticipated that star formation shouldn't proceed in that environment. 
 So, you shouldn't see young stars.,So, what do we see?,Using observations that are not the ones I've shown you today,,we can actually figure out which ones are old and which ones are young.,The old ones are red.,The young ones are blue. And the yellow ones, we don't know yet.,So, you can already see the surprise.,There is a dearth of old stars.,There is an abundance of young stars, so it's the exact opposite of the prediction. 
 So, this is the fun part.,And in fact, today, this is what we're trying to figure out,,this mystery of how do you get --,how do you resolve this contradiction.,So, in fact, my graduate students,are, at this very moment, today, at the telescope,,in Hawaii, making observations to get us,hopefully to the next stage,,where we can address this question,of why are there so many young stars,,and so few old stars.,To make further progress we really need to look at the orbits,of stars that are much further away.,To do that we'll probably need much more,sophisticated technology than we have today. 
 Because, in truth, while I said we're correcting,for the Earth's atmosphere, we actually only,correct for half the errors that are introduced.,We do this by shooting a laser up into the atmosphere,,and what we think we can do is if we,shine a few more that we can correct the rest.,So this is what we hope to do in the next few years.,And on a much longer time scale,,what we hope to do is build even larger telescopes,,because, remember, bigger is better in astronomy. 
 So, we want to build a 30 meter telescope.,And with this telescope we should be able to see,stars that are even closer to the center of the galaxy.,And we hope to be able to test some of,Einstein's theories of general relativity,,some ideas in cosmology about how galaxies form.,So, we think the future of this experiment,is quite exciting. 
 So, in conclusion, I'm going to show you an animation,that basically shows you how these,orbits have been moving, in three dimensions.,And I hope, if nothing else,,I've convinced you that, one, we do in fact,have a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy.,And this means that these things do exist in our universe,,and we have to contend with this, we have to explain,how you can get these objects in our physical world. 
 Second, we've been able to look at that interaction,of how supermassive black holes interact,,and understand, maybe, the role in which they play,in shaping what galaxies are, and how they work. 
 And last but not least,,none of this would have happened,without the advent of the tremendous progress,that's been made on the technology front.,And we think that this is a field that is moving incredibly fast,,and holds a lot in store for the future.,Thanks very much.,(Applause)How do you feed a city?,It's one of the great questions of our time.,Yet it's one that's rarely asked.,We take it for granted that if we go into a shop,or restaurant, or indeed into this theater's foyer in about an hour's time,,there is going to be food there waiting for us,,having magically come from somewhere. 
 But when you think that every day for a city the size of London,,enough food has to be produced,,transported, bought and sold,,cooked, eaten, disposed of,,and that something similar has to happen every day,for every city on earth,,it's remarkable that cities get fed at all. 
 We live in places like this as if,they're the most natural things in the world,,forgetting that because we're animals,and that we need to eat,,we're actually as dependent on the natural world,as our ancient ancestors were.,And as more of us move into cities,,more of that natural world is being,transformed into extraordinary landscapes like the one behind me --,it's soybean fields in Mato Grosso in Brazil --,in order to feed us.,These are extraordinary landscapes,,but few of us ever get to see them. 
 And increasingly these landscapes,are not just feeding us either.,As more of us move into cities,,more of us are eating meat,,so that a third of the annual grain crop globally,now gets fed to animals,rather than to us human animals.,And given that it takes three times as much grain --,actually ten times as much grain --,to feed a human if it's passed through an animal first,,that's not a very efficient way of feeding us. 
 And it's an escalating problem too.,By 2050, it's estimated that twice the number,of us are going to be living in cities.,And it's also estimated that there is going to be twice as much,meat and dairy consumed.,So meat and urbanism are rising hand in hand.,And that's going to pose an enormous problem.,Six billion hungry carnivores to feed,,by 2050.,That's a big problem. And actually if we carry on as we are,,it's a problem we're very unlikely to be able to solve. 
 Nineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every year,to create new arable land.,Although at the same time we're losing an equivalent amount,of existing arables to salinization and erosion.,We're very hungry for fossil fuels too.,It takes about 10 calories to produce every calorie,of food that we consume in the West.,And even though there is food that we are producing at great cost,,we don't actually value it.,Half the food produced in the USA is currently thrown away.,And to end all of this, at the end of this long process,,we're not even managing to feed the planet properly.,A billion of us are obese, while a further billion starve.,None of it makes very much sense. 
 And when you think that 80 percent of global trade in food now,is controlled by just five multinational corporations,,it's a grim picture.,As we're moving into cities, the world is also embracing a Western diet.,And if we look to the future,,it's an unsustainable diet. 
 So how did we get here?,And more importantly, what are we going to do about it?,Well, to answer the slightly easier question first,,about 10,000 years ago, I would say,,is the beginning of this process,in the ancient Near East,,known as the Fertile Crescent.,Because, as you can see, it was crescent shaped.,And it was also fertile.,And it was here, about 10,000 years ago,,that two extraordinary inventions,,agriculture and urbanism, happened,roughly in the same place and at the same time. 
 This is no accident,,because agriculture and cities are bound together. They need each other.,Because it was discovery of grain,by our ancient ancestors for the first time,that produced a food source that was large enough,and stable enough to support permanent settlements.,And if we look at what those settlements were like,,we see they were compact.,They were surrounded by productive farm land,and dominated by large temple complexes,like this one at Ur,,that were, in fact, effectively,,spiritualized, central food distribution centers. 
 Because it was the temples that organized the harvest,,gathered in the grain, offered it to the gods,,and then offered the grain that the gods didn't eat back to the people.,So, if you like,,the whole spiritual and physical life of these cities,was dominated by the grain and the harvest,that sustained them.,And in fact, that's true of every ancient city.,But of course not all of them were that small.,Famously, Rome had about a million citizens,by the first century A.D.,So how did a city like this feed itself?,The answer is what I call "ancient food miles." 
 Basically, Rome had access to the sea,,which made it possible for it to import food from a very long way away.,This is the only way it was possible to do this in the ancient world,,because it was very difficult to transport food over roads,,which were rough.,And the food obviously went off very quickly.,So Rome effectively waged war,on places like Carthage and Egypt,just to get its paws on their grain reserves.,And, in fact, you could say that the expansion of the Empire,was really sort of one long, drawn out,militarized shopping spree, really.,(Laughter),In fact -- I love the fact, I just have to mention this:,Rome in fact used to import oysters from London,,at one stage. I think that's extraordinary. 
 So Rome shaped its hinterland,through its appetite.,But the interesting thing is that the other thing also,happened in the pre-industrial world.,If we look at a map of London in the 17th century,,we can see that its grain, which is coming in from the Thames,,along the bottom of this map.,So the grain markets were to the south of the city.,And the roads leading up from them,to Cheapside, which was the main market,,were also grain markets. 
 And if you look at the name of one of those streets,,Bread Street, you can tell,what was going on there 300 years ago.,And the same of course was true for fish.,Fish was, of course, coming in by river as well. Same thing.,And of course Billingsgate, famously, was London's fish market,,operating on-site here until the mid-1980s.,Which is extraordinary, really, when you think about it.,Everybody else was wandering around,with mobile phones that looked like bricks,and sort of smelly fish happening down on the port. 
 This is another thing about food in cities:,Once its roots into the city are established,,they very rarely move.,Meat is a very different story,because, of course, animals could walk into the city.,So much of London's meat,was coming from the northwest,,from Scotland and Wales.,So it was coming in, and arriving at the city at the northwest,,which is why Smithfield,,London's very famous meat market, was located up there.,Poultry was coming in from East Anglia and so on, to the northeast.,I feel a bit like a weather woman doing this. Anyway,,and so the birds were coming in,with their feet protected with little canvas shoes.,And then when they hit the eastern end,of Cheapside, that's where they were sold,,which is why it's called Poultry. 
 And, in fact, if you look at the map of any city,built before the industrial age,,you can trace food coming in to it.,You can actually see how it was physically shaped by food,,both by reading the names of the streets, which give you a lot of clues.,Friday Street, in a previous life,,is where you went to buy your fish on a Friday.,But also you have to imagine it full of food.,Because the streets and the public spaces,were the only places where food was bought and sold. 
 And if we look at an image of Smithfield in 1830,you can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this,and be unaware of where your food came from.,In fact, if you were having Sunday lunch,,the chances were it was mooing or bleating outside your window,about three days earlier.,So this was obviously an organic city,,part of an organic cycle.,And then 10 years later everything changed. 
 This is an image of the Great Western in 1840.,And as you can see, some of the earliest train passengers,were pigs and sheep.,So all of a sudden, these animals are no longer walking into market.,They're being slaughtered out of sight and mind,,somewhere in the countryside.,And they're coming into the city by rail.,And this changes everything.,To start off with, it makes it possible,for the first time to grow cities,,really any size and shape, in any place.,Cities used to be constrained by geography;,they used to have to get their food through very difficult physical means.,All of a sudden they are effectively emancipated from geography. 
 And as you can see from these maps of London,,in the 90 years after the trains came,,it goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feed,by animals coming in on foot, and so on,,to a large splurge,,that would be very, very difficult to feed with anybody on foot,,either animals or people.,And of course that was just the beginning. After the trains came cars,,and really this marks the end of this process.,It's the final emancipation of the city,from any apparent relationship with nature at all. 
 And this is the kind of city that's devoid of smell,,devoid of mess, certainly devoid of people,,because nobody would have dreamed of walking in such a landscape.,In fact, what they did to get food was they got in their cars,,drove to a box somewhere on the outskirts,,came back with a week's worth of shopping,,and wondered what on earth to do with it.,And this really is the moment when our relationship,,both with food and cities, changes completely. 
 Here we have food -- that used to be the center,,the social core of the city -- at the periphery.,It used to be a social event, buying and selling food.,Now it's anonymous.,We used to cook; now we just add water,,or a little bit of an egg if you're making a cake or something.,We don't smell food to see if it's okay to eat.,We just read the back of a label on a packet.,And we don't value food. We don't trust it.,So instead of trusting it, we fear it.,And instead of valuing it, we throw it away. 
 One of the great ironies of modern food systems,is that they've made the very thing they promised,to make easier much harder.,By making it possible to build cities anywhere and any place,,they've actually distanced us from our most important relationship,,which is that of us and nature.,And also they've made us dependent on systems that only they can deliver,,that, as we've seen, are unsustainable. 
 So what are we going to do about that?,It's not a new question.,500 years ago it's what Thomas More was asking himself.,This is the frontispiece of his book "Utopia.",And it was a series of semi-independent city-states,,if that sounds remotely familiar,,a day's walk from one another where everyone was basically farming-mad,,and grew vegetables in their back gardens,,and ate communal meals together, and so on.,And I think you could argue that,food is a fundamental ordering principle of Utopia,,even though More never framed it that way. 
 And here is another very famous "Utopian" vision,,that of Ebenezer Howard, "The Garden City.",Same idea: series of semi-independent city-states,,little blobs of metropolitan stuff with arable land around,,joined to one another by railway.,And again, food could be said to be,the ordering principle of his vision.,It even got built, but nothing to do with,this vision that Howard had.,And that is the problem with these Utopian ideas,,that they are Utopian. 
 Utopia was actually a word that Thomas Moore used deliberately.,It was a kind of joke, because it's got a double derivation from the Greek.,It can either mean a good place, or no place.,Because it's an ideal. It's an imaginary thing. We can't have it.,And I think, as a conceptual tool,for thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling,,that makes it not much use.,So I've come up with an alternative,,which is Sitopia, from the ancient Greek,,"sitos" for food, and "topos" for place. 
 I believe we already live in Sitopia.,We live in a world shaped by food,,and if we realize that, we can use food as a really powerful tool --,a conceptual tool, design tool, to shape the world differently.,So if we were to do that, what might Sitopia look like?,Well I think it looks a bit like this.,I have to use this slide. It's just the look on the face of the dog.,But anyway, this is -- (Laughter),it's food at the center of life,,at the center of family life, being celebrated,,being enjoyed, people taking time for it.,This is where food should be in our society. 
 But you can't have scenes like this unless you have people like this.,By the way, these can be men as well.,It's people who think about food,,who think ahead, who plan,,who can stare at a pile of raw vegetables,and actually recognize them.,We need these people. We're part of a network.,Because without these kinds of people we can't have places like this.,Here, I deliberately chose this because it is a man buying a vegetable.,But networks, markets where food is being grown locally.,It's common. It's fresh.,It's part of the social life of the city.,Because without that, you can't have this kind of place,,food that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape,,and is not just a zero-sum commodity,off in some unseen hell-hole.,Cows with a view.,Steaming piles of humus.,This is basically bringing the whole thing together. 
 And this is a community project,I visited recently in Toronto.,It's a greenhouse, where kids get told,all about food and growing their own food.,Here is a plant called Kevin, or maybe it's a,plant belonging to a kid called Kevin. I don't know.,But anyway, these kinds of projects,that are trying to reconnect us with nature is extremely important. 
 So Sitopia, for me, is really a way of seeing.,It's basically recognizing that Sitopia,already exists in little pockets everywhere.,The trick is to join them up,,to use food as a way of seeing.,And if we do that, we're going to stop seeing cities,as big, metropolitan, unproductive blobs, like this.,We're going to see them more like this,,as part of the productive, organic framework,of which they are inevitably a part,,symbiotically connected.,But of course, that's not a great image either,,because we need not to be producing food like this anymore.,We need to be thinking more about permaculture,,which is why I think this image just,sums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing.,It's a re-conceptualization,of the way food shapes our lives. 
 The best image I know of this is from 650 years ago.,It's Ambrogio Lorenzetti's "Allegory of Good Government.",It's about the relationship between the city and the countryside.,And I think the message of this is very clear.,If the city looks after the country,,the country will look after the city.,And I want us to ask now,,what would Ambrogio Lorenzetti paint,if he painted this image today?,What would an allegory of good government look like today?,Because I think it's an urgent question.,It's one we have to ask,,and we have to start answering.,We know we are what we eat.,We need to realize that the world is also what we eat.,But if we take that idea, we can use food,as a really powerful tool to shape the world better.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)Well, this is 2009.,And it's the Bicentenary of Charles Darwin.,And all over the world, eminent evolutionists,are anxious to celebrate this.,And what they're planning to do is to enlighten us,on almost every aspect,of Darwin and his life,,and how he changed our thinking.,I say almost every aspect,,because there is one aspect of this story,which they have thrown no light on.,And they seem anxious to skirt around it and step over it,and to talk about something else.,So I'm going to talk about it.,It's the question of, why are we so different from the chimpanzees? 
 We get the geneticists keeping on telling us,how extremely closely we are related -- hardly any genes of difference,,very, very closely related.,And yet, when you look at the phenotypes,,there's a chimp, there's a man;,they're astoundingly different,,no resemblance at all.,I'm not talking about airy-fairy stuff,about culture or psychology, or behavior.,I'm talking about ground-base, nitty-gritty,,measurable physical differences.,They, that one,,is hairy and walking on four legs.,That one is a naked biped. Why?,I mean --,(Laughter),if I'm a good Darwinist, I've got to believe,there's a reason for that.,If we changed so much, something must have happened.,What happened? 
 Now 50 years ago, that was a laughably simple question.,Everybody knew the answer.,They knew what happened.,The ancestor of the apes stayed in the trees;,our ancestors went out onto the plain.,That explained everything.,We had to get up on our legs to peer over the tall grass,,or to chase after animals,,or to free our hands for weapons.,And we got so overheated in the chase,that we had to take off that fur coat and throw it away.,Everybody knew that, for generations. 
 But then, in the '90s, something began to unravel.,The paleontologists themselves looked a bit more closely,at the accompanying microfauna,that lived in the same time and place as the hominids.,And they weren't savanna species.,And they looked at the herbivores. And they weren't savanna herbivores.,And then they were so clever, they found a way to analyze,fossilized pollen.,Shock, horror.,The fossilized pollen was not of savanna vegetation.,Some of it even came from lianas,,those things that dangle in the middle of the jungle. 
 So we're left with a situation where,we know that our earliest ancestors,were moving around on four legs in the trees,,before the savanna ecosystem even came into existence.,This is not something I've made up.,It's not a minority theory.,Everybody agrees with it. 
 Professor Tobias came over from South Africa,and spoke to University College London.,He said, "Everything I've been telling you for the last 20 years,,forget about it. It was wrong.,We've got to go back to square one and start again.",It made him very unpopular. They didn't want to go back to square one. 
 I mean, it's a terrible thing to happen.,You've got this beautiful paradigm.,You've believed it through generations.,Nobody has questioned it.,You've been constructing fanciful things on top of it,,relying on it to be as solid as a rock.,And now it's whipped away from under you.,What do you do? What does a scientist do in that case? 
 Well, we know the answer because,Thomas S. Kuhn,wrote a seminal treatise,about this back in 1962.,He said what scientists do,when a paradigm fails,is, guess what -- they carry on as if nothing had happened.,(Laughter),If they haven't got a paradigm they can't ask the question.,So they say, "Yes it's wrong,,but supposing it was right ...",(Laughter),And the only other option open to them,is to stop asking the questions.,So that is what they have done now.,That's why you don't hear them talking about it. It's yesterday's question. 
 Some of them have even elevated it into a principle.,It's what we ought to be doing.,Aaron Filler from Harvard said,,"Isn't it time we stopped talking about selective pressures?,I mean, why don't we talk about, well, there's chromosomes, and there's genes.,And we just record what we see.",Charles Darwin must be spinning in his grave!,He knew all about that kind of science.,And he called it hypothesis-free science.,And he despised it from the bottom of his heart.,And if you're going to say,,"I'm going to stop talking about selective pressures,",you can take "The Origin of Species" and throw it out of the window,,for it's about nothing else but selective pressures. 
 And the irony of it is,,that this is one occasion of a paradigm collapse,where we didn't have to wait for a new paradigm to come up.,There was one waiting in the wings.,It had been waiting there since 1960,when Alister Hardy, a marine biologist,,said, "I think what happened,,perhaps our ancestors,had a more aquatic existence,for some of the time.",He kept it to himself for 30 years.,But then the press got hold of it and all hell broke loose.,All his colleagues said, "This is outrageous.,You've exposed us to public ridicule!,You must never do that again.",And at that time, it became set in stone:,the aquatic theory should be dumped,with the UFOs and the yetis,,as part of the lunatic fringe of science. 
 Well I don't think that.,I think that Hardy had a lot going for him.,I'd like to talk about just a handful,of what have been called the,hallmarks of mankind,,the things that made us different from everybody else,,and all our relatives.,Let's look at our naked skin.,It's obvious that most of the things we think about,that have lost their body hair, mammals without body hair,,are aquatic ones, like the dugong, the walrus,,the dolphin, the hippopotamus, the manatee.,And a couple of wallowers-in-mud like the babirusa.,And you're tempted to think, well perhaps,,could that be why we are naked? 
 I suggested it and people said, "No no no.,I mean, look at the elephant.,You've forgotten all about the elephant haven't you?",So back in 1982 I said,,"Well perhaps the elephant had an aquatic ancestor.",Peals of merry laughter!,"That crazy woman. She's off again. She'll say anything won't she?",But by now, everybody agrees that the elephant had an aquatic ancestor.,This has come 'round to be that all those naked pachyderms,have aquatic ancestors.,The last exception was supposed to be the rhinoceros. 
 Last year in Florida they found extinct ancestor of a rhinoceros,and said, "Seems to have spent most of its time in the water.",So this is a close connection between nakedness and water.,As an absolute connection, it only works one way.,You can't say all aquatic animals are naked,,because look at the sea otter.,But you can say,that every animal that has become naked,has been conditioned by water, in its own lifetime,,or the lifetime of its ancestors. I think this is significant.,The only exception is the naked Somalian mole-rat,,which never puts its nose above the surface of the ground. 
 And take bipedality.,Here you can't find anybody to compare it with,,because we're the only animal that walks upright on two legs.,But you can say this: all the apes and all the monkeys,are capable of walking on two legs,,if they want to, for a short time.,There is only one circumstance in which they,always, all of them, walk on two legs,,and that is when they are wading through water.,Do you think that's significant?,David Attenborough thinks it's significant,,as the possible beginning of our bipedalism. 
 Look at the fat layer.,We have got, under our skin, a layer of fat, all over:,nothing in the least like that in any other primate.,Why should it be there?,Well they do know, that if you look at other aquatic mammals,,the fat that in most land mammals,is deposited inside the body wall,,around the kidneys and the intestines and so on,,has started to migrate to the outside,,and spread out in a layer inside the skin.,In the whale it's complete:,no fat inside at all, all in blubber outside.,We cannot avoid the suspicion,that in our case it's started to happen.,We have got skin lined with this layer.,It's the only possible explanation of why humans,,if they're very unlucky,,can become grossly obese,,in a way that would be totally impossible for any other primate, physically impossible.,Something very odd, matter-of-factly, never explained. 
 The question of why we can speak.,We can speak.,And the gorilla can't speak. Why?,Nothing to do with his teeth or his tongue or his lungs or anything like that --,purely has to do with its conscious control of its breath.,You can't even train a gorilla to say "Ah" on request.,The only creatures that have got conscious control of their breath,are the diving animals and the diving birds.,It was an absolute precondition for our being able to speak. 
 And then again, there is the fact that we are streamlined.,Trying to imagine a diver,diving into water -- hardly makes a splash.,Try to imagine a gorilla,performing the same maneuver,,and you can see that, compared with gorilla,,we are halfway to being shaped like a fish.,I am trying to suggest that, for 40-odd years,,this aquatic idea has been miscategorized as lunatic fringe,,and it is not lunatic fringe. 
 And the ironic thing about it is that,they are not staving off the aquatic theory,to protect a theory of their own,,which they've all agreed on, and they love.,There is nothing there.,They are staving off the aquatic theory,to protect a vacuum.,(Laughter),(Applause) 
 How do they react when I say these things?,One very common reaction I've heard about 20 times,is, "But it was investigated.,They conducted a serious investigation of this at the beginning,,when Hardy put forward his article.",I don't believe it.,For 35 years I've been looking for any evidence,of any incident of that kind,,and I've concluded that that's one of the urban myths.,It's never been done. 
 I ask people sometimes, and they say,,"I like the aquatic theory!,Everybody likes the aquatic theory.,Of course they don't believe it, but they like it.",Well I say, "Why do you think it's rubbish?",They say "Well ...,everybody I talk to says it's rubbish.,And they can't all be wrong, can they?",The answer to that, loud and clear, is, "Yes! They can all be wrong.",History is strewn with the cases when they've all got it wrong.,(Applause),And if you've got a scientific problem like that,,you can't solve it by holding a head count,,and saying, "More of us say yes than say no." 
 (Laughter) 
 Apart from that, some of the heads count more than others.,Some of them have come over.,There was Professor Tobias. He's come over.,Daniel Dennett, he's come over.,Sir David Attenborough, he's come over.,Anybody else out there? Come on in.,The water is lovely. 
 (Applause) 
 And now we've got to look to the future.,Ultimately one of three things is going to happen.,Either they will go on for the next 40 years, 50 years, 60 years.,"Yeah well we don't talk about that. Let's talk about something interesting.",That would be very sad.,The second thing that could happen,is that some young genius will arrive,,and say, "I've found it.,It was not the savanna, it was not the water, it was this!",No sign of that happening either.,I don't think there is a third option. 
 So the third thing that might happen is,a very beautiful thing.,If you look back at the early years of the last century,,there was a stand-off, a lot of bickering and bad feeling,between the believers in Mendel,,and the believers in Darwin.,It ended with a new synthesis:,Darwin's ideas and Mendel's ideas,blending together.,And I think the same thing will happen here.,You'll get a new synthesis.,Hardy's ideas and Darwin's ideas,will be blended together. 
 And we can move forward from there,,and really get somewhere.,That would be a beautiful thing.,It would be very nice for me if it happened soon.,(Laughter),Because I'm older now than George Burns was when he said,,"At my age, I don't even buy green bananas." 
 (Laughter) 
 So if it's going to come and it's going to happen,,what's holding it up?,I can tell you that in three words.,Academia says no.,They decided in 1960,,"That belongs with the UFOs and the yetis.",And it's not easy to change their minds.,The professional journals,won't touch it with a barge pole.,The textbooks don't mention it.,The syllabus doesn't mention even the fact that we're naked,,let alone look for a reason to it.,"Horizon," which takes its cue from the academics,,won't touch it with a barge pole.,So we never hear the case put for it,,except in jocular references,to people on the lunatic fringe. 
 I don't know quite where this diktat comes from.,Somebody up there,is issuing the commandment,,"Thou shalt not believe in the aquatic theory.,And if you hope to make progress in this profession,,and you do believe it, you'd better keep it to yourself,,because it will get in your way." 
 So I get the impression that some parts,of the scientific establishment,are morphing into a kind of priesthood.,But you know, that makes me feel good,,because Richard Dawkins has told us,how to treat a priesthood.,(Laughter),He says, "Firstly, you've got to refuse to give it,all the excessive awe and reverence,it's been trained to receive.",Right. I'll go ahead with that.,And secondly, he says,,"You must never be afraid to rock the boat.",I'll go along with that too.,Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)The substance of things unseen.,Cities, past and future.,In Oxford, perhapsnwe can use Lewis Carroll,and look in the looking glassnthat is New York City,to try and see our true selves,,or perhaps pass through to another world.,Or, in the words of F. Scott Fitzgerald,,"As the moon rose higher,,the inessential houses began to melt away,until gradually I becamenaware of the old island,here that once flowerednfor Dutch sailors' eyes,,a fresh green breast of the new world." 
 My colleagues and Inhave been working for 10 years,to rediscover this lost world,in a project we callnThe Mannahatta Project.,We're trying to discovernwhat Henry Hudson would have seen,on the afternoon of September 12th, 1609,,when he sailed into New York harbor.,And I'd like to tell younthe story in three acts,,and if I have time still, an epilogue. 
 So, Act I: A Map Found.,So, I didn't grow up in New York.,I grew up out west in thenSierra Nevada Mountains, like you see here,,in the Red Rock Canyon.,And from these earlynexperiences as a child,I learned to love landscapes.,And so when it became timenfor me to do my graduate studies,,I studied this emerging fieldnof landscape ecology.,Landscape ecology concerns itself,with how the stream and the meadownand the forest and the cliffs,make habitats for plants and animals.,This experience and this training,lead me to get a wonderful jobnwith the Wildlife Conservation Society,,which works to save wildlifenand wild places all over the world.,And over the last decade,,I traveled to over 40 countries,to see jaguars and bears and elephants,and tigers and rhinos. 
 But every time I would returnnfrom my trips I'd return back to New York City.,And on my weekends I would go up,njust like all the other tourists,,to the top of the Empire State Building,,and I'd look down on this landscape,non these ecosystems,,and I'd wonder, "How does this landscape,work to make habitatnfor plants and animals?,How does it work to make habitatnfor animals like me?",I'd go to Times Square and I'd looknat the amazing ladies on the wall,,and wonder why nobody is lookingnat the historical figures just behind them.,I'd go to Central Park and seenthe rolling topography of Central Park,come up against the abrupt and sheer,topography of midtown Manhattan. 
 I started reading about the historynand the geography in New York City.,I read that New York Citynwas the first mega-city,,a city of 10 million peoplenor more, in 1950.,I started seeing paintings like this.,For those of you who are from New York,,this is 125th streetnunder the West Side Highway.,(Laughter),It was once a beach.nAnd this painting,has John James Audubon,nthe painter, sitting on the rock.,And it's looking up on the wooded heightsnof Washington Heights,to Jeffrey's Hook, where the GeorgenWashington Bridge goes across today. 
 Or this painting, from the 1740s,nfrom Greenwich Village.,Those are two students at King's College --nlater Columbia University --,sitting on a hill, overlooking a valley.,And so I'd go down to GreenwichnVillage and I'd look for this hill,,and I couldn't find it.nAnd I couldn't find that palm tree.,What's that palm tree doing there?,(Laughter) 
 So, it was in the course of these investigationsnthat I ran into a map.,And it's this map you see here.,It's held in a geographic information system,which allows me to zoom in.,This map isn't from Hudson's time,nbut from the American Revolution,,170 years later, made bynBritish military cartographers,during the occupation of New York City.,And it's a remarkable map.nIt's in the National Archives here in Kew.,And it's 10 feet long andnthree and a half feet wide. 
 And if I zoom in to lower Manhattan,you can see the extentnof New York City as it was,,right at the end of the American Revolution.,Here's Bowling Green.nAnd here's Broadway.,And this is City Hall Park.,So the city basically extendednto City Hall Park.,And just beyond it you can see features,that have vanished,nthings that have disappeared.,This is the Collect Pond, which wasnthe fresh water source for New York City,for its first 200 years,,and for the Native Americansnfor thousands of years before that.,You can see the Lispenard Meadows,draining down through here,nthrough what is TriBeCa now,,and the beaches thatncome up from the Battery,,all the way to 42nd St. 
 This map was made for military reasons.,They're mapping the roads,nthe buildings, these fortifications,that they built.,But they're also mappingnthings of ecological interest,,also military interest: the hills,,the marshes, the streams.,This is Richmond Hill,nand Minetta Water,,which used to run its waynthrough Greenwich Village.,Or the swamp at Gramercy Park, right here.,Or Murray Hill.nAnd this is the Murrays' house,on Murray Hill, 200 years ago.,Here is Times Square,,the two streams that camentogether to make a wetland,in Times Square, as it wasnat the end of the American Revolution. 
 So I saw this remarkable map in a book.,And I thought to myself, "You know,nif I could georeference this map,,if I could place this mapnin the grid of the city today,,I could find these lost features,of the city,,in the block-by-blockngeography that people know,,the geography of where peoplengo to work, and where they go to live,,and where they like to eat.",So, after some worknwe were able to georeference it,,which allows us to putnthe modern streets on the city,,and the buildings, and the open spaces,,so that we can zoom innto where the Collect Pond is.,We can digitize the CollectnPond and the streams,,and see where they actually arenin the geography of the city today.,So this is funnfor finding where things are,relative to the old topography. 
 But I had another idea about this map.,If we take away the streets,nand if we take away the buildings,,and if we take away the open spaces,,then we could take this map.,If we pull off the 18th century features,we could drive it back in time.,We could drive it backnto its ecological fundamentals:,to the hills, to the streams,,to the basic hydrologynand shoreline, to the beaches,,the basic aspects thatnmake the ecological landscape. 
 Then, if we added mapsnlike the geology, the bedrock geology,,and the surface geology,nwhat the glaciers leave,,if we make the soil map,,with the 17 soil classes,,that are defined bynthe National Conservation Service,,if we make a digital elevation model,of the topographynthat tells us how high the hills were,,then we can calculate the slopes.,We can calculate the aspect.,We can calculate thenwinter wind exposure --,so, which way the winternwinds blow across the landscape.,The white areas on this mapnare the places protected from the winter winds. 
 We compiled all the informationnabout where the Native Americans were, the Lenape.,And we built a probability mapnof where they might have been.,So, the red areasnon this map indicate the places,that are best for humannsustainability on Manhattan,,places that are close to water,,places that are near the harbor to fish,,places protected from the winter winds.,We know that there was a Lenape settlement,down here by the Collect Pond.,And we knew that theynplanted a kind of horticulture,,that they grew these beautiful gardensnof corn, beans, and squash,,the "Three Sisters" garden. 
 So, we built a model that explainsnwhere those fields might have been.,And the old fields, the successional fields that go.,And we might think of these as abandoned.,But, in fact, they're grassland habitats,for grassland birds and plants.,And they have becomensuccessional shrub lands,,and these then mix innto a map of all the ecological communities.,And it turns out that Manhattannhad 55 different ecosystem types.,You can think of these as neighborhoods,,as distinctive as TriBeCanand the Upper East Side and Inwood --,that these are the forest and the wetlands,and the marine communities, the beaches. 
 And 55 is a lot. On a per-area basis,,Manhattan had more ecological communities,per acre than Yosemite does,,than Yellowstone, than Amboseli.,It was really an extraordinary landscape,that was capable of supportingnan extraordinary biodiversity. 
 So, Act II: A Home Reconstructed.,So, we studied the fish and the frogsnand the birds and the bees,,the 85 different kinds of fishnthat were on Manhattan,,the Heath hens, the speciesnthat aren't there anymore,,the beavers on all the streams,nthe black bears,,and the Native Americans,nto study how they used,and thought about their landscape.,We wanted to try and map these.nAnd to do that what we did,was we mapped their habitat needs. 
 Where do they get their food?,Where do they get their water?nWhere do they get their shelter?,Where do they get theirnreproductive resources?,To an ecologist, the intersectionnof these is habitat,,but to most people,nthe intersection of these is their home.,So, we would read in field guides,nthe standard field guides,that maybe you have on your shelves,,you know, what beavers need is,n"A slowly meandering stream,with aspen trees and alders and willows,,near the water."nThat's the best thing for a beaver. 
 So we just started making a list.,Here is the beaver.nAnd here is the stream,,and the aspen and the aldernand the willow.,As if these were the mapsnthat we would need,to predict where you would find the beaver.,Or the bog turtle, needing wet meadowsnand insects and sunny places.,Or the bobcat, needing rabbitsnand beavers and den sites.,And rapidly we started to realizenthat beavers can be,something that a bobcat needs.,But a beaver also needs things.nAnd that having it,on either side means thatnwe can link it together,,that we can create the network,of the habitat relationshipsnfor these species. 
 Moreover, we realizednthat you can start out,as being a beaver specialist,,but you can look up what an aspen needs.,An aspen needs fire and dry soils.,And you can look atnwhat a wet meadow needs.,And it need beaversnto create the wetlands,,and maybe some other things.,But you can also talknabout sunny places.,So, what does a sunny place need?nNot habitat per se.,But what are the conditionsnthat make it possible?,Or fire. Or dry soils.,And that you can put thesenon a grid that's 1,000 columns long,across the top and 1,000 rowsndown the other way.,And then we can visualizenthis data like a network,,like a social network. 
 And this is the networknof all the habitat relationships,of all the plants and animalsnon Manhattan,,and everything they needed,,going back to the geology,,going back to time and spacenat the very core of the web.,We call this the Muir Web.nAnd if you zoom in on it it looks like this.,Each point is a different species,or a different streamnor a different soil type.,And those little gray lines are the connectionsnthat connect them together.,They are the connectionsnthat actually make nature resilient.,And the structure of thisnis what makes nature work,,seen with all its parts.,We call these Muir Websnafter the Scottish-American naturalist,John Muir, who said, "When we trynto pick out anything by itself,,we find that it's bound fastnby a thousand invisible cords,that cannot be broken,nto everything in the universe." 
 So then we took the Muir websnand we took them back to the maps.,So if we wanted to go between 85th and 86th,,and Lex and Third,,maybe there was a stream in that block.,And these would be the kind of treesnthat might have been there,,and the flowers and the lichensnand the mosses,,the butterflies, the fish in the stream,,the birds in the trees.,Maybe a timber rattlesnake lived there.,And perhaps a black bear walked by.nAnd maybe Native Americans were there.,And then we took this data. 
 You can see this for yourselfnon our website.,You can zoom intonany block on Manhattan,,and see what might havenbeen there 400 years ago.,And we used it to trynand reveal a landscape,here in Act III.,We used the tools they use in Hollywood,to make these fantastic landscapesnthat we all see in the movies. 
 And we tried to use it to visualize Third Avenue.,So we would take the landscapenand we would build up the topography.,We'd lay on top of that the soils and the waters,nand illuminate the landscape.,We would lay on top of thatnthe map of the ecological communities.,And feed into that the map of the species.,So that we would actually take a photograph,,flying above Times Square,nlooking toward the Hudson River,,waiting for Hudson to come.,Using this technology, we can make these,fantastic georeferenced views.,We can basically take a picturenout of any window,on Manhattan and see what that landscapenlooked like 400 years ago. 
 This is the view from the East River,nlooking up Murray Hill,at where the United Nations is today.,This is the view lookingndown the Hudson River,,with Manhattan on the left,nand New Jersey out on the right,,looking out toward the Atlantic Ocean.,This is the view over Times Square,,with the beaver pond there,nlooking out toward the east.,So we can see the Collect Pond,nand Lispenard Marshes back behind.,We can see the fieldsnthat the Native Americans made.,And we can see thisnin the geography of the city today.,So when you're watching "Law and Order,"nand the lawyers walk up the steps,they could have walkednback down those steps,of the New York Court House,nright into the Collect Pond,,400 years ago. 
 So these images are the worknof my friend and colleague,,Mark Boyer, who is herenin the audience today.,And I'd just like, if you wouldngive him a hand,,to call out for his fine work.,(Applause) 
 There is such power in bringingnscience and visualization together,,that we can create images like this,,perhaps looking on eithernside of a looking glass.,And even though I've onlynhad a brief time to speak,,I hope you appreciate thatnMannahatta was a very special place.,The place that you see herenon the left side,was interconnected.nIt was based on this diversity.,It had this resilience that isnwhat we need in our modern world. 
 But I wouldn't have you thinknthat I don't like the place,on the right, which I quite do.nI've come to love the city,and its kind of diversity,nand its resilience,,and its dependence on densitynand how we're connected together.,In fact, that I see themnas reflections of each other,,much as Lewis Carroll didnin "Through the Looking Glass.",We can compare these two and hold themnin our minds at the same time,,that they really are the same place,,that there is no way that citiesncan escape from nature.,And I think this is what we're learningnabout building cities in the future. 
 So if you'll allow me a brief epilogue,nnot about the past,,but about 400 years from now,,what we're realizing is that,cities are habitats for people,,and need to supply what people need:,a sense of home, food, water, shelter,,reproductive resources,nand a sense of meaning.,This is the particular additionalnhabitat requirement of humanity.,And so many of the talks herenat TED are about meaning,,about bringing meaning to our lives,in all kinds of different ways, through technology,,through art, through science,,so much so that I thinknwe focus so much on,that side of our lives,nthat we haven't given enough,attention to the food and the waternand the shelter,,and what we need to raise the kids. 
 So, how can we envisionnthe city of the future?,Well, what if we gonto Madison Square Park,,and we imagine it without all the cars,,and bicycles instead,and large forests, and streams insteadnof sewers and storm drains?,What if we imagined the Upper East Side,with green roofs, and streamsnwinding through the city,,and windmills supplyingnthe power we need?,Or if we imagine the New YorknCity metropolitan area,,currently home to 12 million people,,but 12 million people in the future,nperhaps living at the density of Manhattan,,in only 36 percent of the area,,with the areas in betweenncovered by farmland,,covered by wetlands,,covered by the marshes we need. 
 This is the kind of future I think we need,,is a future that has the same diversity,and abundance and dynamism of Manhattan,,but that learns from thensustainability of the past,,of the ecology, the original ecology,nof nature with all its parts.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)Chris Anderson: Thank younso much, Prime Minister,,that was both fascinatingnand quite inspiring.,So, you're calling for a global ethic.,Would you describe thatnas global citizenship?,Is that an idea that you believe in,nand how would you define that? 
 Gordon Brown: It isnabout global citizenship,and recognizingnour responsibilities to others.,There is so much to donover the next few years,that is obvious to so many of us,to build a better world.,And there is so much shared sensenof what we need to do,,that it is vitalnthat we all come together.,But we don't necessarily haventhe means to do so. 
 So there are challenges to be met.,I believe the conceptnof global citizenship,will simply grow out of people talkingnto each other across continents.,But of course the tasknis to create the institutions,that make that global society work.,But I don't think we should underestimate,the extent to whichnmassive changes in technology,make possible the linking upnof people across the world. 
 CA: But people get excitednabout this idea of global citizenship,,but then they get confused a bit again,when they start thinking about patriotism,,and how to combine these two.,I mean, you're elected as Prime Minister,with a brief to bat for Britain.,How do you reconcile the two things? 
 GB: Well, of course national identitynremains important.,But it's not at the expense of peoplenaccepting their global responsibilities.,And I think onenof the problems of recession,is that people become more protectionist,,they look in on themselves,,they try to protect their own nation,,perhaps at the expense of other nations.,When you actually looknat the motor of the world economy,,it cannot move forward,unless there is tradenbetween the different countries.,And any nation that would becomenprotectionist over the next few years,would deprive itself of the chancenof getting the benefits,of growth in the world economy. 
 So, you've got to havena healthy sense of patriotism;,that's absolutely important.,But you've got to realizenthat this world has changed fundamentally,,and the problems we have cannot be solvednby one nation and one nation alone. 
 CA: Well, indeed.,But what do you donwhen the two come into conflict,and you're forced to make a decision,that either is in Britain's interest,nor the interest of Britons,,or citizens elsewhere in the world? 
 GB: Well I think we can persuade people,that what is necessarynfor Britain's long-term interests,,what is necessarynfor America's long-term interests,,is proper engagementnwith the rest of the world,,and taking the action that is necessary. 
 There is a great story, again,ntold about Richard Nixon.,1958, Ghana becomes independent,,so it is just over 50 years ago.,Richard Nixon goes to representnthe United States government,at the celebrationsnfor independence in Ghana.,And it's one of his first outingsnas Vice President to an African country.,He doesn't quite know what to do,,so he starts going around the crowd,and starts talking to people,and he says to peoplenin this rather unique way,,"How does it feel to be free?",And he's going around,n"How does it feel to be free?","How does it feel to be free?",And then someone says,,"How should I know? I come from Alabama." 
 (Laughter) 
 And that was the 1950s.,Now, what is remarkable,is that civil rights in Americanwere achieved in the 1960s.,But what is equally remarkable,is socioeconomic rights in Africanhave not moved forward very fast,even since the age of colonialism.,And yet, America and Africanhave got a common interest.,And we have got to realizenthat if we don't link up,with those people who are sensible voicesnand democratic voices in Africa,,to work together for common causes,,then the danger of Al Qaedanand related groups,making progress in Africa is very big. 
 So, I would say that what seems sometimes,to be altruism, in relation to Africa,nor in relation to developing countries,,is more than that.,It is enlightened self-interestnfor us to work with other countries.,And I would say that national interest,and, if you like,nwhat is the global interest,to tackle poverty and climate change,do, in the long run, come together.,And whatever the short-run pricenfor taking action on climate change,or on security, or taking actionnto provide opportunities,for people for education,,these are prices that are worth paying,so that you buildna stronger global society,where people feel able to feelncomfortable with each other,and are able to communicatenwith each other in such a way,that you can actually build strongernlinks between different countries. 
 CA: I still just want to drawnout on this issue.,So, you're on vacation at a nice beach,,and word comes throughnthat there's been a massive earthquake,and that there is a tsunaminadvancing on the beach.,One end of the beach, there is a housencontaining a family of five Nigerians.,And at the other end of the beachnthere is a single Brit.,You have time to -- 
 (Laughter) 
 you have time to alert one house.,What do you do? 
 (Laughter) 
 GB: Modern communications. 
 (Applause) 
 Alert both. 
 (Applause) 
 I do agree that my responsibility,is first of all to make surenthat people in our country are safe.,And I wouldn't like anythingnthat is said today to suggest,that I am diminishing the importancenof the responsibility,that each leadernhas for their own country. 
 But I'm trying to suggestnthat there is a huge opportunity,open to us that was nevernopen to us before.,But the power to communicatenacross borders,allows us to organizenthe world in a different way.,And I think, look at the tsunami,nit's a classic example.,Where was the early warning systems?,Where was the world acting together,to deal with the problemsnthat they knew arose,from the potential for earthquakes,,as well as the potentialnfor climate change?,And when the worldnstarts to work together,,with better early-warning systems,,you can deal with somenof these problems in a better way.,I just think we're not seeing,nat the moment,,the huge opportunities open to usnby the ability of people to cooperate,in a world where eithernthere was isolationism before,or there was limited alliancesnbased on convenience,which never actually took you to dealnwith some of the central problems. 
 CA: But I think this is the frustration,that perhaps a lot of people have,nlike people in the audience here,,where we love the kind of languagenthat you're talking about.,It is inspiring.,A lot of us believenthat that has to be the world's future.,And yet, when the situation changes,,you suddenly hearnpoliticians talking as if,,you know, for example,nthe life of one American soldier,is worth countless numbersnof Iraqi civilians.,When the pedal hits the metal,,the idealism can get moved away.,I'm just wondering whethernyou can see that changing over time,,whether you see in Britain,that there are changing attitudes,,and that people are actuallynmore supportive,of the kind of global ethicnthat you talk about. 
 GB: I think every religion, every faith,,and I'm not just talking herento people of faith or religion --,it has this global ethicnat the center of its credo.,And whether it's Jewishnor whether it's Muslim,or whether it's Hindu,nor whether it's Sikh,,the same global ethic is at the heartnof each of these religions.,So, I think you're dealing with something,that people instinctivelynsee as part of their moral sense.,So you're building on somethingnthat is not pure self-interest.,You're buildingnon people's ideas and values --,that perhaps they're candlesnthat burn very dimly on certain occasions.,But it is a set of values that cannot,nin my view, be extinguished. 
 Then the question is,,how do you make that change happen?,How do you persuade peoplenthat it is in their interest,to build strong --,After the Second World War,,we built institutions, the United Nations,,the IMF, the World Bank,,the World Trade Organization,nthe Marshall Plan.,There was a period in which peoplentalked about an act of creation,,because these institutions were so new.,But they are now out of date.nThey don't deal with the problems.,You can't dealnwith the environmental problem,through existing institutions.,You can't deal with the security problemnin the way that you need to.,You can't deal with the economicnand financial problem.,So we have got to rebuildnour global institutions,,build them in a way that is suitablento the challenges of this time. 
 And I believe that if you looknat the biggest challenge we face,,it is to persuade peoplento have the confidence,that we can build a truly global society,with the institutionsnthat are founded on these rules.,So, I come back to my initial point.,Sometimes you think things are impossible.,Nobody would have said 50 years ago,that apartheid would have gone in 1990,,or that the Berlin wall would have fallennat the turn of the '80s and '90s,,or that polio could be eradicated,,or perhaps 60 years ago,,nobody would have saidna man could gone to the Moon.,All these things have happened.,By tackling the impossible,nyou make the impossible possible. 
 CA: And we have had a speakernwho said that very thing,,and swallowed a sword rightnafter that, which was quite dramatic. 
 (Laughter) 
 GB: Followed my sword and swallow. 
 CA: But, surely a true global ethicnis for someone to say,,"I believe that the lifenof every human on the planet,is worth the same, equal consideration,,regardless of nationality and religion.",And you have politicians who have --,you're elected.,In a way, you can't say that.,Even if, as a human being,nyou believe that,,you can't say that.,You're elected for Britain's interests. 
 GB: We have a responsibility to protect.,I mean look, 1918,nthe Treaty of Versailles,,and all the treaties before that,,the Treaty of Westphalianand everything else,,were about protectingnthe sovereign right of countries,to do what they want.,Since then, the world has moved forward,,partly as a result of what happenednwith the Holocaust,,and people's concernnabout the rights of individuals,within territoriesnwhere they need protection,,partly because of what we saw in Rwanda,,partly because of what we saw in Bosnia.,The idea of the responsibility to protect,all individuals who are in situationsnwhere they are at humanitarian risk,is now being established as a principlenwhich governs the world. 
 So, while I can't automatically say,that Britain will rush to the aidnof any citizen of any country, in danger,,I can say that Britain is in a position,where we're working with other countries,so that this ideanthat you have a responsibility,to protect people who are victimsnof either genocide or humanitarian attack,,is something that is acceptednby the whole world. 
 Now, in the end, that can only be achieved,if your international institutionsnwork well enough to be able to do so.,And that comes back to what the futurenrole of the United Nations,,and what it can do, actually is.,But, the responsibility to protectnis a new idea that is, in a sense,,taken over from the ideanof self-determination,as the principle governingnthe international community. 
 CA: Can you picture, in our lifetimes,,a politician ever going out on a platform,of the kind of full-form global ethic,nglobal citizenship?,And basically saying, "I believenthat all people across the planet,have equal consideration,,and if in power we will act in that way.,And we believe that the peoplenof this country,are also now global citizensnand will support that ethic." 
 GB: Is that not what we're doingnin the debate about climate change?,We're saying that you cannot solve,the problem of climate changenin one country;,you've got to involve all countries.,You're saying that you must, and you havena duty to help those countries,that cannot afford to deal withnthe problems of climate change themselves.,You're saying you want a deal,with all the differentncountries of the world,where we're all bound together,to cutting carbon emissions in a waynthat is to the benefit of the whole world.,We've never had this beforenbecause Kyoto didn't work.,If you could get a deal at Copenhagen,nwhere people agreed,,A, that there was a long-term targetnfor carbon emission cuts,,B, that there was short-rangentargets that had to be met,so this wasn't just abstract;,it was people actuallynmaking decisions now,that would make a difference now,,and if you could then findna financing mechanism,that meant that the poorest countriesnthat had been hurt,by our inability to dealnwith climate change,over many, many years and decades,are given special help,so that they can movento energy-efficient technologies,,and they are in a position financially,to be able to affordnthe long-term investment,that is associatednwith cutting carbon emissions,,then you are treating the world equally,,by giving considerationnto every part of the planet,and the needs they have. 
 It doesn't mean that everybodyndoes exactly the same thing,,because we've actually gotnto do more financially,to help the poorest countries,,but it does meannthere is equal consideration,for the needs of citizensnin a single planet. 
 CA: Yes.,And then of course the theorynis still that those talks get rent apart,by different countries fightingnover their own individual interests. 
 GB: Yes, but I thinknEurope has got a position,,which is 27 countries havenalready come together.,I mean, the great difficulty in Europe,is if you're at a meetingnand 27 people speak,,it takes a very, very long time.,But we did get an agreementnon climate change.,America has madenits first disposition on this,with the bill that President Obamanshould be congratulated,for getting through Congress.,Japan has made an announcement.,China and India have signed upnto the scientific evidence.,And now we've got to move them to accept,a long-term target,nand then short-term targets.,But more progress has been made,nI think, in the last few weeks,than had been made for some years. 
 And I do believenthat there is a strong possibility,that if we work together, we can getnthat agreement to Copenhagen.,I certainly have beennputting forward proposals,that would have allowednthe poorest parts of the world,to feel that we have taken into accountntheir specific needs.,And we would help them adapt.,And we would help them makenthe transition to a low-carbon economy. 
 I do think a reform of the internationalninstitutions is vital to this.,When the IMF was created in the 1940s,,it was created with resources that werenfive percent or so of the world's GDP.,The IMF now has limitednresources, one percent.,It can't really make the difference,that ought to be madenin a period of crisis.,So, we've got to rebuildnthe world institutions.,And that's a big task:,persuading all the different countries,with the different voting sharesnin these institutions to do so. 
 There is a story toldnabout the three world leaders,of the day getting a chancento get some advice from God.,And the story is toldnthat Bill Clinton went to God,and he asked when there will bensuccessful climate change,and a low-carbon economy.,And God shook his head and said,,"Not this year, not this decade,nperhaps not even in [your] lifetime.",And Bill Clinton walked away in tears,because he had failednto get what he wanted. 
 And then the story is that Barroso,nthe president of the European Commission,,went to God and he asked,,"When will we getna recovery of global growth?",And God said, "Not this year,nnot in this decade,,perhaps not in your lifetime.",So Barroso walked awayncrying and in tears. 
 And then the Secretary-Generalnof the United Nations,came up to speak to God and said,,"When will our internationalninstitutions work?",And God cried. 
 (Laughter) 
 It is very important to recognizenthat this reform of institutions,is the next stage afternagreeing upon ourselves,that there is a clear ethicnupon which we can build. 
 CA: Prime Minister, I thinknthere are many in the audience,who are truly appreciativenof the efforts you made,in terms of the financial messnwe got ourselves into.,And there are certainlynmany people in the audience,who will be cheering you on as you seeknto advance this global ethic. 
 Thank you so much for coming to TED.

 ♫ Just going to sweat it out? ♫ 
 ♫ Wait it out ♫,(Applause)If I could reveal anything,that is hidden from us,,at least in modern cultures,,it would be to reveal something that we've forgotten,,that we used to know,as well as we knew our own names.,And that is that we live in a competent universe,,that we are part of a brilliant planet,,and that we are surrounded by genius. 
 Biomimicry is a new discipline,that tries to learn from those geniuses,,and take advice from them, design advice.,That's where I live,,and it's my university as well.,I'm surrounded by genius. I cannot help but,remember the organisms and the ecosystems,that know how to live here gracefully on this planet.,This is what I would tell you to remember,if you ever forget this again.,Remember this.,This is what happens every year.,This is what keeps its promise.,While we're doing bailouts, this is what happened.,Spring. 
 Imagine designing spring.,Imagine that orchestration.,You think TED is hard to organize. (Laughter) Right?,Imagine, and if you haven't done this in a while, do.,Imagine the timing, the coordination,,all without top-down laws,,or policies, or climate change protocols.,This happens every year.,There is lots of showing off.,There is lots of love in the air.,There's lots of grand openings.,And the organisms, I promise you,,have all of their priorities in order. 
 I have this neighbor that keeps me in touch with this,,because he's living, usually on his back,,looking up at those grasses.,And one time he came up to me --,he was about seven or eight years old -- he came up to me.,And there was a wasp's nest,that I had let grow in my yard,,right outside my door.,And most people knock them down when they're small.,But it was fascinating to me,,because I was looking at this sort of fine Italian end papers.,And he came up to me and he knocked.,He would come every day with something to show me.,And like, knock like a woodpecker on my door until I opened it up.,And he asked me,how I had made the house for those wasps,,because he had never seen one this big.,And I told him, "You know, Cody,,the wasps actually made that.",And we looked at it together.,And I could see why he thought,,you know -- it was so beautifully done.,It was so architectural. It was so precise. 
 But it occurred to me, how in his small life,had he already believed the myth,that if something was that well done,,that we must have done it.,How did he not know --,it's what we've all forgotten --,that we're not the first ones to build.,We're not the first ones to process cellulose.,We're not the first ones to make paper. We're not the first ones,to try to optimize packing space,,or to waterproof, or to try to heat and cool a structure.,We're not the first ones to build houses for our young. 
 What's happening now, in this field called biomimicry,,is that people are beginning to remember,that organisms, other organisms,,the rest of the natural world,,are doing things very similar to what we need to do.,But in fact they are doing them in a way,that have allowed them to live gracefully on this planet,for billions of years.,So these people, biomimics,,are nature's apprentices.,And they're focusing on function.,What I'd like to do is show you a few of the things,that they're learning.,They have asked themselves,,"What if, every time I started to invent something,,I asked, 'How would nature solve this?'" 
 And here is what they're learning.,This is an amazing picture from a Czech photographer named Jack Hedley.,This is a story about an engineer at J.R. West.,They're the people who make the bullet train.,It was called the bullet train,because it was rounded in front,,but every time it went into a tunnel,it would build up a pressure wave,,and then it would create like a sonic boom when it exited.,So the engineer's boss said,,"Find a way to quiet this train." 
 He happened to be a birder.,He went to the equivalent of an Audubon Society meeting.,And he studied -- there was a film about king fishers.,And he thought to himself, "They go from one density of medium,,the air, into another density of medium, water,,without a splash. Look at this picture.,Without a splash, so they can see the fish.,And he thought, "What if we do this?",Quieted the train.,Made it go 10 percent faster on 15 percent less electricity. 
 How does nature repel bacteria?,We're not the first ones to have to protect ourselves,from some bacteria.,Turns out that -- this is a Galapagos Shark.,It has no bacteria on its surface, no fouling on its surface, no barnacles.,And it's not because it goes fast.,It actually basks. It's a slow-moving shark.,So how does it keep its body free of bacteria build-up?,It doesn't do it with a chemical.,It does it, it turns out, with the same denticles,that you had on Speedo bathing suits,,that broke all those records in the Olympics, 
 but it's a particular kind of pattern.,And that pattern, the architecture of that pattern,on its skin denticles,keep bacteria from being able to land and adhere.,There is a company called Sharklet Technologies,that's now putting this on the surfaces in hospitals,to keep bacteria from landing,,which is better than dousing it with anti-bacterials or harsh cleansers,that many, many organisms are now becoming drug resistant.,Hospital-acquired infections are now killing,more people every year in the United States,than die from AIDS or cancer or car accidents combined --,about 100,000. 
 This is a little critter that's in the Namibian desert.,It has no fresh water that it's able to drink,,but it drinks water out of fog.,It's got bumps on the back of its wing covers.,And those bumps act like a magnet for water.,They have water-loving tips, and waxy sides.,And the fog comes in and it builds up on the tips.,And it goes down the sides and goes into the critter's mouth.,There is actually a scientist here at Oxford,who studied this, Andrew Parker.,And now kinetic and architectural firms like Grimshaw,are starting to look at this as a way,of coating buildings,so that they gather water from the fog.,10 times better than our fog-catching nets. 
 CO2 as a building block.,Organisms don't think of CO2 as a poison.,Plants and organisms that make shells,,coral, think of it as a building block.,There is now a cement manufacturing company,starting in the United States called Calera.,They've borrowed the recipe from the coral reef,,and they're using CO2 as a building block,in cement, in concrete.,Instead of -- cement usually,emits a ton of CO2 for every ton of cement.,Now it's reversing that equation,,and actually sequestering half a ton of CO2,thanks to the recipe from the coral. 
 None of these are using the organisms.,They're really only using the blueprints or the recipes,from the organisms.,How does nature gather the sun's energy?,This is a new kind of solar cell,that's based on how a leaf works.,It's self-assembling.,It can be put down on any substrate whatsoever.,It's extremely inexpensive,and rechargeable every five years.,It's actually a company a company that I'm involved in called OneSun,,with Paul Hawken. 
 There are many many ways that nature filters water,that takes salt out of water.,We take water and push it against a membrane.,And then we wonder why the membrane clogs,and why it takes so much electricity.,Nature does something much more elegant.,And it's in every cell.,Every red blood cell of your body right now,has these hourglass-shaped pores,called aquaporins.,They actually export water molecules through.,It's kind of a forward osmosis.,They export water molecules through,,and leave solutes on the other side.,A company called Aquaporin is starting to make desalination,membranes mimicking this technology. 
 Trees and bones are constantly reforming themselves,along lines of stress.,This algorithm has been put into a software program,that's now being used to make bridges lightweight,,to make building beams lightweight.,Actually G.M. Opel used it,to create that skeleton you see,,in what's called their bionic car.,It lightweighted that skeleton using a minimum amount of material,,as an organism must,,for the maximum amount of strength. 
 This beetle, unlike this chip bag here,,this beetle uses one material, chitin.,And it finds many many ways,to put many functions into it.,It's waterproof.,It's strong and resilient.,It's breathable. It creates color through structure.,Whereas that chip bag has about seven layers to do all of those things.,One of our major inventions,that we need to be able to do,to come even close to what these organisms can do,is to find a way,to minimize the amount of material, the kind of material we use,,and to add design to it.,We use five polymers in the natural world,to do everything that you see.,In our world we use about 350 polymers,to make all this. 
 Nature is nano.,Nanotechnology, nanoparticles, you hear a lot of worry about this.,Loose nanoparticles. What is really interesting to me,is that not many people have been asking,,"How can we consult nature about how to make nanotechnology safe?",Nature has been doing that for a long time.,Embedding nanoparticles in a material for instance, always.,In fact, sulfur-reducing bacteria,,as part of their synthesis,,they will emit, as a byproduct,,nanoparticles into the water.,But then right after that, they emit a protein,that actually gathers and aggregates those nanoparticles,so that they fall out of solution. 
 Energy use. Organisms sip energy,,because they have to work or barter for every single bit that they get.,And one of the largest fields right now,,in the world of energy grids,,you hear about the smart grid.,One of the largest consultants are the social insects.,Swarm technology. There is a company called Regen.,They are looking at how ants and bees,find their food and their flowers,in the most effective way,as a whole hive.,And they're having appliances in your home,talk to one another through that algorithm,,and determine how to minimize peak power use. 
 There's a group of scientists in Cornell,that are making what they call a synthetic tree,,because they are saying, "There is no pump at the bottom of a tree.",It's capillary action and transpiration pulls,water up, a drop at a time,,pulling it, releasing it from a leaf and pulling it up through the roots.,And they're creating -- you can think of it as a kind of wallpaper.,They're thinking about putting it on the insides of buildings,to move water up without pumps. 
 Amazon electric eel -- incredibly endangered,,some of these species --,create 600 volts of electricity,with the chemicals that are in your body.,Even more interesting to me is that,600 volts doesn't fry it.,You know we use PVC, and we sheath wires,with PVC for insulation.,These organisms, how are they insulating,against their own electric charge?,These are some questions that we've yet to ask. 
 Here's a wind turbine manufacturer that went to a whale.,Humpback whale has scalloped edges on its flippers.,And those scalloped edges,play with flow in such a way,that is reduces drag by 32 percent.,These wind turbines can rotate in incredibly slow windspeeds, as a result. 
 MIT just has a new radio chip,that uses far less power than our chips.,And it's based on the cochlear of your ear,,able to pick up internet, wireless, television signals,and radio signals, in the same chip.,Finally, on an ecosystem scale. 
 At Biomimicry Guild, which is my consulting company,,we work with HOK Architects.,We're looking at building whole cities,in their planning department.,And what we're saying is that,,shouldn't our cities do at least as well,,in terms of ecosystem services,,as the native systems that they replace?,So we're creating something called Ecological Performance Standards,that hold cities to this higher bar. 
 The question is -- biomimicry is an incredibly powerful,way to innovate.,The question I would ask is, "What's worth solving?",If you haven't seen this, it's pretty amazing.,Dr. Adam Neiman.,This is a depiction of,all of the water on Earth,in relation to the volume of the Earth --,all the ice, all the fresh water, all the sea water --,and all the atmosphere that we can breathe, in relation to the volume of the Earth.,And inside those balls,life, over 3.8 billion years,,has made a lush, livable place for us. 
 And we are in a long, long line,of organisms,to come to this planet and ask ourselves,,"How can we live here gracefully over the long haul?",How can we do what life has learned to do?,Which is to create conditions conducive to life.,Now in order to do this, the design challenge,of our century, I think,,we need a way to remind ourselves of those geniuses,,and to somehow meet them again. 
 One of the big ideas, one of the big projects,I've been honored to work on,is a new website. And I would encourage you all to please go to it.,It's called AskNature.org.,And what we're trying to do, in a TEDesque way,,is to organize all biological information,by design and engineering function. 
 And we're working with EOL, Encyclopedia of Life,,Ed Wilson's TED wish.,And he's gathering all biological information,on one website.,And the scientists who are contributing to EOL are answering a question,,"What can we learn from this organism?",And that information will go into AskNature.org.,And hopefully, any inventor, anywhere in the world,,will be able, in the moment of creation,,to type in, "How does nature remove salt from water?",And up will come mangroves, and sea turtles,and your own kidneys. 
 And we'll begin to,be able to,do as Cody does,,and actually be in touch,with these incredible models,,these elders that have been here,far, far longer than we have.,And hopefully, with their help,,we'll learn how to live on this Earth,,and on this home that is ours, but not ours alone.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)My name is Jonathan Zittrain,,and in my recent work I've been a bit of a pessimist.,So I thought this morning I would try to be the optimist,,and give reason to hope,for the future of the Internet,by drawing upon its present. 
 Now, it may seem like there is less hope today than there was before.,People are less kind. There is less trust around.,I don't know. As a simple example,,we could run a test here.,How many people have ever hitchhiked?,I know. How many people have hitchhiked,within the past 10 years?,Right. So what has changed?,It's not better public transportation.,So that's one reason to think that we might be,declensionists, going in the wrong direction. 
 But I want to give you three examples,to try to say that the trend line,is in fact in the other direction,,and it's the Internet helping it along.,So example number one: the Internet itself.,These are three of the founders of the Internet.,They were actually high school classmates together,at the same high school in suburban Los Angles in the 1960s.,You might have had a French club or a Debate club.,They had a "Let's build a global network" club,,and it worked out very well. 
 They are pictured here for their 25th anniversary,Newsweek retrospective on the Internet.,And as you can tell,,they are basically goof balls.,They had one great limitation,and one great freedom,as they tried to conceive of a global network.,The limitation was that they didn't have any money.,No particular amount of capital to invest,,of the sort that for a physical network,you might need for trucks and people,and a hub to move packages around overnight.,They had none of that. 
 But they had an amazing freedom,,which was they didn't have to make any money from it.,The Internet has no business plan, never did.,No CEO,,no firm responsible, singly, for building it.,Instead, it's folks getting together,to do something for fun,,rather than because they were told to,,or because they were expecting to make a mint off of it. 
 That ethos led to a network architecture,,a structure that was unlike,other digital networks then or since.,So unusual, in fact,,that it was said that it's not clear the Internet could work.,As late as 1992, IBM was known to say,you couldn't possibly build a corporate network,using Internet Protocol.,And even some Internet engineers today say,the whole thing is a pilot project and the jury is still out.,(Laughter) 
 That's why the mascot of Internet engineering,,if it had one, is said to be the bumblebee.,Because the fur-to-wingspan ratio of the bumblebee,is far too large for it to be able to fly.,And yet, mysteriously, somehow the bee flies.,I'm pleased to say that, thanks to massive government funding,,about three years ago we finally figured out,how bees fly.,(Laughter),It's very complicated, but it turns out they,flap their wings very quickly.,(Laughter) 
 So what is this bizarre architecture configuration,that makes the network sing and be so unusual?,Well, to move data around,from one place to another -- again, it's not like a package courier.,It's more like a mosh pit.,(Laughter),Imagine, you being part of a network,where, you're maybe at a sporting event,,and you're sitting in rows like this,,and somebody asks for a beer,,and it gets handed at the aisle.,And your neighborly duty,is to pass the beer along,,at risk to your own trousers,,to get it to the destination. 
 No one pays you to do this.,It's just part of your neighborly duty.,And, in a way, that's exactly how packets move around the Internet,,sometimes in as many as 25 or 30 hops,,with the intervening entities,that are passing the data around,having no particular contractual or legal obligation,to the original sender,or to the receiver. 
 Now, of course, in a mosh pit it's hard to specify a destination.,You need a lot of trust,,but it's not like, "I'm trying to get to Pensacola, please.",So the Internet needs addressing and directions.,It turns out there is no one overall map of the Internet.,Instead, again, it is as if we are all sitting together in a theater,,but we can only see amidst the fog,the people immediately around us.,So what do we do to figure out who is where?,We turn to the person on the right,,and we tell that person what we see on our left,,and vice versa.,And they can lather, rinse, repeat. And before you know it,,you have a general sense of where everything is. 
 This is how Internet addressing and routing actually work.,This is a system that relies on kindness and trust,,which also makes it very delicate and vulnerable.,In rare but striking instances,,a single lie told by just one entity,in this honeycomb,can lead to real trouble. 
 So, for example, last year,,the government of Pakistan,asked its Internet service providers there,to prevent citizens of Pakistan from seeing YouTube.,There was a video there that the government did not like,and they wanted to make sure it was blocked.,This is a common occurrence. Governments everywhere,are often trying to block,and filter and censor content on the Internet. 
 Well this one ISP in Pakistan,chose to effectuate the block for its subscribers,in a rather unusual way.,It advertised --,the way that you might be asked, if you were part of the Internet,,to declare what you see near you -- it advertised,that near it, in fact, it had suddenly awakened to find,that it was YouTube.,"That's right," it said, "I am YouTube.",Which meant that packets of data,from subscribers going to YouTube,stopped at the ISP, since they thought they were already there,,and the ISP threw them away unopened,because the point was to block it. 
 But it didn't stop there.,You see, that announcement,went one click out,,which got reverberated, one click out.,And it turns out that as you look,at the postmortem of this event,,you have at one moment,perfectly working YouTube.,Then, at moment number two,,you have the fake announcement go out.,And within two minutes,,it reverberates around,and YouTube is blocked everywhere in the world.,If you were sitting in Oxford, England, trying to get to YouTube,,your packets were going to Pakistan,and they weren't coming back. 
 Now just think about that.,One of the most popular websites in the world,,run by the most powerful company in the world,,and there was nothing that YouTube or Google,were particularly privileged to do about it.,And yet, somehow, within about two hours,,the problem was fixed.,How did this happen? 
 Well, for a big clue, we turn to NANOG.,The North American Network Operators Group,,a group of people who,,on a beautiful day outside,,enter into a windowless room,,at their terminals,reading email and messages,in fixed proportion font, like this,,and they talk about networks.,And some of them are mid-level employees at Internet service providers,around the world.,And here is the message where one of them says,,"Looks like we've got a live one. We have a hijacking of YouTube!,This is not a drill. It's not just the cluelessness,of YouTube engineers. I promise.,Something is up in Pakistan.",And they came together to help find the problem and fix it. 
 So it's kind of like if your house catches on fire.,The bad news is there is no fire brigade.,The good news is random people apparate from nowhere,,put out the fire and leave without expecting payment or praise.,(Applause),I was trying to think of the right model to describe,this form of random acts of kindness,by geeky strangers.,(Laughter),You know, it's just like the hail goes out,and people are ready to help.,And it turns out this model is everywhere, once you start looking for it. 
 Example number two: Wikipedia.,If a man named Jimbo came up to you in 2001,and said, "I've got a great idea! We start with seven articles,that anybody can edit anything, at any time,,and we'll get a great encyclopedia! Eh?",Right. Dumbest idea ever.,(Laughter),In fact, Wikipedia is an idea so profoundly stupid,that even Jimbo never had it. 
 Jimbo's idea was for Nupedia.,It was going to be totally traditional. He would pay people money,because he was feeling like a good guy,,and the money would go to the people,and they would write the articles.,The wiki was introduced,so others could make suggestions on edits --,as almost an afterthought, a back room.,And then it turns out the back room grew,to encompass the entire project. 
 And today, Wikipedia is so ubiquitous,that you can now find it on Chinese restaurant menus.,(Laughter),I am not making this up.,(Laughter),I have a theory I can explain later.,Suffice it to say for now that I prefer my Wikipedia,stir-fried with pimentos.,(Laughter) 
 But now, Wikipedia doesn't just spontaneously work.,How does it really work? It turns out,there is a back room that is kind of windowless,,metaphorically speaking.,And there are a bunch of people who, on a sunny day,,would rather be inside,and monitoring this, the administrator's notice board,,itself a wiki page that anyone can edit.,And you just bring your problems to the page.,It's reminiscent of the description of history,as "one damn thing after another," right? 
 Number one: "Tendentious editing by user Andyvphil.",Apologies, Andyvphil, if you're here today.,I'm not taking sides.,"Anon attacking me for reverting.",Here is my favorite: "A long story.",(Laughter),It turns out there are more people checking this page for problems,and wanting to solve them,than there are problems arising on the page. 
 And that's what keeps Wikipedia afloat.,At all times, Wikipedia is approximately,45 minutes away from utter destruction. Right?,There are spambots crawling it, trying to turn every article,into an ad for a Rolex watch.,(Laughter),It's this thin geeky line,that keeps it going.,Not because it's a job,,not because it's a career,,but because it's a calling.,It's something they feel impelled to do,because they care about it. 
 They even gather together in such groups,as the Counter-Vandalism Unit --,"Civility, Maturity, Responsibility" --,to just clean up the pages.,It does make you wonder if there were, for instance,,a massive, extremely popular Star Trek convention one weekend,,who would be minding the store?,(Laughter) 
 So what we see --,(Laughter),what we see in this phenomenon,is something that the crazed, late traffic engineer,Hans Monderman discovered in the Netherlands,,and here in South Kensington, that sometimes,if you remove some of the external rules and signs and everything else,,you can actually end up,with a safer environment in which people can function,,and one in which they are more human with each other.,They're realizing that they,have to take responsibility for what they do.,And Wikipedia has embraced this. 
 Some of you may remember Star Wars Kid,,the poor teenager who filmed himself with a golf ball retriever,,acting as if it were a light saber.,The film, without his permission or even knowledge at first,,found its way onto the Internet.,Hugely viral video. Extremely popular.,Totally mortifying to him. 
 Now, it being encyclopedic and all,,Wikipedia had to do an article about Star Wars Kid.,Every article on Wikipedia has a corresponding discussion page,,and on the discussion page,they had extensive argument among the Wikipedians,as to whether to have his real name,featured in the article.,You could see arguments on both sides.,Here is just a snapshot of some of them.,They eventually decided --,not unanimously by any means --,not to include his real name,,despite the fact that nearly all media reports did.,They just didn't think it was the right thing to do.,It was an act of kindness. 
 And to this day, the page for Star Wars Kid,has a warning right at the top,that says you are not to put his real name on the page.,If you do, it will be removed immediately,,removed by people who may have disagreed with the original decision,,but respect the outcome,and work to make it stay,because they believe in something bigger than their own opinion.,As a lawyer, I've got to say these guys are inventing the law,and stare decisis and stuff like that as they go along. 
 Now, this isn't just limited to Wikipedia.,We see it on blogs all over the place.,I mean, this is a 2005 Business Week cover.,Wow. Blogs are going to change your business.,I know they look silly. And sure they look silly.,They start off on all sorts of goofy projects. 
 This is my favorite goofy blog:,Catsthatlooklikehitler.com.,(Laughter),You send in a picture of your cat,if it looks like Hitler.,(Laughter),Yeah, I know. Number four, it's like, can you imagine,coming home to that cat everyday?,(Laughter) 
 But then, you can see the same kind of whimsy,applied to people.,So this is a blog devoted to unfortunate portraiture.,This one says, "Bucolic meadow with split-rail fence.,Is that an animal carcass behind her?",(Laughter),You're like, "You know? I think that's an animal carcass,behind her." 
 And it's one after the other.,But then you hit this one. Image removed at request of owner.,That's it. Image removed at request of owner.,It turns out that somebody lampooned here,wrote to the snarky guy that does the site,,not with a legal threat, not with an offer of payment,,but just said, "Hey, would you mind?",The person said, "No, that's fine." 
 I believe we can build architectures online,to make such human requests,that much easier to do,,to make it possible for all of us to see,that the data we encounter online,is just stuff on which to click and paste and copy and forward,that actually represents human emotion,and endeavor and impact,,and to be able to have an ethical moment,where we decide how we want to treat it. 
 I even think it can go into the real world.,We can end up, as we get in a world with more censors --,everywhere there is something filming you, maybe putting it online --,to be able to have a little clip you could wear,that says, "You know, I'd rather not.",And then have technology,that the person taking the photo will know later,,this person requested to be contacted,before this goes anywhere big,,if you don't mind.,And that person taking the photo can make a decision,about how and whether to respect it. 
 In the real world, we see filtering of this sort,taking place in Pakistan.,And we now have means that we can build, like this system,,so that people can report the filtering as they encounter it.,And it's no longer just a "I don't know. I couldn't get there. I guess I'll move on,",but suddenly a collective consciousness,about what is blocked and censored,where online.,In fact, talk about technology imitating life,imitating tech, or maybe it's the other way around. 
 An NYU researcher here took little cardboard robots,with smiley faces on them,,and a motor that just drove them forward,and a flag sticking out the back,with a desired destination.,It said, "Can you help me get there?",Released it on the streets of Manhattan.,(Laughter),They'll fund anything these days.,Here is the chart of over 43 people,helping to steer the robot that could not steer,and get it on its way, from one corner,from one corner of Washington Square Park,to another. 
 That leads to example number three: hitchhiking.,I'm not so sure hitchhiking is dead.,Why? There is the Craigslist rideshare board.,If it were called the Craigslist hitchhiking board,,tumbleweeds would be blowing through it.,But it's the rideshare board, and it's basically the same thing.,Now why are people using it?,I don't know. Maybe they think that, uh, killers don't plan ahead?,(Laughter),No. I think the actual answer is,that once you reframe it,,once you get out of one set of stale expectations,from a failed project that had its day,,but now, for whatever reason, is tarnished,,you can actually rekindle the kind of human kindness and sharing,that something like this on Craigslist represents. 
 And then you can highlight it,into something like,,yes, CouchSurfing.org.,CouchSurfing: one guy's idea,to, at last, put together people who are going somewhere far away,and would like to sleep on a stranger's couch for free,,with people who live far away,,and would like someone they don't know to sleep on their couch for free.,It's a brilliant idea.,It's a bee that, yes, flies. 
 Amazing how many successful couch surfings there have been.,And if you're wondering, no, there have been no known fatalities,associated with CouchSurfing.,Although, to be sure, the reputation system, at the moment,,works that you leave your report after the couch surfing experience,,so there may be some selection bias there.,(Laughter) 
 So, my urging, my thought,,is that the Internet isn't just a pile of information.,It's not a noun. It's a verb.,And when you go on it,,if you listen and see carefully and closely enough,,what you will discover,is that that information,is saying something to you.,What it's saying to you is what we heard yesterday,,Demosthenes was saying to us.,It's saying, "Let's march." Thank you very much.,(Applause)Good morning everybody.,I'd like to talk about a couple of things today.,The first thing is water.,Now I see you've all been enjoying the water,that's been provided for you here at the conference,,over the past couple of days.,And I'm sure you'll feel that it's from a safe source. 
 But what if it wasn't?,What if it was from a source like this?,Then statistics would actually say,that half of you would now be suffering,with diarrhea.,I talked a lot in the past about statistics,,and the provision of safe drinking water for all.,But they just don't seem to get through.,And I think I've worked out why.,It's because, using current thinking,,the scale of the problem,just seems too huge to contemplate solving.,So we just switch off:,us, governments and aid agencies.,Well, today, I'd like to show you,that through thinking differently,,the problem has been solved.,By the way, since I've been speaking,,another 13,000 people around the world,are suffering now with diarrhea.,And four children have just died. 
 I invented Lifesaver bottle,because I got angry.,I, like most of you, was sitting down, the day after Christmas in 2004,,when I was watching the devastating news,of the Asian tsunami as it rolled in,,playing out on TV.,The days and weeks that followed,,people fleeing to the hills,,being forced to drink contaminated water,or face death.,That really stuck with me.,Then, a few months later,,Hurricane Katrina slammed into the side of America.,"Okay," I thought, "here's a First World country, let's see what they can do.",Day one: nothing.,Day two: nothing.,Do you know it took five days to get water to the Superdome?,People were shooting each other on the streets,for TV sets and water.,That's when I decided I had to do something. 
 Now I spent a lot of time in my garage, over the next weeks and months,,and also in my kitchen -- much to the dismay of my wife. (Laughter),However, after a few failed prototypes,,I finally came up with this, the Lifesaver bottle. 
 Okay, now for the science bit.,Before Lifesaver, the best hand filters were only capable,of filtering down to about 200 nanometers.,The smallest bacteria is about 200 nanometers.,So a 200-nanometer bacteria,is going to get through a 200-nanometer hole.,The smallest virus, on the other hand,,is about 25 nanometers.,So that's definitely going to get through those 200 nanometer holes.,Lifesaver pores are 15 nanometers.,So nothing is getting through. 
 Okay, I'm going to give you a bit of a demonstration.,Would you like to see that?,I spent all the time setting this up, so I guess I should.,We're in the fine city of Oxford.,So -- someone's done that up.,Fine city of Oxford, so what I've done is I've gone,and got some water from the River Cherwell,,and the River Thames,,that flow through here. And this is the water.,But I got to thinking, you know,,if we were in the middle of a flood zone,in Bangladesh, the water wouldn't look like this.,So I've gone and got some stuff to add into it.,And this is from my pond. 
 (Sniffs) (Coughs) Have a smell of that, mister cameraman. 
 Okay. (Laughs) Right.,We're just going to pour that in there. 
 Audience: Ugh! 
 Michael Pritchard: Okay. We've got some runoff,from a sewage plant farm.,So I'm just going to put that in there.,(Laughter),Put that in there. There we go.,(Laughter),And some other bits and pieces, chuck that in there.,And I've got a gift here from a friend of mine's rabbit.,So we're just going to put that in there as well.,(Laughter),Okay. (Laughter) Now. 
 The Lifesaver bottle works really simply.,You just scoop the water up.,Today I'm going to use a jug,just to show you all. Let's get a bit of that poo in there.,That's not dirty enough. Let's just stir that up a little bit.,Okay, so I'm going to take this really filthy water,,and put it in here. Do you want a drink yet?,(Laughter),Okay. There we go.,Replace the top.,Give it a few pumps. Okay?,That's all that's necessary.,Now as soon as I pop the teat,,sterile drinking water is going to come out.,I've got to be quick. Okay, ready?,There we go. Mind the electrics.,That is safe, sterile drinking water.,(Applause),Cheers.,(Applause),There you go Chris.,(Applause),What's it taste of? 
 Chris Anderson: Delicious. 
 Michael Pritchard: Okay.,Let's see Chris's program throughout the rest of the show. Okay?,(Laughter) 
 Okay. Lifesaver bottle is used by thousands of people around the world.,It'll last for 6,000 liters.,And when it's expired, using failsafe technology,,the system will shut off, protecting the user.,Pop the cartridge out. Pop a new one in.,It's good for another 6,000 liters. 
 So let's look at the applications.,Traditionally, in a crisis, what do we do?,We ship water.,Then, after a few weeks, we set up camps.,And people are forced to come into the camps to get their safe drinking water.,What happens when 20,000 people congregate in a camp?,Diseases spread. More resources are required.,The problem just becomes self-perpetuating.,But by thinking differently,,and shipping these,,people can stay put.,They can make their own sterile drinking water,,and start to get on with rebuilding their homes and their lives. 
 Now, it doesn't require a natural disaster,for this to work.,Using the old thinking, of national infrastructure,and pipe work, is too expensive.,When you run the numbers on a calculator,,you run out of noughts.,So here is the "thinking different" bit. 
 Instead of shipping water,,and using man-made processes to do it,,let's use Mother Nature. She's got a fantastic system.,She picks the water up from there,,desalinates it, for free, transports it over there,,and dumps it onto the mountains, rivers, and streams.,And where do people live? Near water.,All we've go to do,is make it sterile. How do we do that? 
 Well, we could use the Lifesaver bottle.,Or we could use one of these.,The same technology, in a jerry can.,This will process 25,000 liters of water;,that's good enough for a family of four,,for three years.,And how much does it cost?,About half a cent a day to run.,Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 So, by thinking differently, and processing water,at the point of use,,mothers and children no longer have to walk four hours a day,to collect their water.,They can get it from a source nearby.,So with just eight billion dollars,,we can hit the millennium goal's target,of halving the number of people,without access to safe drinking water.,To put that into context,,The U.K. government spends about 12 billion pounds,a year on foreign aid.,But why stop there?,With 20 billion dollars, everyone can have access to safe drinking water.,So the three-and-a-half billion people,that suffer every year as a result,,and the two million kids that die every year,,will live.,Thank you. 
 (Applause)Take a look at this picture.,It poses a very fascinating puzzle for us.,These African students are doing their homework,under streetlights at the airport in the capital city,because they don't have any electricity at home.,Now, I haven't met these particular students,,but I've met students like them. 
 Let's just pick one -- for example, the one in the green shirt.,Let's give him a name, too: Nelson.,I'll bet Nelson has a cellphone.,So here is the puzzle.,Why is it that Nelson has access,to a cutting-edge technology, like the cellphone,,but doesn't have access to a 100-year-old technology,for generating electric light in the home? 
 Now, in a word, the answer is "rules.",Bad rules can prevent the kind of win-win solution that's available,when people can bring new technologies in,and make them available to someone like Nelson.,What kinds of rules?,The electric company in this nation,operates under a rule, which says that it has to sell,electricity at a very low, subsidized price --,in fact, a price that is so low it loses money on every unit that it sells.,So it has neither the resources, nor the incentives,,to hook up many other users. 
 The president wanted to change this rule.,He's seen that it's possible to have a different set of rules,,rules where businesses earn a small profit,,so they have an incentive to sign up more customers.,That's the kind of rules that the cellphone company,that Nelson purchases his telephony from operates under.,The president has seen how those rules worked well.,So he tried to change the rules for pricing on electricity,,but ran into a firestorm of protest,from businesses and consumers,who wanted to preserve the existing subsidized rates.,So he was stuck with rules that prevented him,from letting the win-win solution help his country.,And Nelson is stuck studying under the streetlights. 
 The real challenge then, is to try to figure out,how we can change rules.,Are there some rules we can develop for changing rules?,I want to argue that there is a general abstract insight,that we can make practical,,which is that, if we can give more choices to people,,and more choices to leaders --,who, in many countries, are also people.,(Laughter),But, it's useful to present the opposition between these two.,Because the kind of choice you might want to give to a leader,,a choice like giving the president the choice,to raise prices on electricity,,takes away a choice that people in the economy want.,They want the choice to be able to continue consuming,subsidized electric power.,So if you give just to one side or the other,,you'll have tension or friction.,But if we can find ways to give more choices to both,,that will give us a set of rules,for changing rules that get us out of traps. 
 Now, Nelson also has access to the Internet.,And he says that if you want to see,the damaging effects of rules,,the ways that rules can keep people in the dark,,look at the pictures from NASA of the earth at night.,In particular check out Asia.,If you zoom in here,,you can see North Korea, in outline here,,which is like a black hole compared to its neighbors.,Now, you won't be surprised to learn,that the rules in North Korea,keep people there in the dark. 
 But it is important to recognize,that North Korea and South Korea,started out with identical sets of rules,in both the sense of laws and regulations,,but also in the deeper senses of understandings,,norms, culture, values and beliefs.,When they separated, they made choices,that led to very divergent paths,for their sets of rules.,So we can change -- we as humans can change the rules,that we use to interact with each other,,for better, or for worse. 
 Now let's look at another region, the Caribbean.,Zoom in on Haiti,,in outline here.,Haiti is also dark,,compared to its neighbor here, the Dominican Republic,,which has about the same number of residents.,Both of these countries are dark compared to Puerto Rico,,which has half as many residents,as either Haiti or the Dominican Republic.,What Haiti warns us is that,rules can be bad because governments are weak.,It's not just that the rules are bad because,the government is too strong and oppressive, as in North Korea.,So that if we want to create environments with good rules,,we can't just tear down.,We've got to find ways to build up, as well. 
 Now, China dramatically demonstrates,both the potential and the challenges,of working with rules.,Back in the beginning of the data presented in this chart,,China was the world's high-technology leader.,Chinese had pioneered technologies like steel, printing, gunpowder.,But the Chinese never adopted, at least in that period,,effective rules for encouraging the spread of those ideas --,a profit motive that could have encouraged the spread.,And they soon adopted rules which,slowed down innovation,and cut China off from the rest of the world.,So as other countries in the world innovated,,in the sense both of developing,newer technologies,,but also developing newer rules,,the Chinese were cut off from those advances.,Income there stayed stagnant,,as it zoomed ahead in the rest of the world. 
 This next chart looks at more recent data.,It plots income, average income in China,as a percentage of average income in the United States.,In the '50s and '60s you can see that it was hovering at about three percent.,But then in the late '70s something changed.,Growth took off in China. The Chinese started catching up,very quickly with the United States. 
 If you go back to the map at night, you can get a clue,to the process that lead to the dramatic change in rules in China.,The brightest spot in China,,which you can see on the edge of the outline here,,is Hong Kong.,Hong Kong was a small bit of China,that, for most of the 20th century,,operated under a very different set of rules,than the rest of mainland China --,rules that were copied,from working market economies of the time,,and administered by the British. 
 In the 1950s, Hong Kong was a place where,millions of people could go, from the mainland,,to start in jobs like sewing shirts, making toys.,But, to get on a process of increasing income,,increasing skills,led to very rapid growth there.,Hong Kong was also the model,which leaders like Deng Xiaoping,could copy, when they decided to move,all of the mainland towards the market model. 
 But Deng Xiaoping instinctively understood,the importance of offering choices to his people.,So instead of forcing everyone in China,to shift immediately to the market model,,they proceeded by creating some special zones,that could do, in a sense, what Britain did:,make the opportunity to go work with the market rules,available to the people who wanted to opt in there.,So they created four special economic zones around Hong Kong:,zones where Chinese could come and work,,and cities grew up very rapidly there;,also zones where foreign firms could come in,and make things. 
 One of the zones next to Hong Kong has a city called Shenzhen.,In that city there is a Taiwanese firm,that made the iPhone that many of you have,,and they made it with labor from Chinese,who moved there to Shenzhen.,So after the four special zones,,there were 14 coastal cites,that were open in the same sense,,and eventually demonstrated successes,in these places that people could opt in to,,that they flocked to because of the advantages they offered.,Demonstrated successes there led to a consensus for,a move toward the market model for the entire economy. 
 Now the Chinese example shows us several points.,One is: preserve choices for people.,Two: operate on the right scale.,If you try to change the rules in a village, you could do that,,but a village would be too small,to get the kinds of benefits you can get if you have millions of people,all working under good rules.,On the other hand, the nation is too big.,If you try to change the rules in the nation,,you can't give some people a chance,to hold back, see how things turn out,,and let others zoom ahead and try the new rules.,But cities give you this opportunity,to create new places,,with new rules that people can opt in to.,And they're large enough,to get all of the benefits that we can have,when millions of us work together under good rules. 
 So the proposal is that we,conceive of something called a charter city.,We start with a charter that specifies,all the rules required,to attract the people who we'll need to build the city.,We'll need to attract the investors,who will build out the infrastructure --,the power system, the roads, the port, the airport, the buildings.,You'll need to attract firms,,who will come hire the people who move there first.,And you'll need to attract families,,the residents who will come and live there permanently,,raise their children, get an education for their children,,and get their first job. 
 With that charter, people will move there.,The city can be built.,And we can scale this model.,We can go do it over and over again.,To make it work, we need good rules. We've already discussed that.,Those are captured in the charter.,We also need the choices for people.,That's really built into the model,if we allow for the possibility of building cities,on uninhabited land.,You start from uninhabited territory.,People can come live under the new charter,,but no one is forced to live under it.,The final thing we need are choices for leaders. 
 And, to achieve the kind of choices we want for leaders,we need to allow for the potential for partnerships between nations:,cases where nations work together,,in effect, de facto,,the way China and Britain worked together,to build, first a little enclave of the market model,,and then scale it throughout China.,In a sense, Britain, inadvertently,,through its actions in Hong Kong,,did more to reduce world poverty,than all the aid programs that we've undertaken,in the last century.,So if we allow for these kind of partnerships,to replicate this again,,we can get those kinds of benefits scaled throughout the world. 
 In some cases this will involve a delegation of responsibility,,a delegation of control from one country to another,to take over certain kinds of administrative responsibilities.,Now, when I say that,,some of you are starting to think,,"Well, is this just bringing back colonialism?",It's not. But it's important to recognize that the kind of emotions,that come up when we start to think about these things,,can get in the way, can make us pull back,,can shut down our ability,,and our interest in trying to explore new ideas. 
 Why is this not like colonialism?,The thing that was bad about colonialism,,and the thing which is residually bad in some of our aid programs,,is that it involved elements of,coercion and condescension.,This model is all about choices,,both for leaders and for the people who will live in these new places.,And, choice is the antidote to coercion and condescension. 
 So let's talk about how this could play out in practice.,Let's take a particular leader, Raul Castro, who is the leader of Cuba.,It must have occurred to Castro,that he has the chance to do for Cuba,what Deng Xiaoping did for China,,but he doesn't have a Hong Kong there on the island in Cuba.,He does, though, have a little bit of light down in the south,that has a very special status.,There is a zone there, around Guantanamo Bay,,where a treaty gives the United States,administrative responsibility,for a piece of land that's about twice the size of Manhattan. 
 Castro goes to the prime minister of Canada,and says, "Look, the Yankees have a terrible PR problem.,They want to get out.,Why don't you, Canada, take over?,Build -- run a special administrative zone.,Allow a new city to be built up there.,Allow many people to come in.,Let us have a Hong Kong nearby.,Some of my citizens will move into that city as well.,Others will hold back. But this will be,the gateway that will connect,the modern economy and the modern world,to my country." 
 Now, where else might this model be tried?,Well, Africa. I've talked with leaders in Africa.,Many of them totally get the notion of a special zone,that people can opt into as a rule.,It's a rule for changing rules.,It's a way to create new rules, and let people opt-in,without coercion, and the opposition that coercion can force.,They also totally get the idea that in some instances,they can make more credible promises to long-term investors --,the kind of investors who will come build the port,,build the roads, in a new city -- 
 they can make more credible promises,if they do it along with a partner nation.,Perhaps even in some arrangement,that's a little bit like an escrow account,,where you put land in the escrow account,and the partner nation takes responsibility for it.,There is also lots of land in Africa,where new cities could be built.,This is a picture I took when I was flying along the coast.,There are immense stretches of land like this --,land where hundreds of millions of people could live.,Now, if we generalize this and think about,not just one or two charter cites, but dozens --,cities that will help create places for the,many hundreds of millions, perhaps billions of people,who will move to cities in the coming century -- 
 is there enough land for them?,Well, throughout the world, if we look at the lights at night,,the one thing that's misleading is that, visually, it looks,like most of the world is already built out.,So let me show you why that's wrong.,Take this representation of all of the land.,Turn it into a square that stands for,all the arable land on Earth.,And let these dots represent the land that's already taken up,by the cities that three billion people now live in.,If you move the dots down to the bottom of the rectangle,you can see that the cities for the existing three billion urban residents,take up only three percent of the arable land on earth. 
 So if we wanted to build cities for another billion people,,they would be dots like this.,We'd go from three percent of the arable land, to four percent.,We'd dramatically reduce the human footprint on Earth,by building more cities that people can move to.,And if these are cities governed by good rules,,they can be cities where people are safe from crime,,safe from disease and bad sanitation,,where people have a chance to get a job.,They can get basic utilities like electricity.,Their kids can get an education. 
 So what will it take to get started,building the first charter cities,,scaling this so we build many more?,It would help to have a manual.,(Laughter),What university professors could do,is write some details that might go into this manual.,You wouldn't want to let us run the cities,,go out and design them.,You wouldn't let academics out in the wild. (Laughter) 
 But, you could set us to work thinking about questions like,,suppose it isn't just Canada,that does the deal with Raul Castro.,Perhaps Brazil comes in as a participant,,and Spain as well. And perhaps Cuba wants to be,one of the partners in a four-way joint venture.,How would we write the treaty to do that?,There is less precedent for that, but that could easily be worked out. 
 How would we finance this?,Turns out Singapore and Hong Kong,are cities that made huge gains,on the value of the land that they owned when they got started.,You could use the gains on the value of the land,to pay for things like the police, the courts,,but the school system and the health care system too,,which make this a more attractive place to live,,makes this a place where people have higher incomes --,which, incidentally, makes the land more valuable.,So the incentives for the people helping to construct this zone,and build it, and set up the basic rules,,go very much in the right direction. 
 So there are many other details like this.,How could we have buildings that are,low cost and affordable for people who work,in a first job, assembling something like an iPhone,,but make those buildings energy efficient,,and make sure that they are safe, so they don't fall down,in an earthquake or a hurricane.,Many technical details to be worked out,,but those of us who are already starting to pursue these things,can already tell that there is no roadblock,,there's no impediment, other than a failure of imagination,,that will keep us from delivering on,a truly global win-win solution. 
 Let me conclude with this picture.,The reason we can be so well off,,even though there is so many people on earth,,is because of the power of ideas.,We can share ideas with other people,,and when they discover them, they share with us.,It's not like scarce objects,,where sharing means we each get less.,When we share ideas we all get more.,When we think about ideas in that way,,we usually think about technologies. 
 But there is another class of ideas:,the rules that govern how we interact with each other;,rules like, let's have a tax system,that supports a research university,that gives away certain kinds of knowledge for free.,Let's have a system where we have ownership of land,that is registered in a government office,,that people can pledge as collateral. 
 If we can keep innovating on our space of rules,,and particularly innovate in the sense,of coming up with rules for changing rules,,so we don't get stuck with bad rules,,then we can keep moving progress forward,and truly make the world a better place,,so that people like Nelson and his friends,don't have to study any longer under the streetlights. Thank you.,(Applause)Today I'm going to talk to you about the problem of other minds.,And the problem I'm going to talk about,is not the familiar one from philosophy,,which is, "How can we know,whether other people have minds?",That is, maybe you have a mind,,and everyone else is just a really convincing robot.,So that's a problem in philosophy,,but for today's purposes I'm going to assume,that many people in this audience have a mind,,and that I don't have to worry about this. 
 There is a second problem that is maybe even more familiar to us,as parents and teachers and spouses,and novelists,,which is, "Why is it so hard,to know what somebody else wants or believes?",Or perhaps, more relevantly,,"Why is it so hard to change what somebody else wants or believes?" 
 I think novelists put this best.,Like Philip Roth, who said,,"And yet, what are we to do about this terribly significant business,of other people?,So ill equipped are we all,,to envision one another's interior workings,and invisible aims.",So as a teacher and as a spouse,,this is, of course, a problem I confront every day.,But as a scientist, I'm interested in a different problem of other minds,,and that is the one I'm going to introduce to you today.,And that problem is, "How is it so easy,to know other minds?" 
 So to start with an illustration,,you need almost no information,,one snapshot of a stranger,,to guess what this woman is thinking,,or what this man is.,And put another way, the crux of the problem is,the machine that we use for thinking about other minds,,our brain, is made up of pieces, brain cells,,that we share with all other animals, with monkeys,and mice and even sea slugs.,And yet, you put them together in a particular network,,and what you get is the capacity to write Romeo and Juliet.,Or to say, as Alan Greenspan did,,"I know you think you understand what you thought I said,,but I'm not sure you realize that what you heard,is not what I meant.",(Laughter) 
 So, the job of my field of cognitive neuroscience,is to stand with these ideas,,one in each hand.,And to try to understand how you can put together,simple units, simple messages over space and time, in a network,,and get this amazing human capacity to think about minds.,So I'm going to tell you three things about this today.,Obviously the whole project here is huge.,And I'm going to tell you just our first few steps,about the discovery of a special brain region,for thinking about other people's thoughts.,Some observations on the slow development of this system,as we learn how to do this difficult job.,And then finally, to show that some of the differences,between people, in how we judge others,,can be explained by differences in this brain system. 
 So first, the first thing I want to tell you is that,there is a brain region in the human brain, in your brains,,whose job it is to think about other people's thoughts.,This is a picture of it.,It's called the Right Temporo-Parietal Junction.,It's above and behind your right ear.,And this is the brain region you used when you saw the pictures I showed you,,or when you read Romeo and Juliet,or when you tried to understand Alan Greenspan.,And you don't use it for solving any other kinds of logical problems.,So this brain region is called the Right TPJ.,And this picture shows the average activation,in a group of what we call typical human adults.,They're MIT undergraduates.,(Laughter) 
 The second thing I want to say about this brain system,is that although we human adults,are really good at understanding other minds,,we weren't always that way.,It takes children a long time to break into the system.,I'm going to show you a little bit of that long, extended process.,The first thing I'm going to show you is a change between age three and five,,as kids learn to understand,that somebody else can have beliefs that are different from their own.,So I'm going to show you a five-year-old,who is getting a standard kind of puzzle,that we call the false belief task. 
 Rebecca Saxe (Video): This is the first pirate. His name is Ivan.,And you know what pirates really like? 
 Child: What? RS: Pirates really like cheese sandwiches. 
 Child: Cheese? I love cheese! 
 RS: Yeah. So Ivan has this cheese sandwich,,and he says, "Yum yum yum yum yum!,I really love cheese sandwiches.",And Ivan puts his sandwich over here, on top of the pirate chest.,And Ivan says, "You know what? I need a drink with my lunch.",And so Ivan goes to get a drink.,And while Ivan is away,the wind comes,,and it blows the sandwich down onto the grass.,And now, here comes the other pirate.,This pirate is called Joshua.,And Joshua also really loves cheese sandwiches.,So Joshua has a cheese sandwich and he says,,"Yum yum yum yum yum! I love cheese sandwiches.",And he puts his cheese sandwich over here on top of the pirate chest. 
 Child: So, that one is his. 
 RS: That one is Joshua's. That's right. 
 Child: And then his went on the ground. 
 RS: That's exactly right. 
 Child: So he won't know which one is his. 
 RS: Oh. So now Joshua goes off to get a drink.,Ivan comes back and he says, "I want my cheese sandwich.",So which one do you think Ivan is going to take? 
 Child: I think he is going to take that one. 
 RS: Yeah, you think he's going to take that one? All right. Let's see.,Oh yeah, you were right. He took that one. 
 So that's a five-year-old who clearly understands,that other people can have false beliefs,and what the consequences are for their actions.,Now I'm going to show you a three-year-old,who got the same puzzle. 
 RS: And Ivan says, "I want my cheese sandwich.",Which sandwich is he going to take?,Do you think he's going to take that one? Let's see what happens.,Let's see what he does. Here comes Ivan.,And he says, "I want my cheese sandwich.",And he takes this one.,Uh-oh. Why did he take that one? 
 Child: His was on the grass. 
 So the three-year-old does two things differently.,First, he predicts Ivan will take the sandwich,that's really his.,And second, when he sees Ivan taking the sandwich where he left his,,where we would say he's taking that one because he thinks it's his,,the three-year-old comes up with another explanation:,He's not taking his own sandwich because he doesn't want it,,because now it's dirty, on the ground.,So that's why he's taking the other sandwich.,Now of course, development doesn't end at five.,And we can see the continuation of this process,of learning to think about other people's thoughts,by upping the ante,and asking children now, not for an action prediction,,but for a moral judgment.,So first I'm going to show you the three-year-old again. 
 RS.: So is Ivan being mean and naughty for taking Joshua's sandwich? 
 Child: Yeah. 
 RS: Should Ivan get in trouble for taking Joshua's sandwich? 
 Child: Yeah. 
 So it's maybe not surprising he thinks it was mean of Ivan,to take Joshua's sandwich,,since he thinks Ivan only took Joshua's sandwich,to avoid having to eat his own dirty sandwich.,But now I'm going to show you the five-year-old.,Remember the five-year-old completely understood,why Ivan took Joshua's sandwich. 
 RS: Was Ivan being mean and naughty,for taking Joshua's sandwich? 
 Child: Um, yeah. 
 And so, it is not until age seven,that we get what looks more like an adult response. 
 RS: Should Ivan get in trouble for taking Joshua's sandwich? 
 Child: No, because the wind should get in trouble. 
 He says the wind should get in trouble,for switching the sandwiches.,(Laughter) 
 And now what we've started to do in my lab,is to put children into the brain scanner,and ask what's going on in their brain,as they develop this ability to think about other people's thoughts.,So the first thing is that in children we see this same brain region, the Right TPJ,,being used while children are thinking about other people.,But it's not quite like the adult brain. 
 So whereas in the adults, as I told you,,this brain region is almost completely specialized --,it does almost nothing else except for thinking about other people's thoughts --,in children it's much less so,,when they are age five to eight,,the age range of the children I just showed you.,And actually if we even look at eight to 11-year-olds,,getting into early adolescence,,they still don't have quite an adult-like brain region.,And so, what we can see is that over the course of childhood,and even into adolescence,,both the cognitive system,,our mind's ability to think about other minds,,and the brain system that supports it,are continuing, slowly, to develop. 
 But of course, as you're probably aware,,even in adulthood,,people differ from one another in how good they are,at thinking of other minds, how often they do it,and how accurately.,And so what we wanted to know was, could differences among adults,in how they think about other people's thoughts,be explained in terms of differences in this brain region?,So, the first thing that we did is we gave adults a version,of the pirate problem that we gave to the kids.,And I'm going to give that to you now. 
 So Grace and her friend are on a tour of a chemical factory,,and they take a break for coffee.,And Grace's friend asks for some sugar in her coffee.,Grace goes to make the coffee,and finds by the coffee a pot,containing a white powder, which is sugar.,But the powder is labeled "Deadly Poison,",so Grace thinks that the powder is a deadly poison.,And she puts it in her friend's coffee.,And her friend drinks the coffee, and is fine. 
 How many people think it was morally permissible,for Grace to put the powder in the coffee?,Okay. Good. (Laughter),So we ask people, how much should Grace be blamed,in this case, which we call a failed attempt to harm? 
 And we can compare that to another case,,where everything in the real world is the same.,The powder is still sugar, but what's different is what Grace thinks.,Now she thinks the powder is sugar.,And perhaps unsurprisingly, if Grace thinks the powder is sugar,and puts it in her friend's coffee,,people say she deserves no blame at all.,Whereas if she thinks the powder was poison, even though it's really sugar,,now people say she deserves a lot of blame,,even though what happened in the real world was exactly the same. 
 And in fact, they say she deserves more blame,in this case, the failed attempt to harm,,than in another case,,which we call an accident.,Where Grace thought the powder was sugar,,because it was labeled "sugar" and by the coffee machine,,but actually the powder was poison.,So even though when the powder was poison,,the friend drank the coffee and died,,people say Grace deserves less blame in that case,,when she innocently thought it was sugar,,than in the other case, where she thought it was poison,and no harm occurred. 
 People, though, disagree a little bit,about exactly how much blame Grace should get,in the accident case.,Some people think she should deserve more blame,,and other people less.,And what I'm going to show you is what happened when we look inside,the brains of people while they're making that judgment.,So what I'm showing you, from left to right,,is how much activity there was in this brain region,,and from top to bottom, how much blame,people said that Grace deserved. 
 And what you can see is, on the left,when there was very little activity in this brain region,,people paid little attention to her innocent belief,and said she deserved a lot of blame for the accident.,Whereas on the right, where there was a lot of activity,,people paid a lot more attention to her innocent belief,,and said she deserved a lot less blame,for causing the accident. 
 So that's good, but of course,what we'd rather is have a way to interfere,with function in this brain region,,and see if we could change people's moral judgment.,And we do have such a tool.,It's called Trans-Cranial Magnetic Stimulation,,or TMS.,This is a tool that lets us pass a magnetic pulse,through somebody's skull, into a small region of their brain,,and temporarily disorganize the function of the neurons in that region. 
 So I'm going to show you a demo of this.,First, I'm going to show you that this is a magnetic pulse.,I'm going to show you what happens when you put a quarter on the machine.,When you hear clicks, we're turning the machine on.,So now I'm going to apply that same pulse to my brain,,to the part of my brain that controls my hand.,So there is no physical force, just a magnetic pulse. 
 Woman (Video): Ready, Rebecca? RS: Yes. 
 Okay, so it causes a small involuntary contraction in my hand,by putting a magnetic pulse in my brain.,And we can use that same pulse,,now applied to the RTPJ,,to ask if we can change people's moral judgments.,So these are the judgments I showed you before, people's normal moral judgments.,And then we can apply TMS to the RTPJ,and ask how people's judgments change.,And the first thing is, people can still do this task overall. 
 So their judgments of the case when everything was fine,remain the same. They say she deserves no blame.,But in the case of a failed attempt to harm,,where Grace thought that it was poison, although it was really sugar,,people now say it was more okay, she deserves less blame,for putting the powder in the coffee. 
 And in the case of the accident, where she thought that it was sugar,,but it was really poison and so she caused a death,,people say that it was less okay, she deserves more blame.,So what I've told you today is that,people come, actually, especially well equipped,to think about other people's thoughts. 
 We have a special brain system,that lets us think about what other people are thinking.,This system takes a long time to develop,,slowly throughout the course of childhood and into early adolescence.,And even in adulthood, differences in this brain region,can explain differences among adults,in how we think about and judge other people. 
 But I want to give the last word back to the novelists,,and to Philip Roth, who ended by saying,,"The fact remains that getting people right,is not what living is all about anyway.,It's getting them wrong that is living.,Getting them wrong and wrong and wrong,,and then on careful reconsideration,,getting them wrong again.",Thank you.,(Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: So, I have a question. When you start talking about using,magnetic pulses to change people's moral judgments,,that sounds alarming.,(Laughter),Please tell me that you're not taking phone calls from the Pentagon, say. 
 RS: I'm not.,I mean, they're calling, but I'm not taking the call.,(Laughter) 
 CA: They really are calling?,So then seriously,,you must lie awake at night sometimes,wondering where this work leads.,I mean, you're clearly an incredible human being,,but someone could take this knowledge,and in some future,not-torture chamber,,do acts that people here might be worried about. 
 RS: Yeah, we worry about this.,So, there's a couple of things to say about TMS.,One is that you can't be TMSed without knowing it.,So it's not a surreptitious technology.,It's quite hard, actually, to get those very small changes.,The changes I showed you are impressive to me,because of what they tell us about the function of the brain,,but they're small on the scale,of the moral judgments that we actually make. 
 And what we changed was not people's,moral judgments when they're deciding what to do,,when they're making action choices.,We changed their ability to judge other people's actions.,And so, I think of what I'm doing not so much as,studying the defendant in a criminal trial,,but studying the jury. 
 CA: Is your work going to lead to any recommendations,in education, to perhaps bring up,a generation of kids able to make fairer moral judgments? 
 RS: That's one of the idealistic hopes.,The whole research program here of studying,the distinctive parts of the human brain is brand new.,Until recently, what we knew about the brain,were the things that any other animal's brain could do too,,so we could study it in animal models.,We knew how brains see, and how they control the body,and how they hear and sense.,And the whole project of understanding,how brains do the uniquely human things --,learn language and abstract concepts,,and thinking about other people's thoughts -- that's brand new.,And we don't know yet what the implications will be,of understanding it. 
 CA: So I've got one last question. There is this thing called,the hard problem of consciousness,,that puzzles a lot of people.,The notion that you can understand,why a brain works, perhaps.,But why does anyone have to feel anything?,Why does it seem to require these beings who sense things,for us to operate?,You're a brilliant young neuroscientist.,I mean, what chances do you think there are,that at some time in your career,,someone, you or someone else,,is going to come up with some paradigm shift,in understanding what seems an impossible problem? 
 RS: I hope they do. And I think they probably won't. 
 CA: Why? 
 RS: It's not called the hard problem of consciousness for nothing.,(Laughter) 
 CA: That's a great answer. Rebecca Saxe, thank you very much. That was fantastic.,(Applause)I'm extremely excited to be given the opportunity,to come and speak to you today,about what I consider to be,the biggest stunt on Earth.,Or perhaps not quite on Earth.,A parachute jump from the very edge of space.,More about that a bit later on. 
 What I'd like to do first is take you through,a very brief helicopter ride of stunts,and the stunts industry in the movies and in television,,and show you how technology,has started to interface with the physical skills,of the stunt performer,in a way that makes the stunts bigger,and actually makes them safer than they've ever been before. 
 I've been a professional stunt man for 13 years.,I'm a stunt coordinator. And as well as perform stunts,I often design them.,During that time, health and safety has become everything about my job.,It's critical now that when a car crash happens,it isn't just the stunt person we make safe, it's the crew.,We can't be killing camera men. We can't be killing stunt men.,We can't be killing anybody or hurting anybody on set,,or any passerby. So, safety is everything.,But it wasn't always that way. 
 In the old days of the silent movies --,Harold Lloyd here, hanging famously from the clock hands --,a lot of these guys did their own stunts. They were quite remarkable.,They had no safety, no real technology.,What safety they had was very scant.,This is the first stunt woman,,Rosie Venger, an amazing woman.,You can see from the slide, very very strong.,She really paved the way,at a time when nobody was doing stunts, let alone women. 
 My favorite and a real hero of mine is Yakima Canutt.,Yakima Canutt really formed the stunt fight.,He worked with John Wayne and most of those old punch-ups you see,in the Westerns. Yakima was either there or he stunt coordinated.,This is a screen capture from "Stagecoach,",where Yakima Canutt is doing one of the most dangerous stunts I've ever seen.,There is no safety, no back support,,no pads, no crash mats, no sand pits in the ground.,That's one of the most dangerous horse stunts, certainly. 
 Talking of dangerous stunts and bringing things slightly up to date,,some of the most dangerous stunts we do as stunt people are fire stunts.,We couldn't do them without technology.,These are particularly dangerous,because there is no mask on my face.,They were done for a photo shoot. One for the Sun newspaper,,one for FHM magazine.,Highly dangerous, but also you'll notice,it doesn't look as though I'm wearing anything underneath the suit.,The fire suits of old, the bulky suits, the thick woolen suits,,have been replaced with modern materials,like Nomex or, more recently, Carbonex --,fantastic materials that enable us as stunt professionals,to burn for longer, look more spectacular, and in pure safety.,Here's a bit more.,There's a guy with a flame thrower there, giving me what for. 
 One of the things that a stuntman often does,,and you'll see it every time in the big movies,,is be blown through the air.,Well, we used to use trampettes. In the old days, that's all they had.,And that's a ramp. Spring off the thing and fly through the air,,and hopefully you make it look good. 
 Now we've got technology. This thing is called an air ram.,It's a frightening piece of equipment for the novice stunt performer,,because it will break your legs very, very quickly,if you land on it wrong.,Having said that, it works with compressed nitrogen.,And that's in the up position. When you step on it,,either by remote control or with the pressure of your foot,,it will fire you, depending on the gas pressure,,anything from five feet to 30 feet.,I could, quite literally, fire myself into the gallery.,Which I'm sure you wouldn't want.,Not today. 
 Car stunts are another area,where technology and engineering,advances have made life easier for us, and safer.,We can do bigger car stunts than ever before now.,Being run over is never easy.,That's an old-fashioned, hard, gritty, physical stunt.,But we have padding, and fantastic shock-absorbing things like Sorbothane --,the materials that help us, when we're hit like this,,not to hurt ourselves too much. 
 The picture in the bottom right-hand corner there,is of some crash test dummy work that I was doing.,Showing how stunts work in different areas, really.,And testing breakaway signpost pillars.,A company makes a Lattix pillar, which is a network,,a lattice-type pillar that collapses when it's hit.,The car on the left drove into the steel pillar.,And you can't see it from there, but the engine was in the driver's lap.,They did it by remote control.,I drove the other one at 60 miles an hour, exactly the same speed,,and clearly walked away from it. 
 Rolling a car over is another area where we use technology.,We used to have to drive up a ramp, and we still do sometimes.,But now we have a compressed nitrogen cannon.,You can just see, underneath the car, there is a black rod on the floor,by the wheel of the other car.,That's the piston that was fired out of the floor.,We can flip lorries, coaches, buses, anything over,with a nitrogen cannon with enough power. (Laughs) 
 It's a great job, really. (Laughter),It's such fun!,You should hear,some of the phone conversations that I have with people,on my Bluetooth in the shop.,"Well, we can flip the bus over, we can have it burst into flames,,and how about someone, you know, big explosion.",And people are looking like this ...,(Laughs),I sort of forget how bizarre some of those conversations are. 
 The next thing that I'd like to show you is something that,Dunlop asked me to do earlier this year,with our Channel Five's "Fifth Gear Show.",A loop-the-loop, biggest in the world.,Only one person had ever done it before.,Now, the stuntman solution to this in the old days would be,,"Let's hit this as fast as possible. 60 miles an hour.,Let's just go for it. Foot flat to the floor.",Well, you'd die if you did that. 
 We went to Cambridge University, the other university,,and spoke to a Doctor of Mechanical Engineering there,,a physicist who taught us that it had to be 37 miles an hour.,Even then, I caught seven G,and lost a bit of consciousness on the way in.,That's a long way to fall, if you get it wrong. That was just about right.,So again, science helps us, and with the engineering too --,the modifications to the car and the wheel. 
 High falls, they're old fashioned stunts.,What's interesting about high falls,is that although we use airbags,,and some airbags are quite advanced,,they're designed so you don't slip off the side like you used to,,if you land a bit wrong. So, they're a much safer proposition.,Just basically though, it is a basic piece of equipment.,It's a bouncy castle,with slats in the side to allow the air to escape.,That's all it is, a bouncy castle.,That's the only reason we do it. See, it's all fun, this job.,What's interesting is we still use cardboard boxes.,They used to use cardboard boxes years ago and we still use them.,And that's interesting because they are almost retrospective.,They're great for catching you, up to certain heights. 
 And on the other side of the fence,,that physical art, the physical performance of the stuntman,,has interfaced with the very highest,technology in I.T. and in software.,Not the cardboard box, but the green screen.,This is a shot of "Terminator," the movie.,Two stunt guys doing what I consider to be a rather benign stunt.,It's 30 feet. It's water. It's very simple.,With the green screen we can put any background in the world on it,,moving or still,,and I can assure you, nowadays you can't see the joint.,This is a parachutist with another parachutist doing exactly the same thing.,Completely in the safety of a studio,,and yet with the green screen we can have some moving image that a skydiver took,,and put in the sky moving and the clouds whizzing by. 
 Decelerator rigs and wires, we use them a lot.,We fly people on wires, like this.,This guy is not skydiving. He's being flown like a kite,,or moved around like a kite. 
 And this is a Guinness World Record attempt.,They asked me to open their 50th anniversary show in 2004.,And again, technology meant that I could do the fastest abseil over 100 meters,,and stop within a couple of feet of the ground,without melting the rope with the friction,,because of the alloys I used in the descender device.,And that's Centre Point in London.,We brought Oxford Street and Tottenham Court Road to a standstill. 
 Helicopter stunts are always fun,,hanging out of them, whatever.,And aerial stunts. No aerial stunt would be the same without skydiving.,Which brings us quite nicely to why I'm really here today:,Project Space Jump. 
 In 1960, Joseph Kittenger of the United States Air Force,did the most spectacular thing.,He did a jump from 100,000 feet, 102,000 to be precise,,and he did it to test high altitude systems,for military pilots,in the new range of aircraft that were going up to 80,000 feet or so.,And I'd just like to show you a little footage,of what he did back then.,And just how brave he was in 1960, bear in mind. 
 Project Excelsior, it was called.,There were three jumps.,They first dropped some dummies.,So that's the balloon, big gas balloon.,It's that shape because the helium has to expand.,My balloon will expand to 500 times,and look like a big pumpkin when it's at the top.,These are the dummies being dropped from 100,000 feet,,and there is the camera that's strapped to them.,You can clearly see the curvature of the Earth at that kind of altitude.,And I'm planning to go from 120,000 feet,,which is about 22 miles.,You're in a near vacuum in that environment,,which is in minus 50 degrees.,So it's an extremely hostile place to be. 
 This is Joe Kittenger himself.,Bear in mind, ladies and gents, this was 1960.,He didn't know if he would live or die. This is an extremely brave man.,I spoke with him on the phone a few months ago.,He's a very humble and wonderful human being.,He sent me an email, saying, "If you get this thing off the ground,I wish you all the best." And he signed it, "Happy landings,",which I thought was quite lovely.,He's in his 80s and he lives in Florida. He's a tremendous guy.,This is him in a pressure suit. 
 Now one of the challenges of going up to altitude is,when you get to 30,000 feet -- it's great, isn't it? --,When you get to 30,000 feet you can really only use oxygen.,Above 30,000 feet up to nearly 50,000 feet,,you need pressure breathing, which is where you're wearing a G suit.,This is him in his old rock-and-roll jeans there,,pushing him in, those turned up jeans.,You need a pressure suit.,You need a pressure breathing system,with a G suit that squeezes you, that helps you to breathe in,and helps you to exhale. 
 Above 50,000 feet you need a space suit, a pressure suit.,Certainly at 100,000 feet no aircraft will fly.,Not even a jet engine.,It needs to be rocket-powered or one of these things,,a great big gas balloon.,It took me a while; it took me years to find the right balloon team,to build the balloon that would do this job.,I've found that team in America now.,And it's made of polyethylene, so it's very thin.,We will have two balloons for each of my test jumps,,and two balloons for the main jump, because they,notoriously tear on takeoff.,They're just so, so delicate. 
 This is the step off. He's written on that thing,,"The highest step in the world.",And what must that feel like?,I'm excited and I'm scared,,both at the same time in equal measures.,And this is the camera that he had on him as he tumbled,before his drogue chute opened to stabilize him.,A drogue chute is just a smaller chute which helps to keep your face down.,You can just see them there, popping open.,Those are the drogue chutes. He had three of them.,I did quite a lot of research.,And you'll see in a second there, he comes back down to the floor. 
 Now just to give you some perspective of this balloon,,the little black dots are people.,It's hundreds of feet high. It's enormous.,That's in New Mexico.,That's the U.S. Air Force Museum.,And they've made a dummy of him. That's exactly what it looked like.,My gondola will be more simple than that.,It's a three sided box, basically. 
 So I've had to do quite a lot of training.,This is Morocco last year in the Atlas mountains,,training in preparation for some high altitude jumps.,This is what the view is going to be like,at 90,000 feet for me.,Now you may think this is just,a thrill-seeking trip, a pleasure ride,,just the world's biggest stunt.,Well there's a little bit more to it than that. 
 Trying to find a space suit to do this,has led me to an area of technology,that I never really expected when I set about doing this.,I contacted a company in the States,who make suits for NASA.,That's a current suit. This was me last year with their chief engineer.,That suit would cost me about a million and a half dollars.,And it weighs 300 pounds and you can't skydive in it.,So I've been stuck. For the past 15 years I've been trying to find a space suit,that would do this job, or someone that will make one. 
 Something revolutionary happened,a little while ago, at the same facility.,That's the prototype of the parachute. I've now had them custom make one,,the only one of its kind in the world. And that's the only suit of its kind in the world.,It was made by a Russian that's designed,most of the suits of the past,18 years for the Soviets.,He left the company because he saw,,as some other people in the space suit industry,,an emerging market for space suits for space tourists. 
 You know if you are in an aircraft at 30,000 feet,and the cabin depressurizes, you can have oxygen.,If you're at 100,000 feet you die.,In six seconds you've lost consciousness. In 10 seconds you're dead.,Your blood tries to boil. It's called vaporization.,The body swells up. It's awful.,And so we expect -- it's not much fun.,We expect, and others expect,,that perhaps the FAA, the CAA,might say, "You need to put someone in a suit,that's not inflated, that's connected to the aircraft.",Then they're comfortable, they have good vision, like this great big visor.,And then if the cabin depressurizes,while the aircraft is coming back down,,in whatever emergency measures, everyone is okay. 
 I would like to bring Costa on, if he's here,,to show you the only one of its kind in the world.,I was going to wear it,,but I thought I'd get Costa to do it, my lovely assistant.,Thank you. He's very hot. Thank you, Costa.,This is the communication headset you'll see,on lots of space suits.,It's a two-layer suit. NASA suits have got 13 layers.,This is a very lightweight suit. It weighs about 15 pounds.,It's next to nothing. Especially designed for me. 
 It's a working prototype. I will use it for all the jumps.,Would you just give us a little twirl, please, Costa?,Thank you very much.,And it doesn't look far different when it's inflated,,as you can see from the picture down there. 
 I've even skydived in it in a wind tunnel,,which means that I can practice everything I need to practice, in safety,,before I ever jump out of anything. Thanks very much, Costa.,(Applause) 
 Ladies and gentlemen, that's just about it from me.,The status of my mission at the moment,is it still needs a major sponsor.,I'm confident that we'll find one.,I think it's a great challenge.,And I hope that you will agree with me,,it is the greatest stunt on Earth.,Thank you very much for your time.,(Applause)The key question is, "When are we going to get fusion?",It's really been a long time since we've known about fusion.,We've known about fusion since 1920,,when Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington,and the British Association for the Advancement of Science,conjectured that that's why the sun shines. 
 I've always been very worried about resource.,I don't know about you, but,when my mother gave me food,,I always sorted the ones I disliked,from the ones I liked.,And I ate the disliked ones first,,because the ones you like, you want to save.,And as a child you're always worried about resource.,And once it was sort of explained to me,how fast we were using up the world's resources,,I got very upset,,about as upset as I did when I realized,that the Earth will only last about five billion years,before it's swallowed by the sun.,Big events in my life,,a strange child.,(Laughter) 
 Energy, at the moment, is dominated by resource.,The countries that make a lot of money out of energy,have something underneath them.,Coal-powered industrial revolution in this country --,oil, gas, sorry.,(Laughter),Gas, I'm probably the only person,who really enjoys it when Mister Putin,turns off the gas tap, because my budget goes up. 
 We're really dominated now,by those things that we're using up faster and faster and faster.,And as we try to lift billions of people out of poverty,in the Third World, in the developing world,,we're using energy faster and faster.,And those resources are going away.,And the way we'll make energy in the future,is not from resource,,it's really from knowledge.,If you look 50 years into the future,,the way we probably will be making energy,is probably one of these three,,with some wind, with some other things,,but these are going to be the base load energy drivers. 
 Solar can do it, and we certainly have to develop solar.,But we have a lot of knowledge to gain before we can make solar,the base load energy supply for the world.,Fission.,Our government is going to put in six new nuclear power stations.,They're going to put in six new nuclear power stations,,and probably more after that.,China is building nuclear power stations. Everybody is.,Because they know that that is one sure way,to do carbon-free energy. 
 But if you wanted to know what the perfect energy source is,,the perfect energy source is one,that doesn't take up much space,,has a virtually inexhaustible supply,,is safe, doesn't put any carbon into the atmosphere,,doesn't leave any long-lived radioactive waste:,it's fusion.,But there is a catch. Of course there is always a catch in these cases.,Fusion is very hard to do.,We've been trying for 50 years. 
 Okay. What is fusion? Here comes the nuclear physics.,And sorry about that, but this is what turns me on.,(Laughter),I was a strange child.,Nuclear energy comes for a simple reason.,The most stable nucleus is iron, right in the middle of the periodic table.,It's a medium-sized nucleus.,And you want to go towards iron if you want to get energy.,So, uranium, which is very big, wants to split.,But small atoms want to join together,,small nuclei want to join together,to make bigger ones to go towards iron. 
 And you can get energy out this way.,And indeed that's exactly what stars do.,In the middle of stars, you're joining hydrogen together to make helium,and then helium together to make carbon,,to make oxygen, all the things that you're made of,are made in the middle of stars.,But it's a hard process to do,because, as you know, the middle of a star is quite hot,,almost by definition.,And there is one reaction,that's probably the easiest fusion reaction to do.,It's between two isotopes of hydrogen, two kinds of hydrogen:,deuterium, which is heavy hydrogen,,which you can get from seawater,,and tritium which is super-heavy hydrogen. 
 These two nuclei, when they're far apart, are charged.,And you push them together and they repel.,But when you get them close enough,,something called the strong force starts to act,and pulls them together.,So, most of the time they repel.,You get them closer and closer and closer and then at some point,the strong force grips them together.,For a moment they become helium 5,,because they've got five particles inside them. 
 So, that's that process there. Deuterium and tritium goes together,makes helium 5.,Helium splits out, and a neutron comes out,and lots of energy comes out.,If you can get something to about 150 million degrees,,things will be rattling around so fast,that every time they collide in just the right configuration,,this will happen, and it will release energy.,And that energy is what powers fusion.,And it's this reaction that we want to do. 
 There is one trickiness about this reaction.,Well, there is a trickiness that you have to make it 150 million degrees,,but there is a trickiness about the reaction yet.,It's pretty hot.,The trickiness about the reaction is that,tritium doesn't exist in nature.,You have to make it from something else.,And you make if from lithium. That reaction at the bottom,,that's lithium 6, plus a neutron,,will give you more helium, plus tritium.,And that's the way you make your tritium.,But fortunately, if you can do this fusion reaction,,you've got a neutron, so you can make that happen. 
 Now, why the hell would we bother to do this?,This is basically why we would bother to do it.,If you just plot how much fuel,we've got left, in units of,present world consumption.,And as you go across there you see,a few tens of years of oil -- the blue line, by the way,,is the lowest estimate of existing resources.,And the yellow line is the most optimistic estimate. 
 And as you go across there you will see,that we've got a few tens of years, and perhaps 100 years,of fossil fuels left.,And god knows we don't really want to burn all of it,,because it will make an awful lot of carbon in the air.,And then we get to uranium.,And with current reactor technology,we really don't have very much uranium.,And we will have to extract uranium from sea water,,which is the yellow line,,to make conventional nuclear power stations,actually do very much for us.,This is a bit shocking, because in fact our government,is relying on that for us to meet Kyoto,,and do all those kind of things. 
 To go any further you would have to have breeder technology.,And breeder technology is fast breeders. And that's pretty dangerous.,The big thing, on the right,,is the lithium we have in the world.,And lithium is in sea water. That's the yellow line.,And we have 30 million years worth of fusion fuel in sea water.,Everybody can get it. That's why we want to do fusion.,Is it cost-competitive?,We make estimates of what we think it would cost,to actually make a fusion power plant.,And we get within about the same price,as current electricity. 
 So, how would we make it?,We have to hold something at 150 million degrees.,And, in fact, we've done this.,We hold it with a magnetic field.,And inside it, right in the middle of this toroidal shape, doughnut shape,,right in the middle is 150 million degrees.,It boils away in the middle at 150 million degrees.,And in fact we can make fusion happen.,And just down the road, this is JET.,It's the only machine in the world that's actually done fusion. 
 When people say fusion is 30 years away, and always will be,,I say, "Yeah, but we've actually done it." Right?,We can do fusion. In the center of this device,we made 16 megawatts of fusion power in 1997.,And in 2013 we're going to fire it up again,and break all those records.,But that's not really fusion power. That's just making some fusion happen.,We've got to take that, we've got to make that into a fusion reactor.,Because we want 30 million years worth of fusion power for the Earth.,This is the device we're building now. 
 It gets very expensive to do this research.,It turns out you can't do fusion on a table top,despite all that cold fusion nonsense. Right?,You can't. You have to do it in a very big device.,More than half the world's population is involved in building this device,in southern France, which is a nice place to put an experiment.,Seven nations are involved in building this.,It's going to cost us 10 billion. And we'll produce half a gigawatt of fusion power.,But that's not electricity yet.,We have to get to this.,We have to get to a power plant.,We have to start putting electricity on the grid,in this very complex technology.,And I'd really like it to happen a lot faster than it is.,But at the moment, all we can imagine is sometime in the 2030s. 
 I wish this were different. We really need it now.,We're going to have a problem with power,in the next five years in this country.,So 2030 looks like an infinity away.,But we can't abandon it now; we have to push forward,,get fusion to happen.,I wish we had more money, I wish we had more resources.,But this is what we're aiming at,,sometime in the 2030s --,real electric power from fusion. Thank you very much.,(Applause)I'd like to talk a little bit this morning,about what happens if we move from design,to design thinking.,Now this rather old photo up there,is actually the first project I was ever hired to do,,something like 25 years ago.,It's a woodworking machine, or at least a piece of one,,and my task was to,make this thing a little bit more modern,,a little bit easier to use.,I thought, at the time, I did a pretty good job.,Unfortunately, not very long afterwards,the company went out of business. 
 This is the second project that I did. It's a fax machine.,I put an attractive shell around some new technology.,Again, 18 months later,,the product was obsolete.,And now, of course, the whole technology is obsolete.,Now, I'm a fairly slow learner,,but eventually it occurred to me that,maybe what passed for design,wasn't all that important --,making things more attractive,,making them a bit easier to use,,making them more marketable.,By focusing on a design,,maybe just a single product,,I was being incremental,and not having much of an impact. 
 But I think this small view of design,is a relatively recent phenomenon,,and in fact really emerged,in the latter half of the 20th century,as design became a tool of consumerism.,So when we talk about design today,,and particularly when we read about it in the popular press,,we're often talking about products like these.,Amusing? Yes. Desirable? Maybe.,Important? Not so very. 
 But this wasn't always the way.,And I'd like to suggest that if we take,a different view of design,,and focus less on the object,and more on design thinking as an approach,,that we actually might see the result in a bigger impact.,Now this gentleman, Isambard Kingdom Brunel,,designed many great things in his career in the 19th century,,including the Clifton suspension bridge in Bristol,and the Thames tunnel at Rotherhithe.,Both great designs and actually very innovative too.,His greatest creation,runs actually right through here in Oxford.,It's called the Great Western Railway. 
 And as a kid I grew up very close to here,,and one of my favorite things to do,was to cycle along by the side of the railway,waiting for the great big express trains to roar past.,You can see it represented here in J.M.W. Turner's painting,,"Rain, Steam and Speed".,Now, what Brunel said that he wanted to achieve for his passengers,was the experience of floating across the countryside. 
 Now, this was back in the 19th century.,And to do that meant creating the flattest gradients,that had ever yet been made,,which meant building long viaducts across river valleys --,this is actually the viaduct across the Thames at Maidenhead --,and long tunnels such as the one at Box, in Wiltshire.,But he didn't stop there. He didn't stop,with just trying to design the best railway journey.,He imagined an integrated transportation system,in which it would be possible for a passenger to embark,on a train in London,and disembark from a ship in New York.,One journey from London to New York.,This is the S.S. Great Western that he built,to take care of the second half of that journey. 
 Now, Brunel was working 100 years before,the emergence of the design profession,,but I think he was using design thinking,to solve problems and to create world-changing innovations.,Now, design thinking begins with what Roger Martin,,the business school professor at the University of Toronto,,calls integrative thinking.,And that's the ability to exploit opposing ideas,and opposing constraints,to create new solutions.,In the case of design, that means,balancing desirability, what humans need,,with technical feasibility,,and economic viability.,With innovations like the Great Western,,we can stretch that balance to the absolute limit. 
 So somehow, we went from this to this.,Systems thinkers who were reinventing the world,,to a priesthood of folks in black turtlenecks and designer glasses,working on small things.,As our industrial society matured,,so design became a profession,and it focused on an ever smaller canvas,until it came to stand for aesthetics,,image and fashion.,Now I'm not trying to throw stones here.,I'm a fully paid-up member of that priesthood,,and somewhere in here I have my designer glasses.,There we go.,But I do think that perhaps design,is getting big again.,And that's happening through,the application of design thinking,to new kinds of problems --,to global warming, to education,,healthcare, security, clean water, whatever. 
 And as we see this reemergence of design thinking,and we see it beginning to tackle new kinds of problems,,there are some basic ideas that I think we can observe that are useful.,And I'd like to talk about some of those,just for the next few minutes.,The first of those is that design is,human-centered.,It may integrate technology and economics,,but it starts with what humans need, or might need.,What makes life easier, more enjoyable?,What makes technology useful and usable?,But that is more than simply good ergonomics,,putting the buttons in the right place.,It's often about understanding culture and context,before we even know where to start to have ideas. 
 So when a team was working on a new vision screening program in India,,they wanted to understand what the aspirations,and motivations were of these school children,to understand how they might play a role,in screening their parents.,Conversion Sound has developed a high quality,,ultra-low-cost digital hearing aid,for the developing world.,Now, in the West we rely on highly trained technicians,to fit these hearing aids.,In places like India, those technicians simply don't exist.,So it took a team working in India,with patients and community health workers,to understand how a PDA,and an application on a PDA,might replace those technicians,in a fitting and diagnostic service. 
 Instead of starting with technology,,the team started with people and culture.,So if human need is the place to start,,then design thinking rapidly moves on to,learning by making.,Instead of thinking about what to build,,building in order to think.,Now, prototypes speed up the process of innovation,,because it is only when we put our ideas out into the world,that we really start to understand their strengths and weaknesses.,And the faster we do that,,the faster our ideas evolve. 
 Now, much has been said and written about,the Aravind Eye Institute in Madurai, India.,They do an incredible job of serving very poor patients,by taking the revenues from those who can afford to pay,to cross-subsidize those who cannot.,Now, they are very efficient,,but they are also very innovative.,When I visited them a few years ago,,what really impressed me was their willingness,to prototype their ideas very early. 
 This is the manufacturing facility,for one of their biggest cost breakthroughs.,They make their own intraocular lenses.,These are the lenses that replace those,that are damaged by cataracts.,And I think it's partly their prototyping mentality,that really allowed them to achieve the breakthrough.,Because they brought the cost down,from $200 a pair,,down to just $4 a pair.,Partly they did this by instead of building,a fancy new factory,,they used the basement of one of their hospitals.,And instead of installing the large-scale machines,used by western producers,,they used low-cost CAD/CAM prototyping technology.,They are now the biggest manufacturer of these lenses in the developing world,and have recently moved into a custom factory. 
 So if human need is the place to start,,and prototyping, a vehicle for progress,,then there are also some questions to ask about the destination.,Instead of seeing its primary objective as consumption,,design thinking is beginning to explore the potential of participation --,the shift from a passive relationship,between consumer and producer,to the active engagement of everyone,in experiences that are meaningful,,productive and profitable. 
 So I'd like to take the idea that Rory Sutherland talked about,,this notion that intangible things are worth perhaps more than physical things,,and take that a little bit further and say that,I think the design of participatory systems,,in which many more forms of value,beyond simply cash,are both created and measured,,is going to be the major theme, not only for design,,but also for our economy as we go forward. 
 So William Beveridge, when he wrote the first of his famous reports in 1942,,created what became Britain's welfare state,in which he hoped that every citizen,would be an active participant,in their own social well-being.,By the time he wrote his third report,,he confessed that he had failed,and instead had created a society of welfare consumers. 
 Hilary Cottam, Charlie Leadbeater,,and Hugo Manassei of Participle,have taken this idea of participation,,and in their manifesto entitled Beveridge 4.0,,they are suggesting a framework,for reinventing the welfare state.,So in one of their projects called Southwark Circle,,they worked with residents in Southwark, South London,and a small team of designers,to develop a new membership organization,to help the elderly with household tasks.,Designs were refined and developed,with 150 older people and their families,before the service was launched earlier this year. 
 We can take this idea of participation,perhaps to its logical conclusion,and say that design may have its greatest impact,when it's taken out of the hands of designers,and put into the hands of everyone.,Nurses and practitioners at U.S. healthcare system,Kaiser Permanente,study the topic of improving the patient experience,,and particularly focused on the way that they exchange knowledge,and change shift.,Through a program of observational research,,brainstorming new solutions and rapid prototyping,,they've developed a completely new way to change shift. 
 They went from retreating to the nurse's station,to discuss the various states and needs of patients,,to developing a system that happened on the ward,in front of patients, using a simple software tool.,By doing this they brought the time that they were away from patients,down from 40 minutes to 12 minutes, on average.,They increased patient confidence and nurse happiness.,When you multiply that by all the nurses,in all the wards in 40 hospitals in the system,,it resulted, actually, in a pretty big impact. 
 And this is just one of thousands,of opportunities in healthcare alone.,So these are just some of the kind of basic ideas,around design thinking,and some of the new kinds of projects,that they're being applied to.,But I'd like to go back to Brunel here,,and suggest a connection that might explain why this is happening now,,and maybe why design thinking is a useful tool.,And that connection is change.,In times of change we need,new alternatives, new ideas. 
 Now, Brunel worked at the height of the Industrial Revolution,,when all of life and our economy,was being reinvented.,Now the industrial systems of Brunel's time have run their course,,and indeed they are part of the problem today.,But, again, we are in the midst of massive change.,And that change is forcing us to question,quite fundamental aspects of our society --,how we keep ourselves healthy, how we govern ourselves,,how we educate ourselves, how we keep ourselves secure.,And in these times of change, we need these new choices,because our existing solutions are simply becoming obsolete. 
 So why design thinking?,Because it gives us a new way of tackling problems.,Instead of defaulting to our normal convergent approach,where we make the best choice out of available alternatives,,it encourages us to take a divergent approach,,to explore new alternatives, new solutions,,new ideas that have not existed before.,But before we go through that process of divergence,,there is actually quite an important first step.,And that is, what is the question that we're trying to answer?,What's the design brief?,Now Brunel may have asked a question like this,,"How do I take a train from London to New York?",But what are the kinds of questions that we might ask today? 
 So these are some that we've been asked to think about recently.,And one in particular, is one that we're working on with the Acumen Fund,,in a project that's been funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.,How might we improve access to safe drinking water,for the world's poorest people,,and at the same time stimulate innovation,amongst local water providers? 
 So instead of having a bunch of American designers,come up with new ideas that may or may not have been appropriate,,we took a sort of more open, collaborative and participative approach.,We teamed designers and investment experts up with,11 water organizations across India.,And through workshops they developed,innovative new products, services, and business models. 
 We hosted a competition,and then funded five of those organizations,to develop their ideas.,So they developed and iterated these ideas.,And then IDEO and Acumen spent several weeks working with them,to help design new social marketing campaigns,,community outreach strategies, business models,,new water vessels for storing water,and carts for delivering water.,Some of those ideas are just getting launched into the market.,And the same process is just getting underway,with NGOs in East Africa. 
 So for me, this project shows,kind of how far we can go from,some of those sort of small things,that I was working on,at the beginning of my career.,That by focusing on the needs of humans,and by using prototypes,to move ideas along quickly,,by getting the process out of the hands of designers,,and by getting the active participation of the community,,we can tackle bigger and more interesting questions.,And just like Brunel, by focusing on systems,,we can have a bigger impact.,So that's one thing that we've been working on. 
 I'm actually really quite interested, and perhaps more interested,to know what this community thinks we could work on.,What kinds of questions do we think,design thinking could be used to tackle?,And if you've got any ideas,then feel free, you can post them to Twitter.,There is a hash tag there that you can use, #CBDQ.,And the list looked something like this a little while ago.,And of course you can search to find the questions that you're interested in,by using the same hash code. 
 So I'd like to believe that design thinking,actually can make a difference,,that it can help create new ideas,and new innovations,,beyond the latest High Street products.,To do that I think we have to take a more expansive view of design,,more like Brunel, less a domain of a professional priesthood.,And the first step is to start asking the right questions.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)I want to start with a game. Okay?,And to win this game,,all you have to do is seenthe reality that's in front of you,as it really is, all right?,So we have two panels here,nof colored dots.,And one of those dotsnis the same in the two panels.,And you have to tell me which one. 
 Now, I narrowed it down,to the gray one, the green one,nand, say, the orange one.,So by a show of hands,nwe'll start with the easiest one.,Show of hands: how many peoplenthink it's the gray one?,Really? Okay.,How many people think it's the green one?,And how many peoplenthink it's the orange one?,Pretty even split. 
 Let's find out what the reality is.,Here is the orange one. 
 (Laughter) 
 Here is the green one.,And here is the gray one. 
 (Laughter) 
 So for all of you who saw that,nyou're complete realists.,All right? 
 (Laughter) 
 So this is pretty amazing, isn't it?,Because nearly every living system,has evolved the abilitynto detect light in one way or another.,So for us, seeing color,is one of the simplest thingsnthe brain does.,And yet, even at thisnmost fundamental level,,context is everything.,What I'm going to talk aboutnis not that context is everything,,but why context is everything.,Because it's answering that question,that tells us not onlynwhy we see what we do,,but who we are as individuals,,and who we are as a society. 
 But first, we have to asknanother question,,which is, "What is color for?",And instead of telling you,nI'll just show you.,What you see here is a jungle scene,,and you see the surfacesnaccording to the amount of light,that those surfaces reflect.,Now, can any of you see the predatornthat's about to jump out at you?,And if you haven't seen it yet,nyou're dead, right? 
 (Laughter) 
 Can anyone see it? Anyone? No?,Now let's see the surfaces,according to the quality of lightnthat they reflect.,And now you see it. 
 So, color enables us to see,the similarities and differencesnbetween surfaces,,according to the full spectrumnof light that they reflect.,But what you've just done,is in many respectsnmathematically impossible.,Why?,Because, as Berkeley tells us,,we have no direct accessnto our physical world,,other than through our senses.,And the light that falls onto our eyes,is determined by multiplenthings in the world,,not only the color of objects,,but also the color of their illumination,,and the color of the spacenbetween us and those objects.,You vary any one of those parameters,,and you'll change the colornof the light that falls onto your eye. 
 This is a huge problem,,because it means that the same image,could have an infinite numbernof possible real-world sources.,Let me show you what I mean.,Imagine that thisnis the back of your eye, okay?,And these are two projectionsnfrom the world.,They're identical in every single way.,Identical in shape,nsize, spectral content.,They are the same,nas far as your eye is concerned.,And yet they comenfrom completely different sources.,The one on the rightncomes from a yellow surface,,in shadow, oriented facing the left,,viewed through a pinkish medium.,The one on the left comesnfrom an orange surface,,under direct light, facing to the right,,viewed through sort of a bluish medium.,Completely different meanings,,giving rise to the exact samenretinal information.,And yet it's only the retinalninformation that we get. 
 So how on Earth do we even see?,So if you remember anythingnin this next 18 minutes,,remember this:,that the light that falls onto your eye,,sensory information, is meaningless,,because it could mean literally anything.,And what's true for sensory informationnis true for information generally.,There's no inherentnmeaning in information.,It's what we do with thatninformation that matters. 
 So, how do we see?nWell, we see by learning to see.,The brain evolved the mechanismsnfor finding patterns,,finding relationships in information,,and associating those relationshipsnwith a behavioral meaning,,a significance, by interactingnwith the world.,We're very aware of this,in the form of more cognitivenattributes, like language.,I'm going to give you some letter strings,,and I want you to read themnout for me, if you can. 
 Audience: "Can you read this?","You are not reading this.","What are you reading?" 
 Beau Lotto: "What are you reading?"nHalf the letters are missing, right?,There's no a priori reason,why an "H" has to gonbetween that "W" and "A.",But you put one there. Why?,Because in the statisticsnof your past experience,,it would have been useful to do so.,So you do so again.,And yet you don't put a letternafter that first "T.",Why? Because it wouldn't have beennuseful in the past.,So you don't do it again. 
 So, let me show you how quicklynour brains can redefine normality,,even at the simplest thingnthe brain does, which is color.,So if I could haventhe lights down up here.,I want you to first notice that thosentwo desert scenes are physically the same.,One is simply the flipping of the other.,Now I want you to look at that dot,between the green and the red.,And I want you to stare at that dot.nDon't look anywhere else.,We're going to looknat it for about 30 seconds,,which is a bit of a killernin an 18-minute talk. 
 (Laughter) 
 But I really want you to learn.,And I'll tell you -- don't looknanywhere else --,I'll tell you what'snhappening in your head.,Your brain is learning,,and it's learningnthat the right side of its visual field,is under red illumination;,the left side of its visual fieldnis under green illumination.,That's what it's learning. Okay?,Now, when I tell you, I want you to looknat the dot between the two desert scenes.,So why don't you do that now? 
 (Laughter) 
 Can I have the lights up again? 
 I take it from your responsenthey don't look the same anymore, right? 
 (Applause) 
 Why? Because your brainnis seeing that same information,as if the right one is stillnunder red light,,and the left one is stillnunder green light.,That's your new normal.,Okay? So, what does this mean for context?,It means I can take two identical squares,,put them in light and dark surrounds,,and the one on the dark surroundnlooks lighter than on the light surround.,What's significant is not simply the lightnand dark surrounds that matter.,It's what those light and dark surroundsnmeant for your behavior in the past. 
 So I'll show you what I mean.,Here we have that exact same illusion.,We have two identical tiles on the left,,one in a dark surround,none in a light surround.,And the same thing over on the right.,Now, I'll reveal those two scenes,,but I'm not going to changenanything within those boxes,,except their meaning.,And see what happens to your perception. 
 Notice that on the left,the two tiles look nearlyncompletely opposite:,one very white and one very dark, right?,Whereas on the right,nthe two tiles look nearly the same.,And yet there is still onenon a dark surround,,and one on a light surround.,Why?,Because if the tile in that shadownwere in fact in shadow,,and reflecting the samenamount of light to your eye,as the one outside the shadow,,it would have to be more reflectiven-- just the laws of physics.,So you see it that way. 
 Whereas on the right,nthe information is consistent,with those two tilesnbeing under the same light.,If they're under the same light reflectingnthe same amount of light to your eye,,then they must be equally reflective.,So you see it that way.,Which means we can bringnall this information together,to create some incrediblynstrong illusions. 
 This is one I made a few years ago.,And you'll notice you seena dark brown tile at the top,,and a bright orange tile at the side.,That is your perceptual reality.,The physical realitynis that those two tiles are the same. 
 Here you see four gray tiles on your left,,seven gray tiles on the right.,I'm not going to changenthose tiles at all,,but I'm going to revealnthe rest of the scene.,And see what happens to your perception.,The four blue tiles on the left are gray.,The seven yellow tilesnon the right are also gray.,They are the same. Okay?,Don't believe me? Let's watch it again. 
 What's true for color is also truenfor complex perceptions of motion.,So, here we have --,let's turn this around -- a diamond.,And what I'm going to do is,nI'm going to hold it here,,and I'm going to spin it.,And for all of you, you'll see itnprobably spinning this direction.,Now I want you to keep looking at it.,Move your eyes around,nblink, maybe close one eye.,And suddenly it will flip, and startnspinning the opposite direction.,Yes? Raise your hand if you got that. Yes?,Keep blinking.,Every time you blink, it will switch.,So I can ask you,nwhich direction is it rotating?,How do you know?,Your brain doesn't know,nbecause both are equally likely.,So depending on where it looks,,it flips between the two possibilities. 
 Are we the only ones that see illusions?,The answer to this question is no.,Even the beautiful bumblebee,,with its mere one million brain cells,,which is 250 times fewer cellsnthan you have in one retina,,sees illusions, doesnthe most complicated things,that even our mostnsophisticated computers can't do.,So in my lab we work on bumblebees,,because we can completelyncontrol their experience,,and see how it altersnthe architecture of their brain.,We do this in what we call the Bee Matrix. 
 Here you have the hive.,You can see the queen bee,nthe large bee in the middle.,Those are her daughters, the eggs.,They go back and forth between this hivenand the arena, via this tube.,You'll see one of the bees come out here.,You see how she hasna little number on her?,There's another one coming out,nshe also has a number on her.,Now, they're not born that way, right?,We pull them out, put themnin the fridge, and they fall asleep.,Then you can supergluenlittle numbers on them. 
 (Laughter) 
 And now, in this experiment they getna reward if they go to the blue flowers.,They land on the flower,,stick their tongue in there,ncalled a proboscis, and drink sugar water.,She's drinking a glass of waternthat's about that big to you and I,,will do that about three times, then fly.,And sometimes they learnnnot to go to the blue,,but to go where the other bees go.,So they copy each other.,They can count to five.nThey can recognize faces.,And here she comes down the ladder.,And she'll come into the hive,nfind an empty honey pot,,and throw up, and that's honey. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now remember, she's supposednto be going to the blue flowers,,but what are these bees doingnin the upper right corner?,It looks like they'rengoing to green flowers.,Now, are they getting it wrong?,And the answer to the question is no.nThose are actually blue flowers.,But those are blue flowersnunder green light.,So they're using the relationshipsnbetween the colors to solve the puzzle,,which is exactly what we do. 
 So, illusions are often used,,especially in art, in the wordsnof a more contemporary artist,,"to demonstrate the fragilitynof our senses.",Okay, this is complete rubbish.,The senses aren't fragile.nAnd if they were, we wouldn't be here.,Instead, color tells usnsomething completely different,,that the brain didn't actually evolvento see the world the way it is.,We can't.,Instead, the brainnevolved to see the world,the way it was useful to see in the past.,And how we see is by continuallynredefining normality. 
 So, how can we take this incrediblencapacity of plasticity of the brain,and get people to experiencentheir world differently?,Well, one of the ways we do itnin my lab and studio,is we translate the light into sound,,and we enable people to hearntheir visual world.,And they can navigatenthe world using their ears. 
 Here's David on the right,nand he's holding a camera.,On the left is what his camera sees.,And you'll see there's a faint linengoing across that image.,That line is broken up into 32 squares.,In each square,nwe calculate the average color.,And then we just simplyntranslate that into sound.,And now he's going to turn around,,close his eyes,,and find a plate on the groundnwith his eyes closed.

 Beau Lotto: He finds it. Amazing, right?,So not only can we create a prostheticnfor the visually impaired,,but we can also investigate,how people literallynmake sense of the world.,But we can also do something else.,We can also make music with color.,So, working with kids,,they created images,,thinking about what mightnthe images you see,sound like if we could listen to them.,And then we translated these images.,And this is one of those images.,And this is a six-year-old childncomposing a piece of music,for a 32-piece orchestra.,And this is what it sounds like. 
 (Electronic representationnof orchestral music) 
 So, a six-year-old child. Okay? 
 Now, what does all this mean?,What this suggests is that no onenis an outside observer of nature, okay?,We're not definednby our central properties,,by the bits that make us up.,We're defined by our environmentnand our interaction with that environment,,by our ecology.,And that ecology is necessarilynrelative, historical and empirical.,So, what I'd like to finish withnis this over here.,Because what I've been trying to donis really celebrate uncertainty.,Because I think only through uncertaintynis there potential for understanding. 
 So, if some of you are stillnfeeling a bit too certain,,I'd like to do this one.,So, if we have the lights down.,And what we have here --,Can everyone see 25npurple surfaces on your left,,and 25, call it yellowish,nsurfaces on your right?,So now, what I want to do,,I'm going to putnthe middle nine surfaces here,under yellow illumination,,by simply putting a filter behind them.,Now you can see that changes the lightnthat's coming through there, right?,Because now the light is goingnthrough a yellowish filter,and then a purplish filter.,I'm going to do the oppositenon the left here.,I'm going to put the middle ninenunder a purplish light. 
 Now, some of you will have noticednthat the consequence,is that the light coming through thosenmiddle nine on the right,,or your left, is exactlynthe same as the light,coming through the middlennine on your right.,Agreed? Yes?,Okay. So they are physically the same.,Let's pull the covers off.,Now remember --,you know that the middle ninenare exactly the same.,Do they look the same?,No.,The question is, "Is that an illusion?",And I'll leave you with that. 
 So, thank you very much. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause)I'm a writer and a journalist,,and I'm also an insanely curious person,,so in 22 years as a journalist,,I've learned how to do a lot of new things.,And three years ago, one of the things I learned how to do,was to become invisible.,I became one of the working homeless.,I quit my job as a newspaper editor,after my father died in February of that same year,,and decided to travel.,His death hit me pretty hard.,And there were a lot of things that I wanted to feel and deal with while I was doing that. 
 I've camped my whole life. And I decided,that living in a van for a year to do this,would be like one long camping trip.,So I packed my cat, my Rottweiler,and my camping gear into a 1975 Chevy van,,and drove off into the sunset,,having fully failed to realize three critical things.,One: that society equates,living in a permanent structure, even a shack,,with having value as a person.,Two: I failed to realize how quickly,the negative perceptions of other people,can impact our reality, if we let it.,Three: I failed to realize,that homelessness is an attitude,,not a lifestyle. 
 At first, living in the van was great.,I showered in campgrounds. I ate out regularly.,And I had time to relax and to grieve.,But then the anger and the depression about my father's death set in.,My freelance job ended. And I had to get a full-time job,to pay the bills.,What had been a really mild spring,turned into a miserably hot summer.,And it became impossible to park anywhere --,(Laughs),-- without being very obvious,that I had a cat and a dog with me, and it was really hot.,The cat came and went through an open window in the van.,The doggy went into doggy day care.,And I sweated.,Whenever I could, I used,employee showers in office buildings and truck stops.,Or I washed up in public rest rooms. 
 Nighttime temperatures in the van rarely dropped below 80 degrees Fahrenheit,,making it difficult or impossible to sleep.,Food rotted in the heat.,Ice in my ice chest melted within hours,,and it was pretty miserable.,I couldn't afford to find an apartment,,or couldn't afford an apartment that would allow me,to have the Rottweiler and the cat.,And I refused to give them up,,so I stayed in the van.,And when the heat made me too sick,to walk the 50 feet to the public restroom,outside my van at night,,I used a bucket and a trash bag as a toilet. 
 When winter weather set in, the temperatures dropped,below freezing. And they stayed there.,And I faced a whole new set of challenges.,I parked a different place every night,so I would avoid being noticed and hassled by the police.,I didn't always succeed. 
 But I felt out of control of my life.,And I don't know when or how it happened,,but the speed at which I went,from being a talented writer and journalist,to being a homeless woman, living in a van,,took my breath away.,I hadn't changed. My I.Q. hadn't dropped.,My talent, my integrity, my values,,everything about me remained the same.,But I had changed somehow.,I spiraled deeper and deeper into a depression. 
 And eventually someone referred me to a homeless health clinic.,And I went. I hadn't bathed in three days.,I was as smelly and as depressed as anyone in line.,I just wasn't drunk or high.,And when several of the homeless men realized that,,including a former university professor,,they said, "You aren't homeless. Why are you really here?",Other homeless people didn't see me as homeless,,but I did.,Then the professor listened to my story and he said,,"You have a job. You have hope.,The real homeless don't have hope.",A reaction to the medication the clinic gave me for my depression,left me suicidal. And I remember thinking,,"If I killed myself, no one would notice." 
 A friend told me, shortly after that,,that she had heard that Tim Russert,,a nationally renowned journalist,,had been talking about me on national T.V.,An essay I'd written about my father,,the year before he died, was in Tim's new book.,And he was doing the talk show circuit. And he was talking about my writing.,And when I realized that Tim Russert, former moderator of "Meet the Press,",was talking about my writing,,while I was living in a van in a Wal-Mart parking lot,,I started laughing.,You should too.,(Laughter) 
 I started laughing,because it got to the point where,,was I a writer, or was I a homeless woman?,So I went in the bookstore. And I found Tim's book.,And I stood there. And I reread my essay.,And I cried.,Because I was a writer.,I was a writer.,Shortly after that I moved back to Tennessee.,I alternated between living in a van and couch surfing with friends.,And I started writing again.,By the summer of the following year I was a working journalist.,I was winning awards. I was living in my own apartment.,I was no longer homeless.,And I was no longer invisible. 
 Thousands of people work full and part-time jobs,,and live in their cars.,But society continues to stigmatize and criminalize,living in your vehicle or on the streets.,So the homeless, the working homeless, primarily remain invisible.,But if you ever meet one,,engage them, encourage them, and offer them hope.,The human spirit can overcome anything if it has hope.,And I'm not here to be the poster girl for the homeless.,I'm not here to encourage you to give money to the next panhandler you meet.,But I am here to tell you that, based on my experience,,people are not where they live,,where they sleep,,or what their life situation is at any given time.,Three years ago I was living in a van,in a Wal-Mart parking lot,,and today I'm speaking at TED.,Hope always, always finds a way. Thank you.,(Applause)The public debate about architecture,quite often just stays on contemplating the final result,,the architectural object.,Is the latest tower in London,a gherkin or a sausage,or a sex tool? 
 So recently, we asked ourselves,if we could invent a format,that could actually tell the stories behind the projects,,maybe combining images and drawings and words,to actually sort of tell stories about architecture.,And we discovered that we didn't have to invent it,,it already existed in the form of a comic book. 
 So we basically copied the format of the comic book,to actually tell the stories of behind the scenes,,how our projects actually evolve through adaptation,and improvisation.,Sort of through the turmoil and the opportunities,and the incidents of the real world.,We call this comic book "Yes is More,",which is obviously a sort of evolution of the ideas of some of our heroes. 
 In this case it's Mies van der Rohe's Less is More.,He triggered the modernist revolution.,After him followed the post-modern counter-revolution,,Robert Venturi saying, "Less is a bore.",After him, Philip Johnson sort of introduced,(Laughter),you could say promiscuity, or at least openness,to new ideas with, "I am a whore.",Recently, Obama has introduced optimism,at a sort of time of global financial crisis. 
 And what we'd like to say with "Yes is More",is basically trying to question this idea,that the architectural avant-garde is almost always negatively defined,,as who or what we are against.,The cliche of the radical architect,is the sort of angry young man rebelling against the establishment.,Or this idea of the misunderstood genius,,frustrated that the world doesn't fit in with his or her ideas.,Rather than revolution, we're much more interested in evolution,,this idea that things gradually evolve,by adapting and improvising,to the changes of the world. 
 In fact, I actually think that Darwin is one of the people,who best explains our design process.,His famous evolutionary tree,could almost be a diagram of the way we work.,As you can see, a project evolves through,a series of generations of design meetings.,At each meeting, there's way too many ideas.,Only the best ones can survive.,And through a process of architectural selection,,we might choose a really beautiful model,or we might have a very functional model.,We mate them. They have sort of mutant offspring.,And through these sort of generations of design meetings,we arrive at a design. 
 A very literal way of showing it is a project we did,for a library and a hotel in Copenhagen.,The design process was really tough,,almost like a struggle for survival,,but gradually an idea evolved:,this sort of idea of a rational tower,that melts together with the surrounding city,,sort of expanding the public space onto what we refer to as,a Scandinavian version of the Spanish Steps in Rome,,but sort of public on the outside, as well as on the inside,,with the library. 
 But Darwin doesn't only explain the evolution of a single idea.,As you can see, sometimes a subspecies branches off.,And quite often we sit in a design meeting,and we discover that there is this great idea.,It doesn't really work in this context.,But for another client in another culture,,it could really be the right answer to a different question.,So as a result, we never throw anything out.,We keep our office almost like an archive,of architectural biodiversity.,You never know when you might need it. 
 And what I'd like to do now, in an act of,warp-speed storytelling,,is tell the story of how two projects evolved,by adapting and improvising,to the happenstance of the world.,The first story starts last year when we went to Shanghai,to do the competition for the Danish,National Pavilion for the World Expo in 2010.,And we saw this guy, Haibao.,He's the mascot of the expo,,and he looks strangely familiar.,In fact he looked like a building we had designed,for a hotel in the north of Sweden.,When we submitted it for the Swedish competition we thought,it was a really cool scheme, but it didn't exactly,look like something from the north of Sweden.,The Swedish jury didn't think so either. So we lost. 
 But then we had a meeting with a Chinese businessman,who saw our design and said,,"Wow, that's the Chinese character for the word 'people.'",(Laughter),So, apparently this is how you write "people,",as in the People's Republic of China.,We even double checked.,And at the same time, we got invited to exhibit,at the Shanghai Creative Industry Week.,So we thought like, this is too much of an opportunity,,so we hired a feng shui master.,We scaled the building up three times to Chinese proportions,,and went to China.,(Laughter),So the People's Building, as we called it.,This is our two interpreters, sort of reading the architecture. 
 It went on the cover of the Wen Wei Po newspaper,,which got Mr. Liangyu Chen, the mayor of Shanghai,,to visit the exhibition.,And we had the chance to explain the project.,And he said, "Shanghai is the city in the world,with most skyscrapers,",but to him it was as if the connection to the roots had been cut over.,And with the People's Building, he saw an architecture,that could bridge the gap between the ancient wisdom of China,and the progressive future of China.,So we obviously profoundly agreed with him.,(Laughter),(Applause),Unfortunately, Mr. Chen is now in prison for corruption.,(Laughter) 
 But like I said, Haibao looked very familiar,,because he is actually the Chinese character for "people.",And they chose this mascot because,the theme of the expo is "Better City, Better Life.",Sustainability.,And we thought, sustainability has grown into being,this sort of neo-Protestant idea,that it has to hurt in order to do good. 
 You know, you're not supposed to take long, warm showers.,You're not supposed to fly on holidays because it's bad for the environment.,Gradually, you get this idea that sustainable life,is less fun than normal life.,So we thought that maybe it could be interesting to focus on examples,where a sustainable city,actually increases the quality of life. 
 We also asked ourselves, what could Denmark possibly show China,that would be relevant?,You know, it's one of the biggest countries in the world, one of the smallest.,China symbolized by the dragon.,Denmark, we have a national bird, the swan.,(Laughter),China has many great poets, 
 but we discovered that in the People's Republic,public school curriculum,,they have three fairy tales by An Tu Sheng,,or Hans Christian Anderson, as we call him.,So that means that all 1.3 billion Chinese,have grown up with "The Emperor's New Clothes,","The Matchstick Girl" and "The Little Mermaid.",It's almost like a fragment of Danish culture,integrated into Chinese culture. 
 The biggest tourist attraction in China is the Great Wall.,The Great Wall is the only thing that can be seen from the moon.,The big tourist attraction in Denmark is The Little Mermaid.,That can actually hardly be seen from the canal tours.,(Laughter) 
 And it sort of shows the difference between these two cities.,Copenhagen, Shanghai,,modern, European.,But then we looked at recent urban development,,and we noticed that this is like a Shanghai street,,30 years ago. All bikes, no cars.,This is how it looks today; all traffic jam.,Bicycles have become forbidden many places. 
 Meanwhile, in Copenhagen we're actually expanding the bicycle lanes.,A third of all the people commute by bike.,We have a free system of bicycles called the City Bike,that you can borrow if you visit the city.,So we thought, why don't we reintroduce the bicycle in China?,We donate 1,000 bikes to Shanghai.,So if you come to the expo, go straight to the Danish pavilion,,get a Danish bike, and then continue on that to visit the other pavilions. 
 Like I said, Shanghai and Copenhagen are both port cities,,but in Copenhagen the water has gotten so clean,that you can actually swim in it.,One of the first projects we ever did,was the harbor bath in Copenhagen,,sort of continuing the public realm into the water.,So we thought that these expos quite often have a lot of,state financed propaganda,,images, statements, but no real experience.,So just like with a bike, we don't talk about it.,You can try it.,Like with the water, instead of talking about it,,we're going to sail a million liters of harbor water,from Copenhagen to Shanghai,,so the Chinese who have the courage can actually dive in,and feel how clean it is. 
 This is where people normally object that it doesn't sound very sustainable,to sail water from Copenhagen to China.,But in fact, the container ships go,full of goods from China to Denmark,,and then they sail empty back.,So quite often you load water for ballast.,So we can actually hitch a ride for free. 
 And in the middle of this sort of harbor bath,,we're actually going to put the actual Little Mermaid.,So the real Mermaid, the real water, and the real bikes.,And when she's gone, we're going to invite,a Chinese artist to reinterpret her.,The architecture of the pavilion is this sort of loop,of exhibition and bikes.,When you go to the exhibition, you'll see the Mermaid and the pool.,You'll walk around, start looking for a bicycle on the roof,,jump on your ride and then continue out into the rest of the expo. 
 So when we actually won the competition,we had to do an exhibition in China explaining the project.,And to our surprise we got one of our boards back,with corrections from the Chinese state censorship.,The first thing, the China map missed Taiwan.,It's a very serious political issue in China. We will add on.,The second thing, we had compared the swan to the dragon,,and then the Chinese state said,,"Suggest change to panda.",(Laughter),(Applause) 
 So, when it came out in Denmark that we were actually going to,move our national monument,,the National People's Party sort of rebelled against it.,They tried to pass a law against moving the Mermaid.,So for the first time, I got invited to speak at the National Parliament.,It was kind of interesting because in the morning, from 9 to 11,,they were discussing the bailout package --,how many billions to invest in saving the Danish economy.,And then at 11 o'clock they stopped talking about these little issues.,And then from 11 to 1,,they were debating whether or not to send the Mermaid to China.,(Laughter),(Applause) 
 But to conclude, if you want to see the Mermaid from May to December,next year, don't come to Copenhagen,,because she's going to be in Shanghai.,If you do come to Copenhagen,,you will probably see an installation by Ai Weiwei, the Chinese artist.,But if the Chinese government intervenes, it might even be a panda.,(Laughter) 
 So the second story that I'd like to tell,is, actually starts in my own house.,This is my apartment.,This is the view from my apartment,,over the sort of landscape of triangular balconies,that our client called the Leonardo DiCaprio balcony.,And they form this sort of vertical backyard,where, on a nice summer day, you'll actually get introduced to all your neighbors,in a vertical radius of 10 meters.,The house is sort of a distortion of a square block.,Trying to zigzag it to make sure,that all of the apartments look at the straight views,,instead of into each other. 
 Until recently, this was the view from my apartment,,onto this place where our client actually bought the neighbor site.,And he said that he was going to do an apartment block,next to a parking structure.,And we thought, rather than doing a traditional stack of apartments,looking straight into a big boring block of cars,,why don't we turn all the apartments into penthouses,,put them on a podium of cars. 
 And because Copenhagen is completely flat,,if you want to have a nice south-facing slope with a view,,you basically have to do it yourself.,Then we sort of cut up the volume,,so we wouldn't block the view from my apartment.,(Laughter),And essentially the parking is sort of occupying the deep space,underneath the apartments. 
 And up in the sun, you have a single layer of apartments,that combine all the splendors of a suburban lifestyle,,like a house with a garden with a sort of metropolitan view,,and a sort of dense urban location.,This is our first architectural model.,This is an aerial photo taken last summer.,And essentially, the apartments cover the parking.,They are accessed through this diagonal elevator.,It's actually a stand-up product from Switzerland,,because in Switzerland they have a natural need for diagonal elevators.,(Laughter) 
 And the facade of the parking,,we wanted to make the parking naturally ventilated,,so we needed to perforate it.,And we discovered that by controlling the size of the holes,,we could actually turn the entire facade,into a gigantic, naturally ventilated,,rasterized image.,And since we always refer to the project as The Mountain,,we commissioned this Japanese Himalaya photographer,to give us this beautiful photo of Mount Everest,,making the entire building a 3,000 square meter artwork.,(Applause) 
 So if you go back into the parking, into the corridors,,it's almost like traveling into a parallel universe,from cars and colors,,into this sort of south-facing urban oasis.,The wood of your apartment continues outside becoming the facades.,If you go even further, it turns into this green garden.,And all the rainwater that drops on the Mountain,is actually accumulated.,And there is an automatic irrigation system,that makes sure that this sort of landscape of gardens,,in one or two years it will sort of transform,into a Cambodian temple ruin,,completely covered in green. 
 So, the Mountain is like our first built example,of what we like to refer to as architectural alchemy.,This idea that you can actually create, if not gold,,then at least added value by mixing,traditional ingredients, like normal apartments,and normal parking,,and in this case actually offer people,the chance that they don't have to choose between,a life with a garden or a life in the city.,They can actually have both. 
 As an architect, it's really hard to set the agenda.,You can't just say that now I'd like to do a sustainable city,in central Asia,,because that's not really how you get commissions.,You always have to sort of adapt and improvise,to the opportunities and accidents that happen,,and the sort of turmoil of the world. 
 One last example is that recently we,,like last summer, we won the competition,to design a Nordic national bank.,This was the director of the bank when he was still smiling.,(Laughter),It was in the middle of the capital so we were really excited by this opportunity.,Unfortunately, it was the national bank of Iceland. 
 At the same time, we actually had a visitor --,a minister from Azerbaijan came to our office.,We took him to see the Mountain. And he got very excited,by this idea that you could actually make mountains,out of architecture,,because Azerbaijan is known as the Alps of Central Asia.,So he asked us if we could actually imagine,an urban master plan,on an island outside the capital,that would recreate the silhouette of the seven most significant mountains,of Azerbaijan. 
 So we took the commission.,And we made this small movie that I'd like to show.,We quite often make little movies.,We always argue a lot about the soundtrack,,but in this case it was really easy to choose the song.,So basically, Baku is this sort of crescent bay,overlooking the island of Zira, the island that we are planning --,almost like the diagram of their flag.,And our main idea was,to sort of sample the seven most significant mountains,of the topography of Azerbaijan,and reinterpret them into urban and architectural structures,,inhabitable of human life.,Then we place these mountains on the island,,surrounding this sort of central green valley,,almost like a central park. 
 And what makes it interesting is that the island right now,is just a piece of desert. It has no vegetation.,It has no water. It has no energy, no resources.,So we actually sort of designed the entire island as a single ecosystem,,exploiting wind energy to drive the desalination plants,,and to use the thermal properties of water,to heat and cool the buildings.,And all the sort of excess freshwater wastewater,is filtered organically into the landscape,,gradually transforming the desert island,into sort of a green, lush landscape. 
 So, you can say where an urban development,normally happens at the expense of nature,,in this case it's actually creating nature.,And the buildings, they don't only sort of,invoke the imagery of the mountains,,they also operate like mountains.,They create shelter from the wind.,They accumulate the solar energy.,They accumulate the water.,So they actually transform the entire island,into a single ecosystem. 
 So we recently presented the master plan,,and it has gotten approved.,And this summer we are starting the construction documents,of the two first mountains,,in what's going to be the first carbon-neutral island,in Central Asia.,(Applause),Yes, maybe just to round off.,So in a way you can see how the Mountain in Copenhagen,sort of evolved into the Seven Peaks of Azerbaijan.,With a little luck and some more evolution,,maybe in 10 years it could be the Five Mountains on Mars.,Thank you.,(Applause)I've been fascinated with crop diversity for about 35 years from now,,ever since I stumbled across a fairly obscure academic article,by a guy named Jack Harlan.,And he described the diversity within crops --,all the different kinds of wheat and rice and such --,as a genetic resource.,And he said, "This genetic resource," --,and I'll never forget the words --,"stands between us and catastrophic starvation,on a scale we cannot imagine." 
 I figured he was either really on to something,,or he was one of these academic nutcases.,So, I looked a little further,,and what I figured out was that he wasn't a nutcase.,He was the most respected scientist in the field.,What he understood was that biological diversity -- crop diversity --,is the biological foundation of agriculture.,It's the raw material, the stuff, of evolution in our agricultural crops.,Not a trivial matter.,And he also understood that that foundation was crumbling,,literally crumbling.,That indeed, a mass extinction was underway,in our fields, in our agricultural system.,And that this mass extinction was taking place,with very few people noticing,and even fewer caring. 
 Now, I know that many of you don't stop,to think about diversity in agricultural systems,and, let's face it, that's logical.,You don't see it in the newspaper every day.,And when you go into the supermarket, you certainly don't see a lot of choices there.,You see apples that are red, yellow, and green and that's about it. 
 So, let me show you a picture of one form of diversity.,Here's some beans,,and there are about 35 or 40 different,varieties of beans on this picture.,Now, imagine each one of these varieties as being distinct from another,about the same way as a poodle from a Great Dane.,If I wanted to show you a picture of all the dog breeds in the world,,and I put 30 or 40 of them on a slide, it would take about 10 slides,because there about 400 breeds of dogs in the world.,But there are 35 to 40,000 different varieties of beans.,So if I were to going to show you all the beans in the world,,and I had a slide like this, and I switched it every second,,it would take up my entire TED talk,,and I wouldn't have to say anything. 
 But the interesting thing is that this diversity -- and the tragic thing is --,that this diversity is being lost.,We have about 200,000 different varieties of wheat,,and we have about 2 to 400,000 different varieties of rice,,but it's being lost.,And I want to give you an example of that.,It's a bit of a personal example, in fact.,In the United States, in the 1800s -- that's where we have the best data --,farmers and gardeners were growing 7,100,named varieties of apples.,Imagine that. 7,100 apples with names.,Today, 6,800 of those are extinct,,no longer to be seen again. 
 I used to have a list of these extinct apples,,and when I would go out and give a presentation,,I would pass the list out in the audience.,I wouldn't tell them what it was, but it was in alphabetical order,,and I would tell them to look for their names, their family names,,their mother's maiden name.,And at the end of the speech, I would ask, "How many people have found a name?",And I never had fewer than two-thirds of an audience hold up their hand.,And I said, "You know what? These apples come from your ancestors,,and your ancestors gave them the greatest honor they could give them.,They gave them their name.,The bad news is they're extinct.,The good news is a third of you didn't hold up your hand. Your apple's still out there.,Find it. Make sure it doesn't join the list." 
 So, I want to tell you that the piece of the good news is,that the Fowler apple is still out there.,And there's an old book back here,,and I want to read a piece from it.,This book was published in 1904.,It's called "The Apples of New York" and this is the second volume.,See, we used to have a lot of apples.,And the Fowler apple is described in here --,I hope this doesn't surprise you --,as, "a beautiful fruit.",(Laughter),I don't know if we named the apple or if the apple named us, but ...,but, to be honest, the description goes on,and it says that it "doesn't rank high in quality, however.",And then he has to go even further.,It sounds like it was written by an old school teacher of mine.,"As grown in New York, the fruit usually fails to develop properly in size and quality,and is, on the whole, unsatisfactory." 
 (Laughter) 
 And I guess there's a lesson to be learned here,,and the lesson is: so why save it?,I get this question all the time. Why don't we just save the best one?,And there are a couple of answers to that question.,One thing is that there is no such thing as a best one.,Today's best variety is tomorrow's lunch for insects or pests or disease.,The other thing is that maybe that Fowler apple,or maybe a variety of wheat that's not economical right now,has disease or pest resistance,or some quality that we're going to need for climate change that the others don't.,So it's not necessary, thank God,,that the Fowler apple is the best apple in the world.,It's just necessary or interesting that it might have one good, unique trait.,And for that reason, we ought to be saving it.,Why? As a raw material, as a trait we can use in the future.,Think of diversity as giving us options.,And options, of course, are exactly what we need in an era of climate change. 
 I want to show you two slides,,but first, I want to tell you that we've been working at the Global Crop Diversity Trust,with a number of scientists -- particularly at Stanford and University of Washington --,to ask the question: What's going to happen to agriculture in an era of climate change,and what kind of traits and characteristics do we need in our agricultural crops,to be able to adapt to this?,In short, the answer is that in the future, in many countries,,the coldest growing seasons are going to be hotter,than anything those crops have seen in the past.,The coldest growing seasons of the future,,hotter than the hottest of the past.,Is agriculture adapted to that?,I don't know. Can fish play the piano?,If agriculture hasn't experienced that, how could it be adapted? 
 Now, the highest concentration of poor and hungry people in the world,,and the place where climate change, ironically, is going to be the worst,is in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.,So I've picked two examples here, and I want to show you.,In the histogram before you now,,the blue bars represent the historical range of temperatures,,going back about far as we have temperature data.,And you can see that there's some difference,between one growing season and another.,Some are colder, some are hotter and it's a bell shaped curve.,The tallest bar is the average temperature for the most number of growing seasons.,In the future, later this century, it's going to look like the red,,totally out of bounds.,The agricultural system and, more importantly, the crops in the field in India,have never experienced this before. 
 Here's South Africa. The same story.,But the most interesting thing about South Africa is,we don't have to wait for 2070 for there to be trouble.,By 2030, if the maize, or corn, varieties, which is the dominant crop --,50 percent of the nutrition in Southern Africa are still in the field --,in 2030, we'll have a 30 percent decrease in production of maize,because of the climate change already in 2030.,30 percent decrease of production in the context of increasing population,,that's a food crisis. It's global in nature.,We will watch children starve to death on TV.,Now, you may say that 20 years is a long way off.,It's two breeding cycles for maize.,We have two rolls of the dice to get this right.,We have to get climate-ready crops in the field,,and we have to do that rather quickly. 
 Now, the good news is that we have conserved.,We have collected and conserved a great deal of biological diversity,,agricultural diversity, mostly in the form of seed,,and we put it in seed banks, which is a fancy way of saying a freezer.,If you want to conserve seed for a long term,and you want to make it available to plant breeders and researchers,,you dry it and then you freeze it.,Unfortunately, these seed banks are located around the world in buildings,and they're vulnerable.,Disasters have happened. In recent years we lost the gene bank,,the seed bank in Iraq and Afghanistan. You can guess why.,In Rwanda, in the Solomon Islands.,And then there are just daily disasters that take place in these buildings,,financial problems and mismanagement and equipment failures,,and all kinds of things, and every time something like this happens,,it means extinction. We lose diversity.,And I'm not talking about losing diversity in the same way that you lose your car keys.,I'm talking about losing it in the same way that we lost the dinosaurs:,actually losing it, never to be seen again. 
 So, a number of us got together and decided that, you know, enough is enough,and we need to do something about that and we need to have a facility,that can really offer protection for our biological diversity of --,maybe not the most charismatic diversity.,You don't look in the eyes of a carrot seed quite in the way you do a panda bear,,but it's very important diversity.,So we needed a really safe place, and we went quite far north to find it.,To Svalbard, in fact.,This is above mainland Norway. You can see Greenland there.,That's at 78 degrees north.,It's as far as you can fly on a regularly scheduled airplane.,It's a remarkably beautiful landscape. I can't even begin to describe it to you.,It's otherworldly, beautiful.,We worked with the Norwegian government,and with the NorGen, the Norwegian Genetic Resources Program,,to design this facility.,What you see is an artist's conception of this facility,,which is built in a mountain in Svalbard.,The idea of Svalbard was that it's cold,,so we get natural freezing temperatures.,But it's remote. It's remote and accessible,so it's safe and we don't depend on mechanical refrigeration. 
 This is more than just an artist's dream, it's now a reality.,And this next picture shows it in context, in Svalbard.,And here's the front door of this facility.,When you open up the front door,,this is what you're looking at. It's pretty simple. It's a hole in the ground.,It's a tunnel, and you go into the tunnel,,chiseled in solid rock, about 130 meters.,There are now a couple of security doors, so you won't see it quite like this.,Again, when you get to the back, you get into an area that's really my favorite place.,I think of it as sort of a cathedral.,And I know that this tags me as a bit of a nerd, but ...,(Laughter),Some of the happiest days of my life have been spent ...,(Laughter),in this place there. 
 (Applause) 
 If you were to walk into one of these rooms, you would see this.,It's not very exciting, but if you know what's there, it's pretty emotional.,We have now about 425,000,samples of unique crop varieties.,There's 70,000 samples of different varieties of rice,in this facility right now.,About a year from now, we'll have over half a million samples.,We're going up to over a million, and someday we'll basically have samples --,about 500 seeds --,of every variety of agricultural crop that can be stored in a frozen state,in this facility.,This is a backup system for world agriculture.,It's a backup system for all the seed banks. Storage is free.,It operates like a safety deposit box.,Norway owns the mountain and the facility, but the depositors own the seed.,And if anything happens, then they can come back and get it.,This particular picture that you see shows the national collection of the United States,,of Canada, and an international institution from Syria. 
 I think it's interesting in that this facility, I think,,is almost the only thing I can think of these days where countries,,literally, every country in the world --,because we have seeds from every country in the world --,all the countries of the world have gotten together,to do something that's both long term, sustainable and positive.,I can't think of anything else that's happened in my lifetime that way. 
 I can't look you in the eyes and tell you that I have a solution,for climate change, for the water crisis.,Agriculture takes 70 percent of fresh water supplies on earth.,I can't look you in the eyes and tell you that there is such a solution,for those things, or the energy crisis, or world hunger, or peace in conflict.,I can't look you in the eyes and tell you that I have a simple solution for that,,but I can look you in the eyes and tell you that we can't solve any of those problems,if we don't have crop diversity.,Because I challenge you to think of an effective, efficient, sustainable,solution to climate change if we don't have crop diversity.,Because, quite literally, if agriculture doesn't adapt to climate change,,neither will we.,And if crops don't adapt to climate change, neither will agriculture,,neither will we. 
 So, this is not something pretty and nice to do.,There are a lot of people who would love to have this diversity exist,just for the existence value of it.,It is, I agree, a nice thing to do.,But it's a necessary thing to do.,So, in a very real sense, I believe that we, as an international community,,should get organized to complete the task.,The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is a wonderful gift,that Norway and others have given us,,but it's not the complete answer.,We need to collect the remaining diversity that's out there.,We need to put it into good seed banks,that can offer those seeds to researchers in the future.,We need to catalog it. It's a library of life,,but right now I would say we don't have a card catalog for it.,And we need to support it financially. 
 My big idea would be that while we think of it as commonplace,to endow an art museum or endow a chair at a university,,we really ought to be thinking about endowing wheat.,30 million dollars in an endowment would take care,of preserving all the diversity in wheat forever.,So we need to be thinking a little bit in those terms. 
 And my final thought is that we, of course, by conserving wheat,,rice, potatoes, and the other crops,,we may, quite simply, end up saving ourselves. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm a storyteller.,And I would like to tell youna few personal stories,about what I like to calln"the danger of the single story.",I grew up on a university campusnin eastern Nigeria.,My mother says that I startednreading at the age of two,,although I think fournis probably close to the truth.,So I was an early reader,,and what I read were Britishnand American children's books. 
 I was also an early writer,,and when I began to write,nat about the age of seven,,stories in pencilnwith crayon illustrations,that my poor mother was obligated to read,,I wrote exactly the kindsnof stories I was reading:,All my characters werenwhite and blue-eyed,,they played in the snow,,they ate apples, 
 (Laughter) 
 and they talked a lot about the weather,,how lovely it wasnthat the sun had come out. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, this despite the factnthat I lived in Nigeria.,I had never been outside Nigeria.,We didn't have snow, we ate mangoes,,and we never talked about the weather,,because there was no need to. 
 My characters also drankna lot of ginger beer,,because the charactersnin the British books I read,drank ginger beer.,Never mind that I had no ideanwhat ginger beer was. 
 (Laughter) 
 And for many years afterwards,,I would have a desperate desirento taste ginger beer.,But that is another story. 
 What this demonstrates, I think,,is how impressionablenand vulnerable we are,in the face of a story,,particularly as children.,Because all I had read were booksnin which characters were foreign,,I had become convinced that books,by their very naturenhad to have foreigners in them,and had to be about things with whichnI could not personally identify.,Now, things changednwhen I discovered African books.,There weren't many of them available,,and they weren't quite as easy to findnas the foreign books. 
 But because of writers likenChinua Achebe and Camara Laye,,I went through a mental shiftnin my perception of literature.,I realized that people like me,,girls with skin the color of chocolate,,whose kinky hair could not form ponytails,,could also exist in literature.,I started to writenabout things I recognized. 
 Now, I loved thosenAmerican and British books I read.,They stirred my imagination.nThey opened up new worlds for me.,But the unintended consequence,was that I did not knownthat people like me,could exist in literature.,So what the discovery of African writersndid for me was this:,It saved me from having a single storynof what books are. 
 I come from a conventional,nmiddle-class Nigerian family.,My father was a professor.,My mother was an administrator.,And so we had, as was the norm,,live-in domestic help, who would oftenncome from nearby rural villages.,So, the year I turned eight,nwe got a new house boy.,His name was Fide.,The only thing my mother told us about himnwas that his family was very poor.,My mother sent yams and rice,nand our old clothes, to his family.,And when I didn't finish my dinner,nmy mother would say,,"Finish your food! Don't you know?nPeople like Fide's family have nothing.",So I felt enormous pity for Fide's family. 
 Then one Saturday,nwe went to his village to visit,,and his mother showed usna beautifully patterned basket,made of dyed raffianthat his brother had made.,I was startled.,It had not occurred to menthat anybody in his family,could actually make something.,All I had heard about themnwas how poor they were,,so that it had become impossible for mento see them as anything else but poor.,Their poverty was my single story of them. 
 Years later, I thought about thisnwhen I left Nigeria,to go to university in the United States.,I was 19.,My American roommate was shocked by me.,She asked where I had learnednto speak English so well,,and was confused when I said that Nigeria,happened to have Englishnas its official language.,She asked if she could listennto what she called my "tribal music,",and was consequently very disappointed,when I produced my tape of Mariah Carey. 
 (Laughter) 
 She assumed that I did not knownhow to use a stove. 
 What struck me was this:,She had felt sorry for meneven before she saw me.,Her default positionntoward me, as an African,,was a kind of patronizing,nwell-meaning pity.,My roommate had a single story of Africa:,a single story of catastrophe.,In this single story,,there was no possibility of Africansnbeing similar to her in any way,,no possibility of feelingsnmore complex than pity,,no possibility of a connectionnas human equals. 
 I must say that before I went to the U.S.,,I didn't consciously identify as African.,But in the U.S., whenever Africa came up,npeople turned to me.,Never mind that I knew nothingnabout places like Namibia.,But I did come to embracenthis new identity,,and in many ways I thinknof myself now as African.,Although I still get quite irritablenwhen Africa is referred to as a country,,the most recent example beingnmy otherwise wonderful flight,from Lagos two days ago,,in which there was an announcementnon the Virgin flight,about the charity work in "India,nAfrica and other countries." 
 (Laughter) 
 So, after I had spent some yearsnin the U.S. as an African,,I began to understandnmy roommate's response to me.,If I had not grown up in Nigeria,,and if all I knew about Africanwere from popular images,,I too would think that Africanwas a place of beautiful landscapes,,beautiful animals,,and incomprehensible people,,fighting senseless wars,ndying of poverty and AIDS,,unable to speak for themselves,and waiting to be savednby a kind, white foreigner.,I would see Africansnin the same way that I,,as a child, had seen Fide's family. 
 This single story of Africa ultimatelyncomes, I think, from Western literature.,Now, here is a quote from the writingnof a London merchant called John Lok,,who sailed to west Africa in 1561,and kept a fascinatingnaccount of his voyage.,After referring to the black Africansnas "beasts who have no houses,",he writes, "They are alsonpeople without heads,,having their mouth and eyesnin their breasts." 
 Now, I've laughednevery time I've read this.,And one must admirenthe imagination of John Lok.,But what is important about his writing,is that it represents the beginning,of a tradition of tellingnAfrican stories in the West:,A tradition of Sub-Saharan Africanas a place of negatives,,of difference, of darkness,,of people who, in the wordsnof the wonderful poet Rudyard Kipling,,are "half devil, half child." 
 And so, I began to realizenthat my American roommate,must have throughout her life,seen and heard different versionsnof this single story,,as had a professor,,who once told me that my novelnwas not "authentically African.",Now, I was quite willing to contend,that there were a number of thingsnwrong with the novel,,that it had failed in a number of places,,but I had not quite imaginednthat it had failed,at achieving somethingncalled African authenticity.,In fact, I did not knownwhat African authenticity was.,The professor told me that my charactersnwere too much like him,,an educated and middle-class man.,My characters drove cars.,They were not starving.,Therefore they were notnauthentically African. 
 But I must quickly addnthat I too am just as guilty,in the question of the single story.,A few years ago,nI visited Mexico from the U.S.,The political climate in the U.S.nat the time was tense,,and there were debates going onnabout immigration.,And, as often happens in America,,immigration becamensynonymous with Mexicans.,There were endless stories of Mexicans,as people who werenfleecing the healthcare system,,sneaking across the border,,being arrested at the border,nthat sort of thing. 
 I remember walking aroundnon my first day in Guadalajara,,watching the people going to work,,rolling up tortillas in the marketplace,,smoking, laughing.,I remember first feeling slight surprise.,And then, I was overwhelmed with shame.,I realized that I had been so immersednin the media coverage of Mexicans,that they had become one thing in my mind,,the abject immigrant.,I had bought intonthe single story of Mexicans,and I could not havenbeen more ashamed of myself. 
 So that is how to create a single story,,show a people as one thing,,as only one thing,,over and over again,,and that is what they become. 
 It is impossible to talknabout the single story,without talking about power.,There is a word, an Igbo word,,that I think about whenever I think aboutnthe power structures of the world,,and it is "nkali.",It's a noun that loosely translatesnto "to be greater than another.",Like our economic and political worlds,,stories too are definednby the principle of nkali:,How they are told, who tells them,,when they're told,nhow many stories are told,,are really dependent on power. 
 Power is the ability not just to tellnthe story of another person,,but to make it the definitivenstory of that person.,The Palestinian poetnMourid Barghouti writes,that if you want to dispossess a people,,the simplest way to do itnis to tell their story,and to start with, "secondly.",Start the story with the arrowsnof the Native Americans,,and not with the arrival of the British,,and you have an entirely different story.,Start the story withnthe failure of the African state,,and not with the colonialncreation of the African state,,and you have an entirely different story. 
 I recently spoke at a university,where a student told menthat it was such a shame,that Nigerian men were physical abusers,like the father character in my novel.,I told him that I had just read a novelncalled "American Psycho" -- 
 (Laughter) 
 -- and that it was such a shame,that young Americansnwere serial murderers. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Now, obviously I said thisnin a fit of mild irritation. 
 (Laughter) 
 But it would never havenoccurred to me to think,that just because I had read a novelnin which a character was a serial killer,that he was somehownrepresentative of all Americans.,This is not because I amna better person than that student,,but because of America's culturalnand economic power,,I had many stories of America.,I had read Tyler and Updikenand Steinbeck and Gaitskill.,I did not have a single story of America. 
 When I learned, some years ago,,that writers were expectednto have had really unhappy childhoods,to be successful,,I began to think about how I could inventnhorrible things my parents had done to me. 
 (Laughter) 
 But the truth is that I hadna very happy childhood,,full of laughter and love,nin a very close-knit family. 
 But I also had grandfathersnwho died in refugee camps.,My cousin Polle died becausenhe could not get adequate healthcare.,One of my closest friends,nOkoloma, died in a plane crash,because our fire trucksndid not have water.,I grew up under repressivenmilitary governments,that devalued education,,so that sometimes, my parentsnwere not paid their salaries.,And so, as a child, I saw jamndisappear from the breakfast table,,then margarine disappeared,,then bread became too expensive,,then milk became rationed.,And most of all, a kindnof normalized political fear,invaded our lives. 
 All of these stories make me who I am.,But to insist on onlynthese negative stories,is to flatten my experience,and to overlook the many othernstories that formed me.,The single story creates stereotypes,,and the problem with stereotypesnis not that they are untrue,,but that they are incomplete.,They make one story become the only story. 
 Of course, Africa is a continentnfull of catastrophes:,There are immense ones,nsuch as the horrific rapes in Congo,and depressing ones,,such as the fact that 5,000 people applynfor one job vacancy in Nigeria.,But there are other storiesnthat are not about catastrophe,,and it is very important, it is justnas important, to talk about them. 
 I've always felt that it is impossible,to engage properlynwith a place or a person,without engaging with all of the storiesnof that place and that person.,The consequencenof the single story is this:,It robs people of dignity.,It makes our recognitionnof our equal humanity difficult.,It emphasizes how we are differentnrather than how we are similar. 
 So what if before my Mexican trip,,I had followed the immigrationndebate from both sides,,the U.S. and the Mexican?,What if my mother had told usnthat Fide's family was poor,and hardworking?,What if we had an Africanntelevision network,that broadcast diversenAfrican stories all over the world?,What the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebencalls "a balance of stories." 
 What if my roommate knewnabout my Nigerian publisher,,Muhtar Bakare,,a remarkable man who leftnhis job in a bank,to follow his dreamnand start a publishing house?,Now, the conventional wisdomnwas that Nigerians don't read literature.,He disagreed.,He felt that peoplenwho could read, would read,,if you made literature affordablenand available to them. 
 Shortly after he published my first novel,,I went to a TV stationnin Lagos to do an interview,,and a woman who worked therenas a messenger came up to me and said,,"I really liked your novel.nI didn't like the ending.,Now, you must write a sequel,nand this is what will happen ..." 
 (Laughter) 
 And she went on to tell menwhat to write in the sequel.,I was not only charmed, I was very moved.,Here was a woman, part of the ordinarynmasses of Nigerians,,who were not supposed to be readers.,She had not only read the book,,but she had taken ownership of it,and felt justified in telling menwhat to write in the sequel. 
 Now, what if my roommate knewnabout my friend Funmi Iyanda,,a fearless woman who hostsna TV show in Lagos,,and is determined to tell the storiesnthat we prefer to forget?,What if my roommate knewnabout the heart procedure,that was performed in the Lagosnhospital last week?,What if my roommate knewnabout contemporary Nigerian music,,talented people singingnin English and Pidgin,,and Igbo and Yoruba and Ijo,,mixing influences from Jay-Z to Fela,to Bob Marley to their grandfathers. 
 What if my roommate knewnabout the female lawyer,who recently went to court in Nigerianto challenge a ridiculous law,that required women to getntheir husband's consent,before renewing their passports?,What if my roommate knew about Nollywood,,full of innovative people makingnfilms despite great technical odds,,films so popular,that they really are the best examplenof Nigerians consuming what they produce?,What if my roommate knew aboutnmy wonderfully ambitious hair braider,,who has just started her own businessnselling hair extensions?,Or about the millions of other Nigeriansnwho start businesses and sometimes fail,,but continue to nurse ambition? 
 Every time I am home I am confronted,with the usual sources of irritationnfor most Nigerians:,our failed infrastructure,nour failed government,,but also by the incredible resilience,of people who thrivendespite the government,,rather than because of it.,I teach writing workshopsnin Lagos every summer,,and it is amazing to menhow many people apply,,how many people are eager to write,,to tell stories. 
 My Nigerian publisher and Inhave just started a non-profit,called Farafina Trust,,and we have big dreamsnof building libraries,and refurbishing librariesnthat already exist,and providing books for state schools,that don't have anythingnin their libraries,,and also of organizing lotsnand lots of workshops,,in reading and writing,,for all the people who are eagernto tell our many stories. 
 Stories matter.,Many stories matter.,Stories have been usednto dispossess and to malign,,but stories can also be usednto empower and to humanize.,Stories can break the dignity of a people,,but stories can also repairnthat broken dignity. 
 The American writernAlice Walker wrote this,about her Southern relativesnwho had moved to the North.,She introduced them to a book about,the Southern lifenthat they had left behind.,"They sat around,nreading the book themselves,,listening to me read the book,nand a kind of paradise was regained." 
 I would like to end with this thought:,That when we reject the single story,,when we realize thatnthere is never a single story,about any place,,we regain a kind of paradise. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm sure that, throughout the hundred-thousand-odd years,of our species' existence,,and even before,,our ancestors looked up at the night sky,,and wondered what stars are.,Wondering, therefore,,how to explain what they saw,in terms of things unseen. 
 Okay, so, most people,only wondered that occasionally, like today,,in breaks from whatever,normally preoccupied them.,But what normally preoccupied them,also involved yearning to know.,They wished they knew,how to prevent their food supply,from sometimes failing,,and how they could rest when they were tired,without risking starvation,,be warmer, cooler, safer,,in less pain.,I bet those prehistoric cave artists,would have loved to know,how to draw better. 
 In every aspect of their lives,,they wished for progress, just as we do.,But they failed, almost completely, to make any.,They didn't know how to.,Discoveries like fire,happened so rarely, that from an individual's point of view,,the world never improved.,Nothing new was learned. 
 The first clue to the origin of starlight,happened as recently as 1899: radioactivity.,Within 40 years,,physicists discovered the whole explanation,,expressed, as usual, in elegant symbols.,But never mind the symbols.,Think how many discoveries,they represent.,Nuclei and nuclear reactions, of course.,But isotopes, particles of electricity,,antimatter,,neutrinos,,the conversion of mass to energy -- that's E=mc^2 --,gamma rays,,transmutation.,That ancient dream that had always eluded the alchemists,was achieved through these same theories,that explained starlight,and other ancient mysteries,,and new, unexpected phenomena. 
 That all that, discovered in 40 years,,had not been in the previous hundred thousand,,was not for lack of thinking,about stars, and all those other urgent problems they had.,They even arrived at answers,,such as myths,,that dominated their lives,,yet bore almost no resemblance,to the truth.,The tragedy of that protracted stagnation,isn't sufficiently recognized, I think.,These were people with brains of,essentially the same design,that eventually did discover all those things.,But that ability to make progress,remained almost unused,,until the event that,revolutionized the human condition,and changed the universe. 
 Or so we should hope.,Because that event was the,Scientific Revolution,,ever since which our knowledge,of the physical world,,and of how to adapt it to our wishes,,has been growing relentlessly.,Now, what had changed?,What were people now doing for the first time,that made that difference,between stagnation,and rapid, open-ended discovery?,How to make that difference,is surely the most important universal truth,that it is possible to know.,Worryingly, there is no consensus about what it is.,So, I'll tell you.,But I'll have to backtrack a little first. 
 Before the Scientific Revolution,,they believed that everything important, knowable,,was already known,,enshrined in ancient writings, institutions,,and in some genuinely useful rules of thumb --,which were, however, entrenched as dogmas,,along with many falsehoods.,So they believed that knowledge came from authorities,that actually knew very little.,And therefore progress,depended on learning how to reject,the authority of learned men,,priests, traditions and rulers.,Which is why the Scientific Revolution,had to have a wider context. 
 The Enlightenment, a revolution in how,people sought knowledge,,trying not to rely on authority.,"Take no one's word for it.",But that can't be what made the difference.,Authorities had been rejected before, many times.,And that rarely, if ever,,caused anything like the Scientific Revolution.,At the time, what they thought,distinguished science,was a radical idea about things unseen,,known as empiricism.,All knowledge derives from the senses.,Well, we've seen that that can't be true.,It did help by promoting,observation and experiment.,But, from the outset, it was obvious,that there was something horribly wrong with it. 
 Knowledge comes from the senses.,In what language? Certainly not the language of mathematics,,in which, Galileo rightly said,,the book of nature is written.,Look at the world. You don't see equations,carved on to the mountainsides.,If you did, it would be because people,had carved them.,By the way, why don't we do that?,What's wrong with us?,(Laughter) 
 Empiricism is inadequate,because, well,,scientific theories explain the seen in terms of the unseen.,And the unseen, you have to admit,,doesn't come to us through the senses.,We don't see those nuclear reactions in stars.,We don't see the origin of species.,We don't see the curvature of space-time,,and other universes.,But we know about those things.,How? 
 Well, the classic empiricist answer is induction.,The unseen resembles the seen.,But it doesn't.,You know what the clinching evidence was,that space-time is curved?,It was a photograph, not of space-time,,but of an eclipse, with a dot there rather than there.,And the evidence for evolution?,Some rocks and some finches.,And parallel universes? Again: dots there,,rather than there, on a screen.,What we see, in all these cases,,bears no resemblance to the reality,that we conclude is responsible --,only a long chain of theoretical reasoning,and interpretation connects them. 
 "Ah!" say creationists.,"So you admit it's all interpretation.,No one has ever seen evolution.,We see rocks.,You have your interpretation. We have ours.,Yours comes from guesswork,,ours from the Bible.",But what creationist and empiricists both ignore,is that, in that sense,,no one has ever seen a bible either,,that the eye only detects light, which we don't perceive.,Brains only detect nerve impulses.,And they don't perceive even those as what they really are,,namely electrical crackles.,So we perceive nothing as what it really is. 
 Our connection to reality,is never just perception.,It's always, as Karl Popper put it,,theory-laden.,Scientific knowledge isn't derived from anything.,It's like all knowledge. It's conjectural, guesswork,,tested by observation,,not derived from it.,So, were testable conjectures,the great innovation that opened the intellectual prison gates?,No. Contrary to what's usually said,,testability is common,,in myths and all sorts of other irrational modes of thinking.,Any crank claiming the sun will go out next Tuesday,has got a testable prediction. 
 Consider the ancient Greek myth,explaining seasons.,Hades, God of the Underworld,,kidnaps Persephone, the Goddess of Spring,,and negotiates a forced marriage contract,,requiring her to return regularly, and lets her go.,And each year,,she is magically compelled to return.,And her mother, Demeter,,Goddess of the Earth,,is sad, and makes it cold and barren.,That myth is testable.,If winter is caused by Demeter's sadness,,then it must happen everywhere on Earth simultaneously.,So if the ancient Greeks had only known that Australia,is at its warmest when Demeter is at her saddest,,they'd have known that their theory is false. 
 So what was wrong with that myth,,and with all pre-scientific thinking,,and what, then, made that momentous difference?,I think there is one thing you have to care about.,And that implies,testability, the scientific method,,the Enlightenment, and everything.,And here is the crucial thing.,There is such a thing as a defect in a story.,I don't just mean a logical defect. I mean a bad explanation.,What does that mean? Well, explanation,is an assertion about what's there, unseen,,that accounts for what's seen. 
 Because the explanatory role,of Persephone's marriage contract,could be played equally well,by infinitely many other,ad hoc entities.,Why a marriage contract and not any other reason,for regular annual action?,Here is one. Persephone wasn't released.,She escaped, and returns every spring,to take revenge on Hades,,with her Spring powers.,She cools his domain with Spring air,,venting heat up to the surface, creating summer.,That accounts for the same phenomena as the original myth.,It's equally testable.,Yet what it asserts about reality,is, in many ways, the opposite.,And that is possible because,the details of the original myth,are unrelated to seasons,,except via the myth itself. 
 This easy variability,is the sign of a bad explanation,,because, without a functional reason to prefer,one of countless variants,,advocating one of them, in preference to the others,,is irrational.,So, for the essence of what,makes the difference to enable progress,,seek good explanations,,the ones that can't be easily varied,,while still explaining the phenomena. 
 Now, our current explanation of seasons,is that the Earth's axis is tilted like that,,so each hemisphere tilts toward the sun for half the year,,and away for the other half.,Better put that up.,(Laughter),That's a good explanation: hard to vary,,because every detail plays a functional role.,For instance, we know, independently of seasons,,that surfaces tilted away,from radiant heat are heated less,,and that a spinning sphere, in space,,points in a constant direction.,And the tilt also explains,the sun's angle of elevation at different times of year,,and predicts that the seasons,will be out of phase in the two hemispheres.,If they'd been observed in phase,,the theory would have been refuted.,But now, the fact that it's also a good explanation,,hard to vary, makes the crucial difference. 
 If the ancient Greeks had found out,about seasons in Australia,,they could have easily varied their myth,to predict that.,For instance, when Demeter is upset,,she banishes heat from her vicinity,,into the other hemisphere, where it makes summer.,So, being proved wrong by observation,,and changing their theory accordingly,,still wouldn't have got the ancient Greeks,one jot closer to understanding seasons,,because their explanation was bad: easy to vary.,And it's only when an explanation is good,that it even matters whether it's testable.,If the axis-tilt theory had been refuted,,its defenders would have had nowhere to go.,No easily implemented change,could make that tilt,cause the same seasons in both hemispheres. 
 The search for hard-to-vary explanations,is the origin of all progress.,It's the basic regulating principle,of the Enlightenment.,So, in science, two false approaches blight progress.,One is well known: untestable theories.,But the more important one is explanationless theories.,Whenever you're told that some existing statistical trend will continue,,but you aren't given a hard-to-vary account,of what causes that trend,,you're being told a wizard did it. 
 When you are told that carrots have human rights,because they share half our genes --,but not how gene percentages confer rights -- wizard.,When someone announces that the nature-nurture debate,has been settled because there is evidence,that a given percentage of our,political opinions are genetically inherited,,but they don't explain how genes cause opinions,,they've settled nothing. They are saying that our,opinions are caused by wizards,,and presumably so are their own.,That the truth consists of,hard to vary assertions about reality,is the most important fact,about the physical world.,It's a fact that is, itself, unseen,,yet impossible to vary. Thank you.,(Applause)I just want to say my name is Emmanuel Jal.,And I come from a long way.,I've been telling a story that has been so painful for me.,It's been a tough journey for me, traveling the world,,telling my story in form of a book.,And also telling it like now.,And also, the easiest one was,when I was doing it in form of a music. 
 So I have branded myself as a war child.,I'm doing this,because of an old lady in my village now,,who have lost her children.,There is no newspaper to cover her pain,,and what she wants to change in this society.,And I'm doing it for a young man,who want to create a change and has no way to project his voice,because he can't write.,Or there is no Internet, like Facebook, MySpace,,YouTube, for them to talk. 
 Also one thing that kept me pushing this story,,this painful stories out, the dreams I have,,sometimes, is like the voices of the dead,,that I have seen,would tell me, "Don't give up. Keep on going.",Because sometime I feel like stopping and not doing it,,because I didn't know what I was putting myself into. 
 Well I was born in the most difficult time,,when my country was at war.,I saw my village burned down.,The world that meant a lot to me, I saw it,vanish in my face.,I saw my aunt in rape when I was only five.,My mother was claimed by the war.,My brothers and sisters were scattered.,And up to now, me and my father,were detached and I still have issues with him.,Seeing people die every day,,my mother crying,,it's like I was raised in a violence.,And that made me call myself a war child. 
 And not only that, when I was eight,I became a child soldier. 
 I didn't know what was the war for.,But one thing I knew,was an image that I saw that stuck in my head.,When I went to the training camp I say,,"I want to kill as many Muslims,,and as many Arabs, as possible.",The training wasn't easy, but that was the driving force,,because I wanted to revenge for my family.,I wanted to revenge for my village. 
 Luckily now things have changed,because I came to discover the truth.,What was actually killing us wasn't the Muslims,,wasn't the Arabs.,It was somebody sitting somewhere manipulating the system,,and using religion to get what they want to get out of us,,which is the oil, the diamond,,the gold and the land.,So realizing the truth gave me a position to choose:,should I continue to hate, or let it go? 
 So I happened to forgive. Now I sing,music with the Muslims. I dance with them.,I even had a movie out called "War Child,",funded by Muslim people.,So that pain has gone out.,But my story is huge.,So I'm just going to go into a different step now,,which is easier for me.,I'm going to give you poem,called "Forced to Sin,",which is from my album "War Child.",I talk about my story.,One of the journey that I tread,when I was tempted to eat my friend because we had no food,and we were like around 400.,And only 16 people survived that journey.,So I hope you're going to hear this. 
 My dreams are like torment.,My every moment. 
 Voices in my brain, of friends that was slain. 
 Friends like Lual who died by my side, 
 of starvation.,In the burning jungle, and the desert plain. 
 Next was I, but Jesus heard my cry. 
 As I was tempted to eat the rotten flesh,of my comrade, 
 he gave me comfort. 
 We used to raid villages,,stealing chickens, goats and sheeps, 
 anything we could eat. 
 I knew it was rude, but we needed food. 
 And therefore I was forced to sin,,forced to sin to make a living, 
 forced to sin to make a living. 
 Sometimes you gotta lose to win. 
 Never give up. Never give in. 
 Left home at the age of seven. 
 One year later, live with an AK-47 by my side. 
 Slept with one eye open wide. 
 Run, duck, play dead and hide. 
 I've seen my people die like flies. 
 But I've never seen a dead body, 
 at least one that I've killed. 
 But still as I wonder, I won't go under. 
 Guns barking like lightning and thunder. 
 As a child so young and tender, 
 Words I can't forget I still remember. 
 I saw sergeant command raising his hand, 
 no retreat, no surrender. 
 I carry the banner of the trauma. 
 War child, child without a mama, 
 still fighting in the saga. 
 Yet as I wage this new war I'm not alone in this drama. 
 No sit or stop, as I reach for the top 
 I'm fully dedicated like a patriotic cop. 
 I'm on a fight, day and night. 
 Sometime I do wrong in order to make things right. 
 It's like I'm living a dream. 
 First time I'm feeling like a human being. 
 Ah! The children of Darfur. 
 Your empty bellies on the telly and now it's you,that I'm fighting for. 
 Left home.,Don't even know the day I'll ever return. 
 My country is war-torn. 
 Music I used to hear was bombs and fire of guns. 
 So many people die that I don't even cry no more. 
 Ask God question, what am I here for. 
 And why are my people poor. 
 And why, why when the rest of the children were learning how to read and write, 
 I was learning how to fight. 
 I ate snails, vultures, rabbits,,snakes, and anything that had life. 
 I was ready to eat. 
 I know it's a shame. But who is to be blamed? 
 That's my story shared in the form of a lesson. 
 (Applause),Thank you.,(Applause) 
 What energized me and kept me going is the music I do.,I never saw anybody,to tell my story to them,so they could advise me or do therapy.,So the music had been my therapy for me.,It's been where I actually see heaven,,where I can be happy,,where I can be a child again, in dances, through music.,So one thing I know about music:,music is the only thing that has power,to enter your cell system,,your mind, your heart,,influence your soul and your spirit,,and can even influence the way you live,without even you knowing.,Music is the only thing that can,make you want to wake up your bed,and shake your leg,,without even wanting to do it.,And so the power music has,I normally compare to the power love,when love doesn't see a color.,You know, if you fall in love with a frog, that's it. 
 One testimony about how I find music,is powerful is when,I was still a soldier back then.,I hated the people in the north.,But I don't know why I don't hate their music.,So we party and dance to their music.,And one thing that shocked me is one day,they brought an Arab musician,to come and entertain the soldiers.,And I almost broke my leg dancing to his music.,But I had this question.,So now I'm doing music so I know what the power of music is. 
 So what's happening here?,I've been in a painful journey.,Today is day number 233,in which I only eat dinner.,I don't eat breakfast. No lunch.,And I've done a campaign called,Lose to Win.,Where I'm losing so that I could win,the battle that I'm fighting now.,So my breakfast, my lunch,,I donate it to a charity that I founded,because we want to build a school in Sudan. 
 And I'm doing this because also,it's a normal thing in my home, people eat one meal a day.,Here I am in the West. I choose not to.,So in my village now, kids there,,they normally listen to BBC, or any radio,,and they are waiting to know,,the day Emmanuel will eat his breakfast,it means he got the money to build our school.,And so I made a commitment. I say,,"I'm gonna not eat my breakfast.",I thought I was famous enough that I would raise the money within one month,,but I've been humbled.,(Laughter) 
 So it's taken me 232 days.,And I said, "No stop until we get it.",And like it's been done on Facebook, MySpace.,The people are giving three dollars.,The lowest amount we ever got was 20 cents.,Somebody donated 20 cents online.,I don't know how they did it.,(Laughter),But that moved me. 
 And so, the importance of education to me,is what I'm willing to die for.,I'm willing to die for this,,because I know what it can do to my people.,Education enlighten your brain,,give you so many chances,,and you're able to survive.,As a nation we have been crippled.,For so many years we have fed on aid.,You see a 20-years-old, 30-years-old,families in a refugee camps.,They only get the food that drops from the sky, from the U.N. 
 So these people,,you're killing a whole generation if you just give them aid.,If anybody want to help us,this is what we need.,Give us tools. Give the farmers tools.,It's rain. Africa is fertile. They can grow the crops.,(Applause),Invest in education.,Education so that we have strong institution,that can create a revolution to change everything.,Because we have all those old men,that are creating wars in Africa. They will die soon.,But if you invest in education,then we'll be able to change Africa.,That's what I'm asking.,(Applause) 
 So in order to do that,,I founded a charter called Gua Africa,,where we put kids in school.,And now we have a couple in university.,We have like 40 kids, ex-child soldiers,mixed with anybody that we feel like we want to support.,And I said "I'm going to put it in practice.",And with the people that are going to follow me and help me do things.,That's what I want to do to change,,to make a difference in the world. 
 Well now, my time is going,,so I want to sing a song.,But I'll ask you guys to stand up,so we celebrate the life of a British aid worker,called Emma McCune,that made it possible for me to be here.,I'm gonna sing this song,,just to inspire you how this woman has made a difference.,She came to my country and saw the importance,of education. 
 She said the only way to help Sudan,is to invest in the women, educating them,,educating the children,,so that they could come and create a revolution,in this complex society.,So she even ended up marrying a commander,from the SPLA.,And she rescued over 150 child soldiers.,One of them happened to be me now.,And so at this moment I want to ask to celebrate Emma with me.,Are you guys ready to celebrate Emma? 
 Audience: Yes! 
 Emmanuel Jal: All right.

 (Applause),Thank you.,(Applause) 
 Go save a life of a child.,(Applause)Early visions of wireless power,actually were thought of by Nikola Tesla,basically about 100 years ago.,The thought that,you wouldn't want to transfer electric power wirelessly,,no one ever thought of that.,They thought, "Who would use it if you didn't?",And so, in fact, he actually set about,doing a variety of things.,Built the Tesla coil. This tower was built,on Long Island back at the beginning of the 1900s.,And the idea was, it was supposed to be able to transfer power,anywhere on Earth.,We'll never know if this stuff worked. Actually, I think the,Federal Bureau of Investigation,took it down for security purposes,,sometime in the early 1900s. 
 But the one thing that did come out of electricity,is that we love this stuff so much.,I mean, think about how much we love this.,If you just walk outside, there are trillions of dollars,that have been invested in infrastructure around the world,,putting up wires to get power from where it's created,to where it's used.,The other thing is, we love batteries.,And for those of us that have an environmental element to us,,there is something like 40 billion,disposable batteries built every year,for power that, generally speaking,,is used within a few inches or a few feet,of where there is very inexpensive power. 
 So, before I got here,,I thought, "You know, I am from North America.,We do have a little bit of a reputation in the United States.",So I thought I'd better look it up first.,So definition number six is the North American,definition of the word "suck.",Wires suck, they really do.,Think about it. Whether that's you in that picture,or something under your desk.,The other thing is, batteries suck too.,And they really, really do.,Do you ever wonder what happens to this stuff?,40 billion of these things built.,This is what happens.,They fall apart, they disintegrate,,and they end up here. 
 So when you talk about expensive power,,the cost per kilowatt-hour,to supply battery power to something,is on the order of two to three hundred pounds.,Think about that.,The most expensive grid power in the world,is thousandths of that.,So fortunately, one of the other definitions,of "suck" that was in there, it does create a vacuum.,And nature really does abhor a vacuum. 
 What happened back a few years ago,was a group of theoretical physicists at MIT,actually came up with this concept of transferring power over distance.,Basically they were able to light a 60 watt light bulb,at a distance of about two meters.,It got about 50 percent of the efficiency --,by the way, that's still a couple thousand times,more efficient than a battery would be, to do the same thing.,But were able to light that,,and do it very successfully.,This was actually the experiment. So you can see,the coils were somewhat larger.,The light bulb was a fairly simple task, from their standpoint. 
 This all came from a professor,waking up at night to the third night in a row,that his wife's cellphone was beeping,because it was running out of battery power.,And he was thinking, "With all the electricity that's out there in the walls,,why couldn't some of that just come into the phone so I could get some sleep?",And he actually came up with this concept,of resonant energy transfer.,But inside a standard transformer are two coils of wire.,And those two coils of wire are really, really close to each other,,and actually do transfer power,magnetically and wirelessly, only over a very short distance. 
 What Dr. Soljacic figured out how to do,was separate the coils in a transformer,to a greater distance than the size of those transformers,using this technology, which is not dissimilar,from the way an opera singer shatters a glass on the other side of the room.,It's a resonant phenomenon,for which he actually received a MacArthur Fellowship Award,,which is nicknamed the Genius Award,,last September, for his discovery. 
 So how does it work?,Imagine a coil. For those of you that are engineers,,there's a capacitor attached to it too.,And if you can cause that coil to resonate,,what will happen is it will pulse,at alternating current frequencies --,at a fairly high frequency, by the way.,And if you can bring another device,close enough to the source,,that will only work at exactly that frequency,,you can actually get them to do what's called strongly couple,,and transfer magnetic energy between them.,And then what you do is, you start out with electricity,,turn it into magnetic field, take that magnetic field,,turn it back into electricity,,and then you can use it. 
 Number one question I get asked.,I mean, people are worried about cellphones being safe.,You know. What about safety?,The first thing is this is not a "radiative" technology.,It doesn't radiate.,There aren't electric fields here. It's a magnetic field.,It stays within either what we call the source,,or within the device.,And actually, the magnetic fields we're using,are basically about the same as the Earth's magnetic field.,We live in a magnetic field. 
 And the other thing that's pretty cool about the technology is,that it only transfers energy to things that work at exactly the same frequency.,And it's virtually impossible in nature to make that happen.,Then finally we have governmental bodies everywhere,that will regulate everything we do.,They've pretty much set field exposure limits,,which all of the things in the stuff I'll show you today,sort of sit underneath those guidelines. 
 Mobile electronics.,Home electronics.,Those cords under your desk, I bet everybody here,has something that looks like that or those batteries.,There are industrial applications.,And then finally, electric vehicles.,These electric cars are beautiful.,But who is going to want to plug them in?,Imagine driving into your garage -- we've built a system to do this --,you drive into your garage, and the car charges itself,,because there is a mat on the floor that's plugged into the wall.,And it actually causes your car to charge safely and efficiently.,Then there's all kinds of other applications. Implanted medical devices,,where people don't have to die of infections anymore,if you can seal the thing up.,Credit cards, robot vacuum cleaners. 
 So what I'd like to do is take a couple minutes,and show you, actually, how it works.,And what I'm going to do is to show you pretty much what's here.,You've got a coil.,That coil is connected to an R.F. amplifier,that creates a high-frequency oscillating magnetic field.,We put one on the back of the television set.,By the way, I do make it look a little bit easier than it is.,There's lots of electronics and secret sauce,and all kinds of intellectual property that go into it.,But then what's going to happen is, it will create a field.,It will cause one to get created,on the other side. 
 And if the demo gods are willing,,in about 10 seconds or so we should see it.,The 10 seconds actually are because we --,I don't know if any of you have ever thought about plugging a T.V. in,when you use just a cord.,Generally, you have to go over and hit the button. So I thought,we put a little computer in it that has to wake up,to tell it to do that.,So, I'll plug that in.,It creates a magnetic field here.,It causes one to be created out here.,And as I said, in sort of about 10 seconds,we should start to see ... 
 This is a commercially --,(Applause),available color television set.,Imagine, you get one of these things. You want to hang them on the wall.,How many people want to hang them on the wall?,Think about it. You don't want those ugly cords coming down.,Imagine if you can get rid of it. 
 The other thing I wanted to talk about was safety.,So, there is nothing going on. I'm okay.,And I'll do it again, just for safety's sake.,Almost immediately, though, people ask,,"How small can you make this? Can you make this small enough?",Because remember Dr. Soljacic's original idea,was his wife's cellphone beeping. 
 So, I wanted to show you something.,We're an equal opportunity designer of this sort of thing.,This a Google G1.,You know, it's the latest thing that's come out.,It runs the Android operating system.,I think I heard somebody talk about that before.,It's odd. It has a battery.,It also has coiled electronics,that WiTricity has put into the back of it.,And if I can get the camera --,okay, great --,you'll see, as I get sort of close...,you're looking at a cellphone powered completely wirelessly.,(Applause) 
 And I know some of you are Apple aficionados.,So, you know they don't make it easy at Apple to get inside their phones.,So we put a little sleeve on the back,,but we should be able to get this guy to wake up too.,And those of you that have an iPhone recognize the green center.,(Applause) 
 And Nokia as well.,You'll see that what we did there is put a little thing in the back, to do that,,and it probably beeps, actually, as it goes on as well.,But they typically use it to light up the screen.,So, imagine these things could go ... they could go in your ceiling.,They could go in the floor. They could go, actually, underneath your desktop.,So that when you walk in or you come in from home,,if you carry a purse, it works in your purse.,You never have to worry about plugging these things in again.,And think of what that would do for you. 
 So I think in closing,,sort of in the immortal visions of The New Yorker magazine,,I thought I'd put up one more slide.,And for those of you who can't read it, it says,,"It does appear to be some kind of wireless technology.",So, thank you very much.,(Applause)I'm a creative technologist,and the focus of my work is on public installations.,One of my driving passions,is this idea of exploring nature,,and trying to find hidden data within nature.,It seems to me that there is,this latent potential everywhere, all around us.,Everything gives out some kind of data,,whether it's sound or smell or vibration.,Through my work, I've been,trying to find ways to harness and unveil this.,And so this basically led me to,a subject called cymatics.,Now, cymatics is the process of visualizing sound,by basically vibrating a medium such as sand or water,,as you can see there. 
 So, if we have a quick look at the history of cymatics,beginning with the observations of resonance,,by Da Vinci, Galileo, the English scientist Robert Hook,and then Ernest Chladni.,He created an experiment using a metal plate,,covering it with sand and then bowing it,to create the Chladni patterns that you see here on the right. 
 Moving on from this, the next person to explore this field,was a gentleman called Hans Jenny in the 1970s.,He actually coined the term cymatics.,Then bringing us into the present day,is a fellow collaborator of mine,and cymatics expert, John Stewart Reed.,He's kindly recreated for us,the Chladni experiment.,What we can see here is,the metal sheet, this time connected to a sound driver,and being fed by a frequency generator.,As the frequencies increase,,so do the complexities of the patterns that appear on the plate.,As you can see with your own eyes.,(Applause) 
 So, what excites me about cymatics?,Well, for me cymatics is an almost magical tool.,It's like a looking glass into a hidden world.,Through the numerous ways that we can apply cymatics,,we can actually start to unveil the substance of things not seen.,Devices like the cymascope, which you can see here,,have been used to scientifically observe cymatic patterns.,And the list of scientific applications is growing every day. 
 For example, in oceanography,,a lexicon of dolphin language is actually being created,by basically visualizing the sonar beams that the dolphins emit.,And hopefully in the future we'll be able to gain some deeper understanding,of how they communicate.,We can also use cymatics for healing and education.,This is an installation developed with school children,,where their hands are tracked. It allows them,to control and position cymatic patterns,and the reflections that are caused by them.,We can also use cymatics as a beautiful natural art form. 
 This image here is created from a snippet,of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony playing through a cymatic device.,So it kind of flips things on its head a little bit.,This is Pink Floyd's "Machine",playing in real time through the cymascope.,We can also use cymatics as a looking glass into nature.,And we can actually recreate the archetypal forms of nature.,So, for example, here on the left we can see a snowflake as it would appear in nature.,Then on the right we can see a cymatically created snowflake.,And here is a starfish and a cymatic starfish.,And there is thousands of these. 
 So what does this all mean?,Well, there is still a lot to explore,in its early days. And there's not many people working in this field.,But consider for a moment that sound does have form.,We've seen that it can affect matter and cause form within matter.,Then sort of take a leap and think about the universe forming.,And think about the immense sound of the universe forming.,And if we kind of ponder on that, then perhaps,cymatics had an influence on the formation of the universe itself. 
 And here is some eye candy for you, from a range of,DIY scientists and artists,from all over the globe.,Cymatics is accessible to everybody.,I want to urge everybody here to,apply your passion, your knowledge,and your skills to areas like cymatics.,I think collectively we can build a global community.,We can inspire each other.,And we can evolve this exploration,of the substance of things not seen. Thank you.,(Applause)Good morning. I think, as a grumpy Eastern European,,I was brought in to play the pessimist this morning. So bear with me.,Well, I come from the former Soviet Republic of Belarus,,which, as some of you may know,,is not exactly an oasis of liberal democracy.,So that's why I've always been fascinated,with how technology could actually reshape,and open up authoritarian societies like ours. 
 So, I'm graduating college,and, feeling very idealistic,,I decided to join the NGO,which actually was using new media,to promote democracy and media reform,in much of the former Soviet Union.,However, to my surprise,,I discovered that dictatorships,do not crumble so easily.,In fact, some of them actually,survived the Internet challenge,,and some got even more repressive. 
 So this is when I ran out of my idealism and,decided to quit my NGO job,and actually study how the Internet could impede democratization.,Now, I must tell you that this was never,a very popular argument,,and it's probably not very popular yet,with some of you sitting in this audience.,It was never popular with many political leaders,,especially those in the United States,who somehow thought that new media,would be able to do what missiles couldn't.,That is, promote democracy in difficult places,where everything else has already been tried and failed.,And I think by 2009,,this news has finally reached Britain,,so I should probably add Gordon Brown to this list as well. 
 However, there is an underlying argument about logistics,,which has driven so much of this debate. Right?,So if you look at it close enough,,you'll actually see that much of this,is about economics.,The cybertopians say, much like fax machines,and Xerox machines did in the '80s,,blogs and social networks,have radically transformed the economics of protest,,so people would inevitably rebel.,To put it very simply,,the assumption so far has been,that if you give people enough connectivity,,if you give them enough devices,,democracy will inevitably follow. 
 And to tell you the truth,,I never really bought into this argument,,in part because I never saw three American presidents,agree on anything else in the past.,(Laughter),But, you know, even beyond that,,if you think about the logic underlying it,,is something I call iPod liberalism,,where we assume that every single Iranian or Chinese,who happens to have and love his iPod,will also love liberal democracy.,And again, I think this is kind of false. 
 But I think a much bigger problem with this,is that this logic --,that we should be dropping iPods not bombs --,I mean, it would make a fascinating title,for Thomas Friedman's new book.,(Laughter),But this is rarely a good sign. Right?,So, the bigger problem with this logic,is that it confuses the intended,versus the actual uses of technology.,For those of you who think that,new media of the Internet,could somehow help us avert genocide,,should look no further than Rwanda,,where in the '90s it was actually two radio stations,which were responsible for fueling much of the ethnic hatred in the first place. 
 But even beyond that, coming back to the Internet,,what you can actually see,is that certain governments,have mastered the use of cyberspace,for propaganda purposes. Right?,And they are building what I call the Spinternet.,The combination of spin, on the one hand,,and the Internet on the other.,So governments from Russia to China to Iran,are actually hiring, training and paying bloggers,in order to leave ideological comments,and create a lot of ideological blog posts,to comment on sensitive political issues. Right? 
 So you may wonder, why on Earth are they doing it?,Why are they engaging with cyberspace?,Well my theory is that,it's happening because censorship actually,is less effective than you think it is in many of those places.,The moment you put something critical in a blog,,even if you manage to ban it immediately,,it will still spread around thousands and thousands of other blogs.,So the more you block it,,the more it emboldens people to actually avoid the censorship,and thus win in this cat-and-mouse game.,So the only way to control this message,is actually to try to spin it,and accuse anyone who has written something critical,of being, for example, a CIA agent. 
 And, again, this is happening quite often.,Just to give you an example of how it works in China, for example.,There was a big case in February 2009,called "Elude the Cat.",And for those of you who didn't know, I'll just give a little summary.,So what happened is that a 24-year-old man,,a Chinese man, died in prison custody.,And police said that it happened,because he was playing hide and seek,,which is "elude the cat" in Chinese slang,,with other inmates and hit his head,against the wall,,which was not an explanation which sat well with many Chinese bloggers. 
 So they immediately began posting a lot of critical comments.,In fact, QQ.com, which is a popular Chinese website,,had 35,000 comments,on this issue within hours.,But then authorities did something very smart.,Instead of trying to purge these comments,,they instead went and reached out to the bloggers.,And they basically said, "Look guys. We'd like you to become netizen investigators.",So 500 people applied,,and four were selected to actually go and tour the facility in question,,and thus inspect it and then blog about it.,Within days the entire incident was forgotten,,which would have never happened if they simply tried to block the content.,People would keep talking about it for weeks. 
 And this actually fits with another interesting theory,about what's happening in authoritarian states,and in their cyberspace.,This is what political scientists call authoritarian deliberation,,and it happens when governments are actually reaching out to their critics,and letting them engage with each other online.,We tend to think,that somehow this is going to harm these dictatorships,,but in many cases it only strengthens them.,And you may wonder why.,I'll just give you a very short list of reasons,why authoritarian deliberation,may actually help the dictators. 
 And first it's quite simple.,Most of them operate in a complete information vacuum.,They don't really have the data they need,in order to identify emerging threats facing the regime.,So encouraging people to actually go online,and share information and data,on blogs and wikis is great,because otherwise, low level apparatchiks and bureaucrats,will continue concealing what's actually happening in the country, right?,So from this perspective, having blogs and wikis,produce knowledge has been great. 
 Secondly, involving public in any decision making,is also great,because it helps you to share the blame,for the policies which eventually fail.,Because they say, "Well look, we asked you,,we consulted you, you voted on it.,You put it on the front page of your blog.,Well, great. You are the one who is to blame." 
 And finally, the purpose of,any authoritarian deliberation efforts,is usually to increase the legitimacy of the regimes, both at home and abroad.,So inviting people to all sorts of public forums,,having them participate in decision making,,it's actually great.,Because what happens is that then,you can actually point to this initiative and say,,"Well, we are having a democracy. We are having a forum." 
 Just to give you an example,,one of the Russian regions, for example,,now involves its citizens,in planning its strategy up until year 2020.,Right? So they can go online,and contribute ideas on what that region would look like by the year 2020.,I mean, anyone who has been to Russia would know,that there was no planning in Russia for the next month.,So having people involved in planning for 2020,is not necessarily going to change anything,,because the dictators are still the ones who control the agenda. 
 Just to give you an example from Iran,,we all heard about the Twitter revolution,that happened there,,but if you look close enough, you'll actually see,that many of the networks and blogs,and Twitter and Facebook were actually operational.,They may have become slower,,but the activists could still access it,and actually argue that having access to them,is actually great for many authoritarian states.,And it's great simply because,they can gather open source intelligence. 
 In the past it would take you weeks, if not months,,to identify how Iranian activists connect to each other.,Now you actually know how they connect to each other,by looking at their Facebook page.,I mean KGB, and not just KGB,,used to torture in order to actually get this data.,Now it's all available online.,(Laughter) 
 But I think the biggest conceptual pitfall,that cybertopians made,is when it comes to digital natives, people who have grown up online.,We often hear about cyber activism,,how people are getting more active because of the Internet.,Rarely hear about cyber hedonism, for example,,how people are becoming passive.,Why? Because they somehow assume that the Internet,is going to be the catalyst of change,that will push young people into the streets,,while in fact it may actually be the new opium for the masses,which will keep the same people in their rooms downloading pornography.,That's not an option being considered too strongly. 
 So for every digital renegade that is revolting in the streets of Tehran,,there may as well be two digital captives,who are actually rebelling only in the World of Warcraft.,And this is realistic. And there is nothing wrong about it,because the Internet has greatly empowered many of these young people,and it plays a completely different social role for them. 
 If you look at some of the surveys,on how the young people actually benefit from the Internet,,you'll see that the number of teenagers in China, for example,,for whom the Internet actually broadens their sex life,,is three times more than in the United States.,So it does play a social role,,however it may not necessarily lead to political engagement. 
 So the way I tend to think of it,is like a hierarchy of cyber-needs in space,,a total rip-off from Abraham Maslow.,But the point here is that,when we get the remote Russian village online,,what will get people to the Internet,is not going to be the reports from Human Rights Watch.,It's going to be pornography, "Sex and the City,",or maybe watching funny videos of cats.,So this is something you have to recognize. 
 So what should we do about it?,Well I say we have to stop thinking,about the number of iPods per capita,and start thinking about ways in which,we can empower intellectuals,,dissidents, NGOs and then the members of civil society.,Because even what has been happening up 'til now,with the Spinternet and authoritarian deliberation,,there is a great chance that those voices will not be heard.,So I think we should shatter some of our utopian assumptions,and actually start doing something about it.,Thank you.,(Applause)I have a very difficult task.,I'm a spectroscopist.,I have to talk about astronomy without showing you,any single image of nebulae or galaxies, etc.,because my job is spectroscopy.,I never deal with images.,But I'll try to convince you,that spectroscopy is actually something which can,change this world.,Spectroscopy can probably answer the question,,"Is there anybody out there?",Are we alone? SETI.,It's not very fun to do spectroscopy. 
 One of my colleagues in Bulgaria,,Nevena Markova, spent about 20 years,studying these profiles.,And she published 42 articles,just dedicated to the subject.,Can you imagine? Day and night, thinking,,observing, the same star for 20 years,is incredible.,But we are crazy. We do these things.,(Laughter) 
 And I'm not that far.,I spent about eight months working on these profiles.,Because I've noticed,a very small symmetry,in the profile of one of the planet host stars.,And I thought, well maybe there is Lithium-6 in this star,,which is an indication that this star,has swallowed a planet.,Because apparently you can't have this fragile isotope,of Lithium-6 in the atmospheres of sun-like stars.,But you have it in planets and asteroids.,So if you engulf planet or large number of asteroids,,you will have this Lithium-6 isotope,in the spectrum of the star.,So I invested more than eight months,just studying the profile of this star. 
 And actually it's amazing,,because I got phone calls from many reporters asking,,"Have you actually seen the planet going into a star?",Because they thought that if you are having a telescope,,you are an astronomer so what you are doing,is actually looking in a telescope.,And you might have seen the planet going into a star.,And I was saying, "No, excuse me.,What I see is this one.",(Laughter),It's just incredible. Because nobody understood really.,I bet that there were very few people,who really understood what I'm talking about.,Because this is the indication that the planet went into the star.,It's amazing. 
 The power of spectroscopy,was actually realized,by Pink Floyd already in 1973.,(Laughter),Because they actually said that,you can get any color you like,in a spectrum.,And all you need is time and money,to make your spectrograph.,This is the number one high resolution,,most precise spectrograph on this planet, called HARPS,,which is actually used to detect,extrasolar planets and sound waves,in the atmospheres of stars. 
 How we get spectra?,I'm sure most of you know from school physics,that it's basically splitting a white light,into colors.,And if you have a liquid hot mass,,it will produce something which we call a continuous spectrum.,A hot gas is producing emission lines only,,no continuum.,And if you place a cool gas in front of a,hot source,,you will see certain patterns,which we call absorption lines.,Which is used actually to identify chemical elements,in a cool matter,,which is absorbing exactly at those frequencies. 
 Now, what we can do with the spectra?,We can actually study line-of-sight velocities,of cosmic objects.,And we can also study chemical composition,and physical parameters of stars,,galaxies, nebulae.,A star is the most simple object.,In the core, we have thermonuclear reactions going on,,creating chemical elements.,And we have a cool atmosphere.,It's cool for me.,Cool in my terms is three or four or five thousand degrees.,My colleagues in infra-red astronomy,call minus 200 Kelvin is cool for them.,But you know, everything is relative.,So for me 5,000 degrees is pretty cool.,(Laughter) 
 This is the spectrum of the Sun --,24,000 spectral lines,,and about 15 percent of these lines is not yet identified.,It is amazing. So we are in the 21st century,,and we still cannot properly understand,the spectrum of the sun.,Sometimes we have to deal with,just one tiny, weak spectral line,to measure the composition of that chemical element in the atmosphere.,For instance, you see the spectral line of the gold,is the only spectral line in the spectrum of the Sun.,And we use this weak feature,to measure the composition,of gold in the atmosphere of the Sun. 
 And now this is a work in progress.,We have been dealing with a similarly very weak feature,,which belongs to osmium.,It's a heavy element produced in thermonuclear,explosions of supernovae.,It's the only place where you can produce, actually, osmium.,Just comparing the composition of osmium,in one of the planet host stars,,we want to understand why there is so much,of this element.,Perhaps we even think that maybe,supernova explosions trigger formations of planets and stars.,It can be an indication. 
 The other day, my colleague from Berkeley,,Gibor Basri, emailed me,a very interesting spectrum,,asking me, "Can you have a look at this?",And I couldn't sleep, next two weeks,,when I saw the huge amount of oxygen,and other elements in the spectrum of the stars.,I knew that there is nothing like that observed in the galaxy.,It was incredible. The only conclusion we could make from this,is clear evidence that there was a supernova explosion,in this system, which polluted the atmosphere,of this star.,And later a black hole was formed,in a binary system,,which is still there with a mass of about,five solar masses.,This was considered as first evidence that actually black holes,come from supernovae explosions. 
 My colleagues, comparing composition of chemical elements,in different galactic stars,,actually discovered alien stars in our galaxy.,It's amazing that you can go so far,simply studying the chemical composition of stars.,They actually said that one of the stars you see in the spectra,is an alien. It comes from a different galaxy.,There is interaction of galaxies. We know this.,And sometimes they just capture stars. 
 You've heard about solar flares.,We were very surprised to discover,a super flare,,a flare which is thousands of millions of times,more powerful than those we see in the Sun.,In one of the binary stars in our galaxy,called FH Leo,,we discovered the super flare.,And later we went to study the spectral stars,to see is there anything strange with these objects.,And we found that everything is normal.,These stars are normal like the Sun. Age, everything was normal.,So this is a mystery.,It's one of the mysteries we still have, super flares.,And there are six or seven similar cases,reported in the literature. 
 Now to go ahead with this,,we really need to understand chemical evolution of the universe.,It's very complicated. I don't really want you to,try to understand what is here.,(Laughter),But it's to show you how complicated is the whole story,of the production of chemical elements.,You have two channels --,the massive stars and low-mass stars --,producing and recycling matter and chemical elements in the universe.,And doing this for 14 billion years,,we end up with this picture,,which is a very important graph,,showing relative abundances of chemical elements,in sun-like stars,and in the interstellar medium. 
 So which means that it's really impossible,to find an object where you find about 10 times more sulfur than silicon,,five times more calcium than oxygen. It's just impossible.,And if you find one, I will say that,this is something related to SETI,,because naturally you can't do it.,Doppler Effect is something very important,from fundamental physics.,And this is related to the change of the frequency,of a moving source.,The Doppler Effect is used to discover extrasolar planets. 
 The precision which we need,to discover a Jupiter-like planet,around a sun-like star,is something like 28.4 meters per second.,And we need nine centimeters per second,to detect an Earth-like planet.,This can be done with the future spectrographs.,I, myself, I'm actually involved in the team,which is developing a CODEX,,high resolution, future generation spectrograph,for the 42 meter E-ELT telescope.,And this is going to be an instrument,to detect Earth-like planets,around sun-like stars.,It is an amazing tool called astroseismology,where we can detect sound waves,in the atmospheres of stars. 
 This is the sound of an Alpha Cen.,We can detect sound waves,in the atmospheres of sun-like stars.,Those waves have frequencies,in infrasound domain, the sound actually nobody knows, domain.,Coming back to the most important question,,"Is there anybody out there?",This is closely related,to tectonic and volcanic activity of planets.,Connection between life,and radioactive nuclei,is straightforward.,No life without tectonic activity,,without volcanic activity.,And we know very well that geothermal energy,is mostly produced by decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium. 
 How to measure, if we have planets,where the amount of those elements is small,,so those planets are tectonically dead,,there cannot be life.,If there is too much uranium or potassium or thorium,,probably, again, there would be no life.,Because can you imagine everything boiling?,It's too much energy on a planet.,Now, we have been measuring abundance,of thorium in one of the stars with extrasolar planets.,It's exactly the same game. A very tiny feature. 
 We are actually trying to measure this profile,and to detect thorium.,It's very tough. It's very tough.,And you have to, first you have to convince yourself.,Then you have to convince your colleagues.,And then you have to convince the whole world,that you have actually detected something like this,in the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet,host star somewhere in 100 parsec away from here.,It's really difficult.,But if you want to know about a life on extrasolar planets,,you have to do this job.,Because you have to know how much of radioactive element you have,in those systems. 
 The one way to discover about aliens,is to tune your radio telescope and listen to the signals.,If you receive something interesting,,well that's what SETI does actually,,what SETI has been doing for many years.,I think the most promising way,is to go for biomarkers.,You can see the spectrum of the Earth, this Earthshine spectrum,,and that is a very clear signal.,The slope which is coming, which we call a Red Edge,,is a detection of vegetated area.,It's amazing that we can detect vegetation,from a spectrum.,Now imagine doing this test,for other planets. 
 Now very recently, very recently,,I'm talking about last six, seven, eight months,,water, methane, carbon dioxide,have been detected in the spectrum,of a planet outside the solar system.,It's amazing. So this is the power of spectroscopy.,You can actually go and detect,and study a chemical composition of planets,far, far, far from solar system.,We have to detect oxygen or ozone,to make sure that we have all necessary conditions,to have life. 
 Cosmic miracles are something,which can be related to SETI.,Now imagine an object, amazing object,,or something which we cannot explain,when we just stand up and say,,"Look, we give up. Physics doesn't work.",So it's something which you can always refer to SETI and say,,"Well, somebody must be doing this, somehow." 
 And with the known physics etc,,it's something actually which has been pointed out,by Frank Drake,,many years ago, and Shklovsky.,If you see, in the spectrum of a planet host star,,if you see strange chemical elements,,it can be a signal from a civilization,which is there and they want to signal about it.,They want to actually signal their presence,through these spectral lines,,in the spectrum of a star, in different ways. 
 There can be different ways doing this.,One is, for instance, technetium,is a radioactive element,with a decay time of 4.2 million years.,If you suddenly observe technetium,in a sun-like star,,you can be sure that somebody has put this,element in the atmosphere,,because in a natural way it is impossible to do this.,Now we are reviewing the spectra of about,300 stars with extrasolar planets.,And we are doing this job since 2000,and it's a very heavy project.,We have been working very hard.,And we have some interesting cases,,candidates, so on, things which we can't really explain.,And I hope in the near future,we can confirm this. 
 So the main question: "Are we alone?",I think it will not come from UFOs.,It will not come from radio signals.,I think it will come from a spectrum like this.,It is the spectrum of a planet like Earth,,showing a presence of nitrogen dioxide,,as a clear signal of life,,and oxygen and ozone.,If, one day, and I think it will be,within 15 years from now, or 20 years.,If we discover a spectrum like this,we can be sure that there is life on that planet.,In about five years we will discover,planets like Earth, around sun-like stars,,the same distance as the Earth from the Sun.,It will take about five years.,And then we will need another 10, 15 years,with space projects,to get the spectra of Earth-like planets like the one I showed you.,And if we see the nitrogen dioxide,and oxygen,,I think we have the perfect E.T.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)Our mission is to build,a detailed, realistic,computer model of the human brain.,And we've done, in the past four years,,a proof of concept,on a small part of the rodent brain,,and with this proof of concept we are now scaling the project up,to reach the human brain. 
 Why are we doing this?,There are three important reasons.,The first is, it's essential for us to understand the human brain,if we do want to get along in society,,and I think that it is a key step in evolution.,The second reason is,,we cannot keep doing animal experimentation forever,,and we have to embody all our data and all our knowledge,into a working model.,It's like a Noah's Ark. It's like an archive.,And the third reason is that there are two billion people on the planet,that are affected by mental disorder,,and the drugs that are used today,are largely empirical.,I think that we can come up with very concrete solutions on,how to treat disorders. 
 Now, even at this stage,,we can use the brain model,to explore some fundamental questions,about how the brain works.,And here, at TED, for the first time,,I'd like to share with you how we're addressing,one theory -- there are many theories --,one theory of how the brain works.,So, this theory is that the brain,creates, builds, a version of the universe,,and projects this version of the universe,,like a bubble, all around us. 
 Now, this is of course a topic of philosophical debate for centuries.,But, for the first time, we can actually address this,,with brain simulation,,and ask very systematic and rigorous questions,,whether this theory could possibly be true.,The reason why the moon is huge on the horizon,is simply because our perceptual bubble,does not stretch out 380,000 kilometers.,It runs out of space.,And so what we do is we compare the buildings,within our perceptual bubble,,and we make a decision.,We make a decision it's that big,,even though it's not that big. 
 And what that illustrates,is that decisions are the key things,that support our perceptual bubble. It keeps it alive.,Without decisions you cannot see, you cannot think,,you cannot feel.,And you may think that anesthetics work,by sending you into some deep sleep,,or by blocking your receptors so that you don't feel pain,,but in fact most anesthetics don't work that way.,What they do is they introduce a noise,into the brain so that the neurons cannot understand each other.,They are confused,,and you cannot make a decision.,So, while you're trying to make up your mind,what the doctor, the surgeon, is doing,while he's hacking away at your body, he's long gone.,He's at home having tea.,(Laughter) 
 So, when you walk up to a door and you open it,,what you compulsively have to do to perceive,is to make decisions,,thousands of decisions about the size of the room,,the walls, the height, the objects in this room.,99 percent of what you see,is not what comes in through the eyes.,It is what you infer about that room.,So I can say, with some certainty,,"I think, therefore I am.",But I cannot say, "You think, therefore you are,",because "you" are within my perceptual bubble. 
 Now, we can speculate and philosophize this,,but we don't actually have to for the next hundred years.,We can ask a very concrete question.,"Can the brain build such a perception?",Is it capable of doing it?,Does it have the substance to do it?,And that's what I'm going to describe to you today. 
 So, it took the universe 11 billion years to build the brain.,It had to improve it a little bit.,It had to add to the frontal part, so that you would have instincts,,because they had to cope on land.,But the real big step was the neocortex.,It's a new brain. You needed it.,The mammals needed it,because they had to cope with parenthood,,social interactions,,complex cognitive functions. 
 So, you can think of the neocortex,actually as the ultimate solution today,,of the universe as we know it.,It's the pinnacle, it's the final product,that the universe has produced.,It was so successful in evolution,that from mouse to man it expanded,about a thousandfold in terms of the numbers of neurons,,to produce this almost frightening,organ, structure.,And it has not stopped its evolutionary path.,In fact, the neocortex in the human brain,is evolving at an enormous speed. 
 If you zoom into the surface of the neocortex,,you discover that it's made up of little modules,,G5 processors, like in a computer.,But there are about a million of them.,They were so successful in evolution,that what we did was to duplicate them,over and over and add more and more of them to the brain,until we ran out of space in the skull.,And the brain started to fold in on itself,,and that's why the neocortex is so highly convoluted.,We're just packing in columns,,so that we'd have more neocortical columns,to perform more complex functions. 
 So you can think of the neocortex actually as,a massive grand piano,,a million-key grand piano.,Each of these neocortical columns,would produce a note.,You stimulate it; it produces a symphony.,But it's not just a symphony of perception.,It's a symphony of your universe, your reality.,Now, of course it takes years to learn how,to master a grand piano with a million keys.,That's why you have to send your kids to good schools,,hopefully eventually to Oxford.,But it's not only education.,It's also genetics.,You may be born lucky,,where you know how to master your neocortical column,,and you can play a fantastic symphony. 
 In fact, there is a new theory of autism,called the "intense world" theory,,which suggests that the neocortical columns are super-columns.,They are highly reactive, and they are super-plastic,,and so the autists are probably capable of,building and learning a symphony,which is unthinkable for us.,But you can also understand,that if you have a disease,within one of these columns,,the note is going to be off.,The perception, the symphony that you create,is going to be corrupted,,and you will have symptoms of disease. 
 So, the Holy Grail for neuroscience,is really to understand the design of the neocoritical column --,and it's not just for neuroscience;,it's perhaps to understand perception, to understand reality,,and perhaps to even also understand physical reality.,So, what we did was, for the past 15 years,,was to dissect out the neocortex, systematically.,It's a bit like going and cataloging a piece of the rainforest.,How many trees does it have?,What shapes are the trees?,How many of each type of tree do you have? Where are they positioned? 
 But it's a bit more than cataloging because you actually have to,describe and discover all the rules of communication,,the rules of connectivity,,because the neurons don't just like to connect with any neuron.,They choose very carefully who they connect with.,It's also more than cataloging,because you actually have to build three-dimensional,digital models of them.,And we did that for tens of thousands of neurons,,built digital models of all the different types,of neurons we came across.,And once you have that, you can actually,begin to build the neocortical column. 
 And here we're coiling them up.,But as you do this, what you see,is that the branches intersect,actually in millions of locations,,and at each of these intersections,they can form a synapse.,And a synapse is a chemical location,where they communicate with each other.,And these synapses together,form the network,or the circuit of the brain.,Now, the circuit, you could also think of as,the fabric of the brain.,And when you think of the fabric of the brain,,the structure, how is it built? What is the pattern of the carpet?,You realize that this poses,a fundamental challenge to any theory of the brain,,and especially to a theory that says,that there is some reality that emerges,out of this carpet, out of this particular carpet,with a particular pattern. 
 The reason is because the most important design secret of the brain,is diversity.,Every neuron is different.,It's the same in the forest. Every pine tree is different.,You may have many different types of trees,,but every pine tree is different. And in the brain it's the same.,So there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as another,,and there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as in yours.,And your neurons are not going to be oriented and positioned,in exactly the same way.,And you may have more or less neurons.,So it's very unlikely,that you got the same fabric, the same circuitry. 
 So, how could we possibly create a reality,that we can even understand each other?,Well, we don't have to speculate.,We can look at all 10 million synapses now.,We can look at the fabric. And we can change neurons.,We can use different neurons with different variations.,We can position them in different places,,orient them in different places.,We can use less or more of them.,And when we do that,what we discovered is that the circuitry does change.,But the pattern of how the circuitry is designed does not.,So, the fabric of the brain,,even though your brain may be smaller, bigger,,it may have different types of neurons,,different morphologies of neurons,,we actually do share,the same fabric.,And we think this is species-specific,,which means that that could explain,why we can't communicate across species. 
 So, let's switch it on. But to do it, what you have to do,is you have to make this come alive.,We make it come alive,with equations, a lot of mathematics.,And, in fact, the equations that make neurons into electrical generators,were discovered by two Cambridge Nobel Laureates.,So, we have the mathematics to make neurons come alive.,We also have the mathematics to describe,how neurons collect information,,and how they create a little lightning bolt,to communicate with each other.,And when they get to the synapse,,what they do is they effectively,,literally, shock the synapse.,It's like electrical shock,that releases the chemicals from these synapses. 
 And we've got the mathematics to describe this process.,So we can describe the communication between the neurons.,There literally are only a handful,of equations that you need to simulate,the activity of the neocortex.,But what you do need is a very big computer.,And in fact you need one laptop,to do all the calculations just for one neuron.,So you need 10,000 laptops.,So where do you go? You go to IBM,,and you get a supercomputer, because they know how to take,10,000 laptops and put it into the size of a refrigerator.,So now we have this Blue Gene supercomputer.,We can load up all the neurons,,each one on to its processor,,and fire it up, and see what happens.,Take the magic carpet for a ride. 
 Here we activate it. And this gives the first glimpse,of what is happening in your brain,when there is a stimulation.,It's the first view.,Now, when you look at that the first time, you think,,"My god. How is reality coming out of that?",But, in fact, you can start,,even though we haven't trained this neocortical column,to create a specific reality.,But we can ask, "Where is the rose?",We can ask, "Where is it inside,,if we stimulate it with a picture?",Where is it inside the neocortex?,Ultimately it's got to be there if we stimulated it with it. 
 So, the way that we can look at that,is to ignore the neurons, ignore the synapses,,and look just at the raw electrical activity.,Because that is what it's creating.,It's creating electrical patterns.,So when we did this,,we indeed, for the first time,,saw these ghost-like structures:,electrical objects appearing,within the neocortical column.,And it's these electrical objects,that are holding all the information about,whatever stimulated it.,And then when we zoomed into this,,it's like a veritable universe. 
 So the next step,is just to take these brain coordinates,and to project them into perceptual space.,And if you do that,,you will be able to step inside,the reality that is created,by this machine,,by this piece of the brain.,So, in summary,,I think that the universe may have --,it's possible --,evolved a brain to see itself,,which may be a first step in becoming aware of itself.,There is a lot more to do to test these theories,,and to test any other theories.,But I hope that you are at least partly convinced,that it is not impossible to build a brain.,We can do it within 10 years,,and if we do succeed,,we will send to TED, in 10 years,,a hologram to talk to you. Thank you.,(Applause)The future, as we know it, is very unpredictable.,The best minds in the best institutions,generally get it wrong.,This is in technology. This is in the area of politics,,where pundits, the CIA, MI6 always get it wrong.,And it's clearly in the area of finance.,With institutions established to think about the future,,the IMF, the BIS, the Financial Stability Forum, couldn't see what was coming.,Over 20,000 economists,whose job it is, competitive entry to get there,,couldn't see what was happening. 
 Globalization is getting more complex.,And this change is getting more rapid.,The future will be more unpredictable.,Urbanization, integration,,coming together, leads to a new renaissance.,It did this a thousand years ago.,The last 40 years have been extraordinary times.,Life expectancy has gone up by about 25 years.,It took from the Stone Age to achieve that.,Income has gone up for a majority of the world's population,,despite the population going up by about two billion people over this period.,And illiteracy has gone down, from a half to about a quarter of the people on Earth.,A huge opportunity, unleashing of new potential,for innovation, for development. 
 But there is an underbelly.,There are two Achilles' heels of globalization.,There is the Achilles' heel of growing inequality --,those that are left out, those that feel angry,,those that are not participating. Globalization,has not been inclusive.,The second Achilles' heel is complexity --,a growing fragility, a growing brittleness.,What happens in one place very quickly affects everything else.,This is a systemic risk, systemic shock.,We've seen it in the financial crisis. We've seen it in the pandemic flu.,It will become virulent and it's something we have to build resilience against. 
 A lot of this is driven by what's happening in technology.,There have been huge leaps. There will be a million-fold improvement,in what you can get for the same price,in computing by 2030.,That's what the experience of the last 20 years has been.,It will continue.,Our computers, our systems will be as primitive,as the Apollo's are for today.,Our mobile phones are more powerful than the total Apollo space engine.,Our mobile phones are more powerful than,some of the strongest computers of 20 years ago.,So what will this do?,It will create huge opportunities in technology.,Miniaturization as well.,There will be invisible capacity. Invisible capacity in our bodies,,in our brains, and in the air.,This is a dust mite on a nanoreplica. 
 This sort of ability to do everything in new ways unleashes potential,,not least in the area of medicine.,This is a stem cell that we've developed here in Oxford,,from an embryonic stem cell.,We can develop any part of the body.,Increasingly, over time, this will be possible from our own skin --,able to replicate parts of the body.,Fantastic potential for regenerative medicine.,I don't think there will be a Special Olympics long after 2030,,because of this capacity to regenerate parts of the body.,But the question is, "Who will have it?" 
 The other major development is going to be,in the area of what can happen in genetics.,The capacity to create, as this mouse has been genetically modified,,something which goes three times faster,,lasts for three times longer, we could produce,,as this mouse can, to the age of our equivalent of 80 years,,using about the same amount of food.,But will this only be available for the super rich,,for those that can afford it? Are we headed for a new eugenics?,Will only those that are able to afford it,be able to be this super race of the future?,(Laughter) 
 So the big question for us is,,"How do we manage this technological change?",How do we ensure that it creates,a more inclusive technology,,a technology which means,that not only as we grow older,,that we can also grow wiser, and that we're able to support,the populations of the future?,One of the most dramatic manifestations of these improvements,will be moving from population pyramids,to what we might term population coffins.,There is unlikely to be a pension,or a retirement age in 2030.,These will be redundant concepts. And this isn't only something of the West. 
 The most dramatic changes will be the skyscraper,type of new pyramids,that will take place in China and in many other countries.,So forget about retirements if you're young.,Forget about pensions. Think about life and where it's going to be going.,Of course, migration will become even more important.,The war on talent, the need to attract people,at all skill ranges,,to push us around in our wheelchairs,,but also to drive our economies. Our innovation will be vital. 
 The employment in the rich countries,will go down from about 800,to about 700 million of these people.,This would imply a massive leap in migration.,So the concerns, the xenophobic concerns of today,,of migration, will be turned on their head,,as we search for people to help us sort out,our pensions and our economies in the future.,And then, the systemic risks.,We understand that these will become much more virulent,,that what we see today,is this interweaving of societies, of systems,,fastened by technologies and hastened by just-in-time management systems.,Small levels of stock push resilience into other people's responsibility. 
 The collapse in biodiversity,,climate change, pandemics, financial crises:,these will be the currency that we will think about.,And so a new awareness will have to arise,,of how we deal with these, how we mobilize ourselves,,in a new way, and come together as a community,to manage systemic risk.,It's going to require innovation.,It's going to require an understanding that the glory of globalization,could also be its downfall.,This could be our best century ever because of the achievements,,or it could be our worst.,And of course we need to worry about the individuals,,particularly the individuals that feel that they've,been left out in one way or another. 
 An individual, for the first time in the history of humanity,,will have the capacity, by 2030,,to destroy the planet, to wreck everything,,through the creation, for example, of a biopathogen.,How do we begin to weave these tapestries together?,How do we think about complex systems in new ways?,That will be the challenge of the scholars,,and of all of us engaged in thinking about the future.,The rest of our lives will be in the future. We need to prepare for it now.,We need to understand that the governance structure in the world is fossilized.,It cannot begin to cope with the challenges that this will bring.,We have to develop a new way of managing the planet,,collectively, through collective wisdom. 
 We know, and I know from my own experience,,that amazing things can happen,,when individuals and societies come together,to change their future.,I left South Africa, and 15 years later,,after thinking I would never go back,,I had the privilege and the honor to work in the government of Nelson Mandela.,This was a miracle. We can create miracles,,collectively, in our lifetime.,It is vital that we do so.,It is vital that the ideas that are nurtured in TED,,that the ideas that we think about,look forward, and make sure that this will be the most glorious century,,and not one of eco-disaster and eco-collapse.,Thank you. (Applause)Most of the time, art and science stare at each other,across a gulf of mutual incomprehension.,There is great confusion when the two look at each other.,Art, of course, looks at the world through the psyche,,the emotions -- the unconscious at times -- and of course the aesthetic.,Science tends to look at the world through the rational, the quantitative --,things that can be measured and described --,but it gives art a terrific context of understanding. 
 In the Extreme Ice Survey,,we're dedicated to bringing those two parts of human understanding together,,to merging the art and science,to the end of helping us understand nature,and humanity's relationship with nature better.,Specifically, I as a person,who's been a professional nature photographer my whole adult life,,am firmly of the belief that photography, video, film,have tremendous powers for helping us understand,and shape the way we think about nature,and about ourselves in relationship to nature. 
 In this project, we're specifically interested, of course, in ice.,I'm fascinated by the beauty of it, the mutability of it,,the malleability of it,,and the fabulous shapes in which it can carve itself.,These first images are from Greenland.,But ice has another meaning.,Ice is the canary in the global coal mine.,It's the place where we can see and touch and hear and feel climate change in action. 
 Climate change is a really abstract thing in most of the world.,Whether or not you believe in it is based on your sense of,is it raining more or is it raining less?,Is it getting hotter or is it getting colder?,What do the computer models say about this, that and the other thing?,All of that, strip it away. In the world of the arctic and alpine environments,,where the ice is, it's real and it's present.,The changes are happening. They're very visible.,They're photographable. They're measurable. 
 95 percent of the glaciers in the world are retreating or shrinking.,That's outside Antarctica.,95 percent of the glaciers in the world are retreating or shrinking,,and that's because the precipitation patterns and the temperature patterns are changing.,There is no significant scientific dispute about that.,It's been observed, it's measured, it's bomb-proof information.,And the great irony and tragedy of our time,is that a lot of the general public thinks that science is still arguing about that.,Science is not arguing about that.,In these images we see ice from enormous glaciers,,ice sheets that are hundreds of thousands of years old,breaking up into chunks, and chunk by chunk by chunk,,iceberg by iceberg, turning into global sea level rise. 
 So, having seen all of this in the course of a 30-year career,,I was still a skeptic about climate change until about 10 years ago,,because I thought the story of climate change was based on computer models.,I hadn't realized it was based on concrete measurements,of what the paleoclimates -- the ancient climates -- were,,as recorded in the ice sheets, as recorded in deep ocean sediments,,as recorded in lake sediments, tree rings,,and a lot of other ways of measuring temperature. 
 When I realized that climate change was real, and it was not based on computer models,,I decided that one day I would do a project,looking at trying to manifest climate change photographically.,And that led me to this project.,Initially, I was working on a National Geographic assignment --,conventional, single frame, still photography.,And one crazy day, I got the idea that I should --,after that assignment was finished --,I got the idea that I should shoot in time-lapse photography,,that I should station a camera or two at a glacier,and let it shoot every 15 minutes, or every hour or whatever,and watch the progression of the landscape over time. 
 Well, within about three weeks,,I incautiously turned that idea of a couple of time-lapse cameras,into 25 time-lapse cameras.,And the next six months of my life were the hardest time in my career,,trying to design, build and deploy out in the field these 25 time-lapse cameras.,They are powered by the sun. Solar panels power them.,Power goes into a battery. There is a custom made computer,that tells the camera when to fire.,And these cameras are positioned on rocks on the sides of the glaciers,,and they look in on the glacier from permanent, bedrock positions,,and they watch the evolution of the landscape.,We just had a number of cameras out on the Greenland Ice Sheet.,We actually drilled holes into the ice, way deep down below the thawing level,,and had some cameras out there for the past month and a half or so.,Actually, there's still a camera out there right now.,In any case, the cameras shoot roughly every hour.,Some of them shoot every half hour, every 15 minutes, every five minutes. 
 Here's a time lapse of one of the time-lapse units being made.,(Laughter),I personally obsessed about every nut, bolt and washer in these crazy things.,I spent half my life at our local hardware store,during the months when we built these units originally. 
 We're working in most of the major glaciated regions of the northern hemisphere.,Our time-lapse units are in Alaska, the Rockies, Greenland and Iceland,,and we have repeat photography positions,,that is places we just visit on an annual basis,,in British Columbia, the Alps and Bolivia. 
 It's a big undertaking. I stand here before you tonight,as an ambassador for my whole team.,There's a lot of people working on this right now.,We've got 33 cameras out this moment.,We just had 33 cameras shoot about half an hour ago,all across the northern hemisphere, watching what's happened.,And we've spent a lot of time in the field. It's been a fantastic amount of work.,We've been out for two and a half years,,and we've got about another two and a half years yet to go. 
 That's only half our job.,The other half of our job is to tell the story to the global public.,You know, scientists have collected this kind of information,off and on over the years, but a lot of it stays within the science community.,Similarly, a lot of art projects stay in the art community,,and I feel very much a responsibility through mechanisms like TED,,and like our relationship with the Obama White House,,with the Senate, with John Kerry, to influence policy,as much as possible with these pictures as well.,We've done films. We've done books. We have more coming.,We have a site on Google Earth,that Google Earth was generous enough to give us,,and so forth, because we feel very much the need to tell this story,,because it is such an immediate evidence of ongoing climate change right now. 
 Now, one bit of science before we get into the visuals.,If everybody in the developed world understood this graph,,and emblazoned it on the inside of their foreheads,,there would be no further societal argument about climate change,because this is the story that counts.,Everything else you hear is just propaganda and confusion.,Key issues: this is a 400,000 year record.,This exact same pattern is seen going back now,almost a million years before our current time.,And several things are important. 
 Number one: temperature and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,go up and down basically in sync.,You can see that from the orange line and the blue line.,Nature naturally has allowed carbon dioxide to go up to 280 parts per million.,That's the natural cycle.,Goes up to 280 and then drops,for various reasons that aren't important to discuss right here.,But 280 is the peak.,Right now, if you look at the top right part of that graph,,we're at 385 parts per million.,We are way, way outside the normal, natural variability.,Earth is having a fever.,In the past hundred years, the temperature of the Earth,has gone up 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit, .75 degrees Celsius,,and it's going to keep going up,because we keep dumping fossil fuels into the atmosphere.,At the rate of about two and a half parts per million per year.,It's been a remorseless, steady increase. 
 We have to turn that around.,That's the crux, and someday I hope to emblazon that,across Times Square in New York and a lot of other places.,But anyway, off to the world of ice. 
 We're now at the Columbia Glacier in Alaska.,This is a view of what's called the calving face.,This is what one of our cameras saw over the course of a few months.,You see the glacier flowing in from the right,,dropping off into the sea, camera shooting every hour.,If you look in the middle background,,you can see the calving face bobbing up and down like a yo-yo.,That means that glacier's floating and it's unstable,,and you're about to see the consequences of that floating.,To give you a little bit of a sense of scale,,that calving face in this picture,is about 325 feet tall. That's 32 stories.,This is not a little cliff. This is like a major office building in an urban center.,The calving face is the wall where the visible ice breaks off,,but in fact, it goes down below sea level another couple thousand feet.,So there's a wall of ice a couple thousand feet deep,going down to bedrock if the glacier's grounded on bedrock,,and floating if it isn't. 
 Here's what Columbia's done. This is in south central Alaska.,This was an aerial picture I did one day in June three years ago.,This is an aerial picture we did this year.,That's the retreat of this glacier.,The main stem, the main flow of the glacier is coming from the right,and it's going very rapidly up that stem.,We're going to be up there in just a few more weeks,,and we expect that it's probably retreated another half a mile,,but if I got there and discovered that it had collapsed,and it was five miles further back, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised. 
 Now it's really hard to grasp the scale of these places,,because as the glaciers --,one of the things is that places like Alaska and Greenland are huge,,they're not normal landscapes --,but as the glaciers are retreating, they're also deflating,,like air is being let out of a balloon.,And so, there are features on this landscape.,There's a ridge right in the middle of the picture, up above where that arrow comes in,,that shows you that a little bit.,There's a marker line called the trim line,above our little red illustration there.,This is something no self-respecting photographer would ever do --,you put some cheesy illustration on your shot, right? --,and yet you have to do it sometimes to narrate these points.,But, in any case, the deflation of this glacier since 1984,has been higher than the Eiffel Tower, higher than the Empire State Building. 
 A tremendous amount of ice has been let out of these valleys,as it's retreated and deflated, gone back up valley.,These changes in the alpine world are accelerating.,It's not static.,Particularly in the world of sea ice,,the rate of natural change is outstripping predictions of just a few years ago,,and the processes either are accelerating,or the predictions were too low to begin with.,But in any case, there are big, big changes happening as we speak. 
 So, here's another time-lapse shot of Columbia.,And you see where it ended in these various spring days,,June, May, then October.,Now we turn on our time lapse.,This camera was shooting every hour.,Geologic process in action here.,And everybody says, well don't they advance in the winter time?,No. It was retreating through the winter because it's an unhealthy glacier.,Finally catches up to itself, it advances. 
 And you can look at these pictures over and over again,because there's such a strange, bizarre fascination in seeing,these things you don't normally get to see come alive.,We've been talking about "seeing is believing ",and seeing the unseen at TED Global.,That's what you see with these cameras.,The images make the invisible visible.,These huge crevasses open up.,These great ice islands break off --,and now watch this.,This has been the springtime this year --,a huge collapse. That happened in about a month,,the loss of all that ice. 
 So that's where we started three years ago,,way out on the left, and that's where we were a few months ago, the,last time we went into Columbia.,To give you a feeling for the scale of the retreat,,we did another cheesy illustration,,with British double-decker buses.,If you line up 295 of those nose to tail, that's about how far back that was.,It's a long way. 
 On up to Iceland.,One of my favorite glaciers, the Sólheimajökull.,And here, if you watch, you can see the terminus retreating.,You can see this river being formed.,You can see it deflating.,Without the photographic process, you would never see this. This is invisible.,You can stand up there your whole life and you would never see this,,but the camera records it. 
 So we wind time backwards now.,We go back a couple years in time.,That's where it started.,That's where it ended a few months ago. 
 And on up to Greenland.,The smaller the ice mass, the faster it responds to climate.,Greenland took a little while to start reacting,to the warming climate of the past century,,but it really started galloping along about 20 years ago.,And there's been a tremendous increase in the temperature up there. 
 It's a big place. That's all ice.,All those colors are ice and it goes up to about two miles thick,,just a gigantic dome that comes in from the coast and rises in the middle.,The one glacier up in Greenland,that puts more ice into the global ocean,than all the other glaciers in the northern hemisphere combined,is the Ilulissat Glacier. 
 We have some cameras on the south edge of the Ilulissat,,watching the calving face as it goes through this dramatic retreat.,Here's a two-year record of what that looks like.,Helicopter in front of the calving face for scale, quickly dwarfed.,The calving face is four and a half miles across,,and in this shot, as we pull back, you're only seeing about a mile and a half.,So, imagine how big this is,and how much ice is charging out.,The interior of Greenland is to the right.,It's flowing out to the Atlantic Ocean on the left.,Icebergs, many, many, many, many times the size of this building, are roaring out to sea. 
 We just downloaded these pictures a couple weeks ago,,as you can see. June 25th,,monster calving events happened.,I'll show you one of those in a second. 
 This glacier has doubled its flow speed in the past 15 years.,It now goes at 125 feet a day, dumping all this ice into the ocean.,It tends to go in these pulses, about every three days,,but on average, 125 feet a day,,twice the rate it did 20 years ago. 
 Okay. We had a team out watching this glacier,,and we recorded the biggest calving event that's ever been put on film.,We had nine cameras going.,This is what a couple of the cameras saw.,A 400-foot-tall calving face breaking off.,Huge icebergs rolling over.,Okay, how big was that? It's hard to get it.,So an illustration again, gives you a feeling for scale.,A mile of retreat in 75 minutes,across the calving face, in that particular event, three miles wide.,The block was three-fifths of a mile deep,,and if you compare the expanse of the calving face,to the Tower Bridge in London, about 20 bridges wide.,Or if you take an American reference, to the U.S. Capitol Building,and you pack 3,000 Capitol Buildings into that block,,it would be equivalent to how large that block was.,75 minutes. 
 Now I've come to the conclusion,after spending a lot of time in this climate change world,that we don't have a problem of economics, technology and public policy.,We have a problem of perception.,The policy and the economics and the technology are serious enough issues,,but we actually can deal with them.,I'm certain that we can.,But what we have is a perception problem,because not enough people really get it yet.,You're an elite audience. You get it.,Fortunately, a lot of the political leaders in the major countries of the world,are an elite audience that for the most part gets it now.,But we still need to bring a lot of people along with us.,And that's where I think organizations like TED,,like the Extreme Ice Survey can have a terrific impact,on human perception and bring us along.,Because I believe we have an opportunity right now. 
 We are nearly on the edge of a crisis,,but we still have an opportunity to face the greatest challenge,of our generation and, in fact, of our century.,This is a terrific, terrific call to arms,to do the right thing for ourselves and for the future.,I hope that we have the wisdom to let the angels of our better nature,rise to the occasion and do what needs to be done. Thank you. 
 (Applause)So the question is, what is invisible?,There is more of it than you think, actually.,Everything, I would say. Everything that matters,except every thing and except matter. 
 We can see matter. But we can't see what's the matter.,As in this cryptic sentence I found in The Guardian recently:,"The marriage suffered a setback in 1965,,when the husband was killed by the wife.",(Laughter),There's a world of invisibility there, isn't there?,(Laughter) 
 So, we can see the stars and the planets,,but we can't see what holds them apart,or what draws them together.,With matter, as with people, we see only the skin of things.,We can't see into the engine room.,We can't see what makes people tick, at least not without difficulty.,And the closer we look at anything, the more it disappears.,In fact, if you look really closely at stuff,,if you look at the basic substructure of matter,,there isn't anything there.,Electrons disappear in a kind of fuzz,,and there is only energy. And you can't see energy. 
 So everything that matters, that's important, is invisible.,One slightly silly thing that's invisible,is this story, which is invisible to you.,And I'm now going to make it visible to you in your minds.,It's about an M.P. called Geoffrey Dickens. 
 The late Geoffrey Dickens, M.P. was attending a fete in his constituency.,Wherever he went, at every stall he stopped he was closely followed,by a devoted smiling woman of indescribable ugliness.,(Laughter),Try as he might, he couldn't get away from her.,A few days later he received a letter from a constituent,saying how much she admired him,,had met him at a fete and asking for a signed photograph.,After her name, written in brackets was the apt description, horse face.,(Laughter) 
 "I've misjudged this women," thought Mr. Dickens.,"Not only is she aware of her physical repulsiveness,,she turns it to her advantage.,A photo is not enough.",So he went out and bought a plastic frame to put the photograph in.,And on the photograph, he wrote with a flourish,,"To Horse Face, with love from Geoffrey Dickens, M.P.",After it had been sent off, his secretary said to him,,"Did you get that letter from the woman at the fete?,I wrote Horse Face on her, so you'd remember who she was.",(Laughter) 
 I bet he thought he wished he was invisible, don't you?,(Laughter) 
 So, one of the interesting things about invisibility,is that things that we can't see,we also can't understand.,Gravity is one thing that we can't see,and which we don't understand.,It's the least understood of all the four fundamental forces,,and the weakest.,And nobody really knows what it is or why it's there. 
 For what it's worth, Sir Isaac Newton, the greatest scientist who ever lived,,he thought Jesus came to Earth specifically to operate the levers of gravity.,That's what he thought he was there for.,So, bright guy, could be wrong on that one, I don't know.,(Laughter) 
 Consciousness. I see all your faces.,I have no idea what any of you are thinking. Isn't that amazing?,Isn't that incredible that we can't read each other's minds?,But we can touch each other, taste each other perhaps, if we get close enough.,But we can't read each other's minds. I find that quite astonishing. 
 In the Sufi faith, this great Middle Eastern religion,,which some claim is the route of all religions,,Sufi masters are all telepaths, so they say.,But their main exercise of telepathy,is to send out powerful signals to the rest of us that it doesn't exist.,So that's why we don't think it exists,,the Sufi masters working on us. 
 In the question of consciousness,and artificial intelligence,,artificial intelligence has really, like the study of consciousness,,gotten nowhere. We have no idea how consciousness works.,With artificial intelligence, not only have they not created artificial intelligence,,they haven't yet created artificial stupidity.,(Laughter) 
 The laws of physics: invisible, eternal, omnipresent, all-powerful.,Remind you of anyone?,Interesting. I'm, as you can guess,,not a materialist, I'm an immaterialist.,And I've found a very useful new word, ignostic. Okay?,I'm an ignostic.,I refuse to be drawn on the question of whether God exists,,until somebody properly defines the terms.,(Laughter) 
 Another thing we can't see is the human genome.,And this is increasingly peculiar,,because about 20 years ago, when they started delving into the genome,,they thought it would probably contain around 100,000 genes.,Geneticists will know this, but every year since,,it's been revised downwards.,We now think there are likely to be only just over 20,000,genes in the human genome. 
 This is extraordinary. Because rice -- get this --,rice is known to have 38 thousand genes.,Potatoes, potatoes have 48 chromosomes. Do you know that?,Two more than people,,and the same as a gorilla.,(Laughter),You can't see these things, but they are very strange.,(Laughter) 
 The stars by day. I always think that's fascinating.,The universe disappears.,The more light there is, the less you can see. 
 Time, nobody can see time.,I don't know if you know this. Modern physics,,there is a big movement in modern physics,to decide that time doesn't really exist,,because it's too inconvenient for the figures.,It's much easier if it's not really there.,You can't see the future, obviously.,And you can't see the past, except in your memory. 
 One of the interesting things about the past is,you particularly can't see. My son asked me this the other day,,he said, "Dad, can you remember what I was like when I was two?",And I said, "Yes." And he said, "Why can't I?" 
 Isn't that extraordinary? You cannot remember,what happened to you earlier than the age of two or three,,which is great news for psychoanalysts,,because otherwise they'd be out of a job.,Because that's where all the stuff happens,(Laughter),that makes you who you are. 
 Another thing you can't see is the grid on which we hang.,This is fascinating. You probably know, some of you,,that cells are continually renewed. You can see it in skin and this kind of stuff.,Skin flakes off, hairs grow, nails, that kind of stuff.,But every cell in your body is replaced at some point.,Taste buds, every 10 days or so.,Livers and internal organs sort of take a bit longer. A spine takes several years.,But at the end of seven years, not one cell in your body,remains from what was there seven years ago.,The question is, who, then, are we?,What are we? What is this thing that we hang on,,that is actually us? 
 Okay. Atoms, you can't see them.,Nobody ever will. They're smaller than the wavelength of light.,Gas, you can't see that.,Interesting. Somebody mentioned 1600 recently.,Gas was invented in 1600,by a Dutch chemist called Van Helmont.,It's said to be the most successful ever invention,of a word by a known individual.,Quite good. He also invented a word called "blas,",meaning astral radiation.,Didn't catch on, unfortunately.,(Laughter),But well done, him.,(Laughter) 
 There is so many things that -- Light.,You can't see light. When it's dark, in a vacuum,,if a person shines a beam of light straight across your eyes,,you won't see it. Slightly technical, some physicists will disagree with this.,But it's odd that you can't see the beam of light,,you can only see what it hits.,I find that extraordinary, not to be able to see light,,not to be able to see darkness. 
 Electricity, you can't see that.,Don't let anyone tell you they understand electricity.,They don't. Nobody knows what it is.,(Laughter),You probably think the electrons in an electric wire,move instantaneously down a wire, don't you, at the speed of light,when you turn the light on. They don't.,Electrons bumble down the wire,,about the speed of spreading honey, they say.,(Laughter) 
 Galaxies, 100 billion of them estimated in the universe.,100 billion. How many can we see? Five.,Five out of the 100 billion galaxies, with the naked eye,,and one of them is quite difficult to see unless you've got very good eyesight. 
 Radio waves. There's another thing.,Heinrich Hertz, when he discovered radio waves in 1887,,he called them radio waves because they radiated.,And somebody said to him,,"Well what's the point of these, Heinrich?,What's the point of these radio waves that you've found?",And he said, "Well, I've no idea.,But I guess somebody will find a use for them someday.",And that's what they do, radio. That's what they discovered. 
 Anyway, so the biggest thing,that's invisible to us is what we don't know.,It is incredible how little we know.,Thomas Edison once said,,"We don't know one percent of one millionth,about anything." 
 And I've come to the conclusion --,because you've asked this other question, "What's another thing you can't see?",The point, most of us. What's the point?,(Laughter),(Applause),You can't see a point. It's by definition dimensionless,,like an electron, oddly enough. 
 But the point, what I've got it down to,,is there are only two questions really worth asking.,"Why are we here?" and "What should we do about it while we are?,And to help you, I've got two things to leave you with, from two great philosophers,,perhaps two of the greatest philosopher thinkers of the 20th century,,one a mathematician and an engineer, and the other a poet. 
 The first is Ludwig Wittgenstein who said,,"I don't know why we are here.,But I'm pretty sure it's not in order to enjoy ourselves.",(Laughter),He was a cheerful bastard wasn't he?,(Laughter) 
 And secondly and lastly, W.H. Auden,,one of my favorite poets, who said,,"We are here on earth,to help others.,What the others are here for, I've no idea.",(Laughter),(Applause)I'm going to tell you about one of the world's largest problems,and how it can be solved. 
 I'd like to start with a little experiment.,Could you put your hand up if you wear glasses or contact lenses,,or you've had laser refractive surgery?,Now, unfortunately, there are too many of you for me to do the statistics properly.,But it looks like -- I'm guessing -- that it'll be about 60 percent of the room,because that's roughly the fraction of developed world population,that have some sort of vision correction. 
 The World Health Organization estimates --,well, they make various estimates of the number of people who need glasses --,the lowest estimate is 150 million people.,They also have an estimate of around a billion.,But in fact, I would argue that we've just done an experiment here and now,,which shows us that the global need for corrective eyewear,is around half of any population.,And the problem of poor vision, is actually not just a health problem,,it's also an educational problem,,and it's an economic problem, and it's a quality of life problem. 
 Glasses are not very expensive. They're quite plentiful.,The problem is, there aren't enough eye care professionals in the world,to use the model of the delivery of corrective eyewear,that we have in the developed world.,There are just way too few eye care professionals. 
 So this little slide here shows you an optometrist,and the little blue person represents about 10,000 people,and that's the ratio in the U.K.,This is the ratio of optometrists to people in sub-Saharan Africa.,In fact, there are some countries in sub-Saharan Africa,where there's one optometrist for eight million of the population. 
 How do you do this? How do you solve this problem?,I came up with a solution to this problem,,and I came up with a solution based on adaptive optics for this.,And the idea is you make eye glasses, and you adjust them yourself,and that solves the problem. 
 What I want to do is to show you that one can make a pair of glasses.,I shall just show you how you make a pair of glasses. I shall pop this in my pocket.,I'm short sighted. I look at the signs at the end, I can hardly see them.,So -- okay, I can now see that man running out there,,and I can see that guy running out there.,I've now made prescription eyewear to my prescription.,Next step in my process.,So, I've now made eye glasses to my prescription.,Okay, so I've made these glasses and ...,Okay, I've made the glasses to my prescription and ...,... I've just ...,And I've now made some glasses. That's it. 
 (Applause) 
 Now, these aren't the only pair in the world.,In fact, this technology's been evolving.,I started working on it in 1985,,and it's been evolving very slowly.,There are about 30,000 in use now.,And they're in fifteen countries. They're spread around the world. 
 And I have a vision, which I'll share with you.,I have a global vision for vision.,And that vision is to try to get a billion people,wearing the glasses they need by the year 2020.,To do that -- this is an early example of the technology.,The technology is being further developed --,the cost has to be brought down.,This pair, in fact, these currently cost about 19 dollars.,But the cost has to be brought right down.,It has to be brought down because we're trying to serve populations,who live on a dollar a day. 
 How do you solve this problem?,You start to get into detail.,And on this slide, I'm basically explaining all the problems you have.,How do you distribute? How do you work out how to fit the thing?,How do you have people realizing that they have a vision problem?,How do you deal with the industry?,And the answer to that is research. 
 What we've done is to set up the Center for Vision in the Developing World,here in the university.,If you want to know more, just come have a look at our website. Thank you. 
 (Applause)One morning, in the year 1957,,the neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield,saw himself like this,,a weird freak with huge hands,,huge mouth,,and a tiny bottom.,Actually this creature,is the result of the Penfield research.,He named it homunculus.,Basically the homunculus is,the visualization of a human being,where each part of the body is proportional,to the surface it takes in the brain.,So, of course, homunculus is definitely not a freak.,It's you. It's me.,It's our invisible reality.,This visualization could explain, for example,,why newborns, or smokers,,put, instinctively, their fingers in the mouth.,Unfortunately it doesn't explain why,so many designers remain mainly interested,in designing chairs. 
 So anyway, even if I do not understand science entirely,,for my design I essentially refer to it.,I'm fascinated by its ability to,deeply investigate the human being,,its way of working, its way of feeling.,And it really helps me to understand,how we see, how we hear,,how we breathe, how our brain can inform or mislead us.,It's a great tool for me,to understand what could be our real needs. 
 Marketing people have never been able to do that.,Marketing reduces things. Marketing simplifies.,Marketing creates user groups.,And scientists, amidst complexity,,amidst fluctuation and uniqueness.,What could be our real needs?,Maybe the silence.,In our daily life we are continuously disturbed by,aggressive sounds.,And you know all those kind of sound puts us,in a kind of stressful state,,and prevent us from being quiet and focused.,So I wanted to create a kind of,sound filter,,able to preserve ourselves from noise pollution.,But I didn't want it to make it by,isolating people, without any earmuffs,or those kind of things.,Or neither with including complex technology.,I just wanted to, using the complexity,and the technology of the brain, of the human brain. 
 So I worked with white noise.,dB is basically --,dB is the name of the product,,basically a white noise diffuser.,This is white noise.,The white noise is the sum of all frequencies,that are audible by the human being,,brought to the same intensity.,And this noise is like a "shhhhhhhhhhhhh," like that.,And this noise is the most neutral.,It is the perfect sound for our ears and our brain.,So when you hear this sound,you feel like a kind of shelter,,preserved from noise pollution.,And when you hear the white noise, your brain is immediately focused on it.,And do not be disturbed any more by the other aggressive sound.,It seems to be magic.,But it is just physiology. It's just in your brain.,And in mine, I hope. 
 So in order to make this white noise,a little bit active and reactive,,I create a ball, a rolling ball,able to analyze and find,where does aggressive sound come from,,and roll, at home or at work,,towards aggressive noise,,and emits white noise in order to neutralize it.,(Laughter),It works.,You feel the effect of the white noise?,It's too in silence.,If you make some noise you can feel the effect. 
 So even if this object,,even if this product includes some technology,,it includes some speakers, it includes some microphones,and some electronic devices,,this object is not a very smart object.,And I don't want to make a very smart object.,I don't want to create a perfect object like a perfect robot.,I want to create an object like you and me.,So, definitely not perfect.,So imagine, for instance, you are at home.,A loving dispute with your girl or boyfriend.,You shout. You say, "Blah blah blah, Blah blah blah. Who is this guy?",And dB will probably roll toward you.,And turning around you is "shhhhhhh," like that.,(Laughter),Definitely not perfect. So you would probably,shut it, at this point.,(Laughter) 
 Anyway, in this same kind of approach,,I designed K.,K is a daylight receiver transmitter.,So this object is supposed to be displayed on your desk,,or on your piano, where you are supposed,to spend most of your time in the day.,And this object will be,able to know exactly the quantity of light you receive during the day,,and able to give you the quantity of light you need.,This object is completely covered by,fiber opticals.,And the idea of those fiber opticals is to inform the object, for sure,,but creates the idea of an,eye sensibility of the object.,I want, by this design,feel, when you see it,,you see, instinctively,,this object seems to be very sensitive,,very reactive.,And this object knows, better than you,and probably before you, what you really need.,You have to know that the lack of daylight,can provoke some,problem of energy, or problem of libido.,So, a huge problem.,(Laughter) 
 Most of the projects I work on --,I live in collaboration with scientists.,I'm just a designer. So I need them.,So there can be some biologists,,psychiatrists, mathematicians, and so on.,And I submit them, my intuitions,,my hypothesis, my first ideas.,And they react. They told me what is possible, what is impossible.,And together we improve the original concept.,And we build the project to the end.,And this kind of relationship between designer and scientist,started when I was at school. 
 Indeed in my studies I was a guinea pig,for a pharmaceutical industry.,And the irony for me was,of course, I didn't do that for the sake of science progress.,I just do that to make money.,Anyway, this project, or this experience,,make me start a new project on the design of medicine.,You have to know that today, roughly one or two every drug pills,is not taken correctly.,So even if the active constituents,in pharmaceuticals made constant progress,in terms of chemistry, target of stability,,the behavior of the patients,goes more and more unstable.,So we took too many of them.,We took irregular dosage.,We do not follow instructions. And so on. 
 So I wanted to create a,new kind of medicine,,in order to create a new kind of relationship,between the patient and the treatment.,So I turned traditional pills into this.,I'm going to give you some example.,This one is an antibiotic.,And its purpose is to help patient,to go to the end of the treatment.,And the concept is to,create a kind of onion,,a kind of structure in layers.,So, you start with the darkest one.,And you are helped to visualize the duration of the treatment.,And you are helped to visualize the decrease of the infection.,So the first day, this is the big one.,And you have to peel and eat one layer a day.,And your antibiotic goes smaller and clearer.,And you're waiting for recovery as you were waiting for the Christmas day.,And you follow the treatment like that,,to the end of the treatment.,And here you can get the white core.,And it means, right, you are in the recovery.,(Applause) Thank you. 
 This one is a "third lung,",a pharmaceutical device for long-term asthma treatment.,I designed it to help kids to follow the treatment.,So the idea of this one is to create,a relationship between the patient of the treatment,but a relationship of dependency.,But in this case it is not the medication that is dependent on the patient.,This is, the kids will feel,the therapeutic object needs him.,So the idea is, all night long,the elastic skin of the third lung,will slowly inflate itself,,including air and molecules, for sure.,And when the kids wake up,,he can see the object needs him. And he take him to his mouth,,and breathe the air it contains.,So by this way,,the kid, to take care of himself,,is to take care of this living object.,And he does not feel anymore it's relies on asthma treatment,,as the asthma treatment needs him.,(Applause) 
 In this guise of living object approach,,I like the idea of a kind of invisible design,,as if the function of the object,exists in a kind of invisible field,just around the objects themselves.,We could talk about a kind of soul,,of a ghost accompanying them.,And almost a kind of poltergeist effect.,So when a passive object like this one seems to be alive,,because it is -- woosh -- starting to move. 
 And I remember an exhibition design,I made for John Maeda,,and for the Fondation Cartier in Paris.,And John Maeda was supposed to show,several graphic animations in this exhibition.,And my idea for this exhibition design was to create,a real pong game, like this one.,And the idea was to create some self-moving benches,in the main exhibition room.,So the living benches would be exactly like the ball.,And John was so excited by this idea. He said to me, "Okay let's go.",I remember the day of the opening.,I was a little bit late.,When I bring the 10 living and self-moving benches,in the exhibition room, John was just beside me,,and was like, "Hmm. Hmm.",And he told me, after a long silence,,"I wonder, Mathieu, if,people won't be more fascinated by your benches,than by my videos.",(Laughter),It would be a great honor, a great compliment for me,,if he hadn't decided to take all them off,two hours before the opening.,So, huge tragedy. 
 I guess you won't be surprised if I tell you,that Pinocchio is one of my great influences.,Pinocchio is probably one of my best design products, my favorite one.,Because it is a kind of object with a conscience,,able to be modified by its surroundings,,and able to modify it as well.,The other great influence is the mine's canary.,In coal mines, this canary,was supposed to be close to the miners.,And it was singing all day long. And when it stops it means that it just died.,So this canary was a living alarm,,and a very efficient one.,A very natural technology,,in order to say to the miners,,"The air is too bad. You have to go. It's an emergency.",So it's, for me, a great product. 
 And I tried to design a kind of canary.,Andrea is one.,Andrea is a living air filter that absorbs toxic gasses,from air, contaminated indoor air.,So it uses some plants to do this job,,selected for their gas-filtering ability.,You have to know, or you probably already know,,that indoor air pollution is more toxic than outdoor one.,So while I'm talking to you,,the seats you are sitting on are currently emitting some,invisible and odorless toxic gas. Sorry for that. (Laughter),So you are currently breathing formaldehyde.,It's the same for me with the carpet.,And this is exactly the same at home.,Because all the product we get constantly give away,the volatile component of which they're made of. 
 So let's have a look at your home.,So your sofa, your plastic chair,,your kid's toys,give their own invisible reality. And this one is very toxic.,This is the reason why,I created, with David Edward,,a scientist of Harvard University,,an object able to absorb the toxic elements using those kind of plants.,But the idea is to force,the air to go in the effective part of the plants.,Because the roots of the plant are not very effective.,Bill Wolverton from NASA,analyzed it cleverly in the '70s.,So the idea is to create an object,able to force the air, and to be in contact at the right speed,at the right place, in all the effective parts of the plant.,So this is the final object.,It will be launched next September.,(Applause) 
 This one is kind of the same approach,because I include, in a product,like Andrea, some plants.,And in this one, plants are used for the water filtration ability.,And it includes some fishes as well.,But here, unlike Andrea,,here are supposed to be eaten.,Indeed, this object is a domestic farm,,for fishes and green.,So the idea of this object,is to be able to get at home,very local food.,The locavores,used to get food,taken in a radius of 100 miles.,Local River is able to provide you,food directly in your living room.,So the principle of this object,is to create an ecosystem,called aquaponics.,And the aquaponics is the dirty water of the fish,,by a water pump, feeds the plants above.,And the plants will filter, by the roots,,the dirty water of the fish.,After, it goes back into the fish tank. 
 After that you have two options.,Or you sit down in front of it like you would do in front your TV set.,Amazing channel.,Or you start fishing.,And you make some sushis with a fish,and the aromatic plants above.,Because you can grow some potatoes.,No, not potatoes, but tomatoes,,aromatic plants and so on. 
 So now we can breathe safely.,Now we can eat local food.,Now we can be treated by smart medicine.,Now we can be well-balanced in our biorhythm,with daylight.,But it was important to create a perfect place,,so I tried to,,in order to work and create.,So I designed, for an American scientist based in Paris,,a very stimulative, brain-stimulative office.,I wanted to create a perfect place,where you can work and play,,and where your body and your brain can work together. 
 So, in this office,,you do not work anymore at your desk, like a politician.,Your seat, your sleep and your play,on a big geodesic island made of leather.,See, like this one?,In this office you do not work and write and draw on a sheet of paper,,but you draw directly on a kind of huge whiteboard cave,,like a prehistoric scientist.,So you, like that, can make some sport during your work.,In this office,you do not need to go out,in order to be in contact with nature.,You include, directly, the nature in the floor of the office.,You can see it there. 
 This is an inspiration image,to lead this project of the office.,It really helped me to design it.,I never show it to my client. He would be so afraid.,(Laughter),Just for my workshop.,I guess it may be the revenge of the guinea pig I was.,But it's maybe the conviction,as monkey and homunculus we are.,All of us need to be considered according to our real nature.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)These are grim economic times,,fellow TEDsters, grim economic times indeed.,And so, I would like to cheer you up,with one of the great, albeit largely unknown,,commercial success stories,of the past 20 years.,Comparable, in its own very peculiar way,,to the achievements of Microsoft or Google.,And it's an industry which has bucked the current recession,with equanimity.,I refer to organized crime. 
 Now organized crime has been around,for a very long time, I hear you say,,and these would be wise words, indeed.,But in the last two decades,,it has experienced an unprecedented expansion,,now accounting for roughly 15 percent,of the world's GDP.,I like to call it the Global Shadow Economy,,or McMafia, for short. 
 So what triggered this extraordinary growth,in cross-border crime?,Well, of course, there is globalization,,technology, communications, all that stuff,,which we'll talk about a little bit later.,But first, I would like to take you back,to this event:,the collapse of communism.,All across Eastern Europe, a most momentous episode,in our post-war history. 
 Now it's time for full disclosure.,This event meant a great deal to me personally.,I had started smuggling books across the Iron Curtain,to Democratic opposition groups in Eastern Europe,,like Solidarity in Poland,,when I was in my teens.,I then started writing about Eastern Europe,,and eventually I became the BBC's chief correspondent for the region,,which is what I was doing in 1989.,And so when 425 million people,finally won the right,to choose their own governments,,I was ecstatic,,but I was also a touch worried,about some of the nastier things,lurking behind the wall. 
 It wasn't long, for example,,before ethnic nationalism,reared its bloody head,in Yugoslavia.,And amongst the chaos,,amidst the euphoria,,it took me a little while to understand,that some of the people who had wielded power,before 1989, in Eastern Europe,,continued to do so after the revolutions there.,Obviously there were characters like this.,But there were also some more unexpected people,who played a critical role in what was going on in Eastern Europe. 
 Like this character. Remember these guys?,They used to win the gold medals in weightlifting,and wrestling, every four years in the Olympics,,and they were the great celebrities of communism,,with a fabulous lifestyle to go with it.,They used to get great apartments in the center of town,,casual sex on tap,,and they could travel to the West very freely,,which was a great luxury at the time.,It may come as a surprise, but they played a critical role,in the emergence of the market economy,in Eastern Europe.,Or as I like to call them, they are,the midwives of capitalism.,Here are some of those same weightlifters,after their 1989 makeover. 
 Now in Bulgaria --,this photograph was taken in Bulgaria --,when communism collapsed all over Eastern Europe,,it wasn't just communism;,it was the state that collapsed as well.,That means your police force wasn't working.,The court system wasn't functioning properly.,So what was a business man in the brave new world,of East European capitalism going to do,to make sure that his contracts would be honored?,Well, he would turn to people who were called, rather prosaically,by sociologists, privatized law enforcement agencies.,We prefer to know them as the mafia.,And in Bulgaria, the mafia was soon joined,with 14,000 people,who were sacked from their jobs in the security services,between 1989 and 1991. 
 Now, when your state is collapsing,,your economy is heading south at a rate of knots,,the last people you want coming on to the labor market,are 14,000 men and women whose chief skills,are surveillance,,are smuggling, building underground networks,and killing people.,But that's what happened all over Eastern Europe.,Now, when I was working in the 1990s,,I spent most of the time covering,the appalling conflict in Yugoslavia. 
 And I couldn't help notice,that the people who were perpetrating the appalling atrocities,,the paramilitary organizations,,were actually the same people running,the organized criminal syndicates.,And I came to think that behind the violence,lay a sinister criminal enterprise.,And so I resolved to travel around the world,examining this global criminal underworld,by talking to policemen,,by talking to victims, by talking to consumers,of illicit goods and services.,But above all else, by talking to the gangsters themselves. 
 And the Balkans was a fabulous place to start.,Why? Well of course,there was the issue of law and order collapsing,,but also, as they say in the retail trade,,it's location, location, location.,And what I noticed at the beginning of my research,that the Balkans had turned into a vast transit zone,for illicit goods and services coming from all over the world.,Heroin, cocaine,,women being trafficked into prostitution,and precious minerals. 
 And where were they heading?,The European Union, which by now,was beginning to reap the benefits of globalization,,transforming it into,the most affluent consumer market in history,,eventually comprising some 500 million people.,And a significant minority,of those 500 million people,like to spend some of their leisure time and spare cash,sleeping with prostitutes,,sticking 50 Euro notes up their nose,and employing illegal migrant laborers. 
 Now, organized crime in a globalizing world,operates in the same way as any other business.,It has zones of production,,like Afghanistan and Columbia.,It has zones of distribution,,like Mexico and the Balkans.,And then, of course, it has zones of consumption,,like the European Union, Japan,and of course, the United States.,The zones of production and distribution,tend to lie in the developing world,,and they are often threatened by appalling violence,and bloodshed. 
 Take Mexico, for example.,Six thousand people killed there in the last 18 months,as a direct consequence of the cocaine trade.,But what about the Democratic Republic of Congo?,Since 1998, five million people have died there.,It's not a conflict you read about much in the newspapers,,but it's the biggest conflict on this planet,since the Second World War.,And why is it? Because mafias from all around the world,cooperate with local paramilitaries,in order to seize the supplies,of the rich mineral resources,of the region. 
 In the year 2000, 80 percent of the world's coltan,was sourced to the killing fields,of the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.,Now, coltan you will find in almost every mobile phone,,in almost every laptop,and games console.,The Congolese war lords were selling this stuff to the mafia,in exchange for weapons,,and the mafia would then sell it on to Western markets.,And it is this Western desire,to consume,that is the primary driver,of international organized crime. 
 Now, let me show you some of my friends in action,,caught conveniently on film by the Italian police,,and smuggling duty-not-paid cigarettes.,Now, cigarettes out the factory gate are very cheap.,The European Union then imposes the highest taxes on them in the world.,So if you can smuggle them into the E.U.,,there are very handsome profits to be made,,and I want to show you this to demonstrate,the type of resources available to these groups. 
 This boat is worth one million Euros when it's new.,And it's the fastest thing on European waters.,From 1994, for seven years,,20 of these boats,made the trip across the Adriatic,,from Montenegro to Italy, every single night.,And as a consequence of this trade,,Britain alone lost eight billion dollars in revenue.,And instead that money went to underwrite the wars in Yugoslavia,and line the pockets of unscrupulous individuals. 
 Now Italian police, when this trade started,,had just two boats which could go at the same speed.,And this is very important, because the only way you can catch these guys,is if they run out of gas.,Sometimes the gangsters would bring with them,women being trafficked into prostitution,,and if the police intervened, they would hurl,the women into the sea,so that the police had to go and save them from drowning,,rather than chasing the bad guys. 
 So I have shown you this to demonstrate,how many boats, how many vessels it takes,to catch one of these guys.,And the answer is six vessels.,And remember, 20 of these speed boats,were coming across the Adriatic,every single night.,So what were these guys doing with all the money they were making? 
 Well, this is where we come to globalization,,because that was not just the deregulation of global trade.,It was the liberalization of international financial markets.,And boy, did that make it easy,for the money launderers.,The last two decades have been the champagne era,for dirty lucre. 
 In the 1990s, we saw financial centers around the world,competing for their business,,and there was simply no effective mechanism,to prevent money laundering.,And a lot of licit banks were also happy,to accept deposits,from very dubious sources,without questions being asked. 
 But at the heart of this, is the offshore banking network.,Now these things,are an essential part of the money laundering parade,,and if you want to do something about illegal tax evasion,and transnational organized crime, money laundering,,you have to get rid of them.,On a positive note, we at last have someone in the White House,who has consistently spoken out,against these corrosive entities. 
 And if anyone is concerned about what I believe,is the necessity for,new legislation, regulation, effective regulation,,I say, let's take a look at Bernie Madoff,,who is now going to be spending the rest of his life in jail.,Bernie Madoff stole 65 billion dollars.,That puts him up there on the Olympus of gangsters,with the Colombian cartels,and the major Russian crime syndicates,,but he did this for decades,in the very heart of Wall Street,,and no regulator picked up on it.,So how many other Madoffs are there on Wall Street,or in the city of London,,fleecing ordinary folk,and money laundering?,Well I can tell you, it's quite a few of them. 
 Let me go on to the 101 of international organized crime now.,And that is narcotics. Our second marijuana farm photograph for the morning.,This one, however, is in central British Columbia,where I photographed it.,It's one of the tens of thousands,of mom-and-pop grow-ops in B.C.,which ensure that over five percent,of the province's GDP is accounted for by this trade. 
 Now, I was taken by inspector Brian Cantera,,of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,,to a cavernous warehouse east of Vancouver,to see some of the goods which are regularly confiscated,by the RCMP,from the smugglers who are sending it,,of course, down south to the United States,where there is an insatiable market,for B.C. Bud, as it's called,,in part because it's marketed as organic,,which of course goes down very well in California.,(Laughter),(Applause) 
 Now, even by the police's admission,,this makes not a dent in the profits, really,,of the major exporters.,Since the beginning of globalization,,the global narcotics market has expanded enormously.,There has, however, been no concomitant increase,in the resources available,to police forces. 
 This, however, may all be about to change,,because something very strange is going on.,The United Nations recognized,earlier this -- it was last month actually --,that Canada has become a key area of distribution and production,of ecstasy and other synthetic drugs. 
 Interestingly, the market share,of heroin and cocaine is going down,,because the pills are getting ever better at reproducing their highs.,Now that is a game changer,,because it shifts production away from the developing world,and into the Western world.,When that happens, it is a trend,which is set to overwhelm our policing capacity in the West.,The drugs policy which we've had in place for 40 years,is long overdue for a very serious rethink,,in my opinion. 
 Now, the recession.,Well, organized crime has already adapted,very well to the recession.,Not surprising, the most opportunistic industry,in the whole world.,And it has no rules to its regulatory system.,Except, of course, it has two business risks:,arrest by law enforcement,,which is, frankly, the least of their worries,,and competition from other groups,,i.e. a bullet in the back of the head. 
 What they've done is they've shifted their operations.,People don't smoke as much dope, or visit prostitutes quite so frequently,during a recession.,And so instead, they have invaded financial,and corporate crime in a big way,,but above all, two sectors,,and that is counterfeit goods,and cybercrime.,And it's been terribly successful.,I would like to introduce you to Mr. Pringle.,Or perhaps I should say, more accurately, Señor Pringle. 
 I was introduced to this bit of kit by a Brazilian cybercriminal.,We sat in a car on the Avenue Paulista,in São Paulo, together.,Hooked it up to my laptop,,and within about five minutes he had penetrated,the computer security system,of a major Brazilian bank.,It's really not that difficult.,And it's actually much easier because,the fascinating thing about cybercrime,is that it's not so much the technology. 
 The key to cybercrime is what we call social engineering.,Or to use the technical term for it,,there's one born every minute.,You would not believe how easy it is,to persuade people to do things with their computers,which are objectively not in their interest.,And it was very soon,when the cybercriminals learned that the quickest way to do this,,of course, the quickest way to a person's wallet,is through the promise of sex and love. 
 I expect some of you remember the ILOVEYOU virus,,one of the very great worldwide viruses that came.,I was very fortunate when the ILOVEYOU virus came out,,because the first person I received it from,was an ex-girlfriend of mine.,Now, she harbored all sorts of sentiments and emotions towards me at the time,,but love was not amongst them.,(Laughter),And so as soon as I saw this drop into my inbox,,I dispatched it hastily to the recycle bin,and spared myself a very nasty infection. 
 So, cybercrime, do watch out for it.,One thing that we do know that the Internet is doing,is the Internet is assisting these guys.,These are mosquitos who carry the malarial parasite,which infests our blood when the mosy has had a free meal,at our expense. 
 Now, Artesunate is a very effective drug,at destroying the parasite in the early days,of infection.,But over the past year or so,,researchers in Cambodia have discovered,that what's happening is,the malarial parasite is developing a resistance.,And they fear that the reason why it's developing a resistance,is because Cambodians can't afford the drugs on the commercial market,,and so they buy it from the Internet.,And these pills contain only low doses,of the active ingredient.,Which is why,the parasite is beginning to develop a resistance. 
 The reason I say this,is because we have to know,that organized crime,impacts all sorts of areas of our lives.,You don't have to sleep with prostitutes,or take drugs,in order to have a relationship with organized crime.,They affect our bank accounts.,They affect our communications, our pension funds.,They even affect the food that we eat,and our governments. 
 This is no longer an issue,of Sicilians from Palermo and New York.,There is no romance involved with gangsters,in the 21st Century.,This is a mighty industry,,and it creates instability and violence,wherever it goes.,It is a major economic force,and we need to take it very, very seriously.,It's been a privilege talking to you.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)Do we live in a borderless world?,Before you answer that, have a look at this map.,Contemporary political map shows,that we have over 200 countries in the world today.,That's probably more than at any time in centuries.,Now, many of you will object.,For you this would be a more appropriate map.,You could call it TEDistan.,In TEDistan, there are no borders,,just connected spaces and unconnected spaces.,Most of you probably reside in one of the 40 dots,on this screen, of the many more,that represent 90 percent of the world economy. 
 But let's talk about the 90 percent of the world population,that will never leave the place in which they were born.,For them, nations, countries, boundaries, borders still matter a great deal,,and often violently.,Now here at TED, we're solving some of the great,riddles of science and mysteries of the universe.,Well here is a fundamental problem we have not solved:,our basic political geography.,How do we distribute ourselves around the world? 
 Now this is important, because border conflicts,justify so much of the world's military-industrial complex.,Border conflicts can derail,so much of the progress that we hope to achieve here.,So I think we need a deeper understanding,of how people, money, power,,religion, culture, technology,interact to change the map of the world.,And we can try to anticipate those changes,,and shape them in a more constructive direction. 
 So we're going to look at some maps of the past,,the present and some maps you haven't seen,in order to get a sense of where things are going.,Let's start with the world of 1945.,1945 there were just 100 countries in the world.,After World War II, Europe was devastated,,but still held large overseas colonies:,French West Africa, British East Africa, South Asia, and so forth.,Then over the late '40s,,'50s, '60s, '70s and '80s,,waves of decolonization took place.,Over 50 new countries were born.,You can see that Africa has been fragmented.,India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, South East Asian nations created.,Then came the end of the Cold War.,The end of the Cold War and the disintegration of the Soviet Union.,You had the creation of new states in Eastern Europe,,the former Yugoslav republics and the Balkans,,and the 'stans of central Asia. 
 Today we have 200 countries in the world.,The entire planet is covered,by sovereign, independent nation-states.,Does that mean that someone's gain has to be someone else's loss?,Let's zoom in on one of the most strategic areas of the world,,Eastern Eurasia.,As you can see on this map,,Russia is still the largest country in the world.,And as you know, China is the most populous.,And they share a lengthy land border. 
 What you don't see on this map,is that most of Russia's 150 million people,are concentrated in its western provinces,and areas that are close to Europe.,And only 30 million people are in its eastern areas.,In fact, the World Bank predicts,that Russia's population is declining,towards about 120 million people 
 And there is another thing that you don't see on this map.,Stalin, Khrushchev and other Soviet leaders,forced Russians out to the far east,to be in gulags, labor camps,,nuclear cities, whatever the case was.,But as oil prices rose,,Russian governments have invested in infrastructure,to unite the country, east and west.,But nothing has more perversely impacted,Russia's demographic distribution,,because the people in the east, who never wanted to be there anyway,,have gotten on those trains and roads,and gone back to the west.,As a result, in the Russian far east today,,which is twice the size of India,,you have exactly six million Russians. 
 So let's get a sense of what is happening in this part of the world.,We can start with Mongolia, or as some call it, Mine-golia.,Why do they call it that?,Because in Mine-golia, Chinese firms operate,and own most of the mines -- copper, zinc, gold --,and they truck the resources south and east into mainland China.,China isn't conquering Mongolia.,It's buying it.,Colonies were once conquered. Today countries are bought. 
 So let's apply this principle to Siberia.,Siberia most of you probably think of,as a cold, desolate, unlivable place.,But in fact, with global warming and rising temperatures,,all of a sudden you have vast wheat fields,and agribusiness, and grain being produced in Siberia.,But who is it going to feed?,Well, just on the other side of the Amo River,,in the Heilongjiang and Harbin provinces of China,,you have over 100 million people.,That's larger than the entire population of Russia. 
 Every single year, for at least a decade or more,,[60,000] of them have been voting with their feet,,crossing, moving north and inhabiting this desolate terrain.,They set up their own bazaars and medical clinics.,They've taken over the timber industry,and been shipping the lumber east, back into China.,Again, like Mongolia,,China isn't conquering Russia. It's just leasing it.,That's what I call globalization Chinese style. 
 Now maybe this is what the map of the region,might look like in 10 to 20 years.,But hold on. This map is 700 years old.,This is the map of the Yuan Dynasty,,led by Kublai Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan.,So history doesn't necessarily repeat itself,,but it does rhyme. 
 This is just to give you a taste of what's happening in this part of the world.,Again, globalization Chinese style.,Because globalization opens up all kinds of ways for us to,undermine and change the way we think about political geography.,So, the history of East Asia in fact,,people don't think about nations and borders.,They think more in terms of empires and hierarchies,,usually Chinese or Japanese. 
 Well it's China's turn again.,So let's look at how China is re-establishing,that hierarchy in the far East.,It starts with the global hubs.,Remember the 40 dots on the nighttime map,that show the hubs of the global economy?,East Asia today has more of those global hubs,than any other region in the world.,Tokyo, Seoul, Beijing, Shanghai,,Hong Kong, Singapore and Sidney.,These are the filters and funnels of global capital.,Trillions of dollars a year are being brought into the region,,so much of it being invested into China. 
 Then there is trade.,These vectors and arrows represent ever stronger,trade relationships that China has,with every country in the region.,Specifically, it targets Japan,and Korea and Australia,,countries that are strong allies of the United States.,Australia, for example, is heavily dependent,on exporting iron ore and natural gas to China.,For poorer countries, China reduces tariffs,so that Laos and Cambodia can sell their goods more cheaply,and become dependent on exporting to China as well. 
 And now many of you have been reading in the news,how people are looking to China,to lead the rebound, the economic rebound, not just in Asia, but potentially for the world.,The Asian free trade zone, almost free trade zone, that's emerging,now has a greater trade volume than trade across the Pacific.,So China is becoming the anchor of the economy in the region. 
 Another pillar of this strategy is diplomacy.,China has signed military agreements with many countries in the region.,It has become the hub of diplomatic institutions,such as the East Asian Community.,Some of these organizations don't even have,the United States as a member.,There is a treaty of nonaggression between countries,,such that if there were a conflict between China and the United States,,most countries vow to just sit it out,,including American allies like Korea and Australia. 
 Another pillar of the strategy,,like Russia, is demographic.,China exports business people, nannies, students,,teachers to teach Chinese around the region,,to intermarry and to occupy ever greater,commanding heights of the economies.,Already ethnic Chinese people,in Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia,are the real key factors and drivers,in the economies there.,Chinese pride is resurgent in the region,as a result.,Singapore, for example, used to ban Chinese language education.,Now it encourages it. 
 If you add it all up what do you get?,Well, if you remember before World War II,,Japan had a vision,for a greater Japanese co-prosperity sphere.,What's emerging today is what you might call,a greater Chinese co-prosperity sphere.,So no matter what the lines on the map tell you,in terms of nations and borders,,what you really have emerging in the far east,are national cultures,,but in a much more fluid, imperial zone.,All of this is happening without firing a shot. 
 That's most certainly not the case in the Middle East,where countries are still very uncomfortable,in the borders left behind by European colonialists.,So what can we do to think about borders differently in this part of the world?,What lines on the map should we focus on?,What I want to present to you is what I call,state building, day by day. 
 Let's start with Iraq.,Six years after the U.S. invasion of Iraq,,the country still exists more on a map than it does in reality.,Oil used to be one of the forces holding Iraq together;,now it is the most significant cause of the country's disintegration.,The reason is Kurdistan.,The Kurds for 3,000 years,have been waging a struggle for independence,,and now is their chance to finally have it.,These are pipeline routes, which emerge from Kurdistan,,which is an oil-rich region. 
 And today, if you go to Kurdistan,,you'll see that Kurdish Peshmerga guerillas,are squaring off against the Sunni Iraqi army.,But what are they guarding?,Is it really a border on the map?,No. It's the pipelines.,If the Kurds can control their pipelines, they can set the terms,of their own statehood.,Now should we be upset about this, about the potential disintegration of Iraq?,I don't believe we should.,Iraq will still be the second largest oil producer in the world,,behind Saudi Arabia.,And we'll have a chance to solve a 3,000 year old dispute.,Now remember Kurdistan is landlocked.,It has no choice but to behave.,In order to profit from its oil,it has to export it through Turkey or Syria,,and other countries, and Iraq itself.,And therefore it has to have amicable relations with them. 
 Now lets look at a perennial conflict in the region.,That is, of course, in Palestine.,Palestine is something of a cartographic anomaly,because it's two parts Palestinian, one part Israel.,30 years of rose garden diplomacy,have not delivered us peace in this conflict.,What might? I believe that what might,solve the problem is infrastructure.,Today donors are spending billions of dollars on this.,These two arrows are an arc,,an arc of commuter railroads and other infrastructure,that link the West Bank and Gaza. 
 If Gaza can have a functioning port,and be linked to the West Bank, you can have a viable Palestinian state,,Palestinian economy.,That, I believe, is going to bring peace to this particular conflict.,The lesson from Kurdistan and from Palestine,is that independence alone, without infrastructure,,is futile. 
 Now what might this entire region look like,if in fact we focus on other lines on the map besides borders,,when the insecurities might abate?,The last time that was the case was actually,a century ago, during the Ottoman Empire.,This is the Hejaz Railway.,The Hejaz Railway ran from Istanbul to Medina via Damascus.,It even had an offshoot running to Haifa,in what is today Israel, on the Mediterranean Sea.,But today the Hejaz Railway lies in tatters, ruins.,If we were to focus on reconstructing these curvy lines on the map,,infrastructure, that cross the straight lines, the borders,,I believe the Middle East would be a far more peaceful region. 
 Now let's look at another part of the world,,the former Soviet Republics of Central Asia, the 'stans.,These countries' borders originate from Stalin's decrees.,He purposely did not want these countries to make sense.,He wanted ethnicities to mingle,in ways that would allow him to divide and rule.,Fortunately for them, most of their oil and gas resources,were discovered after the Soviet Union collapsed. 
 Now I know some of you may be thinking, "Oil, oil, oil.,Why is it all he's talking about is oil?",Well, there is a big difference in the way we used to talk about oil,and the way we're talking about it now.,Before it was, how do we control their oil?,Now it's their oil for their own purposes.,And I assure you it's every bit as important to them,as it might have been to colonizers and imperialists.,Here are just some of the pipeline projections,and possibilities and scenarios,and routes that are being mapped out for the next several decades.,A great deal of them. 
 For a number of countries in this part of the world,,having pipelines is the ticket to becoming part of the global economy,and for having some meaning,besides the borders that they are not loyal to themselves.,Just take Azerbaijan.,Azerbaijan was a forgotten corner of the Caucuses,,but now with the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline into Turkey,,it has rebranded itself as the frontier of the west. 
 Then there is Turkmenistan, which most people think of,as a frozen basket case.,But now it's contributing gas across the Caspian Sea,to provide for Europe,,and even a potentially Turkmen-,Afghan-Pakistan-India pipeline as well. 
 Then there is Kazakhstan, which didn't even have a name before.,It was more considered South Siberia during the Soviet Union.,Today most people recognize Kazakhstan,as an emerging geopolitical player. Why?,Because it has shrewdly designed pipelines to flow across the Caspian,,north through Russia, and even east to China.,More pipelines means more silk roads, instead of the Great Game.,The Great Game connotes dominance of one over the other.,Silk road connotes independence and mutual trust.,The more pipelines we have, the more silk roads we'll have,,and the less of a dominant Great Game competition,we'll have in the 21st century. 
 Now let's look at the only part of the world that really has brought down its borders,,and how that has enhanced its strength.,And that is, of course, Europe.,The European Union began as just the coal and steel community of six countries,,and their main purpose was really to keep the rehabilitation of Germany,to happen in a peaceful way.,But then eventually it grew into 12 countries,,and those are the 12 stars on the European flag.,The E.U. also became a currency block,,and is now the most powerful trade block in the entire world.,On average, the E.U. has grown by one country per year,since the end of the Cold War.,In fact most of that happened on just one day.,In 2004, 15 new countries joined the E.U.,and now you have what most people consider,a zone of peace spanning 27 countries,and 450 million people. 
 So what is next? What is the future of the European Union?,Well in light blue, you see the zones,or the regions that are at least two-thirds,or more dependent on the European Union,for trade and investment.,What does that tell us? Trade and investment tell us,that Europe is putting its money where its mouth is.,Even if these regions aren't part of the E.U.,,they are becoming part of its sphere of influence.,Just take the Balkans. Croatia, Serbia,Bosnia, they're not members of the E.U. yet.,But you can get on a German ICE train,and make it almost to Albania.,In Bosnia you use the Euro currency already,,and that's the only currency they're probably ever going to have. 
 So, looking at other parts of Europe's periphery, such as North Africa.,On average, every year or two,,a new oil or gas pipeline opens up under the Mediterranean,,connecting North Africa to Europe.,That not only helps Europe diminish its reliance,on Russia for energy,,but if you travel to North Africa today, you'll hear more and more people saying,that they don't really think of their region as the Middle East.,So in other words, I believe that President Sarkozy of France,is right when he talks about a Mediterranean union. 
 Now let's look at Turkey and the Caucasus.,I mentioned Azerbaijan before.,That corridor of Turkey and the Caucasus,has become the conduit for 20 percent,of Europe's energy supply.,So does Turkey really have to be a member of the European Union?,I don't think it does. I think it's already part of,a Euro-Turkish superpower. 
 So what's next? Where are we going to see borders change,and new countries born?,Well, South Central Asia, South West Asia,is a very good place to start.,Eight years after the U.S. invaded Afghanistan,there is still a tremendous amount of instability.,Pakistan and Afghanistan are still so fragile,that neither of them have dealt constructively,with the problem of Pashtun nationalism.,This is the flag that flies in the minds,of 20 million Pashtuns,who live on both sides of the Afghan and Pakistan border. 
 Let's not neglect the insurgency just to the south,,Balochistan. Two weeks ago,,Balochi rebels attacked a Pakistani military garrison,,and this was the flag that they raised over it.,The post-colonial entropy,that is happening around the world is accelerating,,and I expect more such changes to occur in the map,as the states fragment. 
 Of course, we can't forget Africa.,53 countries, and by far the most number,of suspiciously straight lines on the map.,If we were to look at all of Africa,we could most certainly acknowledge far more,,tribal divisions and so forth.,But let's just look at Sudan, the second-largest country in Africa.,It has three ongoing civil wars,,the genocide in Darfur, which you all know about,,the civil war in the east of the country,,and south Sudan.,South Sudan is going to be having a referendum in 2011,in which it is very likely to vote itself independence. 
 Now let's go up to the Arctic Circle.,There is a great race on for energy resources,under the Arctic seabed.,Who will win? Canada? Russia? The United States?,Actually Greenland.,Several weeks ago Greenland's [60,000] people,voted themselves self-governance rights,from Denmark.,So Denmark is about to get a whole lot smaller. 
 What is the lesson from all of this?,Geopolitics is a very unsentimental discipline.,It's constantly morphing and changing the world,,like climate change.,And like our relationship with the ecosystem,we're always searching for equilibrium,in how we divide ourselves across the planet.,Now we fear changes on the map.,We fear civil wars, death tolls,,having to learn the names of new countries.,But I believe that the inertia of the existing borders that we have today,is far worse and far more violent. 
 The question is how do we change those borders,,and what lines do we focus on?,I believe we focus on the lines that cross borders,,the infrastructure lines.,Then we'll wind up with the world we want, a borderless one.,Thank you.,(Applause)This is my first time at TED. Normally, as an advertising man,,I actually speak at TED Evil, which is TED's secret sister,that pays all the bills.,It's held every two years in Burma.,And I particularly remember a really good speech,by Kim Jong Il on how to get teens smoking again.,(Laughter) 
 But, actually, it's suddenly come to me after years working in the business,,that what we create in advertising,,which is intangible value -- you might call it perceived value,,you might call it badge value, subjective value,,intangible value of some kind --,gets rather a bad rap.,If you think about it, if you want to live in a world in the future,where there are fewer material goods, you basically have two choices.,You can either live in a world which is poorer,,which people in general don't like.,Or you can live in a world where actually intangible value,constitutes a greater part of overall value,,that actually intangible value, in many ways,is a very, very fine substitute,for using up labor or limited resources,in the creation of things. 
 Here is one example. This is a train which goes from London to Paris.,The question was given to a bunch of engineers,,about 15 years ago, "How do we make the journey to Paris better?",And they came up with a very good engineering solution,,which was to spend six billion pounds,building completely new tracks,from London to the coast,,and knocking about 40 minutes off a three-and-half-hour journey time.,Now, call me Mister Picky. I'm just an ad man ...,... but it strikes me as a slightly unimaginative way of improving a train journey,merely to make it shorter.,Now what is the hedonic opportunity cost,on spending six billion pounds on those railway tracks? 
 Here is my naive advertising man's suggestion.,What you should in fact do is employ all of the world's top male,and female supermodels,,pay them to walk the length of the train, handing out free Chateau Petrus,for the entire duration of the journey.,(Laughter),(Applause),Now, you'll still have about three billion pounds left in change,,and people will ask for the trains to be slowed down.,(Laughter) 
 Now, here is another naive advertising man's question again.,And this shows that engineers,,medical people, scientific people,,have an obsession with solving the problems of reality,,when actually most problems, once you reach a basic level of wealth,in society, most problems are actually problems of perception.,So I'll ask you another question.,What on earth is wrong with placebos?,They seem fantastic to me. They cost very little to develop.,They work extraordinarily well.,They have no side effects,,or if they do, they're imaginary, so you can safely ignore them.,(Laughter) 
 So I was discussing this. And I actually went to the Marginal Revolution blog,by Tyler Cowen. I don't know if anybody knows it.,Someone was actually suggesting that you can take this concept further,,and actually produce placebo education.,The point is that education doesn't actually work by teaching you things.,It actually works by giving you the impression,that you've had a very good education, which gives you an insane sense,of unwarranted self-confidence,,which then makes you very, very successful in later life.,So, welcome to Oxford, ladies and gentlemen.,(Laughter),(Applause) 
 But, actually, the point of placebo education is interesting.,How many problems of life can be solved,actually by tinkering with perception,,rather than that tedious, hardworking and messy business,of actually trying to change reality?,Here's a great example from history. I've heard this attributed to several other kings,,but doing a bit of historical research,,it seems to be Fredrick the Great.,Fredrick the Great of Prussia was very, very keen,for the Germans to adopt the potato and to eat it,,because he realized that if you had two sources of carbohydrate,,wheat and potatoes, you get less price volatility in bread.,And you get a far lower risk of famine,,because you actually had two crops to fall back on, not one. 
 The only problem is: potatoes, if you think about it, look pretty disgusting.,And also, 18th century Prussians ate very, very few vegetables --,rather like contemporary Scottish people.,(Laughter),So, actually, he tried making it compulsory.,The Prussian peasantry said,,"We can't even get the dogs to eat these damn things.,They are absolutely disgusting and they're good for nothing.",There are even records of people being executed,for refusing to grow potatoes. 
 So he tried plan B.,He tried the marketing solution, which is he declared the potato,as a royal vegetable, and none but the royal family could consume it.,And he planted it in a royal potato patch,,with guards who had instructions,to guard over it, night and day,,but with secret instructions not to guard it very well.,(Laughter),Now, 18th century peasants know that there is one,pretty safe rule in life, which is if something is worth guarding,,it's worth stealing.,Before long, there was a massive underground,potato-growing operation in Germany.,What he'd effectively done is he'd re-branded the potato.,It was an absolute masterpiece. 
 I told this story and a gentleman from Turkey came up to me and said,,"Very, very good marketer, Fredrick the Great. But not a patch on Ataturk.",Ataturk, rather like Nicolas Sarkozy,,was very keen to discourage the wearing of a veil,,in Turkey, to modernize it.,Now, boring people would have just simply banned the veil.,But that would have ended up with a lot of awful kickback,and a hell of a lot of resistance.,Ataturk was a lateral thinker.,He made it compulsory for prostitutes to wear the veil.,(Laughter),(Applause) 
 I can't verify that fully, but it does not matter.,There is your environmental problem solved, by the way, guys:,All convicted child molesters,have to drive a Porsche Cayenne.,(Laughter),What Ataturk realized actually is two very fundamental things.,Which is that, actually, first one,,all value is actually relative.,All value is perceived value. 
 For those of you who don't speak Spanish, jugo de naranja -- it's actually the Spanish for "orange juice.",Because actually it's not the dollar. It's actually the peso,in Buenos Aires. Very clever Buenos Aires street vendors,decided to practice price discrimination,to the detriment of any passing gringo tourists.,As an advertising man, I have to admire that. 
 But the first thing is that all value is subjective.,Second point is that persuasion is often better than compulsion.,These funny signs that flash your speed at you,,some of the new ones, on the bottom right,,now actually show a smiley face or a frowny face,,to act as an emotional trigger.,What's fascinating about these signs is they cost about 10 percent,of the running cost of a conventional speed camera,,but they prevent twice as many accidents.,So, the bizarre thing, which is baffling,to conventional, classically trained economists,,is that a weird little smiley face,has a better effect on changing your behavior,than the threat of a £60 fine and three penalty points. 
 Tiny little behavioral economics detail:,in Italy, penalty points go backwards.,You start with 12 and they take them away.,Because they found that loss aversion,is a more powerful influence on people's behavior.,In Britain we tend to feel, "Whoa! Got another three!",Not so in Italy. 
 Another fantastic case of creating intangible value,to replace actual or material value, which remember, is what,,after all, the environmental movement needs to be about:,This again is from Prussia, from, I think, about 1812, 1813.,The wealthy Prussians, to help in the war against the French,,were encouraged to give in all their jewelry.,And it was replaced with replica jewelry,made of cast iron.,Here's one: "Gold gab ich für Eisen, 1813.",The interesting thing is that for 50 years hence,,the highest status jewelry you could wear in Prussia,wasn't made of gold or diamonds.,It was made of cast iron.,Because actually, never mind the actual intrinsic value,of having gold jewelry. This actually,had symbolic value, badge value.,It said that your family had made a great sacrifice in the past. 
 So, the modern equivalent would of course be this.,(Laughter),But, actually, there is a thing, just as there are Veblen goods,,where the value of the good depends on it being expensive and rare --,there are opposite kind of things,where actually the value in them depends on them being,ubiquitous, classless and minimalistic. 
 If you think about it, Shakerism was a proto-environmental movement.,Adam Smith talks about 18th century America,,where the prohibition against visible displays of wealth was so great,,it was almost a block in the economy in New England,,because even wealthy farmers could find nothing to spend their money on,without incurring the displeasure of their neighbors.,It's perfectly possible to create these social pressures,which lead to more egalitarian societies. 
 What's also interesting, if you look at products,that have a high component,of what you might call messaging value,,a high component of intangible value, versus their intrinsic value:,They are often quite egalitarian.,In terms of dress, denim is perhaps the perfect example of something,which replaces material value with symbolic value.,Coca-Cola. A bunch of you may be a load of pinkos,,and you may not like the Coca-Cola company,,but it's worth remembering Andy Warhol's point about Coke.,What Warhol said about Coke is, he said,,"What I really like about Coca-Cola is the president of the United States,can't get a better Coke than the bum on the corner of the street.",Now, that is, actually, when you think about it -- we take it for granted --,it's actually a remarkable achievement,,to produce something that's that democratic. 
 Now, we basically have to change our views slightly.,There is a basic view that real value involves making things,,involves labor. It involves engineering.,It involves limited raw materials.,And that what we add on top is kind of false. It's a fake version.,And there is a reason for some suspicion and uncertainly about it.,It patently veers toward propaganda.,However, what we do have now,is a much more variegated media ecosystem,in which to kind of create this kind of value, and it's much fairer. 
 When I grew up, this was basically the media environment of my childhood,as translated into food.,You had a monopoly supplier. On the left,,you have Rupert Murdoch, or the BBC.,(Laughter),And on your right you have a dependent public,which is pathetically grateful for anything you give it.,(Laughter) 
 Nowadays, the user is actually involved.,This is actually what's called, in the digital world, "user-generated content.",Although it's called agriculture in the world of food.,(Laughter),This is actually called a mash-up,,where you take content that someone else has produced,and you do something new with it.,In the world of food we call it cooking.,This is food 2.0,,which is food you produce for the purpose of sharing it with other people.,This is mobile food. British are very good at that.,Fish and chips in newspaper, the Cornish Pasty,,the pie, the sandwich.,We invented the whole lot of them.,We're not very good at food in general. Italians do great food,,but it's not very portable, generally.,(Laughter) 
 I only learned this the other day. The Earl of Sandwich didn't invent the sandwich.,He actually invented the toasty. But then, the Earl of Toasty would be a ridiculous name.,(Laughter) 
 Finally, we have contextual communication.,Now, the reason I show you Pernod -- it's only one example.,Every country has a contextual alcoholic drink. In France it's Pernod.,It tastes great within the borders of that country,,but absolute shite if you take it anywhere else.,(Laughter),Unicum in Hungary, for example.,The Greeks have actually managed to produce something called Retsina,,which even tastes shite when you're in Greece.,(Laughter) 
 But so much communication now is contextual,that the capacity for actually nudging people,,for giving them better information -- B.J. Fogg,,at the University of Stanford, makes the point,that actually the mobile phone is --,He's invented the phrase, "persuasive technologies.",He believes the mobile phone, by being location-specific,,contextual, timely and immediate,,is simply the greatest persuasive technology device ever invented. 
 Now, if we have all these tools at our disposal,,we simply have to ask the question,,and Thaler and Sunstein have, of how we can use these more intelligently.,I'll give you one example.,If you had a large red button of this kind, on the wall of your home,,and every time you pressed it, it saved 50 dollars for you,,put 50 dollars into your pension,,you would save a lot more.,The reason is that the interface fundamentally determines,the behavior. Okay? 
 Now, marketing has done a very, very good job of creating,opportunities for impulse buying.,Yet we've never created the opportunity for impulse saving.,If you did this, more people would save more.,It's simply a question of changing the interface,by which people make decisions,,and the very nature of the decisions changes.,Obviously, I don't want people to do this,,because as an advertising man I tend to regard saving as just,consumerism needlessly postponed.,(Laughter),But if anybody did want to do that,,that's the kind of thing we need to be thinking about, actually:,fundamental opportunities to change human behavior. 
 Now, I've got an example here from Canada.,There was a young intern at Ogilvy Canada,called Hunter Somerville,,who was working in improv in Toronto,,and got a part-time job in advertising,,and was given the job of advertising Shreddies.,Now this is the most perfect case of creating,intangible, added value,,without changing the product in the slightest.,Shreddies is a strange, square, whole-grain cereal,,only available in New Zealand, Canada and Britain.,It's Kraft's peculiar way of rewarding loyalty to the crown.,(Laughter),In working out how you could re-launch Shreddies,,he came up with this. 
 Video: (Buzzer),Man: Shreddies is supposed to be square.,(Laughter) 
 Woman: Have any of these diamond shapes gone out?,(Laughter) 
 Voiceover: New Diamond Shreddies cereal.,Same 100 percent whole-grain wheat in a delicious diamond shape.,(Applause) 
 Rory Sutherland: I'm not sure this isn't the most perfect example,of intangible value creation. All it requires is,photons, neurons, and a great idea to create this thing.,I would say it's a work of genius.,But, naturally, you can't do this kind of thing without a little bit of market research. 
 Man: So, Shreddies is actually producing a new product,,which is something very exciting for them.,So they are introducing new Diamond Shreddies.,(Laughter),So I just want to get your first impressions when you see that,,when you see the Diamond Shreddies box there.,(Laughter) 
 Woman: Weren't they square? 
 Woman #2: I'm a little bit confused. Woman #3: They look like the squares to me. 
 Man: They -- Yeah, it's all in the appearance.,But it's kind of like flipping a six or a nine. Like a six,,if you flip it over it looks like a nine.,But a six is very different from a nine. 
 Woman # 3: Or an "M" and a "W". Man: An "M" and a "W", exactly. 
 Man #2: [unclear],You just looked like you turned it on its end. But when you see it like that,it's more interesting looking. 
 Man: Just try both of them.,Take a square one there, first.,(Laughter),Man: Which one did you prefer? Man #2: The first one. 
 Man: The first one?,(Laughter) 
 Rory Sutherland: Now, naturally, a debate raged.,There were conservative elements in Canada, unsurprisingly,,who actually resented this intrusion.,So, eventually, the manufacturers actually,arrived at a compromise, which was the combo pack.,(Laughter),(Applause),(Laughter) 
 If you think it's funny, bear in mind there is an organization called,the American Institute of Wine Economics,,which actually does extensive research into perception of things,,and discovers that except for among,perhaps five or ten percent of the most knowledgeable people,,there is no correlation between quality and enjoyment,in wine,,except when you tell the people how expensive it is,,in which case they tend to enjoy the more expensive stuff more.,So drink your wine blind in the future. 
 But this is both hysterically funny --,but I think an important philosophical point,,which is, going forward, we need more of this kind of value.,We need to spend more time appreciating what already exists,,and less time agonizing over what else we can do. 
 Two quotations to more or less end with.,One of them is, "Poetry is when you make new things,familiar and familiar things new.",Which isn't a bad definition of what our job is,,to help people appreciate what is unfamiliar, but also,to gain a greater appreciation, and place a far higher value on,those things which are already existing.,There is some evidence, by the way, that things like social networking help do that.,Because they help people share news.,They give badge value to everyday little trivial activities.,So they actually reduce the need for actually spending great money on display,,and increase the kind of third-party,enjoyment you can get from the smallest, simplest things in life. Which is magic. 
 The second one is the second G.K. Chesterton quote of this session,,which is, "We are perishing for want of wonder, not for want of wonders,",which I think for anybody involved in technology, is perfectly true.,And a final thing: When you place a value on things like health,,love, sex and other things,,and learn to place a material value,on what you've previously discounted,for being merely intangible, a thing not seen,,you realize you're much, much wealthier than you ever imagined.,Thank you very much indeed.,(Applause)I run a design studio in New York.,Every seven years, I close it for one year,to pursue,some little experiments, things that,are always difficult to accomplish,during the regular working year.,In that year, we are not available,for any of our clients.,We are totally closed.,And as you can imagine,,it is a lovely and very energetic time. 
 I originally had opened the studio in New York,to combine my two loves, music and design.,And we created videos and packaging,for many musicians that you know,,and for even more that you've never heard of.,As I realized, just like with many many things in my life,that I actually love,,I adapt to it.,And I get, over time, bored by them.,And for sure, in our case,,our work started to look the same.,You see here a glass eye in a die cut of a book.,Quite the similar idea, then, a perfume packaged,in a book, in a die cut.,So I decided to close it down for one year. 
 Also is the knowledge that,right now we spend about,in the first 25 years of our lives learning,,then there is another 40 years,that's really reserved for working.,And then tacked on at the end of it,are about 15 years for retirement.,And I thought it might be helpful,to basically cut off five of those retirement years,and intersperse them in between those working years.,(Applause),That's clearly enjoyable for myself.,But probably even more important is,that the work that comes out of these years,flows back into the company,and into society at large,,rather than just benefiting a grandchild or two. 
 There is a fellow TEDster who spoke two years ago,,Jonathan Haidt,,who defined his work into three different levels.,And they rang very true for me.,I can see my work as a job. I do it for money.,I likely already look forward to the weekend on Thursdays.,And I probably will need a hobby as a leveling mechanism.,In a career I'm definitely more engaged.,But at the same time, there will be periods when I think,is all that really hard work really worth my while?,While in the third one, in the calling,,very much likely I would do it also,if I wouldn't be financially compensated for it. 
 I am not a religious person myself,,but I did look for nature.,I had spent my first sabbatical in New York City.,Looked for something different for the second one.,Europe and the U.S. didn't really feel enticing,because I knew them too well. So Asia it was.,The most beautiful landscapes I had seen in Asia,were Sri Lanka and Bali.,Sri Lanka still had the civil war going on, so Bali it was.,It's a wonderful, very craft-oriented society. 
 I arrived there in September 2008,,and pretty much started to work right away.,There is wonderful inspiration coming from the area itself.,However the first thing that I needed was,mosquito repellent typography,because they were definitely around heavily.,And then I needed some sort of way,to be able to get back to all the wild dogs,that surround my house,,and attacked me during my morning walks.,So we created this series of 99 portraits on tee shirts.,Every single dog on one tee shirt.,As a little retaliation,with a just ever so slightly menacing message,(Laughter),on the back of the shirt.,(Laughter) 
 Just before I left New York,I decided I could actually renovate my studio.,And then just leave it all to them.,And I don't have to do anything.,So I looked for furniture.,And it turned out that,all the furniture that I really liked,,I couldn't afford.,And all the stuff I could afford, I didn't like.,So one of the things that we pursued in Bali,was pieces of furniture.,This one, of course, still works with the wild dogs.,It's not quite finished yet.,And I think by the time this lamp came about,,(Laughter),I had finally made peace with those dogs.,(Laughter) 
 Then there is a coffee table. I also did a coffee table.,It's called Be Here Now.,It includes 330 compasses.,And we had custom espresso cups made,that hide a magnet inside,,and make those compasses go crazy,,always centering on them.,Then this is a fairly talkative, verbose kind of chair.,I also started meditating for the first time in my life in Bali.,And at the same time, I'm extremely aware,how boring it is to hear about other people's happinesses.,So I will not really go too far into it. 
 Many of you will know this TEDster,,Danny Gilbert, whose book, actually,,I got it through the TED book club.,I think it took me four years,to finally read it, while on sabbatical.,And I was pleased to see,that he actually wrote the book while he was on sabbatical.,And I'll show you a couple of people,that did well by pursuing sabbaticals. 
 This is Ferran Adria. Many people think,he is right now the best chef in the world,with his restaurant north of Barcelona, El Bulli.,His restaurant is open seven months every year.,He closes it down for five months,to experiment with a full kitchen staff.,His latest numbers are fairly impressive.,He can seat, throughout the year,,he can seat 8,000 people.,And he has 2.2 million requests for reservations. 
 If I look at my cycle, seven years, one year sabbatical,,it's 12.5 percent of my time.,And if I look at companies that are actually more successful than mine,,3M since the 1930s,is giving all their engineers,15 percent to pursue whatever they want.,There is some good successes.,Scotch tape came out of this program,,as well as Art Fry developed,sticky notes from during his personal time for 3M.,Google, of course, very famously,gives 20 percent for their software engineers,to pursue their own personal projects. 
 Anybody in here has actually ever conducted a sabbatical?,That's about five percent of everybody.,So I'm not sure if you saw your neighbor putting their hand up.,Talk to them about if it was successful or not.,I've found that,finding out about what I'm going to like in the future,,my very best way is to talk to people,who have actually done it,much better than myself envisioning it. 
 When I had the idea of doing one,,the process was I made the decision and I put it into my daily planner book.,And then I told as many, many people as I possibly could about it,so that there was no way that I could chicken out later on.,(Laughter) 
 In the beginning, on the first sabbatical,,it was rather disastrous.,I had thought that I should do this without any plan,,that this vacuum of time somehow would,be wonderful and enticing,for idea generation. It was not.,I just, without a plan, I just reacted,to little requests, not work requests,,those I all said no to, but other little requests.,Sending mail to Japanese design magazines and things like that.,So I became my own intern.,(Laughter) 
 And I very quickly,made a list of the things I was interested in,,put them in a hierarchy, divided them into chunks of time,and then made a plan, very much like in grade school.,What does it say here? Monday, 8 to 9: story writing;,9 to 10: future thinking.,Was not very successful. And so on and so forth.,And that actually, specifically as a starting point,of the first sabbatical, worked really well for me.,What came out of it?,I really got close to design again.,I had fun.,Financially, seen over the long term, it was actually successful.,Because of the improved quality, we could ask for higher prices. 
 And probably most importantly,,basically everything we've done,in the seven years following the first sabbatical,came out of thinking of that one single year.,And I'll show you a couple of projects,that came out of the seven years following that sabbatical.,One of the strands of thinking I was involved in was,that sameness is so incredibly overrated.,This whole idea that everything needs to be exactly the same,works for a very very few strand of companies,,and not for everybody else. 
 We were asked to design an identity for Casa da Musica,,the Rem Koolhaas-built music center,in Porto, in Portugal.,And even though I desired to do an identity,that doesn't use the architecture,,I failed at that.,And mostly also because I realized,out of a Rem Koolhaas presentation to the city of Porto, where,he talked about a conglomeration of various layers of meaning.,Which I understood after I,translated it from architecture speech,in to regular English,,basically as logo making.,And I understood that the building itself was a logo. 
 So then it became quite easy.,We put a mask on it,,looked at it deep down in the ground,,checked it out from all sides,,west, north, south, east,,top and bottom.,Colored them in a very particular way,by having a friend of mine write a piece of software,,the Casa da Musica Logo Generator.,That's connected to a scanner.,You put any image in there, like that Beethoven image.,And the software, in a second,,will give you the Casa da Musica Beethoven logo.,Which, when you actually have to design a Beethoven poster,,comes in handy, because the visual information of the logo,and the actual poster is exactly the same. 
 So it will always fit together, conceptually, of course.,If Zappa's music is performed, it gets its own logo.,Or Philip Glass or Lou Reed or the Chemical Brothers,,who all performed there, get their own,Casa da Musica logo.,It works the same internally with the president or the musical director,,whose Casa da Musica portraits wind up on their business cards.,There is a full-blown orchestra,living inside the building.,It has a more transparent identity.,The truck they go on tour with.,Or there's a smaller contemporary orchestra,,12 people that remixes its own title. 
 And one of the handy things that came about,was that you could take the logo type,and create advertising out of it.,Like this Donna Toney poster,,or Chopin, or Mozart,,or La Monte Young.,You can take the shape and make typography out of it.,You can grow it underneath the skin.,You can have a poster for a family event in front of the house,,or a rave underneath the house,or a weekly program,,as well as educational services. 
 Second insight. So far, until that point I had,been mostly involved,or used the language of design,for promotional purposes,,which was fine with me.,On one hand I have nothing against selling.,My parents are both salespeople.,But I did feel that,I spent so much time learning this language,,why do I only promote with it?,There must be something else.,And the whole series of work came out of it.,Some of you might have seen it.,I showed some of it,at earlier TEDs before,,under the title "Things I've Learned in My Life So Far.",I'll just show two now. 
 This is a whole wall of bananas,at different ripenesses,on the opening day in this gallery in New York.,It says, "Self-confidence produces fine results.",This is after a week.,After two weeks,,three weeks, four weeks, five weeks.,And you see the self confidence almost comes back,,but not quite.,These are some pictures visitors sent to me.,(Laughter) 
 And then the city of Amsterdam,gave us a plaza and asked us to do something.,We used the stone plates as a grid,for our little piece.,We got 250,000 coins from the central bank,,at different darknesses.,So we got brand new ones, shiny ones,,medium ones, and very old, dark ones.,And with the help of 100 volunteers, over a week,,created this fairly floral typography,that spelled, "Obsessions make my life worse,and my work better." 
 And the idea of course was to,make the type so precious,that as an audience,you would be in between,,"Should I really take as much money as I can?,Or should I leave the piece intact as it is right now?",While we built all this up,during that week, with the 100 volunteers,,a good number of the neighbors surrounding the plaza,got very close to it and quite loved it.,So when it was finally done,,and in the first night,a guy came with big plastic bags,and scooped up as many coins as he could possibly carry,,one of the neighbors called the police. 
 And the Amsterdam police,in all their wisdom,,came, saw,,and they wanted to protect the artwork.,And they swept it all up and put it into custody,at police headquarters.,(Laughter),I think you see, you see them sweeping. You see them sweeping right here.,That's the police, getting rid of it all.,So after eight hours,that's pretty much all that was left,of the whole thing.,(Laughter) 
 We are also working on the start of a bigger project in Bali.,It's a movie about happiness.,And here we asked some nearby pigs,to do the titles for us.,They weren't quite slick enough.,So we asked the goose to do it again,,and hoped she would do somehow,,a more elegant or pretty job.,And I think she overdid it.,Just a bit too ornamental.,And my studio is very close to the monkey forest.,And the monkeys in that monkey forest,looked, actually, fairly happy.,So we asked those guys to do it again.,They did a fine job, but had,a couple of readability problems.,So of course whatever you don't really do yourself,doesn't really get done properly. 
 That film we'll be working on for the next two years.,So it's going to be a while.,And of course you might think that,doing a film on happiness,might not really be worthwhile.,Then you can of course always,go and see this guy. 
 Video: (Laughter),And I'm happy I'm alive.,I'm happy I'm alive. I'm happy I'm alive. 
 Stefan Sagmeister: Thank you.,(Applause)Okay, so,90 percent of my photographic process,is, in fact, not photographic.,It involves a campaign of letter writing,,research and phone calls,to access my subjects,,which can range from Hamas leaders in Gaza,to a hibernating black bear in its cave,in West Virginia.,And oddly, the most notable,letter of rejection I ever received,came from Walt Disney World,,a seemingly innocuous site. 
 And it read -- I'm just going to read a key sentence:,"Especially during these violent times,,I personally believe,that the magical spell cast upon guests who visit our theme parks,is particularly important to protect,and helps to provide them with an important fantasy,they can escape to." 
 Photography threatens fantasy.,They didn't want to let my camera in,because it confronts constructed realities, myths and beliefs,,and provides what appears to be,evidence of a truth.,But there are multiple truths attached to every image,,depending on the creator's intention, the viewer,and the context in which it is presented. 
 Over a five year period following September 11th,,when the American media and government were seeking,hidden and unknown sites,beyond its borders,,most notably weapons of mass destruction,,I chose to look inward at that which was integral,to America's foundation,,mythology and daily functioning.,I wanted to confront the boundaries of the citizen,,self-imposed and real,,and confront the divide between privileged,and public access to knowledge. 
 It was a critical moment in American history,and global history,where one felt they didn't have access to accurate information.,And I wanted to see the center with my own eyes,,but what I came away with is a photograph.,And it's just another place from which to observe,,and the understanding that,there are no absolute, all-knowing insiders.,And the outsider can never really reach the core. 
 I'm going to run through some of the photographs in this series.,It's titled, "An American Index,of the Hidden and Unfamiliar,",and it's comprised of nearly 70 images.,In this context I'll just show you a few.,This is a nuclear waste storage and encapsulation facility,at Hanford site in Washington State,,where there are over 1,900,stainless steel capsules containing nuclear waste,submerged in water.,A human standing in front of an unprotected capsule would die instantly.,And I found one section amongst all of these,that actually resembled the outline,of the United States of America,,which you can see here. 
 And a big part of the work that is,sort of absent in this context is text.,So I create these two poles.,Every image is accompanied with a very detailed factual text.,And what I'm most interested in,is the invisible space between a text,and its accompanying image,,and how the image is transformed by the text,and the text by the image.,So, at best, the image is meant to float away,into abstraction and multiple truths and fantasy.,And then the text functions as this cruel anchor,that kind of nails it to the ground.,But in this context I'm just going to read,an abridged version of those texts. 
 This is a cryopreservation unit,,and it holds the bodies of the wife and mother,of cryonics pioneer Robert Ettinger,,who hoped to be awoken one day to extended life,in good health, with advancements in science and technology,,all for the cost of 35 thousand dollars, for forever. 
 This is a 21-year-old Palestinian woman,undergoing hymenoplasty.,Hymenoplasty is a surgical procedure which restores the virginal state,,allowing her to adhere to certain cultural expectations,regarding virginity and marriage.,So it essentially reconstructs a ruptured hymen,,allowing her to bleed upon having sexual intercourse,,to simulate the loss of virginity. 
 This is a jury simulation deliberation room,,and you can see beyond that two-way mirror,jury advisers standing in a room behind the mirror.,And they observe deliberations,after mock trial proceedings,so that they can better advise their clients how to adjust their trial strategy,to have the outcome that they're hoping for.,This process costs 60,000 dollars. 
 This is a U.S. Customs and Border Protection room,,a contraband room, at John F. Kennedy International Airport.,On that table you can see 48 hours' worth,of seized goods from passengers entering in to the United States.,There is a pig's head and African cane rats.,And part of my photographic work,is I'm not just documenting what's there.,I do take certain liberties and intervene.,And in this I really wanted it to resemble,an early still-life painting,,so I spent some time with the smells and items. 
 This is the exhibited art on the walls of the CIA,in Langley, Virginia, their original headquarters building.,And the CIA has had a long history,with both covert and public cultural diplomacy efforts.,And it's speculated that some of their interest in the arts,was designed to counter Soviet communism,and promote what it considered to be pro-American,thoughts and aesthetics.,And one of the art forms that elicited the interest of the agency,,and had thus come under question, is abstract expressionism. 
 This is the Forensic Anthropology Research Facility,,and on a six acre plot,there are approximately 75 cadavers at any given time,that are being studied by forensic anthropologists,and researchers who are interested in monitoring,a rate of corpse decomposition.,And in this particular photograph the body of a young boy,has been used to reenact a crime scene. 
 This is the only federally funded site,where it is legal to cultivate cannabis,for scientific research in the United States.,It's a research crop marijuana grow room. 
 And part of the work that I hope for,is that there is a sort of disorienting entropy,where you can't find any discernible formula in how these things --,they sort of awkwardly jump from government to science,to religion to security --,and you can't completely understand,how information is being distributed. 
 These are transatlantic submarine communication cables,that travel across the floor of the Atlantic Ocean,,connecting North America to Europe.,They carry over 60 million simultaneous voice conversations,,and in a lot of the government and technology sites,there was just this very apparent vulnerability.,This one is almost humorous because it feels like I could,just snip all of that conversation in one easy cut.,But stuff did feel like it could have been taken,30 or 40 years ago, like it was locked in the Cold War era,and hadn't necessarily progressed. 
 This is a Braille edition of Playboy magazine.,(Laughter),And this is ... a division of the Library of Congress,produces a free national library service,for the blind and visually impaired,,and the publications they choose to publish,are based on reader popularity.,And Playboy is always in the top few.,(Laughter),But you'd be surprised, they don't do the photographs. It's just the text.,(Laughter) 
 This is an avian quarantine facility,where all imported birds coming into America,are required to undergo a 30-day quarantine,,where they are tested for diseases,including Exotic Newcastle Disease,and Avian Influenza.,This film shows,the testing of a new explosive fill on a warhead.,And the Air Armament Center,at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida,is responsible for the deployment and testing,of all air-delivered weaponry,coming from the United States.,And the film was shot on 72 millimeter, government-issue film.,And that red dot is a marking on the government-issue film. 
 All living white tigers in North America,are the result of selective inbreeding --,that would be mother to son,,father to daughter, sister to brother --,to allow for the genetic conditions,that create a salable white tiger.,Meaning white fur, ice blue eyes, a pink nose.,And the majority of these white tigers,are not born in a salable state,and are killed at birth.,It's a very violent process that is little known.,And the white tiger is obviously celebrated in several forms of entertainment.,Kenny was born. He actually made it to adulthood.,He has since passed away,,but was mentally retarded,and suffers from severe bone abnormalities. 
 This, on a lighter note, is at,George Lucas' personal archive.,This is the Death Star.,And it's shown here in its true orientation.,In the context of "Star Wars: Return of the Jedi,",its mirror image is presented.,They flip the negative.,And you can see the photoetched brass detailing,,and the painted acrylic facade.,In the context of the film,,this is a deep-space battle station of the Galactic Empire,,capable of annihilating planets and civilizations,,and in reality it measures about four feet by two feet.,(Laughter) 
 This is at Fort Campbell in Kentucky.,It's a Military Operations on Urbanized Terrain site.,Essentially they've simulated a city,for urban combat,,and this is one of the structures that exists in that city.,It's called the World Church of God.,It's supposed to be a generic site of worship.,And after I took this photograph,,they constructed a wall around the World Church of God,to mimic the set-up of mosques in Afghanistan or Iraq.,And I worked with Mehta Vihar,who creates virtual simulations for the army,for tactical practice.,And we put that wall around the World Church of God,,and also used the characters and vehicles and explosions,that are offered in the video games for the army.,And I put them into my photograph. 
 This is live HIV virus,at Harvard Medical School, who is working with the U.S. Government,to develop sterilizing immunity. 
 And Alhurra is a U.S. Government- sponsored,Arabic language television network,that distributes news and information to over 22 countries in the Arab world.,It runs 24 hours a day, commercial free.,However, it's illegal to broadcast Alhurra within the United States.,And in 2004, they developed a channel called Alhurra Iraq,,which specifically deals with events occurring in Iraq,and is broadcast to Iraq. 
 Now I'm going to move on to another project I did.,It's titled "The Innocents.",And for the men in these photographs,,photography had been used to create a fantasy.,Contradicting its function as evidence of a truth,,in these instances it furthered the fabrication of a lie.,I traveled across the United States,photographing men and women who had been wrongfully convicted,of crimes they did not commit, violent crimes. 
 I investigate photography's ability to blur truth and fiction,,and its influence on memory,,which can lead to severe, even lethal consequences.,For the men in these photographs,,the primary cause of their wrongful conviction,was mistaken identification.,A victim or eyewitness identifies,a suspected perpetrator,through law enforcement's use of images.,But through exposure to composite sketches,,Polaroids, mug shots and line-ups,,eyewitness testimony can change. 
 I'll give you an example from a case.,A woman was raped and presented with a series of photographs,from which to identify her attacker.,She saw some similarities in one of the photographs,,but couldn't quite make a positive identification.,Days later, she is presented with another photo array,of all new photographs,,except that one photograph that she had some draw to,from the earlier array is repeated in the second array.,And a positive identification is made,because the photograph replaced the memory,,if there ever was an actual memory. 
 Photography offered the criminal justice system,a tool that transformed innocent citizens into criminals,,and the criminal justice system failed to recognize the limitations,of relying on photographic identifications. 
 Frederick Daye, who is photographed at his alibi location,,where 13 witnesses placed him at the time of the crime.,He was convicted by an all-white jury,of rape, kidnapping and vehicle theft.,And he served 10 years of a life sentence.,Now DNA exonerated Frederick,and it also implicated another man,who was serving time in prison.,But the victim refused to press charges,because she claimed that law enforcement,had permanently altered her memory through the use of Frederick's photograph. 
 Charles Fain was convicted of kidnapping, rape and murder,of a young girl walking to school.,He served 18 years of a death sentence.,I photographed him at the scene of the crime,at the Snake River in Idaho.,And I photographed all of the wrongfully convicted,at sites that came to particular significance,in the history of their wrongful conviction.,The scene of arrest, the scene of misidentification,,the alibi location.,And here, the scene of the crime, it's this place,to which he's never been, but changed his life forever.,So photographing there, I was hoping to highlight,the tenuous relationship between truth and fiction,,in both his life and in photography. 
 Calvin Washington was convicted of capital murder.,He served 13 years of a life sentence in Waco, Texas. 
 Larry Mayes, I photographed at the scene of arrest,,where he hid between two mattresses in Gary, Indiana,,in this very room to hide from the police.,He ended up serving 18 and a half years,of an 80 year sentence for rape and robbery.,The victim failed to identify Larry,in two live lineups,and then made a positive identification, days later,,from a photo array. 
 Larry Youngblood served eight years of a 10 and half year sentence,in Arizona for the abduction and repeated sodomizing,of a 10 year old boy at a carnival.,He is photographed at his alibi location. 
 Ron Williamson. Ron was convicted of the rape and murder,of a barmaid at a club,,and served 11 years of a death sentence.,I photographed Ron at a baseball field,because he had been drafted to the Oakland A's,to play professional baseball just before his conviction.,And the state's key witness in Ron's case,was, in the end, the actual perpetrator. 
 Ronald Jones served eight years of a death sentence,for rape and murder of a 28-year-old woman.,I photographed him at the scene of arrest in Chicago. 
 William Gregory was convicted of rape and burglary.,He served seven years of a 70 year sentence in Kentucky. 
 Timothy Durham, who I photographed at his alibi location,where 11 witnesses placed him at the time of the crime,,was convicted of 3.5 years,of a 3220 year sentence,,for several charges of rape and robbery.,He had been misidentified by an 11-year-old victim. 
 Troy Webb is photographed here at the scene of the crime in Virginia.,He was convicted of rape, kidnapping and robbery,,and served seven years of a 47 year sentence.,Troy's picture was in a photo array,that the victim tentatively had some draw toward,,but said he looked too old.,The police went and found a photograph of Troy Webb,from four years earlier,,which they entered into a photo array days later,,and he was positively identified. 
 Now I'm going to leave you with a self portrait.,And it reiterates that distortion is a constant,,and our eyes are easily deceived.,That's it. Thank you.,(Applause)As technology progresses,,and as it advances,,many of us assume that these advances,make us more intelligent,,make us smarter and more connected to the world.,And what I'd like to argue,is that that's not necessarily the case,,as progress is simply a word for change,,and with change you gain something,,but you also lose something. 
 And to really illustrate this point, what I'd like to do,is to show you how technology has dealt with,a very simple, a very common, an everyday question.,And that question is this.,What time is it? What time is it?,If you glance at your iPhone, it's so simple to tell the time.,But, I'd like to ask you, how would you tell the time,if you didn't have an iPhone?,How would you tell the time, say, 600 years ago?,How would you do it? 
 Well, the way you would do it is by using a device,that's called an astrolabe.,So, an astrolabe is relatively unknown in today's world.,But, at the time, in the 13th century,,it was the gadget of the day.,It was the world's first popular computer.,And it was a device that, in fact, is a model of the sky.,So, the different parts of the astrolabe, in this particular type,,the rete corresponds to the positions of the stars.,The plate corresponds to a coordinate system.,And the mater has some scales and puts it all together. 
 If you were an educated child,,you would know how to not only use the astrolabe,,you would also know how to make an astrolabe.,And we know this because the first treatise on the astrolabe,,the first technical manual in the English language,,was written by Geoffrey Chaucer.,Yes, that Geoffrey Chaucer, in 1391,,to his little Lewis, his 11-year-old son.,And in this book, little Lewis would know the big idea. 
 And the central idea that makes this computer work,is this thing called stereographic projection.,And basically, the concept is,,how do you represent the three-dimensional image,of the night sky that surrounds us,onto a flat, portable, two-dimensional surface.,The idea is actually relatively simple.,Imagine that that Earth is at the center of the universe,,and surrounding it is the sky projected onto a sphere.,Each point on the surface of the sphere,is mapped through the bottom pole,,onto a flat surface, where it is then recorded. 
 So the North Star corresponds to the center of the device.,The ecliptic, which is the path of the sun, moon, and planets,correspond to an offset circle.,The bright stars correspond to little daggers on the rete.,And the altitude corresponds to the plate system.,Now, the real genius of the astrolabe is not just the projection.,The real genius is that it brings together two coordinate systems,so they fit perfectly.,There is the position of the sun, moon and planets on the movable rete.,And then there is their location on the sky,as seen from a certain latitude on the back plate. Okay? 
 So how would you use this device?,Well, let me first back up for a moment.,This is an astrolabe. Pretty impressive, isn't it?,And so, this astrolabe is on loan from us,from the Oxford School of -- Museum of History.,And you can see the different components.,This is the mater, the scales on the back.,This is the rete. Okay. Do you see that?,That's the movable part of the sky.,And in the back you can see,a spider web pattern.,And that spider web pattern corresponds to the local coordinates in the sky.,This is a rule device. And on the back,are some other devices, measuring tools,and scales, to be able to make some calculations. Okay? 
 You know, I've always wanted one of these.,For my thesis I actually built one of these out of paper.,And this one, this is a replica,from a 15th-century device.,And it's worth probably about three MacBook Pros.,But a real one would cost about as much as my house,,and the house next to it, and actually every house on the block,,on both sides of the street,,maybe a school thrown in, and some -- you know, a church.,They are just incredibly expensive. 
 But let me show you how to work this device.,So let's go to step one.,First thing that you do is you select a star,in the night sky, if you're telling time at night.,So, tonight, if it's clear you'll be able to see the summer triangle.,And there is a bright star called Deneb. So let's select Deneb.,Second, is you measure the altitude of Deneb.,So, step two, I hold the device up,,and then I sight its altitude there,so I can see it clearly now.,And then I measure its altitude.,So, it's about 26 degrees. You can't see it from over there.,Step three is identify the star on the front of the device.,Deneb is there. I can tell.,Step four is I then move the rete,,move the sky, so the altitude of the star,corresponds to the scale on the back.,Okay, so when that happens,everything lines up.,I have here a model of the sky,that corresponds to the real sky. Okay?,So, it is, in a sense,,holding a model of the universe in my hands.,And then finally, I take a rule,,and move the rule to a date line,which then tells me the time here.,Right. So, that's how the device is used.,(Laughter) 
 So, I know what you're thinking:,"That's a lot of work, isn't it? Isn't it a ton of work to be able to tell the time?",as you glance at your iPod to just check out the time.,But there is a difference between the two, because with your iPod,you can tell -- or your iPhone, you can tell exactly,what the time is, with precision.,The way little Lewis would tell the time,is by a picture of the sky.,He would know where things would fit in the sky.,He would not only know what time it was,,he would also know where the sun would rise,,and how it would move across the sky.,He would know what time the sun would rise, and what time it would set.,And he would know that for essentially every celestial object,in the heavens. 
 So, in computer graphics,and computer user interface design,,there is a term called affordances.,So, affordances are the qualities of an object,that allow us to perform an action with it.,And what the astrolabe does is it allows us,,it affords us, to connect to the night sky,,to look up into the night sky and be much more --,to see the visible and the invisible together.,So, that's just one use. Incredible,,there is probably 350, 400 uses.,In fact, there is a text, and that has over a thousand uses,of this first computer. 
 On the back there is scales and measurements,for terrestrial navigation.,You can survey with it. The city of Baghdad was surveyed with it.,It can be used for calculating mathematical equations of all different types.,And it would take a full university course to illustrate it.,Astrolabes have an incredible history.,They are over 2,000 years old.,The concept of stereographic projection,originated in 330 B.C. 
 And the astrolabes come in many different,sizes and shapes and forms.,There is portable ones. There is large display ones.,And I think what is common to all astrolabes,is that they are beautiful works of art.,There is a quality of craftsmanship and precision,that is just astonishing and remarkable. 
 Astrolabes, like every technology, do evolve over time.,So, the earliest retes, for example, were very simple and primitive.,And advancing retes became cultural emblems.,This is one from Oxford.,And I find this one really extraordinary because the rete pattern,is completely symmetrical,,and it accurately maps a completely asymmetrical, or random sky.,How cool is that? This is just amazing. 
 So, would little Lewis have an astrolabe?,Probably not one made of brass. He would have one made out of wood,,or paper. And the vast majority of this first computer,was a portable device,that you could keep in the back of your pocket.,So, what does the astrolabe inspire?,Well, I think the first thing is that,it reminds us just how resourceful people were,,our forebears were, years and years ago.,It's just an incredible device. 
 Every technology advances.,Every technology is transformed and moved by others.,And what we gain with a new technology, of course,,is precision and accuracy.,But what we lose, I think, is,an accurate -- a felt sense,of the sky, a sense of context.,Knowing the sky, knowing your relationship with the sky,,is the center of the real answer,to knowing what time it is. 
 So, it's -- I think astrolabes are just remarkable devices.,And so, what can you learn from these devices?,Well, primarily that there is a subtle knowledge,that we can connect with the world.,And astrolabes return us to this subtle sense,of how things all fit together,,and also how we connect to the world.,Thanks very much.,(Applause)Thank you.,Two years ago, I stood on the TED stage in Arusha, Tanzania.,I spoke very briefly about one of my proudest creations.,It was a simple machine that changed my life. 
 Before that time,,I had never been away from my home,in Malawi.,I had never used a computer.,I had never seen an Internet.,On the stage that day, I was so nervous.,My English lost,,I wanted to vomit.,(Laughter),I had never been surrounded by so many azungu,,white people.,(Laughter) 
 There was a story I wouldn't tell you then.,But well, I'm feeling good right now.,I would like to share that story today.,We have seven children in my family.,All sisters, excepting me.,This is me with my dad when I was a little boy.,Before I discovered the wonders of science,,I was just a simple farmer,in a country of poor farmers.,Like everyone else, we grew maize. 
 One year our fortune turned very bad.,In 2001 we experienced an awful famine.,Within five months all Malawians began to starve to death.,My family ate one meal per day, at night.,Only three swallows of nsima for each one of us.,The food passes through our bodies.,We drop down to nothing. 
 In Malawi, the secondary school,,you have to pay school fees.,Because of the hunger, I was forced to drop out of school.,I looked at my father,and looked at those dry fields.,It was the future I couldn't accept. 
 I felt very happy to be at the secondary school,,so I was determined to do anything possible,to receive education.,So I went to a library.,I read books, science books, especially physics.,I couldn't read English that well.,I used diagrams and pictures,to learn the words around them. 
 Another book put that knowledge in my hands.,It said a windmill could pump water and generate electricity.,Pump water meant irrigation,,a defense against hunger,,which we were experiencing by that time.,So I decided I would build one windmill for myself.,But I didn't have materials to use,,so I went to a scrap yard,where I found my materials.,Many people, including my mother,,said I was crazy.,(Laughter) 
 I found a tractor fan,,shock absorber, PVC pipes.,Using a bicycle frame,and an old bicycle dynamo,,I built my machine.,It was one light at first.,And then four lights,,with switches, and even a circuit breaker,,modeled after an electric bell.,Another machine pumps water,for irrigation. 
 Queues of people start lining up at my house,(Laughter),to charge their mobile phone.,(Applause),I could not get rid of them.,(Laughter),And the reporters came too,,which lead to bloggers,and which lead to a call from something called TED.,I had never seen an airplane before.,I had never slept in a hotel.,So, on stage that day in Arusha,,my English lost,,I said something like,,"I tried. And I made it." 
 So I would like to say something,to all the people out there like me,to the Africans, and the poor,who are struggling with your dreams.,God bless.,Maybe one day you will watch this on the Internet.,I say to you, trust yourself and believe.,Whatever happens, don't give up.,Thank you.,(Applause)Well, I learned a lot of things about ballooning,,especially at the end of these balloon flights,around the world I did with Brian Jones.,When I took this picture,,the window was frozen because of the moisture of the night.,And on the other side there was a rising sun.,So, you see that on the other side of ice,you have the unknown,,you have the non-obvious,,you have the non-seen,,for the people who don't dare,to go through the ice. 
 There are so many people,who prefer to suffer in the ice they know,instead of taking the risk of going through the ice,to see what there is on the other side.,And I think that's one of the main problems of our society.,We learn, maybe not the famous TED audience,,but so many other people learn,,that the unknown, the doubts,,the question marks are dangerous.,And we have to resist to the changes.,We have to keep everything under control.,Well, the unknown is part of life. 
 And in that sense, ballooning is a beautiful metaphor.,Because in the balloon, like in life,,we go very well in unforeseen directions.,We want to go in a direction,,but the winds push us in another direction, like in life.,And as long as we fight horizontally,,against life, against the winds,,against what's happening to us,,life is a nightmare. 
 How do we steer a balloon?,By understanding that the atmosphere,is made out of several different layers of wind,which all have different direction.,So, then, we understand that if we want to change our trajectory,,in life, or in the balloon,,we have to change altitude.,Changing altitude, in life,,that means raising to another psychological, philosophical,,spiritual level.,But how do we do that? 
 In ballooning, or in life,,how do we change altitude?,How do we go from the metaphor,to something more practical that we can really,use every day?,Well, in a balloon it's easy, we have ballast.,And when we drop the ballast overboard we climb.,Sand, water, all the equipment we don't need anymore.,And I think in life it should be exactly like this. 
 You know, when people speak about pioneering spirit,,very often they believe that pioneers,are the ones who have new ideas.,It's not true.,The pioneers are not the ones who have new ideas,,because new ideas are so easy to have.,We just close our eyes for a minute we all come back,with a lot of new ideas.,No, the pioneer is the one who,allows himself to throw overboard a lot of ballast.,Habits, certainties,,convictions, exclamation marks,,paradigms, dogmas.,And when we are able to do that,,what happens?,Life is not anymore,just one line going in one direction,in one dimension. No.,Life is going to be made out of all the possible lines,that go in all the possible directions,in three dimensions. 
 And pioneering spirit will be each time we allow ourselves,to explore this vertical axis.,Of course not just like the atmosphere in the balloon,,but in life itself.,Explore this vertical axis, that means,explore all the different ways to do,,all the different ways to behave, all the different ways to think,,before we find the one that goes in the direction we wish.,This is very practical.,This can be in politics.,This can be in spirituality.,This can be in environment,,in finance, in education of children. 
 I deeply believe,that life is a much greater adventure,if we manage to do politics,without the trench between the left and the right wing.,Because we will throw away these political dogmas.,I deeply believe that we can make much more protection of the environment,if we get rid -- if we throw overboard,this fundamentalism that some of the greens have showed in the past.,And that we can aim for much higher spirituality,if we get rid of the religious dogmas.,Throwing overboard, as ballast, to change our direction. 
 Well, these basically are things I believed in such a long time.,But actually I had to go around the world in a balloon,to be invited to talk about it.,(Laughter),(Applause),It's clear that it's not easy to know which ballast to drop,and which altitude to take. Sometime we need,friends, family members or a psychiatrist.,Well, in balloons we need weather men,,the one who calculate the direction of each layer of wind,,at which altitude, in order to help the balloonist.,But sometimes it's very paradoxical. 
 When Brian Jones and I were flying around the world,,the weather man asked us, one day, to fly,quite low, and very slow.,And when we calculated we thought we're never going to make it,around the world at that speed.,So, we disobeyed. We flew much higher, and double the speed. 
 And I was so proud to have found that jetstream,that I called the weather man,,and I told him, "Hey, guy, don't you think we're good pilots up there?,We fly twice the speed you predicted.",And he told me, "Don't do that. Go down immediately,in order to slow down.",And I started to argue. I said, "I'm not going to do that.,We don't have enough gas to fly so slow.",And he told me, "Yes, but with the low pressure you have on your left,if you fly too fast, in a couple of hours,you will turn left and end up at the North Pole.,(Laughter),And then he asked me --,and this is something I will never forget in my life --,he just asked me, "You're the good pilot up there.,What do you really want? You want to go very fast,in the wrong direction, or slowly in the good direction?,(Laughter),(Applause) 
 And this is why you need weathermen.,This is why you need people with long-term vision.,And this is precisely what fails,in the political visions we have now,,in the political governments.,We are burning, as you heard,,so much energy,,not understanding that such an unsustainable,way of life cannot last for long.,So, we went down actually.,We slowed down. And we went through moments of fears,because we had no idea how the little amount of gas,we had in the balloon,could allow us to travel 45,000 kilometers.,But we were expected to have doubts; we're expected to have fears.,And actually this is where the adventure really started. 
 When we were flying over the Sahara and India,it was nice holidays.,We could land anytime and fly back home with an airplane.,In the middle of the Pacific,,when you don't have the good winds, you cannot land,,you cannot go back.,That's a crisis.,That's the moment when you have to wake up,from the automatic way of thinking.,That's the moment when you have to motivate,your inner potential,,your creativity.,That's when you throw out all the ballast,,all the certainties,,in order to adapt to the new situation. 
 And actually, we changed completely our flight plan.,We changed completely our strategy.,And after 20 days we landed successfully in Egypt.,But if I show you this picture,it's not to tell you how happy we were.,It's to show you how much gas was left,in the last bottles.,We took off with 3.7 tons of liquid propane.,We landed with 40 kilos. 
 When I saw that, I made a promise to myself.,I made a promise that the next time I would fly around the world,,it would be with no fuel,,independent from fossil energies,,in order to be safe,,not to be threatened by the fuel gauge.,I had no idea how it was possible.,I just thought it's a dream and I want to do it. 
 And when the capsule of my balloon was introduced,officially in the Air and Space Museum in Washington,,together with the airplane of Charles Lindbergh,,with Apollo 11, with the Wright Brothers' Flyer,,with Chuck Yeager's 61,,I had really a thought then.,I thought, well, the 20th century, that was brilliant.,It allowed to do all those things there.,But it will not be possible in the future any more.,It takes too much energy. It will cost too much.,It will be prohibited,because we'll have to save our natural resources,in a few decades from now. 
 So how can we perpetuate,this pioneering spirit,with something that will be independent from fossil energy?,And this is when the project Solar Impulse,really started to,turn in my head.,And I think it's a nice metaphor also,for the 21st century.,Pioneering spirit should continue, but on another level.,Not to conquer the planet or space,,not anymore, it has been done,,but rather to improve the quality of life.,How can we go through the ice of certainty,in order to make the most incredible a possible thing?,What is today completely impossible --,get rid of our dependency on fossil energy. 
 If you tell to people, we want to be independent,from fossil energy in our world,,people will laugh at you, except here,,where crazy people are invited to speak.,(Laughter),So, the idea is that if we fly around the world,in a solar powered airplane,,using absolutely no fuel,,nobody ever could say in the future,that it's impossible to do it,for cars, for heating systems,,for computers, and so on and so on. 
 Well, solar power airplanes are not new.,They have flown in the past, but without,saving capabilities, without batteries.,Which means that they have more proven,the limits of renewable energies,than the potential of it.,If we want to show the potential,,we have to fly day and night.,That means to load the batteries during the flight,,in order to spend the night on the batteries,,and fly the next day again.,It has been made, already, on remote controlled,little airplane models, without pilots. 
 But it stays an anecdote,because the public couldn't identify to it.,I think you need a pilot in the plane,that can talk to the universities,,that can talk to students,,talk to politicians during the flight,,and really make it a human adventure.,For that, unfortunately,,four meters wingspan is not enough.,You need 64 meter wingspan.,64 meter wingspan to carry one pilot, the batteries,,flies slowly enough with the aerodynamic efficiency.,Why that? Because fuel is not easy to replace.,That's for sure.,And with 200 square meters of solar power on our plane,,we can produce the same energy,than 200 little lightbulbs.,That means a Christmas tree, a big Christmas tree. 
 So the question is, how can you carry a pilot around the world,with an airplane that uses,the same amount of energy as a big Christmas tree?,People will tell you it's impossible,,and that's exactly why we try to do it.,We launched the project with my colleague Andre Borschberg,six years ago.,We have now 70 people in the team working on it.,We have gone through the stages of simulation, design,,computing, preparing the construction,of the first prototype.,That has been achieved after two years of work.,Cockpit, propeller, engine.,Just the fuselage here, it's so light.,It's not designed by an artist, but it could be.,50 kilos for the entire fuselage.,Couple of kilos more for the wing spars. 
 This is the complete structure of the airplane.,And one month ago we have unveiled it.,You cannot imagine how it is for a team,who has been working six years on it,to show that it's not only a dream and a vision,,it's a real airplane.,A real airplane that we could finally present. 
 And what's the goal now?,The goal is to take off,,end of this year for the first test,,but mainly next year, spring or summer,,take off, on our own power,,without additional help, without being towed,,climb to 9,000 meters altitude.,The same time we load the batteries,,we run the engines, and when we get at the maximum height,,we arrive at the beginning of the night.,And there, there will be just one goal, just one:,reach the next sunrise before the batteries are empty.,(Laughter) 
 And this is exactly the symbol of our world.,If our airplane is too heavy,,if the pilot wastes energy,,we'll never make it through the night.,And in our world, if we keep on spoiling,,wasting our energy resources,,if we keep on building things that consume so much energy,that most of the companies now go bankrupt,,it's clear that we'll never give the planet to the next generation,without a major problem. 
 So, you see that this airplane is more a symbol.,I don't think it will transport 200 people,in the next years.,But when Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic,,the payload was also just sufficient,for one person and some fuel.,And 20 years later there were 200 people,in every airplane crossing the Atlantic. 
 So, we have to start,,and show the example.,A little bit like on this picture here.,This is a painting from Magritte,,in the museum in Holland that I love so much.,It's a pipe, and it's written, "This is not a pipe.",This is not an airplane.,This is a symbol of what we can achieve,when we believe in the impossible,,when we have a team,,when we have pioneering spirit,,and especially when we understand,that all the certainties we have,should be thrown overboard. 
 What pleases me very much,is that in the beginning I thought that we would have to fly,around the world with no fuel,in order to have our message been understood.,And more and more, we're invited around the world with Andre,to talk about that project, to talk about the symbol of it,,invited by politicians, invited in energy forums,,in order to show that it's not anymore,completely stupid,to think about getting rid of the dependency,on fossil energies. 
 So, through speeches like this one today,,through interviews, through meetings,,our goal is to get as many people possible on the team.,The success will not come,if we "just," quote, unquote,,fly around the world in a solar-powered airplane.,No, the success will come,if enough people are motivated,to do exactly the same in their daily life,,save energy, go to renewables.,And this is possible. You know, with the technologies we have today,,we can save between 30 and 50 percent,of the energy of a country in Europe,,and we can solve half of the rest with renewables.,It leaves 25 or 30 percent for,oil, gas, coal, nuclear, or whatever.,This is acceptable. 
 This is why all the people who believe,in this type of spirit,are welcome to be on that team.,You can just go on SolarImpulse.com, subscribe,to just be informed of what we're doing.,But much more, to get advices,,to give your comments, to spread the word,that if it's possible in the air,,of course it's possible in the ground. 
 And each time we have some ice in the future,,we have to know that life will be great,,and the success will be brilliant,if we dare to overcome our fear of the ice,,to go through the obstacle,,to go through the problem, in order to see what there is on the other side.,So, you see, this is what we're doing on our side.,Everyone has his goal, has his dreams,,has his visions. 
 The question I leave you with now,is which is the ballast,you would like to throw overboard?,Which will be the altitude at which,you would like to fly in your life,,to get to the success that you wish to have,,to get to the point that really belongs to you,,with the potential you have,,and the one you can really fulfill?,Because the most renewable energy we have,is our own potential, and our own passion.,So, let's go for it, and I wish you an excellent adventure,in the wings of the future. Thank you.,(Applause)I need to make a confessionnat the outset here.,A little over 20 years ago,nI did something that I regret,,something that I'm notnparticularly proud of.,Something that, in many ways,nI wish no one would ever know,,but here I feel kind of obliged to reveal. 
 (Laughter) 
 In the late 1980s,,in a moment of youthful indiscretion,,I went to law school. 
 (Laughter) 
 In America, law is a professional degree:,after your university degree,nyou go on to law school.,When I got to law school,,I didn't do very well.,To put it mildly, I didn't do very well.,I, in fact, graduated in the partnof my law school class,that made the top 90\% possible. 
 (Laughter) 
 Thank you.,I never practiced law a day in my life;,I pretty much wasn't allowed to. 
 (Laughter) 
 But today, against my better judgment,,against the advice of my own wife,,I want to try to dust offnsome of those legal skills --,what's left of those legal skills.,I don't want to tell you a story.,I want to make a case.,I want to make a hard-headed,,evidence-based,,dare I say lawyerly case,,for rethinking how we run our businesses. 
 So, ladies and gentlemen of the jury,,take a look at this.,This is called the candle problem.,Some of you might know it.,It's created in 1945,by a psychologist named Karl Duncker.,He created this experiment,that is used in many other experimentsnin behavioral science.,And here's how it works.nSuppose I'm the experimenter.,I bring you into a room.,I give you a candle,nsome thumbtacks and some matches.,And I say to you,,"Your job is to attachnthe candle to the wall,so the wax doesn't drip onto the table.",Now what would you do? 
 Many people begin tryingnto thumbtack the candle to the wall.,Doesn't work.,I saw somebodynkind of make the motion over here --,some people have a great ideanwhere they light the match,,melt the side of the candle,ntry to adhere it to the wall.,It's an awesome idea. Doesn't work.,And eventually, after five or ten minutes,,most people figure out the solution,,which you can see here. 
 The key is to overcomenwhat's called functional fixedness.,You look at that box and you see itnonly as a receptacle for the tacks.,But it can also have this other function,,as a platform for the candle.,The candle problem. 
 I want to tell you about an experimentnusing the candle problem,,done by a scientist named Sam Glucksberg,,who is now at Princeton University, US,,This shows the power of incentives. 
 He gathered his participants and said:,"I'm going to time you, how quicklynyou can solve this problem.",To one group he said,,"I'm going to time you to establish norms,,averages for how long it typically takesnsomeone to solve this sort of problem." 
 To the second group he offered rewards.,He said, "If you're in the top 25\%nof the fastest times,,you get five dollars.,If you're the fastest of everyonenwe're testing here today,,you get 20 dollars.",Now this is several years ago,nadjusted for inflation,,it's a decent sum of moneynfor a few minutes of work.,It's a nice motivator. 
 Question:,How much faster did this groupnsolve the problem? 
 Answer:,It took them, on average,nthree and a half minutes longer.,3.5 min longer.,This makes no sense, right?,I mean, I'm an American.nI believe in free markets.,That's not how it's supposednto work, right? 
 (Laughter) 
 If you want people to perform better,nyou reward them. Right?,Bonuses, commissions,ntheir own reality show.,Incentivize them.,That's how business works.,But that's not happening here.,You've got an incentive designed,to sharpen thinkingnand accelerate creativity,,and it does just the opposite.,It dulls thinking and blocks creativity. 
 What's interesting about this experiment,is that it's not an aberration.,This has been replicatednover and over again,for nearly 40 years.,These contingent motivators --,if you do this, then you get that --,work in some circumstances.,But for a lot of tasks,nthey actually either don't work,or, often, they do harm.,This is one of the most robust findingsnin social science,,and also one of the most ignored. 
 I spent the last couple of years,looking at the sciencenof human motivation,,particularly the dynamicsnof extrinsic motivators,and intrinsic motivators.,And I'm telling you, it's not even close.,If you look at the science,nthere is a mismatch,between what science knows,and what business does. 
 What's alarming herenis that our business operating system --,think of the set of assumptionsnand protocols beneath our businesses,,how we motivate people,nhow we apply our human resources--,it's built entirelynaround these extrinsic motivators,,around carrots and sticks.,That's actually fine for many kindsnof 20th century tasks.,But for 21st century tasks,,that mechanistic,nreward-and-punishment approach,doesn't work,,often doesn't work,,and often does harm.,Let me show you. 
 Glucksberg did another similar experiment,,he presented the problemnin a slightly different way,,like this up here.,Attach the candle to the wallnso the wax doesn't drip onto the table.,Same deal. You: we're timing for norms.,You: we're incentivizing. 
 What happened this time?,This time, the incentivized groupnkicked the other group's butt.,Why?,Because when the tacks are out of the box,,it's pretty easy isn't it? 
 (Laughter) 
 If-then rewards work really wellnfor those sorts of tasks,,where there is a simple set of rules,and a clear destination to go to.,Rewards, by their very nature,,narrow our focus, concentrate the mind;,that's why they work in so many cases.,So, for tasks like this,,a narrow focus, where you just seenthe goal right there,,zoom straight ahead to it,,they work really well. 
 But for the real candle problem,,you don't want to be looking like this.,The solution is on the periphery.nYou want to be looking around.,That reward actually narrows our focus,and restricts our possibility. 
 Let me tell you why this is so important.,In western Europe,,in many parts of Asia,,in North America, in Australia,,white-collar workers are doingnless of this kind of work,,and more of this kind of work.,That routine, rule-based,nleft-brain work --,certain kinds of accounting,nfinancial analysis,,computer programming --,has become fairly easy to outsource,,fairly easy to automate.,Software can do it faster.,Low-cost providers can do it cheaper.,So what really matters,are the more right-brainedncreative, conceptual kinds of abilities. 
 Think about your own work.,Think about your own work.,Are the problems that you face,,or even the problemsnwe've been talking about here,,do they have a clear set of rules,,and a single solution?,No. The rules are mystifying.,The solution, if it exists at all,,is surprising and not obvious.,Everybody in this room,is dealing with their own versionnof the candle problem.,And for candle problems of any kind,,in any field,,those if-then rewards,,the things around which we've builtnso many of our businesses,,don't work! 
 It makes me crazy.,And here's the thing.,This is not a feeling.,Okay? I'm a lawyer;nI don't believe in feelings.,This is not a philosophy.,I'm an American;nI don't believe in philosophy. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is a fact --,or, as we say in my hometownnof Washington, D.C.,,a true fact. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Let me give you an example.,Let me marshal the evidence here.,I'm not telling a story,nI'm making a case.,Ladies and gentlemennof the jury, some evidence:,Dan Ariely, one of the greatneconomists of our time,,he and three colleaguesndid a study of some MIT students.,They gave these MITnstudents a bunch of games,,games that involved creativity,,and motor skills, and concentration.,And the offered them, for performance,,three levels of rewards:,small reward, medium reward,nlarge reward.,If you do really wellnyou get the large reward, on down. 
 What happened?,As long as the taskninvolved only mechanical skill,bonuses worked as they would be expected:,the higher the pay,nthe better the performance.,Okay?,But once the task callednfor even rudimentary cognitive skill,,a larger reward led to poorer performance. 
 Then they said,,"Let's see if there's anyncultural bias here.,Let's go to Madurai, India and test it.",Standard of living is lower.,In Madurai, a reward that is modestnin North American standards,,is more meaningful there.,Same deal. A bunch of games,nthree levels of rewards. 
 What happens?,People offered the medium level of rewards,did no better than peoplenoffered the small rewards.,But this time,npeople offered the highest rewards,,they did the worst of all.,In eight of the nine tasks we examinednacross three experiments,,higher incentives lednto worse performance. 
 Is this some kind of touchy-feelynsocialist conspiracy going on here?,No, these are economists from MIT,,from Carnegie Mellon,nfrom the University of Chicago.,Do you know who sponsored this research?,The Federal Reserve Banknof the United States.,That's the American experience. 
 Let's go across the pondnto the London School of Economics,,LSE, London School of Economics,,alma mater of elevennNobel Laureates in economics.,Training ground for greatneconomic thinkers,like George Soros, and Friedrich Hayek,,and Mick Jagger. 
 (Laughter) 
 Last month,,just last month,,economists at LSE looked at 51 studies,of pay-for-performance plans,ninside of companies.,Here's what they said:,"We find that financial incentives,can result in a negative impactnon overall performance." 
 There is a mismatchnbetween what science knows,and what business does.,And what worries me,nas we stand here in the rubble,of the economic collapse,,is that too many organizationsnare making their decisions,,their policies about talent and people,,based on assumptions that are outdated,,unexamined,,and rooted more in folklorenthan in science.,And if we really want to getnout of this economic mess,,if we really want high performance,on those definitional tasksnof the 21st century,,the solution is not to donmore of the wrong things,,to entice people with a sweeter carrot,,or threaten them with a sharper stick.,We need a whole new approach. 
 The good news is that the scientists,who've been studying motivationnhave given us this new approach.,It's built much morenaround intrinsic motivation.,Around the desire to do thingsnbecause they matter,,because we like it, they're interesting,nor part of something important.,And to my mind, that new operatingnsystem for our businesses,revolves around three elements:,autonomy, mastery and purpose.,Autonomy: the urgento direct our own lives.,Mastery: the desire to get betternand better at something that matters.,Purpose: the yearning to do what we do,in the service of somethingnlarger than ourselves.,These are the building blocksnof an entirely new operating system,for our businesses. 
 I want to talk today only about autonomy.,In the 20th century, we came upnwith this idea of management.,Management did not emanate from nature.,Management is not a tree,nit's a television set.,Somebody invented it.,It doesn't meannit's going to work forever.,Management is great.,Traditional notionsnof management are great,if you want compliance.,But if you want engagement,nself-direction works better. 
 Some examples of some kindnof radical notions of self-direction.,You don't see a lot of it,,but you see the first stirringsnof something really interesting going on,,what it means is paying people adequatelynand fairly, absolutely --,getting the issue of money off the table,,and then giving people lots of autonomy. 
 Some examples.,How many of you have heardnof the company Atlassian?,It looks like less than half. 
 (Laughter) 
 Atlassian is an Australiannsoftware company.,And they do something incredibly cool.,A few times a yearnthey tell their engineers,,"Go for the next 24 hoursnand work on anything you want,,as long as it's not partnof your regular job.,Work on anything you want.",Engineers use this time to come upnwith a cool patch for code,,come up with an elegant hack.,Then they present all of the stuffnthat they've developed,to their teammates,nto the rest of the company,,in this wild and woolly all-hands meetingnat the end of the day.,Being Australians, everybody has a beer. 
 They call them FedEx Days.,Why?,Because you have to delivernsomething overnight.,It's pretty; not bad.,It's a huge trademark violation,nbut it's pretty clever. 
 (Laughter) 
 That one day of intense autonomy,has produced a whole arraynof software fixes,that might never have existed. 
 It's worked so well that Atlassiannhas taken it to the next level,with 20\% time --,done, famously, at Google --,where engineers can spendn20\% of their time,working on anything they want.,They have autonomy over their time,,their task, their team, their technique.,Radical amounts of autonomy.,And at Google, as many of you know,,about half of the new productsnin a typical year,are birthed during that 20\% time:,things like Gmail, Orkut, Google News. 
 Let me give you an even morenradical example of it:,something called the Results OnlynWork Environment (the ROWE),,created by two American consultants,,in place at a dozen companiesnaround North America.,In a ROWE people don't have schedules.,They show up when they want.,They don't have to be in the officenat a certain time, or any time.,They just have to get their work done.,How they do it, when they do it,nwhere they do it, is totally up to them.,Meetings in these kindsnof environments are optional. 
 What happens?,Almost across the board,,productivity goes up,nworker engagement goes up,,worker satisfaction goes up,nturnover goes down.,Autonomy, mastery and purpose,,the building blocksnof a new way of doing things. 
 Some of you might look at this and say,,"Hmm, that sounds nice, but it's Utopian.",And I say, "Nope.,I have proof.",The mid-1990s, Microsoft startednan encyclopedia called Encarta.,They had deployednall the right incentives,,They paid professionalsnto write and edit thousands of articles.,Well-compensated managersnoversaw the whole thing,to make sure it came innon budget and on time.,A few years later,nanother encyclopedia got started.,Different model, right?,Do it for fun.,No one gets paid a cent,nor a euro or a yen.,Do it because you like to do it. 
 Just 10 years ago,,if you had gone to an economist, anywhere,,"Hey, I've got these two differentnmodels for creating an encyclopedia.,If they went head to head, who would win?",10 years ago you could notnhave found a single sober economist,anywhere on planet Earth,who would have predictednthe Wikipedia model. 
 This is the titanic battlenbetween these two approaches.,This is the Ali-Fraziernof motivation, right?,This is the Thrilla in Manila.,Intrinsic motivatorsnversus extrinsic motivators.,Autonomy, mastery and purpose,,versus carrot and sticks, and who wins?,Intrinsic motivation, autonomy, masterynand purpose, in a knockout. 
 Let me wrap up.,There is a mismatch betweennwhat science knows and what business does.,Here is what science knows.,One: Those 20th century rewards,,those motivators we thinknare a natural part of business,,do work, but only in a surprisinglynnarrow band of circumstances.,Two: Those if-then rewardsnoften destroy creativity.,Three: The secret to high performancenisn't rewards and punishments,,but that unseen intrinsic drive--,the drive to do things for their own sake.,The drive to do things cause they matter. 
 And here's the best part.,We already know this.,The science confirmsnwhat we know in our hearts.,So, if we repair this mismatchnbetween science and business,,if we bring our motivation,nnotions of motivation,into the 21st century,,if we get past this lazy,ndangerous, ideology,of carrots and sticks,,we can strengthen our businesses,,we can solve a lotnof those candle problems,,and maybe, maybe --,we can change the world. 
 I rest my case. 
 (Applause)It's hard to believe that it's less than a year since the extraordinary moment,when the finance, the credit, which drives our economies froze.,A massive cardiac arrest.,The effect, the payback, perhaps, for years of vampire predators like Bernie Madoff,,whom we saw earlier.,Abuse of steroids, binging and so on.,And it's only a few months since governments,injected enormous sums of money to try and keep the whole system afloat.,And we're now in a very strange sort of twilight zone,,where no one quite knows what's worked, or what doesn't.,We don't have any very clear maps, any compass to guide us.,We don't know which experts to believe anymore. 
 What I'm going to try and do is to give some pointers,to what I think is the landscape on the other side of the crisis,,what things we should be looking out for,and how we can actually use the crisis.,There's a definition of leadership which says,,"It's the ability to use the smallest possible crisis,for the biggest possible effect.",And I want to talk about how we ensure that this crisis,,which is by no means small, really is used to the full. 
 I want to start just by saying a bit about where I'm coming from.,I've got a very confused background,which perhaps makes me appropriate for confused times.,I've got a Ph.D. in Telecoms, as you can see.,I trained briefly as a Buddhist monk under this guy.,I've been a civil servant,,and I've been in charge of policy for this guy as well. 
 But what I want to talk about begins when I was at this city, this university, as a student.,And then as now, it was a beautiful place of balls and punts, beautiful people,,many of whom took to heart Ronald Reagan's comment,that, "even if they say hard work doesn't do you any harm,,why risk it?" 
 But when I was here,,a lot of my fellow teenagers were in a very different situation,,leaving school at a time then of rapidly growing youth unemployment,,and essentially hitting a brick wall in terms of their opportunities.,And I spent quite a lot of time with them rather than in punts.,And they were people who were not short of wit, or grace or energy,,but they had no hope, no jobs, no prospects.,And when people aren't allowed to be useful,,they soon think that they're useless.,And although that was great for the music business at the time,,it wasn't much good for anything else.,And ever since then, I've wondered why it is that capitalism,is so amazingly efficient at some things, but so inefficient at others,,why it's so innovative in some ways and so un-innovative in others. 
 Now, since that time,,we've actually been through an extraordinary boom,,the longest boom ever in the history of this country.,Unprecedented wealth and prosperity,,but that growth hasn't always delivered what we needed.,H.L. Mencken once said that, "to every complex problem,,there is a simple solution and it's wrong.",But I'm not saying growth is wrong,,but it's very striking that throughout the years of growth,,many things didn't get better.,Rates of depression carried on up, right across the Western world.,If you look at America, the proportion of Americans,with no one to talk to about important things,went up from a tenth to a quarter.,We commuted longer to work, but as you can see from this graph,,the longer you commute the less happy you're likely to be.,And it became ever clearer that economic growth,doesn't automatically translate into social growth or human growth. 
 We're now at another moment,when another wave of teenagers are entering a cruel job market.,There will be a million unemployed young people here,by the end of the year,,thousands losing their jobs everyday in America.,We've got to do whatever we can to help them,,but we've also got to ask, I think, a more profound question,of whether we use this crisis to jump forward,to a different kind of economy that's more suited to human needs,,to a better balance of economy and society. 
 And I think one of the lessons of history is that,even the deepest crises can be moments of opportunity.,They bring ideas from the margins into the mainstream.,They often lead to the acceleration of much-needed reforms.,And you saw that in the '30s,,when the Great Depression paved the way,for Bretton Woods, welfare states and so on.,And I think you can see around us now,,some of the green shoots of a very different kind of economy and capitalism,which could grow.,You can see it in daily life.,When times are hard, people have to do things for themselves,,and right across the world, Oxford, Omaha, Omsk,,you can see an extraordinary explosion of urban farming,,people taking over land, taking over roofs,,turning barges into temporary farms. 
 And I'm a very small part of this.,I have 60,000 of these things in my garden.,A few of these. This is Atilla the hen.,And I'm a very small part of a very large movement,,which for some people is about survival,,but is also about values, about a different kind of economy,,which isn't so much about consumption and credit,,but about things which matter to us.,And everywhere too, you can see a proliferation of time banks,and parallel currencies,,people using smart technologies to link up,all the resources freed up by the market -- people, buildings, land --,and linking them to whomever has got the most compelling needs. 
 There's a similar story, I think, for governments.,Ronald Reagan, again, said the two funniest sentences,in the English language are,,"I'm from the government. And I'm here to help.",But I think last year when governments did step in,,people were quite glad that they were there, that they did act.,But now, a few months on,,however good politicians are at swallowing frogs,without pulling a face, as someone once put it,,they can't hide their uncertainty.,Because it's already clear,how much of the enormous amount of money they put into the economy,,really went into fixing the past, bailing out the banks, the car companies,,not preparing us for the future.,How much of the money is going into concrete and boosting consumption,,not into solving the really profound problems we have to solve. 
 And everywhere, as people think about the unprecedented sums,which are being spent of our money and our children's money,,now, in the depth of this crisis, they're asking:,Surely, we should be using this with a longer-term vision,to accelerate the shift to a green economy,,to prepare for aging, to deal with some of the inequalities,which scar countries like this and the United States,rather than just giving the money to the incumbents?,Surely, we should be giving the money to entrepreneurs, to civil society,,for people able to create the new,,not to the big, well-connected companies,,big, clunky government programs.,And, after all this, as the great Chinese sage Lao Tzu said,,"Governing a great country is like cooking a small fish.,Don't overdo it." 
 And I think more and more people are also asking:,Why boost consumption, rather than change what we consume?,Like the mayor of São Paulo who's banned advertising billboards,,or the many cities like San Francisco,putting in infrastructures for electric cars.,You can see a bit of the same thing happening in the business world.,Some, I think some of the bankers,who have appear to have learned nothing and forgotten nothing.,But ask yourselves: What will be the biggest sectors of the economy,in 10, 20, 30 years time? It won't be the ones lining up for handouts,,like cars and aerospace and so on. 
 The biggest sector, by far, will be health --,already 18 percent of the American economy,,predicted to grow to 30, even 40 percent by mid-century.,Elder care, child care, already much bigger employers than cars.,Education: six, seven, eight percent of the economy and growing.,Environmental services, energy services, the myriad of green jobs,,they're all pointing to a very different kind of economy,which isn't just about products, but is using distributed networks,,and it's founded above all on care, on relationships,,on what people do to other people, often one to one,,rather than simply selling them a product. 
 And I think that what connects the challenge for civil society,,the challenge for governments and the challenge for business now,is, in a way, a very simple one, but quite a difficult one.,We know our societies have to radically change.,We know we can't go back to where we were before the crisis.,But we also know it's only through experiment,that we'll discover exactly how to run a low carbon city,,how to care for a much older population,,how to deal with drug addiction and so on. 
 And here's the problem.,In science, we do experiments systematically.,Our societies now spend two, three, four percent of GDP,to invest systematically in new discovery, in science, in technology,,to fuel the pipeline of brilliant inventions,which illuminate gatherings like this.,It's not that our scientists are necessarily much smarter,than they were a hundred years ago, maybe they are,,but they have a hell of a lot more backing than they ever did.,And what's striking though,,is that in society there's almost nothing comparable,,no comparable investment,,no systematic experiment, in the things capitalism isn't very good at,,like compassion, or empathy, or relationships or care. 
 Now, I didn't really understand that until I met this guy,who was then an 80-year-old, slightly shambolic man,who lived on tomato soup and thought ironing was very overrated.,He had helped shape Britain's post-war institutions,,its welfare state, its economy,,but had sort of reinvented himself as a social entrepreneur,,became an inventor of many, many different organizations.,Some famous ones like the Open University, which has 110,000 students,,the University of the Third Age, which has nearly half a million older people,teaching other older people,,as well as strange things like DIY garages and language lines,and schools for social entrepreneurs.,And he ended his life selling companies to venture capitalists. 
 He believed if you see a problem, you shouldn't tell someone to act,,you should act on it yourself, and he lived long enough,and saw enough of his ideas first scorned and then succeed,that he said you should always take no as a question and not as an answer.,And his life was a systematic experiment to find better social answers,,not from a theory, but from experiment, and experiment involving the people,with the best intelligence on social needs,,which were usually the people living with those needs.,And he believed we live with others, we share the world with others,and therefore our innovation must be done with others too,,not doing things at people, for them, and so on. 
 Now, what he did didn't used to have a name,,but I think it's rapidly becoming quite mainstream.,It's what we do in the organization named after him,where we try and invent, create, launch new ventures,,whether it's schools, web companies, health organizations and so on.,And we find ourselves part of a very rapidly growing global movement,of institutions working on social innovation,,using ideas from design or technology or community organizing,to develop the germs of a future world, but through practice and through demonstration,and not through theory.,And they're spreading from Korea to Brazil to India to the USA,and across Europe.,And they've been given new momentum by the crisis, by the need for better answers,to joblessness, community breakdown and so on. 
 Some of the ideas are strange.,These are complaints choirs.,People come together to sing about the things that really bug them.,(Laughter),Others are much more pragmatic: health coaches, learning mentors, job clubs.,And some are quite structural, like social impact bonds,where you raise money to invest in diverting teenagers from crime,or helping old people keep out of hospital,,and you get paid back according to how successful your projects are. 
 Now, the idea that all of this represents,,I think, is rapidly becoming a common sense,and part of how we respond to the crisis,,recognizing the need to invest in innovation for social progress,as well as technological progress.,There were big health innovation funds,launched earlier this year in this country,,as well as a public service innovation lab.,Across northern Europe, many governments,now have innovation laboratories within them.,And just a few months ago, President Obama,launched the Office of Social Innovation in the White House. 
 And what people are beginning to ask is:,Surely, just as we invest in R and D, two, three, four percent,,of our GDP, of our economy,,what if we put, let's say, one percent of public spending,into social innovation, into elder care, new kinds of education,,new ways of helping the disabled?,Perhaps we'd achieve similar productivity gains in society,to those we've had in the economy and in technology. 
 And if, a generation or two ago, the big challenges,were ones like getting a man on the moon,,perhaps the challenges we need to set ourselves now,are ones like eliminating child malnutrition, stopping trafficking,,or one, I think closer to home for America or Europe,,why don't we set ourselves the goal,of achieving a billion extra years of life for today's citizens.,Now those are all goals which could be achieved within a decade,,but only with radical and systematic experiment,,not just with technologies, but also with lifestyles and culture,and policies and institutions too. 
 Now, I want to end by saying a little bit about what I think this means for capitalism.,I think what this is all about, this whole movement,which is growing from the margins, remains quite small.,Nothing like the resources of a CERN or a DARPA or an IBM or a Dupont.,What it's telling us is that capitalism is going to become more social.,It's already immersed in social networks.,It will become more involved in social investment, and social care,and in industries where the value comes from what you do with others,,not just from what you sell to them,,and from relationships as well as from consumption.,But interestingly too, it implies a future where society learns a few tricks from capitalism,about how you embed the DNA of restless continual innovation,into society, trying things out and then growing and scaling the ones that work. 
 Now, I think this future will be quite surprising to many people.,In recent years, a lot of intelligent people thought that capitalism had basically won.,History was over,and society would inevitably have to take second place to economy.,But I've been struck with a parallel in how people often talk about capitalism today,and how they talked about the monarchy 200 years ago,,just after the French Revolution and the restoration of the monarchy in France. 
 Then, people said monarchy dominated everywhere,because it was rooted in human nature.,We were naturally deferential. We needed hierarchy.,Just as today, the enthusiasts of unrestrained capitalism,say it's rooted in human nature,,only now it's individualism, inquisitiveness, and so on.,Then monarchy had seen off its big challenger, mass democracy,,which was seen as a well-intentioned but doomed experiment,,just as capitalism has seen off socialism.,Even Fidel Castro now says that the only thing worse,than being exploited by multinational capitalism,is not being exploited by multinational capitalism.,And whereas then monarchies, palaces and forts dominated every city skyline,and looked permanent and confident,,today it's the gleaming towers of the banks which dominate every big city. 
 I'm not suggesting the crowds are about to storm the barricades,and string up every investment banker from the nearest lamppost,,though that might be quite tempting.,But I do think we're on the verge of a period when,,just as happened to the monarchy and, interestingly, the military too,,the central position of finance capital is going to come to an end,,and it's going to steadily move to the sides, the margins of our society,,transformed from being a master into a servant,,a servant to the productive economy and of human needs. 
 And as that happens,,we will remember something very simple and obvious about capitalism,,which is that, unlike what you read in economics textbooks,,it's not a self-sufficient system.,It depends on other systems,,on ecology, on family, on community,,and if these aren't replenished, capitalism suffers too.,And our human nature isn't just selfish, it's also compassionate.,It's not just competitive, it's also caring.,Because of the depth of the crisis, I think we are at a moment of choice. 
 The crisis is almost certainly deepening around us.,It will be worse at the end of this year,,quite possibly worse in a year's time than it is today.,But this is one of those very rare moments,when we have to choose whether we're just pedaling furiously,to get back to where we were a year or two ago,,and a very narrow idea of what the economy is for,,or whether this is a moment to jump ahead, to reboot,and to do some of the things we probably should have been doing anyway.,Thank you. 
 (Applause)The magical moment, the magical moment of conducting.,Which is, you go onto a stage. There is an orchestra sitting.,They are all, you know, warming up and doing stuff.,And I go on the podium.,You know, this little office of the conductor.,Or rather a cubicle, an open-space cubicle,,with a lot of space.,And in front of all that noise,,you do a very small gesture.,Something like this, not very pomp, not very sophisticated, this.,And suddenly, out of the chaos, order.,Noise becomes music. 
 And this is fantastic. And it's so tempting,to think that it's all about me.,(Laughter),All those great people here, virtuosos,,they make noise, they need me to do that.,Not really. If it were that,,I would just save you the talk,,and teach you the gesture.,So you could go out to the world,and do this thing in whatever company or whatever you want,,and you have perfect harmony. It doesn't work.,Let's look at the first video.,I hope you'll think it's a good example of harmony.,And then speak a little bit about how it comes about. 
 (Music) 
 Was that nice?,So that was a sort of a success.,Now, who should we thank for the success?,I mean, obviously the orchestra musicians,playing beautifully,,the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.,They don't often even look at the conductor.,Then you have the clapping audience, yeah,,actually taking part in doing the music.,You know Viennese audiences usually don't interfere with the music.,This is the closest to an Oriental bellydancing feast,that you will ever get in Vienna.,(Laughter) 
 Unlike, for example Israel, where audiences cough all the time.,You know, Arthur Rubinstein, the pianist, used to say,that, "Anywhere in the world, people that have the flu, they go to the doctor.,In Tel Aviv they come to my concerts.",(Laughter),So that's a sort of a tradition.,But Viennese audiences do not do that.,Here they go out of their regular, just to be part of that,,to become part of the orchestra, and that's great.,You know, audiences like you, yeah,,make the event. 
 But what about the conductor? What can you say,the conductor was doing, actually?,Um, he was happy.,And I often show this to senior management.,People get annoyed.,"You come to work. How come you're so happy?",Something must be wrong there, yeah? But he's spreading happiness.,And I think the happiness, the important thing is this happiness,does not come from,only his own story and his joy of the music.,The joy is about enabling other people's stories,to be heard at the same time. 
 You have the story of the orchestra as a professional body.,You have the story of the audience as a community. Yeah.,You have the stories of the individuals,in the orchestra and in the audience.,And then you have other stories, unseen.,People who build this wonderful concert hall.,People who made those Stradivarius, Amati, all those beautiful instruments.,And all those stories are being heard at the same time.,This is the true experience of a live concert.,That's a reason to go out of home. Yeah?,And not all conductors do just that.,Let's see somebody else, a great conductor.,Riccardo Muti, please. 
 (Music) 
 Yeah, that was very short, but you could see,it's a completely different figure. Right?,He's awesome. He's so commanding. Yeah?,So clear. Maybe a little bit over-clear.,Can we have a little demonstration? Would you be my orchestra for a second?,Can you sing, please, the first note of Don Giovanni?,You have to sing "Aaaaaah," and I'll stop you.,Okay? Ready? 
 Audience: ♫ Aaaaaaah ... ♫ 
 Itay Talgam: Come on, with me. If you do it without me,I feel even more redundant than I already feel.,So please, wait for the conductor.,Now look at me. "Aaaaaah," and I stop you. Let's go. 
 Audience: ♫ ... Aaaaaaaah ... ♫,(Laughter) 
 Itay Talgam: So we'll have a little chat later.,(Laughter),But ... There is a vacancy for a ...,But -- (Laughter),-- you could see that you could stop an orchestra with a finger.,Now what does Riccardo Muti do? He does something like this ...,(Laughter),And then -- sort of -- (Laughter),So not only the instruction is clear,,but also the sanction, what will happen if you don't do what I tell you.,(Laughter),So, does it work? Yes, it works --,to a certain point. 
 When Muti is asked, "Why do you conduct like this?",He says, "I'm responsible.",Responsible in front of him.,No he doesn't really mean Him. He means Mozart,,which is -- (Laughter) -- like a third seat from the center.,(Laughter),So he says, "If I'm --,(Applause),if I'm responsible for Mozart,,this is going to be the only story to be told.,It's Mozart as I, Riccardo Muti, understand it." 
 And you know what happened to Muti?,Three years ago he got a letter signed by,all 700 employees of La Scala,,musical employees, I mean the musicians,,saying, "You're a great conductor. We don't want to work with you. Please resign.",(Laughter),"Why? Because you don't let us develop.,You're using us as instruments, not as partners.,And our joy of music, etc., etc. ...",So he had to resign. Isn't that nice?,(Laughter),He's a nice guy. He's a really nice guy.,Well, can you do it with less control,,or with a different kind of control?,Let's look at the next conductor, Richard Strauss. 
 (Music) 
 I'm afraid you'll get the feeling that I really picked on him because he's old.,It's not true. When he was a young man,of about 30, he wrote what he called,"The Ten Commandments for Conductors.",The first one was: If you sweat by the end of the concert,it means that you must have done something wrong.,That's the first one. The fourth one you'll like better.,It says: Never look at the trombones --,it only encourages them.,(Laughter) 
 So, the whole idea is really to let,it happen by itself.,Do not interfere.,But how does it happen? Did you see,him turning pages in the score?,Now, either he is senile,,and doesn't remember his own music, because he wrote the music.,Or he is actually transferring a very strong message to them, saying,,"Come on guys. You have to play by the book.,So it's not about my story. It's not about your story.,It's only the execution of the written music,,no interpretation.",Interpretation is the real story of the performer.,So, no, he doesn't want that. That's a different kind of control.,Let's see another super-conductor,,a German super-conductor. Herbert von Karajan, please. 
 (Music) 
 What's different? Did you see the eyes? Closed.,Did you see the hands?,Did you see this kind of movement? Let me conduct you. Twice.,Once like a Muti, and you'll -- (Claps) -- clap, just once.,And then like Karajan. Let's see what happens. Okay?,Like Muti. You ready? Because Muti ...,(Laughter) Okay? Ready? Let's do it. 
 Audience: (Claps) 
 Itay Talgam: Hmm ... again. 
 Audience: (Claps),Itay Talgam: Good. Now like a Karajan. Since you're already trained,,let me concentrate, close my eyes. Come, come. 
 Audience: (Claps) (Laughter) 
 Itay Talgam: Why not together? (Laughter),Because you didn't know when to play.,Now I can tell you, even the Berlin Philharmonic,doesn't know when to play.,(Laughter),But I'll tell you how they do it. No cynicism.,This is a German orchestra, yes?,They look at Karajan. And then they look at each other.,(Laughter),"Do you understand what this guy wants?",And after doing that,,they really look at each other, and the first players of the orchestra,lead the whole ensemble in playing together. 
 And when Karajan is asked about it,he actually says, "Yes, the worst damage,I can do to my orchestra,is to give them a clear instruction.,Because that would,prevent the ensemble, the listening to each other,that is needed for an orchestra.",Now that's great. What about the eyes?,Why are the eyes closed?,There is a wonderful story about Karajan conducting in London.,And he cues in a flute player like this.,The guy has no idea what to do. (Laughter),"Maestro, with all due respect, when should I start?",What do you think Karajan's reply was? When should I start?,Oh yeah. He says, "You start when you can't stand it anymore.",(Laughter) 
 Meaning that you know you have no authority to change anything.,It's my music. The real music is only in Karajan's head.,And you have to guess my mind. So you are under tremendous pressure,because I don't give you instruction,,and yet, you have to guess my mind.,So it's a different kind of, a very spiritual but yet,very firm control.,Can we do it in another way? Of course we can. Let's go back,to the first conductor we've seen:,Carlos Kleiber, his name. Next video, please. 
 (Music) 
 (Laughter) Yeah.,Well, it is different. But isn't that controlling in the same way?,No, it's not, because he is not telling them what to do.,When he does this, it's not,,"Take your Stradivarius and like Jimi Hendrix,,smash it on the floor." It's not that.,He says, "This is the gesture of the music.,I'm opening a space for you,to put in another layer,of interpretation.",That is another story. 
 But how does it really work together,if it doesn't give them instructions?,It's like being on a rollercoaster. Yeah?,You're not really given any instructions,,but the forces of the process itself keep you in place.,That's what he does.,The interesting thing is of course the rollercoaster does not really exist.,It's not a physical thing. It's in the players' heads. 
 And that's what makes them into partners.,You have the plan in your head.,You know what to do, even though Kleiber is not conducting you.,But here and there and that. You know what to do.,And you become a partner building the rollercoaster,,yeah, with sound,,as you actually take the ride.,This is very exciting for those players.,They do need to go to a sanatorium for two weeks, later.,(Laughter),It is very tiring. Yeah?,But it's the best music making, like this. 
 But of course it's not only about motivation,and giving them a lot of physical energy.,You also have to be very professional.,And look again at this Kleiber.,Can we have the next video, quickly?,You'll see what happens when there is a mistake. 
 (Music) Again you see the beautiful body language.,(Music),And now there is a trumpet player who,does something not exactly the way it should be done.,Go along with the video. Look.,See, second time for the same player.,(Laughter) And now the third time for the same player.,(Laughter),"Wait for me after the concert.,I have a short notice to give you.",You know, when it's needed, the authority is there. It's very important.,But authority is not enough to make people your partners. 
 Let's see the next video, please. See what happens here.,You might be surprised having seen Kleiber,as such a hyperactive guy.,He's conducting Mozart.,(Music),The whole orchestra is playing.,(Music),Now something else.,(Music),See? He is there 100 percent,,but not commanding, not telling what to do.,Rather enjoying what the soloist is doing.,(Music) 
 Another solo now. See what you can pick up from this.,(Music),Look at the eyes.,Okay. You see that?,First of all, it's a kind of a compliment we all like to get.,It's not feedback. It's an "Mmmm ..." Yeah, it comes from here.,So that's a good thing.,And the second thing is,it's about actually being in control,,but in a very special way.,When Kleiber does -- did you see the eyes,,going from here? (Singing),You know what happens? Gravitation is no more. 
 Kleiber not only creates a process,,but also creates the conditions in the world,in which this process takes place.,So again, the oboe player,is completely autonomous,and therefore happy and proud of his work,,and creative and all of that.,And the level in which Kleiber is in control is in a different level.,So control is no longer a zero-sum game.,You have this control. You have this control. And all you put together,,in partnership, brings about the best music.,So Kleiber is about process.,Kleiber is about conditions in the world. 
 But you need to have process and content to create the meaning.,Lenny Bernstein, my own personal maestro.,Since he was a great teacher,,Lenny Bernstein always started from the meaning. Look at this, please. 
 (Music) 
 Do you remember the face of Muti, at the beginning?,Well he had a wonderful expression, but only one.,(Laughter),Did you see Lenny's face?,You know why? Because the meaning of the music is pain.,And you're playing a painful sound.,And you look at Lenny and he's suffering.,But not in a way that you want to stop.,It's suffering, like, enjoying himself in a Jewish way, as they say.,(Laughter),But you can see the music on his face.,You can see the baton left his hand. No more baton.,Now it's about you, the player,,telling the story.,Now it's a reversed thing. You're telling the story. And you're telling the story.,And even briefly, you become the storyteller,to which the community, the whole community, listens to.,And Bernstein enables that. Isn't that wonderful? 
 Now, if you are doing all the things we talked about, together,,and maybe some others,,you can get to this wonderful point of doing without doing.,And for the last video, I think this is simply the best title.,My friend Peter says,,"If you love something, give it away." So, please. 
 (Music) 
 (Applause)Metaphor lives a secret life all around us.,We utter about six metaphors a minute.,Metaphorical thinking is essential,to how we understand ourselves and others,,how we communicate, learn, discover,and invent.,But metaphor is a way of thought before it is a way with words. 
 Now, to assist me in explaining this,,I've enlisted the help of one of our greatest philosophers,,the reigning king of the metaphorians,,a man whose contributions to the field,are so great that he himself,has become a metaphor.,I am, of course, referring to none other,than Elvis Presley.,(Laughter) 
 Now, "All Shook Up" is a great love song.,It's also a great example of how,whenever we deal with anything abstract --,ideas, emotions, feelings, concepts, thoughts --,we inevitably resort to metaphor.,In "All Shook Up," a touch is not a touch, but a chill.,Lips are not lips, but volcanoes.,She is not she, but a buttercup.,And love is not love, but being all shook up. 
 In this, Elvis is following Aristotle's classic definition of metaphor,as the process of giving the thing,a name that belongs to something else.,This is the mathematics of metaphor.,And fortunately it's very simple.,X equals Y.,(Laughter),This formula works wherever metaphor is present. 
 Elvis uses it, but so does Shakespeare,in this famous line from "Romeo and Juliet:",Juliet is the sun.,Now, here, Shakespeare gives the thing, Juliet,,a name that belongs to something else, the sun.,But whenever we give a thing a name that belongs to something else,,we give it a whole network of analogies too.,We mix and match what we know about the metaphor's source,,in this case the sun,,with what we know about its target, Juliet.,And metaphor gives us a much more vivid understanding of Juliet,than if Shakespeare had literally described what she looks like. 
 So, how do we make and understand metaphors?,This might look familiar.,The first step is pattern recognition.,Look at this image. What do you see?,Three wayward Pac-Men,,and three pointy brackets are actually present.,What we see, however,,are two overlapping triangles.,Metaphor is not just the detection of patterns;,it is the creation of patterns.,Second step, conceptual synesthesia. 
 Now, synesthesia is the experience of a stimulus in once sense organ,in another sense organ as well,,such as colored hearing.,People with colored hearing,actually see colors when they hear the sounds,of words or letters.,We all have synesthetic abilities.,This is the Bouba/Kiki test.,What you have to do is identify which of these shapes,is called Bouba, and which is called Kiki.,(Laughter) 
 If you are like 98 percent of other people,,you will identify the round, amoeboid shape as Bouba,,and the sharp, spiky one as Kiki.,Can we do a quick show of hands?,Does that correspond?,Okay, I think 99.9 would about cover it.,Why do we do that?,Because we instinctively find, or create,,a pattern between the round shape,and the round sound of Bouba,,and the spiky shape and the spiky sound of Kiki. 
 And many of the metaphors we use everyday are synesthetic.,Silence is sweet.,Neckties are loud.,Sexually attractive people are hot.,Sexually unattractive people leave us cold.,Metaphor creates a kind of conceptual synesthesia,,in which we understand one concept,in the context of another. 
 Third step is cognitive dissonance.,This is the Stroop test.,What you need to do here is identify,as quickly as possible,the color of the ink in which these words are printed.,You can take the test now.,If you're like most people, you will experience,a moment of cognitive dissonance,when the name of the color,is printed in a differently colored ink.,The test shows that we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words,even when the literal meaning gives the wrong answer. 
 Stroop tests have been done with metaphor as well.,The participants had to identify, as quickly as possible,,the literally false sentences.,They took longer to reject metaphors as false,than they did to reject literally false sentences.,Why? Because we cannot ignore,the metaphorical meaning of words either. 
 One of the sentences was, "Some jobs are jails.",Now, unless you're a prison guard,,the sentence "Some jobs are jails" is literally false.,Sadly, it's metaphorically true.,And the metaphorical truth interferes with our ability,to identify it as literally false.,Metaphor matters because,it's around us every day, all the time.,Metaphor matters because it creates expectations. 
 Pay careful attention the next time you read the financial news.,Agent metaphors describe price movements,as the deliberate action of a living thing,,as in, "The NASDAQ climbed higher.",Object metaphors describe price movements,as non-living things,,as in, "The Dow fell like a brick." 
 Researchers asked a group of people,to read a clutch of market commentaries,,and then predict the next day's price trend.,Those exposed to agent metaphors,had higher expectations that price trends would continue.,And they had those expectations because,agent metaphors imply the deliberate action,of a living thing pursuing a goal.,If, for example, house prices,are routinely described as climbing and climbing,,higher and higher, people might naturally assume,that that rise is unstoppable.,They may feel confident, say,,in taking out mortgages they really can't afford.,That's a hypothetical example of course.,But this is how metaphor misleads. 
 Metaphor also matters because it influences decisions,by activating analogies.,A group of students was told that a small democratic country,had been invaded and had asked the U.S. for help.,And they had to make a decision.,What should they do?,Intervene, appeal to the U.N., or do nothing?,They were each then given one of three,descriptions of this hypothetical crisis.,Each of which was designed to trigger,a different historical analogy:,World War II, Vietnam,,and the third was historically neutral. 
 Those exposed to the World War II scenario,made more interventionist recommendations,than the others.,Just as we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words,,we cannot ignore the analogies,that are triggered by metaphor.,Metaphor matters because it opens the door to discovery.,Whenever we solve a problem, or make a discovery,,we compare what we know with what we don't know.,And the only way to find out about the latter,is to investigate the ways it might be like the former. 
 Einstein described his scientific method as combinatory play.,He famously used thought experiments,,which are essentially elaborate analogies,,to come up with some of his greatest discoveries.,By bringing together what we know,and what we don't know through analogy,,metaphorical thinking strikes the spark,that ignites discovery. 
 Now metaphor is ubiquitous, yet it's hidden.,But you just have to look at the words around you,and you'll find it.,Ralph Waldo Emerson described language,as "fossil poetry.",But before it was fossil poetry,language was fossil metaphor.,And these fossils still breathe. 
 Take the three most famous words in all of Western philosophy:,"Cogito ergo sum.",That's routinely translated as, "I think, therefore I am.",But there is a better translation.,The Latin word "cogito",is derived from the prefix "co," meaning "together,",and the verb "agitare," meaning "to shake.",So, the original meaning of "cogito",is to shake together.,And the proper translation of "cogito ergo sum",is "I shake things up, therefore I am.",(Laughter) 
 Metaphor shakes things up,,giving us everything from Shakespeare to scientific discovery in the process.,The mind is a plastic snow dome,,the most beautiful, most interesting,,and most itself, when, as Elvis put it,,it's all shook up.,And metaphor keeps the mind shaking,,rattling and rolling, long after Elvis has left the building.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)For years I've been feeling frustrated,,because as a religious historian,,I've become acutely aware,of the centrality of compassion,in all the major world faiths.,Every single one of them,has evolved their own version,of what's been called the Golden Rule.,Sometimes it comes in a positive version --,"Always treat all others as you'd like to be treated yourself.",And equally important,is the negative version --,"Don't do to others what you would not like them to do to you.",Look into your own heart,,discover what it is that gives you pain,and then refuse, under any circumstance whatsoever,,to inflict that pain on anybody else. 
 And people have emphasized the importance of compassion,,not just because it sounds good,,but because it works.,People have found that when they have,implemented the Golden Rule,as Confucius said, "all day and every day,",not just a question of doing your good deed for the day,and then returning to a life of greed,and egotism,,but to do it all day and every day,,you dethrone yourself from the center of your world,,put another there, and you transcend yourself.,And it brings you into the presence,of what's been called God, Nirvana, Rama, Tao.,Something that goes beyond,what we know in our ego-bound existence. 
 But you know you'd never know it a lot of the time,,that this was so central to the religious life.,Because with a few wonderful exceptions,,very often when religious people come together,,religious leaders come together, they're arguing about abstruse doctrines,or uttering a council of hatred,or inveighing against homosexuality or something of that sort.,Often people don't really want to be compassionate.,I sometimes see,when I'm speaking to a congregation of religious people,a sort of mutinous expression crossing their faces,because people often want to be right instead.,And that of course defeats the object of the exercise. 
 Now why was I so grateful to TED?,Because they took me very gently,from my book-lined study,and brought me into the 21st century,,enabling me to speak to a much, much wider audience,than I could have ever conceived.,Because I feel an urgency about this.,If we don't manage to implement,the Golden Rule globally,,so that we treat all peoples, wherever and whoever they may be,,as though they were as important as ourselves,,I doubt that we'll have,a viable world to hand on to the next generation. 
 The task of our time,,one of the great tasks of our time,,is to build a global society, as I said,,where people can live together in peace.,And the religions that should be making a major contribution,are instead seen as part of the problem.,And of course it's not just religious people who believe in the Golden Rule.,This is the source of all morality,,this imaginative act of empathy,,putting yourself in the place of another. 
 And so we have a choice, it seems to me.,We can either go on bringing out or emphasizing,the dogmatic and intolerant aspects of our faith,,or we can go back to,the rabbis. Rabbi Hillel, the older contemporary of Jesus,,who, when asked by a pagan,to sum up the whole of Jewish teaching while he stood on one leg,,said, "That which is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor.,That is the Torah and everything else is only commentary." 
 And the rabbis and the early fathers of the church who said that,any interpretation of scripture,that bred hatred and disdain was illegitimate.,And we need to revive that spirit.,And it's not just going to happen,because a spirit of love wafts us down.,We have to make this happen,,and we can do it,with the modern communications,that TED has introduced.,Already I've been tremendously heartened,at the response of all our partners. 
 In Singapore, we have a group,going to use the Charter to heal divisions,recently that have sprung up in Singaporean society,,and some members of the parliament want,to implement it politically.,In Malaysia, there is going to be an art exhibition,in which leading artists are going to be,taking people, young people,,and showing them that compassion also lies,at the root of all art.,Throughout Europe, the Muslim communities,are holding events and discussions,,are discussing the centrality of compassion,in Islam and in all faiths. 
 But it can't stop there. It can't stop with the launch.,Religious teaching, this is where we've gone so wrong,,concentrating solely on believing abstruse doctrines.,Religious teaching must always lead to action.,And I intend to work on this till my dying day.,And I want to continue with our partners,to do two things --,educate and stimulate compassionate thinking.,Education because we've so,dropped out of compassion.,People often think it simply means,feeling sorry for somebody.,But of course you don't understand compassion,if you're just going to think about it.,You also have to do it. 
 I want them to get the media involved,because the media are crucial,in helping to dissolve some of the stereotypical views,we have of other people,,which are dividing us from one another.,The same applies to educators.,I'd like youth to get a sense of,the dynamism, the dynamic and challenge,of a compassionate lifestyle.,And also see that it demands acute intelligence,,not just a gooey feeling. 
 I'd like to call upon scholars to explore,the compassionate theme,in their own and in other people's traditions.,And perhaps above all,,to encourage a sensitivity about,uncompassionate speaking,,so that because people have this Charter,,whatever their beliefs or lack of them,,they feel empowered,to challenge uncompassionate speech,,disdainful remarks,from their religious leaders, their political leaders,,from the captains of industry.,Because we can change the world,,we have the ability. 
 I would never have thought of putting the Charter online.,I was still stuck in the old world,of a whole bunch of boffins sitting together in a room,and issuing yet another arcane statement.,And TED introduced me to a whole new way,of thinking and presenting ideas.,Because that is what is so wonderful about TED.,In this room, all this expertise,,if we joined it all together,,we could change the world.,And of course the problems sometimes seem insuperable. 
 But I'd just like to quote, finish at the end,with a reference to a British author, an Oxford author,whom I don't quote very often,,C.S. Lewis.,But he wrote one thing that stuck in my mind,ever since I read it when I was a schoolgirl.,It's in his book "The Four Loves.",He said that he distinguished between erotic love,,when two people gaze, spellbound, into each other's eyes.,And then he compared that to friendship,,when two people stand side by side, as it were, shoulder to shoulder,,with their eyes fixed on a common goal. 
 We don't have to fall in love with each other,,but we can become friends.,And I am convinced.,I felt it very strongly,during our little deliberations at Vevey,,that when people of all different persuasions,come together, working side by side,for a common goal,,differences melt away.,And we learn amity.,And we learn to live together and to get to know one another.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)It's a bit funny to be,at a conference dedicated to things not seen,,and present my proposal to build,a 6,000-kilometer-long wall,across the entire African continent.,About the size of the Great Wall of China,,this would hardly be an invisible structure.,And yet it's made from parts that are invisible, or near-invisible, to the naked eye:,bacteria and grains of sand. 
 Now, as architects we're trained to solve problems.,But I don't really believe in architectural problems;,I only believe in opportunities.,Which is why I'll show you a threat,,and an architectural response.,The threat is desertification.,My response is a sandstone wall,made from bacteria and solidified sand,,stretching across the desert. 
 Now, sand is a magical material,of beautiful contradictions.,It is simple and complex.,It is peaceful and violent.,It is always the same, never the same,,endlessly fascinating.,One billion grains of sand,come into existence in the world each second.,That's a cyclical process.,As rocks and mountains die,,grains of sand are born.,Some of those grains may then cement naturally into sandstone.,And as the sandstone weathers, new grains break free.,Some of those grains may then accumulate,on a massive scale,,into a sand dune. 
 In a way, the static, stone mountain,becomes a moving mountain of sand.,But, moving mountains can be dangerous. Let me try and explain why.,Dry areas cover more than one third of the Earth's land surfaces.,Some are already deserts;,others are being seriously degraded by the sand.,Just south of the Sahara we find the Sahel.,The name means "edge of the desert.",And this is the region most closely associated with desertification.,It was here in the late '60s and early '70s,that major droughts brought three million people,to become dependent upon emergency food aid,,with about up to 250,000 dying. 
 This is a catastrophe waiting to happen again.,And it's one that gets very little attention.,In our accelerated media culture,,desertification is simply too slow,to reach the headlines.,It's nothing like a tsunami or a Katrina:,too few crying children and smashed up houses.,And yet desertification,is a major threat on all continents,,affecting some 110 countries,and about 70 percent of the world's agricultural drylands. 
 It seriously threatens the livelihoods,of millions of people,,and especially in Africa and China.,And it is largely an issue that we've created for ourselves,through unsustainable use of scarce resources.,So, we get climate change.,We get droughts,,increased desertification,,crashing food systems, water scarcity,,famine, forced migration,,political instability, warfare, crisis.,That's a potential scenario,if we fail to take this seriously.,But, how far away is it? 
 I went to Sokoto in northern Nigeria,to try and find out how far away it is.,The dunes here move southward at a pace of around 600 meters a year.,That's the Sahara eating up almost [two meters] a day of the arable land,,physically pushing people away from their homes.,Here I am -- I'm the second person on the left --,(Laughter),with the elders in Gidan-Kara,,a tiny village outside of Sokoto. 
 They had to move this village in 1987,as a huge dune threatened to swallow it.,So, they moved the entire village, hut by hut.,This is where the village used to be.,It took us about 10 minutes to climb up to the top of that dune,,which goes to show why they had to move to a safer location.,That's the kind of forced migration,that desertification can lead to.,If you happen to live close to the desert border,,you can pretty much calculate how long it will be,before you have to carry your kids away,,and abandon your home and your life as you know it. 
 Now, sand dunes cover only about one fifth of our deserts.,And still, those extreme environments are very good places,if we want to stop the shifting sands.,Four years ago, 23 African countries,came together to create the Great Green Wall Sahara.,A fantastic project, the initial plan,called for a shelter belt of trees to be planted,right across the African continent,,from Mauritania in the west, all the way to Djibouti in the east.,If you want to stop a sand dune from moving,,what you need to make sure to do is to stop the grains,from avalanching over its crest.,And a good way of doing that, the most efficient way,,is to use some kind of sand catcher.,Trees or cacti are good for this.,But, one of the problems with planting trees is that,the people in these regions are so poor,that they chop them down for firewood. 
 Now there is an alternative to just planting trees,and hoping that they won't get chopped down.,This sandstone wall that I'm proposing essentially does three things.,It adds roughness to the dune's surface,,to the texture of the dune's surface, binding the grains.,It provides a physical support structure for the trees,,and it creates physical spaces,,habitable spaces inside of the sand dunes.,If people live inside of the green barrier,they can help support the trees, protect them from humans,,and from some of the forces of nature.,Inside of the dunes we find shade.,We can start harvesting condensation,,and start greening the desert from within. 
 Sand dunes are almost like ready-made buildings in a way.,All we need to do is solidify the parts that we need to be solid,,and then excavate the sand,,and we have our architecture.,We can either excavate it by hand,or we can have the wind excavate it for us.,So, the wind carries the sand onto the site,and then it carries the redundant sand away from the structure for us. 
 But, by now, you're probably asking,,how am I planning to solidify a sand dune?,How do we glue those grains of sand together?,And the answer is, perhaps, that you use these guys,,Bacillus pasteurii,,a micro-organism that is readily available in wetlands,and marshes, and does precisely that.,It takes a pile of loose sand,and it creates sandstone out of it.,These images from the American Society for Microbiology show us the process. 
 What happens is, you pour Bacillus pasteurii onto a pile of sand,,and it starts filling up the voids in between the grains.,A chemical process produces calcite,,which is a kind of natural cement,that binds the grains together.,The whole cementation process takes about 24 hours.,I learned about this from a professor at U.C. Davis called Jason DeJong.,He managed to do it in a mere 1,400 minutes.,Here I am, playing the part of the mad scientist,,working with the bugs at UCL in London,,trying to solidify them. 
 So, how much would this cost?,I'm not an economist, very much not,,but I did, quite literally, a back of the envelope calculation --,(Laughter),-- and it seems that for a cubic meter of concrete,we would have to pay in the region of 90 dollars.,And, after an initial cost of 60 bucks to buy the bacteria,,which you'll never have to pay again,,one cubic meter of bacterial sand,would be about 11 dollars. 
 How do we construct something like this?,Well, I'll quickly show you two options.,The first is to create a kind of balloon structure,,fill it with bacteria, then allow the sand to wash over the balloon,,pop the balloon, as it were, disseminating the bacteria into the sand and solidifying it.,Then, a few years afterwards,,using permacultural strategies,,we green that part of the desert. 
 The second alternative would be to use injection piles.,So, we pushed the piles down through the dune,,and we create an initial bacterial surface.,We then pull the piles up through the dune,and we're able to create almost any conceivable shape inside of the sand,with the sand acting as a mold as we go up.,So, we have a way of turning sand into sandstone,,and then creating these habitable spaces inside of the desert dunes. 
 But, what should they look like?,Well, I was inspired, for my architectural form, by tafoni,,which look a little bit like this, this is a model representation of it.,These are cavernous rock structures that I found on the site in Sokoto.,And I realized that if I scaled them up, they would provide me,with good spatial qualities,,for ventilation, for thermal comfort, and for other things.,Now, part of the formal control over this structure,would be lost to nature, obviously,,as the bacteria do their work.,And I think this creates a kind of boundless beauty actually.,I think there is really something in that articulation,that is quite nice.,We see the result, the traces, if you like,,of the Bacillus pasteurii being harnessed to sculpt the desert,into these habitable environments. 
 Some people believe that,this would spread uncontrollably,,and that the bacteria would kill everything in its way.,That's not true at all.,It's a natural process. It goes on in nature today,,and the bacteria die as soon as we stop feeding them.,So, there it is --,architectural anti-desertification structures,made from the desert itself.,Sand-stopping devices, made from sand.,The world is likely to lose one third of its arable land,by the end of the century.,In a period of unprecedented population growth,and increased food demands, this could prove disastrous.,And quite frankly, we're putting our heads in the sand. 
 If nothing else, I would like for this scheme to initiate a discussion.,But, if I had something like a TED wish,,it would be to actually get it built,,to start building this habitable wall,,this very, very long, but very narrow city in the desert,,built into the dunescape itself.,It's not only something that supports trees,,but something that connects people and countries together.,I would like to conclude by showing you an animation of the structure,,and leave you with a sentence by Jorge Luis Borges. 
 Borges said that "nothing is built on stone,,everything is built on sand,,but we must build as if the sand were stone." 
 Now, there are many details left to explore in this scheme --,political, practical, ethical, financial.,My design, as it takes you down the rabbit hole,,is fraught with many challenges,and difficulties in the real world.,But, it's a beginning, it's a vision.,As Borges would have it, it's the sand.,And I think now is really the time,to turn it into stone. Thank you.,(Applause)Twenty-five-and-a-quarter years ago I read,a newspaper article which said,that one day syringes would be,one of the major causes of the spread of AIDS,,the transmission of AIDS.,I thought this was unacceptable. So I decided to do something about it. 
 Sadly, it's come true. Malaria, as we all know,,kills approximately one million people a year.,The reuse of syringes now exceeds that,and kills 1.3 million people a year.,This young girl and her friend,that I met in an orphanage in Delhi,were HIV positive from a syringe.,And what was so sad about this particular story,was that once their parents had found out --,and don't forget, their parents took them to the doctor --,the parents threw them out on the street.,And hence they ended up in an orphanage. 
 And it comes from situations like this where,you have either skilled or unskilled practitioners,,blindly giving an injection to someone.,And the injection is so valuable,,that the people basically trust,the doctor, being second to God, which I've heard many times,,to do the right thing. But in fact they're not.,And you can understand, obviously, the transmission problem,between people in high-virus areas. 
 This video we took undercover,,which shows you, over a half an hour period,,a tray of medicines of 42 vials,,which are being delivered with only 2 syringes in a public hospital in India.,And over the course of half an hour, not one syringe,was filmed being unwrapped.,They started with two and they ended with two.,And you'll see, just now, a nurse coming back to the tray,,which is their sort of modular station,,and dropping the syringe she's just used,back in the tray for it to be picked up and used again.,So you can imagine the scale of this problem.,And in fact in India alone, 62 percent,of all injections given,are unsafe. 
 These kids in Pakistan don't go to school.,They are lucky. They already have a job.,And that job is that they go around and pick up syringes,from the back of hospitals,,wash them, and in the course of this,,obviously picking them up they injure themselves.,And then they repackage them and sell them out on markets,for literally more money,than a sterile syringe in the first place, which is quite bizarre.,In an interesting photo, their father, while we were talking to him,,picked up a syringe and pricked his finger --,I don't know whether you can see the drop of blood on the end --,and immediately whipped out a box of matches,,lit one, and burned the blood off the end of his finger,,giving me full assurance,that that was the way that you stopped the transmission of HIV. 
 In China, recycling is a major issue.,And they are collected en mass -- you can see the scale of it here --,and sorted out, by hand, back into the right sizes,,and then put back out on the street.,So recycling and reuse,are the major issues here.,But there was one interesting anecdote that I found in Indonesia.,In all schools in Indonesia,,there is usually a toy seller in the playground.,The toy seller, in this case,,had syringes, which they usually do,,next door to the diggers, which is obviously,what you would expect.,And they use them, in the breaks, for water pistols.,They squirt them at each other, which is lovely and innocent.,And they are having great fun.,But they also drink from them,while they're in their breaks, because it's hot.,And they squirt the water into their mouths.,And these are used with traces of blood visible. 
 So we need a better product. And we need better information.,And I think, if I can just borrow this camera,,I was going to show you my invention,,which I came up with.,So, it's a normal-looking syringe.,You load it up in the normal way. This is made,on existing equipment in 14 factories that we license.,You give the injection and then put it down.,If someone then tries to reuse it,,it locks and breaks afterwards.,It's very, very simple. Thank you.,(Applause),And it costs the same as a normal syringe.,And in comparison, a Coca-Cola,is 10 times the price.,And that will stop reusing a syringe 20 or 30 times. 
 And I have an information charity,which has done huge scale amount of work in India.,And we're very proud of giving information to people,,so that little kids like this don't do stupid things.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)On the 30th of May, 1832,,a gunshot was heard,ringing out across the 13th arrondissement in Paris.,(Gunshot),A peasant, who was walking to market that morning,,ran towards where the gunshot had come from,,and found a young man writhing in agony on the floor,,clearly shot by a dueling wound.,The young man's name was Evariste Galois.,He was a well-known revolutionary in Paris at the time.,Galois was taken to the local hospital,where he died the next day in the arms of his brother.,And the last words he said to his brother were,,"Don't cry for me, Alfred.,I need all the courage I can muster,to die at the age of 20." 
 It wasn't, in fact, revolutionary politics,for which Galois was famous.,But a few years earlier, while still at school,,he'd actually cracked one of the big mathematical,problems at the time.,And he wrote to the academicians in Paris,,trying to explain his theory.,But the academicians couldn't understand anything that he wrote.,(Laughter),This is how he wrote most of his mathematics. 
 So, the night before that duel, he realized,this possibly is his last chance,to try and explain his great breakthrough.,So he stayed up the whole night, writing away,,trying to explain his ideas.,And as the dawn came up and he went to meet his destiny,,he left this pile of papers on the table for the next generation.,Maybe the fact that he stayed up all night doing mathematics,was the fact that he was such a bad shot that morning and got killed. 
 But contained inside those documents,was a new language, a language to understand,one of the most fundamental concepts,of science -- namely symmetry.,Now, symmetry is almost nature's language.,It helps us to understand so many,different bits of the scientific world.,For example, molecular structure.,What crystals are possible,,we can understand through the mathematics of symmetry. 
 In microbiology you really don't want to get a symmetrical object,,because they are generally rather nasty.,The swine flu virus, at the moment, is a symmetrical object.,And it uses the efficiency of symmetry,to be able to propagate itself so well.,But on a larger scale of biology, actually symmetry is very important,,because it actually communicates genetic information. 
 I've taken two pictures here and I've made them artificially symmetrical.,And if I ask you which of these you find more beautiful,,you're probably drawn to the lower two.,Because it is hard to make symmetry.,And if you can make yourself symmetrical, you're sending out a sign,that you've got good genes, you've got a good upbringing,and therefore you'll make a good mate.,So symmetry is a language which can help to communicate,genetic information. 
 Symmetry can also help us to explain,what's happening in the Large Hadron Collider in CERN.,Or what's not happening in the Large Hadron Collider in CERN.,To be able to make predictions about the fundamental particles,we might see there,,it seems that they are all facets of some strange symmetrical shape,in a higher dimensional space. 
 And I think Galileo summed up, very nicely,,the power of mathematics,to understand the scientific world around us.,He wrote, "The universe cannot be read,until we have learnt the language,and become familiar with the characters in which it is written.,It is written in mathematical language,,and the letters are triangles, circles and other geometric figures,,without which means it is humanly impossible,to comprehend a single word." 
 But it's not just scientists who are interested in symmetry.,Artists too love to play around with symmetry.,They also have a slightly more ambiguous relationship with it.,Here is Thomas Mann talking about symmetry in "The Magic Mountain.",He has a character describing the snowflake,,and he says he "shuddered at its perfect precision,,found it deathly, the very marrow of death." 
 But what artists like to do is to set up expectations,of symmetry and then break them.,And a beautiful example of this,I found, actually, when I visited a colleague of mine,in Japan, Professor Kurokawa.,And he took me up to the temples in Nikko.,And just after this photo was taken we walked up the stairs.,And the gateway you see behind,has eight columns, with beautiful symmetrical designs on them.,Seven of them are exactly the same,,and the eighth one is turned upside down. 
 And I said to Professor Kurokawa,,"Wow, the architects must have really been kicking themselves,when they realized that they'd made a mistake and put this one upside down.",And he said, "No, no, no. It was a very deliberate act.",And he referred me to this lovely quote from the Japanese,"Essays in Idleness" from the 14th century,,in which the essayist wrote, "In everything,,uniformity is undesirable.,Leaving something incomplete makes it interesting,,and gives one the feeling that there is room for growth.",Even when building the Imperial Palace,,they always leave one place unfinished. 
 But if I had to choose one building in the world,to be cast out on a desert island, to live the rest of my life,,being an addict of symmetry, I would probably choose the Alhambra in Granada.,This is a palace celebrating symmetry.,Recently I took my family --,we do these rather kind of nerdy mathematical trips, which my family love.,This is my son Tamer. You can see,he's really enjoying our mathematical trip to the Alhambra.,But I wanted to try and enrich him.,I think one of the problems about school mathematics,is it doesn't look at how mathematics is embedded,in the world we live in.,So, I wanted to open his eyes up to,how much symmetry is running through the Alhambra. 
 You see it already. Immediately you go in,,the reflective symmetry in the water.,But it's on the walls where all the exciting things are happening.,The Moorish artists were denied the possibility,to draw things with souls.,So they explored a more geometric art.,And so what is symmetry?,The Alhambra somehow asks all of these questions.,What is symmetry? When [there] are two of these walls,,do they have the same symmetries?,Can we say whether they discovered,all of the symmetries in the Alhambra? 
 And it was Galois who produced a language,to be able to answer some of these questions.,For Galois, symmetry -- unlike for Thomas Mann,,which was something still and deathly --,for Galois, symmetry was all about motion.,What can you do to a symmetrical object,,move it in some way, so it looks the same,as before you moved it?,I like to describe it as the magic trick moves.,What can you do to something? You close your eyes.,I do something, put it back down again.,It looks like it did before it started. 
 So, for example, the walls in the Alhambra --,I can take all of these tiles, and fix them at the yellow place,,rotate them by 90 degrees,,put them all back down again and they fit perfectly down there.,And if you open your eyes again, you wouldn't know that they'd moved.,But it's the motion that really characterizes the symmetry,inside the Alhambra.,But it's also about producing a language to describe this.,And the power of mathematics is often,to change one thing into another, to change geometry into language. 
 So I'm going to take you through, perhaps push you a little bit mathematically --,so brace yourselves --,push you a little bit to understand how this language works,,which enables us to capture what is symmetry.,So, let's take these two symmetrical objects here.,Let's take the twisted six-pointed starfish.,What can I do to the starfish which makes it look the same?,Well, there I rotated it by a sixth of a turn,,and still it looks like it did before I started.,I could rotate it by a third of a turn,,or a half a turn,,or put it back down on its image, or two thirds of a turn.,And a fifth symmetry, I can rotate it by five sixths of a turn.,And those are things that I can do to the symmetrical object,that make it look like it did before I started. 
 Now, for Galois, there was actually a sixth symmetry.,Can anybody think what else I could do to this,which would leave it like I did before I started?,I can't flip it because I've put a little twist on it, haven't I?,It's got no reflective symmetry.,But what I could do is just leave it where it is,,pick it up, and put it down again.,And for Galois this was like the zeroth symmetry.,Actually, the invention of the number zero,was a very modern concept, seventh century A.D., by the Indians.,It seems mad to talk about nothing.,And this is the same idea. This is a symmetrical --,so everything has symmetry, where you just leave it where it is. 
 So, this object has six symmetries.,And what about the triangle?,Well, I can rotate by a third of a turn clockwise,or a third of a turn anticlockwise.,But now this has some reflectional symmetry.,I can reflect it in the line through X,,or the line through Y,,or the line through Z.,Five symmetries and then of course the zeroth symmetry,where I just pick it up and leave it where it is.,So both of these objects have six symmetries.,Now, I'm a great believer that mathematics is not a spectator sport,,and you have to do some mathematics,in order to really understand it. 
 So here is a little question for you.,And I'm going to give a prize at the end of my talk,for the person who gets closest to the answer.,The Rubik's Cube.,How many symmetries does a Rubik's Cube have?,How many things can I do to this object,and put it down so it still looks like a cube?,Okay? So I want you to think about that problem as we go on,,and count how many symmetries there are.,And there will be a prize for the person who gets closest at the end. 
 But let's go back down to symmetries that I got for these two objects.,What Galois realized: it isn't just the individual symmetries,,but how they interact with each other,which really characterizes the symmetry of an object.,If I do one magic trick move followed by another,,the combination is a third magic trick move.,And here we see Galois starting to develop,a language to see the substance,of the things unseen, the sort of abstract idea,of the symmetry underlying this physical object.,For example, what if I turn the starfish,by a sixth of a turn,,and then a third of a turn? 
 So I've given names. The capital letters, A, B, C, D, E, F,,are the names for the rotations.,B, for example, rotates the little yellow dot,to the B on the starfish. And so on.,So what if I do B, which is a sixth of a turn,,followed by C, which is a third of a turn?,Well let's do that. A sixth of a turn,,followed by a third of a turn,,the combined effect is as if I had just rotated it by half a turn in one go.,So the little table here records,how the algebra of these symmetries work.,I do one followed by another, the answer is,it's rotation D, half a turn.,What I if I did it in the other order? Would it make any difference?,Let's see. Let's do the third of the turn first, and then the sixth of a turn.,Of course, it doesn't make any difference.,It still ends up at half a turn. 
 And there is some symmetry here in the way the symmetries interact with each other.,But this is completely different to the symmetries of the triangle.,Let's see what happens if we do two symmetries,with the triangle, one after the other.,Let's do a rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise,,and reflect in the line through X.,Well, the combined effect is as if I had just done the reflection in the line through Z,to start with.,Now, let's do it in a different order.,Let's do the reflection in X first,,followed by the rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise.,The combined effect, the triangle ends up somewhere completely different.,It's as if it was reflected in the line through Y. 
 Now it matters what order you do the operations in.,And this enables us to distinguish,why the symmetries of these objects --,they both have six symmetries. So why shouldn't we say,they have the same symmetries?,But the way the symmetries interact,enable us -- we've now got a language,to distinguish why these symmetries are fundamentally different.,And you can try this when you go down to the pub, later on.,Take a beer mat and rotate it by a quarter of a turn,,then flip it. And then do it in the other order,,and the picture will be facing in the opposite direction. 
 Now, Galois produced some laws for how these tables -- how symmetries interact.,It's almost like little Sudoku tables.,You don't see any symmetry twice,in any row or column.,And, using those rules, he was able to say,that there are in fact only two objects,with six symmetries.,And they'll be the same as the symmetries of the triangle,,or the symmetries of the six-pointed starfish.,I think this is an amazing development.,It's almost like the concept of number being developed for symmetry.,In the front here, I've got one, two, three people,sitting on one, two, three chairs.,The people and the chairs are very different,,but the number, the abstract idea of the number, is the same. 
 And we can see this now: we go back to the walls in the Alhambra.,Here are two very different walls,,very different geometric pictures.,But, using the language of Galois,,we can understand that the underlying abstract symmetries of these things,are actually the same.,For example, let's take this beautiful wall,with the triangles with a little twist on them.,You can rotate them by a sixth of a turn,if you ignore the colors. We're not matching up the colors.,But the shapes match up if I rotate by a sixth of a turn,around the point where all the triangles meet.,What about the center of a triangle? I can rotate,by a third of a turn around the center of the triangle,,and everything matches up.,And then there is an interesting place halfway along an edge,,where I can rotate by 180 degrees.,And all the tiles match up again.,So rotate along halfway along the edge, and they all match up. 
 Now, let's move to the very different-looking wall in the Alhambra.,And we find the same symmetries here, and the same interaction.,So, there was a sixth of a turn. A third of a turn where the Z pieces meet.,And the half a turn is halfway between the six pointed stars.,And although these walls look very different,,Galois has produced a language to say,that in fact the symmetries underlying these are exactly the same.,And it's a symmetry we call 6-3-2. 
 Here is another example in the Alhambra.,This is a wall, a ceiling, and a floor.,They all look very different. But this language allows us to say,that they are representations of the same symmetrical abstract object,,which we call 4-4-2. Nothing to do with football,,but because of the fact that there are two places where you can rotate,by a quarter of a turn, and one by half a turn. 
 Now, this power of the language is even more,,because Galois can say,,"Did the Moorish artists discover all of the possible symmetries,on the walls in the Alhambra?",And it turns out they almost did.,You can prove, using Galois' language,,there are actually only 17,different symmetries that you can do in the walls in the Alhambra.,And they, if you try to produce a different wall with this 18th one,,it will have to have the same symmetries as one of these 17. 
 But these are things that we can see.,And the power of Galois' mathematical language,is it also allows us to create,symmetrical objects in the unseen world,,beyond the two-dimensional, three-dimensional,,all the way through to the four- or five- or infinite-dimensional space.,And that's where I work. I create,mathematical objects, symmetrical objects,,using Galois' language,,in very high dimensional spaces.,So I think it's a great example of things unseen,,which the power of mathematical language allows you to create. 
 So, like Galois, I stayed up all last night,creating a new mathematical symmetrical object for you,,and I've got a picture of it here.,Well, unfortunately it isn't really a picture. If I could have my board,at the side here, great, excellent.,Here we are. Unfortunately, I can't show you,a picture of this symmetrical object.,But here is the language which describes,how the symmetries interact. 
 Now, this new symmetrical object,does not have a name yet.,Now, people like getting their names on things,,on craters on the moon,or new species of animals.,So I'm going to give you the chance to get your name on a new symmetrical object,which hasn't been named before.,And this thing -- species die away,,and moons kind of get hit by meteors and explode --,but this mathematical object will live forever.,It will make you immortal.,In order to win this symmetrical object,,what you have to do is to answer the question I asked you at the beginning.,How many symmetries does a Rubik's Cube have? 
 Okay, I'm going to sort you out.,Rather than you all shouting out, I want you to count how many digits there are,in that number. Okay?,If you've got it as a factorial, you've got to expand the factorials.,Okay, now if you want to play,,I want you to stand up, okay?,If you think you've got an estimate for how many digits,,right -- we've already got one competitor here.,If you all stay down he wins it automatically.,Okay. Excellent. So we've got four here, five, six.,Great. Excellent. That should get us going. All right. 
 Anybody with five or less digits, you've got to sit down,,because you've underestimated.,Five or less digits. So, if you're in the tens of thousands you've got to sit down.,60 digits or more, you've got to sit down.,You've overestimated.,20 digits or less, sit down.,How many digits are there in your number?,Two? So you should have sat down earlier.,(Laughter),Let's have the other ones, who sat down during the 20, up again. Okay?,If I told you 20 or less, stand up.,Because this one. I think there were a few here.,The people who just last sat down. 
 Okay, how many digits do you have in your number?,(Laughs),21. Okay good. How many do you have in yours?,18. So it goes to this lady here.,21 is the closest.,It actually has -- the number of symmetries in the Rubik's cube,has 25 digits.,So now I need to name this object.,So, what is your name?,I need your surname. Symmetrical objects generally --,spell it for me.,G-H-E-Z,No, SO2 has already been used, actually,,in the mathematical language. So you can't have that one.,So Ghez, there we go. That's your new symmetrical object.,You are now immortal.,(Applause) 
 And if you'd like your own symmetrical object,,I have a project raising money for a charity in Guatemala,,where I will stay up all night and devise an object for you,,for a donation to this charity to help kids get into education in Guatemala.,And I think what drives me, as a mathematician,,are those things which are not seen, the things that we haven't discovered.,It's all the unanswered questions which make mathematics a living subject.,And I will always come back to this quote from the Japanese "Essays in Idleness":,"In everything, uniformity is undesirable.,Leaving something incomplete makes it interesting,,and gives one the feeling that there is room for growth." Thank you.,(Applause)So, 120 years ago,,Dr. Röntgen X-rayed his wife's hand.,Quite why he had to pin her fingers to the floor,with her brooch, I'm not sure. It seems a bit extreme to me.,That image was the start of the X-ray technology.,And I'm still fundamentally using the same principles today.,I'm interpreting it in a more contemporary manner. 
 The first shot I ever did,was of a soda can, which was to promote a brand that we all know,,so I'm not going to do them any favors by showing you it.,But the second shot I did was my shoes I was wearing on the day.,And I do really like this shot, because,it shows all the detritus that's sort of embedded,in the sole of the sneakers.,It was just one of those pot-luck things where you,get it right first time. 
 Moving on to something a bit larger,,this is an X-ray of a bus.,And the bus is full of people.,It's actually the same person. It's just one skeleton.,And back in the '60s,,they used to teach student radiographers,to take X-rays, thankfully not on you and I,,but on dead people.,So, I've still got access to one of these dead people,called Frieda; she's falling apart, I'm afraid,,because she's very old and fragile.,But everyone on that bus is Frieda.,And the bus is taken with a cargo-scanning X-ray,,which is the sort of machine you have on borders,,which checks for contraband and drugs and bombs and things. 
 Fairly obvious what that is.,So, using large-scale objects,does sort of create drama,because you just don't see X-rays of big things that often.,Technology is moving ahead,,and these large cargo scanner X-rays,that work with the digital system are getting better and better and better.,Again though, to make it come alive,you need, somehow, to add the human element.,And I think the reason this image works, again, is because,Frieda is driving the bulldozer.,(Laughter) 
 Quite a difficult brief,,make a pair of men's pants look beautiful.,But I think the process, in itself, shows how exquisite they are.,Fashion -- now, I'm sort of anti-fashion because I,don't show the surface, I show what's within.,So, the fashionistas don't really like me,because it doesn't matter if Kate Moss is wearing it or if I'm wearing it,,it looks the same.,(Laughter),We all look the same inside, believe me.,The creases in the material and the sort of nuances.,And I show things for really what they are, what they're made of.,I peel back the layers and expose it.,And if it's well made I show it, if it's badly made I show it. 
 And I'm sure Ross can associate that with design.,The design comes from within.,It's not just Topshop,,I get some strange looks when I go out getting my props.,Here I was fumbling around in the ladies' underwear department,of a department store, almost got escorted from the premises.,I live opposite a farm. And this was the runt of the litter, a piglet that died.,And what's really interesting is,,if you look at the legs, you'll notice that the bones haven't fused.,And should that pig have grown,,unfortunately it was dead, it would have certainly been dead,after I X-rayed it, with the amount of radiation I used anyway.,(Laughter),But once the bones had fused together,it would have been healthy. 
 So, that's an empty parka jacket.,But I quite love the way it's posed.,Nature is my greatest inspiration.,And to carry on with a theme that we've already touched with,is how nature is related to architecture.,If you look at the roof of the Eden Project,,or the British library, it's all this honeycomb structure.,And I'm sure those architects are inspired,,as I am, by what surrounds us, by nature.,This, in fact, is a Victoria water lily leaf,that floats on the top of a pond.,An amaryllis flower looking really three-dimensional.,Seaweed, ebbing in the tide.,Now, how do I do this, and where do I do this, and all of that sort of thing. 
 This is my new, purpose-built, X-ray shed.,And the door to my X-ray room,is made of lead and steel.,It weighs 1,250 kilograms and the only exercise I get is opening and closing it.,(Laughter),The walls are 700 millimeters thick of solid dense concrete.,So, I'm using quite a lot of radiation.,A lot more than you'd get in a hospital or a vet's.,And there I am. This is a quite high-powered X-ray machine.,What's interesting really about X-ray really,is, if you think about it, is that that technology,is used for looking for cancer or looking for drugs,,or looking for contraband or whatever.,And I use that sort of technology,to create things that are quite beautiful. 
 So, still working with film, I'm afraid.,Technology in X-ray where it's life-size processed,,apart from these large cargo-scanning machines,,hasn't moved on enough for the quality of the image,and the resolution to be good enough for what I want to do with it,,which is show my pictures big.,So, I have to use a 1980s drum scanner,,which was designed in the days when everyone shot photographs on film.,They scan each individual X-ray.,And this shows how I do my process of same-size X-rays.,So, this is, again, my daughter's dress.,Still has the tag in it from me buying it,,so I can take it back to the shop if she didn't like it.,But there are four X-ray plates.,You can see them overlapping. 
 So, when you move forward from something fairly small,,a dress which is this size,,onto something like that which is done in exactly the same process,,you can see that that is a lot of work.,In fact, that is three months solid X-raying.,There is over 500 separate components.,Boeing sent me a 747 in containers.,And I sent them back an X-ray.,(Laughter) I kid you not. 
 Okay, so Frieda is my dead skeleton.,This, unfortunately, is basically two pictures.,One on the extreme right is a photograph of an American footballer.,The one on the left is an x-ray.,But this time I had to use a real body.,Because I needed all the skin tissue to make it look real,,to make it look like it was a real athlete.,So, here I had to use a recently deceased body.,And getting a hold of that was extremely difficult and laborious.,But people do donate their bodies to art and science.,And when they do, I'm in the queue.,So, I like to use them.,(Laughter) 
 The coloring, so coloring adds another level to the X-rays.,It makes it more organic, more natural.,It's whatever takes my fancy, really.,It's not accurately colored to how it is in real life.,That flower doesn't come in bright orange, I don't think.,But I just like it in bright orange.,And also with something technical, like these are DJ decks,,it sort of adds another level.,It makes a two dimensional image look more three dimensional. 
 The most difficult things to X-ray,,the most technically challenging things to X-ray,are the lightest things, the most delicate things.,To get the detail in a feather,,believe me, if there is anyone out here who knows anything about X-rays,,that's quite a challenge.,I'm now going to show you a short film, I'll step to the side. 
 Video: (Music),The thing in there is very dangerous.,If you touch that, you could possibly die,through radiation poisoning.,In my career I've had two exposures to radiation,,which is two too many, because it stays with you for life.,It's cumulative. 
 (Music),It has human connotations.,The fact that it's a child's toy that we all recognize,,but also it looks like it's a robot,,and it comes from a sci-fi genus.,It's a surprise that it has humanity,,but also man-made, future, alien associations.,And it's just a bit spooky. 
 (Music),The bus was done with a cargo-scanning X-ray machine,,which is used on the borders,between countries, looking for contraband and illegal immigrants.,The lorry goes in front of it. And it takes slices,of X-rays through the lorry.,And that's how this was done. It's actually slice, slice.,It's a bit like a CT scanner in a hospital. Slices.,And then if you look carefully, there is all little things.,He's got headphones on, reading the newspaper,,got a hat on, glasses, got a bag.,So, these little details,help to make it work, make it real. 
 (Music),The problem with using living people is that,to take an X-ray, if I X-ray you, you get exposed to radiation.,So, to avoid that --,I have to avoid it somehow --,is I use dead people.,Now, that's a variety of things, from recently deceased bodies,,to a skeleton that was used by student radiographers,to train in taking X-rays of the human body,,at different densities. 
 (Music),I have very high-tech equipment of gloves, scissors and a bucket. 
 (Music),I will show how the capillary action works, how it feeds,,I'll be able to get all the cells inside that stem.,Because it transfers food from its roots to its leaves.,Look at this monster. 
 (Music),It's so basic. It just grows wild.,That's what I really like about it,,the fact that I haven't got to go and buy it,,and it hasn't been genetically modified at all.,It's just happening.,And the X-ray shows how beautiful nature can be.,Not that that is particularly beautiful,when you look at it with the human eye,,the way the leaves form. They're curling back on each other.,So the X-ray will show the overlaps in these little corners.,The thicker the object, the more radiation it needs,,and the more time it needs.,The lighter the object, the less radiation.,Sometimes you keep the time up, because the time gives you detail.,The longer the exposure goes on for,,the more detail you get. 
 (Music),If you look at this, just the tube,,it is quite bright.,But I could get a bit darker in the tube, but everything else would suffer.,So, these leaves at the edge would start to disappear.,What I like is how hard the edges are,,how sharp.,Yeah, I'm quite pleased with it. 
 (Music),I travel beyond the surface and show,something for what it's worth,,for what it's really made of, how it really works.,But also I find that,I've got the benefit of taking away all the surface,,which is things that people are used to seeing. 
 And that's the sort of thing I've been doing.,I've got the opportunity now to show you,what I'm going to be doing in the future.,This is a commercial application of my most recent work.,And what's good about this, I think, is that it's like a moment in time,,like you've turned around, you've got X-ray vision,and you've taken a picture with the X-ray camera.,Unfortunately I haven't got X-ray vision.,I do dream in X-ray. I see my projects in my sleep.,And I know what they're going to look like in X-ray and I'm not far off. 
 So, what am I doing in the future?,Well, this year is the 50th anniversary,of Issigonis's Mini, which is one of my favorite cars.,So, I've taken it apart, component by component,,months and months and months of work.,And with this image, I'm going to be displaying,it in the Victoria and Albert Museum,as a light box, which is actually attached to the car.,So, I've got to saw the car in half, down the middle,,not an easy task, in itself.,And then, so you can get in the driver's side, sit down,,and up against you is a wall.,And if you get out and walk around to the other side of the car,,you see a life-sized light box of the car showing you how it works. 
 And I'm going to take that idea,and apply it to other sort of iconic things from my life.,Like, my first computer was a big movement in my life.,And I had a Mac Classic. And it's a little box.,And I think that would look quite neat as an X-ray.,I'm also looking to,take my work from the two-dimensional form,to a more three-dimensional form.,And this is quite a good way of doing it.,I'm also working now with X-ray video.,So, if you can imagine, some of these flowers,,and they're actually moving and growing,and you can film that in X-ray, should be quite stunning.,But that's it. I'm done. Thank you very much.,(Applause)All buildings today have something in common.,They're made using Victorian technologies.,This involves blueprints,,industrial manufacturing,and construction using teams of workers.,All of this effort results in an inert object.,And that means that there is a one-way transfer of energy,from our environment into our homes and cities.,This is not sustainable.,I believe that the only way that it is possible for us,to construct genuinely sustainable homes and cities,is by connecting them to nature,,not insulating them from it. 
 Now, in order to do this, we need the right kind of language.,Living systems are in constant conversation,with the natural world,,through sets of chemical reactions called metabolism.,And this is the conversion of one group of substances,into another, either through,the production or the absorption of energy.,And this is the way in which living materials,make the most of their local resources,in a sustainable way.,So, I'm interested in the use of,metabolic materials for the practice of architecture.,But they don't exist. So I'm having to make them. 
 I'm working with architect Neil Spiller,at the Bartlett School of Architecture,,and we're collaborating with international scientists,in order to generate these new materials,from a bottom up approach.,That means we're generating them from scratch.,One of our collaborators is chemist Martin Hanczyc,,and he's really interested in the transition from,inert to living matter.,Now, that's exactly the kind of process that I'm interested in,,when we're thinking about sustainable materials. 
 So, Martin, he works with a system called the protocell.,Now all this is -- and it's magic --,is a little fatty bag. And it's got a chemical battery in it.,And it has no DNA.,This little bag is able to conduct itself,in a way that can only be described as living.,It is able to move around its environment.,It can follow chemical gradients.,It can undergo complex reactions,,some of which are happily architectural.,So here we are. These are protocells,,patterning their environment.,We don't know how they do that yet.,Here, this is a protocell, and it's vigorously shedding this skin.,Now, this looks like a chemical kind of birth.,This is a violent process. 
 Here, we've got a protocell to extract carbon dioxide,out of the atmosphere,and turn it into carbonate.,And that's the shell around that globular fat.,They are quite brittle. So you've only got a part of one there.,So what we're trying to do is, we're trying to push these technologies,towards creating bottom-up construction approaches,for architecture,,which contrast the current, Victorian, top-down methods,which impose structure upon matter.,That can't be energetically sensible. 
 So, bottom-up materials,actually exist today.,They've been in use, in architecture, since ancient times.,If you walk around the city of Oxford, where we are today,,and have a look at the brickwork,,which I've enjoyed doing in the last couple of days,,you'll actually see that a lot of it is made of limestone.,And if you look even closer,,you'll see, in that limestone, there are little shells,and little skeletons that are piled upon each other.,And then they are fossilized over millions of years. 
 Now a block of limestone, in itself,,isn't particularly that interesting.,It looks beautiful.,But imagine what the properties of this limestone block might be,if the surfaces were actually,in conversation with the atmosphere.,Maybe they could extract carbon dioxide.,Would it give this block of limestone new properties?,Well, most likely it would. It might be able to grow.,It might be able to self-repair, and even respond,to dramatic changes,in the immediate environment. 
 So, architects are never happy,with just one block of an interesting material.,They think big. Okay?,So when we think about scaling up metabolic materials,,we can start thinking about ecological interventions,like repair of atolls,,or reclamation of parts of a city,that are damaged by water.,So, one of these examples,would of course be the historic city of Venice.,Now, Venice, as you know, has a tempestuous relationship with the sea,,and is built upon wooden piles.,So we've devised a way by which it may be possible,for the protocell technology that we're working with,to sustainably reclaim Venice.,And architect Christian Kerrigan,has come up with a series of designs that show us,how it may be possible to actually grow a limestone reef,underneath the city. 
 So, here is the technology we have today.,This is our protocell technology,,effectively making a shell, like its limestone forefathers,,and depositing it in a very complex environment,,against natural materials.,We're looking at crystal lattices to see the bonding process in this.,Now, this is the very interesting part.,We don't just want limestone dumped everywhere in all the pretty canals.,What we need it to do is to be,creatively crafted around the wooden piles. 
 So, you can see from these diagrams that the protocell is actually,moving away from the light,,toward the dark foundations.,We've observed this in the laboratory.,The protocells can actually move away from the light.,They can actually also move towards the light. You have to just choose your species.,So that these don't just exist as one entity,,we kind of chemically engineer them.,And so here the protocells are depositing their limestone,very specifically, around the foundations of Venice,,effectively petrifying it. 
 Now, this isn't going to happen tomorrow. It's going to take a while.,It's going to take years of tuning and monitoring this technology,in order for us to become ready,to test it out in a case-by-case basis,on the most damaged and stressed buildings within the city of Venice.,But gradually, as the buildings are repaired,,we will see the accretion of a limestone reef beneath the city.,An accretion itself is a huge sink of carbon dioxide.,Also it will attract the local marine ecology,,who will find their own ecological niches within this architecture. 
 So, this is really interesting. Now we have an architecture,that connects a city to the natural world,in a very direct and immediate way.,But perhaps the most exciting thing about it,is that the driver of this technology is available everywhere.,This is terrestrial chemistry. We've all got it,,which means that this technology is just as appropriate,for developing countries as it is,for First World countries.,So, in summary, I'm generating metabolic materials,as a counterpoise to Victorian technologies,,and building architectures from a bottom-up approach. 
 Secondly, these metabolic materials,have some of the properties of living systems,,which means they can perform in similar ways.,They can expect to have a lot of forms and functions,within the practice of architecture.,And finally, an observer in the future,marveling at a beautiful structure in the environment,may find it almost impossible to tell,whether this structure,has been created by a natural process,or an artificial one.,Thank you.,(Applause)I'd like to talk to you todaynabout the scale of the scientific effort,that goes into making the headlinesnyou see in the paper.,Headlines that look like thisnwhen they have to do with climate change;,and like this when they have to donwith air quality or smog.,They're two branches of the same fieldnof atmospheric science. 
 Recently, the headlines looked like this,when the Intergovernmental Panelnon Climate Change, or IPCC,,put out their report,on the state of understandingnof the atmospheric system.,That report was writtennby 620 scientists from 40 countries.,They wrote almostn1,000 pages on the topic,,and all of those pages were reviewed,by another 400-plusnscientists and reviewers,from 113 countries.,It's a big community;,such a big community, in fact,,that our annual gathering is the largestnscientific meeting in the world. 
 Over 15,000 scientists gonto San Francisco every year for that.,Every one of those scientistsnis in a research group,,and every research group studiesna wide variety of topics.,For us at Cambridge, it's as variednas the El Niño Oscillation,,which affects weather and climate,,to the assimilation of satellite data,,to emissions from crops that producenbiofuels, which is what I study. 
 And in each one of these research areas,nof which there are even more,,there are PhD students, like me,nand we study incredibly narrow topics,,things as narrow as a few processesnor a few molecules.,And one of the molecules I studynis called isoprene, which is here.,It's a small organic molecule.,You've probably never heard of it.,The weight of a paper clipnis approximately equal,to 900 zeta-illion -- 10 to the 21st --nmolecules of isoprene. 
 But despite its very small weight,,enough of it is emittedninto the atmosphere every year,to equal the weightnof all the people on the planet.,It's a huge amount of stuff.nIt's equal to the weight of methane.,And because it's so much stuff,,it's really importantnfor the atmospheric system. 
 Because it's importantnto the atmospheric system,,we go to all lengths to study this thing.,We blow it up and look at the pieces.,This is the EUPHORE Smog Chamber in Spain.,Atmospheric explosions,nor full combustion,,takes about 15,000 times longernthan what happens in your car.,But still, we look at the pieces. 
 We run enormous models on supercomputers;nthis is what I happen to do.,Our models have hundredsnof thousands of grid boxes,calculating hundreds of variablesneach, on minute timescales.,It takes weeks to performnour integrations,,and we perform dozens of integrationsnin order to understand what's happening. 
 We also fly all over the worldnlooking for this thing.,I recently joined a field campaignnin Malaysia -- there are others.,We found a global atmosphericnwatchtower there,in the middle of the rainforest,,and hung hundreds of thousandsnof dollars' worth of scientific equipment,off this tower,,to look for isoprene and other thingsnwhile we were there.,This is the tower in the middlenof the rainforest from above,,and the tower from below. 
 On part of that field campaignnwe even brought an aircraft with us.,And this plane, the model BAe-146,nwhich was run by FAAM,,normally flies 120 to 130 people,,so maybe you took a similar aircraftnto get here today.,But we didn't just fly it.,We were flying at 100 metersnabove the top of the canopy,to measure this molecule --nincredibly dangerous stuff. 
 We have to fly at a special inclinento make the measurements;,we hire military and test pilotsnto do the maneuvering;,we need special flight clearance.,As you come around the banksnin these valleys,,the forces can get up to two Gs;,the scientists must bencompletely harnessed in,in order to make measurementsnwhile on board.,So as you can imagine,,the inside of the aircraft doesn't looknlike one you'd take on vacation.,It's a flying laboratory we tooknto make measurements of this molecule. 
 We do all this to understandnthe chemistry of one molecule.,And when one student like menhas some sort of inclination,or understanding about that molecule,,they write one scientific papernon the subject.,And out of that field campaignnwe'll probably get a few dozen papers,on a few dozen processes or molecules. 
 As a body of knowledge builds up,nit will form one subsection,,or one sub-subsection,,of an assessment like the IPCC,nalthough we have others.,And each one of the 11 chaptersnof the IPCC has six to ten subsections.,So you can imaginenthe scale of the effort.,In each one of the assessments we write,nwe always tag on a summary,,and the summary is writtennfor a non-scientific audience.,And we hand that summarynto journalists and policy makers,in order to make headlines like these. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)As a culture, we tell ourselves lots of stories,about the future,,and where we might move forward from this point.,Some of those stories are that,somebody is just going to sort everything out for us.,Other stories are that everything is on the verge of unraveling. 
 But I want to tell you a different story here today.,Like all stories, it has a beginning.,My work, for a long time, has been involved in education,,in teaching people practical skills,for sustainability,,teaching people how to take responsibility,for growing some of their own food,,how to build buildings using local materials,,how to generate their own energy, and so on. 
 I lived in Ireland, built the first straw-bale houses in Ireland,,and some cob buildings and all this kind of thing.,But all my work for many years was focused,around the idea that sustainability,means basically looking at,the globalized economic growth model,,and moderating what comes in at one end,,and moderating the outputs at the other end.,And then I came into contact with a way of looking at things,which actually changed that profoundly. 
 And in order to introduce you to that,,I've got something here that I'm going to unveil,,which is one of the great marvels of the modern age.,And it's something so astounding and so astonishing,that I think maybe as I remove this cloth,a suitable gasp of amazement might be appropriate.,If you could help me with that it would be fantastic.,(Laughter),This is a liter of oil. 
 This bottle of oil,,distilled over a hundred million years of geological time,,ancient sunlight,,contains the energy equivalent of about five weeks,hard human manual labor --,equivalent to about 35 strong people,coming round and working for you.,We can turn it into a dazzling array of materials,,medicine, modern clothing,,laptops, a whole range of different things.,It gives us an energy return that's unimaginable, historically.,We've based the design of our settlements,,our business models, our transport plans,,even the idea of economic growth, some would argue,,on the assumption that we will have this in perpetuity. 
 Yet, when we take a step back,,and look over the span of history,,at what we might call the petroleum interval,,it's a short period in history,where we've discovered this extraordinary material,,and then based a whole way of life around it.,But as we straddle the top of this energy mountain, at this stage,,we move from a time where our economic success,,our sense of individual prowess and well-being,is directly linked to how much of this we consume,,to a time when actually our degree of oil dependency,is our degree of vulnerability. 
 And it's increasingly clear that we,aren't going to be able to rely on the fact that,we're going to have this at our disposal forever.,For every four barrels of oil that we consume,,we only discover one.,And that gap continues to widen.,There is also the fact that the amount of energy,that we get back from the oil that we discover is falling.,In the 1930s we got 100 units of energy back,for every one that we put in to extract it.,Completely unprecedented, historically.,Already that's fallen to about 11.,And that's why, now,,the new breakthroughs, the new frontiers,in terms of oil extraction are scrambling about in Alberta,,or at the bottom of the oceans. 
 There are 98 oil-producing nations in the world.,But of those, 65 have already passed their peak.,The moment when the world on average passes this peak,,people wonder when that's going to happen.,And there is an emerging case,that maybe that was what happened last July,when the oil prices were so high. 
 But are we to assume that the same brilliance,and creativity and adaptability,that got us up to the top of that energy mountain in the first place,is somehow mysteriously going to evaporate,when we have to design a creative way back down the other side?,No. But the thinking that we have to come up with,has to be based on a realistic assessment,of where we are. 
 There is also the issue of climate change,,is the other thing that underpins this transition approach.,But the thing that I notice, as I talk to climate scientists,,is the increasingly terrified look they have in their eyes,,as the data that's coming in,,which is far ahead of what the IPCC are talking about.,So the IPCC said,that we might see significant breakup,of the arctic ice in 2100, in their worst case scenario.,Actually, if current trends continue,,it could all be gone in five or 10 years' time.,If just three percent of the carbon locked up in the arctic permafrost,is released as the world warms,,it would offset all the savings that we need to make,,in carbon, over the next 40 years to avoid runaway climate change.,We have no choice other than deep and urgent decarbonization. 
 But I'm always very interested to think about,what might the stories be,that the generations further down the slope from us,are going to tell about us.,"The generation that lived at the top of the mountain,,that partied so hard, and so abused its inheritance.",And one of the ways I like to do that,is to look back at the stories people used to tell,before we had cheap oil, before we had fossil fuels,,and people relied on their own muscle, animal muscle energy,,or a little bit of wind, little bit of water energy. 
 We had stories like "The Seven-League Boots":,the giant who had these boots, where, once you put them on,,with every stride you could cover seven leagues, or 21 miles,,a kind of travel completely unimaginable,to people without that kind of energy at their disposal. 
 Stories like The Magic Porridge Pot,,where you had a pot where if you knew the magic words,,this pot would just make as much food as you liked,,without you having to do any work,,provided you could remember the other magic word to stop it making porridge.,Otherwise you'd flood your entire town with warm porridge. 
 There is the story of "The Elves and the Shoemaker.",The people who make shoes go to sleep, wake up in the morning,,and all the shoes are magically made for them.,It's something that was unimaginable to people then. 
 Now we have the seven-league boots,in the form of Ryanair and Easyjet.,We have the magic porridge pot,in the form of Walmart and Tesco.,And we have the elves in the form of China.,But we don't appreciate what an astonishing,thing that has been. 
 And what are the stories that we tell ourselves now,,as we look forward about where we're going to go.,And I would argue that there are four. There is the idea of business as usual,,that the future will be like the present, just more of it.,But as we've seen over the last year, I think that's an idea,that is increasingly coming into question.,And in terms of climate change,,is something that is not actually feasible. 
 There is the idea of hitting the wall,,that actually somehow everything is so fragile,that it might just all unravel and collapse.,This is a popular story in some places.,The third story is the idea that technology can solve everything,,that technology can somehow get us through this completely. 
 And it's an idea that I think is very prevalent at these TED Talks,,the idea that we can invent our way out of a profound,economic and energy crisis,,that a move to a knowledge economy,can somehow neatly sidestep those energy constraints,,the idea that we'll discover some fabulous new source of energy,that will mean we can sweep all concerns,about energy security to one side,,the idea that we can step off neatly,onto a completely renewable world. 
 But the world isn't Second Life.,We can't create new land and new energy systems at the click of a mouse.,And as we sit, exchanging free ideas with each other,,there are still people mining coal,in order to power the servers, extracting the minerals,to make all of those things.,The breakfast that we eat as we sit down,to check our email in the morning,is still transported at great distances,,usually at the expense of the local, more resilient,food systems that would have supplied that in the past,,which we've so effectively devalued and dismantled. 
 We can be astonishingly inventive and creative.,But we also live in a world with very real constraints and demands.,Energy and technology are not the same thing.,What I'm involved with is the transition response.,And this is really about looking the challenges,of peak oil and climate change square in the face,,and responding with a creativity and an adaptability,and an imagination that we really need.,It's something which has spread incredibly fast.,And it is something which has several characteristics. 
 It's viral. It seems to spread under the radar very, very quickly.,It's open source. It's something which everybody who's involved with it,develops and passes on as they work with it.,It's self-organizing. There is no great central organization,that pushes this; people just pick up an idea,and they run with it, and they implement it where they are.,It's solutions-focused. It's very much looking at what people can do,where they are, to respond to this.,It's sensitive to place and to scale. 
 Transitional is completely different.,Transition groups in Chile, transition groups in the U.S., transition groups here,,what they're doing looks very different in every place that you go to.,It learns very much from its mistakes.,And it feels historic. It tries to create a sense,that this is a historic opportunity,to do something really extraordinary.,And it's a process which is really joyful.,People have a huge amount of fun doing this,,reconnecting with other people as they do it.,One of the things that underpins it is this idea of resilience. 
 And I think, in many ways, the idea of resilience,is a more useful concept than the idea of sustainability.,The idea of resilience comes from the study of ecology.,And it's really about how systems,,settlements, withstand shock from the outside.,When they encounter shock from the outside,that they don't just unravel and fall to pieces.,And I think it's a more useful concept than sustainability, as I said. 
 When our supermarkets have only two or three days' worth of food in them,at any one time, often sustainability tends to focus on,the energy efficiency of the freezers,and on the packaging that the lettuces are wrapped up in.,Looking through the lens of resilience,,we really question how we've let ourselves get into a situation,that's so vulnerable.,Resilience runs much deeper:,it's about building modularity into what we do,,building surge breakers into how we organize the basic things that support us. 
 This is a photograph of the Bristol and District,Market Gardeners Association, in 1897.,This is at a time when the city of Bristol,,which is quite close to here,,was surrounded by commercial market gardens,,which provided a significant amount of the food,that was consumed in the town, and created a lot of employment for people, as well.,There was a degree of resilience, if you like, at that time,,which we can now only look back on with envy. 
 So how does this transition idea work?,So basically, you have a group of people who are excited by the idea.,They pick up some of the tools that we've developed.,They start to run an awareness-raising program,looking at how this might actually work in the town.,They show films, they give talks, and so on.,It's a process which is playful and creative,and informative.,Then they start to form working groups, looking at different aspects of this,,and then from that, there emerge a whole lot of projects,which then the transition project itself,starts to support and enable. 
 So it started out with some work I was involved in in Ireland,,where I was teaching, and has since spread.,There are now over 200 formal transition projects.,And there are thousands of others who are at what we call the mulling stage.,They are mulling whether they're going to take it further.,And actually a lot of them are doing huge amounts of stuff.,But what do they actually do? You know, it's a kind of nice idea,,but what do they actually do on the ground? 
 Well, I think it's really important to make the point that actually,you know, this isn't something which is going to do everything on its own.,We need international legislation from Copenhagen and so on.,We need national responses. We need local government responses.,But all of those things are going to be much easier,if we have communities that are vibrant and coming up with ideas,and leading from the front, making unelectable policies electable,,over the next 5 to 10 years. 
 Some of the things that emerge from it are local food projects,,like community-supported agriculture schemes,,urban food production, creating local food directories, and so on.,A lot of places now are starting to set up their own energy companies,,community-owned energy companies,,where the community can invest money into itself,,to start putting in place,the kind of renewable energy infrastructure that we need.,A lot of places are working with their local schools.,Newent in the Forest of Dean: big polytunnel they built for the school;,the kids are learning how to grow food.,Promoting recycling, things like garden-share,,that matches up people who don't have a garden,who would like to grow food, with people who have gardens they aren't using anymore.,Planting productive trees throughout urban spaces.,And also starting to play around with the idea of,alternative currencies. 
 This is Lewes in Sussex,,who have recently launched the Lewes Pound,,a currency that you can only spend within the town,,as a way of starting to cycle money within the local economy.,You take it anywhere else, it's not worth anything.,But actually within the town you start to create these economic,cycles much more effectively. 
 Another thing that they do is what we call an energy descent plan,,which is basically to develop a plan B for the town.,Most of our local authorities, when they sit down to plan,for the next five, 10, 15, 20 years of a community,,still start by assuming that there will be more energy,,more cars, more housing,,more jobs, more growth, and so on.,What does it look like if that's not the case? And how can we embrace that,and actually come up with something that was actually more likely,to sustain everybody?,As a friend of mine says, "Life is a series of things you're not quite ready for.",And that's certainly been my experience with transition.,From three years ago, it just being an idea,,this has become something that has virally swept around the world.,We're getting a lot of interest from government. Ed Miliband,,the energy minister of this country, was invited to come to our recent conference,as a keynote listener.,Which he did --,(Laughter),(Applause) --,and has since become a great advocate of the whole idea. 
 There are now two local authorities in this country,who have declared themselves transitional local authorities,,Leicestershire and Somerset. And in Stroud,,the transition group there, in effect, wrote the local government's food plan.,And the head of the council said,,"If we didn't have Transition Stroud, we would have to invent,all of that community infrastructure for the first time.",As we see the spread of it, we see national hubs emerging. 
 In Scotland, the Scottish government's climate change fund,has funded Transition Scotland,as a national organization supporting the spread of this.,And we see it all over the place as well now.,But the key to transition is thinking not that we have to change everything now,,but that things are already inevitably changing,,and what we need to do is to work creatively with that,,based on asking the right questions. 
 I think I'd like to just return at the end,to the idea of stories.,Because I think stories are vital here.,And actually the stories that we tell ourselves,,we have a huge dearth of stories about how to move forward creatively from here.,And one of the key things that transition does,is to pull those stories out of what people are doing.,Stories about the community that's produced,its own 21 pound note, for example,,the school that's turned its car park into a food garden,,the community that's founded its own energy company.,And for me, one of the great stories recently,was the Obamas digging up the south lawn of the White House,to create a vegetable garden. Because the last time that was done,,when Eleanor Roosevelt did it,,it led to the creation of 20 million vegetable gardens across the United States. 
 So the question I'd like to leave you with, really,,is -- for all aspects of the things that your community needs,in order to thrive,,how can it be done in such a way,that drastically reduces its carbon emissions,,while also building resilience? 
 Personally, I feel enormously grateful,to have lived through the age of cheap oil.,I've been astonishingly lucky, we've been astonishingly lucky.,But let us honor what it has bought us,,and move forward from this point.,Because if we cling to it, and continue to assume,that it can underpin our choices,,the future that it presents to us is one which is really unmanageable.,And by loving and leaving all that oil has done for us,,and that the Oil Age has done for us,,we are able to then begin the creation,of a world which is more resilient,,more nourishing,,and in which, we find ourselves fitter, more skilled,and more connected to each other.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)Chris has been so nice.,I don't know how you keep it up, Chris, I really don't.,So nice, all week. He's the kind of man you could say to,,"Chris, I'm really sorry, I've crashed your car.,And it gets worse, I crashed it into your house.,Your house has caught fire.,And what's more, your wife has just run off with your best friend." 
 And you know that Chris would say, "Thank you.",(Laughter),"Thank you for sharing, that's really interesting.",(Laughter),"Thank you for taking me to a place that I didn't know existed. Thank you.",(Laughter) 
 One of the -- (Applause) Thank you for inviting us.,One of the things about appearing later on in the TED week is that,,gradually, as the days go by,,all the other speakers cover most of what you were going to say.,(Laughter),Nuclear fusion, I had about 10 minutes on that.,Spectroscopy, that was another one.,Parallel universes.,And so this morning I thought, "Oh well, I'll just do a card trick.",(Laughter),That one's gone as well.,And today is Emmanuel's day, I think we've agreed that, already, haven't we?,Emmanuel? Absolutely. (Applause),I was planning on finishing on a dance ...,(Laughter),So, that's going to look pretty shabby now. 
 So, what I thought I'd do is -- in honor of Emmanuel --,is, what I can do is to launch today the first,TED Global auction.,If I could start, this is the Enigma decoding machine.,(Laughter),Who will start me with $1,000? Anyone? 
 Thank you. Bruno's face, just then,,he said, "No, don't go through this. Don't, please don't.,Don't go through this. Don't do it.",(Laughter) 
 I'm worried. When I first got the invitation,,they said somewhere in the thing, they said, "15 minutes to change the world,,your moment onstage." 15 minutes to change the world.,I don't know about you, it takes me 15 minutes to change a plug.,(Laughter),So, the idea of changing the world is really quite an extraordinary one.,Well, of course now we know we don't have to change a plug,,now we've seen that wonderful demonstration,of the wireless electric -- fantastic. You know, it inspires us.,300 years ago he'd have been burnt at the stake for that.,(Laughter),And now it's an idea.,(Laughter),It's great. It's fantastic.,But you do meet some fantastic people,,people who look at the world in a totally different way. 
 Yesterday, David Deutsch, another one,who covered most of what I was going to say.,(Laughter),But when you think of the world in that way,,it does make going to Starbucks a whole new experience, don't you think?,I mean, he must walk in and they will say,,"Would you like a macchiato,,or a latte, or an Americano,,or a cappuccino?",And he'll say,,"You're offering me things that are infinitely variable.",(Laughter),"How can your coffee be true?",(Laughter),And they will say,,"Would you mind if I serve the next customer?",(Laughter) 
 And Elaine Morgan yesterday, wasn't she wonderful?,Fantastic. Really good.,Her talk about the aquatic ape, and the link, of course,,the link between Darwinism,and the fact that we are all naked beneath this --,we're not hirsute and we can swim rather well.,And she said, you know, she's 90. She's running out of time, she said.,And she's desperate to find more evidence for the link.,And I think, "I'm sitting next to Lewis Pugh.",(Laughter),This man has swum around the North Pole, what more evidence do you want?,(Laughter),And there he is.,(Applause),That's how TED brings these connections together. 
 I wasn't here on Tuesday. I didn't actually see Gordon Brown's,job application -- um, sorry.,(Laughter),I'm so sorry. (Applause),I'm so sorry. No, no. (Applause),No, no, ahh ... (Applause),(As Brown): "Global problems require Scottish solutions.",(Laughter),The problem I have is because Gordon Brown, he comes onstage,and he looks for all the world like a man,who's just taken the head off a bear suit. 
 (As Brown): "Hello, can I tell you what happened in the woods back there?,Uh, no." (Laughter),"I'm sorry. I've only got 18 minutes, 18 minutes to talk about saving the world,,saving the planet, global institutions.,Our work on climate change,,I've only got 18 minutes, unfortunately I'm not able to tell you about,all the wonderful things we're doing to promote the climate change agenda,in Great Britain,,like the third runway we're planning at Heathrow Airport ...",(Laughter),"The large coal-fired power station we're building,at King's North,,and of course the exciting news that only today,,only this week, Britain's only manufacturer,of wind turbines has been forced to close.,No time, unfortunately,,to mention those.",(Applause),"British jobs for Scottish people ...,No." (Laughter),"Christian principles, Christian values.,Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal,,thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife.",(Laughter),"Although to be honest, when I was at Number 11 that was never going to be a problem.",(Laughter) 
 (As Tony Blair): "Yeah, alright, come on, eh.,Alright Gordon, come on, eh.,I just, can I just say a few things about,,first about Cherie, because she's a wonderful lady,,my wife, with a wonderful smile.,That reminds me, I must post that letter.",(Laughter),"I just think, you know, what people forget,,Gordon and I, we always got on perfectly well.,Alright, it was never exactly 'Brokeback Mountain.'",(Laughter),"You know, I wrote to him, just before I left office. I said,,'Can I rely on your support for the next month?',And he wrote back. He said, 'No, you can't.',Which kind of surprised me, because I'd never seen 'can't' spelled that way before.",(Laughter) 
 Another thing Gordon could have mentioned in his speech,to the Mansion House in 2002 --,that was to the building; the people weren't listening.,But the people, when talking about the finance industry, he said,,"What you as the city of London have done for financial services,,we, as a government, hope to do for the economy as a whole.",(Laughter),When you think what's happened to financial services,,and you see what's happened to the economy, you think,,"Well, there is a man who delivers on his promises.",(Laughter) 
 But we're in a new world now. We're in a completely new world.,This is the first time that I can remember, where if you get a letter,from the bank manager about a loan, you don't know if you're borrowing,money from him, or if he's borrowing money from you.,Am I right? 
 These extraordinary things, Icelandic Internet accounts.,Did anyone here have an Icelandic Internet account?,Why would you do that? Why would -- It's like one step up,from replying to one of those emails from Nigeria, isn't it?,(Laughter),Asking for your bank details.,And, you know, Iceland, it was never going to cut it.,It didn't have that kind of collateral.,What does it have? It has fish, that's all.,That's why the Prime Minister went on television. He said,,"This has left us all,with a very big haddock.",(Laughter) 
 A lot of what I do -- I have to try and make sense,of things before I can make nonsense of them.,And making sense of the financial crisis is very, very difficult.,Luckily, somebody like George Bush was really helpful.,He summed it up, really, at a dinner.,He was speaking at a dinner, he said,,"Wall Street got drunk.",(Laughter),"And now it's got a hangover.",And that's, you know, that's something --,(Applause),And that's something we can relate to.,It's certainly something he can relate to.,(Laughter) 
 And the other one, of course, is Donald Rumsfeld, who said,,"There are the known knowns, the things we know we know.,And then you got the known unknowns,,the things we know we don't know.,And then you got the unknown unknowns, those are the things,we don't know we don't know.",And being English, when I first heard that I thought, "What a load of cock.",And then, you're now, well, actually, that's what this is about. 
 This whole, what Ben Bernanke has said,,the chaotic unwinding of the world's financial system,,it's about -- they don't know, they didn't know what they were doing.,In 2006, the head of the American Mortgage Bankers Association said, quote,,"As we can clearly see,,no seismic occurrence,is about to overwhelm the U.S. economy.",Now, there is a man on top of his job.,(Laughter),And when the crisis was happening, the head of quantitative equities,at Lehman Brothers said,,"Events which models predicted would happen,once every 10,000 years,happened every day for three days." 
 So, it's extraordinary. It's a new world that's very, very difficult to make sense of.,But we have a new hope. We have a new man.,America has now elected its first openly black President.,(Laughter),Wonderful news.,Not only that, he's left-handed. Have you noticed this?,How many people here are left-handed?,You see, a lot of the people that I most admire,,they're great artists, great designers, great thinkers,,they're left-handed.,And somebody said to me last night, you know, being left-handed,,you have to learn to write without smudging the ink.,And somebody was talking about metaphors on Monday.,And I thought, what a wonderful metaphor, isn't it? An American President who,has to write without smudging the ink. 
 You like that one? As opposed to you could see,George Bush, well, what's the metaphor there?,I think it would be something out of the aquatic ape thing, wouldn't it?,"Well, you know I'm sorry about that.,I'm right-handed but I seem to have smudged that ink as well.",(Laughter),But, you know, he's gone. Now he's gone.,That's eight years of American History, eight minutes of my act,,just gone like that. 
 "You know, it's the end of an error [sic].,I happen to believe it was a great error.,I know folks said to me they believe it was one of the greatest errors,in the history of the United States.,But we proved them wrong in Iraq.,They said there was no link between Iraq and Al Qaeda.,There is now.",(Laughter),"But I have a message for the suicide bombers,,for those people who've blown themselves up.",(Laughter),"We're going to find you.",(Laughter),"We're going to make sure you don't do it again.",(Laughter) 
 But now he's gone, and it's great to see one of the --,arguably one of the worst speech makers,in American history,,now given way to one of the greatest, in Obama.,You were there, maybe, on the night of his victory.,And he spoke to the crowd in Chicago, he said,,"If there is anyone out there,who still doubts,that America is a place,where all things are possible ...",I can't do the whole thing because it would take too long, it really would.,(Laughter),But you get the picture. And then it goes to the inauguration.,And he and the Chief Justice, they trip over each other,,they get their words wrong and they screw the thing up.,And there is George Bush sitting there going, "Heh heh heh heh ...",(Laughter),"Not so easy is it? Heh heh heh.",(Laughter) 
 But the interesting thing is, Gordon Brown was talking about Cicero,,who said, people would listen to a speech, they said, "Great speech.",And then they'd listen to Demosthenes,,and they'd say, "Let's march.",And we all want to believe in President Obama.,It's rather like that line in the film "As Good As it Gets.",Do you remember that film with Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson,,and Helen Hunt says to Jack Nicholson, "What do you see in me?",And Jack Nicholson just says,,"You make me want to be a better man." 
 And you want a leader who inspires and challenges,and makes you want to be a better citizen. Right?,But at the moment, it's a Cicero thing.,We like what Barack Obama says, but we don't do anything about it.,So he comes over to this country, and he says,,"We need,a big fiscal stimulus.",And everyone goes, "Great!" He leaves the country,and the French and the Germans go, "No, no, forget about that,,absolutely not." Nothing happens. He goes to Strasburg.,He says, "We need more boots on the ground in Afghanistan.",And everyone goes, "Great idea.",He leaves, people go, "No no no, we're not going to do that.,5,000 maximum, and no rockets. No, no, not going to do it.",He goes to Prague, he says, "We believe in a nuclear-free world." 
 And it's great to have an American president who can say the word "nuclear,",let's just point that out first.,Do you remember that? George Bush, "A nu-ca-ler.",Sorry, what? "A nu-ca-ler.",(Laughter),Could you say "avuncular"? "Avunclear.",(Laughter),Thank you very much. 
 But he says, "We want a nuclear-free world.",And that day, North Korea, that very day,,North Korea is just seeing if it can,just get one over Japan --,(Laughter) --,and land it before ... 
 So, where do we look for inspiration? We've still got Bill Clinton.,"Travels the world." (Laughs),"I believe, I believe it was President Dwight D. Eisenhower who said ...",(Laughter),"Tell a lie; it was Diana Ross ...",(Laughter),"... who said, reach out and touch ...",(Laughter),"... somebody's gla -- hand.",(Laughter),"Make this world a better place, if you can.,I just think that's important. I really do.,And I was hoping Hillary would get to the White House,,because she'd have been out of our home for four years.,And I, you know." (Laughter),"So, when that didn't work out I had to make a few arrangements, let me tell you.",(Laughter) 
 So, there's him. In Britain we have Prince Charles:,"And the environment is so important, all we can do.,My wife gets fed up with me constantly trying to,push emissions up her agenda.",(Laughter) 
 Or, any South Africans, we have Mandela to inspire.,Mandela, the great man Mandela.,He's been honored with a statue now.,The previous highest honor he had in Britain,was a visit from the team from Ground Force, a gardening program.,"So, Nelson, how would you like a nice water feature?","Ahh, listen to me Mr. Titchmarsh.",(Laughter),"I was held in prison,for nearly 30 years,on an island,in the middle of the ocean.,Why would I need a bloody water feature?",(Laughter) 
 Very quickly: I wasn't quite sure how to end this talk,and then yesterday that man came up with a wonderful quote,from the "Japanese Essays on Idleness",which said it's nice to have something which is unfinished,because it implies there is still room for growth.,Thank you very much indeed.,(Applause)So, I am indeed going to talk about,the spaces men create for themselves,,but first I want to tell you why I'm here.,I'm here for two reasons. These two guys,are my two sons Ford and Wren.,When Ford was about three years old,,we shared a very small room together,,in a very small space.,My office was on one half of the bedroom,,and his bedroom was on the other half.,And you can imagine, if you're a writer,,that things would get really crowded around deadlines. 
 So when Wren was on the way,,I realized I needed to find a space of my own.,There was no more space in the house. So I went out to the backyard,,and without any previous building experience,,and about 3,000 dollars and some,recycled materials, I built this space.,It had everything I needed. It was quiet.,There was enough space. And I had control, which was very important. 
 As I was building this space, I thought,to myself, "Surely I'm not the only guy,to have to have carved out a space for his own.",So I did some research.,And I found that there was an historic precedence.,Hemingway had his writing space.,Elvis had two or three manspaces,,which is pretty unique because he lived with both his wife and his mother in Graceland.,In the popular culture, Superman had the Fortress of Solitude,,and there was, of course, the Batcave. 
 So I realized then that I wanted to go out on a journey,and see what guys were creating for themselves now.,Here is one of the first spaces I found. It is in Austin, Texas,,which is where I'm from.,On the outside it looks like a very typical garage, a nice garage.,But on the inside, it's anything but.,And this, to me, is a pretty classic manspace.,It has neon concert posters, a bar,and, of course, the leg lamp,,which is very important. 
 I soon realized that manspaces didn't have to be only inside.,This guy built a bowling alley in his backyard,,out of landscaping timbers, astroturf.,And he found the scoreboard in the trash. 
 Here's another outdoor space, a little bit more sophisticated.,This a 1923 wooden tugboat,,made completely out of Douglas fir.,The guy did it all himself.,And there is about 1,000 square feet of hanging-out space inside. 
 So, pretty early on in my investigations,I realized what I was finding was not what I expected to find,,which was, quite frankly, a lot of beer can pyramids,and overstuffed couches and flat-screen TVs.,There were definitely hang-out spots.,But some were for working, some were for playing,,some were for guys to collect their things.,Most of all, I was just surprised with what I was finding. 
 Take this place for example.,On the outside it looks like a typical northeastern garage.,This is in Long Island, New York.,The only thing that might tip you off is the round window.,On the inside it's a recreation of a,16th century Japanese tea house.,The man imported all the materials from Japan,,and he hired a Japanese carpenter,to build it in the traditional style.,It has no nails or screws.,All the joints are hand-carved and hand-scribed. 
 Here is another pretty typical scene. This is a suburban Las Vegas neighborhood.,But you open one of the garage doors,and there is a professional-size boxing ring inside.,(Laughter),And so there is a good reason for this.,It was built by this man who is Wayne McCullough.,He won the silver medal for Ireland,in the 1992 Olympics,,and he trains in this space. He trains other people.,And right off the garage he has his own trophy room,where he can sort of bask in his accomplishments,,which is another sort of important part about a manspace. 
 So, while this space represents someone's profession,,this one certainly represents a passion.,It's made to look like the inside of an English sailing ship.,It's a collection of nautical antiques from the 1700s and 1800s.,Museum quality. 
 So, as I came to the end of my journey,,I found over 50 spaces.,And they were unexpected and they were surprising.,But they were also --,I was really impressed by how personalized they were,,and how much work went into them.,And I realized that's because the guys that I met,were all very passionate about what they did.,And they really loved their professions.,And they were very passionate about their collections and their hobbies.,And so they created these spaces,to reflect what they love to do,,and who they were. 
 So if you don't have a space of your own,,I highly recommend finding one, and getting into it.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)I believe that there are new, hidden tensions,that are actually happening between people and institutions --,institutions that are the institutions that people,inhabit in their daily life:,schools, hospitals, workplaces,,factories, offices, etc. 
 And something that I see happening,is something that I would like to call,a sort of "democratization of intimacy.",And what do I mean by that?,I mean that what people are doing,is, in fact, they are sort of, with their communication channels,,they are breaking an imposed isolation,that these institutions are imposing on them. 
 How are they doing this? They're doing it,in a very simple way, by calling their mom from work,,by IMing from their office to their friends,,by texting under the desk.,The pictures that you're seeing behind me,are people that I visited in the last few months.,And I asked them to come along with the person they communicate with most.,And somebody brought a boyfriend, somebody a father.,One young woman brought her grandfather.,For 20 years, I've been looking at how people use,channels such as email, the mobile phone, texting, etc.,What we're actually going to see is that, fundamentally,,people are communicating on a regular basis,with five, six, seven of their most intimate sphere. 
 Now, lets take some data. Facebook.,Recently some sociologists from Facebook --,Facebook is the channel that you would expect,is the most enlargening of all channels.,And an average user,,said Cameron Marlow,,from Facebook, has about 120 friends.,But he actually talks to,,has two-way exchanges with, about four to six people,on a regular base, depending on his gender.,Academic research on instant messaging,also shows 100 people on buddy lists,,but fundamentally people chat with two, three, four --,anyway, less than five.,My own research on cellphones and voice calls,shows that 80 percent of the calls,are actually made to four people. 80 percent.,And when you go to Skype, it's down to two people.,A lot of sociologists actually are quite disappointed.,I mean, I've been a bit disappointed sometimes,when I saw this data and all this deployment, just for five people.,And some sociologists actually feel that,it's a closure, it's a cocooning,,that we're disengaging from the public.,And I would actually, I would like to show you that,if we actually look at who is doing it,,and from where they're doing it,,actually there is an incredible social transformation. 
 There are three stories that I think are quite good examples.,The first gentleman, he's a baker.,And so he starts working every morning at four o'clock in the morning.,And around eight o'clock he sort of sneaks away from his oven,,cleans his hands from the flour,and calls his wife.,He just wants to wish her a good day, because that's the start of her day.,And I've heard this story a number of times.,A young factory worker who works night shifts,,who manages to sneak away from the factory floor,,where there is CCTV by the way,,and find a corner, where at 11 o'clock at night,he can call his girlfriend and just say goodnight.,Or a mother who, at four o'clock,,suddenly manages to find a corner in the toilet,to check that her children are safely home. 
 Then there is another couple, there is a Brazilian couple.,They've lived in Italy for a number of years.,They Skype with their families a few times a week.,But once a fortnight, they actually put the computer on their dining table,,pull out the webcam and actually have dinner,with their family in Sao Paulo. And they have a big event of it.,And I heard this story the first time a couple of years ago,from a very modest family,of immigrants from Kosovo in Switzerland.,They had set up a big screen in their living room,,and every morning they had breakfast with their grandmother.,But Danny Miller, who is a very good anthropologist,who is working on Filipina migrant women,who leave their children back in the Philippines,,was telling me about how much parenting is going on,through Skype,,and how much these mothers are engaged with their children through Skype. 
 And then there is the third couple. They are two friends.,They chat to each other every day, a few times a day actually.,And finally, finally, they've managed to put,instant messaging on their computers at work.,And now, obviously, they have it open.,Whenever they have a moment they chat to each other.,And this is exactly what we've been seeing,with teenagers and kids doing it in school, under the table,,and texting under the table to their friends.,So, none of these cases are unique.,I mean, I could tell you hundreds of them. 
 But what is really exceptional is the setting.,So, think of the three settings I've talked to you about:,factory, migration, office.,But it could be in a school, it could be an administration,,it could be a hospital.,Three settings that, if we just step back 15 years,,if you just think back 15 years,,when you clocked in,,when you clocked in to an office,,when you clocked in to a factory,,there was no contact for the whole duration of the time,,there was no contact with your private sphere.,If you were lucky there was a public phone hanging in the corridor or somewhere.,If you were in management, oh, that was a different story.,Maybe you had a direct line.,If you were not, you maybe had to go through an operator.,But basically, when you walked into those buildings,,the private sphere was left behind you. 
 And this has become such a norm of our professional lives,,such a norm and such an expectation.,And it had nothing to do with technical capability.,The phones were there. But the expectation was once you moved in there,your commitment was fully to the task at hand,,fully to the people around you.,That was where the focus had to be.,And this has become such a cultural norm,that we actually school our children for them to be capable to do this cleavage.,If you think nursery, kindergarten, first years of school,are just dedicated to take away the children,,to make them used to staying long hours away from their family. 
 And then the school enacts perfectly well.,It mimics perfectly all the rituals that we will find in offices:,rituals of entry, rituals of exit,,the schedules, the uniforms in this country,,things that identify you, team-building activities,,team building that will allow you to basically,be with a random group of kids, or a random group of people,that you will have to be with for a number of time.,And of course, the major thing:,learn to pay attention,,to concentrate and focus your attention.,This only started about 150 years ago.,It only started with the birth of modern bureaucracy,,and of industrial revolution.,When people basically had to go somewhere else to work,and carry out the work.,And when with modern bureaucracy there was a very rational approach,,where there was a clear distinction between the private sphere,and the public sphere. 
 So, until then, basically people were living on top of their trades.,They were living on top of the land they were laboring.,They were living on top of the workshops where they were working.,And if you think, it's permeated our whole culture,,even our cities.,If you think of medieval cities, medieval cities the boroughs,all have the names of the guilds and professions that lived there.,Now we have sprawling residential suburbias,that are well distinct from production areas,and commercial areas. 
 And actually, over these 150 years,,there has been a very clear class system that also has emerged.,So the lower the status of the job,and of the person carrying out, the more removed,he would be from his personal sphere.,People have taken this amazing possibility,of actually being in contact all through the day,or in all types of situations.,And they are doing it massively.,The Pew Institute, which produces good data,on a regular basis on, for instance, in the States,,says that -- and I think that this number is conservative --,50 percent of anybody with email access at work,is actually doing private email from his office.,I really think that the number is conservative.,In my own research, we saw that the peak for private email,is actually 11 o'clock in the morning, whatever the country.,75 percent of people admit doing private,conversations from work on their mobile phones.,100 percent are using text. 
 The point is that this re-appropriation of the personal sphere,is not terribly successful with all institutions.,I'm always surprised the U.S. Army,sociologists are discussing of the impact,for instance, of soldiers in Iraq,having daily contact with their families.,But there are many institutions that are actually blocking this access.,And every day, every single day,,I read news that makes me cringe,,like a $15 fine,to kids in Texas,,for using, every time they take out their mobile phone in school.,Immediate dismissal to bus drivers in New York,,if seen with a mobile phone in a hand.,Companies blocking access to IM or to Facebook. 
 Behind issues of security and safety,,which have always been the arguments for social control,,in fact what is going on is that,these institutions are trying to decide,who, in fact, has a right to self determine their attention,,to decide, whether they should, or not, be isolated.,And they are actually trying to block, in a certain sense,,this movement of a greater possibility of intimacy.The problem I want to talk with younabout is really the problem of:,How does one supply health carenin a world in which cost is everything?,How do you do that?,And the basic paradigmnwe want to suggest to you,,I want to suggest to you,,is one in which you saynthat in order to treat disease,,you have to first knownwhat you're treating, that's diagnostics,,and then you have to do something. 
 The program we're involved in is somethingnwe call "Diagnostics for All,",or "zero-cost diagnostics.",How do you provide medicallynrelevant information,at as close as possible to zero cost?,How do you do it?,Let me just give you two examples.,The rigors of military medicine are notnso dissimilar from the third world:,poor resources, a rigorous environment --na series of problems --,light weight and things of this kind.,And also they're not so differentnfrom the home health care,and diagnostic system world. 
 So, the technology I want to talknabout is for the third world,,for the developing world,,but it has, I think,nmuch broader application,,because information is so importantnin the health care system.,So you see two examples here.,One is a lab that is actuallyna fairly high-end laboratory in Africa.,The second is basically an entrepreneurnwho is set up and doing who-knows-what,at a table in a market.,I don't know what kindnof health care is delivered there.,But it's not reallynwhat is probably most efficient. 
 What is our approach?,The way in which one typicallynapproaches a problem of lowering cost,,starting from the perspectivenof the United States,,is to take our solution,,and then try to cut cost out of it.,No matter how you do that,,you're not going to startnwith a $100,000 instrument,and bring it down to no cost.,It isn't going to work. 
 So the approach we tooknwas the other way around, to ask:,What is the cheapest possible stuff,that you could makena diagnostic system out of,,and get useful informationnand add function?,And what we've chosen is paper.,What you see here is a prototypic device.,It's about a centimeter on the side.,It's about the size of a fingernail.,The lines around the edges are a polymer.,It's made of paper.,And paper, of course, wicks fluid,nas you know, paper, cloth --,drop wine on the tablecloth,,and the wine wicks all over everything.,Put it on your shirt, it ruins the shirt.,That's what a hydrophilic surface does. 
 So in this device, the ideanis that you drip the bottom end of it,in a drop of, in this case, urine.,The fluid wicks its wayninto those chambers at the top.,The brown color indicatesnthe amount of glucose in the urine,,the blue color indicates the amountnof protein in the urine.,And the combination of those twonis a first-order shot,at a number of useful thingsnthat you want.,So, this is an example of a devicenmade from a simple piece of paper. 
 Now, how simple can you makenthe production?,Why do we choose paper?,There's an examplenof the same thing on a finger,,showing you basically what it looks like.,One reason for using papernis that it's everywhere.,We have made these kinds of devicesnusing napkins and toilet paper,and wraps, and all kinds of stuff. 
 So the production capability is there.,The second is, you can put lots and lotsnof tests in a very small place.,I'll show you in a momentnthat the stack of paper there,would probably holdnsomething like 100,000 tests,,something of that kind. 
 And then finally, a pointnyou don't think of so much,in developed world medicine:,it eliminates sharps.,And what sharps meansnis needles, things that stick.,If you've taken a samplenof someone's blood,and the someone might have hepatitis C,,you don't want to make a mistakenand stick it in you.,You don't want to do that.,So how do you dispose of that?,It's a problem everywhere,nand here, you simply burn it.,So it's a sort of a practical approachnto starting on things. 
 Now, you say, "If paper is a good idea,,other people have surely thought of it.",And the answer is, of course, yes.,Those half of you, roughly, who are women,,at some point may have hadna pregnancy test.,And the most common of thesenis in a device,that looks like the thing on the left.,It's something calledna lateral-flow immunoassay.,In that particular test,,urine, either containingna hormone called hCG,,does or does not flownacross a piece of paper.,And there are two bars; one barnindicates that the test is working,,and if the second bar shows up,nyou're pregnant. 
 This is a terrific kind of testnin a binary world,,and the nice thing about pregnancynis either you are pregnant,or you're not pregnant;,you're not partially pregnantnor thinking about being pregnant,or something of that sort.,So it works very well there,nbut it doesn't work very well,when you need morenquantitative information. 
 There are also dipsticks,,but if you look at the dipsticks,,they're for another kindnof urine analysis.,There are an awful lot of colorsnand things like that.,What do you actually do about thatnin a difficult circumstance?,So the approach we started with is to ask:,Is it really practicalnto make things of this sort?,And that problem is now,nin a purely engineering way, solved.,And the procedure that we havenis simply to start with paper.,You run it through a new kindnof printer called a wax printer.,The wax printer doesnwhat looks like printing.,It is printing.,You put that on, you warm it a little bit,,the wax prints through,nso it absorbs into the paper,,and you end up with the device you want. 
 The printers cost 800 bucks now.,We estimate that if you werento run them 24 hours a day,,they'd make about 10 million tests a year.,So it's a solved problem.nThat particular problem is solved.,And there is an examplenof the kind of thing that you see.,That's on a piece of 8 by 12 paper.,That takes about two seconds to make.,And so I regard that as done.,There's a very important issue here,,which is that because it's a printer,na color printer, it prints colors.,That's what color printers do.,I'll show you in a moment,nthat's actually quite useful. 
 Now, the next questionnthat you would like to ask is:,What would you like to measure?nWhat would you like to analyze?,And the thing you'd most like to analyze,nwe're a fair distance from.,It's what's calledn"fever of undiagnosed origin.",Someone comes into the clinic,nthey have a fever, they feel bad.,What do they have?,Do they have TB? Do they have AIDS?nDo they have a common cold?,The triage problem.,That's a hard problem for reasonsnI won't go through.,There are an awful lot of thingsnthat you'd like to distinguish among.,But then there are a series of things --,AIDS, hepatitis, malaria, TB, others --,and simpler ones,nsuch as guidance of treatment. 
 Now, even that's morencomplicated than you think.,A friend of mine worksnin transcultural psychiatry,,and he is interested in the question,of why people donand don't take their meds.,So Dapsone, or something like that,nyou have to take for a while.,He has a wonderful storynof talking to a villager in India,and saying,,"Have you taken your Dapsone?" "Yes.","Have you taken it every day?" "Yes.","Have you taken if for a month?" "Yes.",What the guy actually meant,was that he'd fed a 30-day dose of Dapsonento his dog that morning. 
 (Laughter) 
 And he was telling the truth,nbecause in a different culture,,the dog is a surrogate for you;,"today," "this month,"n"since the rainy season" --,there are lots of opportunitiesnfor misunderstanding. 
 (Laughter) 
 And so an issue here is to,nin some cases, figure out,how to deal with mattersnthat seem uninteresting, like compliance. 
 Now, take a looknat what a typical test looks like.,Prick a finger, you get some blood --nabout 50 microliters.,That's about all you're going to get,,because you can't usenthe usual sort of systems.,You can't manipulate it very well;,I'll show somethingnabout that in a moment.,So you take the drop of blood,nno further manipulations,,you put it on a little device,,the device filters out the blood cells,nlets the serum go through,,and you get a series of colorsndown in the bottom there.,And the colors indicaten"disease" or "normal.",But even that's complicated,,because to me, colorsnmight indicate "normal,",but after all, we're all sufferingnfrom probably an excess of education. 
 What do you do about somethingnwhich requires quantitative analysis?,And so the solutionnthat we and many other people,are thinking about there,,and at this point,nthere is a dramatic flourish,,and out comes the universal solutionnto everything these days,,which is a cell phone --,in this particular case, a camera phone.,They're everywhere --nsix billion a month in India.,And the idea is that what one doesnis to take the device,,you dip it, you develop the color,,you take a picture,nthe picture goes to a central laboratory.,You don't have to send out a doctor,,you send out somebodynwho can just take the sample,,and in the clinic either a doctor,nor ideally, a computer in this case,,does the analysis.,Turns out to work actually quite well,,particularly when your color printernhas printed the color bars,that indicate how things work. 
 So my view of the health carenworker of the future,is not a doctor, but an 18-year-old,,otherwise unemployed, who has two things:,a backpack fullnof these tests and a lancet,to occasionally take a blood sample,,and an AK-47.,And these are the thingsnthat get him through his day. 
 (Laughter) 
 There's another veryninteresting connection here,,and that is, that what one wants to donis pass through useful information,over what is generallyna pretty awful telephone system.,It turns out there's an enormousnamount of information,already available on that subject,nwhich is the Mars Rover problem.,How do you get back an accurate viewnof the color on Mars,if you have a really terriblenbandwidth to do it with?,And the answer is not complicated,,but it's one which I don't wantnto go through here,,other than to say that the communicationnsystems for doing this,are really pretty well understood. 
 Also, a fact which you may not know,is that the compute capabilitynof this thing is not so different,from the compute capabilitynof your desktop computer.,This is a fantastic devicenwhich is only beginning to be tapped.,I don't know whether the ideanof one computer, one child,makes any sense.,Here's the computer of the future,,because this screen is already therenand they're ubiquitous. 
 All right, let me show you justna little bit about advanced devices.,And we'll start by posingna little problem.,What you see herenis another centimeter-sized device,,and the different colorsnare different colors of dye.,And you notice something,which might strike younas a little bit interesting,,which is, the yellow seems to disappear,,get through the blue,nand then get through the red.,How does that happen?,How do you make somethingnflow through something?,And, of course the answer is, "You don't.",You make it flow under and over. 
 But now the question is:,How do you make it flownunder and over in a piece of paper?,The answer is that what you do --,and the details are notnterribly important here --,is to make something more elaborate:,You take several differentnlayers of paper,,each one containingnits own little fluid system,,and you separate them by pieces of,nliterally, double-sided carpet tape,,the stuff you use to sticknthe carpets onto the floor.,And the fluid will flownfrom one layer into the next.,It distributes itself,nflows through further holes,,distributes itself. 
 And what you see,nat the lower right-hand side there,,is a sample in which a single samplenof blood has been put on the top,,and it has gone throughnand distributed itself,into these 16 holes on the bottom,,in a piece of paper --nbasically, it looks like a chip,,two pieces of paper thick.,And in this particular case,,we were just interestednin the replicability of that.,But that is, in principle,nthe way you solve,the "fever of unexplained origin" problem,,because each one of those spotsnthen becomes a test,for a particular setnof markers of disease,,and this will work in due course. 
 Here is an example of a slightlynmore complicated device.,There's the chip.,You dip in a corner.,The fluid goes into the center.,It distributes itself outninto these various wells or holes,and turns color,,all done with paper and carpet tape.,So it's, I think, as low-cost,as we're likely to be ablento come up and make things. 
 Now, I have two lastnlittle stories to tell you,in finishing off this business.,This is one:,One of the thingsnyou occasionally need to do,is separate blood cells from serum.,And the question was,,here we do it by taking a sample,,we put it in a centrifuge, we spin it,,and you get blood cells out.,Terrific.,What happens if you don't havenelectricity, a centrifuge, and whatever?,And we thought for a whilenof how you might do this,,and the way, in fact, you do it,nis what's shown here.,You get an eggbeater, which is everywhere,nand you saw off a blade,,and then you take tubing,nand you stick it on that.,You put the blood in,nsomebody sits there and spins it.,It works really, really well. 
 And we sat down,nwe did the physics of eggbeaters,and self-aligning tubesnand all the rest of that kind of thing,,and sent it off to a journal.,We were very proud of this,,particularly the title,nwhich was "Eggbeater as Centrifuge." 
 (Laughter) 
 And we sent it off,,and by return mail, it came back.,I called up the editor and I said,,"What's going on? How is this possible?",The editor said, with enormous disdain,,"I read this.,And we're not going to publish it,nbecause we only publish science." 
 (Laughter) 
 And it's an important issue,,because it meansnthat we have to, as a society,,think about what we value.,And if it's just papersnand Phys. Rev. letters,,we've got a problem. 
 Here is another examplenof something which is --,this is a little spectrophotometer.,It measures the absorptionnof light in a sample.,The neat thing about this is,,you have a light source that flickersnon and off at about 1,000 hertz,,another light sourcenthat detects that light at 1,000 hertz,,and so you can run this systemnin broad daylight.,It performs about equivalently,to a system that's on the ordernof 100,000 dollars.,It costs 50 dollars.,We can probably make it for 50 centsnif we put our mind to it.,Why doesn't somebody do it?,The answer is:,How do you make a profitnin a capitalist system, doing that?,Interesting problem. 
 So, let me finish by sayingnthat we've thought about this,as a kind of engineering problem.,And we've asked: Whatnis the scientific unifying idea here?,And we've decidednwe should think about this,not so much in terms of cost,nbut in terms of simplicity.,Simplicity is a neat word.,You've got to thinknabout what simplicity means.,I know what it is,,but I don't actually know what it means. 
 So I actually was interestednenough in this,to put together several groups of people.,The most recent involvedna couple of people at MIT,,one of them beingnan exceptionally bright kid,who is one of the verynfew people I would think of,who's an authentic genius.,We all struggled for an entire daynto think about simplicity.,And I want to give you the answernof this deep scientific thought. 
 [What is simplicity?,"It's impossible to f..k it up"] 
 (Laughter) 
 So, in a sense, you get what you pay for. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Thirteen trillion dollars in wealth,has evaporated over the coursenof the last two years.,We've questioned the future of capitalism.,We've questioned the financial industry.,We've looked at our government oversight.,We've questioned where we're going.,And yet, at the same time,,this very well may bena seminal moment in American history,,an opportunity for the consumernto actually take control and guide us,to a new trajectory in America. 
 I'm calling this The Great Unwind. 
 (Laughter) 
 And the idea is a simple, simple idea,,which is the fact that the consumernhas moved from a state of anxiety,to action.,Consumers who represent 72 percentnof the GDP of America,have actually started, just like banksnand just like businesses,,to de-leverage, to unwindntheir leverage in daily life,,to remove themselvesnfrom the liability and risk,that presents itself as they move forward. 
 So, to understand this --nand I'm going to stress this --,it's not about the consumernbeing in retreat.,The consumer is empowered.,To understand this, we'll step backnand look at what's happened,over the last year and a half.,So if you've been gone,nthis is the CliffsNotes,on what's happened in the economy. 
 (Laughter) 
 Unemployment up. Housing values down.nEquity markets down.,Commodity prices are like this. 
 If you're a mom trying to manage a budget,,and oil was 150 dollarsna barrel last summer,,and it's somewhere between 50 and 70,,do you plan vacations?,How do you buy?,What's your strategy in your household?nWill the bailout work?,We have national debt, Detroit,ncurrency valuations, health care --,all these issues facing us.,You put them all together,nmix them up in a bouillabaisse,,and you have consumer confidencenthat's basically a ticking time bomb. 
 In fact, let's go back and looknat what caused this crisis,,because the consumer,nall of us, in our daily lives,,actually contributedna large part to the problem.,This is something I callnthe 50-20 paradox.,It took us 50 years,to reach annual savings ratingsnof almost 10 percent.,Fifty years.,Do you know what this was right here?nThis was World War II.,Do you know why savings was so high?,There was nothing to buy,nunless you wanted to buy some rivets. 
 What happened, though,nover the course of the last 20 years,,we went from a 10 percent savings ratento a negative savings rate.,Because we binged.,We bought extra-large cars,nsupersized everything,,we bought remediesnfor restless leg syndrome.,All these things togethernbasically created a factor,where the consumer drove usnheadlong into the crisis,that we face today.,The personal debt-to-income rationbasically went from 65 to 135 percent,in the span of about 15 years.,So consumers got over-leveraged.,And of course our banks did as well,nas did our federal government. 
 This is an absolutely staggering chart.,It shows leverage,ntrended out from 1919 to 2009.,And what you end up seeingnis the whole phenomenon,that we are actually stepping forthnand basically leveraging,future education, future childrennin our households. 
 So if you look at this in the contextnof visualizing the bailout,,what you can see is,nif you stack up dollar bills,,first of all, 360,000 dollars,is about the size of a five-foot-four guy.,But if you stack it up, you seenthis amazing, staggering amount of dollars,that have been put into the systemnto fund and bail us out.,So this is the first 315 billion.,But I read this fact the other day,,that one trillion secondsnequals 32,000 years.,So if you think about that,,the context, the casualnessnwith which we talk about,trillion-dollar bailout herenand trillion there,,we are stacking ourselves upnfor long-term leverage. 
 However, consumers have moved.,They are taking responsibility.,What we're seeingnis an uptake in the savings rate.,In fact, 11 straight monthsnof savings have happened,since the beginning of the crisis.,We're working our way back upnto that 10 percent.,Also, remarkably, in the fourth quarter,,spending droppednto its lowest level in 62 years --,almost a 3.7 percent decline. 
 Visa now reports that more peoplenare using debit cards than credit cards.,So we're starting to pay for thingsnwith money that we have.,And we're starting to be much more carefulnabout how we save and invest.,But that's not really the whole story,,because this has also been a dramaticntime of transformation.,And you've got to admit,nover the last year and a half,,consumers have been doingnsome weird things.,It's pretty staggering,nwhat we've lived through.,If you take into accountnthat 80 percent of all Americans,were born after World War II,,this was essentially our Depression. 
 And so, as a result,nsome crazy things have happened.,I'll give you some examples.,Let's talk about dentists, vasectomies,nguns and shark attacks. 
 (Laughter) 
 Dentists report molars --npeople grinding their teeth,,coming in and reportingnthat they've had stress.,So there's an increase in peoplenhaving to have their fillings replaced.,Gun sales, according to the FBI,nwho does background checks,,are up almost 25 percent since January.,Vasectomies are up 48 percent,naccording to the Cornell Institute.,And lastly, but a very good point,,hopefully not relatednto the former point I just made,,which is that shark attacksnare at their lowest level from 2003.,Does anybody know why? 
 (Laughter) 
 No one's at the beach.,So there's a bright side to everything. 
 But seriously, what we see happening,,and the reason I want to stressnthat the consumer is not in retreat,,is that this is a tremendous opportunity,for the consumer who drove usninto this recession,to lead us right back out.,What I mean by that is we cannmove from mindless consumption,to mindful consumption.,Right? 
 (Applause) 
 If you think about the last three decades,,the consumer has movednfrom savvy about marketing in the '90s,,to gathering all these amazing socialnand search tools in this decade.,But the one thing holding them backnis the ability to discriminate.,By restricting their demand,,consumers can actually alignntheir values with their spending,,and drive capitalism and businessnto not just be about more,,but to be about better. 
 We're going to explain that right now.,Based on Y&amp;R's BrandAsset Valuator,,proprietary tool of VMLnand Young &amp; Rubicam,,we set out to understandnwhat's been happening in the crisis,with the consumer marketplace.,We found a couplenof really interesting things.,We're going to gonthrough four value shifts,that we see drivingnnew consumer behaviors,,that offer new management principles. 
 The first cultural value shift we see,is this tendency toward somethingnwe call "liquid life.",This is the movement,from Americans definingntheir success on having things,to having liquidity,,because the less excessnthat you have around you,,the more nimble and fleet of foot you are.,As a result, déclassé consumption is in.,Déclassé consumption is the whole ideanthat spending money frivolously,makes you look a little bit anti-fashion.,The management principlenis dollars and cents. 
 So let's look at some examplesnof this déclassé consumption,that falls out of this value.,The first thing is,nsomething must be happening,when P. Diddy vows to tone down his bling. 
 (Laughter) 
 But seriously, we also haventhis phenomenon,on Madison Avenue and in other places,,where people are actuallynwalking out of luxury boutiques,with ordinary, generic paper bagsnto hide the brand purchases.,We see high-end haggling in fashion today,,high-end hagglingnfor luxury and real estate.,We also see just a relaxing of ego,,and sort of a dismantling of artifice. 
 This is a story on the yacht clubnthat's all basically blue collar.,Blue-collar yacht club --nwhere you can join,,but you've got to work in the boatyardnas condition of membership.,We also see the trend toward tourismnthat's a little bit more low-key:,agritourism -- going to vineyardsnand going to farms. 
 And then we also see this movementnforward from dollars and cents.,What businesses can do to connectnwith these new mindsets,is really interesting.,A couple things that are kind of cool.,One is that Frito-Lay figured outnthis liquidity thing with their consumer.,They found their consumer had morenmoney at the beginning of the month,,less at the end of the month.,So they started to change their packaging:,larger packs at the beginningnof the month,,smaller packaging at the end of the month. 
 Really interestingly, too,nwas the San Francisco Giants.,They've just instituted dynamic pricing.,It takes into account everythingnfrom the pitcher match-ups,,to the weather, to the team records,,in setting prices for the consumer.,Another quick example of these typesnof movements is the rise of Zynga.,Zynga has risen on the consumer's desire,to not want to be locked in to fixed cost.,Again, this theme is about variablencost, variable living.,So micro-payments have become huge.,And lastly, some people are using Hulu,as a device to get ridnof their cable bill.,So, really clever ideas therenthat are being taken ahold of,and that marketersnare starting to understand. 
 The second of the four valuesnis this movement toward,ethics and fair play.,We see that play itself outnwith empathy and respect.,The consumer is demanding it.,And, as a result, businessesnmust provide not only value,,but values.,Increasingly, consumers are lookingnat the culture of the company,,at their conduct in the marketplace.,So we see with empathy and respect,lots of really hopeful thingsncome out of this recession.,I'll give you a few examples. 
 One is the rise toward communitiesnand neighborhoods,,and increased emphasis on your neighborsnas your support system.,Also, a wonderful by-productnof a really lousy thing,,which has been unemployment,,is a rise in volunteerismnthat's been noted in our country.,We also see the phenomenon --nsome of you may have "boomerang kids" --,these are "boomerang alumni,",where universities are actuallynreconnecting with alumni,and helping them with jobs,nsharing skills and retraining.,We also talked about characternand professionalism.,We had this miracle on the Hudsonnin New York City in January,,and suddenly Sully has becomena key name on BabyCenter. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, from a value and values standpoint,,what companies can do is connectnin lots of different ways.,Microsoft is doing something wonderful.,They are actually vowing to retrainntwo million Americans with IT training,,using their existing infrastructurento do something good. 
 Also, a really interestingncompany is GORE-TEX.,GORE-TEX is all aboutnpersonal accountability,of their management and their employees,,to the point where they reallynkind of shun the idea of bosses.,But they also talk about the factnthat their executives --,all of their expense reportsnare put onto their company intranet,for everyone to see.,Complete transparency.,Think twice before you haventhat bottle of wine. 
 (Laughter) 
 The third of the four lawsnof post-crisis consumerism,is about durable living.,We're seeing in our datanthat consumers are realizing,this is a marathon, not a sprint.,They're digging in and lookingnfor ways to extract value,out of every purchase they make.,Witness the fact that Americansnare holding on to their cars,longer than ever before:n9.4 years on average, in March.,A record.,We also see the fact that librariesnhave become a huge resource for America.,Did you know that 68 percentnof Americans now carry a library card?,The highest percentage evernin our nation's history. 
 So what you see in this trendnis also the accumulation of knowledge.,Continuing education is up.,Everything is focusednon betterment, training,,development and moving forward.,We also see a big DIY movement.,I was fascinated to learn that 30 percentnof all homes in America,are actually built by owners.,That includes cottages and the like,,but 30 percent.,People are getting their hands dirty,nrolling up their sleeves.,They want these skills. 
 We see it with the phenomenon of raisingnbackyard hens, chickens and ducks.,And when you work out the math,nthey say it doesn't work,,but the principle is there;,it's about being sustainablenand taking care of yourself.,Then we look at the High Linenin New York City,,an excellent use of reimaginingnexisting infrastructure,for something good,,which is a brand-new parknin New York City. 
 So what brands can do, and companies,nis pay dividends to consumers,,be a brand that lasts,,offer transparency,,promise you're going to be therenbeyond today's sale.,Perfect example of that is Patagonia.,Patagonia's "Footprint Chronicles",basically goes through and tracksnevery product they make,,and gives you social responsibility,,and helps you understand the ethicsnbehind the product they make. 
 Another great example is Fidelity.,Rather than instant cash-back rewardsnon your credit or debit purchases,,this is about 529 rewardsnfor your student education.,Or the interesting company Sunrun.,I love this company.,They've created a consumer collective,where they put solar panels on households,and create a consumer-based utility,,where the electricity they generate,is basically pumped back outninto the marketplace.,So it's a consumer-driven co-op. 
 The fourth post-crisisnconsumerism that we see,is this movementnabout "return to the fold.",It's incredibly important right now.,Trust is not parceled out, as we all know.,It's now about connectingnto your communities,,connecting to your social networks.,In my book, I talked about the fact,that 72 percent of people trustnwhat other people say,about a brand or a company,,versus 15 percent on advertising.,So in that respect, cooperativenconsumerism has really taken off.,This is about consumers workingntogether to get what they want,out of the marketplace.,Let's look at a couple of quick examples. 
 The artisanal movement is huge:,everything about locallynderived products and services,,supporting your local neighborhoods,,whether it's cheeses,nwines and other products.,Also this rise of local currencies.,Realizing that it's difficultnto get loans in this environment,,you're doing businessnwith people you trust,in your local markets.,So this rise of local currencynis another really interesting phenomenon.,And then they did a recent reportnI thought was fascinating.,They actually started, in certainncommunities in the United States,,to publish people's electricity usage.,And what they found out is whennthat was available for public record,,the people's electricity usagenin those communities dropped. 
 Then we also looknat the idea of cow-pooling,,which is the whole phenomenonnof consumers organizing together,to buy meat from organic farms,nthat they know is safe and controlled,in the way that they want itnto be controlled.,And then there's this other reallyninteresting movement in California,,which is about carrot mobs.,The traditional thing would bento boycott, right? Have a stick.,Well, why not have a carrot?,So these are consumers organizing,npooling their resources,to incentify companies to do good. 
 And then we look at what companies can do.,This is all the opportunitynabout being a community organizer.,You have to realizenthat you can't fight and control this.,You actually need to organize it.,You need to harness it.nYou need to give it meaning.,And there's lots of reallyninteresting examples here.,First is just the rise of the factnthat Zagat's has actually moved out of,and diversified from rating restaurants,,into actually rating health care.,So what credentials does Zagat's have?,Well, they have a lot,,because it's their network of people.,So that becomesna very powerful force for them,to make their brand more elastic. 
 Then you look at the phenomenon of Kogi.,This Kogi doesn't exist.nIt's a moving truck.,It's a moving truck through L.A.,,and the only way you can find itnis through Twitter. 
 (Laughter) 
 Or you look at,Johnson &amp; Johnson's "Momversations,"na phenomenal blog that's been built up,,where J&amp;J basically is tappingninto the power of mommy bloggers,,allowing them to create a forumnwhere they can communicate and connect.,And it's also become a very valuablenadvertising revenue for J&amp;J as well.,This, plus the fact that you've gotnphenomenal work from CEOs,,from Ford to Zappos,nconnecting on Twitter,,creating an open environment,,allowing their employeesnto be part of the process,,rather than hidden behind walls. 
 You see this rising forcenin total transparency and openness,that companies are starting to adopt,,all because the consumer is demanding it.,So when we look at this and step back,,what I believe is that the crisisnthat exists today is definitely real.,It's been tremendouslynpowerful for consumers.,But at the same time,nthis is also a tremendous opportunity.,The Chinese character for crisisnis actually the same side,of the same coin.,Crisis equals opportunity.,What we're seeing with consumersnright now is the ability for them,to actually lead us forwardnout of this recession. 
 So we believe that values-driven spendingnwill force capitalism to be better:,it will drive innovation;,it will make longer-lasting products;,it will create better,nmore intuitive customer service;,and it will give us the opportunitynto connect with companies,that share the values that we share.,So when we look back and step out at this,and see the beginning of these trendsnthat we're seeing in our data,,we see a very hopeful picturenfor the future of America. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Something called the Danish Twin Study,established that only about 10 percent,of how long the average person lives,,within certain biological limits, is dictated by our genes.,The other 90 percent is dictated by our lifestyle.,So the premise of Blue Zones: if we can find the,optimal lifestyle of longevity,we can come up with a de facto formula,for longevity. 
 But if you ask the average American what the optimal formula,of longevity is, they probably couldn't tell you.,They've probably heard of the South Beach Diet, or the Atkins Diet.,You have the USDA food pyramid.,There is what Oprah tells us.,There is what Doctor Oz tells us. 
 The fact of the matter is there is a lot of confusion,around what really helps us live longer better.,Should you be running marathons or doing yoga?,Should you eat organic meats,or should you be eating tofu?,When it comes to supplements, should you be taking them?,How about these hormones or resveratrol?,And does purpose play into it?,Spirituality? And how about how we socialize? 
 Well, our approach to finding longevity,was to team up with National Geographic,,and the National Institute on Aging,,to find the four demographically confirmed areas,that are geographically defined.,And then bring a team of experts in there,to methodically go through exactly what these people do,,to distill down the cross-cultural distillation. 
 And at the end of this I'm going to tell you what that distillation is.,But first I'd like to debunk some common myths,when it comes to longevity.,And the first myth is if you try really hard,you can live to be 100.,False.,The problem is, only about one out of 5,000 people,in America live to be 100.,Your chances are very low.,Even though it's the fastest growing demographic in America,,it's hard to reach 100.,The problem is,that we're not programmed for longevity.,We are programmed for something called,procreative success.,I love that word.,It reminds me of my college days. 
 Biologists term procreative success to mean,the age where you have children,and then another generation, the age when your children have children.,After that the effect of evolution,completely dissipates.,If you're a mammal, if you're a rat,or an elephant, or a human, in between, it's the same story.,So to make it to age 100, you not only have to have,had a very good lifestyle, you also have to have won,the genetic lottery. 
 The second myth is,,there are treatments that can help slow,,reverse, or even stop aging.,False.,When you think of it, there is 99 things that can age us.,Deprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes,,those brain cells die, they never come back.,Play tennis too hard, on your knees, ruin your cartilage,,the cartilage never comes back.,Our arteries can clog. Our brains can gunk up with plaque,,and we can get Alzheimer's.,There is just too many things to go wrong. 
 Our bodies have 35 trillion cells,,trillion with a "T." We're talking national debt numbers here.,(Laughter),Those cells turn themselves over once every eight years.,And every time they turn themselves over,there is some damage. And that damage builds up.,And it builds up exponentially.,It's a little bit like the days when we all had,Beatles albums or Eagles albums,and we'd make a copy of that on a cassette tape,,and let our friends copy that cassette tape,,and pretty soon, with successive generations,that tape sounds like garbage.,Well, the same things happen to our cells.,That's why a 65-year-old person,is aging at a rate of about,125 times faster,than a 12-year-old person. 
 So, if there is nothing you can do,to slow your aging or stop your aging,,what am I doing here?,Well, the fact of the matter is,the best science tells us that the capacity of the human body,,my body, your body,,is about 90 years,,a little bit more for women.,But life expectancy in this country,is only 78.,So somewhere along the line,,we're leaving about 12 good years on the table.,These are years that we could get.,And research shows that they would be years largely free of chronic disease,,heart disease, cancer and diabetes. 
 We think the best way to get these missing years,is to look at the cultures around the world,that are actually experiencing them,,areas where people are living to age 100,at rates up to 10 times greater than we are,,areas where the life expectancy,is an extra dozen years,,the rate of middle age mortality is a fraction,of what it is in this country. 
 We found our first Blue Zone about 125 miles,off the coast of Italy, on the island of Sardinia.,And not the entire island, the island is about 1.4 million people,,but only up in the highlands, an area called the Nuoro province.,And here we have this area where men live the longest,,about 10 times more centenarians than we have here in America.,And this is a place where people not only reach age 100,,they do so with extraordinary vigor.,Places where 102 year olds still ride their bike to work,,chop wood, and can beat a guy 60 years younger than them.,(Laughter) 
 Their history actually goes back to about the time of Christ.,It's actually a Bronze Age culture that's been isolated.,Because the land is so infertile,,they largely are shepherds,,which occasions regular, low-intensity physical activity.,Their diet is mostly plant-based,,accentuated with foods that they can carry into the fields.,They came up with an unleavened whole wheat bread,called carta musica made out of durum wheat,,a type of cheese made from grass-fed animals,so the cheese is high in Omega-3 fatty acids,instead of Omega-6 fatty acids from corn-fed animals,,and a type of wine that has three times the level,of polyphenols than any known wine in the world.,It's called Cannonau. 
 But the real secret I think lies more,in the way that they organize their society.,And one of the most salient elements of the Sardinian society,is how they treat older people.,You ever notice here in America, social equity,seems to peak at about age 24?,Just look at the advertisements.,Here in Sardinia, the older you get,the more equity you have,,the more wisdom you're celebrated for.,You go into the bars in Sardinia,,instead of seeing the Sports Illustrated swimsuit calendar,,you see the centenarian of the month calendar. 
 This, as it turns out, is not only good for your aging parents,to keep them close to the family --,it imparts about four to six years of extra life expectancy --,research shows it's also good for the children of those families,,who have lower rates of mortality and lower rates of disease.,That's called the grandmother effect. 
 We found our second Blue Zone,on the other side of the planet,,about 800 miles south of Tokyo,,on the archipelago of Okinawa.,Okinawa is actually 161 small islands.,And in the northern part of the main island,,this is ground zero for world longevity.,This is a place where the oldest living female population is found.,It's a place where people have the longest disability-free,life expectancy in the world.,They have what we want.,They live a long time, and tend to die in their sleep,,very quickly,,and often, I can tell you, after sex. 
 They live about seven good years longer than the average American.,Five times as many centenarians as we have in America.,One fifth the rate of colon and breast cancer,,big killers here in America.,And one sixth the rate of cardiovascular disease.,And the fact that this culture has yielded these numbers,suggests strongly they have something to teach us.,What do they do?,Once again, a plant-based diet,,full of vegetables with lots of color in them.,And they eat about eight times as much tofu,as Americans do. 
 More significant than what they eat is how they eat it.,They have all kinds of little strategies,to keep from overeating,,which, as you know, is a big problem here in America.,A few of the strategies we observed:,they eat off of smaller plates, so they tend to eat fewer calories at every sitting.,Instead of serving family style,,where you can sort of mindlessly eat as you're talking,,they serve at the counter, put the food away,,and then bring it to the table. 
 They also have a 3,000-year-old adage,,which I think is the greatest sort of diet suggestion ever invented.,It was invented by Confucius.,And that diet is known as the Hara, Hatchi, Bu diet.,It's simply a little saying these people say before their meal,to remind them to stop eating when their stomach is [80] percent full.,It takes about a half hour for that full feeling,to travel from your belly to your brain.,And by remembering to stop at 80 percent,it helps keep you from doing that very thing. 
 But, like Sardinia, Okinawa has a few social constructs,that we can associate with longevity.,We know that isolation kills.,Fifteen years ago, the average American had three good friends.,We're down to one and half right now.,If you were lucky enough to be born in Okinawa,,you were born into a system where you,automatically have a half a dozen friends,with whom you travel through life.,They call it a Moai. And if you're in a Moai,you're expected to share the bounty if you encounter luck,,and if things go bad,,child gets sick, parent dies,,you always have somebody who has your back.,This particular Moai, these five ladies,have been together for 97 years.,Their average age is 102. 
 Typically in America,we've divided our adult life up into two sections.,There is our work life,,where we're productive.,And then one day, boom, we retire.,And typically that has meant,retiring to the easy chair,,or going down to Arizona to play golf.,In the Okinawan language there is not even,a word for retirement.,Instead there is one word,that imbues your entire life,,and that word is "ikigai.",And, roughly translated, it means,"the reason for which you wake up in the morning." 
 For this 102-year-old karate master,,his ikigai was carrying forth this martial art.,For this hundred-year-old fisherman,it was continuing to catch fish for his family three times a week.,And this is a question. The National Institute on Aging,actually gave us a questionnaire to give these centenarians.,And one of the questions, they were very culturally astute,,the people who put the questionnaire.,One of the questions was, "What is your ikigai?",They instantly knew why they woke up in the morning.,For this 102 year old woman, her ikigai,was simply her great-great-great-granddaughter.,Two girls separated in age by 101 and a half years.,And I asked her what it felt like,to hold a great-great-great-granddaughter.,And she put her head back and she said,,"It feels like leaping into heaven.",I thought that was a wonderful thought. 
 My editor at Geographic,wanted me to find America's Blue Zone.,And for a while we looked on the prairies of Minnesota,,where actually there is a very high proportion of centenarians.,But that's because all the young people left.,(Laughter),So, we turned to the data again.,And we found America's longest-lived population,among the Seventh-Day Adventists,concentrated in and around Loma Linda, California.,Adventists are conservative Methodists.,They celebrate their Sabbath,from sunset on Friday till sunset on Saturday.,A "24-hour sanctuary in time," they call it.,And they follow five little habits,that conveys to them extraordinary longevity,,comparatively speaking. 
 In America here, life expectancy,for the average woman is 80.,But for an Adventist woman,,their life expectancy is 89.,And the difference is even more pronounced among men,,who are expected to live about 11 years,longer than their American counterparts.,Now, this is a study that followed,about 70,000 people for 30 years.,Sterling study. And I think it supremely illustrates,the premise of this Blue Zone project. 
 This is a heterogeneous community.,It's white, black, Hispanic, Asian.,The only thing that they have in common are a set of,very small lifestyle habits,that they follow ritualistically,for most of their lives.,They take their diet directly from the Bible.,Genesis: Chapter one, Verse [29],,where God talks about legumes and seeds,,and on one more stanza about green plants,,ostensibly missing is meat.,They take this sanctuary in time very serious. 
 For 24 hours every week,,no matter how busy they are, how stressed out they are at work,,where the kids need to be driven,,they stop everything and they focus on their God,,their social network, and then, hardwired right in the religion,,are nature walks.,And the power of this is not that it's done occasionally,,the power is it's done every week for a lifetime.,None of it's hard. None of it costs money.,Adventists also tend to hang out with other Adventists.,So, if you go to an Adventist's party,you don't see people swilling Jim Beam or rolling a joint.,Instead they're talking about their next nature walk,,exchanging recipes, and yes, they pray.,But they influence each other in profound and measurable ways. 
 This is a culture that has yielded Ellsworth Whareham.,Ellsworth Whareham is 97 years old.,He's a multimillionaire,,yet when a contractor wanted 6,000 dollars,to build a privacy fence,,he said, "For that kind of money I'll do it myself.",So for the next three days he was out shoveling cement,,and hauling poles around.,And predictably, perhaps, on the fourth day,he ended up in the operating room.,But not as the guy on the table;,the guy doing open-heart surgery.,At 97 he still does 20 open-heart surgeries every month. 
 Ed Rawlings, 103 years old now,,an active cowboy, starts his morning with a swim.,And on weekends he likes to put on the boards,,throw up rooster tails. 
 And then Marge Deton.,Marge is 104.,Her grandson actually lives in the Twin Cities here.,She starts her day with lifting weights.,She rides her bicycle.,And then she gets in her root-beer colored,1994 Cadillac Seville,,and tears down the San Bernardino freeway,,where she still volunteers for seven different organizations.,I've been on 19 hardcore expeditions.,I'm probably the only person you'll ever meet,who rode his bicycle across,the Sahara desert without sunscreen.,But I'll tell you, there is no adventure more harrowing,than riding shotgun with Marge Deton.,"A stranger is a friend I haven't met yet!" she'd say to me. 
 So, what are the common denominators,in these three cultures?,What are the things that they all do?,And we managed to boil it down to nine.,In fact we've done two more Blue Zone expeditions since this,and these common denominators hold true.,And the first one,,and I'm about to utter a heresy here,,none of them exercise,,at least the way we think of exercise.,Instead, they set up their lives,so that they are constantly nudged into physical activity.,These 100-year-old Okinawan women,are getting up and down off the ground, they sit on the floor,,30 or 40 times a day. 
 Sardinians live in vertical houses, up and down the stairs.,Every trip to the store, or to church,or to a friend's house occasions a walk.,They don't have any conveniences.,There is not a button to push to do yard work or house work.,If they want to mix up a cake, they're doing it by hand.,That's physical activity.,That burns calories just as much as going on the treadmill does.,When they do do intentional physical activity,,it's the things they enjoy. They tend to walk,,the only proven way to stave off cognitive decline,,and they all tend to have a garden.,They know how to set up their life in the right way,so they have the right outlook. 
 Each of these cultures take time to downshift.,The Sardinians pray. The Seventh-Day Adventists pray.,The Okinawans have this ancestor veneration.,But when you're in a hurry or stressed out,,that triggers something called the inflammatory response,,which is associated with everything from Alzheimer's,disease to cardiovascular disease.,When you slow down for 15 minutes a day,you turn that inflammatory state,into a more anti-inflammatory state. 
 They have vocabulary for sense of purpose,,ikigai, like the Okinawans.,You know the two most dangerous years in your life,are the year you're born, because of infant mortality,,and the year you retire.,These people know their sense of purpose,,and they activate in their life, that's worth about seven years,of extra life expectancy. 
 There's no longevity diet.,Instead, these people drink a little bit every day,,not a hard sell to the American population.,(Laughter),They tend to eat a plant-based diet.,Doesn't mean they don't eat meat, but lots of beans and nuts.,And they have strategies to keep from overeating,,little things that nudge them away from the table at the right time. 
 And then the foundation of all this is how they connect.,They put their families first,,take care of their children and their aging parents.,They all tend to belong to a faith-based community,,which is worth between four and 14,extra years of life expectancy,if you do it four times a month.,And the biggest thing here,is they also belong to the right tribe.,They were either born into,or they proactively surrounded themselves with the right people. 
 We know from the Framingham studies,,that if your three best friends are obese,there is a 50 percent better chance that you'll be overweight.,So, if you hang out with unhealthy people,,that's going to have a measurable impact over time.,Instead, if your friend's idea of recreation,is physical activity, bowling, or playing hockey,,biking or gardening,,if your friends drink a little, but not too much,,and they eat right, and they're engaged, and they're trusting and trustworthy,,that is going to have the biggest impact over time. 
 Diets don't work. No diet in the history of the world,has ever worked for more than two percent of the population.,Exercise programs usually start in January;,they're usually done by October.,When it comes to longevity,there is no short term fix,in a pill or anything else.,But when you think about it,,your friends are long-term adventures,,and therefore, perhaps the most significant thing you can do,to add more years to your life,,and life to your years. Thank you very much.,(Applause)Today I want to talk to you about,swimming across the North Pole,,across the most northern place in the whole world.,And perhaps the best place to start is with my late father.,He was a great storyteller.,He could tell a story about an event,,and so you felt you were absolutely there at the moment.,And one of the stories he told me so often when I was a young boy,was of the first British atomic bomb test.,He had been there and watched it go off. 
 And he said that the explosion was so loud,and the light was so intense,,that he actually had to put his hands in front of his face to protect his eyes.,And he said that he could actually see an x-ray,of his fingers,,because the light was so bright.,And I know that watching that atomic bomb going off,had a very, very big impact on my late father.,Every holiday I had as a young boy,was in a national park.,What he was trying to do with me was to inspire me,to protect the world,,and show me just how fragile the world is. 
 He also told me about the great explorers.,He loved history. He would tell me about Captain Scott,walking all the way to the South Pole,and Sir Edmund Hillary climbing up Mount Everest.,And so ever since I think I was just six years old,,I dreamed of going to the polar regions.,I really, really wanted to go to the Arctic.,There was something about that place,which drew me to it.,And, well, sometimes it takes a long time,for a dream to come true.,But seven years ago, I went to the Arctic,for the first time.,And it was so beautiful that I've been back there,ever since, for the last seven years.,I love the place. 
 But I have seen that place change,beyond all description,,just in that short period of time.,I have seen polar bears walking across very, very thin ice,in search of food.,I have swum in front of glaciers,which have retreated so much.,And I have also, every year,,seen less and less sea ice.,And I wanted the world to know what was happening up there. 
 In the two years before my swim,,23 percent of the arctic sea ice cover,just melted away.,And I wanted to really shake the lapels of world leaders,to get them to understand what is happening.,So I decided to do this symbolic swim,at the top of the world, in a place which should be frozen over,,but which now is rapidly unfreezing.,And the message was very clear:,Climate change is for real,,and we need to do something about it.,And we need to do something about it right now. 
 Well, swimming across the North Pole,,it's not an ordinary thing to do.,I mean, just to put it in perspective,,27 degrees is the temperature of a normal indoor swimming pool.,This morning, the temperature of the English Channel was 18 degrees.,The passengers who fell off the Titanic,fell into water of just five degrees centigrade.,Fresh water freezes at zero.,And the water at the North Pole is minus 1.7.,It's fucking freezing.,(Laughter),(Applause),I'm sorry, but there is no other way to describe it.,(Laughter) 
 And so I had to assemble an incredible team around me,to help me with this task.,I assembled this team of 29 people from 10 nations.,Some people think that swimming is a very solo sport,,you just dive into the sea and off you go.,It couldn't be further from the truth for me.,And I then went and did a huge amount of training,,swimming in icy water, backwards and forwards. 
 But the most important thing was to train my mind,to prepare myself for what was going to happen.,And I had to visualize the swim.,I had to see it from the beginning all the way to the end.,I had to taste the salt water in my mouth.,I had to see my coach screaming for me,,"Come on Lewis! Come on! Go! Go! Go! Don't slow down!",And so I literally swam across the North Pole,hundreds and hundreds of times in my mind. 
 And then, after a year of training, I felt ready.,I felt confident that I could actually,do this swim.,So myself and the five members of the team,,we hitched a ride on an icebreaker,which was going to the North Pole.,And on day four, we decided to just do a quick,five minute test swim.,I had never swum in water of minus 1.7 degrees before,,because it's just impossible to train,in those types of conditions.,So we stopped the ship, as you do.,We all got down onto the ice,,and I then got into my swimming costume,and I dived into the sea. 
 I have never in my life felt anything,like that moment.,I could barely breathe. I was gasping for air.,I was hyperventilating so much,,and within seconds my hands were numb.,And it was -- the paradox is,that you're in freezing cold water,,but actually you're on fire.,I swam as hard as I could for five minutes.,I remember just trying to get out of the water.,I climbed out of the ice.,And I remember taking the goggles off my face,and looking down at my hands in sheer shock,,because my fingers,had swollen so much that they were like sausages.,And they were swollen so much, I couldn't even close them. 
 What had happened is that we are made partially of water,,and when water freezes it expands.,And so what had actually happened is,that the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded.,And they had burst. And I was in so much agony.,I immediately got rushed onto the ship and into a hot shower. 
 And I remember standing underneath the hot shower,and trying to defrost my fingers.,And I thought, in two days' time, I was going to do this swim across the North Pole.,I was going to try and do a 20-minute swim,,for one kilometer across the North Pole.,And this dream which I had had ever since I was a young boy,with my father, was just going out the window.,There is no possibility that this was going to happen.,And I remember then getting out of the shower,and realizing I couldn't even feel my hands.,And for a swimmer, you need to feel your hands,because you need to be able to grab the water,and pull it through with you. 
 The next morning, I woke up,and I was in such a state of depression,,and all I could think about was Sir Ranulph Fiennes.,For those of you who don't know him, he's the great British explorer.,A number of years ago, he tried to ski all the way to the North Pole.,He accidentally fell through the ice into the sea.,And after just three minutes in that water,,he was able,to get himself out.,And his hands were so badly frostbitten,that he had to return to England.,He went to a local hospital and there they said,,"Ran, there is no possibility,of us being able to save these fingers.,We are going to actually have to take them off.",And Ran decided to go into his tool shed,and take out a saw,and do it himself. 
 And all I could think of was, if that happened to Ran after three minutes,,and I can't feel my hands after five minutes,,what on earth is going to happen if I try 20 minutes?,At the very best, I'm going to end up losing some fingers.,And at worst, I didn't even want to think about it.,We carried on sailing through the ice packs towards the North Pole. 
 And my close friend David, he saw the way I was thinking,,and he came up to me and he said, "Lewis,,I've known you since you were 18 years old.,I've known you, and I know, Lewis,,deep down, right deep down here,,that you are going to make this swim.,I so believe in you Lewis. I've seen the way you've been training.,And I realize the reason why you're going to do this.,This is such an important swim.,We stand at a very, very important moment in this history,,and you're going to make a symbolic swim here,to try to shake the lapels of world leaders.,Lewis, have the courage to go in there,,because we are going to look after you every moment of it." 
 And I just, I got so much confidence from him saying that,,because he knew me so well.,So we carried on sailing and we arrived at the North Pole.,And we stopped the ship,,and it was just as the scientists had predicted.,There were open patches of sea everywhere.,And I went down into my cabin,and I put on my swimming costume.,And then the doctor strapped on a chest monitor,,which measures my core body temperature,and my heart rate.,And then we walked out onto the ice. 
 And I remember looking into the ice,,and there were big chunks of white ice in there,,and the water was completely black.,I had never seen black water before.,And it is 4,200 meters deep.,And I said to myself, "Lewis, don't look left, don't look right.,Just scuttle forward and go for it.",And so I now want to show you a short video,of what happened there on the ice. 
 Narrator (Video): We're just sailing out of harbor now, and it's at this stage,when one can have a bit of a wobble mentally.,Everything just looks so gray around here,,and looks so cold.,We've just seen our first polar bears.,It was absolutely magical.,A mother and a cub, such a beautiful sight.,And to think that in 30, 40 years,they could become extinct.,It's a very frightening, very, very frightening thought.,We're finally at the North Pole. This is,months and months and months of dreaming to get here,,years of training and planning and preparation.,Ooh. In a couple of hours' time I'm going to get in here and do my swim.,It's all a little bit frightening,,and emotional.,Amundson, you ready? Amudson: Ready.,Lewis Pugh: Ten seconds to swim. Ten seconds to swim.,Take the goggles off. Take the goggles off! 
 Man: Take the shoes. Take the shoes.,Well done lad! You did it! You did it Lewis!,You did it! You did it man! 
 LP: How on earth did we do that? 
 Man: Against the current! You did it against the current! 
 (Applause) 
 LP: Thank you very much. Thank you very much.,(Applause),Thank you so much. 
 Audience: Encore!,(Laughter) 
 LP: I'd just like to end off by just saying this:,It took me four months again to feel my hands.,But was it worth it? Yes, absolutely it was.,There are very, very few people who don't know now,about what is happening in the Arctic.,And people ask me, "Lewis, what can we do about climate change?" 
 And I say to them,,I think we need to do three things.,The first thing we need to do is we need to break this problem down,into manageable chunks.,You saw during that video all those flags.,Those flags represented the countries,from which my team came from.,And equally, when it comes to climate change,,every single country is going to have to make cuts.,Britain, America, Japan,,South Africa, the Congo.,All of us together, we're all on the same ship together. 
 The second thing we need to do is,we need to just look back,at how far we have come,in such a short period of time.,I remember, just a few years ago, speaking about climate change,,and people heckling me in the back,and saying it doesn't even exist.,I've just come back from giving a series of speeches,in some of the poorest townships in South Africa,to young children as young as 10 years old.,Four or five children sitting behind a desk,,and even in those poorest conditions,,they all have a very, very good grasp,of climate change. 
 We need to believe in ourselves.,Now is the time to believe.,We've come a long way. We're doing good.,But the most important thing we must do,is, I think, we must all walk to the end of our lives,and turn around, and ask ourselves a most fundamental question.,And that is, "What type of world do we want to live in,,and what decision are we going to make today,to ensure that we all live,in a sustainable world?",Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very, very much.,(Applause)So the first robotnto talk about is called STriDER.,It stands for Self-excitednTripedal Dynamic Experimental Robot.,It's a robot that has three legs,nwhich is inspired by nature.,But have you seen anything in nature,nan animal that has three legs?,Probably not. So why do I call thisna biologically inspired robot?,How would it work?,But before that,nlet's look at pop culture.,So, you know H.G. Wells'sn"War of the Worlds," novel and movie.,And what you see over herenis a very popular video game,,and in this fiction, they describenthese alien creatures and robots,that have three legs that terrorize Earth.,But my robot, STriDER,ndoes not move like this. 
 This is an actual dynamicnsimulation animation.,I'm going to show you how the robot works.,It flips its body 180 degrees,and it swings its leg between the two legs,and catches the fall.,So that's how it walks.,But when you look at usnhuman beings, bipedal walking,,what you're doing is,,you're not really using musclento lift your leg and walk like a robot.,What you're doing is,nyou swing your leg and catch the fall,,stand up again, swing your legnand catch the fall.,You're using your built-in dynamics,nthe physics of your body,,just like a pendulum.,We call that the conceptnof passive dynamic locomotion.,What you're doing is, when you stand up,,potential energy to kinetic energy,,potential energy to kinetic energy.,It's a constantly falling process.,So even though there is nothingnin nature that looks like this,,really, we're inspired by biologynand applying the principles of walking,to this robot.,Thus, it's a biologically inspired robot. 
 What you see here,nthis is what we want to do next.,We want to fold up the legsnand shoot it up for long-range motion.,And it deploys legs --nit looks almost like "Star Wars" --,so when it lands, it absorbsnthe shock and starts walking.,What you see over here, this yellow thing,nthis is not a death ray. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is just to show you,that if you have camerasnor different types of sensors,,because it's 1.8 meters tall,,you can see over obstacles like bushesnand those kinds of things. 
 So we have two prototypes.,The first version,nin the back, that's STriDER I.,The one in front,nthe smaller, is STriDER II.,The problem we had with STriDER I is,nit was just too heavy in the body.,We had so many motors aligning the joints,and those kinds of things.,So we decided to synthesizena mechanical mechanism,so we could get rid of all the motors,nand with a single motor,,we can coordinate all the motions.,It's a mechanical solution to a problem,ninstead of using mechatronics.,So with this, now the top bodynis lighted up; it's walking in our lab.,This was the very first successful step.,It's still not perfected,nits coffee falls down,,so we still have a lot of work to do. 
 The second robot I wantnto talk about is called IMPASS.,It stands for Intelligent MobilitynPlatform with Actuated Spoke System.,It's a wheel-leg hybrid robot.,So think of a rimless wheelnor a spoke wheel,,but the spokes individuallynmove in and out of the hub;,so, it's a wheel-leg hybrid.,We're literally reinventingnthe wheel here.,Let me demonstrate how it works.,So in this video we're using an approachncalled the reactive approach.,Just simply usingnthe tactile sensors on the feet,,it's trying to walknover a changing terrain,,a soft terrain where it pushesndown and changes.,And just by the tactile information,,it successfully crossesnover these types of terrains. 
 But, when it encountersna very extreme terrain --,in this case, this obstaclenis more than three times the height,of the robot --,then it switches to a deliberate mode,,where it uses a laser range findernand camera systems,to identify the obstacle and the size.,And it carefully plansnthe motion of the spokes,and coordinates it so it can shownthis very impressive mobility.,You probably haven't seennanything like this out there.,This is a very high-mobility robotnthat we developed called IMPASS.,Ah, isn't that cool? 
 When you drive your car,,when you steer your car, you usena method called Ackermann steering.,The front wheels rotate like this.,For most small-wheeled robots,,they use a methodncalled differential steering,where the left and right wheelnturn the opposite direction.,For IMPASS, we can do many,nmany different types of motion.,For example, in this case,,even though the left and rightnwheels are connected,with a single axle rotatingnat the same angle of velocity,,we simply change the lengthnof the spoke, it affects the diameter,,then can turn to the leftnand to the right.,These are just some examplesnof the neat things we can do with IMPASS. 
 This robot is called CLIMBeR:,Cable-suspended Limbed IntelligentnMatching Behavior Robot.,I've been talkingnto a lot of NASA JPL scientists --,at JPL, they are famousnfor the Mars rovers --,and the scientists,ngeologists always tell me,that the real interesting science,nthe science-rich sites,,are always at the cliffs.,But the current rovers cannot get there.,So, inspired by that,nwe wanted to build a robot,that can climbna structured cliff environment. 
 So this is CLIMBeR.,It has three legs.,It's probably difficult to see, but it hasna winch and a cable at the top.,It tries to figure outnthe best place to put its foot.,And then once it figures that out,,in real time, it calculatesnthe force distribution:,how much force it needsnto exert to the surface,so it doesn't tip and doesn't slip.,Once it stabilizes that, it lifts a foot,,and then with the winch,nit can climb up these kinds of cliffs.,Also for search and rescuenapplications as well. 
 Five years ago,nI actually worked at NASA JPL,during the summer as a faculty fellow.,And they already hadna six-legged robot called LEMUR.,So this is actually based on that.,This robot is called MARS:,Multi-Appendage Robotic System.,It's a hexapod robot.,We developed our adaptive gait planner.,We actually have a very interestingnpayload on there.,The students like to have fun.,And here you can see that it's walkingnover unstructured terrain. 
 (Motor sound) 
 It's trying to walknon the coastal terrain, a sandy area,,but depending on the moisture contentnor the grain size of the sand,,the foot's soil sinkage model changes,nso it tries to adapt its gait,to successfully crossnover these kind of things.,It also does some fun stuff.,As you can imagine,nwe get so many visitors visiting our lab.,So when the visitors come,nMARS walks up to the computer,,starts typing, "Hello, my name is MARS.,Welcome to RoMeLa,,the Robotics MechanismsnLaboratory at Virginia Tech." 
 (Laughter) 
 This robot is an amoeba robot.,Now, we don't have enough timento go into technical details,,I'll just show younsome of the experiments.,These are some of the earlynfeasibility experiments.,We store potential energynto the elastic skin to make it move,,or use active tension cordsnto make it move forward and backward.,It's called ChIMERA.,We also have been workingnwith some scientists and engineers,from UPenn,to come up with a chemically actuatednversion of this amoeba robot.,We do something to something,,and just like magic, it moves.,"The Blob." 
 This robot is a very recent project.,It's called RAPHaEL:,Robotic Air-Powered Handnwith Elastic Ligaments.,There are a lot of really neat,nvery good robotic hands,out there on the market.,The problem is,nthey're just too expensive --,tens of thousands of dollars.,So for prosthesis applicationsnit's probably not too practical,,because it's not affordable.,We wanted to tackle this problemnin a very different direction.,Instead of using electrical motors,nelectromechanical actuators,,we're using compressed air.,We developed these novel actuatorsnfor the joints, so it's compliant.,You can actually change the force,,simply just changing the air pressure.,And it can actually crushnan empty soda can.,It can pick up very delicatenobjects like a raw egg,,or in this case, a lightbulb.,The best part: it took only 200 dollarsnto make the first prototype. 
 This robot is actuallyna family of snake robots,that we call HyDRAS,,Hyper Degrees-of-freedom RoboticnArticulated Serpentine.,This is a robot that can climb structures.,This is a HyDRAS's arm.,It's a 12-degrees-of-freedom robotic arm.,But the cool part is the user interface.,The cable over there,nthat's an optical fiber.,This student, it's probablynher first time using it,,but she can articulate itnin many different ways.,So, for example, in Iraq, the war zone,nthere are roadside bombs.,Currently, you send these remotelyncontrolled vehicles that are armed.,It takes really a lot of timenand it's expensive to train the operator,to operate this complex arm.,In this case, it's very intuitive;,this student, probablynhis first time using it,,is doing very complex manipulation tasks,,picking up objects and doingnmanipulation, just like that.,Very intuitive. 
 Now, this robotnis currently our star robot.,We actually have a fan clubnfor the robot, DARwIn:,Dynamic AnthropomorphicnRobot with Intelligence.,As you know, we're very interestednin human walking,,so we decided to buildna small humanoid robot.,This was in 2004; at that time,,this was something really,nreally revolutionary.,This was more of a feasibility study:,What kind of motors should we use?nIs it even possible?,What kinds of controls should we do?,This does not have any sensors,nso it's an open-loop control.,For those who probably know,nif you don't have any sensors,and there's any disturbances,nyou know what happens. 
 (Laughter) 
 Based on that success, the following yearnwe did the proper mechanical design,,starting from kinematics.,And thus, DARwIn I was born in 2005.,It stands up, it walks -- very impressive.,However, still, as you can see,nit has a cord, an umbilical cord.,So we're still usingnan external power source,and external computation. 
 So in 2006, now it's reallyntime to have fun.,Let's give it intelligence.,We give it all the computingnpower it needs:,a 1.5 gigahertz Pentium M chip,ntwo FireWire cameras,,rate gyros, accelerometers,nfour forced sensors on the foot,,lithium polymer batteries --,and now DARwIn IInis completely autonomous.,It is not remote controlled.nThere's no tethers.,It looks around, searches for the ball ...nlooks around, searches for the ball,,and it tries to play a game of soccernautonomously -- artificial intelligence.,Let's see how it does.,This was our very first trial, and ... 
 (Video) Spectators: Goal! 
 Dennis Hong: There is actuallyna competition called RoboCup.,I don't know how many of younhave heard about RoboCup.,It's an international autonomousnrobot soccer competition.,And the actual goal of RoboCup is,,by the year 2050,,we want to have full-size,nautonomous humanoid robots,play soccer against the humannWorld Cup champions,and win. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's a true, actual goal.,It's a very ambitious goal,nbut we truly believe we can do it. 
 This is last year in China.,We were the very first teamnin the United States that qualified,in the humanoid RoboCup competition.,This is this year in Austria.,You're going to see the actionnis three against three,,completely autonomous. 
 (Video) (Crowd groans) 
 DH: There you go. Yes!,The robots track and they team-playnamongst themselves.,It's very impressive.,It's really a research event,,packaged in a more excitingncompetition event.,What you see here is the beautifulnLouis Vuitton Cup trophy.,This is for the best humanoid.,We'd like to bring this, for the firstntime, to the United States next year,,so wish us luck. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 DARwIn also has a lot of other talents.,Last year, it actually conductednthe Roanoke Symphony Orchestra,for the holiday concert.,This is the next generationnrobot, DARwIn IV,,much smarter, faster, stronger.,And it's trying to show off its ability:,"I'm macho, I'm strong." 
 (Laughter) 
 "I can also do some Jackie Chan-motion,nmartial art movements." 
 (Laughter) 
 And it walks away. So this is DARwIn IV.,Again, you'll be ablento see it in the lobby.,We truly believe this will benthe very first running humanoid robot,in the United States.,So stay tuned. 
 All right. So I showed younsome of our exciting robots at work.,So, what is the secret of our success?,Where do we come up with these ideas?,How do we develop these kinds of ideas?,We have a fully autonomous vehicle,that can drive into urban environments.,We won a half a million dollarsnin the DARPA Urban Challenge.,We also have the world's very firstnvehicle that can be driven by the blind.,We call it the Blind DrivernChallenge, very exciting.,And many, many other roboticsnprojects I want to talk about.,These are just the awardsnthat we won in 2007 fall,from robotics competitionsnand those kinds of things. 
 So really, we have five secrets.,First is: Where do we get inspiration?,Where do we get this spark of imagination?,This is a true story, my personal story.,At night, when I go to bed,nat three, four in the morning,,I lie down, close my eyes,nand I see these lines and circles,and different shapes floating around.,And they assemble, and they formnthese kinds of mechanisms.,And I think, "Ah, this is cool.",So right next to my bednI keep a notebook, a journal,,with a special pennthat has an LED light on it,,because I don't want to turn on the lightnand wake up my wife. 
 So I see this, scribble everything down,ndraw things, and go to bed.,Every day in the morning,nthe first thing I do,,before my first cup of coffee,nbefore I brush my teeth,,I open my notebook.,Many times it's empty;nsometimes I have something there.,If something's there, sometimes it's junk.,But most of the time,nI can't read my handwriting.,Four in the morning --nwhat do you expect, right?,So I need to decipher what I wrote.,But sometimes I seenthis ingenious idea in there,,and I have this eureka moment.,I directly run to my home office,nsit at my computer,,I type in the ideas, I sketch things out,and I keep a database of ideas.,So when we have these calls for proposals,,I try to find a matchnbetween my potential ideas,and the problem.,If there's a match,nwe write a research proposal,,get the research funding in,,and that's how we startnour research programs. 
 But just a spark of imaginationnis not good enough.,How do we develop these kinds of ideas?,At our lab RoMeLa, the Roboticsnand Mechanisms Laboratory,,we have these fantasticnbrainstorming sessions.,So we gather around, we discuss problemsnand solutions and talk about it.,But before we start,nwe set this golden rule.,The rule is:,nobody criticizes anybody's ideas.,Nobody criticizes any opinion.,This is important, because many times,nstudents fear or feel uncomfortable,about how others might thinknabout their opinions and thoughts. 
 So once you do this, it is amazingnhow the students open up.,They have these wacky, cool,ncrazy, brilliant ideas,,and the whole room is just electrifiednwith creative energy.,And this is how we develop our ideas. 
 Well, we're running out of time.,One more thing I want to talk about is,,you know, just a spark of ideanand development is not good enough.,There was a great TED moment --nI think it was Sir Ken Robinson, was it?,He gave a talk about how educationnand school kill creativity.,Well, actually,nthere's two sides to the story.,So there is only so much one can donwith just ingenious ideas,and creativitynand good engineering intuition.,If you want to go beyond a tinkering,,if you want to gonbeyond a hobby of robotics,and really tacklenthe grand challenges of robotics,through rigorous research,,we need more than that.,This is where school comes in. 
 Batman, fighting against the bad guys,,he has his utility belt,nhe has his grappling hook,,he has all different kinds of gadgets.,For us roboticists,nengineers and scientists,,these tools are the coursesnand classes you take in class.,Math, differential equations.,I have linear algebra, science, physics --,even, nowadays, chemistrynand biology, as you've seen.,These are all the tools we need.,So the more tools you have, for Batman,,more effective at fighting the bad guys,,for us, more tools to attacknthese kinds of big problems.,So education is very important. 
 Also -- it's not only about that.,You also have to work really, really hard.,So I always tell my students,,"Work smart, then work hard.",This picture in the back --nthis is three in the morning.,I guarantee if you comento our lab at 3, 4am,,we have students working there,,not because I tell them to,nbut because we are having too much fun.,Which leads to the last topic:,do not forget to have fun.,That's really the secret of our success,nwe're having too much fun.,I truly believe that highest productivityncomes when you're having fun,,and that's what we're doing.,And there you go. 
 Thank you so much. 
 (Applause)How do you explainnwhen things don't go as we assume?,Or better, how do you explain,when others are able to achieve thingsnthat seem to defy all of the assumptions?,For example:,Why is Apple so innovative?,Year after year, after year,,they're more innovativenthan all their competition.,And yet, they're just a computer company.,They're just like everyone else.,They have the same accessnto the same talent,,the same agencies,,the same consultants, the same media.,Then why is it that they seemnto have something different?,Why is it that Martin Luther Kingnled the Civil Rights Movement?,He wasn't the only mannwho suffered in pre-civil rights America,,and he certainly wasn'tnthe only great orator of the day.,Why him?,And why is it that the Wright brothers,were able to figure out controlled,npowered man flight,when there were certainly other teams,who were better qualified,nbetter funded --,and they didn't achievenpowered man flight,,and the Wright brothers beat them to it.,There's something else at play here. 
 About three and a half years ago,nI made a discovery.,And this discovery profoundly changednmy view on how I thought the world worked,,and it even profoundly changed the waynin which I operate in it.,As it turns out, there's a pattern.,As it turns out, all the great inspiringnleaders and organizations in the world,,whether it's Apple or Martin Luther Kingnor the Wright brothers,,they all think, act and communicatenthe exact same way.,And it's the complete oppositento everyone else.,All I did was codify it,,and it's probablynthe world's simplest idea.,I call it the golden circle. 
 Why? How? What?,This little idea explains,why some organizations and some leadersnare able to inspire where others aren't.,Let me define the terms really quickly.,Every single person, every singlenorganization on the planet,knows what they do, 100 percent.,Some know how they do it,,whether you call itnyour differentiated value proposition,or your proprietary process or your USP.,But very, very few people or organizationsnknow why they do what they do.,And by "why" I don't meann"to make a profit.",That's a result. It's always a result.,By "why," I mean: What's your purpose?,What's your cause? What's your belief?,Why does your organization exist?,Why do you get out of bed in the morning?,And why should anyone care?,As a result, the way we think, we act,,the way we communicatenis from the outside in, it's obvious.,We go from the clearest thingnto the fuzziest thing.,But the inspired leadersnand the inspired organizations --,regardless of their size,nregardless of their industry --,all think, act and communicatenfrom the inside out. 
 Let me give you an example.,I use Apple because they're easynto understand and everybody gets it.,If Apple were like everyone else,,a marketing message from themnmight sound like this:,"We make great computers.,They're beautifully designed,nsimple to use and user friendly.,Want to buy one?","Meh.",That's how most of us communicate.,That's how most marketingnand sales are done,,that's how we communicate interpersonally.,We say what we do,,we say how we're different or better,and we expect some sort of a behavior,,a purchase, a vote, something like that.,Here's our new law firm:,We have the best lawyersnwith the biggest clients,,we always perform for our clients.,Here's our new car:,It gets great gas mileage,nit has leather seats.,Buy our car.,But it's uninspiring. 
 Here's how Apple actually communicates.,"Everything we do,nwe believe in challenging the status quo.,We believe in thinking differently.,The way we challenge the status quo,is by making our productsnbeautifully designed,,simple to use and user friendly.,We just happen to make great computers.,Want to buy one?",Totally different, right?,You're ready to buy a computer from me.,I just reversednthe order of the information.,What it proves to us isnthat people don't buy what you do;,people buy why you do it. 
 This explains whynevery single person in this room,is perfectly comfortable buyingna computer from Apple.,But we're also perfectly comfortable,buying an MP3 player from Apple,nor a phone from Apple,,or a DVR from Apple.,As I said before,nApple's just a computer company.,Nothing distinguishes them structurallynfrom any of their competitors.,Their competitors are equally qualifiednto make all of these products.,In fact, they tried.,A few years ago, Gatewayncame out with flat-screen TVs.,They're eminently qualifiednto make flat-screen TVs.,They've been makingnflat-screen monitors for years.,Nobody bought one.,Dell came out with MP3 players and PDAs,,and they make great quality products,,and they can make perfectlynwell-designed products --,and nobody bought one.,In fact, talking about it now,nwe can't even imagine,buying an MP3 player from Dell.,Why would you buy onenfrom a computer company?,But we do it every day.,People don't buy what you do;nthey buy why you do it.,The goal is not to do businessnwith everybody who needs what you have.,The goal is to do business with peoplenwho believe what you believe. 
 Here's the best part:,None of what I'm telling younis my opinion.,It's all groundednin the tenets of biology.,Not psychology, biology.,If you look at a cross-sectionnof the human brain,,from the top down,nthe human brain is actually broken,into three major components,that correlate perfectlynwith the golden circle.,Our newest brain, our Homo sapien brain,,our neocortex,,corresponds with the "what" level.,The neocortex is responsible,for all of our rationalnand analytical thought and language.,The middle two sections make upnour limbic brains,,and our limbic brains are responsiblenfor all of our feelings,,like trust and loyalty.,It's also responsiblenfor all human behavior,,all decision-making,,and it has no capacity for language. 
 In other words, when we communicatenfrom the outside in,,yes, people can understand vastnamounts of complicated information,like features and benefitsnand facts and figures.,It just doesn't drive behavior.,When we can communicatenfrom the inside out,,we're talking directlynto the part of the brain,that controls behavior,,and then we allow people to rationalize itnwith the tangible things we say and do.,This is where gut decisions come from.,Sometimes you can give somebodynall the facts and figures,,and they say, "I knownwhat all the facts and details say,,but it just doesn't feel right.",Why would we use that verb,nit doesn't "feel" right?,Because the part of the brainnthat controls decision-making,doesn't control language.,The best we can muster up is,,"I don't know. nIt just doesn't feel right.",Or sometimes you say you're leadingnwith your heart or soul.,I hate to break it to you,nthose aren't other body parts,controlling your behavior.,It's all happening herenin your limbic brain,,the part of the brain that controlsndecision-making and not language. 
 But if you don't knownwhy you do what you do,,and people respondnto why you do what you do,,then how will you ever get people,to vote for you,nor buy something from you,,or, more importantly, be loyal,and want to be a partnof what it is that you do.,The goal is not just to sellnto people who need what you have;,the goal is to sell to peoplenwho believe what you believe.,The goal is not justnto hire people who need a job;,it's to hire peoplenwho believe what you believe.,I always say that, you know,,if you hire people just because they canndo a job, they'll work for your money,,but if they believe what you believe,,they'll work for you with bloodnand sweat and tears.,Nowhere else is there a better examplenthan with the Wright brothers. 
 Most people don't knownabout Samuel Pierpont Langley.,And back in the early 20th century,,the pursuit of powered man flightnwas like the dot com of the day.,Everybody was trying it.,And Samuel Pierpont Langleynhad, what we assume,,to be the recipe for success.,Even now, you ask people,,"Why did your productnor why did your company fail?",and people always givenyou the same permutation,of the same three things:,under-capitalized, the wrong people,nbad market conditions.,It's always the same three things,nso let's explore that.,Samuel Pierpont Langley,was given 50,000 dollarsnby the War Department,to figure out this flying machine.,Money was no problem.,He held a seat at Harvard,and worked at the Smithsoniannand was extremely well-connected;,he knew all the big minds of the day.,He hired the best minds money could find,and the market conditions were fantastic.,The New York Timesnfollowed him around everywhere,,and everyone was rooting for Langley.,Then how come we've never heardnof Samuel Pierpont Langley? 
 A few hundred miles away in Dayton, Ohio,,Orville and Wilbur Wright,,they had none of what we considernto be the recipe for success.,They had no money;,they paid for their dreamnwith the proceeds from their bicycle shop.,Not a single personnon the Wright brothers' team,had a college education,,not even Orville or Wilbur.,And The New York Timesnfollowed them around nowhere. 
 The difference was,,Orville and Wilbur were driven by a cause,nby a purpose, by a belief.,They believed that if they couldnfigure out this flying machine,,it'll change the course of the world.,Samuel Pierpont Langley was different.,He wanted to be rich,nand he wanted to be famous.,He was in pursuit of the result.,He was in pursuit of the riches.,And lo and behold, look what happened.,The people who believednin the Wright brothers' dream,worked with them with bloodnand sweat and tears.,The others just worked for the paycheck.,They tell stories of how every timenthe Wright brothers went out,,they would have to takenfive sets of parts,,because that's how many timesnthey would crash before supper. 
 And, eventually, on December 17th, 1903,,the Wright brothers took flight,,and no one was therento even experience it.,We found out about it a few days later.,And further proof that Langleynwas motivated by the wrong thing:,the day the Wright brothers took flight,,he quit.,He could have said,,"That's an amazing discovery, guys,,and I will improvenupon your technology," but he didn't.,He wasn't first, he didn't get rich,nhe didn't get famous, so he quit. 
 People don't buy what you do;nthey buy why you do it.,If you talk about what you believe,,you will attract thosenwho believe what you believe. 
 But why is it important to attractnthose who believe what you believe?,Something called the lawnof diffusion of innovation,,if you don't know the law,nyou know the terminology.,The first 2.5\% of our populationnare our innovators.,The next 13.5\% of our populationnare our early adopters.,The next 34\% are your early majority,,your late majority and your laggards.,The only reason these peoplenbuy touch-tone phones,is because you can't buynrotary phones anymore. 
 (Laughter) 
 We all sit at various placesnat various times on this scale,,but what the law of diffusionnof innovation tells us,is that if you want mass-market successnor mass-market acceptance of an idea,,you cannot have itnuntil you achieve this tipping point,between 15 and 18 percentnmarket penetration,,and then the system tips.,I love asking businesses,n"What's your conversion on new business?",They love to tell you,n"It's about 10 percent," proudly.,Well, you can tripnover 10\% of the customers.,We all have about 10\% who just "get it.",That's how we describe them, right?,That's like that gut feeling,n"Oh, they just get it." 
 The problem is: How do younfind the ones that get it,before doing businessnversus the ones who don't get it?,So it's this here, this little gapnthat you have to close,,as Jeffrey Moore calls it,n"Crossing the Chasm" --,because, you see, the early majoritynwill not try something,until someone else has tried it first.,And these guys, the innovatorsnand the early adopters,,they're comfortablenmaking those gut decisions.,They're more comfortablenmaking those intuitive decisions,that are driven by whatnthey believe about the world,and not just what product is available.,These are the people who stoodnin line for six hours,to buy an iPhone when they first came out,,when you could have bought onenoff the shelf the next week.,These are the peoplenwho spent 40,000 dollars,on flat-screen TVsnwhen they first came out,,even though the technologynwas substandard.,And, by the way, they didn't do itnbecause the technology was so great;,they did it for themselves.,It's because they wanted to be first.,People don't buy what you do;nthey buy why you do it,and what you do simply provesnwhat you believe.,In fact, people will do the thingsnthat prove what they believe.,The reason that person bought the iPhonenin the first six hours,,stood in line for six hours,,was because of what they believednabout the world,,and how they wanted everybody to see them:,they were first.,People don't buy what you do;nthey buy why you do it. 
 So let me give you a famous example,,a famous failure and a famous successnof the law of diffusion of innovation.,First, the famous failure.,It's a commercial example.,As we said before, the recipe for success,is money and the right peoplenand the right market conditions.,You should have success then.,Look at TiVo.,From the time TiVo came outnabout eight or nine years ago,to this current day,,they are the single highest-qualitynproduct on the market,,hands down, there is no dispute.,They were extremely well-funded.,Market conditions were fantastic.,I mean, we use TiVo as verb.,I TiVo stuff on my piece-of-junknTime Warner DVR all the time. 
 (Laughter) 
 But TiVo's a commercial failure.,They've never made money.,And when they went IPO,,their stock was at about 30 or 40 dollars,and then plummeted,nand it's never traded above 10.,In fact, I don't thinknit's even traded above six,,except for a couple of little spikes. 
 Because you see, when TiVonlaunched their product,,they told us all what they had.,They said, "We have a productnthat pauses live TV,,skips commercials, rewinds live TVnand memorizes your viewing habits,without you even asking.",And the cynical majority said,,"We don't believe you.,We don't need it. We don't like it.,You're scaring us." 
 What if they had said,,"If you're the kind of personnwho likes to have total control,over every aspect of your life,,boy, do we have a product for you.,It pauses live TV, skips commercials,,memorizes your viewing habits, etc., etc.",People don't buy what you do;nthey buy why you do it,,and what you do simply servesnas the proof of what you believe. 
 Now let me give you a successful examplenof the law of diffusion of innovation.,In the summer of 1963,,250,000 people showed upnon the mall in Washington,to hear Dr. King speak.,They sent out no invitations,,and there was no websitento check the date.,How do you do that?,Well, Dr. Kingnwasn't the only man in America,who was a great orator.,He wasn't the only mannin America who suffered,in a pre-civil rights America.,In fact, some of his ideas were bad.,But he had a gift.,He didn't go around telling peoplenwhat needed to change in America.,He went aroundnand told people what he believed.,"I believe, I believe, I believe,"nhe told people.,And people who believed what he believed,took his cause, and they made itntheir own, and they told people.,And some of those peoplencreated structures,to get the word out to even more people.,And lo and behold,n250,000 people showed up,on the right day at the right timento hear him speak. 
 How many of them showed up for him?,Zero.,They showed up for themselves.,It's what they believed about America,that got them to travelnin a bus for eight hours,to stand in the sun in Washingtonnin the middle of August.,It's what they believed,nand it wasn't about black versus white:,25\% of the audience was white. 
 Dr. King believed that there arentwo types of laws in this world:,those that are made by a higher authoritynand those that are made by men.,And not until all the lawsnthat are made by men,are consistent with the lawsnmade by the higher authority,will we live in a just world.,It just so happenednthat the Civil Rights Movement,was the perfect thing to help himnbring his cause to life.,We followed, not for him,nbut for ourselves.,By the way, he gaventhe "I have a dream" speech,,not the "I have a plan" speech. 
 (Laughter) 
 Listen to politicians now,nwith their comprehensive 12-point plans.,They're not inspiring anybody.,Because there are leadersnand there are those who lead.,Leaders hold a positionnof power or authority,,but those who lead inspire us.,Whether they're individualsnor organizations,,we follow those who lead,nnot because we have to,,but because we want to.,We follow those who lead, not for them,nbut for ourselves.,And it's those who start with "why",that have the abilitynto inspire those around them,or find others who inspire them. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I'm going to talk,about some of my discoveries,around the world through my work.,These are not discoveries of planets,or new technologies,or science.,They're discoveries of people,and the way people are, and new leadership. 
 This is Benki.,Benki is a leader of the Ashaninka Nation.,His people live in Brazil,and in Peru.,Benki comes from a village,so remote up in the Amazon,that to get there, either you have to fly,and land on water,,or go by canoe for several days.,I met Benki three years ago in Sao Paulo,when I'd brought him and other leaders,from indigenous peoples,to meet with me and leaders from around the world,,because we wanted to learn from each other.,We wanted to share our stories with each other. 
 The Ashaninka people,are known throughout South America,for their dignity, their spirit,and their resistance,,starting with the Incas,and continuing through the 19th century,with the rubber tappers.,Today's biggest threat to the Ashaninka people,and to Benki,comes from illegal logging --,the people who come into the beautiful forest,and cut down ancient mahogany trees,,float them down the river to world markets.,Benki knew this.,He could see what was happening to his forest, to his environment,,because he was taken under his grandfather's wing,when he was only two years old,to begin to learn about the forest,and the way of life of his people.,His grandfather died when he was only 10.,And at that young age, 10 years old,,Benki became the paje of his community.,Now, in the Ashaninka tradition and culture,,the paje is the most important,person in the community.,This is the person who contains within him,all the knowledge, all the wisdom,of centuries and centuries of life,,and not just about his people,,but about everything that his people's survival depended on:,the trees, the birds,,the water, the soil, the forest.,So when he was only 10 and he became the paje,,he began to lead his people.,He began to talk to them,about the forest that they needed to protect,,the way of life they needed to nurture.,He explained to them,that it was not a question of survival of the fittest;,it was a question of understanding,what they needed to survive,and to protect that. 
 Eight years later,,when he was a young man of 18,,Benki left the forest for the first time.,He went 3,000 miles on an odyssey to Rio,to the Earth Summit,to tell the world what was happening,in his tiny, little corner.,And he went because he hoped the world would listen.,Some did, not everybody.,But if you can imagine this young man,with his headdress and his flowing robe,,learning a new language, Portuguese,,not to mention English,,going to Rio,,building a bridge,to reach out to people he'd never met before --,a pretty hostile world.,But he wasn't dismayed. 
 Benki came back to his village full of ideas --,new technologies, new research,,new ways of understanding what was going on.,Since that time,,he's continued to work with his people,,and not only the Ashaninka Nation,,but all the peoples of the Amazon and beyond.,He's built schools,to teach children to care for the forest.,Together, he's led the reforestation,of over 25 percent of the land,that had been destroyed by the loggers.,He's created a cooperative,to help people diversify their livelihoods.,And he's brought the internet and satellite technology,to the forest --,both so that people themselves,could monitor the deforestation,,but also that he could speak from the forest,to the rest of the world.,If you were to meet Benki,and ask him, "Why are you doing this?,Why are you putting yourself at risk?,Why are you making yourself vulnerable,to what is often a hostile world?",he would tell you,,as he told me,,"I asked myself," he said,,"What did my grandparents and my great-grandparents do,to protect the forest for me?,And what am I doing?" 
 So when I think of that,,I wonder what our grandchildren,and our great-grandchildren,,when they ask themselves that question,,I wonder how they will answer.,For me, the world is veering,towards a future we don't much want,when we really think about it deep inside.,It's a future we don't know the details of,,but it's a future that has signs,,just like Benki saw the signs around him.,We know we are running out of what we need.,We're running out of fresh water.,We're running out of fossil fuels.,We're running out of land.,We know climate change is going to affect all of us.,We don't know how, but we know it will.,And we know that there will be more of us than ever before --,five times as many people in 40 years,than 60 years ago.,We are running out of what we need.,And we also know,that the world has changed in other ways,,that since 1960,there are one-third as many new countries,that exist as independent entities on the planet.,Egos, systems of government --,figuring it out --,massive change.,And in addition to that,,we know that five other really big countries,are going to have a say in the future,,a say we haven't even really started to hear yet --,China, India,,Russia, South Africa,and Benki's own Brazil,,where Benki got his civil rights,only in the 1988 constitution. 
 But you know all that.,You know more than Benki knew when he left his forest,and went 3,000 miles.,You also know,that we can't just keep doing what we've always done,,because we'll get the results,we've always gotten.,And this reminds me of something I understand,Lord Salisbury said to Queen Victoria over a hundred years ago,,when she was pressing him, "Please change.",He said, "Change?,Why change?,Things are bad enough as they are.",We have to change.,It's imperative to me, when I look around the world,,that we need to change ourselves.,We need new models of what it means to be a leader.,We need new models,of being a leader and a human in the world. 
 I started life as a banker.,Now I don't admit to that,to anybody but my very close friends.,But for the past eight years,,I've done something completely different.,My work has taken me around the world,,where I've had the real privilege,of meeting people like Benki,and many others who are making change happen,in their communities --,people who see the world differently,,who are asking different questions,,who have different answers,,who understand the filters that they wear,when they go out into the world. 
 This is Sanghamitra.,Sanghamitra comes from Bangalore.,I met Sanghamitra eight years ago,when I was in Bangalore,organizing a workshop with leaders of different NGO's,working in some of the hardest aspects of society.,Sanghamitra didn't start life,as a leader of an NGO,,she started her career as university professor,,teaching English literature.,But she realized that she was much too detached from the world doing that.,She loved it, but she was too detached.,And so in 1993,,a long time ago,,she decided to start a new organization,called Samraksha,focused on one of the hardest areas,,one of the hardest issues in India --,anywhere in the world at the time --,HIV/AIDS.,Since that time, Samraksha has grown,from strength to strength,and is now one of the leading health NGO's in India.,But if you just think about the state of the world,and knowledge of HIV/AIDS,in 1993 --,in India at that time it was skyrocketing,and nobody understood why,,and everyone was actually very, very afraid.,Today there are still three million,HIV-positive people in India.,That's the second largest population in the world. 
 When I asked Sanghamitra,,"How did you get from English literature,to HIV/AIDS?",not an obvious path,,she said to me,,"It's all connected.,Literature makes one sensitive,,sensitive to people,,to their dreams and to their ideas.",Since that time, under her leadership,,Samraksha has been a pioneer,in all fields related,to HIV/AIDS.,They have respite homes, the first,,the first care centers,,the first counseling services --,and not just in urban, 7-million-population Bangalore,,but in the hardest to reach villages,in the state of Karnataka.,Even that wasn't enough.,She wanted to change policy at the government level.,10 of their programs that she pioneered,are now government policy and funded by the government.,They take care of 20,000-odd people today,in over 1,000 villages around Karnataka. 
 She works with people like Murali Krishna.,Murali Krishna comes from one of those villages.,He lost his wife to AIDS a couple of years ago,,and he's HIV-positive.,But he saw the work, the care,,the compassion,that Sanghamitra and her team brought to the village,,and he wanted to be part of it.,He's a Leaders' Quest fellow, and that helps him with his work.,They've pioneered a different approach to villages.,Instead of handing out information in pamphlets,,as is so often the case,,they bring theater troupes,,songs, music, dance.,And they sit around,,and they talk about dreams. 
 Sanghamitra told me just last week --,she had just come back from two weeks in the villages,,and she had a real breakthrough.,They were sitting in a circle, talking about the dreams for the village.,And the young women in the village,spoke up and said, "We've changed our dream.,Our dream,is for our partners, our husbands,,not to be given to us because of a horoscope,,but to be given to us,because they've been tested for HIV.",If you are lucky enough to meet Sanghamitra,and ask her why and how,,how have you achieved so much?,She would look at you,and very quietly, very softly say,,"It just happened.,It's the spirit inside." 
 This is Dr. Fan Jianchuan.,Jianchuan comes from Sichuan Province,in southwest China.,He was born in 1957,,and you can imagine what his childhood,looked like and felt like,,and what his life has been like,over the last 50 tumultuous years.,He's been a soldier, a teacher,,a politician, a vice-mayor,and a business man.,But if you sat down and asked him, "Who are you really,,and what do you do?",He would tell you, "I'm a collector,,and I curate a museum.",I was lucky; I had heard about him for years,,and I finally met him earlier this year,at his museum in Chengdu. 
 He's been a collector all of his life,,starting when he was four or five in the early 1960's.,Now, just think of the early 1960's in China.,Over a lifetime, through everything,,through the Cultural Revolution and everything afterward,,he's kept collecting,,so that he now has over eight million pieces,in his museums,documenting contemporary Chinese history.,These are pieces that you won't find anywhere else in the world,,in part because they document parts of history,Chinese choose to forget.,For example, he's got over one million pieces,documenting the Sino-Japanese War,,a war that's not talked about in China very much,and whose heroes are not honored.,Why did he do all this?,Because he thought,a nation should never repeat the mistakes of the past. 
 So, from commissioning,slightly larger than life bronze statues,of the heroes of the Sino-Japanese War,,including those Chinese,who then fought with each other,and left mainland China to go to Taiwan,,to commemorating all the unknown,,ordinary soldiers who survived,,by asking them to take prints of their hands,,he is making sure -- one man is making sure --,that history is not forgotten.,But it's not just Chinese heroes he cares about.,This building contains the world's largest collection,of documents and artifacts,commemorating the U.S. role,in fighting on the Chinese side,in that long war --,the Flying Tigers.,He has nine other buildings --,that are already open to the public --,filled to the rafters with artifacts,documenting contemporary Chinese history.,Two of the most sensitive buildings,include a lifetime of collection,about the Cultural Revolution,,a period that actually most Chinese,would prefer to forget.,But he doesn't want his nation,ever to forget. 
 These people inspire me,,and they inspire me because they show us,what is possible when you change the way,you look at the world,,change the way you look at your place in the world.,They looked outside,,and then they changed what was on the inside.,They didn't go to business school.,They didn't read a manual, "How to Be a Good Leader,in 10 Easy Steps.",But they have qualities we'd all recognize.,They have drive, passion, commitment.,They've gone away,from what they did before,,and they've gone,to something they didn't know.,They've tried to connect worlds,they didn't know existed before.,They've built bridges, and they've walked across them.,They have a sense of the great arc of time,and their tiny place in it.,They know people have come before them,and will follow them.,And they know that they're part of a whole,,that they depend on other people.,It's not about them, they know that,,but it has to start with them.,And they have humility.,It just happens. 
 But we know it doesn't just happen, don't we?,We know it takes a lot to make it happen,,and we know the direction the world is going in.,So I think we need succession planning,on a global basis.,We can't wait for the next generation, the new joiners,,to come in and learn how to be the good leaders we need.,I think it has to start with us.,And we know, just like they knew,,how hard it is.,But the good news is that we don't have to figure it out as we go along;,we have models, we have examples,,like Benki and Sanghamitra and Jianchuan.,We can look at what they've done, if we look.,We can learn from what they've learned.,We can change the way we see ourselves in the world.,And if we're lucky,,we can change the way,our great-grandchildren,will answer Benki's question. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)One of my favorite cartoon characters is Snoopy.,I love the way he sits and lies on his kennel and contemplates the great things of life.,So when I thought about compassion,,my mind immediately went to one of the cartoon strips,,where he's lying there and he says,,"I really understand, and I really appreciate,how one should love one's neighbor as one love's oneself.,The only trouble is the people next door; I can't stand them.",This, in a way, is one of the challenges,of how to interpret a really good idea. 
 We all, I think, believe in compassion.,If you look at all the world religions, all the main world religions,,you'll find within them some teaching concerning compassion.,So in Judaism, we have, from our Torah,,that you should love your neighbor as you love yourself.,And within Jewish teachings, the rabbinic teachings, we have Hillel,,who taught that you shouldn't do to others what you don't like being done to yourself.,And all the main religions have similar teachings.,And again, within Judaism,,we have a teaching about God,,who is called the compassionate one, Ha-rachaman.,After all, how could the world exist without God being compassionate?,And we, as taught within the Torah that we are made in the image of God,,so we too have to be compassionate.,But what does it mean? How does it impact on our everyday life?,Sometimes, of course, being compassionate,can produce feelings within us that are very difficult to control. 
 I know there are many times when I've gone and conducted a funeral,,or when I have been sitting with the bereaved, or with people who are dying,,and I am overwhelmed by the sadness, by the difficulty,,the challenge that is there for the family, for the person.,And I'm touched, so that tears come to my eyes.,And yet, if I just allowed myself to be overwhelmed by these feelings,,I wouldn't be doing my job --,because I have to actually be there for them,and make sure that rituals happen, that practicalities are seen to.,And yet, on the other hand, if I didn't feel this compassion,,then I feel that it would be time for me to hang up my robe,and give up being a rabbi. 
 And these same feelings are there for all of us as we face the world.,Who cannot be touched by compassion,when we see the terrible horrors of the results of war,,or famine, or earthquakes, or tsunamis?,I know some people who say,"Well, you know there's just so much out there -- I can't do anything,,I'm not going to even begin to try.",And there are some charity workers who call this compassion fatigue.,There are others who feel they can't confront compassion anymore,,and so they turn off the television and don't watch.,In Judaism, though, we tend to always say, there has to be a middle way. 
 You have to, of course, be aware of the needs of others,,but you have to be aware in such a way that you can carry on with your life,and be of help to people.,So part of compassion has to be an understanding of what makes people tick.,And, of course, you can't do that unless you understand yourself a bit more. 
 And there's a lovely rabbinic interpretation of the beginnings of creation,,which says that when God created the world,,God thought that it would be best to create the world,only with the divine attribute of justice.,Because, after all, God is just.,Therefore, there should be justice throughout the world.,And then God looked to the future and realized,,if the world was created just with justice, the world couldn't exist. 
 So, God thought, "Nope, I'm going to create the world just with compassion.",And then God looked to the future and realized that,,in fact, if the world were just filled with compassion,,there would be anarchy and chaos.,There had to be limits to all things.,The rabbis describe this as being like a king,who has a beautiful, fragile glass bowl.,If you put too much cold water in, it will shatter.,If you put boiling water in, it will shatter.,What do you have to do? Put in a mixture of the two.,And so God put both of these possibilities into the world. 
 There is something more though that has to be there.,And that is the translation of the feelings,that we may have about compassion,into the wider world, into action.,So, like Snoopy, we can't just lie there,and think great thoughts about our neighbors.,We actually have to do something about it.,And so there is also, within Judaism, this notion of love and kindness,that becomes very important: "chesed." 
 All these three things, then, have to be melded together.,The idea of justice, which gives boundaries to our lives,and gives us a feeling of what's right about life, what's right about living,,what should we be doing, social justice.,There has to be a willingness to do good deeds,,but not, of course, at the expense of our own sanity.,You know, there's no way that you can do anything for anyone,if you overdo things.,And balancing them all in the middle is this notion of compassion,,which has to be there, if you like, at our very roots. 
 This idea of compassion comes to us,because we're made in the image of God,,who is ultimately the compassionate one.,What does this compassion entail?,It entails understanding the pain of the other.,But even more than that,,it means understanding one's connection to the whole of creation:,understanding that one is part of that creation,,that there is a unity that underlies all that we see,,all that we hear, all that we feel.,I call that unity God.,And that unity is something that connects all of creation. 
 And, of course, in the modern world, with the environmental movement,,we're becoming even more aware of the connectivity of things,,that something I do here actually does matter in Africa,,that if I use too much of my carbon allowance,,it seems to be that we are causing,a great lack of rain in central and eastern Africa.,So there is a connectivity,,and I have to understand that -- as part of the creation,,as part of me being made in the image of God.,And I have to understand that my needs,sometimes have to be sublimated to other needs. 
 This "18 minutes" business, I find quite fascinating.,Because in Judaism, the number 18, in Hebrew letters,,stands for life -- the word "life.",So, in a sense, the 18 minutes is challenging me to say,,"In life, this is what's important in terms of compassion.",But, something else as well:,actually, 18 minutes is important.,Because at Passover, when we have to eat unleavened bread,,the rabbis say, what is the difference between dough that is made into bread,,and dough that is made into unleavened bread, or "matzah"?,And they say "It's 18 minutes.",Because that's how long they say it takes for this dough to become leaven.,What does it mean, "dough becomes leaven"?,It means it gets filled with hot air.,What's matzah? What's unleavened bread? You don't get it. 
 Symbolically, what the rabbis say is that at Passover,,what we have to do is try to get rid of our hot air -- our pride,,our feeling that we are the most important people in the whole entire world,,and that everything should revolve round us.,So we try and get rid of those,,and so doing, try to get rid of the habits, the emotions, the ideas,that enslave us, that make our eyes closed, give us tunnel vision,so we don't see the needs of others --,and free ourselves and free ourselves from that.,And that too is a basis for having compassion,,for understanding our place in the world. 
 Now there is, in Judaism, a gorgeous story,of a rich man who sat in synagogue one day.,And, as many people do, he was dozing off during the sermon.,And as he was dozing off, they were reading from the book of Leviticus in the Torah.,And they were saying that in the ancient times in the temple in Jerusalem,,the priests used to have bread,,which they used to place into a special table in the temple in Jerusalem.,The man was asleep, but he heard the words bread, temple, God, and he woke up.,He said, "God wants bread. That's it. God wants bread. I know what God wants." 
 And he rushed home. And after the Sabbath, he made 12 loaves of bread,,took them to the synagogue, went into the synagogue,,opened the ark and said, "God, I don't know why you want this bread, but here you are.",And he put it in the ark with the scrolls of the Torah.,Then he went home. 
 The cleaner came into the synagogue.,"Oh God, I'm in such trouble. I've got children to feed.,My wife's ill. I've got no money. What can I do?",He goes into the synagogue. "God, will you please help me?,Ah, what a wonderful smell.",He goes to the ark. He opens the ark.,"There's bread! God, you've answered my plea. You've answered my question.",Takes the bread and goes home. 
 Meanwhile, the rich man thinks to himself,,"I'm an idiot. God wants bread?,God, the one who rules the entire universe, wants my bread?",He rushes to the synagogue. "I'll get it out of the ark before anybody finds it.",He goes in there, and it's not there.,And he says, "God, you really did want it. You wanted my bread.,Next week, with raisins." 
 This went on for years.,Every week, the man would bring bread with raisins,,with all sorts of good things, put it into the ark.,Every week, the cleaner would come. "God you've answered my plea again.",Take the bread. Take it home. 
 Went on until a new rabbi came. Rabbis always spoil things.,The rabbi came in and saw what was going on.,And he called the two of them to his office.,And he said, you know, "This is what's happening." 
 And the rich man -- oh, dear -- crestfallen.,"You mean God didn't want my bread?" 
 And the poor man said, "And you mean God didn't answer my pleas?" 
 And the rabbi said, "You've misunderstood me.,You've misunderstood totally," he said.,"Of course, what you are doing," he said to the rich man,,"is answering God's plea that we should be compassionate.,And God," he said to the poor man, "is answering your plea,that people should be compassionate and give.",He looked at the rich man. He held the rich man's hands and said,,"Don't you understand?" He said, "These are the hands of God." 
 So that is the way I feel:,that I can only try to approach this notion of being compassionate,,of understanding that there is a connectivity, that there is a unity in this world;,that I want to try and serve that unity,,and that I can try and do that by understanding, I hope,,trying to understand something of the pain of others;,but understanding that there are limits, that people have to bear responsibility,for some of the problems that come upon them;,and that I have to understand that there are limits to my energy,,to the giving I can give.,I have to reevaluate them,,try and separate out the material things,and my emotions that may be enslaving me,,so that I can see the world clearly. 
 And then I have to try to see in what ways,I can make these the hands of God.,And so try to bring compassion to life in this world.Compassion:,what does it look like?,Come with me to 915 South Bloodworth Street,in Raleigh, North Carolina, where I grew up.,If you come in you will see us: evening time,,at table -- set for ten but not always all seats filled --,at the point when dinner is ready to be served.,Since mom had eight kids,,sometimes she said she couldn't tell who was who and where they were.,Before we could eat, she would ask,,"Are all the children in?",And if someone happened to be missing,,we would have to, we say, "Fix a plate" for that person, put it in the oven,,then we could say grace, and we could eat. 
 Also, while we were at the table,,there was a ritual in our family:,when something significant had happened for any one of us --,whether mom had just been elected as the president of the PTA,,or whether dad had gotten an assignment at the college of our denomination,,or whether someone had won the jabberwocky contest for talent --,the ritual at the family was, once the announcement is made,,we must take five, ten minutes to do what we call "make over" that person --,that is, to make a fuss over the one who had been honored in some way.,For when one is honored, all are honored. 
 Also, we had to make a report on our extended "visited" members,,that is, extended members of the family,,sick and elderly, shut in.,My task was, at least once a week, to visit Mother Lassiter,who lived on East Street,,Mother Williamson who lived on Bledsoe Avenue,,and Mother Lathers who lived on Oberlin Road.,Why? Because they were old and infirm,,and we needed to go by to see if they needed anything.,For mom said, "To be family, is to care and share and to look out for one another.,They are our family." 
 And, of course, sometimes there was a bonus for going.,They would offer sweets or money.,Mom says, "If they ask you what it costs to either go shopping for them,,you must always say, 'Nothing.',And if they insist, say, 'Whatever you mind to give me.'",This was the nature of being at that table.,In fact, she indicated that if we would do that,,not only would we have the joy of receiving the gratitude,from the members of the extended family,,but she said, "Even God will smile, and when God smiles,,there is peace, and justice, and joy." 
 So, at the table at 915, I learned something about compassion.,Of course, it was a minister's family,,so we had to add God into it.,And so, I came to think that mama eternal, mama eternal,,is always wondering: Are all the children in?,And if we had been faithful in caring and sharing,,we had the sense that justice and peace would have a chance in the world. 
 Now, it was not always wonderful at that table.,Let me explain a point at which we did not rise to the occasion.,It was Christmas, and at our family, oh, what a morning.,Christmas morning, where we open up our gifts,,where we have special prayers, and where we get to the old upright piano,and we would sing carols. It was a very intimate moment.,In fact, you could come down to the tree to get your gifts and get ready to sing,,and then get ready for breakfast without even taking a bath or getting dressed,,except that daddy messed it up. 
 There was a member of his staff who did not have any place,on that particular Christmas to celebrate.,And daddy brought Elder Revels to the Christmas family celebration.,We thought he must be out of his mind.,This is our time. This is intimate time.,This is when we can just be who we are,,and now we have this stuffy brother,with his shirt and tie on, while we are still in our PJs.,Why would daddy bring Elder Revels?,Any other time, but not to the Christmas celebration. 
 And mom overheard us and said,,"Well, you know what? If you really understand the nature of this celebration,,it is that this is a time where you extend the circle of love.,That's what the celebration is all about.,It's time to make space, to share the enjoyment of life in a beloved community.",So, we sucked up.,(Laughter) 
 But growing up at 915, compassion was not a word to be debated;,it was a sensibility to how we are together.,We are sisters and brothers united together.,And, like Chief Seattle said, "We did not spin the web of life.,We're all strands in it.,And whatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves.",Now that's compassion. 
 So, let me tell you, I kind of look at the world this way.,I see pictures, and something says, "Now, that's compassion.",A harvested field of grain, with some grain in the corners,,reminding me of the Hebrew tradition,that you may indeed harvest,,but you must always leave some on the edges,,just in case there's someone who has not,had the share necessary for good nurture.,Talk about a picture of compassion. 
 I see -- always, it stirs my heart --,a picture of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,walking arm in arm with Andy Young and Rabbi Heschel,and maybe Thich Nhat Hanh and some of the other saints assembled,,walking across the bridge and going into Selma.,Just a photograph.,Arm in arm for struggle.,Suffering together in a common hope that we can be brothers and sisters,without the accidents of our birth or our ethnicity,robbing us of a sense of unity of being. 
 So, there's another picture. Here, this one. I really do like this picture.,When Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated,,that day, everybody in my community was upset.,You heard about riots all across the land.,Bobby Kennedy was scheduled to bring an inner city message in Indianapolis.,This is the picture. They said,,"It's going to be too volatile for you to go.",He insisted, "I must go." 
 So, sitting on a flatbed truck,,the elders of the community are there,,and Bobby stands up and says to the people,,"I have bad news for you.,Some of you may not have heard that Dr. King has been assassinated.,I know that you are angry,,and I know that you would almost wish to have the opportunity,to enter now into activities of revenge. But,",he said, "what I really want you to know is that I know how you feel.,Because I had someone dear to me snatched away.,I know how you feel.",And he said, "I hope that you will have the strength to do what I did.,I allowed my anger, my bitterness, my grief to simmer a while,,and then I made up my mind that I was going to make a different world,,and we can do that together.",That's a picture. Compassion? I think I see it. 
 I saw it when the Dalai Lama came to the Riverside Church while I was a pastor,,and he invited representatives of faith traditions from all around the world.,He asked them to give a message,,and they each read in their own language a central affirmation,,and that was some version of the golden rule:,"As you would that others would do unto you,,do also unto them.",Twelve in their ecclesiastical or cultural or tribal attire,affirming one message.,We are so connected that we must treat each other,as if an action toward you is an action toward myself. 
 One more picture while I'm stinking and thinking about the Riverside Church:,9/11. Last night at Chagrin Fall,,a newspaperman and a television guy said,,"That evening, when a service was held at the Riverside Church,,we carried it on our station in this city.,It was," he said, "one of the most powerful moments of life together.,We were all suffering.,But you invited representatives of all of the traditions to come,,and you invited them.,'Find out what it is in your tradition,that tells us what to do when we have been humiliated,,when we have been despised and rejected.',And they all spoke out of their own traditions,,a word about the healing power of solidarity, one with the other." 
 I developed a sense of compassion sort of as second nature,,but I became a preacher.,Now, as a preacher, I got a job. I got to preach the stuff,,but I got to do it too.,Or, as Father Divine in Harlem used to say to folks,,"Some people preach the Gospel.,I have to tangibilitate the Gospel.",So, the real issue is: How do you tangibilitate compassion?,How do you make it real? 
 My faith has constantly lifted up the ideal,,and challenged me when I fell beneath it.,In my tradition, there is a gift that we have made to other traditions --,to everybody around the world who knows the story of the "Good Samaritan.",Many people think of it primarily in terms of charity,,random acts of kindness.,But for those who really study that text a little more thoroughly,,you will discover that a question has been raised,that leads to this parable. 
 The question was: "What is the greatest commandment?",And, according to Jesus, the word comes forth,,"You must love yourself,,you must love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind and soul,,and your neighbor as yourself." 
 And then the person asked, "Well, what do you mean, 'neighbor?'" 
 And he answered it by telling the story of the man who fell among thieves,,and how religious authorities went the other way,,and how their supporters in the congregation went the other way;,but an unsuspecting, despised person came along,,saw the man in need,,provided oil and wine for his wounds,,put him on his own transportation,,and took him to the inn,and asked the innkeeper, "Take care of him.",And he said, "Here, this is the initial investment,,but if needs continue, make sure that you provide them.,And whatever else is needed, I will provide it and pay for it when I return." 
 This always seemed to me to be a deepening,of the sense of what it means to be a Good Samaritan.,A Good Samaritan is not simply one whose heart is touched,in an immediate act of care and charity,,but one who provides a system of sustained care -- I like that,,'a system of sustained care ' -- in the inn, take care.,I think maybe it's one time when the Bible talks about a healthcare system,and a commitment to do whatever is necessary --,that all God's children would have their needs cared for,,so that we could answer when mommy eternal asks, "In regards to health,,are all the children in?" And we could say yes. 
 Oh, what a joy it has been to be a person seeking to tangibilitate compassion.,I recall that my work as a pastor,has always involved caring for their spiritual needs;,being concerned for housing, for healthcare,,for the prisoners, for the infirm, for children --,even the foster care children for whom no one can even keep a record,where they started off, where they are going.,To be a pastor is to care for these individual needs. 
 But now, to be a Good Samaritan -- and I always say,,and to be a good American -- for me,,is not simply to congratulate myself for the individual acts of care.,Compassion takes on a corporate dynamic.,I believe that whatever we did around that table at Bloodworth Street,must be done around tables and rituals of faith,until we become that family, that family together,that understands the nature of our unity.,We are one people together. 
 So, let me explain to you what I mean when I think about compassion,,and why I think it is so important that right at this point in history.,We would decide to establish this charter of compassion.,The reason it's important is because this is a very special time in history.,It is the time that, biblically, we would speak of as,the day, or the year, of God's favor.,This is a season of grace.,Unusual things are beginning to happen.,Please pardon me, as a black man, for celebrating,that the election of Obama was an unusual sign,of the fact that it is a year of favor.,And yet, there is so much more that needs to be done.,We need to bring health and food and education,and respect for all God's citizens, all God's children,,remembering mama eternal. 
 Now, let me close my comments by telling you,that whenever I feel something very deeply,,it usually takes the form of verse.,And so I want to close with a little song.,I close with this song -- it's a children's song --,because we are all children at the table of mama eternal.,And if mama eternal has taught us correctly,,this song will make sense, not only to those of us who are a part of this gathering,,but to all who sign the charter for compassion.,And this is why we do it. 
 The song says, ♫ "I made heaven so happy today, ♫,♫ Receiving God's love and giving it away ♫,♫ When I looked up, heaven smiled at me ♫,♫ Now, I'm so happy. Can't you see? ♫,♫ I'm happy. Look at me. I'm happy. Can't you see? ♫,♫ Sharing makes me happy, makes heaven happy too ♫,♫ I'm happy. Look at me. I'm happy. Can't you see? ♫,♫ Let me share my happy loving smile with you. ♫ 
 That's compassion. (Applause)I want to open by quoting Einstein's wonderful statement,,just so people will feel at ease that the great scientist of the 20th century,also agrees with us, and also calls us to this action.,He said, "A human being is a part of the whole, called by us, the 'universe,' --,a part limited in time and space.,He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings,,as something separated from the rest,,a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness.,This delusion is a kind of prison for us,,restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us.,Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion,,to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty." 
 This insight of Einstein's is uncannily close to that of Buddhist psychology,,wherein compassion -- "karuna," it is called --,is defined as, "the sensitivity to another's suffering,and the corresponding will to free the other from that suffering.",It pairs closely with love, which is the will for the other to be happy,,which requires, of course, that one feels some happiness oneself,and wishes to share it.,This is perfect in that it clearly opposes self-centeredness,and selfishness to compassion, the concern for others,,and, further, it indicates that those caught in the cycle of self-concern,suffer helplessly, while the compassionate are more free,and, implicitly, more happy. 
 The Dalai Lama often states that compassion is his best friend.,It helps him when he is overwhelmed with grief and despair.,Compassion helps him turn away from the feeling of his suffering,as the most absolute, most terrible suffering anyone has ever had,and broadens his awareness of the sufferings of others,,even of the perpetrators of his misery and the whole mass of beings.,In fact, suffering is so huge and enormous,,his own becomes less and less monumental.,And he begins to move beyond his self-concern into the broader concern for others.,And this immediately cheers him up,,as his courage is stimulated to rise to the occasion.,Thus, he uses his own suffering,as a doorway to widening his circle of compassion.,He is a very good colleague of Einstein's, we must say. 
 Now, I want to tell a story,,which is a very famous story in the Indian and Buddhist tradition,,of the great Saint Asanga,who was a contemporary of Augustine in the West,and was sort of like the Buddhist Augustine.,And Asanga lived 800 years after the Buddha's time.,And he was discontented with the state of people's practice,of the Buddhist religion in India at that time. 
 And so he said, "I'm sick of all this. Nobody's really living the doctrine.,They're talking about love and compassion and wisdom and enlightenment,,but they are acting selfish and pathetic.,So, Buddha's teaching has lost its momentum.,I know the next Buddha will come a few thousand years from now,,but exists currently in a certain heaven" -- that's Maitreya --,"so, I'm going to go on a retreat and I'm going to meditate,and pray until the Buddha Maitreya reveals himself to me,,and gives me a teaching or something,to revive the practice of compassion in the world today." 
 So he went on this retreat. And he meditated for three years,and he did not see the future Buddha Maitreya.,And he left in disgust.,And as he was leaving, he saw a man --,a funny little man sitting sort of part way down the mountain.,And he had a lump of iron.,And he was rubbing it with a cloth.,And he became interested in that.,He said, "Well what are you doing?",And the man said, "I'm making a needle.",And he said, "That's ridiculous. You can't make a needle,by rubbing a lump of iron with a cloth.",And the man said, "Really?" And he showed him a dish full of needles.,So he said, "Okay, I get the point.",He went back to his cave. He meditated again. 
 Another three years, no vision. He leaves again.,This time, he comes down.,And as he's leaving, he sees a bird making a nest on a cliff ledge.,And where it's landing to bring the twigs to the cliff,,its feathers brushes the rock -- and it had cut the rock,six to eight inches in. There was a cleft in the rock,by the brushing of the feathers of generations of the birds.,So he said, "All right. I get the point." He went back. 
 Another three years.,Again, no vision of Maitreya after nine years.,And he again leaves, and this time: water dripping,,making a giant bowl in the rock where it drips in a stream.,And so, again, he goes back. And after 12 years there is still no vision.,And he's freaked out. And he won't even look left or right,to see any encouraging vision. 
 And he comes to the town. He's a broken person.,And there, in the town, he's approached by a dog,who comes like this -- one of these terrible dogs you can see in some poor countries,,even in America, I think, in some areas --,and he's looking just terrible.,And he becomes interested in this dog because it's so pathetic,,and it's trying to attract his attention. And he sits down looking at the dog.,And the dog's whole hindquarters are a complete open sore.,Some of it is like gangrenous,,and there are maggots in the flesh. And it's terrible.,He thinks, "What can I do to fix up this dog?,Well, at least I can clean this wound and wash it." 
 So, he takes it to some water. He's about to clean,,but then his awareness focuses on the maggots.,And he sees the maggots, and the maggots are kind of looking a little cute.,And they're maggoting happily in the dog's hindquarters there.,"Well, if I clean the dog, I'll kill the maggots. So how can that be?,That's it. I'm a useless person and there's no Buddha, no Maitreya,,and everything is all hopeless.,And now I'm going to kill the maggots?" 
 So, he had a brilliant idea.,And he took a shard of something, and cut a piece of flesh from his thigh,,and he placed it on ground.,He was not really thinking too carefully about the ASPCA.,He was just immediately caught with the situation.,So he thought, "I will take the maggots and put them on this piece of flesh,,then clean the dog's wounds, and then,I'll figure out what to do with the maggots." 
 So he starts to do that. He can't grab the maggots.,Apparently they wriggle around. They're kind of hard to grab, these maggots.,So he says, "Well, I'll put my tongue on the dog's flesh.,And then the maggots will jump on my warmer tongue" --,the dog is kind of used up --,"and then I'll spit them one by one down on the thing.",So he goes down, and he's sticking his tongue out like this.,And he had to close his eyes, it's so disgusting, and the smell and everything. 
 And then, suddenly, there's a pfft, a noise like that.,He jumps back and there, of course, is the future Buddha Maitreya,in a beautiful vision -- rainbow lights, golden, jeweled, a plasma body,,an exquisite mystic vision -- that he sees.,And he says, "Oh." He bows.,But, being human, he's immediately thinking of his next complaint. 
 So as he comes up from his first bow he says,,"My Lord, I'm so happy to see you, but where have you been for 12 years?,What is this?" 
 And Maitreya says, "I was with you. Who do you think was making needles,and making nests and dripping on rocks for you, mister dense?",(Laughter),"Looking for the Buddha in person," he said.,And he said, "You didn't have, until this moment, real compassion.,And, until you have real compassion, you cannot recognize love.","Maitreya" means love, "the loving one," in Sanskrit. 
 And so he looked very dubious, Asanga did.,And he said, "If you don't believe me, just take me with you.",And so he took the Maitreya -- it shrunk into a globe, a ball --,took him on his shoulder.,And he ran into town in the marketplace, and he said, "Rejoice! Rejoice!,The future Buddha has come ahead of all predictions. Here he is.",And then pretty soon they started throwing rocks and stones at him --,it wasn't Chautauqua, it was some other town --,because they saw a demented looking, scrawny looking yogi man,,like some kind of hippie, with a bleeding leg and a rotten dog on his shoulder,,shouting that the future Buddha had come. 
 So, naturally, they chased him out of town.,But on the edge of town, one elderly lady, a charwoman in the charnel ground,,saw a jeweled foot on a jeweled lotus on his shoulder and then the dog,,but she saw the jewel foot of the Maitreya, and she offered a flower.,So that encouraged him, and he went with Maitreya. 
 Maitreya then took him to a certain heaven,,which is the typical way a Buddhist myth unfolds.,And Maitreya then kept him in heaven for five years,,dictating to him five complicated tomes,of the methodology of how you cultivate compassion. 
 And then I thought I would share with you what that method is, or one of them.,A famous one, it's called the "Sevenfold Causal Method of Developing Compassion.",And it begins first by one meditating and visualizing that all beings are with one --,even animals too, but everyone is in human form.,The animals are in one of their human lives. The humans are human.,And then, among them, you think of your friends and loved ones, the circle at the table.,And you think of your enemies, and you think of the neutral ones.,And then you try to say, "Well, the loved ones I love.,But, you know, after all, they're nice to me.,I had fights with them. Sometimes they were unfriendly.,I got mad. Brothers can fight. Parents and children can fight.,So, in a way, I like them so much because they're nice to me.,While the neutral ones I don't know. They could all be just fine.,And then the enemies I don't like because they're mean to me.,But they are nice to somebody. I could be them." 
 And then the Buddhists, of course, think that, because we've all had infinite previous lives,,we've all been each other's relatives, actually.,Therefore all of you, in the Buddhist view,,in some previous life, although you don't remember it and neither do I,,have been my mother -- for which I do apologize for the trouble I caused you.,And also, actually, I've been your mother.,I've been female, and I've been every single one of yours' mother in a previous life,,the way the Buddhists reflect.,So, my mother in this life is really great. But all of you in a way,are part of the eternal mother.,You gave me that expression; "the eternal mama," you said. That's wonderful.,So, that's the way the Buddhists do it.,A theist Christian can think that all beings, even my enemies, are God's children.,So, in that sense, we're related. 
 So, they first create this foundation of equality.,So, we sort of reduce a little of the clinging to the ones we love --,just in the meditation -- and we open our mind to those we don't know.,And we definitely reduce the hostility and the "I don't want to be compassionate to them",to the ones we think of as the bad guys, the ones we hate and we don't like.,And we don't hate anyone, therefore. So we equalize. That's very important. 
 And then the next thing we do is what is called "mother recognition.",And that is, we think of every being as familiar, as family.,We expand. We take the feeling about remembering a mama,,and we defuse that to all beings in this meditation.,And we see the mother in every being.,We see that look that the mother has on her face,,looking at this child that is a miracle,that she has produced from her own body, being a mammal,,where she has true compassion, truly is the other, and identifies completely.,Often the life of that other will be more important to her than her own life.,And that's why it's the most powerful form of altruism.,The mother is the model of all altruism for human beings,,in spiritual traditions.,And so, we reflect until we can sort of see that motherly expression in all beings. 
 People laugh at me because, you know, I used to say that,I used to meditate on mama Cheney as my mom,,when, of course, I was annoyed with him about all of his evil doings in Iraq.,I used to meditate on George Bush. He's quite a cute mom in a female form.,He has his little ears and he smiles and he rocks you in his arms.,And you think of him as nursing you.,And then Saddam Hussein's serious mustache is a problem,,but you think of him as a mom. 
 And this is the way you do it. You take any being who looks weird to you,,and you see how they could be familiar to you.,And you do that for a while, until you really feel that.,You can feel the familiarity of all beings.,Nobody seems alien. They're not "other.",You reduce the feeling of otherness about beings.,Then you move from there to remembering the kindness of mothers in general,,if you can remember the kindness of your own mother,,if you can remember the kindness of your spouse,,or, if you are a mother yourself, how you were with your children.,And you begin to get very sentimental; you cultivate sentimentality intensely.,You will even weep, perhaps, with gratitude and kindness.,And then you connect that with your feeling that everyone has that motherly possibility.,Every being, even the most mean looking ones, can be motherly. 
 And then, third, you step from there to what is called "a feeling of gratitude.",You want to repay that kindness that all beings have shown to you.,And then the fourth step, you go to what is called "lovely love.",In each one of these you can take some weeks, or months, or days,depending on how you do it, or you can do them in a run, this meditation.,And then you think of how lovely beings are when they are happy,,when they are satisfied.,And every being looks beautiful when they are internally feeling a happiness.,Their face doesn't look like this. When they're angry, they look ugly, every being,,but when they're happy they look beautiful.,And so you see beings in their potential happiness.,And you feel a love toward them and you want them to be happy, even the enemy. 
 We think Jesus is being unrealistic,when he says, "Love thine enemy.",He does say that, and we think he's being unrealistic,and sort of spiritual and highfalutin. "Nice for him to say it, but I can't do that.",But, actually, that's practical.,If you love your enemy that means you want your enemy to be happy.,If your enemy was really happy, why would they bother to be your enemy?,How boring to run around chasing you.,They would be relaxing somewhere having a good time.,So it makes sense to want your enemy to be happy,,because they'll stop being your enemy because that's too much trouble. 
 But anyway, that's the "lovely love. ",And then finally, the fifth step is compassion, "universal compassion.",And that is where you then look at the reality of all the beings you can think of.,And you look at them, and you see how they are.,And you realize how unhappy they are actually, mostly, most of the time.,You see that furrowed brow in people.,And then you realize they don't even have compassion on themselves.,They're driven by this duty and this obligation.,"I have to get that. I need more. I'm not worthy. And I should do something.",And they're rushing around all stressed out.,And they think of it as somehow macho, hard discipline on themselves.,But actually they are cruel to themselves.,And, of course, they are cruel and ruthless toward others.,And they, then, never get any positive feedback.,And the more they succeed and the more power they have,,the more unhappy they are.,And this is where you feel real compassion for them. 
 And you then feel you must act.,And the choice of the action, of course,,hopefully will be more practical,than poor Asanga, who was fixing the maggots on the dog,because he had that motivation, and whoever was in front of him,,he wanted to help.,But, of course, that is impractical. He should have founded the ASPCA in the town,and gotten some scientific help for dogs and maggots.,And I'm sure he did that later. (Laughter) But that just indicates the state of mind, you know. 
 And so the next step -- the sixth step beyond "universal compassion" --,is this thing where you're linked with the needs of others in a true way,,and you have compassion for yourself also,,and it isn't sentimental only. You might be in fear of something.,Some bad guy is making himself more and more unhappy,being more and more mean to other people,and getting punished in the future for it in various ways.,And in Buddhism, they catch it in the future life.,Of course in theistic religion they're punished by God or whatever.,And materialism, they think they get out of it just by not existing,,by dying, but they don't.,And so they get reborn as whatever, you know. 
 Never mind. I won't get into that.,But the next step is called "universal responsibility.",And that is very important -- the Charter of Compassion,must lead us to develop through true compassion,,what is called "universal responsibility.",In the great teaching of his Holiness the Dalai Lama,that he always teaches everywhere, he says,that that is the common religion of humanity: kindness.,But "kindness" means "universal responsibility.",And that means whatever happens to other beings is happening to us:,we are responsible for that, and we should take it,and do whatever we can at whatever little level,and small level that we can do it.,We absolutely must do that. There is no way not to do it. 
 And then, finally, that leads to a new orientation in life,where we live equally for ourselves and for others,and we are,joyful and happy.,One thing we mustn't think is that compassion makes you miserable.,Compassion makes you happy.,The first person who is happy when you get great compassion is yourself,,even if you haven't done anything yet for anybody else.,Although, the change in your mind already does something for other beings:,they can sense this new quality in yourself,,and it helps them already, and gives them an example. 
 And that uncompassionate clock has just showed me that it's all over. 
 So, practice compassion, read the charter, disseminate it,and develop it within yourself.,Don't just think, "Well, I'm compassionate," or "I'm not compassionate,",and sort of think you're stuck there.,You can develop this. You can diminish the non-compassion,,the cruelty, the callousness, the neglect of others,,and take universal responsibility for them.,And then, not only will God smile and the eternal mama will smile,,but Karen Armstrong will smile. 
 Thank you very much. (Applause)A human child is born,,and for quite a long time,is a consumer.,It cannot be consciously a contributor.,It is helpless.,It doesn't know how to survive,,even though it is endowed with an instinct to survive.,It needs the help of mother, or a foster mother, to survive.,It can't afford to doubt the person who tends the child.,It has to totally surrender,,as one surrenders to an anesthesiologist. 
 It has to totally surrender.,That implies a lot of trust.,That implies the trusted person,won't violate the trust.,As the child grows,,it begins to discover,that the person trusted is violating the trust.,It doesn't know even the word "violation.",Therefore, it has to blame itself,,a wordless blame,,which is more difficult to really resolve --,the wordless self-blame. 
 As the child grows to become an adult:,so far, it has been a consumer,,but the growth of a human being,lies in his or her capacity to contribute,,to be a contributor.,One cannot contribute unless one feels secure,,one feels big,,one feels: I have enough. 
 To be compassionate is not a joke.,It's not that simple.,One has to discover a certain bigness in oneself.,That bigness should be centered on oneself,,not in terms of money,,not in terms of power you wield,,not in terms of any status that you can command in the society,,but it should be centered on oneself.,The self: you are self-aware.,On that self, it should be centered -- a bigness, a wholeness.,Otherwise, compassion is just a word and a dream. 
 You can be compassionate occasionally,,more moved by empathy,than by compassion.,Thank God we are empathetic.,When somebody's in pain, we pick up the pain. 
 In a Wimbledon final match,,these two guys fight it out.,Each one has got two games.,It can be anybody's game.,What they have sweated so far has no meaning.,One person wins.,The tennis etiquette is, both the players have to come to the net,and shake hands.,The winner boxes the air,and kisses the ground,,throws his shirt as though somebody is waiting for it.,(Laughter),And this guy has to come to the net.,When he comes to the net,,you see, his whole face changes.,It looks as though he's wishing that he didn't win.,Why? Empathy. 
 That's human heart.,No human heart is denied of that empathy.,No religion can demolish that by indoctrination.,No culture, no nation and nationalism --,nothing can touch it,because it is empathy.,And that capacity to empathize,is the window through which you reach out to people,,you do something that makes a difference in somebody's life --,even words, even time. 
 Compassion is not defined in one form.,There's no Indian compassion.,There's no American compassion.,It transcends nation, the gender, the age.,Why? Because it is there in everybody.,It's experienced by people occasionally. 
 Then this occasional compassion,,we are not talking about --,it will never remain occasional.,By mandate, you cannot make a person compassionate.,You can't say, "Please love me.",Love is something you discover.,It's not an action,,but in the English language, it is also an action.,I will come to it later. 
 So one has got to discover a certain wholeness.,I am going to cite the possibility of being whole,,which is within our experience, everybody's experience.,In spite of a very tragic life,,one is happy in moments which are very few and far between.,And the one who is happy,,even for a slapstick joke,,accepts himself and also the scheme of things in which one finds oneself. 
 That means the whole universe,,known things and unknown things.,All of them are totally accepted,because you discover your wholeness in yourself.,The subject -- "me" --,and the object -- the scheme of things --,fuse into oneness,,an experience nobody can say, "I am denied of,",an experience common to all and sundry. 
 That experience confirms that, in spite of all your limitations --,all your wants, desires, unfulfilled, and the credit cards,and layoffs,and, finally, baldness --,you can be happy.,But the extension of the logic is,that you don't need to fulfill your desire to be happy.,You are the very happiness, the wholeness that you want to be. 
 There's no choice in this:,that only confirms the reality,that the wholeness cannot be different from you,,cannot be minus you.,It has got to be you.,You cannot be a part of wholeness,and still be whole.,Your moment of happiness reveals that reality,,that realization, that recognition:,"Maybe I am the whole.,Maybe the swami is right. 
 Maybe the swami is right." You start your new life.,Then everything becomes meaningful.,I have no more reason to blame myself.,If one has to blame oneself, one has a million reasons plus many.,But if I say, in spite of my body being limited --,if it is black it is not white, if it is white it is not black:,body is limited any which way you look at it. Limited. 
 Your knowledge is limited, health is limited,,and power is therefore limited,,and the cheerfulness is going to be limited.,Compassion is going to be limited.,Everything is going to be limitless.,You cannot command compassion,unless you become limitless, and nobody can become limitless,,either you are or you are not. Period.,And there is no way of your being not limitless too. 
 Your own experience reveals, in spite of all limitations, you are the whole.,And the wholeness is the reality of you,when you relate to the world.,It is love first.,When you relate to the world,,the dynamic manifestation of the wholeness,is, what we say, love.,And itself becomes compassion,if the object that you relate to evokes that emotion.,Then that again transforms into giving, into sharing.,You express yourself because you have compassion. 
 To discover compassion, you need to be compassionate.,To discover the capacity to give and share,,you need to be giving and sharing.,There is no shortcut: it is like swimming by swimming.,You learn swimming by swimming.,You cannot learn swimming on a foam mattress and enter into water.,(Laughter),You learn swimming by swimming. You learn cycling by cycling.,You learn cooking by cooking,,having some sympathetic people around you,to eat what you cook.,(Laughter) 
 And, therefore, what I say,,you have to fake it and make it.,(Laughter),You need to.,My predecessor meant that.,You have to act it out.,You have to act compassionately. 
 There is no verb for compassion,,but you have an adverb for compassion.,That's interesting to me.,You act compassionately.,But then, how to act compassionately if you don't have compassion?,That is where you fake.,You fake it and make it. This is the mantra of the United States of America.,(Laughter) 
 You fake it and make it.,You act compassionately as though you have compassion:,grind your teeth,,take all the support system.,If you know how to pray, pray.,Ask for compassion.,Let me act compassionately.,Do it.,You'll discover compassion,and also slowly a relative compassion,,and slowly, perhaps if you get the right teaching,,you'll discover compassion is a dynamic manifestation,of the reality of yourself, which is oneness, wholeness,,and that's what you are. 
 With these words, thank you very much.,(Applause)I was informed by this kind of,unoriginal and trite idea,that new technologies were an opportunity,for social transformation,,which is what drove me then,,and still, it's a delusion that drives me now.,I wanted to update what I've been doing since then --,but it's still the same theme song --,and introduce you to my lab and current work,,which is the Environmental Health Clinic,that I run at NYU.,And what it is -- it's a twist on health.,Because, really, what I'm trying to do now,is redefine what counts as health.,It's a clinic like a health clinic at any other university,,except people come to the clinic,with environmental health concerns,,and they walk out with prescriptions,for things they can do to improve environmental health,,as opposed to coming to a clinic with medical concerns,and walking out with prescriptions for pharmaceuticals. 
 It's a handy-dandy quote from Hippocrates of the Hippocratic oath,that says, "The greater part of the soul lays outside the body,,treatment of the inner requires treatment of the outer.",But that suggests the issue,that I'm trying to get at here,,that we have an opportunity to redefine what is health.,Because this idea that health is internal,and atomized and individual,and pharmaceutical,is largely an error.,And I would use this study,,a recent study by Philip Landrigan,,to motivate a different view of health,,where he went to most of the pediatricians in Manhattan,and the New York area,and logged what they spent their patient hours on.,80 to 90 percent of their time,was spent on five things.,Number one was asthma,,number two was developmental delays,,number three was 400-fold increases,in rare childhood cancers,in the last eight to 10, 15 years.,Number four and five were childhood obesity,and diabetes-related issues.,So all of those -- what's common about all of those?,The environment is implicated, radically implicated, right.,This is not the germs,that medicos were trained to deal with;,this is a different definition of health,,health that has a great advantage,because it's external, it's shared,,we can do something about it,,as opposed to internal, genetically predetermined,or individualized. 
 People who come to the clinic are called, not patients,,but impatients,,because they're too impatient to wait for legislative change,to address local and environmental health issues.,And I meet them at the University, I also have a few field offices,that I set up in various places,that provide an immersion,in some of the environmental challenges we face.,I like this one from the Belgian field office,,where we met in a roundabout,,precisely because the roundabout iconified,the headless social movement,that informs much social transformation,,as opposed to the top-down control,of red light traffic intersections.,In this case, of course, the roundabout,with that micro-decisions being made in situ,by people not being told what to do.,But, of course, affords greater throughput,,fewer accidents,,and an interesting model of social movement. 
 Some of the things that the monitoring protocols have developed:,this is the tadpole bureaucrat protocol,,or keeping tabs, if you will.,What they are is an addition of tadpoles,that are named after a local bureaucrat,whose decisions affect your water quality.,So an impatient concerned for water quality,would raise a tadpole bureaucrat,in a sample of water in which they're interested.,And we give them a couple of things to do that,,to help them do companion animal devices,while they're blogging and doing their email.,This is a tadpole walker,to take your tadpole walking in the evening.,And the interesting thing that happens --,because we're using tadpoles, of course,,because they have the most exquisite biosenses that we have,,several orders of magnitude more sensitive,than some of our senses,for sensing,,responding in a biologically meaningful way,,to that whole class of industrial contaminants,we call endocrine disruptors,or hormone emulators. 
 But by taking your tadpole out for a walk in the evening --,there's a few action shots --,your neighbors are likely to say, "What are you doing?",And then you have to introduce your tadpole,and who it's named after.,You have to explain what you're doing,and how the developmental events of a tadpole,are, of course, very observable,and they use the same T3-mediated hormones that we do.,And so next time your neighbor sees you,they'll say, "How is that tadpole doing?",And you can let them social network with your tadpole,,because the Environmental Health Clinic has a social networking site,for, not only impatients, humans,,but non-humans,,social networking for humans and non-humans.,And of course, these endocrine disruptors,are things that are implicated in the breast cancer epidemic,,the obesity epidemic,,the two and a half year drop in the average age of onset of puberty in young girls,and other related things.,The culmination of this is if you've successfully raised your tadpole,,observing the behavioral,and developmental events,,you will then go and introduce your tadpole,to its namesake,and discuss the evidence that you've seen. 
 Another quick protocol -- and I'm going to go through these quickly,,but just to give you the material sense of what we're doing here --,instead of asking you for urine samples,,I'll ask you for a mouse sample.,Anyone here lucky enough to share, to cohabit with a mouse --,a domestic partnership with mice?,Very lucky.,Mice, of course, are the quintessential,model organism.,They're even better models of environmental health,,because not only the same mammalian biology,,but they share your diet, largely.,They share your environmental stressors,,the asbestos levels and lead levels,,whatever you're exposed to.,And they're geographically more limited than you are,,because we don't know if you've been exposed,to persistent organic pollutants,in your home, or occupationally,or as a child.,Mice are a very good representation.,So it starts by building a better mousetrap, of course.,This is one of them. 
 Coping with environmental stressors is tricky.,Is anybody here on antidepressants?,(Laughter),There's a lot of people in Manhattan are.,And we were testing if the mice,would also self-administer SSRIs.,So this was Prozac, this was Zoloft,,this was a black jellybean and this was muscle relaxant,,all of which were the medications that the impatient was taking.,So do you think the mice,self-administered antidepressants?,What's the -- (Audience: Sure. Yes.),How did you know that? They did.,This was vodka and solution, gin and solution.,This guy also liked plain water and the muscle relaxant.,Where's our expert?,Vodka, gin --,(Audience: [unclear]),Yes. Yes. You know your mice well.,They did, yes.,So they drank as much vodka as they did plain water,,which was interesting.,Then of course, it goes into the entrapment device.,There's an old cellphone in there -- a good use for old cellphones --,which dials the clinic, we go and pick up the mouse.,We take the blood sample,and do the blood work and hair work on the mice. 
 And I want to sort of point out the big advantage,of framing health in this external way.,But we do have a few prescription products through this.,It's very different from the medical model.,Anything you do to improve your water quality or air quality,,or to understand it or to change it,,the benefits are enjoyed by anyone,you share that water quality or air quality with.,And that aggregating effect,,that collective action effect,,is actually something we can use to our advantage.,So I want to show you one prescription product in the clinic,called the No Park.,This is a prescription to improve water quality.,Many impatients are very concerned for water quality and air quality.,What we do is we take a fire hydrant,,a "no parking" space associated with a fire hydrant,,and we prescribe the removal of the asphalt,to create an engineered micro landscape,,to create an infiltration opportunity. 
 Because, many of you will know,,that the biggest pollution burden,that we have on the New York, New Jersey harbor right now,is no longer the point sources,,no longer the big polluters,,no longer the GEs,,but that massive network of roads,,[those] impervious surfaces,,that collect all that cadmium neurotoxin that comes from your brake liners,or the oily hydrocarbon waste,in every single storm event and medieval infrastructure,washes it straight into the estuary system.,That doesn't do a lot of good.,These are little opportunities to intercept those pollutants,before they enter the harbor,,and they're produced by impatients,on various city blocks,in some very interesting ways.,I just want to say it was sort of a rule of thumb though,,there's about two or three fire hydrants,on every city block.,By creating engineered micro landscapes to infiltrate in them,,we don't prevent them from being used,as emergency vehicle parking spaces,,because, of course, a firetruck can come and park there.,They flatten a few plants. No big deal, they'll regenerate.,But if we did this,in every single --,every fire hydrant,we could redefine the emergency.,That 99 percent of the time,when a firetruck is not parking there,,it's infiltrating pollutants.,It's also increasing fixing CO2s,,sequestering some of the airborne pollutants.,And aggregated,,these smaller interceptions,could actually infiltrate all the roadborne pollution,that now runs into the estuary system,,up to a seven inch rain event, up to a hundred-year storm. 
 So these are small actions,that can amount to a significant effect,to improve local environmental health.,This is one of the more ambitious ones.,What the climate crisis has revealed to us,is a secondary, more insidious,and more pervasive crisis,,which is the crisis of agency,,which is what to do.,Somehow buying a local lettuce, changing a light bulb,,driving the speed limit, changing your tires regularly,,doesn't seem sufficient,in the face of climate crisis.,And this is an interesting icon that happened --,you remember these: fallout shelters.,What is the fallout shelter,for the climate crisis?,This was civic mobilization.,Churches, school groups,,hospitals, private residents --,everyone built one of these in a matter of months.,And they still remain,as icons of civic response,in the face of shared, uncertain, collective threat. 
 Fallout shelter for the climate crisis,,I would say, looks something like this, or this,,which is an intensive urban agriculture facility,that's due to go on my lab building at NYU.,What it does,is a very simple idea,of taking --,80 to 90 percent of the CO2 produced in Manhattan,is building related --,we take, just like a commercial greenhouse,,we take the CO2 from the building --,CO2-enriched air --,we force it through the urban agriculture facility,,and then we resupply oxygen-enriched air.,You can't actually build much on a roof, they're not designed for that.,So it's on legs,,so it focuses all the load on the masonry walls and the columns.,It's built as a barn raising,,using open source hardware.,This is the quarter-scale prototype,that was functioning in Spain.,This is what it will look like, fingers crossed,,NYU willing. 
 And what I want to show you is --,actually this is one of the components of it that we've just recently been testing --,which is a solar chimney --,we have got 17 of them now put around New York at the moment --,that passively draws air up.,You understand a solar chimney.,Hot air rises.,You put a bit of black plastic on the side of a building,,it'll heat up, and you'll get passive airflow.,What we do is actually,put a standard HVAC filter on the top of that.,That actually removes about 95 percent,of the carbon black,,that stuff that, with ozone,,is responsible for about half of global warming's effects,,because it changes, it settles on the snow,,it changes the reflectors,,it changes,the transmission qualities of the atmosphere.,Carbon black is that grime,that otherwise lodges in your pretty pink lungs,,and it's associated with.,It's not good stuff, and it's from inefficient combustion,,not from combustion itself.,When we put it through our solar chimney,,we remove actually about 95 percent of that.,And then I swap it out,with the students,and actually re-release that carbon black.,And we make pencils the length of which measures the grime,that we've pulled out of the air.,Here's one of them that we have up now.,Here's who put them up and who are avid pencil users. 
 Okay, so I want to show you,just two more interfaces,,because I think one of our big challenges,is re-imagining our relationship to natural systems,,not only through this model,of twisted personalized health,,but through the animals,with whom we cohabit.,We are not alone; the animals are moving in.,In fact, urban migration now describes,the movement of animals formerly known as wild,into urban centers.,You know, coyote in Central Park, a whale in the Gowanus Canal,,elk in Westchester County.,It's happening all over the Developed World,,probably for loss of habitat,,but also because our cities are a little bit more livable,than they have been.,And every green space we create,is an invitation for non-humans to cohabit with us.,But we've kind of lacked imagination,in how we could do that well or interestingly.,And I want to show you a few of the technological interfaces,that have been developed under the moniker of OOZ --,which is zoo backwards and without cages --,to try and reform,that relationship.,This is communication technology for birds. It looks like this.,When a bird lands on it, they trigger a sound file.,This is actually in the Whitney Museum, where there were six of them,,each of which had a different argument on it,,different sound file.,They said things like this. 
 (Whistling) 
 Recorded Voice: Here's what you need to do.,Go down there and buy some of those health food bars,,the ones you call bird food,,and bring it here and scatter it around.,There's a good person. 
 Natalie Jeremijenko: Okay. (Laugher),So there was several of these.,The birds were able to jump from one to the other.,These are just your average urban pigeon.,And an early test,which argument elicited cooperative behavior,from the people below --,about a hundred to one,decided that this was the argument,that worked best on us. 
 Recorded Voice: Tick, tick, tick.,That's the sound of genetic mutations,of the avian flu,becoming a deadly human flu.,Do you know what slows it down?,Healthy sub-populations of birds,,increasing biodiversity generally.,It is in your interests that I'm healthy,,happy, well-fed.,Hence, you could share some of your nutritional resources,instead of monopolizing them.,That is, share your lunch. 
 (Laughter) 
 NJ: It worked, and it's true.,The final project I'd like to show you,is a new interface for fish,that has just been launched --,it's actually officially launched next week --,with a wonderful commission from the Architectural League.,You may not have known that you need to communicate with fish,,but there is now a device for you to do so.,It looks like this: buoys that float on the water,,project three foot up, three foot down.,When a fish swims underneath, a light goes on.,This is what it looks like.,So there's another function on here.,This top light is -- I'm sorry if I'm making you seasick --,this top light is actually a water quality display,that shifts from red, when the dissolved oxygen is low,,to a blue/green, when its dissolved oxygen is high.,And then you can also text the fish.,So there's business cards down there,that'll give you contact details.,And they text back.,When the buoys get your text, they wink at you twice to say, we've got your message.,But perhaps the most popular has been,that we've got another array of these boys in the Bronx River,,where the first beaver --,crazy as he is --,to have moved in and built a lodge in New York,in 250 years, hangs out.,So updates from a beaver.,You can subscribe to updates from him. You can talk to him. 
 And what I like to think of,is this is an interface,that re-scripts how we interact with natural systems,,specifically by changing who has information,,where they have it,,who can make sense of that information,,and what you can do about it.,In this case, instead of throwing chewing gum,,or Doritos or whatever you have in your pocket at the fish --,There's a body of water in Iceland that I've been dealing with,that's in the middle of the city,,and the largest pollution burden on it,is not the roadborne pollution,,it's actually white bread,from people feeding the fish and the birds.,Instead of doing that actually, we've developed some fish sticks,that you can feed the fish.,They're delicious.,They're cross-species delicious that is,,delicious for humans and non-humans.,But they also have a chelating agent in them.,They're nutritionally appropriate,,not like Doritos.,And so every time,that desire to interact with the animals,,which is at least as ubiquitous,as that sign: "Do not feed the animals.",And there's about three of them on every New York City park.,And Yellowstone National Park,,there's more "do not feed the animals" signs,than there are animals you might wish to feed.,But in that action, that interaction,,by re-scripting that,,by changing it into an opportunity,to offer food that is nutritionally appropriate,,that could augment the nutritional resources,that we ourselves have depleted,for augmenting the fish population,and also adding chelating agent,,which, like any chelating agent that we use medicinally,,binds to the bioaccumulated heavy metals and PCBs,that are in the fish,living in this particular habitat,and allows them to pass it out as a harmless salt,where it's complexed by a reactive,,effectively removing it from bioavailability. 
 But I wanted to say that interaction,,re-scripting that interaction,,into collective action, collective remediative action,,very different from the approach,that's being used on the other side on the Hudson River,,where we're dredging the PCBs --,after 30 years of legislative and legal struggle,,GE's paying for the dredging,of the largest Superfund site in the world --,we're dredging it, and it'll probably get shipped off to Pennsylvania,or the nearest Third World country,,where it will continue to be toxic sludge.,Displacement is not the way to deal with environmental issues.,And that's typically the paradigm,under which we've operated. 
 By actually taking the opportunity,that new technologies,,new interactive technologies, present,to re-script our interactions,,to script them,,not just as isolated, individuated interactions,,but as collective aggregating actions,that can amount to something,,we can really begin to address,some of our important environmental challenges. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'd like to share with you a discovery that I made a few months ago,while writing an article for Italian Wired.,I always keep my thesaurus handy whenever I'm writing anything,,but I'd already finished editing the piece,,and I realized that I had never once in my life,looked up the word "disabled" to see what I'd find. 
 Let me read you the entry.,"Disabled, adjective: crippled, helpless, useless, wrecked,,stalled, maimed, wounded, mangled, lame, mutilated,,run-down, worn-out, weakened, impotent, castrated, paralyzed, handicapped,,senile, decrepit, laid-up, done-up, done-for, done-in,cracked-up, counted-out;,see also hurt, useless and weak.,Antonyms, healthy, strong, capable.",I was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing,,it was so ludicrous,,but I'd just gotten past "mangled," and my voice broke,,and I had to stop and collect myself,from the emotional shock and impact that the assault from these words unleashed. 
 You know, of course, this is my raggedy old thesaurus,so I'm thinking this must be an ancient print date, right?,But, in fact, the print date was the early 1980s,,when I would have been starting primary school,and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit,and as related to the other kids and the world around me.,And, needless to say, thank God I wasn't using a thesaurus back then.,I mean, from this entry, it would seem that I was born into a world,that perceived someone like me,to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them,,when in fact, today I'm celebrated for the opportunities and adventures,my life has procured. 
 So, I immediately went to look up the 2009 online edition,,expecting to find a revision worth noting.,Here's the updated version of this entry.,Unfortunately, it's not much better.,I find the last two words under "Near Antonyms," particularly unsettling:,"whole" and "wholesome." 
 So, it's not just about the words.,It's what we believe about people when we name them with these words.,It's about the values behind the words, and how we construct those values.,Our language affects our thinking and how we view the world,and how we view other people.,In fact, many ancient societies, including the Greeks and the Romans,,believed that to utter a curse verbally was so powerful,,because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence.,So, what reality do we want to call into existence:,a person who is limited, or a person who's empowered?,By casually doing something as simple as naming a person, a child,,we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power.,Wouldn't we want to open doors for them instead? 
 One such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor,at the A.I. duPont Institute in Wilmington, Delaware.,His name was Dr. Pizzutillo,,an Italian American, whose name, apparently,,was too difficult for most Americans to pronounce,,so he went by Dr. P.,And Dr. P always wore really colorful bow ties,and had the very perfect disposition to work with children. 
 I loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital,,with the exception of my physical therapy sessions.,I had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises,with these thick, elastic bands -- different colors,,you know -- to help build up my leg muscles,,and I hated these bands more than anything --,I hated them, had names for them. I hated them.,And, you know, I was already bargaining, as a five year-old child,,with Dr. P to try to get out of doing these exercises,,unsuccessfully, of course.,And, one day, he came in to my session --,exhaustive and unforgiving, these sessions --,and he said to me, "Wow. Aimee, you are such a strong and powerful little girl,,I think you're going to break one of those bands.,When you do break it, I'm going to give you a hundred bucks." 
 Now, of course, this was a simple ploy on Dr. P's part,to get me to do the exercises I didn't want to do,before the prospect of being the richest five-year-old in the second floor ward,,but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence,into a new and promising experience for me.,And I have to wonder today to what extent his vision,and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl,shaped my own view of myself,as an inherently strong, powerful and athletic person well into the future. 
 This is an example of how adults in positions of power,can ignite the power of a child.,But, in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries,,our language isn't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want,,the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable.,Our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society,,many of which have been brought about by technology.,Certainly, from a medical standpoint,,my legs, laser surgery for vision impairment,,titanium knees and hip replacements for aging bodies,that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities,,and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them --,not to mention social networking platforms,allow people to self-identify, to claim their own descriptions of themselves,,so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing.,So, perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now,what has always been a truth:,that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society,,and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset. 
 The human ability to adapt, it's an interesting thing,,because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity,,and I'm going to make an admission:,This phrase never sat right with me,,and I always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it,,and I think I'm starting to figure out why.,Implicit in this phrase of "overcoming adversity",is the idea that success, or happiness,,is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience,unscathed or unmarked by the experience,,as if my successes in life have come about from an ability,to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics,,or what other people perceive as my disability.,But, in fact, we are changed. We are marked, of course, by a challenge,,whether physically, emotionally or both.,And I'm going to suggest that this is a good thing.,Adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around,in order to resume living our life.,It's part of our life.,And I tend to think of it like my shadow.,Sometimes I see a lot of it, sometimes there's very little,,but it's always with me.,And, certainly, I'm not trying to diminish the impact, the weight, of a person's struggle. 
 There is adversity and challenge in life,,and it's all very real and relative to every single person,,but the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet adversity,,but how you're going to meet it.,So, our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity,,but preparing them to meet it well.,And we do a disservice to our kids,when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt.,There's an important difference and distinction,between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee,and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not I'm disabled.,And, truthfully, the only real and consistent disability I've had to confront,is the world ever thinking that I could be described by those definitions. 
 In our desire to protect those we care about,by giving them the cold, hard truth about their medical prognosis,,or, indeed, a prognosis on the expected quality of their life,,we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall,that will actually disable someone.,Perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you,and how do we fix it, serves to be more disabling to the individual,than the pathology itself. 
 By not treating the wholeness of a person,,by not acknowledging their potency,,we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have.,We are effectively grading someone's worth to our community.,So we need to see through the pathology,and into the range of human capability.,And, most importantly, there's a partnership,between those perceived deficiencies,and our greatest creative ability.,So it's not about devaluing, or negating, these more trying times,as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug,,but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity.,So maybe the idea I want to put out there is,not so much overcoming adversity,as it is opening ourselves up to it,,embracing it,,grappling with it,,to use a wrestling term,,maybe even dancing with it.,And, perhaps, if we see adversity as natural, consistent and useful,,we're less burdened by the presence of it. 
 This year we celebrate the 200th birthday of Charles Darwin,,and it was 150 years ago, when writing about evolution,,that Darwin illustrated, I think, a truth about the human character.,To paraphrase: It's not the strongest of the species that survives,,nor is it the most intelligent that survives;,it is the one that is most adaptable to change.,Conflict is the genesis of creation.,From Darwin's work, amongst others, we can recognize that,the human ability to survive and flourish,is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict,into transformation.,So, again, transformation, adaptation, is our greatest human skill.,And, perhaps, until we're tested, we don't know what we're made of.,Maybe that's what adversity gives us:,a sense of self, a sense of our own power.,So, we can give ourselves a gift.,We can re-imagine adversity as something more than just tough times.,Maybe we can see it as change.,Adversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves to yet. 
 I think the greatest adversity that we've created for ourselves,is this idea of normalcy.,Now, who's normal?,There's no normal.,There's common, there's typical. There's no normal,,and would you want to meet that poor, beige person if they existed?,(Laughter),I don't think so.,If we can change this paradigm from one of achieving normalcy,to one of possibility -- or potency, to be even a little bit more dangerous --,we can release the power of so many more children,,and invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community. 
 Anthropologists tell us that the one thing,we as humans have always required of our community members,is to be of use, to be able to contribute.,There's evidence that Neanderthals, 60,000 years ago,,carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury,,and perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people,proved of value to the community.,They didn't view these people as broken and useless;,they were seen as rare and valuable. 
 A few years ago, I was in a food market in the town where I grew up,in that red zone in northeastern Pennsylvania,,and I was standing over a bushel of tomatoes.,It was summertime: I had shorts on.,I hear this guy, his voice behind me say, "Well, if it isn't Aimee Mullins.",And I turn around, and it's this older man. I have no idea who he is. 
 And I said, "I'm sorry, sir, have we met? I don't remember meeting you." 
 He said, "Well, you wouldn't remember meeting me.,I mean, when we met I was delivering you from your mother's womb.",(Laughter),Oh, that guy.,And, but of course, actually, it did click. 
 This man was Dr. Kean,,a man that I had only known about through my mother's stories of that day,,because, of course, typical fashion, I arrived late for my birthday by two weeks.,And so my mother's prenatal physician had gone on vacation,,so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents.,And, because I was born without the fibula bones,,and had feet turned in, and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that,,he had to be the bearer -- this stranger had to be the bearer of bad news. 
 He said to me, "I had to give this prognosis to your parents,that you would never walk,,and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have,or any kind of life of independence,,and you've been making liar out of me ever since.",(Laughter),(Applause) 
 The extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved,newspaper clippings throughout my whole childhood,,whether winning a second grade spelling bee,,marching with the Girl Scouts, you know, the Halloween parade,,winning my college scholarship, or any of my sports victories,,and he was using it, and integrating it into teaching resident students,,med students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School.,And he called this part of the course the X Factor,,the potential of the human will.,No prognosis can account for how powerful this could be,as a determinant in the quality of someone's life.,And Dr. Kean went on to tell me,,he said, "In my experience, unless repeatedly told otherwise,,and even if given a modicum of support,,if left to their own devices, a child will achieve." 
 See, Dr. Kean made that shift in thinking.,He understood that there's a difference between the medical condition,and what someone might do with it.,And there's been a shift in my thinking over time,,in that, if you had asked me at 15 years old,,if I would have traded prosthetics for flesh-and-bone legs,,I wouldn't have hesitated for a second.,I aspired to that kind of normalcy back then.,But if you ask me today, I'm not so sure.,And it's because of the experiences I've had with them,,not in spite of the experiences I've had with them.,And perhaps this shift in me has happened,because I've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me,than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me. 
 See, all you really need is one person,to show you the epiphany of your own power, and you're off.,If you can hand somebody the key to their own power --,the human spirit is so receptive -- if you can do that,and open a door for someone at a crucial moment,,you are educating them in the best sense.,You're teaching them to open doors for themselves.,In fact, the exact meaning of the word "educate",comes from the root word "educe.",It means "to bring forth what is within,,to bring out potential.",So again, which potential do we want to bring out? 
 There was a case study done in 1960s Britain,,when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools.,It's called the streaming trials. We call it "tracking" here in the States.,It's separating students from A, B, C, D and so on.,And the "A students" get the tougher curriculum, the best teachers, etc.,Well, they took, over a three-month period,,D-level students, gave them A's,,told them they were "A's," told them they were bright,,and at the end of this three-month period,,they were performing at A-level. 
 And, of course, the heartbreaking, flip side of this study,,is that they took the "A students" and told them they were "D's.",And that's what happened at the end of that three-month period.,Those who were still around in school, besides the people who had dropped out.,A crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too.,The teachers didn't know a switch had been made.,They were simply told, "These are the 'A-students,' these are the 'D-students.'",And that's how they went about teaching them and treating them. 
 So, I think that the only true disability is a crushed spirit,,a spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope,,it doesn't see beauty,,it no longer has our natural, childlike curiosity,and our innate ability to imagine.,If instead, we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope,,to see beauty in themselves and others,,to be curious and imaginative,,then we are truly using our power well.,When a spirit has those qualities, we are able to create new realities,and new ways of being. 
 I'd like to leave you with a poem,by a fourteenth-century Persian poet named Hafiz,that my friend, Jacques Dembois told me about,,and the poem is called "The God Who Only Knows Four Words":,"Every child has known God,,not the God of names,,not the God of don'ts,,but the God who only knows four words and keeps repeating them,,saying, 'Come dance with me.,Come, dance with me. Come, dance with me.'" 
 Thank you.,(Applause)My story is a little bit about war.,It's about disillusionment.,It's about death.,And it's about rediscovering,idealism,in all of that wreckage.,And perhaps also, there's a lesson,about how to deal with,our screwed-up, fragmenting,and dangerous world of the 21st century.,I don't believe in straightforward narratives.,I don't believe in a life or history,written as decision "A" led to consequence "B",led to consequence "C" --,these neat narratives that we're presented with,,and that perhaps we encourage in each other.,I believe in randomness,,and one of the reasons I believe that,is because me becoming a diplomat was random.,I'm colorblind.,I was born unable to see most colors.,This is why I wear gray and black most of the time,,and I have to take my wife with me,to chose clothes. 
 And I'd always wanted to be a fighter pilot when I was a boy.,I loved watching planes barrel over,our holiday home in the countryside.,And it was my boyhood dream to be a fighter pilot.,And I did the tests in the Royal Air Force to become a pilot,,and sure enough, I failed.,I couldn't see all the blinking different lights,,and I can't distinguish color.,So I had to choose another career,,and this was in fact relatively easy for me,,because I had an abiding passion all the way through my childhood,,which was international relations.,As a child,,I read the newspaper thoroughly.,I was fascinated by the Cold War,,by the INF negotiations,over intermediate-range nuclear missiles,,the proxy war between the Soviet Union and the U.S.,in Angola or Afghanistan.,These things really interested me.,And so I decided quite at an early age,I wanted to be a diplomat.,And I, one day, I announced this to my parents --,and my father denies this story to this day --,I said, "Daddy, I want to be a diplomat.",And he turned to me, and he said,,"Carne, you have to be very clever to be a diplomat.",(Laughter),And my ambition was sealed. 
 In 1989,,I entered the British Foreign Service.,That year, 5,000 people applied to become a diplomat,,and 20 of us succeeded.,And as those numbers suggest,,I was inducted into an elite,and fascinating and exhilarating world.,Being a diplomat, then and now,,is an incredible job, and I loved every minute of it --,I enjoyed the status of it.,I bought myself a nice suit and wore leather-soled shoes,and reveled in,this amazing access I had to world events.,I traveled to the Gaza Strip.,I headed the Middle East Peace Process section,in the British Foreign Ministry.,I became a speechwriter,for the British Foreign Secretary.,I met Yasser Arafat.,I negotiated,with Saddam's diplomats at the U.N.,Later, I traveled to Kabul,and served in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban.,And I would travel,in a C-130 transport,and go and visit warlords,in mountain hideaways,and negotiate with them,about how we were going to eradicate Al Qaeda from Afghanistan,,surrounded by my Special Forces escort,,who, themselves, had to have an escort of a platoon of Royal Marines,,because it was so dangerous.,And that was exciting -- that was fun.,It was really interesting.,And it's a great cadre of people,,incredibly close-knit community of people. 
 And the pinnacle of my career, as it turned out,,was when I was posted to New York.,I'd already served in Germany, Norway,,various other places,,but I was posted to New York,to serve on the U.N. Security Council for the British delegation.,And my responsibility was the Middle East,,which was my specialty.,And there, I dealt with things,like the Middle East peace process,,the Lockerbie issue --,we can talk about that later, if you wish --,but above all, my responsibility was Iraq,and its weapons of mass destruction,and the sanctions we placed on Iraq,to oblige it to disarm itself of these weapons.,I was the chief British negotiator,on the subject,,and I was steeped in the issue.,And anyway,,my tour -- it was kind of a very exciting time.,I mean it was very dramatic diplomacy.,We went through several wars,during my time in New York.,I negotiated for my country,the resolution in the Security Council,of the 12th of September 2001,condemning the attacks of the day before,,which were, of course, deeply present to us,actually living in New York at the time.,So it was kind of the best of time, worst of times,kind of experience.,I lived the high-life.,Although I worked very long hours,,I lived in a penthouse in Union Square.,I was a single British diplomat in New York City;,you can imagine what that might have meant.,(Laughter),I had a good time. 
 But in 2002,,when my tour came to an end,,I decided I wasn't going to go back,to the job that was waiting for me in London.,I decided to take a sabbatical,,in fact, at the New School, Bruce.,In some inchoate, inarticulate way,I realized that there was something wrong,with my work, with me.,I was exhausted,,and I was also disillusioned,in a way I couldn't quite put my finger on.,And I decided to take some time out from work.,The Foreign Office was very generous.,You could take these special unpaid leave, as they called them,,and yet remain part of the diplomatic service, but not actually do any work.,It was nice.,And eventually, I decided,to take a secondment to join the U.N. in Kosovo,,which was then under U.N. administration. 
 And two things happened in Kosovo,,which kind of, again,,shows the randomness of life,,because these things turned out to be,two of the pivots of my life,and helped to deliver me to the next stage.,But they were random things.,One was that, in the summer of 2004,,the British government, somewhat reluctantly,,decided to have an official inquiry,into the use of intelligence on WMD,in the run up to the Iraq War,,a very limited subject.,And I testified to that inquiry in secret.,I had been steeped in the intelligence on Iraq,and its WMD,,and my testimony to the inquiry said three things:,that the government exaggerated the intelligence,,which was very clear in all the years I'd read it.,And indeed, our own internal assessment was very clear,that Iraq's WMD,did not pose a threat to its neighbors, let alone to us.,Secondly, the government had ignored all available alternatives to war,,which in some ways,was a more discreditable thing still.,The third reason, I won't go into.,But anyway, I gave that testimony,,and that presented me with a crisis.,What was I going to do?,This testimony was deeply critical of my colleagues,,of my ministers, who had, in my view,had perpetrated a war on a falsehood. 
 And so I was in crisis.,And this wasn't a pretty thing.,I moaned about it, I hesitated,,I went on and on and on to my long-suffering wife,,and eventually I decided to resign from the British Foreign Service.,I felt -- there's a scene in the Al Pacino movie "The Insider," which you may know,,where he goes back to CBS,after they've let him down over the tobacco guy,,and he goes, "You know, I just can't do this anymore. Something's broken.",And it was like that for me. I love that movie.,I felt just something's broken.,I can't actually sit with my foreign minister,or my prime minister again with a smile on my face,and do what I used to do gladly for them.,So took a running leap,and jumped over the edge of a cliff. 
 And it was a very, very uncomfortable, unpleasant feeling.,And I started to fall.,And today, that fall hasn't stopped;,I'm still falling.,But, in a way, I've got used to the sensation of it.,And in a way, I kind of like,the sensation of it a lot better,than I like actually standing on top of the cliff,,wondering what to do.,A second thing happened in Kosovo,,which kind of -- I need a quick gulp of water, forgive me.,A second thing happened in Kosovo,,which kind of delivered the answer,,which I couldn't really answer,,which is, "What do I do with my life?",I love diplomacy --,I have no career --,I expected my entire life to be a diplomat, to be serving my country.,I wanted to be an ambassador,,and my mentors, my heroes,,people who got to the top of my profession,,and here I was throwing it all away.,A lot of my friends were still in it.,My pension was in it.,And I gave it up.,And what was I going to do? 
 And that year, in Kosovo,,this terrible, terrible thing happened, which I saw.,In March 2004, there were terrible riots,all over the province -- as it then was -- of Kosovo.,18 people were killed.,It was anarchy.,And it's a very horrible thing to see anarchy,,to know that the police and the military --,there were lots of military troops there --,actually can't stop that rampaging mob,who's coming down the street.,And the only way that rampaging mob coming down the street will stop,is when they decide to stop,and when they've had enough burning and killing.,And that is not a very nice feeling to see, and I saw it.,And I went through it. I went through those mobs.,And with my Albanian friends, we tried to stop it, but we failed.,And that riot taught me something,,which isn't immediately obvious and it's kind of a complicated story. 
 But one of the reasons that riot took place --,those riots, which went on for several days, took place --,was because the Kosovo people,were disenfranchised from their own future.,There were diplomatic negotiations about the future of Kosovo,going on then,,and the Kosovo government, let alone the Kosovo people,,were not actually,participating in those talks.,There was this whole fancy diplomatic system,,this negotiation process about the future of Kosovo,,and the Kosovars weren't part of it.,And funnily enough, they were frustrated about that.,Those riots were part of the manifestation of that frustration.,It wasn't the only reason,,and life is not simple, one reason narratives.,It was a complicated thing,,and I'm not pretending it was more simple than it was.,But that was one of the reasons. 
 And that kind of gave me the inspiration --,or rather to be precise,,it gave my wife the inspiration.,She said, "Why don't you advise the Kosovars?,Why don't you advise their government on their diplomacy?",And the Kosovars were not allowed a diplomatic service.,They were not allowed diplomats.,They were not allowed a foreign office,to help them deal with this immensely complicated process,,which became known as the Final Status Process of Kosovo.,And so that was the idea.,That was the origin of the thing that became Independent Diplomat,,the world's first diplomatic advisory group,and a non-profit to boot.,And it began when I flew back from London,after my time at the U.N. in Kosovo.,I flew back and had dinner with the Kosovo prime minister and said to him,,"Look, I'm proposing that I come and advise you on the diplomacy.,I know this stuff. It's what I do. Why don't I come and help you?",And he raised his glass of raki to me and said,,"Yes, Carne. Come." 
 And I came to Kosovo,and advised the Kosovo government.,Independent Diplomat ended up advising three successive Kosovo prime ministers,and the multi-party negotiation team of Kosovo.,And Kosovo became independent.,Independent Diplomat is now established,in five diplomatic centers around the world,,and we're advising seven or eight,different countries, or political groups,,depending on how you wish to define them --,and I'm not big on definitions.,We're advising the Northern Cypriots on how to reunify their island.,We're advising the Burmese opposition,,the government of Southern Sudan,,which -- you heard it here first --,is going to be a new country within the next few years.,We're advising the Polisario Front of the Western Sahara,,who are fighting to get their country back,from Moroccan occupation,after 34 years of dispossession.,We're advising various island states in the climate change negotiations,,which is suppose to culminate,in Copenhagen. 
 There's a bit of randomness here too,because, when I was beginning Independent Diplomat,,I went to a party in the House of Lords,,which is a ridiculous place,,but I was holding my drink like this, and I bumped into,this guy who was standing behind me.,And we started talking, and he said --,I told him what I was doing,,and I told him rather grandly,I was going to establish Independent Diplomat in New York.,At that time there was just me --,and me and my wife were moving back to New York.,And he said, "Why don't you see my colleagues in New York?",And it turned out,he worked for an innovation company called ?What If!,,which some of you have probably heard of.,And one thing led to another,,and I ended up having a desk,in ?What If! in New York,,when I started Independent Diplomat.,And watching ?What If!,develop new flavors of chewing gum for Wrigley,or new flavors for Coke,actually helped me innovate,new strategies for the Kosovars,and for the Saharawis of the Western Sahara.,And I began to realize that there are different ways of doing diplomacy --,that diplomacy, like business,,is a business of solving problems,,and yet the word innovation doesn't exist in diplomacy;,it's all zero sum games and realpolitik,and ancient institutions that have been there for generations,and do things the same way they've always done things. 
 And Independent Diplomat, today,,tries to incorporate some of the things I learned at ?What If!.,We all sit in one office and shout at each other across the office.,We all work on little laptops and try to move desks to change the way we think.,And we use naive experts,who may know nothing about the countries we're dealing with,,but may know something about something else,to try to inject new thinking,into the problems,that we try to address for our clients.,It's not easy, because our clients, by definition,,are having a difficult time, diplomatically. 
 There are, I don't know,,some lessons from all of this,,personal and political --,and in a way, they're the same thing.,The personal one,is falling off a cliff,is actually a good thing, and I recommend it.,And it's a good thing to do at least once in your life,just to tear everything up and jump.,The second thing is a bigger lesson about the world today.,Independent Diplomat is part of a trend,which is emerging and evident across the world,,which is that the world is fragmenting.,States mean less than they used to,,and the power of the state is declining.,That means the power of others things is rising.,Those other things are called non-state actors.,They may be corporations,,they may be mafiosi, they may be nice NGOs,,they may anything,,any number of things.,We are living in a more complicated and fragmented world.,If governments are less able,to affect the problems,that affect us in the world,,then that means, who is left to deal with them,,who has to take greater responsibility to deal with them?,Us.,If they can't do it, who's left to deal with it?,We have no choice but to embrace that reality. 
 What this means is,it's no longer good enough,to say that international relations, or global affairs,,or chaos in Somalia,,or what's going on in Burma is none of your business,,and that you can leave it to governments to get on with.,I can connect any one of you,by six degrees of separation,to the Al-Shabaab militia in Somalia.,Ask me how later, particularly if you eat fish, interestingly enough,,but that connection is there.,We are all intimately connected.,And this isn't just Tom Friedman,,it's actually provable in case after case after case.,What that means is, instead of asking your politicians to do things,,you have to look to yourself to do things.,And Independent Diplomat is a kind of example of this,in a sort of loose way. 
 There aren't neat examples, but one example is this:,the way the world is changing,is embodied in what's going on at the place I used to work --,the U.N. Security Council.,The U.N. was established in 1945.,Its charter is basically designed,to stop conflicts between states --,interstate conflict.,Today, 80 percent of the agenda,of the U.N. Security Council,is about conflicts within states,,involving non-state parties --,guerillas, separatists,,terrorists, if you want to call them that,,people who are not normal governments, who are not normal states.,That is the state of the world today.,When I realized this,,and when I look back on my time at the Security Council,and what happened with the Kosovars,,and I realize that often,the people who were most directly affected,by what we were doing in the Security Council,weren't actually there, weren't actually invited,to give their views to the Security Council,,I thought, this is wrong.,Something's got to be done about this. 
 So I started off in a traditional mode.,Me and my colleagues at Independent Diplomat,went around the U.N. Security Council.,We went around 70 U.N. member states --,the Kazaks, the Ethiopians, the Israelis --,you name them, we went to see them --,the secretary general, all of them,,and said, "This is all wrong.,This is terrible that you don't consult these people who are actually affected.,You've got to institutionalize a system,where you actually invite the Kosovars,to come and tell you what they think.,This will allow you to tell me -- you can tell them what you think.,It'll be great. You can have an exchange.,You can actually incorporate these people's views into your decisions,,which means your decisions will be more effective and durable.",Super-logical, you would think.,I mean, incredibly logical. So obvious, anybody could get it.,And of course, everybody got it. Everybody went, "Yes, of course, you're absolutely right.,Come back to us,in maybe six months.",And of course, nothing happened -- nobody did anything.,The Security Council does its business,in exactly the same way today,that it did X number of years ago,,when I was there 10 years ago. 
 So we looked at that observation,of basically failure,and thought, what can we do about it.,And I thought, I'm buggered,if I'm going to spend the rest of my life,lobbying for these crummy governments,to do what needs to be done.,So what we're going to do,is we're actually going to set up these meetings ourselves.,So now, Independent Diplomat,is in the process of setting up meetings,between the U.N. Security Council,and the parties to the disputes,that are on the agenda of the Security Council.,So we will be bringing,Darfuri rebel groups,,the Northern Cypriots and the Southern Cypriots,,rebels from Aceh,,and awful long laundry list,of chaotic conflicts around the world.,And we will be trying to bring the parties to New York,to sit down in a quiet room,in a private setting with no press,and actually explain what they want,to the members of the U. N. Security Council,,and for the members of the U.N. Security Council,to explain to them what they want.,So there's actually a conversation,,which has never before happened.,And of course, describing all this,,any of you who know politics will think this is incredibly difficult,,and I entirely agree with you.,The chances of failure are very high,,but it certainly won't happen,if we don't try to make it happen. 
 And my politics has changed fundamentally,from when I was a diplomat to what I am today,,and I think that outputs is what matters, not process,,not technology, frankly, so much either.,Preach technology,to all the Twittering members of all the Iranian demonstrations,who are now in political prison in Tehran,,where Ahmadinejad remains in power.,Technology has not delivered political change in Iran.,You've got to look at the outputs, and you got to say to yourself,,"What can I do to produce that particular output?",That is the politics of the 21st century,,and in a way, Independent Diplomat,embodies that fragmentation, that change,,that is happening to all of us. 
 That's my story. Thanks.I'm a cancer doctor, and I walked out of my office,and walked by the pharmacy in the hospital three or four years ago,,and this was the cover of Fortune magazine,sitting in the window of the pharmacy. 
 And so, as a cancer doctor, you look at this,,and you get a little bit downhearted.,But when you start to read the article by Cliff,,who himself is a cancer survivor,,who was saved by a clinical trial,where his parents drove him from New York City to upstate New York,to get an experimental therapy for --,at the time -- Hodgkin's disease, which saved his life,,he makes remarkable points here.,And the point of the article was that we have gotten,reductionist in our view of biology,,in our view of cancer.,For the last 50 years, we have focused on treating,the individual gene,in understanding cancer, not in controlling cancer. 
 So, this is an astounding table.,And this is something that sobers us in our field everyday,in that, obviously, we've made remarkable impacts,on cardiovascular disease,,but look at cancer. The death rate in cancer,in over 50 years hasn't changed.,We've made small wins in diseases like chronic myelogenous leukemia,,where we have a pill that can put 100 percent of people in remission,,but in general, we haven't made an impact at all in the war on cancer. 
 So, what I'm going to tell you today,,is a little bit of why I think that's the case,,and then go out of my comfort zone,and tell you where I think it's going,,where a new approach -- that we hope to push forward,in terms of treating cancer.,Because this is wrong. 
 So, what is cancer, first of all?,Well, if one has a mass or an abnormal blood value, you go to a doctor,,they stick a needle in.,They way we make the diagnosis today is by pattern recognition:,Does it look normal? Does it look abnormal? 
 So, that pathologist is just like looking at this plastic bottle.,This is a normal cell. This is a cancer cell.,That is the state-of-the-art today in diagnosing cancer.,There's no molecular test,,there's no sequencing of genes that was referred to yesterday,,there's no fancy looking at the chromosomes.,This is the state-of-the-art and how we do it. 
 You know, I know very well, as a cancer doctor, I can't treat advanced cancer.,So, as an aside, I firmly believe in the field of trying to identify cancer early.,It is the only way you can start to fight cancer, is by catching it early.,We can prevent most cancers.,You know, the previous talk alluded to preventing heart disease.,We could do the same in cancer.,I co-founded a company called Navigenics,,where, if you spit into a tube --,and we can look look at 35 or 40 genetic markers for disease,,all of which are delayable in many of the cancers --,you start to identify what you could get,,and then we can start to work to prevent them.,Because the problem is, when you have advanced cancer,,we can't do that much today about it, as the statistics allude to. 
 So, the thing about cancer is that it's a disease of the aged.,Why is it a disease of the aged?,Because evolution doesn't care about us after we've had our children.,See, evolution protected us during our childbearing years,and then, after age 35 or 40 or 45,,it said "It doesn't matter anymore, because they've had their progeny.",So if you look at cancers, it is very rare -- extremely rare --,to have cancer in a child, on the order of thousands of cases a year.,As one gets older? Very, very common. 
 Why is it hard to treat?,Because it's heterogeneous,,and that's the perfect substrate for evolution within the cancer.,It starts to select out for those bad, aggressive cells,,what we call clonal selection.,But, if we start to understand,that cancer isn't just a molecular defect, it's something more,,then we'll get to new ways of treating it, as I'll show you. 
 So, one of the fundamental problems we have in cancer,is that, right now, we describe it by a number of adjectives, symptoms:,"I'm tired, I'm bloated, I have pain, etc.",You then have some anatomic descriptions,,you get that CT scan: "There's a three centimeter mass in the liver.",You then have some body part descriptions:,"It's in the liver, in the breast, in the prostate.",And that's about it.,So, our dictionary for describing cancer is very, very poor.,It's basically symptoms.,It's manifestations of a disease. 
 What's exciting is that over the last two or three years,,the government has spent 400 million dollars,,and they've allocated another billion dollars,,to what we call the Cancer Genome Atlas Project.,So, it is the idea of sequencing all of the genes in the cancer,,and giving us a new lexicon, a new dictionary to describe it.,You know, in the mid-1850's in France,,they started to describe cancer by body part.,That hasn't changed in over 150 years.,It is absolutely archaic that we call cancer,by prostate, by breast, by muscle.,It makes no sense, if you think about it. 
 So, obviously, the technology is here today,,and, over the next several years, that will change.,You will no longer go to a breast cancer clinic.,You will go to a HER2 amplified clinic, or an EGFR activated clinic,,and they will go to some of the pathogenic lesions,that were involved in causing this individual cancer.,So, hopefully, we will go from being the art of medicine,more to the science of medicine,,and be able to do what they do in infectious disease,,which is look at that organism, that bacteria,,and then say, "This antibiotic makes sense,,because you have a particular bacteria that will respond to it.",When one is exposed to H1N1, you take Tamiflu,,and you can remarkably decrease the severity of symptoms,and prevent many of the manifestations of the disease.,Why? Because we know what you have, and we know how to treat it --,although we can't make vaccine in this country, but that's a different story. 
 The Cancer Genome Atlas is coming out now.,The first cancer was done, which was brain cancer.,In the next month, the end of December, you'll see ovarian cancer,,and then lung cancer will come several months after.,There's also a field of proteomics that I'll talk about in a few minutes,,which I think is going to be the next level,in terms of understanding and classifying disease.,But remember, I'm not pushing genomics,,proteomics, to be a reductionist.,I'm doing it so we can identify what we're up against.,And there's a very important distinction there that we'll get to. 
 In health care today, we spend most of the dollars --,in terms of treating disease --,most of the dollars in the last two years of a person's life.,We spend very little, if any, dollars in terms of identifying what we're up against.,If you could start to move that, to identify what you're up against,,you're going to do things a hell of a lot better.,If we could even take it one step further and prevent disease,,we can take it enormously the other direction,,and obviously, that's where we need to go, going forward. 
 So, this is the website of the National Cancer Institute.,And I'm here to tell you, it's wrong.,So, the website of the National Cancer Institute,says that cancer is a genetic disease.,The website says, "If you look, there's an individual mutation,,and maybe a second, and maybe a third,,and that is cancer.",But, as a cancer doc, this is what I see.,This isn't a genetic disease.,So, there you see, it's a liver with colon cancer in it,,and you see into the microscope a lymph node,where cancer has invaded.,You see a CT scan where cancer is in the liver.,Cancer is an interaction of a cell,that no longer is under growth control with the environment.,It's not in the abstract; it's the interaction with the environment.,It's what we call a system. 
 The goal of me as a cancer doctor is not to understand cancer.,And I think that's been the fundamental problem over the last five decades,,is that we have strived to understand cancer.,The goal is to control cancer.,And that is a very different optimization scheme,,a very different strategy for all of us. 
 I got up at the American Association of Cancer Research,,one of the big cancer research meetings, with 20,000 people there,,and I said, "We've made a mistake.,We've all made a mistake, myself included,,by focusing down, by being a reductionist.,We need to take a step back.",And, believe it or not, there were hisses in the audience.,People got upset, but this is the only way we're going to go forward. 
 You know, I was very fortunate to meet Danny Hillis a few years ago.,We were pushed together, and neither one of us really wanted to meet the other.,I said, "Do I really want to meet a guy from Disney, who designed computers?",And he was saying: Does he really want to meet another doctor?,But people prevailed on us, and we got together,,and it's been transformative in what I do, absolutely transformative.,We have designed, and we have worked on the modeling --,and much of these ideas came from Danny and from his team --,the modeling of cancer in the body as complex system.,And I'll show you some data there,where I really think it can make a difference and a new way to approach it. 
 The key is, when you look at these variables and you look at this data,,you have to understand the data inputs.,You know, if I measured your temperature over 30 days,,and I asked, "What was the average temperature?",and it came back at 98.7, I would say, "Great.",But if during one of those days,your temperature spiked to 102 for six hours,,and you took Tylenol and got better, etc.,,I would totally miss it.,So, one of the problems, the fundamental problems in medicine,is that you and I, and all of us,,we go to our doctor once a year.,We have discrete data elements; we don't have a time function on them. 
 Earlier it was referred to this direct life device.,You know, I've been using it for two and a half months.,It's a staggering device, not because it tells me,how many kilocalories I do every day,,but because it looks, over 24 hours, what I've done in a day.,And I didn't realize that for three hours I'm sitting at my desk,,and I'm not moving at all.,And a lot of the functions in the data that we have as input systems here,are really different than we understand them,,because we're not measuring them dynamically. 
 And so, if you think of cancer as a system,,there's an input and an output and a state in the middle.,So, the states, are equivalent classes of history,,and the cancer patient, the input, is the environment,,the diet, the treatment, the genetic mutations.,The output are our symptoms:,Do we have pain? Is the cancer growing? Do we feel bloated, etc.?,Most of that state is hidden.,So what we do in our field is we change and input,,we give aggressive chemotherapy,,and we say, "Did that output get better? Did that pain improve, etc.?" 
 And so, the problem is that it's not just one system,,it's multiple systems on multiple scales.,It's a system of systems.,And so, when you start to look at emergent systems,,you can look at a neuron under a microscope.,A neuron under the microscope is very elegant,with little things sticking out and little things over here,,but when you start to put them together in a complex system,,and you start to see that it becomes a brain,,and that brain can create intelligence,,what we're talking about in the body,,and cancer is starting to model it like a complex system.,Well, the bad news is that these robust --,and robust is a key word --,emergent systems are very hard to understand in detail.,The good news is you can manipulate them.,You can try to control them,without that fundamental understanding of every component. 
 One of the most fundamental clinical trials in cancer,came out in February in the New England Journal of Medicine,,where they took women who were pre-menopausal with breast cancer.,So, about the worst kind of breast cancer you can get.,They had gotten their chemotherapy,,and then they randomized them,,where half got placebo,,and half got a drug called Zoledronic acid that builds bone.,It's used to treat osteoporosis,,and they got that twice a year.,They looked and, in these 1,800 women,,given twice a year a drug that builds bone,,you reduce the recurrence of cancer by 35 percent.,Reduce occurrence of cancer by a drug,that doesn't even touch the cancer.,So the notion, you change the soil, the seed doesn't grow as well.,You change that system,,and you could have a marked effect on the cancer. 
 Nobody has ever shown -- and this will be shocking --,nobody has ever shown that most chemotherapy,actually touches a cancer cell.,It's never been shown.,There's all these elegant work in the tissue culture dishes,,that if you give this cancer drug, you can do this effect to the cell,,but the doses in those dishes are nowhere near,the doses that happen in the body. 
 If I give a woman with breast cancer a drug called Taxol,every three weeks, which is the standard,,about 40 percent of women with metastatic cancer,have a great response to that drug.,And a response is 50 percent shrinkage.,Well, remember that's not even an order of magnitude,,but that's a different story.,They then recur, I give them that same drug every week.,Another 30 percent will respond.,They then recur, I give them that same drug,over 96 hours by continuous infusion,,another 20 or 30 percent will respond.,So, you can't tell me it's working by the same mechanism in all three size.,It's not. We have no idea the mechanism.,So the idea that chemotherapy may just be disrupting,that complex system,,just like building bone disrupted that system and reduced recurrence,,chemotherapy may work by that same exact way.,The wild thing about that trial also,,was that it reduced new primaries, so new cancers, by 30 percent also. 
 So, the problem is, yours and mine, all of our systems are changing.,They're dynamic.,I mean, this is a scary slide, not to take an aside,,but it looks at obesity in the world.,And I'm sorry if you can't read the numbers, they're kind of small.,But, if you start to look at it, that red, that dark color there,,more than 75 percent of the population,of those countries are obese.,Look a decade ago, look two decades ago: markedly different.,So, our systems today are dramatically different,than our systems a decade or two ago.,So the diseases we have today,,which reflect patterns in the system over the last several decades,,are going to change dramatically over the next decade or so,based on things like this. 
 So, this picture, although it is beautiful, is a 40-gigabyte picture,of the whole proteome.,So this is a drop of blood that has gone through a superconducting magnet,,and we're able to get resolution,where we can start to see all of the proteins in the body.,We can start to see that system.,Each of the red dots are where a protein has actually been identified.,The power of these magnets, the power of what we can do here,,is that we can see an individual neutron with this technology.,So, again, this is stuff we're doing with Danny Hillis,and a group called Applied Proteomics,,where we can start to see individual neutron differences,,and we can start to look at that system like we never have before.,So, instead of a reductionist view, we're taking a step back. 
 So this is a woman, 46 years old,,who had recurrent lung cancer.,It was in her brain, in her lungs, in her liver.,She had gotten Carboplatin Taxol, Carboplatin Taxotere,,Gemcitabine, Navelbine:,Every drug we have she had gotten, and that disease continued to grow.,She had three kids under the age of 12,,and this is her CT scan.,And so what this is, is we're taking a cross-section of her body here,,and you can see in the middle there is her heart,,and to the side of her heart on the left there is this large tumor,that will invade and will kill her, untreated, in a matter of weeks.,She goes on a pill a day that targets a pathway,,and again, I'm not sure if this pathway was in the system, in the cancer,,but it targeted a pathway, and a month later, pow, that cancer's gone.,Six months later it's still gone.,That cancer recurred, and she passed away three years later from lung cancer,,but she got three years from a drug,whose symptoms predominately were acne.,That's about it. 
 So, the problem is that the clinical trial was done,,and we were a part of it,,and in the fundamental clinical trial --,the pivotal clinical trial we call the Phase Three,,we refused to use a placebo.,Would you want your mother, your brother, your sister,to get a placebo if they had advanced lung cancer and had weeks to live?,And the answer, obviously, is not.,So, it was done on this group of patients.,Ten percent of people in the trial had this dramatic response that was shown here,,and the drug went to the FDA,,and the FDA said, "Without a placebo,,how do I know patients actually benefited from the drug?",So the morning the FDA was going to meet,,this was the editorial in the Wall Street Journal.,(Laughter),And so, what do you know, that drug was approved. 
 The amazing thing is another company did the right scientific trial,,where they gave half placebo and half the drug.,And we learned something important there.,What's interesting is they did it in South America and Canada,,where it's "more ethical to give placebos.",They had to give it also in the U.S. to get approval,,so I think there were three U.S. patients,in upstate New York who were part of the trial.,But they did that, and what they found,is that 70 percent of the non-responders,lived much longer and did better than people who got placebo.,So it challenged everything we knew in cancer,,is that you don't need to get a response.,You don't need to shrink the disease.,If we slow the disease, we may have more of a benefit,on patient survival, patient outcome, how they feel,,than if we shrink the disease. 
 The problem is that, if I'm this doc, and I get your CT scan today,and you've got a two centimeter mass in your liver,,and you come back to me in three months and it's three centimeters,,did that drug help you or not?,How do I know?,Would it have been 10 centimeters, or am I giving you a drug,with no benefit and significant cost?,So, it's a fundamental problem.,And, again, that's where these new technologies can come in. 
 And so, the goal obviously is that you go into your doctor's office --,well, the ultimate goal is that you prevent disease, right?,The ultimate goal is that you prevent any of these things from happening.,That is the most effective, cost-effective,,best way we can do things today.,But if one is unfortunate to get a disease,,you'll go into your doctor's office, he or she will take a drop of blood,,and we will start to know how to treat your disease.,The way we've approached it is the field of proteomics,,again, this looking at the system.,It's taking a big picture. 
 The problem with technologies like this is,that if one looks at proteins in the body,,there are 11 orders of magnitude difference,between the high-abundant and the low-abundant proteins.,So, there's no technology in the world that can span 11 orders of magnitude.,And so, a lot of what has been done with people like Danny Hillis and others,is to try to bring in engineering principles, try to bring the software.,We can start to look at different components along this spectrum. 
 And so, earlier was talked about cross-discipline, about collaboration.,And I think one of the exciting things that is starting to happen now,is that people from those fields are coming in.,Yesterday, the National Cancer Institute announced a new program,called the Physical Sciences and Oncology,,where physicists, mathematicians, are brought in to think about cancer,,people who never approached it before.,Danny and I got 16 million dollars, they announced yesterday,,to try to attach this problem.,A whole new approach, instead of giving high doses of chemotherapy,by different mechanisms,,to try to bring technology to get a picture of what's actually happening in the body. 
 So, just for two seconds, how these technologies work --,because I think it's important to understand it.,What happens is every protein in your body is charged,,so the proteins are sprayed in, the magnet spins them around,,and then there's a detector at the end.,When it hit that detector is dependent on the mass and the charge.,And so we can accurately -- if the magnet is big enough,,and your resolution is high enough --,you can actually detect all of the proteins in the body,and start to get an understanding of the individual system. 
 And so, as a cancer doctor,,instead of having paper in my chart, in your chart, and it being this thick,,this is what data flow is starting to look like in our offices,,where that drop of blood is creating gigabytes of data.,Electronic data elements are describing every aspect of the disease.,And certainly the goal is we can start to learn from every encounter,and actually move forward, instead of just having encounter and encounter,,without fundamental learning. 
 So, to conclude, we need to get away from reductionist thinking.,We need to start to think differently and radically.,And so, I implore everyone here: Think differently. Come up with new ideas.,Tell them to me or anyone else in our field,,because over the last 59 years, nothing has changed.,We need a radically different approach. 
 You know, Andy Grove stepped down as chairman of the board at Intel --,and Andy was one of my mentors, tough individual.,When Andy stepped down, he said,,"No technology will win. Technology itself will win.",And I'm a firm believer, in the field of medicine and especially cancer,,that it's going to be a broad platform of technologies,that will help us move forward,and hopefully help patients in the near-term. 
 Thank you very much.For some time I have been interested in,the placebo effect,,which might seem like an odd thing,for a magician to be interested in,,unless you think of it in the terms that I do,,which is, "Something fake,is believed in enough by somebody,that it becomes something real.",In other words, sugar pills,have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies,,the placebo effect,,just because the person thinks,that what's happening to them is a pharmaceutical,or some sort of a --,for pain management, for example,,if they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the body,called the placebo effect.,Something fake becomes,something real,because of someone's perception of it. 
 In order for us to understand each other,,I want to start by showing you a rudimentary,,very simple magic trick.,And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a trick,that's been in every children's magic book since at least the 1950s.,I learned it myself from Cub Scout Magic in the 1970s.,I'll do it for you, and then I'll explain it.,And then I'll explain why I explained it. 
 So, here's what happens.,The knife, which you can examine; my hand, which you could examine.,I'm just going to hold the knife in my fist like this.,I'll get my sleeve back.,And to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve,I'm just going to squeeze my wrist right here.,That way you can see that at no time,can anything travel, as long as I'm squeezing there,nothing can go up or down my sleeve.,And the object of this is quite simple.,I'm going to open my hand,,and hopefully, if all is well,,my pure animal magnetism will hold the knife.,In fact it's held so tightly in place,that I can shake it,,and the knife does not come off.,Nothing goes up or down my sleeve,,no trickery. And you can examine everything.,Ta-da!,(Applause) 
 So, this is a trick that I often teach to young children,that are interested in magic, because you can learn,a great deal about deception by studying,this very -- even though it's a very simple trick methodologically.,Probably many of you in the room know this trick.,What happens is this.,I hold the knife in my hand.,I say I'm going to grab hold of my wrist,to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve,,that is a lie. 
 The reason I'm holding onto my wrist,is because that's actually the secret,of the illusion.,In a moment when my hand moves from facing you,to being away from you,,this finger right here, my index finger is just going to shift,from where it is, to a position,pointing out like this.,Nice one.,Someone who didn't have a childhood is out there.,(Laughter) 
 So, it goes like this, from here, right.,And as I move around my finger shifts.,And we could talk about why this is deceptive,,why you don't notice there are only three fingers down here,,because the mind, and the way it processes information,,it doesn't count, one, two, three. It groups them.,But that's not really what this is about. Right? And then I open my hand up.,Obviously it's clinging there, not by animal magnetism,,but by chicanery,,my index finger being there.,And then when I close my finger, same thing,,as I move back, this motion,kind of covers the moving back of my finger.,I take this hand away. You give the knife out.,There is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors. Thanks. 
 Now, (Laughter),what does that have to do with the placebo effect?,I read a study a year or so ago,that really blew my mind wide open.,I'm not a doctor or a researcher, so this, to me,,was an astonishing thing.,It turns out that if you administer,a placebo in the form of a white pill,,that's like aspirin shaped --,it's just a round white pill -- it has some certain measurable effect.,But if you change the form that you give the placebo in,,like you make a smaller pill,,and color it blue, and stamp a letter into it,,it is actually measurably more effective.,Even though neither one of these things,has any pharmaceutical -- they're sugar pills.,But a white pill is not as good as a blue pill.,What? (Laughter) That really flipped me out. 
 Turns out though, that that's not even where it stops.,If you have capsules,,they're more effective than tablets in any form.,A colored capsule, that's yellow on one end and red on the other,is better than a white capsule.,Dosage has something to do with this.,One pill twice a day,is not as good at three pills --,I don't remember the statistic now. Sorry.,But the point is ...,(Laughter) ... these dosages have something to do with it.,And the form has something to do with it.,And if you want the ultimate in placebo,,you've go to the needle.,Right? A syringe with some inert --,a couple CCs of some inert something,,and you inject this into a patient ...,Well this is such a powerful image in their mind,,it's so much stronger than the white pill. 
 It's a really, this graph, well I'll show it to you,some other time when we have slides.,The point is,the white pill is not as good as the blue pill,is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle.,And none of it has any real pharmaceutical quality,,it's only your belief that makes it real,in your body and makes a stronger effect.,I wanted to see if I could take that idea,and apply it to a magic trick.,And take something that is obviously a fake trick,and make it seem real.,And we know from that study,that when you want reality, you go to the needle. 
 This is a seven-inch hatpin. It's very, very sharp,,and I'm going to just sterilize it a tiny bit.,This is really my flesh. This is not,Damian's special-grown flesh.,That's my skin right there. This is not a Hollywood special effect.,I'm going to pierce my skin,and run this needle through to the other side. 
 If you're queasy -- (Laughs),if you faint easily -- I was doing this for some friends,in the hotel room last night, and some people that I didn't know,,and one woman almost passed out.,So, I suggest if you get queasy easy,that you look away for about the next 30 --,in fact, you know what, I'll do the first bad part behind it.,You'll get to see, you can look away too if you'd like to. 
 So, here is what happens, right here,,the beginning of my flesh,at the lower part of my arm I just make,a little pierce.,I'm sorry, man. Am I freaking you out?,OK, and then just through my skin a tiny bit,,and then out the other side like this.,Now, essentially we're in the same position we were in,with the knife trick.,(Laughter),Sort of.,But you can't count my fingers right now can you?,So, let me show them to you. That's one, two,three, four, five.,Yes, well... 
 I know what people think when they see this.,They go, "Well, he's certainly not dumb enough,to stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes.,So, let me give you a little peek.,How's that look out there? Pretty good.,(Laughs),Yeah, I know. (Laughs),And the people in the back go, "OK, I didn't really see that.",People in the satellite room are starting to move in now.,Let me give you good close look at this.,That really is my skin. That is not a Hollywood special effect.,That's my flesh, and I can twist that around.,I'm sorry. If you're getting queasy, look away,,don't look at the thing. 
 People in the back or people on video years from now watching this,will go, "Well yeah, that looks kind of neat,in some sort of effect there, but if it were real he would be --,see there's a hole there and a hole there, if it were real he would be bleeding.,Well let me work up some blood for you.,(Laughter),Yes, there it is.,(Applause),(Laughter) 
 Normally now, I would take the needle out.,I would clean off my arm, and I would show you that there are no wounds.,But I think in this context,and with the idea of taking something fake,and making it into something real,,I'm just going to leave it there,,and walk off the stage.,(Laughter),I will be seeing you several times over the next few days.,I hope you're looking forward to that. Thank you very much.,(Laughter),(Applause)Does anybody know when the stethoscope was invented?,Any guesses? 1816.,And what I can say is, in 2016,,doctors aren't going to be walking around with stethoscopes.,There's a whole lot better technology coming,,and that's part of the change in medicine. 
 What has changed our society,has been wireless devices.,But the future are digital medical wireless devices, OK? 
 So, let me give you some examples of this,to kind of make this much more concrete.,This is the first one. This is an electrocardiogram.,And, as a cardiologist, to think that you could see in real time,a patient, an individual, anywhere in the world,on your smartphone,,watching your rhythm -- that's incredible,,and it's with us today. 
 But that's just the beginning.,You check your email while you're sitting here.,In the future you're going to be checking all your vital signs,,all your vital signs: your heart rhythm,,your blood pressure, your oxygen, your temperature, etc.,This is already available today. 
 This is AirStrip Technologies.,It's now wired -- or I should say, wireless --,by taking the aggregate of these signals,in the hospital, in the intensive care unit,,and putting it on a smartphone for physicians.,If you're an expectant parent,,what about the ability to monitor, continuously,,fetal heart rate, or intrauterine contractions,,and not having to worry so much that things are,fine as the pregnancy,,and moving over into the time of delivery? 
 And then as we go further,,today we have continuous glucose sensors.,Right now, they are under the skin,,but in the future, they won't have to be implanted.,And of course, the desired range -- trying to keep glucose,between 75 and less than 200,,checking it every five minutes in a continuous glucose sensor --,you'll see how that can impact diabetes. 
 And what about sleep?,We're going to zoom in on that a little bit.,We're supposed to spend a third of our life in sleep.,What if, on your phone,,which will be available in the next few weeks,,you had every minute of your sleep displayed?,And this is, of course, as you can see, the awake is the orange.,The REM sleep, rapid eye movement,,dream state, is in light green;,and light is gray, light sleep;,and deep sleep, the best restorative sleep,,is that dark green. 
 How about counting every calorie?,And this is ability, in real time, to actually take,measurements of caloric intake,as well as expenditure, through a Band-Aid. 
 Now, what I've talked about are physiologic metrics.,But what I want to get to, the next frontier,,very quickly, and why the stethoscope,is on its way out,,is because we can transcend listening to the valve sounds,,and the breath sounds, because now,,introduced by G.E. is a handheld ultra-sound.,Why is this important? Because this is so much more sensitive.,Here is an example of an abdominal ultrasound,,and also a cardiac echo, which can be sent wireless,,and then there's an example of fetal monitoring on your smartphone. 
 So, we're not just talking about physiologic metrics --,the key measurements of vital signs,,and all those things in physiology -- but also all the imaging,that one could look at in your smartphone.,Now, this is an example of another obsolete technology,,soon to be buried: the Holter Monitor.,Twenty-four hour recording, lots of wires.,This is now a little tiny patch.,You can put it on for two weeks,and send it in the mail. 
 Now, how does this work? Well,,there is these smart Band-Aids or these sensors,that one would put on, on a shoe or on the wrist.,And this sends a signal,and it creates a body area network to a gateway.,Gateway could be a smartphone or it could be a dedicated gateway,,as today many of these things are dedicated gateways,,because they are not so well integrated.,That signal goes to the web, the cloud,,and then it can be processed and sent anywhere:,to a caregiver, to a physician,,back to the patient, etc.,So, that's basically very simplistic technology,of how this works. 
 Now, I have this device on.,I didn't want to take my shirt off to show you, but I can tell you it's on.,This is a device that not only measures cardiac rhythm,,as you saw already,,but it also goes well beyond that.,This is me now. And you can see the ECG.,Below that's the actual heart rate and the trend;,to the right of that is a bioconductant.,That's the fluid status,,fluid status, that's really important,if you're monitoring somebody with heart failure.,And below that's temperature,,and respiration, and oxygen,,and then the position activity.,So, this is really striking, because this device,measures seven things,that are very much vital signs,for monitoring someone with heart failure. OK? 
 And why is this important? Well,,this is the most expensive bed.,What if we could reduce the need for hospital beds?,Well, we can. First of all, heart failure,is the number one reason,for hospital admissions and readmissions in this country.,The cost of heart failure is 37 billion dollars a year,,which is 80 percent related to hospitalization.,And in the course of 30 days after a hospital stay,for a Medicare greater than 65 years or older,,is -- 27 percent are readmitted in 30 days,,and by six months, over 56 percent are readmitted.,So, can we improve that? Well the idea is,we take this device that I'm wearing,,and we put it on 600 patients with heart failure,,randomly assigned, versus 600 patients,who don't have active monitoring,,and see whether we can reduce heart failure readmissions,,and that's exciting. And we'll start that trial,,and you'll hear more about how we're going to do that,,but that's a type of wireless device trial,that could change medicine in the years ahead. 
 Why now? Why has this all of a sudden become,a reality, an exciting direction in the future of medicine?,What we have is, in a way, a perfect positive storm.,This sets up consumer-driven healthcare.,That's where this is all starting.,Let me just give you specifics about why this is,a big movement if you're not aware of it:,1.2 million Americans,have gotten a Nike shoe, which is a body-area network,that connects the shoe, the sole of the shoe to the iPhone, or an iPod.,And this Wired Magazine cover article,really captured a lot of this; it talked a lot about the Nike shoe,and how quickly that's been adopted to monitor exercise physiology,and energy expenditure.,Here are some things, the principles,that are guiding principles to keep in mind:,"A data-driven health revolution,promises to make us all,better, faster, and stronger. Living by numbers.",And this one, which is really telling,,this was from July, this cover article: 
 "The personal metrics movement goes way beyond,diet and exercise. It's about tracking every facet,of life, from sleep to mood to pain,,24/7/365.",Well, I tried this device.,A lot of you have gotten that Phillips Direct Life.,I didn't have one of those,,but I got the Fitbit.,That looks like this.,It's like a wireless accelerometer, pedometer.,And I want to just give you the results of that testing,,because I wanted to understand about the consumer movement.,I hope the, by the way, the Phillips Direct Life works better --,I hope so.,But this monitors food, it monitors activity and tracks weight.,However you have to put in most of this stuff.,The only thing it really tracks by itself is activity,,and even then, it's not complete.,So, you exercise and it picks up the exercise.,You put in your height and weight, it calculates BMI,,and of course it tells you how many calories you're expending,from the exercise, and how many you took in,,if you go in and enter all the foods. 
 But it really wants you to enter all your activity.,And so I went to this,,and of course I was gratified that it picked up,the 42 minutes of exercise, elliptical exercise I did,,but then it wants more information.,So, it says, "You want to log sexual activity.,How long did you do it for?",(Laughter),And it says, "How hard was it?",(Laughter),Furthermore it says, "Start time.",Now, this doesn't appear -- this just doesn't work,,I mean, this just doesn't work. 
 So, now I want to move to sleep.,Who would ever have thought you could have your own EEG,at your home, tagged to a very nice alarm clock, by the way?,This is the headband that goes with this alarm clock.,It monitors your brainwaves continuously, when you're sleeping.,So, I did this thing for seven days,getting ready for TEDMed.,This is an important part of our life, one-third you're supposed to be sleeping. 
 Of course how many here,have any problems with sleeping?,It's usually 90 percent. So, you tell me you sleep better than expected.,Okay, well this was a week of,my life in sleeping,,and you get a Z.Q. score. Instead of an I.Q. score,,you get a Z.Q. score when you wake up.,You say, "Oh, OK." And a Z.Q. score,is adjusted to age,,and you want to get as high as you possibly can.,So this is the moment-by-moment,,or minute-by-minute sleep.,And you see that Z.Q. there was 80-odd.,And the wake time is in orange.,And this can be a problem, as I learned.,Because it not only helps you with quantifying,your sleep,,but also tells others you're awake.,So, when my wife came in and she,could tell you're awake.,"Eric, I want to talk. I want to talk.",And I'm trying to play possum.,This thing is very, very impressive. 
 OK. So, that's the first night.,And this one is now 67,,and that's not a good score.,And this tells you, of course, how much you had in REM sleep,,in deep sleep, and all this sort of thing.,This was really fascinating because,this gave that quantitation,about all the different phases of sleep.,So, it also then tells you how you do compared to your age group.,It's like a managed competition of sleep.,And really interesting stuff.,Look at this thing and say, "Well, I didn't think I was a very good sleeper,,but actually I did better than average in 50 to 60 year olds." OK?,And the key thing was, what I didn't know,,was that I was a really good dreamer. 
 OK. Now let's move from sleep to diseases.,Eighty percent of Americans have chronic disease,,or 80 percent of age greater than 65 have,two or more chronic disease,,140 million Americans,have one or more chronic disease,,and 80 percent of our 1.5, whatever, trillion,expenditures are related to chronic disease.,Now, diabetes is one of the big ones.,Almost 24 million people have diabetes.,And here is the latest map. It was published,just a little more than a week ago in the New York Times,,and it isn't looking good.,That is, for men, 29 percent,in the country over 60 have Type II diabetes,,and women, although it's less, it's terribly high. 
 But of course we have a way to measure that now,on a continuous basis,,with a sensor that detects blood glucose,,and it's important because we could detect,hyperglycemia that otherwise wouldn't be known,,and also hypoglycemia.,And you can see the red dots, in this particular patient's case,,were finger sticks, which would have missed both ends. 
 But by continuous monitoring,,it captures all that vital information.,The future of this though,,is being able to move this to a Band-Aid type phenomenon,,and that's not so far away.,So, let me just give you, very quickly,,10 top targets for wireless medicine.,All these things are possible --,some of them are very close,,or already, as you heard,,are available today, in some way or form. 
 Alzheimer's disease:,there's five million people affected, and you can check,vital signs, activity, balance.,Asthma: large number, we could detect things like,pollen count, air quality, respiratory rate. Breast cancer,,I'll show you an example of that real quickly.,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.,Depression, there's a great approach to that in mood disorders.,Diabetes I've just mentioned. Heart failure we already talked about. Hypertension:,74 million people could have continuous blood-pressure monitoring,to come up with much better management and prevention.,And obesity we already talked about, the ways to get to that.,And sleep disorders. 
 This is effective around the world. The access to smartphones,and cell phones today is extraordinary.,And this article from The Economist summed it up beautifully,about the opportunities in health across the developing world:,"Mobile phones made a bigger difference to the lives of more people,,more quickly, than any previous technology.",And that's before we got going on the m-health world.,Aging: The problem is enormous,,300,000 broken hips per year;,but the solutions are extraordinary,,and they include so many different things. 
 One of the ones I just wanted to mention:,The iShoe is another example of a sensor that,improves proprioception among the elderly,to prevent falling.,One of many different techniques using wireless sensors.,So, we can change medicine across the continuum of care,,across the ages from premies or unborn children,to seniors; the pharmaceutical arena changes;,the full spectrum of disease -- I hope I've given you a sense of that --,across the globe. 
 There are two things that can really accelerate this whole process.,One of them -- we're very fortunate -- is to develop a dedicated institute,and that's work that started with the work that Scripps with Qualcomm ...,and then the great fortune of meeting up with Gary and Mary West,,to get behind this wireless health institute.,San Diego is an extraordinary place for this.,There's over 650 wireless companies,,100 of which or more are working in wireless health.,It's the number one source of commerce, and interestingly,it dovetails beautifully with over 500 life science companies. 
 The wireless institute,,the West Wireless Health Institute,,is really the outgrowth of two extraordinary people,who are here this evening:,Gary and Mary West. And I'd like to give it up for them for getting behind this.,(Applause),Their fantastic philanthropic investment made this possible,,and this is really a nonprofit education center,which is just about to open. It looks like this,,this whole building dedicated.,And what it's trying to do is accelerate this era:,to take unmet medical needs, to work and innovate --,and we just appointed the chief engineer, Mehran Mehregany,,it was announced on Monday --,then to move up with development,,clinical trial validation and then changing medical practice,,the most challenging thing of all,,requiring attention to reimbursement, healthcare policy, healthcare economics. 
 The other big thing, besides having this fantastic,institute to catalyze this process,is guidance,,and that's of course relying on the fact that medicine goes digital.,If we understand biology from genomics and omics,and wireless through physiologic phenotyping, that's big.,Because what it does is allow a convergence like we've never had before.,Over 80 major diseases have been cracked at the genomic level,,but this is quite extraordinary: More has been learned about,the underpinnings of disease in the last two and a half years,than in the history of man.,And when you put that together with, for example,,now an app for the iPhone with your genotype,to guide drug therapy ...,but, the future -- we can now tell who's going to get Type II diabetes,from all the common variants,,and that's going to get filled in more,with low-frequency variants in the future.,We can tell who's going to get breast cancer,from the various genes.,We can also know who's likely to get atrial fibrillation. 
 And finally, another example: sudden cardiac death.,Each of these has a sensor.,We can give glucose a sensor for diabetes to prevent it.,We can prevent, or have the earliest detection possible,,for breast cancer with an ultrasound device,given to the patient.,An iPatch, iRhythm, for atrial fibrillation.,And vital-signs monitoring to prevent sudden cardiac death.,We lose 700,000 people a year in the U.S. from sudden cardiac death. 
 So, I hope I've convinced you of this,,of the impact on hospital clinic resources is profound,and then the impact on diseases is equally impressive,across all these different diseases and more.,It's really taking individualized medicine to a new height,and it's hyper-innovative,,and I think it represents the black swan of medicine.,Thanks for your attention. 
 (Applause)When my brother called me in December of 1998,,he said, "The news does not look good.",This is him on the screen.,He'd just been diagnosed with ALS,,which is a disease that the average lifespan is three years.,It paralyzes you. It starts by killing,the motor neurons in your spinal cord.,And you go from being a healthy,,robust 29-year-old male,to someone that cannot breathe,,cannot move, cannot speak. 
 This has actually been, to me, a gift,,because we began a journey,to learn a new way of thinking about life.,And even though Steven passed away three years ago,we had an amazing journey as a family.,We did not even --,I think adversity is not even the right word.,We looked at this and we said, "We're going to do something with this,in an incredibly positive way.",And I want to talk today,about one of the things that we decided to do,,which was to think about a new way of approaching healthcare.,Because, as we all know here today,,it doesn't work very well.,I want to talk about it in the context of a story. 
 This is the story of my brother.,But it's just a story. And I want to go beyond the story,,and go to something more.,"Given my status, what is the best outcome,I can hope to achieve, and how do I get there?",is what we are here to do in medicine, is what everyone should do.,And those questions all have variables to them.,All of our statuses are different.,All of our hopes and dreams, what we want to accomplish,,is different, and our paths will be different,,they are all stories. 
 But it's a story until we convert it to data,and so what we do, this concept we had,,was to take Steven's status, "What is my status?",and go from this concept of walking, breathing,,and then his hands, speak,,and ultimately happiness and function.,So, the first set of pathologies, they end up in the stick man,on his icon,,but the rest of them are really what's important here.,Because Steven, despite the fact that he was paralyzed,,as he was in that pool, he could not walk,,he could not use his arms -- that's why he had the little floaty things on them,,did you see those? --,he was happy. We were at the beach,,he was raising his son, and he was productive. 
 And we took this, and we converted it into data.,But it's not a data point at that one moment in time.,It is a data point of Steven in a context.,Here he is in the pool. But here he is healthy,,as a builder: taller, stronger,,got all the women, amazing guy.,Here he is walking down the aisle,,but he can barely walk now, so it's impaired.,And he could still hold his wife's hand, but he couldn't do buttons on his clothes,,can't feed himself.,And here he is, paralyzed completely,,unable to breathe and move, over this time journey.,These stories of his life, converted to data.,He renovated my carriage house,when he was completely paralyzed, and unable to speak,,and unable to breathe, and he won an award for a historic restoration. 
 So, here's Steven alone, sharing this story in the world.,And this is the insight, the thing that we are,excited about,,because we have gone away from the community that we are,,the fact that we really do love each other and want to care for each other.,We need to give to others to be successful.,So, Steven is sharing this story,,but he is not alone.,There are so many other people sharing their stories.,Not stories in words, but stories in data and words.,And we convert that information into this structure,,this understanding, this ability to convert,those stories into something that is computable,,to which we can begin to change the way,medicine is done and delivered. 
 We did this for ALS. We can do this for depression,,Parkinson's disease, HIV.,These are not simple, they are not internet scalable;,they require thought and processes,to find the meaningful information about the disease.,So, this is what it looks like when you go to the website.,And I'm going to show you what Patients Like Me,,the company that myself, my youngest brother,and a good friend from MIT started. 
 Here are the actual patients, there are 45,000 of them now,,sharing their stories as data.,Here is an M.S. patient.,His name is Mike, and he is uniformly impaired,on cognition, vision, walking, sensation.,Those are things that are different for each M.S. patient.,Each of them can have a different characteristic.,You can see fibromyalgia, HIV, ALS, depression.,Look at this HIV patient down here, Zinny.,It's two years of this disease. All of the symptoms are not there.,But he is working to keep his CD4 count high,and his viral level low so he can make his life better. 
 But you can aggregate this and you can discover things about treatments.,Look at this, 2,000 people almost, on Copaxone.,These are patients currently on drugs,,sharing data.,I love some of these, physical exercise, prayer.,Anyone want to run a comparative effectiveness study,on prayer against something? Let's look at prayer.,What I love about this, just sort of interesting design problems.,These are why people pray.,Here is the schedule of how frequently they -- it's a dose.,So, anyone want to see the 32 patients that pray for 60 minutes a day,,and see if they're doing better, they probably are.,Here they are. It's an open network,,everybody is sharing. We can see it all. 
 Or, I want to look at anxiety, because people are praying for anxiety.,And here is data on 15,000 people's current anxiety, right now.,How they treat it,,the drugs, the components of it,,their side effects, all of it in a rich environment,,and you can drill down and see the individuals.,This amazing data allows us to drill down and see,what this drug is for --,1,500 people on this drug, I think. Yes.,I want to talk to the 58 patients down here,who are taking four milligrams a day.,And I want to talk to the ones of those that have been doing,it for more than two years.,So, you can see the duration.,All open, all available.,I'm going to log in. 
 And this is my brother's profile.,And this is a new version of our platform we're launching right now.,This is the second generation. It's going to be in Flash.,And you can see here, as this animates over,,Steven's actual data against the background of all other patients,,against this information.,The blue band is the 50th percentile. Steven is the 75th percentile,,that he has non-genetic ALS.,You scroll down in this profile and you can see,all of his prescription drugs,,but more than that, in the new version, I can look at this interactively.,Wait, poor spinal capacity. 
 Doesn't this remind you of a great stock program?,Wouldn't it be great if the technology we used to take care of ourselves,was as good as the technology we use to make money?,Detrol. In the side effects for his drug,,integrated into that, the stem cell transplant that he had,,the first in the world, shared openly for anyone who wants to see it. 
 I love here -- the cyberkinetics implant,,which was, again, the only patient's data that was online and available.,You can adjust the time scale. You can adjust the symptoms.,You can look at the interaction between how I treat my ALS.,So, you click down on the ALS tab there.,I'm taking three drugs to manage it. Some of them are experimental.,I can look at my constipation, how to manage it.,I can see magnesium citrate, and the side effects,from that drug all integrated in the time,in which they're meaningful. 
 But I want more.,I don't want to just look at this cool device, I want to take this,data and make something even better.,I want my brother's center of the universe and his symptoms,and his drugs,,and all of the things that interact among those,,the side effects, to be in this beautiful data galaxy,that we can look at in any way we want to understand it,,so that we can take this information,and go beyond just this simple model,of what a record is. 
 I don't even know what a medical record is.,I want to solve a problem. I want an application.,So, can I take this data -- rearrange yourself,,put the symptoms in the left, the drugs across the top,,tell me everything we know about Steven and everyone else,,and what interacts.,Years after he's had these drugs,,I learned that everything he did to manage his excess saliva,,including some positive side effects that came from other drugs,,were making his constipation worse.,And if anyone's ever had severe constipation,,and you don't understand how much of an impact that has on your life --,yes, that was a pun. 
 You're trying to manage these,,and this grid is available here,,and we want to understand it.,No one's ever had this kind of information.,So, patients have this. We're for patients.,This is all about patient health care, there was no doctors on our network.,This is about the patients.,So, how can we take this and bring them a tool,that they can go back and they can engage the medical system?,And we worked hard, and we thought about it and we said,,"What's something we can use all the time,,that we can use in the medical care system,,that everyone will understand?" 
 So, the patients print it out,,because hospitals usually block us,because they believe we are a social network.,It's actually the most used feature on the website.,Doctors actually love this sheet, and they're actually really engaged.,So, we went from this story of Steven,and his history to data, and then back to paper,,where we went back and engaged the medical care system.,And here's another paper.,This is a journal, PNAS --,I think it's the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science,of the United States of America.,You've seen multiple of these today, when everyone's bragging about,the amazing things they've done.,This is a report about a drug called lithium.,Lithium, that is a drug used to treat bipolar disorder,,that a group in Italy found,slowed ALS down in 16 patients, and published it. 
 Now, we'll skip the critiques of the paper.,But the short story is: If you're a patient,,you want to be on the blue line.,You don't want to be on the red line, you want to be on the blue line.,Because the blue line is a better line. The red line,is way downhill, the blue line is a good line.,So, you know we said -- we looked at this, and what I love also,is that people always accuse these Internet sites,of promoting bad medicine and having people do things irresponsibly.,So, this is what happened when PNAS published this.,Ten percent of the people in our system took lithium.,Ten percent of the patients started taking lithium based on 16 patients of data,in a bad publication.,And they call the Internet irresponsible.,Here's the implication of what happens. 
 There's this one guy, named Humberto, from Brazil,,who unfortunately passed away nine months ago,,who said, "Hey, listen. Can you help us answer this question?,Because I don't want to wait for the next trial, it's going to be years.,I want to know now. Can you help us?",So, we launched some tools, we let them track their blood levels.,We let them share the data and exchange it.,You know, a data network.,And they said, you know, "Jamie, PLM,,can you guys tell us whether this works or not?",And we went around and we talked to people,,and they said, "You can't run a clinical trial like this. You know?,You don't have the blinding, you don't have data,,it doesn't follow the scientific method.,It's never going to work. You can't do it." 
 So, I said, "Okay well we can't do that. Then we can do something harder.",(Laughter),I can't say whether lithium works in all ALS patients,,but I can say whether it works in Humberto.,I bought a Mac about two years ago, I converted over,,and I was so excited about this new feature of the time machine,that came in Leopard. And we said -- because it's really cool,,you can go back and you can look at the entire history of your computer,,and find everything you've lost, and I loved it.,And I said, "What if we built a time machine for patients,,except instead of going backwards, we go forwards.,Can we find out what's going to happen to you,,so that you can maybe change it?" 
 So, we did. We took all the patients like Humberto,,That's the Apple background, we stole that because we didn't have time,to build our own. This is a real app by the way.,This is not just graphics.,And you take those data, and we find the patients like him, and we bring,their data together. And we bring their histories into it.,And then we say, "Well how do we line them all up?",So, we line them all up so they go together,around the meaningful points,,integrated across everything we know about the patient.,Full information, the entire course of their disease.,And that's what is going to happen to Humberto,,unless he does something.,And he took lithium, and he went down the line.,And it works almost every time. 
 Now, the ones that it doesn't work are interesting.,But almost all the time it works.,It's actually scary. It's beautiful.,So, we couldn't run a clinical trial, we couldn't figure it out.,But we could see whether it was going to work for Humberto.,And yeah, all the clinicians in the audience will talk about power,and all the standard deviation. We'll do that later.,But here is the answer,of the mean of the patients that actually decided,to take lithium.,These are all the patients that started lithium.,It's the Intent to Treat Curve.,You can see here, the blue dots on the top, the light ones,,those are the people in the study in PNAS,that you wanted to be on. And the red ones are the ones,,the pink ones on the bottom are the ones you didn't want to be.,And the ones in the middle are all of our patients,from the start of lithium at time zero,,going forward, and then going backward. 
 So, you can see we matched them perfectly, perfectly.,Terrifyingly accurate matching.,And going forward, you actually don't want to be a lithium patient this time.,You're actually doing slightly worse -- not significantly,,but slightly worse. You don't want to be a lithium patient this time.,But you know, a lot of people dropped out,,the trial, there is too much drop out.,Can we do the even harder thing? Can we go to the patients,that actually decided to stay on lithium,,because they were so convinced they were getting better? 
 We asked our control algorithm,,are those 69 patients -- by the way, you'll notice,that's four times the number of patients in the clinical trial --,can we look at those patients and say,,"Can we match them with our time machine,to the other patients that are just like them,,and what happens?",Even the ones that believed they were getting better,matched the controls exactly. Exactly.,Those little lines? That's the power. 
 So, we -- I can't tell you lithium doesn't work. I can't tell you,that if you did it at a higher dose,or if you run the study proper -- I can tell you,that for those 69 people that took lithium,,they didn't do any better than the people that were just like them,,just like me,,and that we had the power to detect that at about,a quarter of the strengths reported in the initial study.,We did that one year ahead of the time,when the first clinical trial funded by the NIH,for millions of dollars failed for futility last week,,and announced it. 
 So, remember I told you about my brother's stem cell transplant.,I never really knew whether it worked.,And I put 100 million cells in his cisterna magna,,in his lumbar cord,,and filled out the IRBs and did all this work,,and I never really knew.,How did I not know?,I mean, I didn't know what was going to happen to him.,I actually asked Tim, who is the quant in our group --,we actually searched for about a year to find someone,who could do the sort of math and statistics and modeling,in healthcare, couldn't find anybody. So, we went to the finance industry.,And there are these guys who used to model the future,of interest rates, and all that kind of stuff.,And some of them were available. So, we hired one.,(Laughter) 
 We hired them, set them up, assisting at lab.,I I.M. him things. That's the way I communicate with him,,is like a little guy in a box. I I.M.ed Tim. I said,,"Tim can you tell me whether my brother's stem cell transplant,worked or not?",And he sent me this two days ago.,It was that little outliers there. You see that guy that lived a long time?,We have to go talk to him. Because I'd like to know what happened.,Because something went different.,But my brother didn't. My brother went straight down the line.,It only works about 12 months. 
 It's the first version of the time machine.,First time we ever tried it. We'll try to get it better later,but 12 months so far.,And, you know, I look at this,,and I get really emotional.,You look at the patients, you can drill in all the controls,,you can look at them, you can ask them.,And I found a woman that had --,we found her, she was odd because she had data,after she died.,And her husband had come in and entered her last functional scores,,because he knew how much she cared.,And I am thankful. 
 I can't believe that these people,,years after my brother had died,,helped me answer the question about whether,an operation I did, and spent millions of dollars on,years ago, worked or not.,I wished it had been there,when I'd done it the first time,,and I'm really excited that it's here now,,because the lab that I founded,has some data on a drug that might work,,and I'd like to show it.,I'd like to show it in real time, now,,and I want to do that for all of the diseases that we can do that for.,I've got to thank the 45,000 people,that are doing this social experiment with us.,There is an amazing journey we are going on,to become human again,,to be part of community again,,to share of ourselves, to be vulnerable,,and it's very exciting. So, thank you.,(Applause)I'm going to speak to you today about architectural agency.,What I mean by that is that it's time for architecture,to do things again, not just represent things.,This is a construction helmet that I received two years ago,at the groundbreaking of the largest project,I, and my firm, have ever been involved in.,I was thrilled to get it. I was thrilled to be the only person,standing on the stage with a shiny silver helmet.,I thought it represented the importance of the architect. 
 I stayed thrilled until I got home,,threw the helmet onto my bed,,fell down onto my bed and realized inside,there was an inscription.,(Laughter),Now, I think that this is a great metaphor,for the state of architecture and architects today.,We are for decorative purposes only.,(Laughter) 
 Now, who do we have to blame?,We can only blame ourselves. Over the last 50 years,the design and construction industry has gotten much more complex,and has gotten much more litigious.,And we architects are cowards.,So, as we have faced liability,,we have stepped back and back,,and unfortunately, where there is liability, guess what there is:,power.,So, eventually we have found ourselves,in a totally marginalized position, way over here. 
 Now, what did we do? We're cowards,,but we're smart cowards.,And so we redefined this marginalized position as the place of architecture.,And we announced, "Hey, architecture, it's over here,,in this autonomous language,we're going to seed control of processes.",And we were going to do something that was horrible for the profession.,We actually created an artificial schism,between creation and execution,,as if you could actually create without knowing how to execute,and as if you could actually execute,without knowing how to create. 
 Now, something else happened.,And that's when we began to sell the world,that architecture was created by individuals,creating genius sketches.,And that the incredible amount of effort to deliver those sketches,for years and years and years is not only something,to be derided,,but we would merely write it off as,merely execution.,Now I'd argue that that is as absurd as stating,that 30 minutes of copulation is the creative act,,and nine months of gestation,,and, God forbid, 24 hours of child labor,is merely execution. 
 So, what do we architects need to do? We need to stitch back,creation and execution.,And we need to start authoring processes again,instead of authoring objects.,Now, if we do this, I believe we can go back 50 years,and start reinjecting agency,,social engineering, back into architecture.,Now, there are all kinds of things that we architects need to learn how to do,,like managing contracts, learning how to write contracts,,understanding procurement processes,,understanding the time value of money and cost estimation. 
 But I'm going to reduce this to the beginning of the process,,into three very pedantic statements.,The first is: Take core positions with your client.,I know it's shocking, right, that architecture would actually say that. 
 The second position is: Actually take positions.,Take joint positions with your client.,This is the moment in which you as the architect,and your client can begin to inject,vision and agency.,But it has to be done together.,And then only after this is done,are you allowed to do this, begin to put forward,architectural manifestations,that manifest those positions.,And both owner and architect alike,are empowered to critique those manifestations,based on the positions that you've taken. 
 Now, I believe that one really amazing thing will happen if you do this.,I'd like to call it the lost art of productively losing control.,You do not know what the end result is.,But I promise you, with enough brain power,and enough passion and enough commitment,,you will arrive at conclusions,that will transcend convention,,and will simply be something,that you could not have initially,or individually conceived of. 
 Alright, now I'm going to reduce all of this to a series,of simple dumb sketches.,This is the modus operandi that we have today.,We roll 120-foot Spartan,,i.e. our vision, up to our clients' gates of Troy.,And we don't understand why they won't let us in. Right?,Well, how about instead of doing that,,we roll up to the gates something they want. 
 Now this is a little bit of a dangerous metaphor,,because of course we all know that inside,of the Trojan Horse were a bunch of people with spears.,So, we can change the metaphor. Let's call the Trojan Horse,the vessel by which,you get through the gate,,get through the constraints of a project.,At which point, you and your client,have the ability to start considering what,you're going to put inside that vessel,,the agency, the vision.,And if you do that, you do that responsibly,,I believe that instead of delivering Spartans,,you can deliver maidens. 
 And if I could summarize that all up into one single sketch it would be this.,If we are so good at our craft,shouldn't we be able to conceive,of an architectural manifestation,that slides seamlessly through,the project's and the client's constraints?,Now, with that in mind, I'm going to show a project,that's very dear to many people in this room--,well, maybe not dear, but certainly close to many people in this room.,And that's a project that is just about to open next week,,the new home for the Dallas Theater Center,,the Dee and Charles Wyly Theatre. 
 Now, I'm going to present it on the same terms:,issue, position and architectural manifestation.,Now, the first issue that we faced,was that the Dallas Theater Center,had a notoriety that was beyond what you would expect,of some place outside of the triumvirate,of New York, Chicago and Seattle.,And this had to do with the ambitions of the leadership.,But it also had to do with something rather unusual,,and that was this horrible little building that they'd been performing in. 
 Why was this horrible little building,so important to their renown and their innovation?,Because they could do whatever they wanted to to this building.,When you're on Broadway, you cannot tear the proscenium down.,This building, when an artistic director,wanted to do a "Cherry Orchard" and wanted people,and wanted people to come out of a well on the stage,,they brought a backhoe in, and they simply dug the hole.,Well, that's exciting.,And you can start to get the best artistic directors,,scenic designers and actors from around the country,to come to perform here,because you can do things you can't do elsewhere. 
 So, the first position we took was,,"Hey, we as architects had better not show up,and do a pristine building,that doesn't engender the same freedoms that this,old dilapidated shed provided the company.",The second issue is a nuance of the first.,And that's that the company and the building was multiform.,That meant that they were able to perform,,as long as they had labor,they were able to go between proscenium, thrust, flat floor,,arena, traverse, you name it.,All they needed was labor. 
 Well, something happened. In fact something happened to all institutions,around the world.,It started to become hard to raise operational costs,,operational budgets.,So, they stopped having inexpensive labor.,And eventually they had to freeze their organization,into something called a bastardized thruscenium. 
 So, the second position we took is that the freedoms that we provided,,the ability to move between stage configurations,,had better be able to be done,without relying on operational costs. Alright? Affordably.,The architectural manifestation,was frankly just dumb.,It was to take all the things that are known as front of house and back of house,and redefine them as above house and below house. 
 At first blush you think, "Hey it's crazy,,what could you possibly gain?",We created what we like to call superfly.,(Laughter),Now, superfly, the concept is,you take all the freedoms you normally associate with the flytower,,and you smear them across flytower and auditorium.,Suddenly the artistic director,can move between different stage,and audience configurations.,And because that flytower has the ability to pick up,all the pristine elements, suddenly the rest of the environment,can be provisional. And you can drill, cut, nail, screw,paint and replace,,with a minimum of cost. 
 But there was a third advantage that we got by doing this move,that was unexpected.,And that was that it freed up the perimeter of the auditorium,in a most unusual way.,And that provided the artistic director suddenly,the ability to define suspension of disbelief.,So, the building affords artistic directors the freedom,to conceive of almost any kind of activity,underneath this floating object.,But also to challenge the notion of suspension of disbelief,such that in the last act of Macbeth,,if he or she wants you to associate,the parable that you're seeing with Dallas, with your real life,,he or she can do so. 
 Now, in order to do this we and the clients,had to do something fairly remarkable.,In fact it really was the clients who had to do it.,They had to make a decision, based on the positions we took,to redefine the budget being from two thirds capital-A architecture,and one-third infrastructure,,to actually the inverse,,two-thirds infrastructure and one-third capital-A architecture.,That's a lot for a client to commit to,before you actually see the fruition of the concept.,But based on the positions,,they took the educated leap of faith to do so.,And effectively we created what we like to call,a theater machine. 
 Now, that theater machine has ability,to move between a whole series of configurations,at the push of a button and a few stagehands,in a short amount of time.,But it also has the potential,to not only provide multiform but multi-processional sequences.,Meaning: The artistic director,doesn't necessarily need to go through our lobby. 
 One of the things that we learned when we visited various theaters,is they hate us architects,,because they say the first thing they have to do,,the first five minutes of any show,,is they have to get our architecture,out of the mind of their patron.,Well now there are potentials of this building,to allow the artistic director,to actually move into the building,without using our architecture.,So, in fact, there is the building, there is what we call the draw.,You're going down into our lobby,,go through the lobby with our own little dangly bits, whether you like them or not,,up through the stair that leads you into the auditorium. 
 But there is also the potential,to allow people to move directly from the outside,,in this case suggesting kind of Wagnerian entrance,,into the interior of the auditorium.,And here is the fruition of that in actuality.,These are the two large pivoting doors,that allow people to move directly from the outside, in,or from the inside, out,,performers or audience alike. 
 Now, imagine what that could be. I have to say honestly,this is not something yet the building can do because it takes too long.,But imagine the freedoms,if you could take this further, that in fact you could consider,a Wagnerian entry,,a first act in thrust,,an intermission in Greek, a second act in arena,,and you leave through our lobby with dangly bits.,Now that, I would say, is architecture performing.,It is taking the hand of the architect,to actually remove the hand of the architect,in favor of the hand of the artistic director. 
 I'll go through the three basic configurations.,This is the flat floor configuration.,You notice that there is no proscenium,,the balconies have been raised up, there are no seats,,the floor in the auditorium is flat. 
 The first configuration is easy to understand.,The balconies come down, you see that the orchestra,begins to have a rake that's frontal towards the end stage,,and the seats come in. 
 The third configuration is a little harder to understand.,Here you see that the balconies actually have to move out of the way,in order to bring a thrust into the space.,And some of the seats need to actually change their direction,,and change their rake, to allow that to happen. 
 I'll do it again so you can see it.,There you see it's the side balconies for the proscenium.,And there it is in the thrust configuration. 
 In order to do that,,again, we needed a client who was willing to take educational risks.,And they told us one important thing:,"You shall not beta-test.",Meaning, nothing that we do,can we be the first ones to do it.,But they were willing for us to apply technologies,from other areas that already had failsafe mechanisms to this building. 
 And the solution in terms of the balconies,was to use something that we all know as a scoreboard lift.,Now, if you were to take a scoreboard,and drop it on dirt and whiskey,,that would be bad.,If you were not able to take the scoreboard out of the arena,and be able to do the Ice Capades the next night,,that would also be bad.,And so this technology already had all the failsafe mechanisms,and allowed the theater and our client,to actually do this with confidence,that they would be able to change over their configurations at will. 
 The second technology that we applied,was actually using things that you know from,the stage side of an opera house.,In this case what we're doing is we're taking,the orchestra floor, lifting it up, spinning it,,changing the rake, taking it back to flat floor,,changing the rake again. In essence, you can begin to define,rakes and viewing angles,of people in the orchestra seating, at will. 
 Here you see the chairs being spun around to go from proscenium or end stage,to thrust configuration.,The proscenium, also. As far as we know this is the first building in the world,in which the proscenium can entirely fly out of the space.,Here you see the various acoustic baffles as well as,the flying mechanisms and catwalks over the auditorium.,And ultimately, up in the flytower,,the scene sets that allow the transformations to occur. 
 As I said, all that was in service of creating a flexible,yet affordable configuration.,But we got this other benefit, and that was,the ability of the perimeter to suddenly engage,Dallas on the outside.,Here you see the building in its current state,with blinds closed. This is a trompe l'oeil.,Actually this is not a curtain. These are vinyl blinds,that are integrated into the windows themselves,,again with failsafe mechanisms,that can be lifted such that you can completely demystify,,if you chose, the operations of the theater,going on behind, rehearsals and so forth.,But you also have the ability,to allow the audience to see Dallas,,to perform with Dallas as the backdrop of your performance. 
 Now, if I'll take you through --,this is an early concept sketch --,take you through kind of a mixture of all these things together.,Effectively you would have something like this.,You would be allowed to bring objects or performers into the performing chamber:,"Aida," their elephants, you can bring the elephants in.,You would be able to expose the auditorium to Dallas,or vice versa, Dallas to the auditorium.,You'd be able to open portions in order to,change the procession,,allow people to come in and out for an intermission,,or to enter for the beginning or the end of a performance. 
 As I said, all the balconies can move,,but they can also be disappeared completely.,The proscenium can fly.,You can bring large objects into the chamber itself.,But most convincingly when we had to confront the idea,of changing costs from architecture to infrastructure,,is something that is represented by this.,And again, this is not all the flexibilities of the building that is actually built,,but at least suggests the ideas. 
 This building has the ability, in short order,,to go back to a flat floor organization,such that they can rent it out.,Now, if there is anyone here from American Airlines,,please consider doing your Christmas party here.,(Laughter),That allows the company to raise operational budgets,without having to compete with other venues,with much larger auditoriums.,That's an enormous benefit. 
 So, the theater company has the ability,to do totally hermetic,,light-controlled, sound-controlled, great acoustics,,great intimacy Shakespeare,,but can also do Beckett,with the skyline of Dallas sitting behind it.,Here it is in a flat floor configuration.,The theater has been going through its kind of paces. 
 Here it is in an end stage configuration.,It's actually beautiful. There was a rock band.,We stood outside trying to see if the acoustics worked,,and you could see the guys doing this but you couldn't hear them.,It was very unusual.,Here it is in a thrust configuration.,And last but not least,,you see this already has the ability to create events,in order to generate operational budgets,to overcome the building in fact performing,to allow the company to overcome their biggest problem. 
 I'm going to show you a brief time lapse.,As I said, this can be done with only two people,,and with a minimum amount of time.,This is the first time that actually the changeover was done,and so there is literally thousands of people because,everyone was excited and wanted to be a part of it.,So, in a way try to disregard all the thousands of ants running around.,And think of it being done with just a few people.,Again, just a couple people are required.,(Laughter),I promise.,Et voila.,(Applause) 
 So, just in conclusion, a few shots.,This is the AT&T Performing Arts Center's,Dee and Charles Wyly Theater.,There it is at night.,And last but not least the entire AT&T Performing Arts Center.,You can see the Winspear Opera House on the right,and the Dee and Charles Wyly Theater on the left. 
 And to remind you that here is an example in which,architecture actually did something.,But we got to that conclusion,without understanding where we were going,,what we knew were a series of issues that the company,and the client was confronted with.,And we took positions with them, and it was through those positions,that we began to take architectural manifestations,and we arrived at a conclusion that none of us,,really none of us could ever,have conceived of initially or individually.,Thank you.,(Applause)OK. We've heard a lot of people,speak at this conference,about the power of the human mind.,And what I'd like to do today,is give you a vivid example,of how that power can be unleashed,when someone is in a survival situation,,how the will to survive can bring that out in people.,This is an incident which occurred on Mount Everest;,it was the worst disaster in the history of Everest.,And when it occurred, I was the only doctor on the mountain.,So I'll take you through that,and we'll see what it's like,when someone really,summons the will to survive. 
 OK, this is Mount Everest.,It's 29,035 feet high.,I've been there six times: Four times I did work with National Geographic,,making tectonic plate measurements;,twice, I went with NASA,doing remote sensing devices.,It was on my fourth trip to Everest,that a comet passed over the mountain. Hyakutake.,And the Sherpas told us then,that was a very bad omen,,and we should have listened to them.,Everest is an extreme environment.,There's only one-third as much oxygen at the summit as there is at sea level.,Near the summit, temperatures,can be 40 degrees below zero.,You can have winds 20 to 40 miles an hour.,It's actually a wind-chill factor,which is lower than a summer day on Mars.,I remember one time being up near the summit,,I reached into my down jacket,for a drink from my water bottle,,inside my down jacket,,only to discover that the water was already frozen solid.,That gives you an idea of just how severe,things are near the summit. 
 OK, this is the route up Everest.,It starts at base camp, at 17,500 feet.,Camp One, 2,000 feet higher.,Camp Two, another 2,000 feet higher up,,what's called the Western Cwm.,CampThree is at the base of Lhotse,,which is the fourth highest mountain in the world, but it's dwarfed by Everest.,And then Camp Four is the highest camp;,that's 3,000 feet short of the summit.,This is a view of base camp.,This is pitched on a glacier at 17,500 feet.,It's the highest point you can bring your yaks,before you have to unload.,And this is what they unloaded for me:,I had four yak loads of medical supplies,,which are dumped in a tent,,and here I am trying to arrange things. 
 This was our expedition.,It was a National Geographic expedition,,but it was organized by The Explorers Club.,There were three other expeditions on the mountain,,an American team, a New Zealand team,and an IMAX team.,And, after actually two months of preparation,,we built our camps all the way up the mountain. 
 This is a view looking up the icefall,,the first 2,000 feet of the climb,up from base camp.,And here's a picture in the icefall;,it's a waterfall, but it's frozen, but it moves very slowly,,and it actually changes every day.,When you're in it, you're like a rat in a maze;,you can't even see over the top.,This is near the top of the icefall.,You want to climb through at night when the ice is frozen.,That way, it's less likely to tumble down on you.,These are some climbers reaching the top of the icefall just at sun-up.,This is me crossing a crevasse.,We cross on aluminum ladders with safety ropes attached.,That's another crevasse.,Some of these things are 10 stories deep or more,,and one of my climbing friends says that,the reason we actually climb at night,is because if we ever saw the bottom,of what we're climbing over,,we would never do it. 
 Okay. This is Camp One.,It's the first flat spot you can reach,after you get up to the top of the icefall.,And from there we climb up to Camp Two,,which is sort of the foreground.,These are climbers moving up the Lhotse face,,that mountain toward Camp Three.,They're on fixed ropes here.,A fall here, if you weren't roped in,,would be 5,000 feet down.,This is a view taken from camp three.,You can see the Lhotse face is in profile,,it's about a 45 degree angle. It takes two days to climb it,,so you put the camp halfway through. 
 If you notice, the summit of Everest is black.,There's no ice over it.,And that's because Everest is so high,,it's in the jet stream,,and winds are constantly scouring the face,,so no snow gets to accumulate.,What looks like a cloud behind the summit ridge,is actually snow being blown off the summit. 
 This is on the way up from Camp Three to Camp Four,,moving in, up through the clouds.,And this is at Camp Four.,Once you get to Camp Four, you have maybe 24 hours,to decide if you're going to go for the summit or not.,Everybody's on oxygen, your supplies are limited,,and you either have to go up or go down,,make that decision very quickly.,This is a picture of Rob Hall.,He was the leader of the New Zealand team.,This is a radio he used later to call his wife,that I'll tell you about.,These are some climbers waiting to go to the summit.,They're up at Camp Four, and you can see that there's wind blowing off the summit.,This is not good weather to climb in,,so the climbers are just waiting, hoping that the wind's going to die down.,And, in fact, the wind does die down at night.,It becomes very calm, there's no wind at all.,This looks like a good chance to go for the summit.,So here are some climbers starting out for the summit,on what's called the Triangular Face.,It's the first part of climb.,It's done in the dark, because it's actually less steep than what comes next,,and you can gain daylight hours if you do this in the dark. 
 So that's what happened.,The climbers got on the southeast ridge.,This is the view looking at the southeast ridge.,The summit would be in the foreground.,From here, it's about 1,500 feet,up at a 30-degree angle to the summit.,But what happened that year was,the wind suddenly and unexpectedly picked up.,A storm blew in that no one was anticipating.,You can see here some ferocious winds,blowing snow way high off the summit.,And there were climbers on that summit ridge. 
 This is a picture of me in that area,taken a year before,,and you can see I've got an oxygen mask on,with a rebreather.,I have an oxygen hose connected here.,You can see on this climber, we have two oxygen tanks in the backpack --,little titanium tanks, very lightweight --,and we're not carrying much else.,This is all you've got. You're very exposed on the summit ridge. 
 OK, this is a view taken on the summit ridge itself.,This is on the way toward the summit,,on that 1,500-foot bridge.,All the climbers here are climbing unroped,,and the reason is because,the drop off is so sheer on either side,that if you were roped to somebody,,you'd wind up just pulling them off with you.,So each person climbs individually.,And it's not a straight path at all,,it's very difficult climbing,,and there's always the risk,of falling on either side.,If you fall to your left, you're going to fall,8,000 feet into Nepal;,if you fall to your right,,you're going to fall 12,000 feet into Tibet.,So it's probably better to fall into Tibet,because you'll live longer.,(Laughter),But, either way, you fall for the rest of your life. 
 OK. Those climbers were up near the summit,,along that summit ridge that you see up there,,and I was down here in Camp Three.,My expedition was down in Camp Three,,while these guys were up there in the storm.,The storm was so fierce that we had to lay,,fully dressed, fully equipped,,laid out on the tent floor,to stop the tent from blowing off the mountain.,It was the worst winds I've ever seen.,And the climbers up on the ridge,were that much higher, 2,000 feet higher,,and completely exposed to the elements.,We were in radio contact with some of them. 
 This is a view taken along the summit ridge.,Rob Hall, we heard by radio,,was up here, at this point in the storm,with Doug Hansen.,And we heard that Rob was OK,,but Doug was too weak to come down.,He was exhausted, and Rob was staying with him.,We also got some bad news in the storm,that Beck Weathers, another climber,,had collapsed in the snow and was dead.,There were still 18 other climbers,that we weren't aware of their condition.,They were lost. There was total confusion on the mountain;,all the stories were confusing, most of them were conflicting.,We really had no idea what was going on during that storm.,We were just hunkered down,in our tents at Camp Three. 
 Our two strongest climbers, Todd Burleson and Pete Athans,,decided to go up to try to rescue who they could,even though there was a ferocious storm going.,They tried to radio a message to Rob Hall,,who was a superb climber,stuck, sort of, with a weak climber,up near the summit.,I expected them to say to Rob,,"Hold on. We're coming.",But in fact, what they said was,,"Leave Doug and come down yourself.,There's no chance of saving him,,and just try to save yourself at this point.",And Rob got that message,,but his answer was,,"We're both listening.",Todd and Pete got up to the summit ridge, up in here,,and it was a scene of complete chaos up there.,But they did what they could to stabilize the people.,I gave them radio advice from Camp Three,,and we sent down the climbers that could make it down,under their own power.,The ones that couldn't we just sort of decided to leave up at Camp Four.,So the climbers were coming down along this route. 
 This is taken from Camp Three, where I was.,And they all came by me,so I could take a look at them and see what I could do for them,,which is really not much, because Camp Three,is a little notch cut in the ice,in the middle of a 45-degree angle.,You can barely stand outside the tent.,It's really cold; it's 24,000 feet.,The only supplies I had at that altitude,were two plastic bags,with preloaded syringes,of painkiller and steroids. 
 So, as the climbers came by me,,I sort of assessed whether or not they were in condition,to continue on further down.,The ones that weren't that lucid or were not that well coordinated,,I would give an injection of steroids,to try to give them some period,of lucidity and coordination,where they could then work their way further down the mountain.,It's so awkward to work up there that sometimes,I even gave the injections right through their clothes.,It was just too hard to maneuver,any other way up there. 
 While I was taking care of them,,we got more news about Rob Hall.,There was no way we could get up high enough to rescue him.,He called in to say that he was alone now.,Apparently, Doug had died higher up on the mountain.,But Rob was now too weak to come down himself,,and with the fierce winds and up at that altitude,,he was just beyond rescue,and he knew it.,At that point, he asked,to be paged into his wife.,He was carrying a radio.,His wife was home in New Zealand,,seven months pregnant with their first child,,and Rob asked to be patched into her. That was done,,and Rob and his wife,had their last conversation.,They picked the name for their baby.,Rob then signed off,,and that was the last we ever heard of him. 
 I was faced with treating a lot of critically ill patients,at 24,000 feet,,which was an impossibility.,So what we did was, we got the victims,down to 21,000 feet, where it was easier for me to treat them.,This was my medical kit.,It's a tackle box filled with medical supplies.,This is what I carried up the mountain.,I had more supplies lower down,,which I asked to be brought up to meet me at the lower camp.,And this was scene at the lower camp. 
 The survivors came in one by one.,Some of them were hypothermic,,some of them were frostbitten, some were both.,What we did was try to warm them up as best we could,,put oxygen on them and try to revive them,,which is difficult to do at 21,000 feet,,when the tent is freezing.,This is some severe frostbite on the feet,,severe frostbite on the nose.,This climber was snow blind. 
 As I was taking care of these climbers,,we got a startling experience.,Out of nowhere, Beck Weathers,,who we had already been told was dead,,stumbled into the tent,,just like a mummy, he walked into the tent.,I expected him to be incoherent,,but, in fact, he walked into the tent and said to me,,"Hi, Ken. Where should I sit?",And then he said,,"Do you accept my health insurance?",(Laughter),He really said that.,(Laughter),So he was completely lucid, but he was very severely frostbitten.,You can see his hand is completely white;,his face, his nose, is burned.,First, it turns white, and then when it's completed necrosis,,it turns black, and then it falls off.,It's the last stage, just like a scar. 
 So, as I was taking care of Beck,,he related what had been going on up there.,He said he had gotten lost in the storm,,collapsed in the snow,,and just laid there, unable to move.,Some climbers had come by and looked at him,,and he heard them say, "He's dead.",But Beck wasn't dead; he heard that,,but he was completely unable to move.,He was in some sort of catatonic state,where he could be aware of his surroundings,,but couldn't even blink to indicate that he was alive.,So the climbers passed him by,,and Beck lay there for a day, a night,and another day,,in the snow.,And then he said to himself,,"I don't want to die.,I have a family to come back to.",And the thoughts of his family,,his kids and his wife,,generated enough energy,,enough motivation in him,,so that he actually got up.,After laying in the snow that long a time,,he got up and found his way back to the camp.,And Beck told me that story very quietly,,but I was absolutely stunned by it.,I couldn't imagine anybody laying in the snow,that long a time,and then getting up.,He apparently reversed,an irreversible hypothermia.,And I can only try to speculate,on how he did it. 
 So, what if we had Beck,hooked up to a SPECT scan,,something that could actually measure brain function?,Just very simply, the three parts of the brain:,the frontal lobe, where you focus,your attention and concentration;,you have the temporal lobe,,where you form images and keep memories;,and the posterior part of your brain,,which contains the cerebellum, which controls motion;,and the brain stem,,where you have your basic maintenance functions,,like heartbeat and respiration. 
 So let's take a cut through the brain here,,and imagine that Beck,was hooked up to a SPECT scan.,This measures dynamic blood flow,and therefore energy flow within the brain.,So you have the prefrontal cortex here,,lighting up in red.,This is a pretty evenly distributed scan.,You have the middle area,,where the temporal lobe might be, in here,,and the posterior portion, where the maintenance functions are in the back. 
 This is a roughly normal scan,,showing equal distribution of energy.,Now, you go to this one and you see how much more,the frontal lobes are lighting up.,This might be what Beck would be experiencing,when he realizes he's in danger.,He's focusing all his attention,on getting himself out of trouble.,These parts of the brain are quieting down.,He's not thinking about his family or anybody else at this point,,and he's working pretty hard.,He's trying to get his muscles going and get out of this.,OK, but he's losing ground here.,He's running out of energy.,It's too cold; he can't keep his metabolic fires going,,and, you see, there's no more red here;,his brain is quieting down.,He's collapsed in the snow here. Everything is quiet,,there's very little red anywhere.,Beck is powering down.,He's dying. 
 You go on to the next scan,,but, in Beck's case,,you can see that the middle part of his brain,is beginning to light up again.,He's beginning to think about his family.,He's beginning to have images,that are motivating him to get up.,He's developing energy in this area,through thought.,And this is how he's going to turn thought,back into action.,This part of the brain is called the anterior cingulate gyrus.,It's an area in which,a lot of neuroscientists believe,the seat of will exists.,This is where people make decisions, where they develop willpower.,And, you can see, there's an energy flow,going from the mid portion of his brain,,where he's got images of his family,,into this area, which is powering his will. 
 Okay. This is getting stronger and stronger,to the point where it's actually,going to be a motivating factor.,He's going to develop enough energy in that area --,after a day, a night and a day --,to actually motivate himself to get up.,And you can see here,,he's starting to get more energy into the frontal lobe.,He's beginning to focus, he can concentrate now.,He's thinking about what he's got to do to save himself.,So this energy has been transmitted,up toward the front of his brain,,and it's getting quieter down here,,but he's using this energy,to think about what he has to do to get himself going.,And then, that energy is sort of spreading,throughout his thought areas.,He's not thinking about his family now, and he's getting himself motivated.,This is the posterior part, where his muscles are going to be moving,,and he's going to be pacing himself.,His heart and lungs are going to pick up speed.,So this is what I can speculate might have been going on,had we been able to do a SPECT scan on Beck,during this survival epic. 
 So here I am taking care of Beck at 21,000 feet,,and I felt what I was doing was completely trivial,compared to what he had done for himself.,It just shows you what the power of the mind can do.,He was critically ill, there were other critically ill patients;,luckily, we were able to get a helicopter,in to rescue these guys.,A helicopter came in at 21,000 feet,and carried out the highest helicopter rescue in history.,It was able to land on the ice, take away Beck,and the other survivors, one by one,,and get them off to Kathmandu in a clinic,before we even got back to base camp. 
 This is a scene at base camp,,at one of the camps,where some of the climbers were lost.,And we had a memorial service there,a few days later.,These are Serphas lighting juniper branches.,They believe juniper smoke is holy.,And the climbers stood around on the high rocks,and spoke of the climbers who were lost,up near the summit,,turning to the mountain, actually, to talk to them directly.,There were five climbers lost here.,This was Scott Fischer,,Rob Hall,,Andy Harris,,Doug Hansen,and Yasuko Namba.,And one more climber,should have died that day, but didn't,,and that's Beck Weathers.,He was able to survive,because he was able to generate that incredible willpower,,he was able to use all the power of his mind,to save himself. 
 These are Tibetan prayer flags.,These Sherpas believe that,if you write prayers on these flags,,the message will be carried up to the gods,,and that year, Beck's message was answered. 
 Thank you.,(Applause)I'm speaking about compassion from an Islamic point of view,,and perhaps my faith is not very well thought of,as being one that is grounded in compassion.,The truth of the matter is otherwise. 
 Our holy book, the Koran, consists of 114 chapters,,and each chapter begins with what we call the basmala,,the saying of "In the name of God, the all compassionate, the all merciful,",or, as Sir Richard Burton --,not the Richard Burton who was married to Elizabeth Taylor,,but the Sir Richard Burton who lived a century before that,and who was a worldwide traveler,and translator of many works of literature --,translates it. "In the name of God, the compassionating, the compassionate." 
 And in a saying of the Koran, which to Muslims is God speaking to humanity,,God says to his prophet Muhammad --,whom we believe to be the last of a series of prophets,,beginning with Adam, including Noah, including Moses, including Abraham,,including Jesus Christ, and ending with Muhammad --,that, "We have not sent you, O Muhammad,,except as a 'rahmah,' except as a source of compassion to humanity." 
 For us human beings, and certainly for us as Muslims,,whose mission, and whose purpose in following the path of the prophet,is to make ourselves as much like the prophet.,And the prophet, in one of his sayings, said,,"Adorn yourselves with the attributes of God.",And because God Himself said that the primary attribute of his is compassion --,in fact, the Koran says that "God decreed upon himself compassion,",or, "reigned himself in by compassion" --,therefore, our objective and our mission must be to be sources of compassion,,activators of compassion, actors of compassion,and speakers of compassion and doers of compassion. 
 That is all well and good,,but where do we go wrong,,and what is the source of the lack of compassion in the world?,For the answer to this, we turn to our spiritual path.,In every religious tradition, there is the outer path and the inner path,,or the exoteric path and the esoteric path.,The esoteric path of Islam is more popularly known as Sufism, or "tasawwuf" in Arabic.,And these doctors or these masters,,these spiritual masters of the Sufi tradition,,refer to teachings and examples of our prophet,that teach us where the source of our problems lies. 
 In one of the battles that the prophet waged,,he told his followers, "We are returning from the lesser war,to the greater war, to the greater battle." 
 And they said, "Messenger of God, we are battle-weary.,How can we go to a greater battle?" 
 He said, "That is the battle of the self, the battle of the ego.",The sources of human problems have to do with egotism, "I." 
 The famous Sufi master Rumi, who is very well known to most of you,,has a story in which he talks of a man who goes to the house of a friend,,and he knocks on the door,,and a voice answers, "Who's there?" 
 "It's me," or, more grammatically correctly, "It is I,",as we might say in English. 
 The voice says, "Go away." 
 After many years of training, of disciplining, of search and struggle,,he comes back.,With much greater humility, he knocks again on the door. 
 The voice asks, "Who is there?" 
 He said, "It is you, O heartbreaker." 
 The door swings open, and the voice says,,"Come in, for there is no room in this house for two I's,",-- two capital I's, not these eyes -- "for two egos." 
 And Rumi's stories are metaphors for the spiritual path.,In the presence of God, there is no room for more than one "I,",and that is the "I" of divinity.,In a teaching -- called a "hadith qudsi" in our tradition --,God says that, "My servant," or "My creature, my human creature,,does not approach me by anything that is dearer to me,than what I have asked them to do.",And those of you who are employers know exactly what I mean.,You want your employees to do what you ask them to do,,and if they've done that, then they can do extra.,But don't ignore what you've asked them to do. 
 "And," God says, "my servant continues to get nearer to me,,by doing more of what I've asked them to do" --,extra credit, we might call it --,"until I love him or love her.,And when I love my servant," God says,,"I become the eyes by which he or she sees,,the ears by which he or she listens,,the hand by which he or she grasps,,and the foot by which he or she walks,,and the heart by which he or she understands.",It is this merging of our self with divinity,that is the lesson and purpose of our spiritual path and all of our faith traditions. 
 Muslims regard Jesus as the master of Sufism,,the greatest prophet and messenger who came to emphasize the spiritual path.,When he says, "I am the spirit, and I am the way,",and when the prophet Muhammad said, "Whoever has seen me has seen God,",it is because they became so much an instrument of God,,they became part of God's team --,so that God's will was manifest through them,,and they were not acting from their own selves and their own egos.,Compassion on earth is given, it is in us.,All we have to do is to get our egos out of the way,,get our egotism out of the way. 
 I'm sure, probably all of you here, or certainly the very vast majority of you,,have had what you might call a spiritual experience,,a moment in your lives when, for a few seconds, a minute perhaps,,the boundaries of your ego dissolved.,And at that minute, you felt at one with the universe --,one with that jug of water, one with every human being,,one with the Creator --,and you felt you were in the presence of power, of awe,,of the deepest love, the deepest sense of compassion and mercy,that you have ever experienced in your lives. 
 That is a moment which is a gift of God to us --,a gift when, for a moment, he lifts that boundary,which makes us insist on "I, I, I, me, me, me,",and instead, like the person in Rumi's story,,we say, "Oh, this is all you.,This is all you. And this is all us.,And us, and I, and us are all part of you.,O, Creator! O, the Objective! The source of our being,and the end of our journey,,you are also the breaker of our hearts.,You are the one whom we should all be towards, for whose purpose we live,,and for whose purpose we shall die,,and for whose purpose we shall be resurrected again,to account to God to what extent we have been compassionate beings." 
 Our message today, and our purpose today,,and those of you who are here today,,and the purpose of this charter of compassion, is to remind.,For the Koran always urges us to remember, to remind each other,,because the knowledge of truth is within every human being. 
 We know it all.,We have access to it all.,Jung may have called it "the subconscious.",Through our subconscious, in your dreams --,the Koran calls our state of sleep "the lesser death,","the temporary death" --,in our state of sleep we have dreams, we have visions,,we travel even outside of our bodies, for many of us,,and we see wonderful things.,We travel beyond the limitations of space as we know it,,and beyond the limitations of time as we know it.,But all this is for us to glorify the name of the creator,whose primary name is the compassionating, the compassionate. 
 God, Bokh, whatever name you want to call him with, Allah, Ram, Om,,whatever the name might be through which you name,or access the presence of divinity,,it is the locus of absolute being,,absolute love and mercy and compassion,,and absolute knowledge and wisdom,,what Hindus call "satchidananda.",The language differs,,but the objective is the same. 
 Rumi has another story,about three men, a Turk, an Arab and --,and I forget the third person, but for my sake, it could be a Malay.,One is asking for angur -- one is, say, an Englishman --,one is asking for eneb, and one is asking for grapes.,And they have a fight and an argument because,-- "I want grapes." "I want eneb. "I want angur." --,not knowing that the word that they're using,refers to the same reality in different languages. 
 There's only one absolute reality by definition,,one absolute being by definition,,because absolute is, by definition, single,,and absolute and singular.,There's this absolute concentration of being,,the absolute concentration of consciousness,,awareness, an absolute locus of compassion and love,that defines the primary attributes of divinity. 
 And these should also be,the primary attributes of what it means to be human.,For what defines humanity, perhaps biologically,,is our physiology,,but God defines humanity by our spirituality, by our nature. 
 And the Koran says, He speaks to the angels and says,,"When I have finished the formation of Adam from clay,,and breathed into him of my spirit,,then, fall in prostration to him.",The angels prostrate, not before the human body,,but before the human soul.,Why? Because the soul, the human soul,,embodies a piece of the divine breath,,a piece of the divine soul. 
 This is also expressed in biblical vocabulary,when we are taught that we were created in the divine image.,What is the imagery of God?,The imagery of God is absolute being,,absolute awareness and knowledge and wisdom,and absolute compassion and love. 
 And therefore, for us to be human --,in the greatest sense of what it means to be human,,in the most joyful sense of what it means to be human --,means that we too have to be proper stewards,of the breath of divinity within us,,and seek to perfect within ourselves the attribute of being,,of being alive, of beingness;,the attribute of wisdom, of consciousness, of awareness;,and the attribute of being compassionate and loving beings. 
 This is what I understand from my faith tradition,,and this is what I understand from my studies of other faith traditions,,and this is the common platform on which we must all stand,,and when we stand on this platform as such,,I am convinced that we can make a wonderful world. 
 And I believe, personally, that we're on the verge,and that, with the presence and help of people like you here,,we can bring about the prophecy of Isaiah.,For he foretold of a period,when people shall transform their swords into plowshares,and will not learn war or make war anymore. 
 We have reached a stage in human history that we have no option:,we must, we must lower our egos,,control our egos -- whether it is individual ego, personal ego,,family ego, national ego --,and let all be for the glorification of the one. 
 Thank you, and God bless you.,(Applause)I'm going to talk about compassion and the golden rule,from a secular perspective and even from a kind of scientific perspective.,I'm going to try to give you a little bit of a natural history,of compassion and the golden rule.,So, I'm going to be sometimes using kind of clinical language,,and so it's not going to sound as warm and fuzzy,as your average compassion talk.,I want to warn you about that. 
 So, I do want to say, at the outset, that I think compassion's great.,The golden rule is great. I'm a big supporter of both.,And I think it's great that,the leaders of the religions of the world,are affirming compassion and the golden rule as fundamental principles,that are integral to their faiths. 
 At the same time, I think religions don't deserve all the credit.,I think nature gave them a helping hand here.,I'm going to argue tonight that compassion and the golden rule,are, in a certain sense, built into human nature.,But I'm also going to argue,that once you understand the sense in which they are built into human nature,,you realize that just affirming compassion,,and affirming the golden rule, is really not enough.,There's a lot of work to be done after that. 
 OK so, a quick natural history, first of compassion.,In the beginning, there was compassion,,and I mean not just when human beings first showed up,,but actually even before that.,I think it's probably the case that, in the human evolutionary lineage,,even before there were homo sapiens,,feelings like compassion and love and sympathy,had earned their way into the gene pool,,and biologists have a pretty clear idea of how this first happened. 
 It happened through a principle known as kin selection.,And the basic idea of kin selection is that,,if an animal feels compassion for a close relative,,and this compassion leads the animal to help the relative,,then, in the end, the compassion actually winds up helping the genes,underlying the compassion itself.,So, from a biologist's point of view, compassion is actually,a gene's way of helping itself. OK. 
 I warned you this was not going to be very warm and fuzzy.,I'll get there -- I hope to get a little fuzzier.,This doesn't bother me so much,,that the underlying Darwinian rationale of compassion,is kind of self-serving at the genetic level.,Actually, I think the bad news about kin selection,is just that it means that this kind of compassion,is naturally deployed only within the family.,That's the bad news. The good news is compassion is natural.,The bad news is that this kin selected compassion,is naturally confined to the family. 
 Now, there's more good news that came along later in evolution,,a second kind of evolutionary logic.,Biologists call that "reciprocal altruism." OK.,And there, the basic idea is that,compassion leads you to do good things for people who then will return the favor.,Again, I know this is not as inspiring a notion of compassion,as you may have heard in the past,,but from a biologist's point of view, this reciprocal altruism kind of compassion,is ultimately self-serving too.,It's not that people think that, when they feel the compassion.,It's not consciously self-serving, but to a biologist, that's the logic.,And so, you wind up most easily extending compassion to friends and allies. 
 I'm sure a lot of you, if a close friend has something really terrible happen to them,,you feel really bad.,But if you read in the newspaper,that something really horrible happened to somebody you've never heard of,,you can probably live with that.,That's just human nature.,So, it's another good news/bad news story.,It's good that compassion was extended beyond the family,by this kind of evolutionary logic.,The bad news is this doesn't bring us universal compassion by itself.,So, there's still work to be done. 
 Now, there's one other result of this dynamic called reciprocal altruism,,which I think is kind of good news,,which is that the way that this is played out in the human species,,it has given people an intuitive appreciation of the golden rule.,I don't quite mean that the golden rule itself is written in our genes,,but you can go to a hunter gatherer society,that has had no exposure to any of the great religious traditions,,no exposure to ethical philosophy,,and you'll find, if you spend time with these people,,that, basically, they believe that one good turn deserves another,,and that bad deeds should be punished.,And evolutionary psychologists think that these intuitions have a basis in the genes.,So, they do understand that if you want to be treated well,,you treat other people well.,And it's good to treat other people well.,That's close to being a kind of built-in intuition. 
 So, that's good news. Now, if you've been paying attention,,you're probably anticipating that there's bad news here;,we still aren't to universal love,,and it's true because, although an appreciation of the golden rule is natural,,it's also natural to carve out exceptions to the golden rule. 
 I mean, for example, none of us, probably, want to go to prison,,but we all think that there are some people who should go to prison. Right?,So, we think we should treat them differently than we would want to be treated.,Now, we have a rationale for that.,We say they did these bad things that make it just that they should go to prison. 
 None of us really extends the golden rule in truly diffuse and universal fashion.,We have the capacity to carve out exceptions,,put people in a special category.,And the problem is that -- although in the case of sending people to prison,,you have this impartial judiciary,determining who gets excluded from the golden rule --,that in everyday life, the way we all make these decisions,about who we're not going to extend the golden rule to,,is we use a much rougher and readier formula.,Basically it's just like, if you're my enemy, if you're my rival --,if you're not my friend, if you're not in my family --,I'm much less inclined to apply the golden rule to you. 
 We all do that,,and you see it all over the world.,You see it in the Middle East:,people who, from Gaza, are firing missiles at Israel.,They wouldn't want to have missiles fired at them, but they say,,"Well, but the Israelis, or some of them have done things,that put them in a special category.",The Israelis would not want to have an economic blockade imposed on them,,but they impose one on Gaza, and they say,,"Well, the Palestinians, or some of them, have brought this on themselves." 
 So, it's these exclusions to the golden rule that amount to a lot of the world's trouble.,And it's natural to do that.,So, the fact that the golden rule is in some sense built in to us,is not, by itself, going to bring us universal love.,It's not going to save the world. 
 Now, there's one piece of good news I have that may save the world. Okay.,Are you on the edges of your seats here?,Good, because before I tell you about that good news,,I'm going to have to take a little excursion through some academic terrain.,So, I hope I've got your attention with this promise of good news,that may save the world. 
 It's this non-zero-sumness stuff you just heard a little bit about.,It's just a quick introduction to game theory.,This won't hurt. Okay.,It's about zero-sum and non-zero-sum games.,If you ask what kind of a situation,is conducive to people becoming friends and allies,,the technical answer is a non-zero-sum situation.,And if you ask what kind of situation,is conducive to people defining people as enemies,,it's a zero-sum situation. 
 So, what do those terms mean?,Basically, a zero-sum game is the kind you're used to in sports,,where there's a winner and a loser.,So, their fortunes add up to zero.,So, in tennis, every point is either good for you and bad for the other person,,or good for them, bad for you.,Either way, your fortunes add up to zero. That's a zero-sum game. 
 Now, if you're playing doubles,,then the person on your side of the net,is in a non-zero-sum relationship with you,,because every point is either good for both of you -- positive, win-win --,or bad for both of you, it's lose-lose.,That's a non-zero-sum game.,And in real life, there are lots of non-zero-sum games.,In the realm of economics, say, if you buy something:,that means you'd rather have the merchandise than the money,,but the merchant would rather have the money than the merchandise.,You both feel you've won.,In a war, two allies are playing a non-zero-sum game.,It's going to either be win-win or lose-lose for them. 
 So, there are lots of non-zero-sum games in real life.,And you could basically reformulate what I said earlier,,about how compassion is deployed and the golden rule is deployed,,by just saying, well, compassion most naturally flows along non-zero-sum channels,where people perceive themselves as being in a potentially win-win situation,with some of their friends or allies.,The deployment of the golden rule,most naturally happens along these non-zero-sum channels.,So, kind of webs of non-zero-sumness,are where you would expect compassion and the golden rule,to kind of work their magic.,With zero-sum channels you would expect something else. 
 Okay. So, now you're ready for the good news that I said might save the world.,And now I can admit that it might not too,,now that I've held your attention for three minutes of technical stuff.,But it may. And the good news is that history,has naturally expanded these webs of non-zero-sumness,,these webs that can be these channels for compassion.,You can go back all the way to the stone age:,technological evolution -- roads, the wheel, writing,,a lot of transportation and communication technologies --,has just inexorably made it so that more people,can be in more non-zero-sum relationships,with more and more people at greater and greater distances.,That's the story of civilization.,It's why social organization has grown from the hunter-gatherer village,to the ancient state, the empire, and now here we are in a globalized world.,And the story of globalization is largely a story of non-zero-sumness. 
 You've probably heard the term "interdependence",applied to the modern world. Well, that's just another term for non-zero-sum.,If your fortunes are interdependent with somebody,,then you live in a non-zero-sum relationship with them.,And you see this all the time in the modern world.,You saw it with the recent economic crash,,where bad things happen in the economy --,bad for everybody, for much of the world.,Good things happen, and it's good for much of the world. 
 And, you know, I'm happy to say, I think there's really evidence,that this non-zero-sum kind of connection,can expand the moral compass.,I mean, if you look at the American attitudes,toward Japanese during World War II --,look at the depictions of Japanese,in the American media as just about subhuman,,and look at the fact that we dropped atomic bombs,,really without giving it much of a thought --,and you compare that to the attitude now,,I think part of that is due to a kind of economic interdependence. 
 Any form of interdependence, or non-zero-sum relationship,forces you to acknowledge the humanity of people.,So, I think that's good.,And the world is full of non-zero-sum dynamics.,Environmental problems, in many ways, put us all in the same boat.,And there are non-zero-sum relationships that maybe people aren't aware of. 
 For example, probably a lot of American Christians,don't think of themselves as being in a non-zero-sum relationship,with Muslims halfway around the world,,but they really are, because if these Muslims become happier and happier,with their place in the world and feel that they have a place in it,,that's good for Americans, because there will be fewer terrorists,to threaten American security.,If they get less and less happy, that will be bad for Americans. 
 So, there's plenty of non-zero-sumness.,And so, the question is: If there's so much non-zero-sumness,,why has the world not yet been suffused in love, peace, and understanding?,The answer's complicated. It's the occasion for a whole other talk.,Certainly, a couple of things are that,,first of all, there are a lot of zero-sum situations in the world.,And also, sometimes people don't recognize,the non-zero-sum dynamics in the world.,In both of these areas,,I think politicians can play a role. 
 This isn't only about religion.,I think politicians can help foster non-zero-sum relationships,,Economic engagement is generally better than blockades and so on,,in this regard.,And politicians can be aware, and should be aware that,,when people around the world are looking at them,,are looking at their nation,and picking up their cues,for whether they are in a zero-sum or a non-zero-sum relationship with a nation --,like, say, America, or any other nation --,human psychology is such that they use cues like:,Do we feel we're being respected?,Because, you know, historically, if you're not being respected,,you're probably not going to wind up in a non-zero-sum,,mutually profitable relationship with people.,So, we need to be aware of what kind of signals we're sending out.,And some of this, again, is in the realm of political work. 
 If there's one thing I can encourage everyone to do,,politicians, religious leaders, and us,,it would be what I call "expanding the moral imagination" --,that is to say, your ability to put yourself in the shoes,of people in very different circumstances.,This is not the same as compassion,,but it's conducive to compassion. It opens the channels for compassion.,And I'm afraid we have another good news/bad news story,,which is that the moral imagination is part of human nature.,That's good, but again we tend to deploy it selectively. 
 Once we define somebody as an enemy,,we have trouble putting ourselves in their shoes, just naturally.,So, if you want to take a particularly hard case for an American:,somebody in Iran who is burning an American flag, and you see them on TV.,Well, the average American is going to resist,the moral exercise of putting themselves in that person's head,and is going to resist the idea that they have much in common with that person.,And if you tell them, "Well, they think America disrespects them,and even wants to dominate them, and they hate America.,Has there ever been somebody who disrespected you so much,that you kind of hated them briefly"?,You know, they'll resist that comparison and that's natural, that's human. 
 And, similarly, the person in Iran:,when you try to humanize somebody in America who said that Islam is evil,,they'll have trouble with that.,So, it's a very difficult thing to get people to expand the moral imagination,to a place it doesn't naturally go.,I think it's worth the trouble because,,again, it just helps us to understand.,If you want to reduce the number of people who are burning flags,,it helps to understand what makes them do it.,And I think it's good moral exercise. 
 I would say here is where religious leaders come in,,because religious leaders are good at reframing issues for people,,at harnessing the emotional centers of the brain,to get people to alter their awareness and reframe the way they think.,I mean, religious leaders are kind of in the inspiration business.,It's their great calling right now,,to get people all around the world better at expanding their moral imaginations,,appreciating that in so many ways they're in the same boat. 
 I would just sum up the way things look, at least from this secular perspective,,as far as compassion and the golden rule go,,by saying that it's good news that compassion and the golden rule,are in some sense built into human nature.,It's unfortunate that they tend to be selectively deployed.,And it's going to take real work to change that.,But, nobody ever said that doing God's work was going to be easy. Thanks.,(Applause)This is actually a painting,that hangs at the Countway Library at Harvard Medical School.,And it shows the first time an organ was ever transplanted.,In the front, you see, actually, Joe Murray,getting the patient ready for the transplant,,while in the back room you see Hartwell Harrison,,the Chief of Urology at Harvard,,actually harvesting the kidney.,The kidney was indeed the first organ,ever to be transplanted to the human. 
 That was back in 1954,,55 years ago.,Yet we're still dealing with a lot of the same challenges,as many decades ago.,Certainly many advances, many lives saved.,But we have a major shortage of organs.,In the last decade the number of patients,waiting for a transplant has doubled.,While, at the same time, the actual number of transplants,has remained almost entirely flat.,That really has to do with our aging population.,We're just getting older.,Medicine is doing a better job,of keeping us alive.,But as we age, our organs tend to fail more. 
 So, that's a challenge,,not just for organs but also for tissues.,Trying to replace pancreas,,trying to replace nerves that can help us with Parkinson's.,These are major issues.,This is actually a very stunning statistic.,Every 30 seconds,a patient dies from diseases,that could be treated with tissue regeneration or replacement.,So, what can we do about it?,We've talked about stem cells tonight.,That's a way to do it.,But still ways to go to get stem cells into patients,,in terms of actual therapies for organs. 
 Wouldn't it be great if our bodies could regenerate?,Wouldn't it be great if we could actually harness the power,of our bodies, to actually heal ourselves?,It's not really that foreign of a concept, actually;,it happens on the Earth every day.,This is actually a picture of a salamander.,Salamanders have this amazing capacity to regenerate.,You see here a little video.,This is actually a limb injury in this salamander.,And this is actually real photography,,timed photography, showing how that limb regenerates,in a period of days.,You see the scar form.,And that scar actually grows out,a new limb. 
 So, salamanders can do it.,Why can't we? Why can't humans regenerate?,Actually, we can regenerate.,Your body has many organs,and every single organ in your body,has a cell population,that's ready to take over at the time of injury. It happens every day.,As you age, as you get older.,Your bones regenerate every 10 years.,Your skin regenerates every two weeks.,So, your body is constantly regenerating.,The challenge occurs when there is an injury.,At the time of injury or disease,,the body's first reaction,is to seal itself off from the rest of the body.,It basically wants to fight off infection,,and seal itself, whether it's organs inside your body,,or your skin, the first reaction,is for scar tissue to move in,,to seal itself off from the outside. 
 So, how can we harness that power?,One of the ways that we do that,is actually by using smart biomaterials.,How does this work? Well, on the left side here,you see a urethra which was injured.,This is the channel that connects the bladder to the outside of the body.,And you see that it is injured.,We basically found out that you can use these smart biomaterials,that you can actually use as a bridge.,If you build that bridge, and you close off,from the outside environment,,then you can create that bridge, and cells,that regenerate in your body,,can then cross that bridge, and take that path. 
 That's exactly what you see here.,It's actually a smart biomaterial,that we used, to actually treat this patient.,This was an injured urethra on the left side.,We used that biomaterial in the middle.,And then, six months later on the right-hand side,you see this reengineered urethra.,Turns out your body can regenerate,,but only for small distances.,The maximum efficient distance for regeneration,is only about one centimeter.,So, we can use these smart biomaterials,but only for about one centimeter,to bridge those gaps. 
 So, we do regenerate, but for limited distances.,What do we do now,,if you have injury for larger organs?,What do we do when we have injuries,for structures which are much larger,than one centimeter?,Then we can start to use cells.,The strategy here, is if a patient comes in to us,with a diseased or injured organ,,you can take a very small piece of tissue from that organ,,less than half the size of a postage stamp,,you can then tease that tissue apart,,and look at its basic components,,the patient's own cells,,you take those cells out,,grow and expand those cells outside the body in large quantities,,and then we then use scaffold materials. 
 To the naked eye they look like a piece of your blouse,,or your shirt, but actually,these materials are fairly complex,and they are designed to degrade once inside the body.,It disintegrates a few months later.,It's acting only as a cell delivery vehicle.,It's bringing the cells into the body. It's allowing,the cells to regenerate new tissue,,and once the tissue is regenerated the scaffold goes away. 
 And that's what we did for this piece of muscle.,This is actually showing a piece of muscle and how we go through,the structures to actually engineer the muscle.,We take the cells, we expand them,,we place the cells on the scaffold,,and we then place the scaffold back into the patient.,But actually, before placing the scaffold into the patient,,we actually exercise it.,We want to make sure that we condition,this muscle, so that it knows what to do,once we put it into the patient.,That's what you're seeing here. You're seeing,this muscle bio-reactor,actually exercising the muscle back and forth. 
 Okay. These are flat structures that we see here,,the muscle.,What about other structures?,This is actually an engineered blood vessel.,Very similar to what we just did, but a little bit more complex.,Here we take a scaffold,,and we basically -- scaffold can be like a piece of paper here.,And we can then tubularize this scaffold.,And what we do is we, to make a blood vessel, same strategy.,A blood vessel is made up of two different cell types.,We take muscle cells, we paste,,or coat the outside with these muscle cells,,very much like baking a layer cake, if you will. 
 You place the muscle cells on the outside.,You place the vascular blood vessel lining cells on the inside.,You now have your fully seeded scaffold.,You're going to place this in an oven-like device.,It has the same conditions as a human body,,37 degrees centigrade,,95 percent oxygen.,You then exercise it, as what you saw on that tape. 
 And on the right you actually see a carotid artery that was engineered.,This is actually the artery that goes from your neck to your brain.,And this is an X-ray showing you,the patent, functional blood vessel.,More complex structures,such as blood vessels, urethras, which I showed you,,they're definitely more complex,because you're introducing two different cell types.,But they are really acting mostly as conduits.,You're allowing fluid or air to go through,at steady states.,They are not nearly as complex as hollow organs.,Hollow organs have a much higher degree of complexity,,because you're asking these organs to act on demand. 
 So, the bladder is one such organ.,Same strategy, we take a very small piece of the bladder,,less than half the size of a postage stamp.,We then tease the tissue apart,into its two individual cell components,,muscle, and these bladder specialized cells.,We grow the cells outside the body in large quantities.,It takes about four weeks to grow these cells from the organ.,We then take a scaffold that we shape like a bladder.,We coat the inside with these bladder lining cells.,We coat the outside with these muscle cells.,We place it back into this oven-like device.,From the time you take that piece of tissue, six to eight weeks later,you can put the organ right back into the patient. 
 This actually shows the scaffold.,The material is actually being coated with the cells.,When we did the first clinical trial for these patients,we actually created the scaffold specifically for each patient.,We brought patients in,,six to eight weeks prior to their scheduled surgery, did X-rays,,and we then composed a scaffold specifically for that patient's size,pelvic cavity.,For the second phase of the trials,we just had different sizes, small, medium, large and extra-large.,(Laughter),It's true.,And I'm sure everyone here wanted an extra-large. Right?,(Laughter) 
 So, bladders are definitely a little bit more complex,than the other structures.,But there are other hollow organs that have added complexity to it.,This is actually a heart valve, which we engineered.,And the way you engineer this heart valve is the same strategy.,We take the scaffold, we seed it with cells,,and you can now see here, the valve leaflets opening and closing.,We exercise these prior to implantation.,Same strategy. 
 And then the most complex are the solid organs.,For solid organs, they're more complex,because you're using a lot more cells per centimeter.,This is actually a simple solid organ like the ear.,It's now being seeded with cartilage.,That's the oven-like device;,once it's coated it gets placed there.,And then a few weeks later we can take out the cartilage scaffold. 
 This is actually digits that we're engineering.,These are being layered, one layer at a time,,first the bone, we fill in the gaps with cartilage.,We then start adding the muscle on top.,And you start layering these solid structures.,Again, fairly more complex organs,,but by far, the most complex solid organs,are actually the vascularized, highly vascularized,,a lot of blood vessel supply,,organs such as the heart,,the liver, the kidneys.,This is actually an example -- several strategies,to engineer solid organs. 
 This is actually one of the strategies. We use a printer.,And instead of using ink, we use -- you just saw an inkjet cartridge --,we just use cells.,This is actually your typical desktop printer.,It's actually printing this two chamber heart,,one layer at a time.,You see the heart coming out there. It takes about 40 minutes to print,,and about four to six hours later,you see the muscle cells contract.,(Applause),This technology was developed by Tao Ju, who worked at our institute.,And this is actually still, of course, experimental,,not for use in patients. 
 Another strategy that we have followed,is actually to use decellularized organs.,We actually take donor organs,,organs that are discarded,,and we then can use very mild detergents,to take all the cell elements out of these organs.,So, for example on the left panel,,top panel, you see a liver.,We actually take the donor liver,,we use very mild detergents,,and we, by using these mild detergents, we take all the cells,out of the liver. 
 Two weeks later, we basically can lift this organ up,,it feels like a liver,,we can hold it like a liver,,it looks like a liver, but it has no cells.,All we are left with,is the skeleton, if you will, of the liver,,all made up of collagen,,a material that's in our bodies, that will not reject.,We can use it from one patient to the next.,We then take this vascular structure,and we can prove that we retain the blood vessel supply. 
 You can see, actually that's a fluoroscopy.,We're actually injecting contrast into the organ.,Now you can see it start. We're injecting the contrast into the organ,into this decellularized liver.,And you can see the vascular tree that remains intact.,We then take the cells, the vascular cells,,blood vessel cells, we perfuse the vascular tree,with the patient's own cells.,We perfuse the outside of the liver,with the patient's own liver cells.,And we can then create functional livers.,And that's actually what you're seeing.,This is still experimental. But we are able to actually reproduce the functionality,of the liver structure, experimentally. 
 For the kidney,,as I talked to you about the first painting that you saw,,the first slide I showed you,,90 percent of the patients on the transplant wait list,are waiting for a kidney, 90 percent.,So, another strategy we're following,is actually to create wafers,that we stack together, like an accordion, if you will.,So, we stack these wafers together, using the kidney cells.,And then you can see these miniature kidneys that we've engineered.,They are actually making urine.,Again, small structures, our challenge is how to make them larger,,and that is something we're working on,right now at the institute.,One of the things that I wanted to summarize for you then,is what is a strategy that we're going for in regenerative medicine. 
 If at all possible,,we really would like to use smart biomaterials,that we can just take off the shelf,and regenerate your organs.,We are limited with distances right now,,but our goal is actually to increase those distances over time.,If we cannot use smart biomaterials,,then we'd rather use your very own cells. 
 Why? Because they will not reject.,We can take cells from you,,create the structure, put it right back into you, they will not reject.,And if possible, we'd rather use the cells from your very specific organ.,If you present with a diseased wind pipe,we'd like to take cells from your windpipe.,If you present with a diseased pancreas,we'd like to take cells from that organ. 
 Why? Because we'd rather take those cells,which already know that those are the cell types you want.,A windpipe cell already knows it's a windpipe cell.,We don't need to teach it to become another cell type.,So, we prefer organ-specific cells.,And today we can obtain cells from most every organ in your body,,except for several which we still need stem cells for,,like heart, liver, nerve and pancreas.,And for those we still need stem cells.,If we cannot use stem cells from your body,then we'd like to use donor stem cells.,And we prefer cells that will not reject,and will not form tumors. 
 And we're working a lot with the stem cells that we,published on two years ago,,stem cells from the amniotic fluid,,and the placenta, which have those properties.,So, at this point, I do want to tell you that,some of the major challenges we have.,You know, I just showed you this presentation, everything looks so good,,everything works. Actually no,,these technologies really are not that easy.,Some of the work you saw today,was performed by over 700 researchers,at our institute across a 20-year time span. 
 So, these are very tough technologies.,Once you get the formula right you can replicate it.,But it takes a lot to get there.,So, I always like to show this cartoon.,This is how to stop a runaway stage.,And there you see the stagecoach driver,,and he goes, on the top panel,,He goes A, B, C, D, E, F.,He finally stops the runaway stage.,And those are usually the basic scientists,,The bottom is usually the surgeons.,(Laughter),I'm a surgeon so that's not that funny.,(Laughter) 
 But actually method A is the correct approach.,And what I mean by that is that anytime we've launched one of these technologies,to the clinic,,we've made absolutely sure that we do everything we can,in the laboratory before we ever,launch these technologies to patients.,And when we launch these technologies to patients,we want to make sure that we ask ourselves a very tough question.,Are you ready to place this in your own loved one, your own child,,your own family member, and then we proceed.,Because our main goal, of course,,is first, to do no harm. 
 I'm going to show you now, a very short clip,,It's a five second clip of a patient,who received one of the engineered organs.,We started implanting some of these structures,over 14 years ago.,So, we have patients now walking around with organs,,engineered organs, for over 10 years, as well.,I'm going to show a clip of one young lady.,She had a spina bifida defect, a spinal cord abnormality.,She did not have a normal bladder. This is a segment from CNN.,We are just taking five seconds.,This is a segment that Sanjay Gupta actually took care of. 
 Video: Kaitlyn M: I'm happy. I was always afraid,that I was going to have like, an accident or something.,And now I can just go and,go out with my friends,,go do whatever I want. 
 Anthony Atala: See, at the end of the day, the promise of regenerative medicine,is a single promise.,And that is really very simple,,to make our patients better.,Thank you for your attention.,(Applause)Can geographic information,make you healthy?,In 2001 I got hit by a train.,My train was a heart attack.,I found myself in a hospital,in an intensive-care ward,,recuperating from emergency surgery.,And I suddenly realized something:,that I was completely in the dark.,I started asking my questions, "Well, why me?","Why now?" "Why here?","Could my doctor have warned me?" 
 So, what I want to do here in the few minutes I have with you,is really talk about what is the formula for life and good health.,Genetics, lifestyle and environment.,That's going to sort of contain our risks,,and if we manage those risks,we're going to live a good life and a good healthy life.,Well, I understand the genetics and lifestyle part.,And you know why I understand that?,Because my physicians constantly,ask me questions about this. 
 Have you ever had to fill out those long,,legal-size forms in your doctor's office?,I mean, if you're lucky enough you get to do it more than once, right?,(Laughter),Do it over and over again. And they ask you questions,about your lifestyle and your family history,,your medication history, your surgical history,,your allergy history ... did I forget any history? 
 But this part of the equation I didn't really get,,and I don't think my physicians,really get this part of the equation.,What does that mean, my environment?,Well, it can mean a lot of things.,This is my life. These are my life places.,We all have these.,While I'm talking I'd like you to also be thinking about:,How many places have you lived? 
 Just think about that, you know, wander through,your life thinking about this.,And you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places.,You spend it at rest and you spend it at work.,And if you're like me, you're in an airplane a good portion of your time,traveling some place.,So, it's not really simple,when somebody asks you, "Where do you live, where do you work,,and where do you spend all your time?,And where do you expose yourselves to risks,that maybe perhaps you don't even see?",Well, when I have done this on myself,,I always come to the conclusion,that I spend about 75 percent of my time,relatively in a small number of places.,And I don't wander far from that place,for a majority of my time,,even though I'm an extensive global trekker. 
 Now, I'm going to take you on a little journey here.,I started off in Scranton, Pennsylvania.,I don't know if anybody might hail from northeastern Pennsylvania,,but this is where I spent my first 19 years,with my little young lungs.,You know, breathing high concentrations here,of sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide,and methane gas,,in unequal quantities -- 19 years of this.,And if you've been in that part of the country,,this is what those piles of burning, smoldering coal waste look like. 
 So then I decided to leave that part of the world,,and I was going to go to the mid-west.,OK, so I ended up in Louisville, Kentucky.,Well, I decided to be neighbors to a place called Rubbertown.,They manufacture plastics. They use large quantities chloroprene,and benzene.,Okay, I spent 25 years, in my middle-age lungs now,,breathing various concentrations of that.,And on a clear day it always looked like this, so you never saw it.,It was insidious and it was really happening. 
 Then I decided I had to get really smart,,I would take this job in the West Coast.,And I moved to Redlands California.,Very nice, and there,my older, senior lungs, as I like to call them,,I filled with particulate matter, carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone.,Okay? Almost like the highest in the nation.,Alright, this is what it looks like on a good day.,If you've been there, you know what I'm talking about. 
 So, what's wrong with this picture?,Well, the picture is, there is a huge gap here.,The one thing that never happens in my doctor's office:,They never ask me about my place history.,No doctor, can I remember, ever asking me,,"Where have you lived?",They haven't asked me what kind of the quality,of the drinking water that I put in my mouth,or the food that I ingest into my stomach.,They really don't do that. It's missing.,Look at the kind of data that's available.,This data's from all over the world --,countries spend billions of dollars investing in this kind of research. 
 Now, I've circled the places where I've been.,Well, by design, if I wanted to have a heart attack,I'd been in the right places. Right?,So, how many people are in the white?,How many people in the room have spent the majority of their life,in the white space?,Anybody? Boy you're lucky.,How many have spent it in the red places?,Oh, not so lucky.,There are thousands of these kinds of maps,that are displayed in atlases,all over the world.,They give us some sense of what's going,to be our train wreck.,But none of that's in my medical record.,And it's not in yours either. 
 So, here's my friend Paul.,He's a colleague. He allowed his cell phone to be tracked,every two hours, 24/7,,365 days out of the year,for the last two years, everywhere he went.,And you can see he's been to a few places around the United States.,And this is where he has spent most of his time.,If you really studied that you might have some clues,as to what Paul likes to do.,Anybody got any clues? Ski. Right.,We can zoom in here, and we suddenly see,that now we see where Paul has really spent a majority of his time.,And all of those black dots are all of the,toxic release inventories,that are monitored by the EPA. 
 Did you know that data existed?,For every community in the United States,,you could have your own personalized map of that.,So, our cell phones can now build a place history.,This is how Paul did it. He did it with his iPhone.,This might be what we end up with. 
 This is what the physician would have,in front of him and her when we enter that exam room,instead of just the pink slip that said I paid at the counter. Right?,This could be my little assessment.,And he looks at that and he says,,"Whoa Bill,,I suggest that maybe you not decide,,just because you're out here in beautiful California,,and it's warm every day,,that you get out and run at six o'clock at night.,I'd suggest that that's a bad idea Bill,,because of this report." 
 What I'd like to leave you for are two prescriptions.,Okay, number one is, we must teach physicians,about the value of geographical information.,It's called geomedicine. There are about a half a dozen programs in the world right now,that are focused on this.,And they're in the early stages of development.,These programs need to be supported,,and we need to teach our future,doctors of the world,the importance of some of the information,I've shared here with you today. 
 The second thing we need to do,is while we're spending billions and billions,of dollars all over the world,building an electronic health record,,we make sure we put a place history,inside that medical record.,It not only will be important for the physician;,it will be important for the researchers,that now will have huge samples to draw upon.,But it will also be useful for us.,I could have made the decision, if I had this information,,not to move to the ozone capital,of the United States, couldn't I? I could make that decision.,Or I could negotiate with my employer,to make that decision,in the best interest of myself and my company. 
 With that, I would like to just say that Jack Lord said,this almost 10 years ago.,Just look at that for a minute.,That was what the conclusion,of the Dartmouth Atlas of Healthcare was about,,was saying that we can explain the geographic variations,that occur in disease, in illness, in wellness,,and how our healthcare system actually operates.,That was what he was talking about,on that quote.,And I would say he got it right almost a decade ago.,So, I'd very much like to see us begin to,really seize this as an opportunity to get this into our medical records.,So with that, I'll leave you that,in my particular view of view of health:,Geography always matters.,And I believe that geographic information,can make both you and me very healthy. Thank you.,(Applause)It's not about technology,,it's about people and stories.,I could show you,what recently was on television,as a high quality video:,60 Minutes, many of you may have seen it.,And it was the now director of the entire piece,of the veteran's administration --,who, himself, had lost an arm 39 years ago,in Vietnam --,who was adamantly opposed to these crazy devices,that don't work.,And it turns out that with 60 Minutes cameras rolling in the background,,after he pretty much made his position clear on this --,he had his hook and he had his --,he wore this arm for less than two hours,and was able to pour himself a drink and got quite emotional over the fact,that, quote -- his quote --,it's the first time he's felt like he's had an arm in 39 years. 
 But that would sort of be jumping to the middle of the story,,and I'm not going to show you that polished video.,I'm going to, instead, in a minute or two,,show you an early, crude video,because I think it's,a better way to tell a story. 
 A few years ago I was visited by,the guy that runs DARPA,,the people that fund all the advanced technologies,that businesses and universities probably wouldn't take the risk of doing.,They have a particular interest in ones that will help our soldiers.,I get this sort of unrequested -- by me anyway -- visit,,and sitting in my conference room is a very senior surgeon,from the military,and the guy that runs DARPA. 
 They proceed to tell me a story which comes down,to basically the following. We have used such advanced technologies,now and made them available,in the most remote places that we put soldiers:,hills of Afghanistan, Iraq ...,They were quite proud of the fact that,you know, before the dust clears,,if some soldier has been hurt,they will have collected him or her, they will have brought him back,,they will be getting world-class triage emergency care,faster than you and I would be getting it if we were hurt,in a car accident in a major city in the United States.,That's the good news. 
 The bad news is if they've collected this person,and he or she is missing an arm or leg,,part of the face, it's probably not coming back.,So, they started giving me the statistics on how many of these kids had lost an arm.,And then the surgeon pointed out, with a lot of anger,,he said, "Why is it? At the end of the Civil War,,they were shooting each other with muskets. If somebody lost an arm,,we gave them a wooden stick with a hook on it.,Now we've got F18s and F22s,,and if somebody loses an arm,,we give them a plastic stick with a hook on it." 
 And they basically said, "This is unacceptable,",and then the punchline: "So, Dean,,we're here because you make medical stuff.,You're going to give us an arm.",And I was waiting for the 500 pages of bureaucracy,,paperwork and DODs.,No, the guy says,,"We're going to bring a guy into this conference room,,and wearing the arm you're going to give us,,he or she is going to pick up a raisin or a grape,off this table.,If it's the grape, they won't break it.",Great he needs efferent, afferent, haptic response sensors.,"If it's the raisin, they won't drop it.",So he wants fine motor control: flex at the wrist,,flex at the elbow, abduct and flex at the shoulder.,Either way they were going to eat it. 
 "Oh, by the way Dean. It's going to fit on a 50th percentile female frame --,namely 32 inches from the long finger --,and weigh less than nine pounds.",50th percentile female frame.,"And it's going to be completely self contained including all its power.",So, they finished that. And I, as you can tell,,am a bashful guy.,I told them they're nuts.,(Laughter),They've been watching too much "Terminator.",(Laughter),Then, the surgeon says to me,,"Dean, you need to know,more than two dozen of these kids have come back,bilateral.",Now, I cannot imagine --,I'm sorry, you may have a better,imagination than I do --,I can't imagine losing my arm,,and typically at 22 years old.,But compared to that, losing two?,Seems like that would be an inconvenience. 
 Anyway, I went home that night. I thought about it.,I literally could not sleep,thinking about, "I wonder how you'd roll over,with no shoulders.",So, I decided we've got to do this.,And trust me, I've got a day job, I've got a lot of day jobs.,Most of my day job keeps me busy,funding my fantasies like FIRST and water and power ....,And I've got a lot of day jobs.,But I figured I gotta do this.,Did a little investigation,,went down to Washington, told them,I still think they're nuts but we're going to do it.,And I told them I'd build them an arm.,I told them it would probably take five years to get through the FDA,,and probably 10 years to be reasonably functional.,Look what it takes to make things like iPods.,"Great," he said, "You got two years.",(Laughter),I said, "I'll tell you what. I'll build you an arm,that's under nine pounds,that has all that capability in one year.,It will take the other nine to make it functional and useful.",We sort of agreed to disagree. 
 I went back and I started putting a team together,,the best guys I could find with a passion to do this.,At the end of exactly one year,we had a device with 14 degrees of freedom,,all the sensors, all the microprocessors,,all the stuff inside.,I could show you it with a cosmesis on it,that's so real it's eerie, but then you wouldn't see,all this cool stuff.,I then thought it would be years,before we'd be able to make it really, really useful.,It turned out, as I think you could see,in Aimee's capabilities and attitudes,,people with a desire to do something,are quite remarkable and nature is quite adaptable. 
 Anyway, with less than 10 hours of use,,two guys -- one that's bilateral.,He's literally, he's got no shoulder on one side,,and he's high trans-humeral on the other.,And that's Chuck and Randy together,,after 10 hours -- were playing in our office.,And we took some pretty cruddy home movies.,At the end of the one I'm going to show, it's only about a minute,and a couple of seconds long,,Chuck does something that to this day I'm jealous of,,I can't do it.,He picks up a spoon, picks it up,,scoops out some Shredded Wheat and milk,,holds the spoon level,as he translates it, moving all these joints simultaneously,,to his mouth, and he doesn't drop any milk.,(Laughter),I cannot do that.,(Laughter),His wife was standing behind me.,She's standing behind me at the time,and she says, "Dean,,Chuck hasn't fed himself in 19 years.,So, you've got a choice:,We keep the arm, or you keep Chuck.",(Laughter) (Applause) 
 So, can we see that?,This is Chuck showing simultaneous control,of all the joints.,He's punching our controls guy. The guy behind him,is our engineer/surgeon,,which is a convenient guy to have around.,There's Randy, these guys are passing a rubber,little puck between them.,And just as in the spirit of FIRST,,gracious professionalism, they are quite proud of this,,so they decide to share a drink.,This is a non-trivial thing to do, by the way.,Imagine doing that with a wooden stick and a hook on the end of it,,doing either of those.,Now Chuck is doing something quite extraordinary,,at least for my limited physical skill.,And now he's going to do what DARPA asked me for.,He's going to pick up a grape -- he didn't drop it,,he didn't break it --,and he's going to eat it.,So, that's where we were,at the end of about 15 months.,(Applause) 
 But, as I've learned from Richard,,the technology, the processors, the sensors, the motors,,is not the story.,I hadn't dealt with this kind of problem,or frankly, this whole segment,of the medical world.,I'll give you some astounding things that have happened,as we started this.,After we were pretty much convinced we had a good design,,and we'd have to make all the standard engineering trade-offs you always make --,you can always get three out of four of anything you want;,the weight, the size, the cost, the functionality --,I put a bunch of guys in my plane,and I said, "We're flying down to Walter Reed, and we're going talk to these kids,,because frankly it doesn't matter whether we like this arm.,It doesn't matter whether the,Department of Defense likes this arm.",When I told them that they weren't entirely enthusiastic,,but I told them, "It really doesn't matter what their opinion is.,There is only one opinion that matters,,the kids that are either going to use it or not." 
 I told a bunch of my engineers, "Look we're going to walk into Walter Reed,,and you're going to see people, lots of them,,missing major body parts.,They're probably going to be angry, depressed, frustrated.,We're probably going to have to give them support, encouragement.,But we've got to extract from them,enough information to make sure we're doing the right thing.",We walked into Walter Reed and I could not have been more wrong.,We did see a bunch of people,,a lot of them missing a lot of body parts,,and parts they had left were burned;,half a face gone, an ear burned off. 
 They were sitting at a table. They were brought together for us.,And we started asking them all questions.,"Look," I'd say to them, "We're not quite as good as nature yet.,I could give you fine motor control,,or I could let you curl 40 pounds;,I probably can't do both.,I can give you fast control,with low reduction ratios in these gears,,or I can give you power;,I can't give you both.,And we were trying to get them to all help us,know what to give them.,Not only were they enthusiastic, they kept thinking,they're there to help us.,"Well, would it help if I ...","Guys, and woman,,you've given enough.,We're here to help you. We need data. We need to know,what you need." 
 After a half an hour, maybe, there was one guy at the far end of the table,who wasn't saying much.,You could see he was missing an arm.,He was leaning on his other arm.,I called down to the end, "Hey, you haven't said much.,If we needed this or this, what would you want?",And he said, "You know,,I'm the lucky guy at this table.,I lost my right arm,,but I'm a lefty.",(Laughter),So, he wouldn't say much.,He had a great spirit, like all the rest of them had great spirits.,And he made a few comments.,And then the meeting ended. We said goodbye to all these guys.,And that guy pushed himself back from the table ...,he has no legs. 
 So, we left.,And I was thinking,,"We didn't give them support and encouragement;,they gave it to us.,They're not finished giving yet.",It was astounding.,So, we went back.,And I started working harder, faster.,Then we went out to Brooke Army Medical Center.,And we saw lots of these kids, lots of them.,And it was astounding,how positive they are.,So, we went back,,and we've been working harder yet.,We're in clinical trials,,we've got five of them on people.,We're screaming along.,And I get a call and we go back,to Washington. 
 We go back to Walter Reed,,and a kid, literally,,20 some-odd days before that,was blown up.,And they shipped him to Germany,and 24 hours later they shipped him from Germany,to Walter Reed.,And he was there,,and they said we needed to come.,And I went down,and they rolled him into a room.,He's got no legs.,He's got no arms.,He's got a small residual limb on one side.,Half of his face is gone,,but they said his vision is coming back.,He had one good eye.,His name is Brandon Marrocco. 
 And he said,,"I need your arms,,but I need two of them.","You'll get them.",This kid was from Staten Island.,And he said, "I had a truck,,before I went over there,,and it had a stick.,You think I'll be able to drive it?","Sure.",And I turned around and went, "How are we going to do this?",(Laughter),Anyway, he was just like all the rest of them.,He doesn't really want a lot.,He wants to help. He told me that,he wanted to go back,to help his buddies. 
 So, I was on my way out here.,I was asked to stop at Texas.,There were 3,500 people,,the Veteran's Administration,,U.S. ... just 3,500 at this huge event,to help the families,of all the kids --,some that have died, some that are,like Brandon --,and they wanted me to speak.,I said, "What am I going to say?,This is not a happy thing. Look, if this happens to you,,I can give you ... This stuff is,still not as good at the original equipment.","You need to come." 
 So, I went.,And, as I think you get the point,,there were a lot people there recovering.,Some further along than others.,But universally, these people that had been through this,had astounding attitudes,,and just the fact that people care,makes a huge difference to them. 
 I'll shut up, except one message,or concern I have.,I don't think anybody does it intentionally,,but there were people there literally talking about,,"Well, how much will they get?",You know, this country is involved as we've all heard,,in this great healthcare debate.,"Who is entitled to what?,Who is entitled to how much?,Who is going to pay for it?",Those are tough questions.,I don't have an answer to that. Not everybody,can be entitled to everything simply because you were born here.,It's not possible. It would be nice,but let's be realistic. 
 They were tough questions. There's polarized groups down there.,I don't know the answers.,There are other questions that are tough.,"Should we be there?,How do we get out?,What do we need to do?" There's very polarized,answers to that question too,,and I don't have any answers to that.,Those are political questions, economic questions,,strategic questions.,I don't have the answer. But let me give you a simple,concern or maybe statement, then.,It is an easy answer. 
 I know what these kids deserve,on the healthcare side.,I was talking to one of them,,and he was really liking this arm --,it's way, way, way better than a plastic,stick with a hook on it --,but there's nobody in this room that would rather have that,than the one you got.,But I was saying to him, "You know,,the first airplane,went 100 feet in 1903.,Wilbur and Orville.,But you know what? It wouldn't have made an old pigeon jealous.,But now we got Eagles out there,,F15s, even that Bald Eagle.,I've never seen a bird flying around at Mach 2.,I think eventually we'll make these things extraordinary.",And I said to that kid,,"I'll stop when your buddies,are envious of your Luke arm,because of what it can do, and how it does it.,And we'll keep working. And I'm not going to stop working,until we do that." 
 And I think this country,ought to continue its great debate,,whining and complaining, "I'm entitled." "You're a victim.",And whining and complaining about what our foreign policy ought to be.,But while we have the luxury of whining and complaining about,who's paying for what and how much we get,,the people that are out there,giving us that great privilege of whining and complaining,,I know what they deserve:,everything humanly possible.,And we ought to give it to them.,(Applause)As a magician, I try to create imagesnthat make people stop and think.,I also try to challenge myself,to do things that doctorsnsay are not possible.,I was buried alivenin New York City in a coffin,,buried alive in a coffinnin April, 1999, for a week.,I lived there with nothing but water.,And it ended up being so much fun,that I decided I could pursuendoing more of these things.,The next one is I froze myselfnin a block of ice,for three days and three nightsnin New York City.,That one was way more difficultnthan I had expected.,The one after that, I stoodnon top of a hundred-foot pillar,for 36 hours.,I began to hallucinate so hard,that the buildings that were behind menstarted to look like big animal heads. 
 So, next I went to London.,In London I livednin a glass box for 44 days,with nothing but water.,It was, for me, one of the most difficultnthings I'd ever done,,but it was also the most beautiful.,There was so many skeptics,nespecially the press in London,,that they started flying cheeseburgersnon helicopters around my box to tempt me. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, I felt very validated,when the New England Journal of Medicinenactually used the research for science. 
 My next pursuit was I wanted to seenhow long I could go without breathing,,like how long I could survivenwith nothing, not even air.,I didn't realize that it would becomenthe most amazing journey of my life. 
 As a young magician,,I was obsessed with Houdininand his underwater challenges.,So, I began, early on,ncompeting against the other kids,,seeing how long I could stay underwaternwhile they went up and down to breathe,,you know, five times,nwhile I stayed under on one breath.,By the time I was a teenager,,I was able to hold my breathnfor three minutes and 30 seconds.,I would later find outnthat was Houdini's personal record. 
 In 1987 I heard of a story,about a boy that fell through icenand was trapped under a river.,He was underneath,nnot breathing for 45 minutes.,When the rescue workers came,,they resuscitated himnand there was no brain damage.,His core temperaturenhad dropped to 77 degrees.,As a magician,nI think everything is possible.,And I think if somethingnis done by one person,,it can be done by others.,I started to think,,if the boy could survivenwithout breathing for that long,,there must be a way that I could do it. 
 So, I met with a top neurosurgeon.,And I asked him, how longnis it possible to go without breathing,,like how long could I go without air?,And he said to me that anythingnover six minutes,you have a serious risknof hypoxic brain damage.,So, I took that as a challenge, basically. 
 (Laughter) 
 My first try, I figurednthat I could do something similar,,and I created a water tank,,and I filled it with icenand freezing cold water.,And I stayed inside of that water tank,hoping my core temperaturenwould start to drop.,And I was shivering.,In my first attempt to hold my breath,nI couldn't even last a minute.,So, I realized that was completelynnot going to work. 
 I went to talk to a doctor friend --,and I asked him, "How could I do that?","I want to hold my breath for a reallynlong time. How could it be done?",And he said, "David, you're a magician,,create the illusion of not breathing,nit will be much easier." 
 (Laughter) 
 So, he came up with this ideanof creating a rebreather,,with a CO2 scrubber,,which was basicallyna tube from Home Depot,,with a balloon duct-taped to it,,that he thought we could put inside of me,,and somehow be able to circulatenthe air and rebreathe,with this thing in me.,This is a little hard to watch.,But this is that attempt.,So, that clearly wasn't going to work. 
 (Laughter) 
 Then I actually started thinkingnabout liquid breathing.,There is a chemicalnthat's called perflubron.,And it's so high in oxygen levelsnthat in theory you could breathe it.,So, I got my hands on that chemical,,filled the sink up with it,nand stuck my face in the sink,and tried to breathe that in,nwhich was really impossible.,It's basically like tryingnto breathe, as a doctor said,,while having an elephantnstanding on your chest.,So, that idea disappeared. 
 Then I started thinking,,would it be possible to hook upna heart/lung bypass machine,and have a surgery where it wasna tube going into my artery,,and then appear to not breathenwhile they were oxygenating my blood?,Which was another insane idea, obviously. 
 Then I thought aboutnthe craziest idea of all the ideas:,to actually do it. 
 (Laughter) 
 To actually try to holdnmy breath past the point,that doctors wouldnconsider you brain dead.,So, I started researchingninto pearl divers.,You know, because they go downnfor four minutes on one breath.,And when I was researching pearl divers,nI found the world of free-diving.,It was the most amazing thingnthat I ever discovered, pretty much.,There is many differentnaspects to free-diving.,There is depth records,nwhere people go as deep as they can.,And then there is static apnea.,That's holding your breathnas long as you can,in one place without moving.,That was the one that I studied. 
 The first thing that I learnednis when you're holding your breath,,you should never move at all;nthat wastes energy.,And that depletes oxygen,,and it builds up CO2 in your blood.,So, I learned never to move.,And I learned how to slownmy heart rate down.,I had to remainnperfectly still and just relax,and think that I wasn't in my body,nand just control that.,And then I learned how to purge.,Purging is basically hyperventilating.,You blow in and out -- 
 (Breathing loudly) 
 You do that, you get lightheaded,nyou get tingling.,And you're really riddingnyour body of CO2.,So, when you hold your breath,nit's infinitely easier.,Then I learned that you havento take a huge breath,,and just hold and relaxnand never let any air out,,and just hold and relaxnthrough all the pain. 
 Every morning, this is for months,,I would wake upnand the first thing that I would do,is I would hold my breath,for, out of 52 minutes,nI would hold my breath for 44 minutes.,So, basically what that meansnis I would purge,,I'd breathe really hard for a minute.,And I would hold, immediately after,nfor five and a half minutes.,Then I would breathe again for a minute,npurging as hard as I can,,then immediately after that I would holdnagain for five and a half minutes.,I would repeat this processneight times in a row.,Out of 52 minutes, you're onlynbreathing for eight minutes.,At the end of thatnyou're completely fried, your brain.,You feel like you're walkingnaround in a daze.,And you have these awful headaches.,Basically, I'm not the best personnto talk to when I'm doing that stuff. 
 I started learningnabout the world-record holder.,His name is Tom Sietas.,And this guy is perfectly builtnfor holding his breath.,He's six foot four. He's 160 pounds.,And his total lung capacitynis twice the size of an average person.,I'm six foot one, and fat.,We'll say big-boned. 
 (Laughter) 
 I had to drop 50 pounds in three months.,So, everything that I put into my body,nI considered as medicine.,Every bit of food was exactlynwhat it was for its nutritional value.,I ate really small controlled portionsnthroughout the day.,And I started to really adapt my body. 
 [Individual results may vary] 
 (Laughter) 
 The thinner I was, the longernI was able to hold my breath.,And by eating so wellnand training so hard,,my resting heart-rate droppednto 38 beats per minute.,Which is lower than most Olympic athletes.,In four months of training,,I was able to hold my breathnfor over seven minutes.,I wanted to try holdingnmy breath everywhere.,I wanted to try itnin the most extreme situations,to see if I could slownmy heart rate down under duress. 
 (Laughter) 
 I decided that I was goingnto break the world record,live on prime-time television.,The world record wasneight minutes and 58 seconds,,held by Tom Sietas, that guynwith the whale lungs I told you about.,I assumed that I could putna water tank at Lincoln Center,and if I stayed there a week not eating,,I would get comfortable in that situationnand I would slow my metabolism,,which I was sure would help menhold my breath,longer than I had been able to do it.,I was completely wrong. 
 I entered the sphere a weeknbefore the scheduled air date.,And I thought everythingnseemed to be on track.,Two days before my bignbreath-hold attempt, for the record,,the producers of my television special,thought that just watching somebodynholding their breath, and almost drowning,,is too boring for television. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, I had to add handcuffs,nwhile holding my breath, to escape from.,This was a critical mistake.,Because of the movement,nI was wasting oxygen.,And by seven minutes I had goneninto these awful convulsions.,By 7:08, I started to black out.,And by seven minutes and 30 seconds,,they had to pull my body outnand bring me back.,I had failed on every level. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, naturally, the only way outnof the slump that I could think of was,,I decided to call Oprah. 
 (Laughter) 
 I told her that I wanted to up the ante,and hold my breath longernthan any human being ever had.,This was a different record.,This was a pure O2 static apnea record,that Guinness had setnthe world record at 13 minutes.,So, basically you breathe pure O2 first,noxygenating your body, flushing out CO2,,and you are able to hold much longer.,I realized that my real competitionnwas the beaver. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Laughter ends) 
 In January of '08,,Oprah gave me four monthsnto prepare and train.,So, I would sleepnin a hypoxic tent every night.,A hypoxic tent is a tentnthat simulates altitude at 15,000 feet.,So, it's like base camp, Everest.,What that does is, you start building upnthe red bloodcell count in your body,,which helps you carry oxygen better.,Every morning, again,nafter getting out of that tent,,your brain is completely wiped out.,My first attempt on pure O2,nI was able to go up to 15 minutes.,So, it was a pretty big success. 
 The neurosurgeonnpulled me out of the water,because in his mind, at 15 minutesnyour brain is done, you're brain dead.,So, he pulled me up, and I was fine.,There was one person therenthat was definitely not impressed.,It was my ex-girlfriend.,While I was breaking the recordnunderwater for the first time,,she was sifting through my Blackberry,nchecking all my messages. 
 (Laughter) 
 My brother had a picture of it.nIt is really -- 
 (Laughter) 
 (Laughter ends) 
 I then announced that I was goingnto go for Sietas' record, publicly.,And what he did in response,nis he went on Regis and Kelly,,and broke his old record.,Then his main competitornwent out and broke his record.,So, he suddenly pushed the record up ton16 minutes and 32 seconds.,Which was three minutesnlonger than I had prepared.,It was longer than the record. 
 I wanted to get the Science Timesnto document this.,I wanted to get them to do a piece on it.,So, I did what any person,seriously pursuing scientificnadvancement would do.,I walked into the New York Times officesnand did card tricks to everybody. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, I don't know if it was the magicnor the lure of the Cayman Islands,,but John Tierney flew down,and did a piece on the seriousnessnof breath-holding. 
 While he was there,nI tried to impress him, of course.,And I did a dive down to 160 feet,,which is basically the heightnof a 16 story building,,and as I was coming up,nI blacked out underwater,,which is really dangerous;nthat's how you drown.,Luckily, Kirk had seen menand he swam over and pulled me up. 
 So, I started full focus.,I completely trained to getnmy breath-hold time up,for what I needed to do.,But there was no way to preparenfor the live television aspect of it,,being on Oprah.,But in practice, I would do itnface down, floating on the pool.,But for TV they wanted me to be uprightnso they could see my face, basically.,The other problemnwas the suit was so buoyant,that they had to strap my feet innto keep me from floating up.,So, I had to use my legs to hold my feetninto the straps that were loose,,which was a real problem for me.,That made me extremely nervous,nraising the heart rate. 
 Then, what they also did was,,which we never did before,nis there was a heart-rate monitor.,And it was right next to the sphere.,So, every time my heart would beat,nI'd hear the beep-beep-beep-beep,,you know, the ticking, really loud.,Which was making me more nervous.,And there was no way to slownmy heart rate down.,Normally, I would startnat 38 beats per minute,,and while holding my breath,nit would drop to 12 beats per minute,,which is pretty unusual. 
 (Laughter) 
 This time it started at 120 beats,nand it never went down.,I spent the first five minutes underwater,desperately trying to slownmy heart rate down.,I was just sitting there thinking,,"I've got to slow this down.nI'm going to fail.",And I was getting more nervous.,And the heart ratenjust kept going up and up,,all the way up to 150 beats.,Basically it's the same thing that creatednmy downfall at Lincoln Center.,It was a waste of O2.,When I made it to the halfwaynmark, at eight minutes,,I was 100 percent certain,that I was not goingnto be able to make this.,There was no way for me to do it. 
 I figured, Oprah had dedicated an hour,to doing this breath-hold thing,nif I had cracked early,,it would be a whole shownabout how depressed I am. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, I figured I'm better off just fightingnand staying there until I black out,,at least then they can pull me outnand take care of me and all that. 
 (Laughter) 
 I kept pushing to 10 minutes.,At 10 minutes you start getting allnthese really strong tingling sensations,in your fingers and toes.,And I knew that that was blood shunting,,when the blood rushes awaynfrom your extremities,to provide oxygen to your vital organs.,At 11 minutes I started feelingnthrobbing sensations in my legs,,and my lips startednto feel really strange. 
 At minute 12 I startednto have ringing in my ears,,and I started to feel my arm going numb.,And I'm a hypochondriac, and I remembernarm numb means heart attack.,So, I started to reallynget really paranoid.,Then at 13 minutes, maybenbecause of the hypochondria,,I started feeling pains all over my chest.,It was awful. 
 (Laughter) 
 At 14 minutes,nI had these awful contractions,,like this urge to breathe. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Laughter ends) 
 At 15 minutes I was sufferingnmajor O2 deprivation to the heart.,And I started havingnischemia to the heart.,My heartbeat would go from 120 to 50,,to 150, to 40, to 20, to 150 again.,It would skip a beat.,It would start. It would stop.nAnd I felt all this.,And I was sure that I was goingnto have a heart attack. 
 So, at 16 minutes what I didnis I slid my feet out,because I knew that if I did go out,nif I did have a heart attack,,they'd have to jump into the bindingnand take my feet out,before pulling me up.,I was really nervous.,I let my feet out,nand I started floating to the top.,And I didn't take my head out.,But I was just floating therenwaiting for my heart to stop,,just waiting. 
 They had doctors with the "Pst,"nyou know, sitting there waiting.,And then suddenly I hear screaming.,And I think that therenis some weird thing --,that I had died or something had happened.,And then I realizednthat I had made it to 16:32.,So, with the energynof everybody that was there,,I decided to keep pushing.,And I went to 17 minutes and four seconds. 
 (Applause) 
 (Applause ends) 
 As though that wasn't enough,nwhat I did immediately after,is I went to Quest Labs,and had them take every bloodnsample that they could,to test for everythingnand to see where my levels were,,so the doctors could use it, once again.,I also didn't want anybody to question it.,I had the world record and I wantednto make sure it was legitimate. 
 So, I get to New York City the next day,,I'm walking out of the Apple store,,and this kid walks up to menhe's like, "Yo, D!",I'm like "Yeah?",He said, "If you reallynheld your breath that long,,why'd you come out of the water dry?",I was like "What?" 
 (Laughter) 
 And that's my life. So -- 
 (Laughter) 
 As a magician,nI try to show things to people,that seem impossible.,And I think magic,,whether I'm holding my breathnor shuffling a deck of cards,,is pretty simple.,It's practice, it's training,nand it's -- (Sobs),It's practice, it's trainingnand experimenting, 
 (Sobs) 
 while pushing through the painnto be the best that I can be.,And that's what magicnis to me, so, thank you. 
 (Applause)The big residual,is always value for money.,All the time we are trying to get value for money.,What we don't look for,is value for many,,while we are generating value for money.,Do we care about those four billion people,whose income levels are less than two dollars a day,,the so-called bottom of the pyramid?,What are the challenges in getting value for money,as well as value for many?,We have described here,in terms of the performance,and the price.,If you have money, of course, you can get the value.,You can get a Mercedes,for a very high price,,very high performance.,But if you don't have money, what happens?,Well, you are to ride a bicycle,,carrying your own weight and also some other weight,,so that you can earn the bread for the day.,Well, poor do not remain poor;,they become lower-middle-class.,And if they do so,,then, of course, the conditions improve,,and they start riding on scooters.,But the challenge is, again, they don't get much value,,because they can't afford anything more than the scooter.,The issue is, at that price,,can you give them some extra value?,A super value,,in terms of their ability to ride in a car,,to get that dignity, to get that safety,,looks practically impossible, isn't it. 
 Now, this is something,that we see on Indian streets,all the time.,But many people see the same thing,and think things differently,,and one of them is here, Ratan Tata.,The great thing about our leaders,is that, should they not only have passion in their belly,,which practically all of them have,,they're also very innovative.,An innovator is one who does not know it cannot be done.,They believe that things can be done.,But great leaders like Ratan,have compassion.,And what you said, Lakshmi, is absolutely true:,it's not just Ratan Tata,,it's the house of Tatas over time.,Let me confirm what she said.,Yes, I went barefoot,until I was 12.,I struggled to [unclear] day,was a huge issue.,And when I finished my SSC, the eleventh standard,,I stood eleventh among 125,000 students.,But I was about to leave the school,,because my poor mother couldn't afford schooling.,And it was [unclear] Tata Trust, which gave me six rupees per month,,almost a dollar per month for six years.,That's how I'm standing before you.,So that is the House of Tata.,(Applause),Innovation, compassion and passion.,They combine all that. 
 And it was that compassion which bothered them,,because when he saw -- in fact, he told me about eight or nine years ago,how he was driving his own car --,he drives his own car by the way --,and he saw in the rain,,a family like the one that I showed to you,getting drenched with an infant.,And then he said, "Well, I must give them a car that they can afford,,one lakh car, $2,000 car.",Of course, as soon as you say something like this,people say it is impossible,,and that's what was said by Suzuki.,He said, oh, probably he is going to build a three-wheeler,with stepney.,And you can see the cartoon here.,Well they didn't build that. They built a proper car. Nano.,And mind you, I'm six feet half an inch,,Ratan is taller than me,,and we have ample space in the front,and ample space in the back in this particular car.,And incredible car.,And of course, nothing succeeds like success;,the cynics then turned around,,and one after the other,they also started saying, "Yes, we also want to make a car in the Nano Segment.,We'll manufacture a car in the Nano Segment." 
 How did this great story unfold,,the making of Nano?,Let me tell you a bit about it.,For example, how we started:,Ratan just began with a five-engineer team,,young people in their mid-twenties.,And he said,,"Well, I won't define the vehicle for you,,but I will define the cost for you.,It is one lakh, 100,000 rupees,,and you are to make it within that.",And he told them,,"Question the unquestionable.,Stretch the envelope.",And at a point in time,,he got so engrossed in the whole challenge,,that he himself became a member of the team.,Can you believe it?,I still am told about this story,of that single wiper design in which he participated.,Until midnight, he'd be thinking.,Early morning he'll be coming back with sort of solutions.,But who was the team leader?,The team leader was Girish Wagh,,a 34 year-old boy in [unclear].,And the Nano team average age,was just 27 years. 
 And they did innovation in design and beyond.,Broke many norms of the standard conventions for the first time.,For example, that a two-cylinder gas engine,was used in a car with a single balancer shaft.,Adhesives were replacing the rivets.,There was a co-creation, a huge co-creation,,with vendors and suppliers.,All ideas on board were welcome.,100 vendors were co-located adjacent to the plant,,and innovative business models for automobile dealerships were developed.,Imagine that a fellow,who sells cloth, for example, will be selling Nano.,I mean, it was incredible innovation.,Seeking solutions for non-auto sectors.,It was an open innovation,,ideas from all over were welcome.,The mechanism of helicopters seats and windows was used, by the way,,as well as a dashboard,that was inspired by two-wheelers.,The fuel lines and lamps,were as in two-wheelers. 
 And the crux of the matter was, however,,getting more from less.,All the time, you have been given an envelope.,You can't cross that envelope,,which is 100,000 rupees, 2,000 dollars.,And therefore, each component,had to have a dual functionality.,And the seat riser, for example,,serving as a mounting for the seat,as well as a structural part,of the functional rigidity.,Half the number of parts,are contained in Nano,in comparison to a typical passenger car.,The length is smaller by eight percent by the way.,But the current entry-level cars,in comparison to that is eight percent less,,but 21 percent more inside space. 
 And what happened,was that -- more from less --,you can see how much more for how much less.,When the Model T was launched --,and this is, by the way, all the figures,that are adjusted to 2007 dollar prices --,Model T was 19,700 by Ford.,Volkswagon was 11,333.,And British Motor was around 11,000.,And Nano was, bang, 2,000 dollars.,This is why,you started,actually a new paradigm shift,,where the same people,who could not dream of sitting in a car,,who were carrying their entire family in a scooter,,started dreaming of being in a car.,And those dreams are getting fulfilled.,This is a photograph,of a house and a driver and a car,near my own home.,The driver's name is Naran.,He has bought his own Nano.,And you can see, there is a physical space,that has been created for him,,parking that car, along with the owner's car,,but more importantly, they've created,a space in their mind that,"Yes, my chauffeur is going to come in his own car and park it.",And that's why I call it a transformational innovation.,It is not just technological,,it is social innovation that we talk about. 
 And that is where, ladies and gentlemen,,this famous theme,of getting more from less for more,becomes important.,I remember talking about this for the first time in Australia,,about one and a half years ago,,when their academy honored me with a fellowship.,And unbelievably, in 40 years,,I was the first Indian to be honored.,And the title of my talk,was therefore "Indian innovation,from Gandhi to Gandhian engineering.",And I titled this more from less for more and more people,as Gandhian engineering.,And Gandhian engineering, in my judgment,,is the one which is going to take the world forward,,is going to make a difference,,not just for a few, but for everyone.,Let me move from mobility in a car to individual mobility,for those unfortunates,who have lost their legs.,Here is an American citizen and his son,having an artificial foot.,What is its price? 20,000 dollars.,And of course, these feet are so designed,that they can walk only on,such perfect pavement or roads. 
 Unfortunately, that's not the case in India.,You can see him walk barefoot,on an awkward land, sometimes in a marshy land,,and so on and so forth.,More importantly,,they not only walk far to work,,and not only do they cycle to work,,but they cycle for work, as you can see here.,And they climb up for their work.,You have to design an artificial foot for such conditions.,A challenge, of course.,Four billion people, their incomes are less then two dollars a day.,And if you talk about a 20,000-dollar shoe,,you're talking about 10,000 days of income.,You just don't have it.,And therefore, you ought to look at alternatives. 
 And that is how Jaipur Foot was created in India.,It had a revolutionary prosthetic fitment and delivery system,,a quick molding and modular components,,enabling custom-made, on-the-spot limb fitments.,You could feel it actually in an hour, by the way,,whereas the equivalent other feet,took something like a day, as so on.,Outer socket made by using heated high-density polyethylene pipes,,rather than using heated sheets.,And unique high-ankle design and human-like looks,,[unclear] and functions.,And I like to show how it looks,and how it works.,(Music),See, he jumps. You can see what stress it must have. 
 (Text: ... any person with a below the knee limb could do this.,... above the limb, yes, it would be difficult ...,"Did it hurt?","No ... not at all.",... he can run a kilometer in four minutes and 30 seconds ...) 
 One kilometer in four minutes and 30 seconds.,(Applause),So that's what it is all about.,And therefore Time took notice,of this 28-dollar foot, basically.,(Applause),An incredible story. 
 Let's move on to something else.,I've been talking about getting more from less for more.,Let's move to health.,We've talked about mobility and the rest of it, let's talk about health.,What's happening in the area of health?,You know, you have new diseases that require new drugs.,And if you look at the drug development 10 years ago and now,,what has happened?,10 years ago, it used to cost about a quarter billion.,Today it costs 1.5 billion dollars.,Time taken for moving a molecule to marketplace,,after all the human and animal testing,,was 10 years, now it is 15 years.,Are you getting more drugs because you are spending more time and more money?,No, I'm sorry.,We used to have 40, now they have come down to 30.,So actually we are getting less from more,for less and less people.,Why less and less people? Because it is so expensive,,so very few will be able to basically afford that. 
 Let us just take an example.,Psoriasis is very dreadful,disease of the skin.,The cost of treatment, 20,000 dollars.,1,000-dollar antibody injections under the skin, by the way,,and 20 of them.,Time for development -- it took around 10 years,and 700 million dollars.,Let's start in the spirit,of more from less and more for more,and start putting some targets.,For example, we don't want 20,000 dollars; we don't have it.,Can we do it [for] 100 dollars?,Time for development, not 10 years.,We are in a hurry. Five years.,Cost of development -- 300 million dollars.,Sorry. I can't spend more than 10 million dollars.,Looks absolutely audacious.,Looks absolutely ridiculous. 
 You know something? This has been achieved in India.,These targets have been achieved in India.,And how they have been achieved ...,Sir Francis Bacon once said,,"When you wish to achieve results,that have not been achieved before,,it is an unwise fancy to think,that they can be achieved by using methods,that have been used before.",And therefore, the standard process,,where you develop a molecule, put it into mice, into men,,are not yielding those results --,the billions of dollars that have been spent.,The Indian cleverness,was using its traditional knowledge,,however, scientifically validating it,and making that journey from men to mice to men,,not molecule to mice to men, you know.,And that is how this difference has come.,And you can see this blending,of traditional medicine, modern medicine, modern science.,I launched a big program,[unclear] CSIR about nine years ago.,He is giving us not just for Psoriasis,,for cancer and a whole range of things, changing the whole paradigm.,And you can see this Indian Psoriasis breakthrough,obtained by this reverse form of [unclear],by doing things differently.,You can see before treatment and after treatment.,This is really getting more from less for more and more people,,because these are all affordable treatments now. 
 Let me just remind you,of what Mahatma Gandhi had said.,He had said, "Earth provides enough,to satisfy every man's need, but not every man's greed.",So the message he was giving us,was you must get more from less and less and less,so that you can share it for more and more people,,not only the current generation,,but the future generations.,And he also said, "I would prize every invention of science,made for the benefit for all.",So he was giving you the message that you must have it for more and more people,,not just a few people.,And therefore, ladies and gentlemen,,this is the theme, getting more,from less for more.,And mind you,,it is not getting just a little more for just a little less.,It's not about low cost.,It's about ultra-low cost.,You cannot say it's a mere treatment 10,000 dollars,,but because you are poor I'll give it for 9,000.,Sorry, it doesn't work. You have to give it for 100 dollars, 200 dollars.,Is it possible? It has been made possible, by the way,,for certain other different reasons.,So you are not talking about low cost, you are talking about ultra-low cost.,You are not talking about affordability,,you are talking about extreme affordability.,Because of the four billion people whose income is under two dollars a day.,You're not talking exclusive innovation.,You're talking about inclusive innovation.,And therefore, you're not talking about incremental innovation,,you're talking about disruptive innovation.,The ideas have to be such,that you think in completely different terms.,And I would also add,,it is not only getting more from less for more,by more and more people, the whole world working for it. 
 I was very touched when I saw a breakthrough the other day.,You know, incubators for infants, for example.,They're not available in Africa.,They're not available in Indian villages.,And infants die.,And incubator costs 2,000 dollars.,And there's a 25-dollar incubator,giving that performance that had been created.,And by whom?,By young students from Standford University,on an extreme affordability project that they had, basically.,Their heart is in the right place, like Ratan Tata.,It's not just innovation, compassion and passion --,compassion in the heart and passion in the belly.,That's the new world that we want to create.,And that is why the message is that of Gandhian engineering. 
 Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to end before time.,I was also afraid of those 18 minutes.,I've still one and a half to go.,The message, the final message, is this:,India gave a great gift to the world.,What was that?,[In the] 20th century, we gave Gandhi to the world.,The 21st century gift,,which is very, very important for the whole world,,whether it is global economic meltdown,,whether it is climate change --,any problem that you talk about,is gaining more from less for more and more --,not only the current generations,,for the future generations.,And that can come only from Gandhian engineering.,So ladies and gentlemen, I'm very happy to announce,,this gift of the 21st century,to the world from India,,Gandhian engineering. 
 (Applause) 
 Lakshmi Pratury: Thank you, Dr. Mashelkar. (R.A. Mashelkar: Thank you very much.) 
 LP: A quick question for you.,Now, when you were a young boy in this school,,what were your thoughts, like what did you think you could become?,What do you think that drove you?,Was there a vision you had? What is it that drove you? 
 RAM: I'll tell you a story that drove me, that transformed my life.,I remember, I went to a poor school,,because my mother could not gather the 21 rupees,,that half a dollar that was required,within the stipulated time.,It was [unclear] high school.,But it was a poor school with rich teachers, honestly.,And one of them was [unclear] who taught us physics.,One day he took us out into the sun,and tried to show us how to find,the focal length of a convex lens.,The lens was here. The piece of paper was there. He moved it up and down.,And there was a bright spot up there.,And then he said, "This is the focal length.",But then he held it for a little while, Lakshmi.,And then the paper burned.,When the paper burned, for some reason he turned to me,,and he said, "Mashelkar, like this,,if you do not diffuse your energies,,if you focus your energies,,you can achieve anything in the world.",That gave me a great message: focus and you can achieve.,I said, "Whoa, science is so wonderful,,I have to become a scientist.",But more importantly, focus and you can achieve.,And that message, very frankly,,is valuable for society today. 
 What does that focal length do?,It has parallel lines, which are sun rays.,And the property of parallel lines,is that they never meet.,What does that convex lens do?,It makes them meet.,This is convex lens leadership.,You know what today's leadership is doing? Concave length.,They divide them farther.,So I learned the lesson,of convex lens leadership from that.,And when I was at National Chemical Laboratory [unclear].,When I was at Council of Scientific Industry Research --,40 laboratories -- when two laboratories were not talking to each other,,I would [unclear].,And currently I'm president of Global Research Alliance,,60,000 scientists in nine counties, right from India to the U.S.,I'm trying to build a global team,,which will look at the global grand challenges that the world is facing.,That was the lesson. That was the inspirational moment. 
 LP: Thank you very much. (RAM: Thank you.) 
 (Applause)Once upon a time,,at the age of 24,,I was a student at St. John's Medical College in Bangalore.,I was a guest student during one month,of a public health course.,And that changed my mindset forever.,The course was good, but it was not the course content,in itself that changed the mindset.,It was the brutal realization,,the first morning,,that the Indian students were better than me. 
 (Laughter) 
 You see, I was a study nerd.,I loved statistics from a young age.,And I studied very much in Sweden.,I used to be in the upper quarter of all courses I attended.,But in St. John's, I was in the lower quarter.,And the fact was that Indian students,studied harder than we did in Sweden.,They read the textbook twice,,or three times or four times.,In Sweden we read it once and then we went partying. 
 (Laugher) 
 And that, to me,,that personal experience,was the first time in my life,that the mindset I grew up with,was changed.,And I realized that perhaps,the Western world will not continue,to dominate the world forever.,And I think many of you have the same sort of personal experience.,It's that realization of someone you meet,that really made you change your ideas about the world.,It's not the statistics, although I tried to make it funny. 
 And I will now,,here, onstage,,try to predict when that will happen --,that Asia will regain,its dominant position,as the leading part of the world,,as it used to be, over thousands of years.,And I will do that,by trying to predict precisely,at what year,the average income per person,in India, in China, will reach that of the West.,And I don't mean the whole economy,,because to grow an economy,of India to the size of U.K. --,that's a piece of cake, with one billion people.,But I want to see when will the average pay, the money,for each person, per month,,in India and China,,when will that have reached that of U.K. and the United States? 
 But I will start with a historical background.,And you can see my map if I get it up here. You know?,I will start at 1858.,1858 was a year of great technological,advancement in the West.,That was the year when Queen Victoria,was able, for the first time, to communicate,with President Buchanan,,through the Transatlantic Telegraphic Cable.,And they were the first to "Twitter" transatlantically.,(Laughter),(Applause),And I've been able, through this wonderful Google and Internet,,to find the text of the telegram,sent back from President Buchanan to Queen Victoria.,And it ends like this: "This telegraph,is a fantastic instrument to diffuse religion,,civilization, liberty and law throughout the world." 
 Those are nice words. But I got sort of curious,of what he meant with liberty, and liberty for whom.,And we will think about that,when we look at the wider picture of the world in 1858.,Because 1858,was also watershed year,in the history of Asia.,1858 was the year,when the courageous uprising,against the foreign occupation of India,was defeated by the British forces.,And India was up to 89 years more of foreign domination. 
 1858 in China,was the victory in the Opium War by the British forces.,And that meant that foreigners, as it said in the treaty,,were allowed to trade freely in China.,It meant paying with opium for Chinese goods. 
 And 1858 in Japan,was the year when Japan had to sign the Harris Treaty,and accept trade on favorable condition for the U.S.,And they were threatened by those black ships there,,that had been in Tokyo harbor over the last year.,But, Japan, in contrast to India and China,,maintained its national sovereignty. 
 And let's see how much difference that can make.,And I will do that by bringing these bubbles,back to a Gapminder graph here,,where you can see each bubble is a country.,The size of the bubble here is the population.,On this axis, as I used to have income per person in comparable dollar.,And on that axis I have life expectancy, the health of people.,And I also bring an innovation here.,I have transformed the laser beam,into an ecological, recyclable version here, in green India. 
 (Applause) 
 And we will see, you know.,Look here, 1858, India was here,,China was here, Japan was there,,United States and United Kingdom,was richer over there.,And I will start the world like this.,India was not always like this level.,Actually if we go back into the historical record,,there was a time hundreds of years ago,when the income per person in India and China,was even above that of Europe.,But 1850 had already been many, many years of foreign domination,,and India had been de-industrialized.,And you can see that the countries who were growing,their economy was United States and United Kingdom.,And they were also, by the end of the century, getting healthy,,and Japan was starting to catch up.,India was trying down here.,Can you see how it starts to move there?,But really, really natural sovereignty was good for Japan.,And Japan is trying to move up there. 
 And it's the new century now. Health is getting better,,United Kingdom, United States.,But careful now -- we are approaching the First World War.,And the First World War, you know,,we'll see a lot of deaths and economical problems here.,United Kingdom is going down.,And now comes the Spanish flu also.,And then after the First World War, they continue up.,Still under foreign domination, and without sovereignty,,India and China are down in the corner.,Not much has happened.,They have grown their population but not much more.,In the 1930's now, you can see,that Japan is going to a period of war,,with lower life expectancy.,And the Second World War was really a terrible event,,also economically for Japan.,But they did recover quite fast afterwards.,And we are moving into the new world.,In 1947 India finally,gained its independence.,And they could raise the Indian flag and become a sovereign nation,,but in very big difficulties down there. 
 (Applause) 
 In 1949 we saw the emergence of the modern China,in a way which surprised the world.,And what happened?,What happens in the after independence?,You can see that the health started to improve.,Children started to go to school.,Health services were provided.,This is the Great Leap Forward, when China fell down.,It was central planning by Mao Tse Tung.,China recovered. Then they said,,"Nevermore, stupid central planning.",But they went up here, and India was trying to follow.,And they were catching up indeed.,And both countries had the better health, but still,a very low economy. 
 And we came to 1978, and Mao Tse Tung died,,and a new guy turned up from the left.,And it was Deng Xiaoping coming out here.,And he said, "Doesn't matter,if a cat is white or black,,as long as it catches mice.",Because catching mice,is what the two cats wanted to do.,And you can see the two cats being here,,China and India, wanting to catch the mices over there, you know.,And they decided to go not only for health and education,,but also starting to grow their economy.,And the market reformer was successful there.,In '92 India follows with a market reform.,And they go quite closely together,,and you can see that the similarity with India and China,,in many ways, are greater than the differences with them. 
 And here they march on. And will they catch up? 
 This is the big question today.,There they are today. 
 Now what does it mean that the --,(Applause),the averages there -- this is the average of China.,If I would split China, look here,,Shanghai has already catched up.,Shanghai is already there.,And it's healthier than the United States.,But on the other hand, Guizhou, one of the poorest,inland provinces of China, is there.,And if I split Guizhou into urban and rural,,the rural part of Guizhou goes down there.,You see this enormous inequity in China,,in the midst of fast economic growth. 
 And if I would also look at India,,you have another type of inequity, actually, in India.,The geographical, macro-geographical difference is not so big.,Uttar Pradesh, the biggest of the states here,,is poorer and has a lower health than the rest of India.,Kerala is flying on top there,,matching United States in health,,but not in economy.,And here, Maharashtra, with Mumbai,,is forging forward.,Now in India, the big inequities are within the state,,rather than between the states.,And that is not a bad thing, in itself.,If you have a lot inequity, macro-geographical inequities,can be more difficult in the long term to deal with,,than if it is in the same area where you have a growth center,relatively close to where poor people are living. 
 No, there is one more inequity. Look there, United States.,(Laughter),Oh, they broke my frame.,Washington, D.C. went out here.,My friends at Gapminder wanted me to show this,because there is a new leader in Washington,who is really concerned about the health system.,And I can understand him, because Washington, D.C.,is so rich over there,but they are not as healthy as Kerala.,It's quite interesting, isn't it?,(Applause),I can see a business opportunity for Kerala,,helping fix the health system in the United States. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Now here we have the whole world. You have the legend down there.,And when you see the two giant cats here, pushing forward,,you see that in between them,and ahead of them,,is the whole emerging economies of the world,,which Thomas Friedman so correctly called the "flat world.",You can see that in health and education,,a large part of the world population is putting forward,,but in Africa, and other parts,,as in rural Guizhou in China,,there is still people with low health and very low economy.,We have an enormous disparity in the world.,But most of the world in the middle are pushing forwards very fast. 
 Now, back to my projections.,When will it catch up? I have to go back to very conventional graph.,I will show income per person on this axis instead,,poor down here, rich up there.,And then time here, from 1858,I start the world.,And we shall see what will happen with these countries.,You see, China under foreign domination,actually lowered their income and came down to the Indian level here.,Whereas U.K. and United States is getting richer and richer.,And after Second World War, United States is richer than U.K.,But independence is coming here.,Growth is starting, economic reform.,Growth is faster, and with projection from IMF,you can see where you expect them to be in 2014. 
 Now, the question is, "When will the catch up take place?",Look at, look at the United States.,Can you see the bubble?,The bubbles, not my bubbles,,but the financial bubbles.,That's the dot com bubble. This is the Lehman Brothers doorstep there.,You see it came down there.,And it seems this is another rock coming down there, you know.,So they doesn't seem to go this way, these countries.,They seem to go in a more humble growth way, you know.,And people interested in growth,are turning their eyes towards Asia. 
 I can compare to Japan. This is Japan coming up.,You see, Japan did it like that.,We add Japan to it.,And there is no doubt that fast catch up,can take place.,Can you see here what Japan did?,Japan did it like this, until full catch up,,and then they follow with the other high-income economies.,But the real projections for those ones,,I would like to give it like this.,Can be worse, can be better.,It's always difficult to predict, especially about the future.,Now, a historian tells me it's even more difficult to predict about the past. 
 (Laughter) 
 I think I'm in a difficult position here.,Inequalities in China and India,I consider really the big obstacle,because to bring the entire population into growth and prosperity,is what will create a domestic market,,what will avoid social instability,,and which will make use of the entire capacity,of the population.,So, social investments in health, education and infrastructure,,and electricity is really what is needed in India and China. 
 You know the climate. We have great international experts,within India telling us that the climate is changing,,and actions has to be taken,,otherwise China and India would be the countries,most to suffer from climate change.,And I consider India and China the best partners in the world,in a good global climate policy.,But they ain't going to pay,for what others, who have more money,,have largely created, and I can agree on that. 
 But what I'm really worried about is war.,Will the former rich countries really accept,a completely changed world economy,,and a shift of power away from where it has been,the last 50 to 100 to 150 years,,back to Asia?,And will Asia be able to handle that,new position of being in charge,of being the most mighty, and the governors of the world?,So, always avoid war,,because that always pushes human beings backward.,Now if these inequalities, climate and war can be avoided,,get ready for a world in equity,,because this is what seems to be happening. 
 And that vision that I got as a young student,,1972, that Indians can be much better than Swedes,,is just about to happen.,And it will happen precisely,the year 2048,in the later part of the summer, in July,,more precisely, the 27th of July.,(Applause),The 27th of July, 2048,is my 100th birthday.,(Laughter),And I expect to speak,in the first session of the 39th TED India.,Get your bookings in time. Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Tyler Dewar: The way I feel right now,is that all of the other speakers,have said exactly what I wanted to say.,(Laughter),And it seems that the only thing left for me to say,is to thank you all for your kindness. 
 TD: But maybe in the spirit,of appreciating the kindness of you all,,I could share with you,a little story about myself. 
 TD: From the time I was very young, onward,,I was given,a lot of different responsibilities,,and it always seemed to me, when I was young,,that everything was laid out before me.,All of the plans for me were already made.,I was given the clothes that I needed to wear,and told where I needed to be,,given these very precious,and holy looking robes to wear,,with the understanding,that it was something sacred or important. 
 TD: But before that kind of formal lifestyle happened for me,,I was living in eastern Tibet with my family.,And when I was seven years old,,all of a sudden,,a search party arrived at my home.,They were looking the next Karmapa,,and I noticed they were talking to my mom and dad,,and the news came to me that they were telling me,that I was the Karmapa.,And these days, people ask me a lot,,how did that feel.,How did that feel when they came and whisked you away,,and your lifestyle completely changed?,And what I mostly say is that,,at that time,,it was a pretty interesting idea to me.,I thought that things would be pretty fun,and there would be more things to play with. 
 (Laughter) 
 TD: But it didn't turn out to be so fun and entertaining,,as I thought it would have been.,I was placed,in a pretty strictly controlled environment.,And immediately,,a lot of different responsibilities,,in terms of my education and so forth, were heaped upon me.,I was separated, largely, from my family,,including my mother and father.,I didn't have have many personal friends,to spend time with,,but I was expected to perform,these prescribed duties.,So it turned out that my fantasy,about an entertaining life of being the Karmapa,wasn't going to come true.,It more felt to be the case to me,that I was being treated like a statue,,and I was to sit in one place,like a statue would. 
 TD: Nevertheless, I felt that,,even though I've been separated from my loved ones --,and, of course, now I'm even further away.,When I was 14, I escaped from Tibet,and became even further removed,from my mother and father,,my relatives, my friends,and my homeland.,But nevertheless,,there's no real sense of separation from me in my heart,,in terms of the love that I feel,for these people.,I feel, still, a very strong connection of love,for all of these people,and for the land. 
 TD: And I still do,get to keep in touch with my mother and father,,albeit infrequently.,I talk to my mother,once in a blue moon on the telephone.,And my experience is that,,when I'm talking to her,,with every second that passes,during our conversation,,the feeling of love that binds us,is bringing us closer and closer together. 
 TD: So those were just a few remarks,about my personal background.,And in terms of other things that I wanted to share with you,,in terms of ideas,,I think it's wonderful to have a situation like this,,where so many people from different backgrounds and places,can come together,,exchange their ideas,and form relationships of friendship with each other.,And I think that's symbolic,of what we're seeing in the world in general,,that the world is becoming smaller and smaller,,and that all of the peoples in the world,are enjoying more opportunities for connection.,That's wonderful,,but we should also remember,that we should have a similar process happening on the inside.,Along with outward development,and increase of opportunity,,there should be inward development,and deepening of our heart connections,as well as our outward connections.,So we spoke and we heard some,about design this week.,I think that it's important for us to remember,that we need,to keep pushing forward,on the endeavor,of the design of the heart.,We heard a lot about technology this week,,and it's important for us to remember,to invest a lot of our energy,in improving the technology of the heart. 
 TD: So, even though I'm somewhat happy,about the wonderful developments that are happening in the world,,still, I feel a sense of impediment,,when it comes,to the ability that we have,to connect with each other on a heart-to-heart, or a mind-to-mind, level.,I feel that there are some things,that are getting in the way. 
 TC: My relationship,to this concept of heart-to-heart connection, or mind-to-mind connection,,is an interesting one,,because, as a spiritual leader, I'm always attempting,to open my heart to others,and offer myself up,for heart-to-heart and mind-to-mind connections,in a genuine way with other people,,but at the same time,,I've always been advised,that I need to emphasize intelligence,over the heart-to-heart connections,,because, being someone in a position like mine,,if I don't rely primarily on intelligence,,then something dangerous may happen to me.,So it's an interesting paradox at play there.,But I had a really striking experience once,,when a group from Afghanistan,came to visit me,,and we had a really interesting conversation. 
 TD: So we ended up talking about the Bamiyan Buddhas,,which, as you know,,were destroyed some years ago in Afghanistan.,But the basis of our conversation,was the different approach to spirituality,on the part of the Muslim,and Buddhist traditions.,Of course, in Muslim,,because of the teachings around the concept of idolatry,,you don't find as many,physical representations of divinity,or of spiritual liberation,as you do in the Buddhist tradition,,where, of course, there are many statues of the Buddha,that are highly revered.,So, we were talking about the differences,between the traditions,and what many people perceived,as the tragedy of the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas,,but I offered the suggestion,that perhaps we could look at this in a positive way.,What we saw in the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas,was the depletion of matter,,some solid substance,falling down and disintegrating.,Maybe we could look at that to be more similar,to the falling of the Berlin Wall,,where a divide,that had kept two types of people apart,had collapsed and opened up a door,for further communication.,So I think that, in this way,,it's always possible for us,to derive something positive,that can help us understand one another better. 
 TD: So, with regard to the development,that we've been talking about,here at this conference,,I really feel,that the development that we make,shouldn't create a further burden,for us as human beings,,but should be used,to improve,our fundamental lifestyle,of how we live in the world. 
 TD: Of course, I rejoice,in the development and the growth and the rise,of the noble land of India, the great country of India,,but at the same time, I think,,as some of us have acknowledged,,we need to be aware,that some aspects of this rise,are coming at the cost,of the very ground,on which we stand.,So, as we are climbing the tree,,some of the things that we're doing,in order to climb the tree,are actually undermining,the tree's very root.,And so,,what I think it comes down to,is a question of, not only having information of what's going on,,but paying attention to that,and letting that shift our motivation,to become more sincere,and genuinely positive.,We have hear, this week,,about the horrible sufferings, for example,,that so many women of the world,are enduring day-to-day.,We have that information,,but what often happens to us,is that we don't really choose to pay attention to it.,We don't really choose to allow that,to cause there to be a shift in our hearts.,So I think the way forward for the world --,one that will bring the path of outer development,in harmony,with the real root of happiness --,is that we allow,the information that we have,to really make a change in our heart. 
 TD: So I think that sincere motivation,is very important for our future well-being,,or deep sense of well-being as humans,,and I think that means sinking in,to whatever it is you're doing now.,Whatever work you're trying to do now to benefit the world,,sink into that,,get a full taste of that. 
 TD: So, since we've been here this week,,we've taken millions of breaths, collectively,,and perhaps we haven't witnessed,any course changes,happening in our lives,,but we often miss the very subtle changes.,And I think,that sometimes we develop,grand concepts,of what happiness,might look like for us,,but that, if we pay attention,,we can see that there are little symbols of happiness,in every breath that we take. 
 TD: So, every one of you who has come here,is so talented,,and you have so much to offer to the world,,I think it would be a good note to conclude on then,to just take a moment,to appreciate how fortunate we are,to have come together in this way and exchanged ideas,and really form a strong aspiration,and energy within ourselves,that we will take the good,that has come from this conference,,the momentum, the positivity,,and we will spread that and plant it,in all of the corners of the world. 
 His Holiness the Karmapa: Tomorrow is my Talk. 
 TD: Lakshmi has worked incredibly hard,,even in inviting me,,let alone everything else that she has done,to make this happen,,and I was somewhat resistant at times,,and I was also very nervous throughout this week.,I was feeling under the weather and dizzy and so forth,,and people would ask me, why.,I would tell them, "It's because I have to talk tomorrow.",And so Lakshmi had to put up with me through all of that,,but I very much appreciate,the opportunity she's given me,to be here.,And to you, everyone, thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 HH: Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)One day a one-eyed monkey came into the forest.,Under a tree she saw a woman,meditating furiously.,The one-eyed monkey recognized the woman, a Sekhri.,She was the wife of an even more famous Brahmin.,To watch her better, the one-eyed monkey climbed onto the tree.,Just then, with a loud bang,,the heavens opened. (Claps),And the god Indra jumped into the clearing.,Indra saw the woman, a Sekhri.,Ah-hah.,The woman paid him no heed.,So, Indra, attracted, threw her onto the floor,,and proceeded to rape her.,Then Indra disappeared. (Clap! Clap!),And the woman's husband, the Brahmin, appeared.,He realized at once what had happened.,So, he petitioned the higher gods,so that he may have justice.,So, the god Vishnu arrived. 
 "Are there any witnesses?" 
 "Just a one-eyed monkey," said the Brahmin. 
 Now, the one-eyed monkey,really wanted for the woman, a Sekhri, to get justice,,so she retold events exactly as they had happened.,Vishnu gave his judgment. 
 "The god Indra has sinned,,in that he has sinned against ... a Brahmin.,May he be called to wash away his sins." 
 So, Indra arrived,,and performed the sacrifice of the horse.,And so it transpired,that a horse was killed,,a god was made sin-free,,a Brahmin's ego was appeased,,a woman ... was ruined,,and a one-eyed monkey was left ...,very confused at what we humans call justice. 
 In India there is a rape every three minutes.,In India, only 25 percent of rapes,come to a police station,,and of these 25 percent that come to a police station,,convictions are only in four percent of the cases.,That's a lot of women who don't get justice. 
 And it's not only about women.,Look around you, look at your own countries.,There is a certain pattern in who gets charged with crimes.,If you're in Australia, it's mostly aboriginals who are in jail.,If you're in India, it's either Muslims or Adivasis,,our tribals, the Naxalites.,If you're in the U.S., it's mostly the blacks.,There is a trend here.,And the Brahmins and the gods, like in my story,,always get to tell their truth as The Truth.,So, have we all become,one-eyed -- two-eyed instead of one-eyed -- monkeys?,Have we stopped seeing injustice? 
 Good morning.,(Applause),You know, I have told this story,close to 550 times,,in audiences in 40 countries,,to school students, to black-tie dinners at the Smithsonian, and so on and so forth,,and every time it hits something.,Now, if I were to go into the same crowd,and say, "I want to lecture you about justice and injustice,",they would say, "Thank you very much, we have other things to do.",And that is the astonishing power of art. 
 Art can go through where other things can't.,You can't have barriers, because it breaks through your prejudices,,breaks through everything that you have as your mask,,that says, "I am this, I am that, I am that.",No. It breaks through those.,And it reaches somewhere where other things don't.,And in a world where attitudes are so difficult to change,,we need a language that reaches through. 
 Hitler knew it; he used Wagner,to make all the Nazis feel wonderful and Aryan.,And Mr. Berlusconi knows it, as he sits atop,this huge empire of media and television and so on and so forth.,And all of the wonderful creative minds who are in all the advertising agencies,,and who help corporate sell us things we absolutely don't require,,they also know the power of the arts. 
 For me it came very early.,When I was a young child, my mother, who was a choreographer,,came upon a phenomenon that worried her.,It was a phenomenon where young brides,were committing suicide in rural Gujarat,,because they were being forced to bring more and more money for their in-laws' families.,And she created a dance piece which then Prime Minister Nehru saw.,He came to talk to her and said, "What is this about?",She told him and he set out the first inquiry,into what today we call Dowry Dance.,Imagine a dance piece,for the first inquiry into something,that even today kills thousands of women. 
 Many years later, when I was working with the director Peter Brook,in "The Mahabharata" playing this feisty feminine feminist,called Draupadi, I had similar experiences.,Big fat black mamas in the Bronx,used to come and say, "Hey girl, that's it!",And then these trendy young things in the Sorbonne would say,,"Madame Draupadi, on n'est pas feministe, mais ça? Ça!",And then aboriginal women in Africa,would come and say, "This is it!",And I thought, "This is what we need,,as a language." 
 We had somebody from public health. And Devdutt also mentioned public health.,Well, millions of people around the world die,of waterborne disease every year.,And that's because there is no clean water to drink,,or in countries like India,,people don't know that they need to soap their hands before defecation.,So, what do they do?,They drink the water they know is dirty,,they get cholera, they get diarrhea, they get jaundice,and they die.,And governments have not been able to provide clean water.,They try and build it. They try and build pipelines; it doesn't happen.,And the MNCs give them machines that they cannot afford.,So what do you do? Do you let them die? 
 Well, somebody had a great idea.,And it was a simple idea. It was an idea that could not profit anybody,but would help health in every field.,Most houses in Asia and India,have a cotton garment.,And it was discovered, and WHO endorses this,,that a clean cotton garment folded eight times over,,can reduce bacteria up to 80 percent from water sieved through.,So, why aren't governments blaring this on television?,Why isn't it on every poster across the third world?,Because there is no profit in it.,Because nobody can get a kickback.,But it still needs to get to people.,And here is one of the ways we get it to people. 
 [Video] Woman: Then get me one of those fancy water purifiers. 
 Man: You know how expensive those are.,I have a solution that requires neither machine,,nor wood, nor cooking gas. 
 Woman: What solution? 
 Man: Listen, go fetch that cotton sari you have. 
 Boy: Grand-dad, tell me the solution please. 
 Man: I will tell all of you. Just wait. 
 Woman: Here father. (Man: Is it clean?) Woman: Yes, of course. 
 Man: Then do as I tell you. Fold the sari into eight folds. 
 Woman: All right, father. 
 Man: And you, you count that she does it right. (Boy: All right, grand-dad.) 
 Man: One, two, three, four folds we make.,All the germs from the water we take. 
 Chorus: One, two, three, four folds we make.,All the germs from the water we take.,Five, six, seven, eight folds we make.,Our drinking water safe we make.,Five, six, seven, eight folds we make.,Our drinking water safe we make. 
 Woman: Here, father, your eight-times folded cotton sari. 
 Man: So this is the cotton sari.,And through this we will have clean water. 
 (Applause) 
 I think it's safe to say that all of us here,are deeply concerned about the escalating violence in our daily lives.,While universities are trying to devise courses in conflict resolution,,and governments are trying to stop skirmishes at borders,,we are surrounded by violence, whether it's road rage,,or whether it's domestic violence,,whether it's a teacher beating up a student and killing her,because she hasn't done her homework, it's everywhere.,So, why are we not doing something,to actually attend that problem on a day to day basis? 
 What are we doing to try and make children,and young people realize,that violence is something that we indulge in,,that we can stop,,and that there are other ways of actually,taking violence, taking anger, taking frustrations,into different things that do not harm other people.,Well, here is one such way. 
 (Video) (Laughs) You are peaceful people.,Your parents were peaceful people.,Your grandparents were peaceful people.,So much peace in one place?,How could it be otherwise? 
 (Music) 
 But, what if ...,Yes. What if ...,One little gene in you,has been trying to get through?,From your beginnings in Africa,,through each generation, may be passed on to you,,in your creation. It's a secret urge, hiding deep in you.,And if it's in you, then it's in me too. Oh, dear. 
 It's what made you smack your baby brother,,stamp on a cockroach, scratch your mother.,It's the feeling that wells up from deep inside,,when your husband comes home drunk and you wanna tan his hide.,Want to kill that cyclist on the way to work,,and string up your cousin 'cause she's such a jerk. Oh, dear.,And as for outsiders, white, black or brown,,tar and feather them, and whip them out of town. 
 It's that little gene. It's small and it's mean.,Too small for detection, it's your built-in protection.,Adrenaline, kill. It'll give you the will.,Yes, you'd better face it 'cause you can't displace it.,You're V-I-O-L-E-N-T.,Cause you're either a victim, or on top, like me. 
 Goodbye, Abraham Lincoln.,Goodbye, Mahatma Gandhi.,Goodbye, Martin Luther King.,Hello, gangs from this neighborhood,killing gangs from that neighborhood.,Hello governments of rich countries,selling arms to governments of poor countries,who can't even afford to give them food.,Hello civilization. Hello, 21st century.,Look what we've ...,look what they've done.,(Applause) 
 Mainstream art, cinema,,has been used across the world to talk about social issues.,A few years ago we had a film called Rang De Basanti,,which suddenly spawned thousands of young people,wanting to volunteer for social change.,In Venezuela, one of the most popular,soap operas has a heroine called Crystal.,And when, onscreen, Crystal got breast cancer,,75,000 more young women went to have mammographies done.,And of course, "The Vagina Monologues" we know about.,And there are stand-up comics,who are talking about racial issues, about ethnic issues. 
 So, why is it,,that if we think that we all agree,that we need a better world,,we need a more just world,,why is it that we are not using the one language,that has consistently showed us,that we can break down barriers, that we can reach people?,What I need to say to the planners of the world,,the governments, the strategists,is, "You have treated the arts as the cherry on the cake.,It needs to be the yeast.",Because, any future planning,,if 2048 is when we want to get there,,unless the arts are put with the scientists,,with the economists,,with all those who prepare for the future, badly,,we're not going to get there.,And unless this is actually internalized, it won't happen. 
 So, what is it that we require? What is it that we need?,We need to break down our vision,of what planners are,,of what the correct way of a path is.,And to say all these years of trying,to make a better world, and we have failed.,There are more people being raped. There are more wars.,There are more people dying of simple things.,So, something has got to give. And that is what I want.,Can I have my last audio track please? 
 Once there was a princess who whistled beautifully.,(Whistling),Her father the king said, "Don't whistle.",Her mother the queen said, "Hai, don't whistle.",But the princess continued whistling.,(Whistling) 
 The years went by and the princess grew up,into a beautiful young woman,,who whistled even more beautifully.,(Whistling),Her father the king said, "Who will marry a whistling princess?",Her mother the queen said, "Who will marry a whistling princess?" 
 But the king had an idea.,He announced a Swayamvara.,He invited all the princes to come and defeat his daughter at whistling.,"Whoever defeats my daughter shall have half my kingdom,and her hand in marriage!",Soon the palace filled with princes whistling.,(Whistling),Some whistled badly.,Some whistled well.,But nobody could defeat the princess. 
 "Now what shall we do?" said the king.,"Now what shall we do?" said the queen.,But the princess said, "Father, Mother, don't worry.,I have an idea. I am going to go to each of these young men,and I am going to ask them,if they defeated correctly.,And if somebody answers, that shall be my wish." 
 So she went up to each and said, "Do you accept that I have defeated you?",And they said, "Me? Defeated by a woman?,No way, that's impossible! No no no no no! That's not possible.",Till finally one prince said,,"Princess, I accept, you have defeated me.","Uh-huh ..." she said.,"Father, mother, this man shall be my wife.",(Whistling) 
 Thank you.,(Applause)As a researcher, every once in a while,you encounter something,a little disconcerting.,And this is something that changes your understanding of the world around you,,and teaches you that you're very wrong,about something that you really believed firmly in.,And these are unfortunate moments,,because you go to sleep that night,dumber than when you woke up.,So, that's really the goal of my talk,,is to A, communicate that moment to you,and B, have you leave this session,a little dumber than when you entered.,So, I hope I can really accomplish that. 
 So, this incident that I'm going to describe,really began with some diarrhea.,Now, we've known for a long time the cause of diarrhea.,That's why there's a glass of water up there.,For us, it's a problem, the people in this room.,For babies, it's deadly.,They lack nutrients, and diarrhea dehydrates them.,And so, as a result, there is a lot of death,,a lot of death.,In India in 1960,,there was a 24 percent child mortality rate,,lots of people didn't make it. This is incredibly unfortunate.,One of the big reasons this happened was,because of diarrhea.,Now, there was a big effort to solve this problem,,and there was actually a big solution.,This solution has been called, by some,,"potentially the most important medical,advance this century." 
 Now, the solution turned out to be simple.,And what it was was oral rehydration salts.,Many of you have probably used this.,It's brilliant. It's a way to get sodium,and glucose together so that when you add it to water,the child is able to absorb it even during situations of diarrhea.,Remarkable impact on mortality.,Massive solution to the problem.,Flash forward: 1960, 24 percent child mortality,has dropped to 6.5 percent today. 
 Still a big number, but a big drop.,It looks like the technological problem is solved.,But if you look, even today,there are about 400,000 diarrhea-related deaths,in India alone.,What's going on here?,Well the easy answer is, we just haven't gotten those salts,to those people.,That's actually not true.,If you look in areas where these salts are completely available,,the price is low or zero, these deaths still continue abated.,Maybe there's a biological answer.,Maybe these are the deaths that simple rehydration,alone doesn't solve. That's not true either.,Many of these deaths were completely preventable,,and this what I want to think of as the disconcerting thing,,what I want to call "the last mile" problem. 
 See, we spent a lot of energy, in many domains --,technological, scientific, hard work,,creativity, human ingenuity --,to crack important social problems with technology solutions.,That's been the discoveries of the last 2,000 years,,that's mankind moving forward.,But in this case we cracked it,,but a big part of the problem still remains.,Nine hundred and ninety-nine miles went well,,the last mile's proving incredibly stubborn. 
 Now, that's for oral rehydration therapy.,Maybe this is something unique about diarrhea.,Well, it turns out -- and this is where things get really disconcerting --,it's not unique to diarrhea.,It's not even unique to poor people in India.,Here's an example from a variety of contexts.,I've put a bunch of examples up here. 
 I'll start with insulin, diabetes,medication in the U.S.,OK, the American population.,On Medicaid -- if you're fairly poor you get Medicaid,,or if you have health insurance -- insulin is pretty straightforward.,You get it, either in pill form or you get it as an injection;,you have to take it every day to maintain your blood sugar levels.,Massive technological advance:,took an incredibly deadly disease, made it solvable.,Adherence rates. How many people are taking their insulin every day?,About on average, a typical person is taking it 75 percent of the time.,As a result, 25,000 people a year go blind,,hundreds of thousands lose limbs, every year,,for something that's solvable. 
 Here I have a bunch of other examples,,all suffer from the last mile problem.,It's not just medicine.,Here's another example from technology:,agriculture. We think,there's a food problem, so we create new seeds.,We think there's an income problem, so we create,new ways of farming that increase income.,Well, look at some old ways, some ways that we'd already cracked.,Intercropping. Intercropping really increases income.,Sometimes in rice we found incredible increases in yield,when you mix different varieties of rice side by side.,Some people are doing that,,many are not. What's going on?,This is the last mile.,The last mile is, everywhere, problematic. 
 Alright, what's the problem?,The problem is this little three-pound machine,that's behind your eyes and between your ears.,This machine is really strange,,and one of the consequences is that people are weird.,They do lots of inconsistent things.,(Applause),They do lots of inconsistent things.,And the inconsistencies,create, fundamentally, this last mile problem.,See, when we were dealing with our biology, bacteria,,the genes, the things inside here, the blood?,That's complex, but it's manageable.,When we're dealing with people like this?,The mind is more complex.,That's not as manageable, and that's what we're struggling with. 
 Let me go back to diarrhea for a second.,Here's a question that was asked in the National Sample Survey,,which is a survey asked of many Indian women:,"Your child has diarrhea.,Should you increase, maintain or decrease the number of fluids?",Just so you don't embarrass yourselves, I'll give you the right answer:,It's increase.,Now, diarrhea's interesting,because it's been around for thousands of years,,ever since humankind really,lived side by side enough to have really polluted water.,One Roman strategy that was very interesting,was that -- and it really gave them a comparative advantage --,they made sure their soldiers didn't drink,even remotely muddied waters.,Because if some of your troops get diarrhea they're not that effective,on the battlefield.,So, if you think of Roman comparative advantage part of it was the breast shields,,the breastplates, but part of it was drinking the right water. 
 So, here are these women. They've seen their parents,have struggled with diarrhea, they've struggled with diarrhea,,they've seen lots of deaths. How do they answer this question?,In India, 35 to 50 percent say "Reduce.",Think about what that means for a second.,Thirty-five to 50 percent of women,forget oral rehydration therapy,,they are increasing --,they are actually making their child,more likely to die through their actions.,How is that possible?,Well, one possibility -- I think that's how most people respond to this --,is to say, "That's just stupid.",I don't think that's stupid.,I think there is something very profoundly right in what these women are doing.,And that is, you don't put water,into a leaky bucket. 
 So, think of the mental model that goes behind reducing the intake.,Just doesn't make sense.,Now, the model is intuitively right.,It just doesn't happen to be right about the world.,But it makes a whole lot of sense at some deep level.,And that, to me, is the fundamental challenge,of the last mile. 
 This first challenge is what I refer to as the persuasion challenge.,Convincing people to do something --,take oral rehydration therapy, intercrop, whatever it might be --,is not an act of information:,"Let's give them the data,,and when they have data they'll do the right thing.",It's more complex than that.,And if you want to understand how it's more complex,let me start with something kind of interesting. 
 I'm going to give you a little math problem,,and I want you to just yell out the answer as fast as possible.,A bat and a ball together cost $1.10.,The bat costs a dollar more than the ball.,How much does the ball cost? Quick.,So, somebody out there says, "Five.",A lot of you said, "Ten.",Let's think about 10 for a second.,If the ball costs 10, the bat costs...,this is easy, $1.10.,Yeah. So, together they would cost $1.20.,So, here you all are, ostensibly educated people.,Most of you look smart.,The combination of that produces,something that is actually, you got this thing wrong. 
 How is that possible? Let's go to something else.,I know algebra can be complicated.,So, let's dial this back. That's what? Fifth grade? Fourth grade?,Let's go back to kindergarten. OK?,There's a great show on American television that you have to watch.,It's called "Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?",I think we've learned the answer to that here.,Let's move to kindergarten. Let's see if we can beat five-year-olds.,Here's what I'm going to do: I'm going to put objects on the screen.,I just want you to name the color of the object.,That's all it is. OK? 
 I want you to do it fast, and say it out loud with me,,and do it quickly. I'll make the first one easy for you.,Ready? Black.,Now the next ones I want you to do quickly and say it out loud.,Ready? Go. 
 Audience: Red. Green.,Yellow. Blue. Red.,(Laughter) 
 Sendhil Mullainathan: That's pretty good.,Almost out of kindergarten.,What is all this telling us?,You see, what's going on here, and in the bat and ball problem,is that you have some intuitive ways of interacting with the world,,some models that you use to understand the world.,These models, like the leaky bucket,,work well in most situations.,I suspect most of you --,I hope that's true for the rest of you --,actually do pretty well with addition and subtraction in the real world. 
 I found a problem, a specific problem,that actually found an error with that.,Diarrhea, and many last mile problems, are like that.,They are situations where the mental model,doesn't match the reality.,Same thing here:,You had an intuitive response to this that was very quick.,You read "blue" and you wanted to say "blue," even though you knew your task was red. 
 Now, I do this stuff because it's fun.,But it's more profound than fun.,I'll give you a good example of how it actually effects persuasion.,BMW is a pretty safe car.,And they are trying to figure out, "Safety is good.,I want to advertise safety. How am I going to advertise safety?","I could give people numbers. We do well on crash tests.",But the truth of the matter is, you look at that car,,it doesn't look like a Volvo,,and it doesn't look like a Hummer. 
 So, what I want you to think about for a few minutes,is: How would you convey safety of the BMW? Okay?,So now, while you're thinking about that let's move to a second task.,The second task is fuel efficiency. Okay? 
 Here's another puzzle for all of you.,One person walks into a car lot,,and they're thinking about buying this Toyota Yaris.,They are saying, "This is 35 miles per gallon. I'm going to do,the environmentally right thing, I'm going to buy the Prius,,50 miles per gallon.",Another person walks into the lot,,and they're about to buy a Hummer, nine miles per gallon,,fully loaded, luxury.,And they say, "You know what? Do I need turbo? Do I need this heavyweight car?",I'm going to do something good for the environment.,I'm going to take off some of that weight,,and I'm going to buy a Hummer that's 11 miles per gallon." 
 Which one of these people has done more for the environment?,See, you have a mental model.,Fifty versus 35, that's a big move. Eleven versus nine? Come on.,Turns out, go home and do the math,,the nine to 11 is a bigger change. That person has saved more gallons.,Why? Because we don't care about miles per gallon, we care about,gallons per mile.,Think about how powerful that is if you're trying to encourage fuel efficiency.,Miles per gallon is the way we present things. 
 If we want to encourage change of behavior,,gallons per mile would have far more effectiveness.,Researchers have found these type of anomalies.,Okay, back to BMW. What should they do?,The problem BMW faces is this car looks safe.,This car, which is my Mini, doesn't look that safe.,Here was BMW's brilliant insight, which they embodied into an ad campaign.,They showed a BMW driving down the street.,There's a truck on the right. Boxes fall out of the truck.,The car swerves to avoid it, and therefore doesn't get into an accident. 
 BWM realizes safety, in people's minds, has two components.,You can be safe because when you're hit, you survive,,or you can be safe because you avoid accidents.,Remarkably successful campaign, but notice the power of it.,It harnesses something you already believe.,Now, even if I persuaded you to do something,,it's hard sometimes to actually get action as a result.,You all probably intended to wake up,,I don't know, 6:30, 7 a.m.,This is a battle we all fight every day,,along with trying to get to the gym.,Now, this is an example of that battle,,and makes us realize intentions don't always translate into action,,and so one of the fundamental challenges,is how we would actually do that. OK? 
 So, let me now talk about the last mile problem.,So far, I've been pretty negative.,I've been trying to show you the oddities of human behavior.,And I think maybe I'm being too negative.,Maybe it's the diarrhea.,Maybe the last mile problem really should be thought of,as the last mile opportunity. 
 Let's go back to diabetes.,This is a typical insulin injection.,Now, carrying this thing around is complicated.,You gotta carry the bottle, you gotta carry the syringe.,It's also painful.,Now, you may think to yourself, "Well, if my eyes depended on it,,you know, I would obviously use it every day.",But the pain, the discomfort,,you know, paying attention, remembering to put it in your purse,when you go on a long trip:,These are the day-to-day of life, and they do pose problems.,Here is an innovation, a design innovation.,This is a pen, it's called an insulin pen, preloaded.,The needle is particularly sharp.,You just gotta carry this thing around.,It's much easier to use, much less painful.,Anywhere between five and 10 percent increase in adherence,,just as a result of this. 
 That's what I'm talking about as a last mile opportunity.,You see, we tend to think the problem is solved,when we solve the technology problem.,But the human innovation, the human problem,still remains, and that's a great frontier that we have left.,This isn't about the biology of people;,this is now about the brains, the psychology of people,,and innovation needs to continue all the way through,the last mile. 
 Here's another example of this.,This is from a company called Positive Energy.,This is about energy efficiency.,We're spending a lot of time on fuel cells right now.,What this company does is they send a letter,to households that say, "Here's your energy use,,here's your neighbor's energy use: You're doing well." Smiley face.,"You're doing worse." Frown.,And what they find is just this letter, nothing else,,has a two to three percent reduction in electricity use. 
 And you want to think about the social value of that,in terms of carbon offsets, reduced electricity,,900 million dollars per year.,Why? Because for free,,this isn't a new technology, this is a letter --,we're getting a Big Bang in behavior.,So, how do we tackle the last mile?,I think this tells us there is an opportunity.,And I think to tackle it, we need to combine,psychology,,marketing,,art, we've seen that.,But you know what we need to combine it with?,We need to combine this with the scientific method. 
 See what's really puzzling and frustrating about the last mile, to me,,is that the first 999 miles are all about science.,No one would say, "Hey, I think this medicine works, go ahead and use it.",We have testing, we go to the lab, we try it again, we have refinement.,But you know what we do on the last mile?,"Oh, this is a good idea. People will like this. Let's put it out there.",The amount of resources we put in are disparate.,We put billions of dollars into fuel-efficient technologies.,How much are we putting into,energy behavior change,in a credible, systematic, testing way? 
 Now, I think that we're on the verge of something big.,We're on the verge of a whole new social science.,It's a social science that recognizes --,much like science recognizes the complexity of the body,,biology recognizes the complexity of the body -- we'll recognize,the complexity of the human mind.,The careful testing, retesting, design,,are going to open up vistas of understanding,,complexities, difficult things.,And those vistas will both create new science,,and fundamental change in the world as we see it, in the next hundred years.,All right. Thank you very much.,(Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: Sendhil, thank you so much.,So, this whole area is so fascinating.,I mean, it sometimes feels, listening to behavioral economists,that they are kind of putting into place,academically, what great marketers,have sort of intuitively known for a long time.,How much is your field talking to great marketers,about their insights into human psychology?,Because they've seen it on the ground. 
 Sendhil Mullainathan: Yeah, we spend a lot of time talking to marketers,,and I think 60 percent of it is exactly what you say,,there are insights to be gleaned there.,Forty percent of it is about what marketing is.,Marketing is selling an ad to a firm.,So, in some sense, a lot of marketing is about,convincing a CEO, "This is a good ad campaign.",So, there is a little bit of slippage there.,That's just a caveat. That's different from actually having an effective ad campaign.,And one of the new movements in marketing is: How do we actually,measure effectiveness? Are we effective? 
 CA: How you take your insights here,and actually get them integrated,into working business models on the ground,,in Indian villages, for example? 
 SM: So, the scientific method I alluded to is pretty important.,We work closely with companies that have operational capacity,,or nonprofits that have operational capacity.,And then we say, "Well, you want to get this behavior change.,Let's come up with a few ideas, test them,,see which is working, go back, synthesize,,and try to come up with a thing that works,",and then we're able to scale with partners.,It's kind of the model that has worked in other contexts.,If you have biological problems,we try and fix it, see if it works, and then work the scale. 
 CA: Alright Sendhil, thanks so much for coming to TED. Thank you.,(Applause)There are a lot of web 2.0 consultantsnwho make a lot of money.,In fact, they makentheir living on this stuff.,I'm going to try to save younall the time and money,and go through it in the nextnthree minutes, so bear with me.,Started a website in 2005nwith a few friends, called Reddit.com.,It's what you'd callna social news website; 
 basically, the democratic front pagenof the best stuff on the web.,You find some interesting content --nsay, a TED Talk -- submit it to Reddit,,and a community of your peers votes upnif they like it, down if they don't.,That creates the front page.,It's always rising, falling;na half million people visit every day.,But this isn't about Reddit.,It's about discovering new thingsnthat pop up on the web.,In the last four years,nwe've seen all kinds of memes,,all kinds of trends get bornnright on our front page. 
 This isn't about Reddit itself,nit's actually about humpback whales.,Well, technically, it's about Greenpeace,nan environmental organization,that wanted to stop the Japanesengovernment's whaling campaign.,The whales were getting killed;nthey wanted to put an end to it.,One of the ways they wanted to do it,was to put a tracking chipninside one of the whales.,But to personify the movement,nthey wanted to name it. 
 So in true web fashion,nthey put together a poll,,where they had a bunch of very erudite,nvery thoughtful, cultured names.,I believe this is the Farsi wordnfor "immortal.",I think this means "divine powernof the ocean" in a Polynesian language.,And then there was this:n"Mister Splashy Pants." 
 (Laughter) 
 And this was a special name.,Mister Pants, or "Splashy" to his friends,nwas very popular on the Internet.,In fact, someone on Reddit thought,,"What a great thing,nwe should all vote this up.",And Redditors responded and all agreed.,So the voting started.,We got behind it ourselves;nwe changed our logo for the day,,from the alien to Splashy,nto help the cause.,And it wasn't long before other sitesnlike Fark and Boing Boing,and the rest of the Internet startednsaying, "We love Splashy Pants!" 
 So it went from about five percent,nwhich was when this meme started,,to 70 percent at the end of voting.,Pretty impressive, right?nWe won! Mister Splashy Pants was chosen.,Just kidding -- Greenpeacenactually wasn't that crazy about it,,because they wanted onenof the more thoughtful names to win.,They said, "No, just kidding.nWe'll give it another week of voting." 
 Well, that got us a little angry,nso we changed it to Fightin' Splashy. 
 (Laughter) 
 And the Reddit community --nreally, the rest of the Internet,,really got behind this.,Facebook groups were created.,Facebook applications were created.,The idea was, "Vote your conscience,nvote for Mister Splashy Pants.",People were putting up signsnin the real world about this whale. 
 (Laughter) 
 This was the final vote:n78 percent of the votes.,To give you an idea of the landslide,nthe next highest name pulled in three. 
 There was a clear lesson:nthe Internet loves Mister Splashy Pants.,Which is obvious. It's a great name.,Everyone wants to hear their newsnanchor say, "Mister Splashy Pants." 
 (Laughter) 
 I think that's what helped drive this.,What was cool were the repercussions.,Greenpeace created an entirenmarketing campaign around it --,Mister Splashy Pants shirts and pins,,an e-card so you could sendnyour friend a dancing Splashy.,But even more importantnwas that they accomplished their mission.,The Japanese governmentncalled off their whaling expedition.,Mission accomplished:nGreenpeace was thrilled,,the whales were happy -- that's a quote. 
 (Laughter) 
 And actually, Redditorsnin the Internet community,were happy to participate,nbut they weren't whale lovers.,A few, certainly, but we're talkingnabout a lot of people,,really interestednand caught up in this meme.,Greenpeace came back to the sitenand thanked Reddit for its participation.,But this wasn't really altruism;njust interest in doing something cool. 
 This is how the Internet works.nThis is that great big secret.,The Internet providesna level playing field.,Your link is as good as your link,nwhich is as good as my link.,With a browser, anyone can getnto any website no matter your budget.,That is, as long as you cannkeep net neutrality in place. 
 Another important thing is it costsnnothing to get content online.,There are so manynpublishing tools available,,it only takes a few minutesnto produce something.,and the cost of iterationnis so cheap, you might as well. 
 If you do, be genuine.nBe honest, up-front.,One of the great lessonsnGreenpeace learned,is that it's OK to lose control,,OK to take yourselfna little less seriously,,given that, even thoughnit's a very serious cause,,you could ultimately achieve your goal.,That's the final message I want to share:nyou can do well online.,But no longer is the messagencoming from just the top down.,If you want to succeed you've gotnto be OK to lose control. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Actually, I come from Britain,,but I've been living in Maldives for 26 years now.,So, that's home really.,The Maldives, as I'm sure you're aware, are a chain of islands,off the southwest coast of India here.,Capital, Malé, where I live.,Actually, sitting here today in Mysore,,we're closer to Malé than we are to Delhi, for example. 
 If you're in IT, India, obviously, is the place to be at the moment.,But if you're a marine biologist, Maldives is not such a bad place to be.,And it has been my home these years.,For those of you who've been there, fantastic coral reefs,,fantastic diving, fantastic snorkeling.,I spend as much of my time as possible,investigating the marine life.,I study fish,,also the bigger things, whales and dolphins. 
 This is a blue whale. We have blue whales,in the waters around here, off Maldives,,around the waters of India. You can see them off Kerala.,And, in fact, we're very lucky in this region.,One of the best places in the world to see blue whales,is here in this region.,In Sri Lanka, if you go down to the south coast of Sri Lanka,,during the northeast monsoon season,,you can see blue whales very, very easily.,It's probably the best place in the world to see them. 
 Now, when I talk about the northeast monsoon season,,I'm sure many of you here know exactly what I mean,,but perhaps some of you are not quite so sure.,I need to explain a little bit about monsoons.,Now, monsoon, the root of the word "monsoon",comes from the word "season." 
 So, it's just a season. And there are two seasons in most of South Asia.,And in the summer India heats up, gets very hot.,Hot air rises, and air is drawn in off the sea to replace it.,And the way it works is, it comes from the southwest.,It comes off the ocean here and is drawn up towards India.,So it comes from the southwest. It's a southwest monsoon.,Picks up moisture as it crosses the ocean.,That's what brings the monsoon rain.,And then in the winter things cool down.,High pressure builds over India.,And the whole system goes into reverse. 
 So, the wind is now coming from the northeast,out of India, across the Indian Ocean,,this way towards Africa.,Keep that in mind.,Now, I'm a marine biologist, but I'm actually,a bit of an old fashioned naturalist, I suppose.,I'm interested in all sorts of things, almost everything that moves,,including dragonflies. And I'm actually,going to talk, this afternoon, about dragonflies.,This is a very beautiful species, it's called the Oriental Scarlet. 
 And one thing you need to know about dragonflies,,one important thing,,is that they lay their eggs in fresh water.,They need fresh water to breed.,They lay the eggs into fresh water.,Little larvae hatch out in fresh water.,They feed on other little things. They feed on mosquito larvae.,So, they're very important.,They control mosquito larvae, among other things.,And they grow and grow by stages. And they climb out,of the water, burst out, as the adult which we see.,And typically, there is a lot of variation,,but if you have a dragonfly with, say, a one year life cycle,,which is quite typical, the larva, living in the fresh water,,lives for 10 or 11 months.,And then the adult, which comes after, lives for one or two months.,So it's essentially a freshwater animal.,It really does need fresh water. 
 Now, the particular species of dragonfly,I want to talk about is this one,,because most dragonflies, like the one we've just seen,,when the adult is there for its brief one or two months of life,,it doesn't go very far. It can't travel very far.,A few kilometers, maybe, is quite typical.,They are very good fliers, but they don't go too far.,But this guy is an exception.,And this is called the Globe Skimmer,,or Wandering Glider.,And, as the name might suggest, it is found pretty much around the world.,It lives throughout the tropics, the Americas,,Africa, Asia, Australia, into the Pacific.,And it wanders far and wide. We know that much about it.,But it really hasn't been studied very much. 
 It's a rather mediocre looking dragonfly.,If you're going to study dragonflies, you want to study those really bright beautiful ones,,like that red one. Or the really rare ones, the endemic endangered ones.,This is, it seems a bit dull you know.,It's sort of dull-colored. And it's fairly common.,And it occurs everywhere -- you know, why bother?,But if you take that attitude, you're actually missing something rather special.,Because this dragonfly has a rather amazing story to tell.,And I feel very privileged to have stumbled across it,living in the Maldives. 
 When I first went to the Maldives,,dead keen on diving, spent as much of my time,as I could in and under the water.,Didn't notice any dragonflies; maybe they were there, maybe they weren't.,Didn't notice them.,But after some time, after some months, one day,as I was going out and about,,suddenly I noticed hundreds of dragonflies, hundreds of dragonflies.,Something like this, these are all this species Globe Skimmer.,I didn't know at the time, but I know now,,they're Globe Skimmers, hundreds of them.,And they were there for some time. And then they were gone. 
 And I didn't think anything more of it until,the following year, when it happened again,,and then the year after that, and then the year after that.,And I was a bit slow, I didn't really take too much notice.,But I asked some Maldivian friends and colleagues, and yes they come every year.,And I asked people about them and yes,,they knew, but they didn't know anything,,where they came from, or anything.,And again I didn't think too much of it.,But slowly it began to dawn on me that something,rather special was happening. 
 Because dragonflies need fresh water to breed.,And the Maldives, and I'm sure some of you have been there --,so here is home.,So, Maldives, beautiful place.,(Laughter),It's built entirely of coral reefs.,And on top of the coral reefs are sand banks.,Average height, about that much above sea level.,So, global warming, sea level rise, it's a real serious issue.,But I'm not going to talk about that.,Another important point of these sand banks,is that when it rains,,the rainwater soaks down into the soil. So, it's gone.,So, it stays under the soil.,The trees can put their roots into it.,Humans can dig holes and make a well. 
 But dragonflies -- a bit tricky.,There is no surface fresh water.,There are no ponds, streams, rivers, lakes,,nothing like that.,So, why is it that every year,millions of dragonflies, millions,,millions of dragonflies turn up?,I got a little bit curious. In fact I'll stop here,,because I want to ask, and there is a lot of people who,,from India of course, people who grew up spending your childhood here.,Those of you who are Indian or spent your childhood here,,let me have a show of hands, who of you --,not yet, not yet!,You're too keen. You're too keen. No. Hang on. Hang on.,Wait for the go. I'll say go. 
 Those of you who grew up in India,,do you remember in your childhood, dragonflies,,swarms of dragonflies? Maybe at school,,maybe tying little bits of string onto them?,Maybe pulling bits off? I'm not asking about that.,You've only got to say, do you remember seeing lots of dragonflies.,Any hands? Any hands? Yes. Thank you. Thank you.,It's a widespread phenomenon,throughout South Asia, including the Maldives.,And I got a bit curious about it. 
 In the Maldives -- now, in India there is plenty of water,,so, dragonflies, yeah, of course. Why not?,But in Maldives, no fresh water. So, what on Earth is going on?,And the first thing I did was started recording,when they turned up in the Maldives.,And there is the answer, 21st of October.,Not every year, that's the average date.,So, I've been writing it down for 15 years now.,You'd think they're coming from India. It's the closest place.,But in October, remember, we're still in southwest monsoon,,Maldives is still in the southwest monsoon.,But wind is, invariably, every time, is from the west.,It's going towards India, not from India.,So, are these things, how are these things getting here?,Are they coming from India against the wind?,Seemed a bit unlikely. 
 So, next thing I did is I got on the phone.,Maldives is a long archipelago.,It stretches about 500 miles, of course it's India here.,I got on the phone and emailed to friends and colleagues.,When do you see the dragonflies appear?,And pretty soon, a picture started emerging.,In Bangalore, a colleague there sent me,information for three years, average,,24th of September, so late September.,Down in Trivandrum, a bit later.,Far north of Maldives, a bit later.,Then Malé, then further south.,And then the southernmost Maldives.,It's pretty obvious, they're coming from India.,But they are coming 400 miles across the ocean, against the wind.,How on Earth are they doing that?,I didn't know. 
 The next thing I did was I started counting dragonflies.,I wanted to know about their seasonality,,what time of year, this is when they first arrive,,but how long are they around for? Does that give any clues?,So, I started a very rigorous scientific process.,I had a rigorous scientific transect.,I got on my bicycle,,and I cycled around the island of Malé.,It's about five kilometers around,,counting the dragonflies as I go,,trying not to bump into people as I'm looking in the trees. 
 And they're here for a very short time,,October, November, December. That's it.,And then they tail off, there's a few, but that's it.,October, November, December. That is not the northeast monsoon season.,That's not the southwest season.,That's the inter-monsoon,,the time when the monsoon changes. 
 Now, what I said was, you get the southwest monsoon going one way,,and then it changes and you get the northeast monsoon going the other way.,And that sort of gives the impression you've got one air mass,going up and down, up and down. It doesn't work like that.,What happens, actually, is there is two air masses.,And there is a front between them, and the front moves.,So, if you've got India here,,when the front is up above India you're into the southwest monsoon.,Then the front moves into the northeast monsoon.,And that front in the middle is not vertical,,it's at an angle. 
 So, as it comes over towards Malé,I'm standing in Malé underneath the front.,I can be in the southwest monsoon.,But the wind above is from the northeast monsoon.,So, the dragonflies are actually coming from India on the northeast monsoon,,but at an altitude at 1,000 to 2,000 meters up in the air. Incredible.,These little insects, it's the same ones we see out here [in India],,two inches long, five centimeters long,,flying in their millions, 400 miles across the ocean,,at 2,000 meters up. Quite incredible. 
 So, I was quite pleased with myself. I thought wow, I've tracked this one,,I know how they come here. Then I scratched my head a bit,,and that's okay,,I know how they come here, but why do they come here?,What are millions of dragonflies doing, flying out over the ocean every year,to their apparent doom?,It doesn't make sense. There is nothing for them in Maldives.,What on Earth are they doing?,Well, to cut a long story short,,they're actually flying right across the ocean.,They're making it all the way across to East Africa. 
 I know that because I have friends who work on fisheries' research vessels,who have sent to me reports from boats out in the ocean.,I know because we have reports from Seychelles,,which fit in as well, down here.,And I know because,when you look at the rainfall,,these particular insects, these Globe Skimmers,breed in temporary rain water pools.,Okay, they lay their eggs where the seasonal rains are,,the monsoon rains.,The larvae have to develop very quickly.,They only take six weeks. Instead of 11 months, they're six weeks.,They're up, and they're off. 
 Now, here we have, in case you can't read at the back,,the top is rainfall for India.,And we're starting in June. So this is the monsoon rain.,By September, October, it's drying out.,Nothing for these dragonflies. There is no more seasonal rain.,They've got to go hunting for seasonal rain.,And they fly south. As the monsoon withdraws to the south,they come down through Karnataka, into Kerala.,And then they run out of land.,But they are incredibly good fliers. This particular species,,it can fly for thousands of kilometers.,And it just keeps going. And the wind, the northeast wind,swooshes it around and carries it off across the ocean to Africa,,where it's raining.,And they are breeding in the rains of Africa.,Now, this is southeast Africa. It makes it look like there are sort of,two breeding periods here. It's slightly more complicated than that. 
 What's happening is they are breeding in the monsoon rains here.,And the dragonflies you can see today,outside here, on the campus,,are the young of this generation.,They hatched out in India.,They're looking for somewhere to breed. If it rains here they'll breed.,But most of them are going to carry on. And next stop,,perhaps only four or five days away is going to be East Africa.,The wind will swoosh them out across here.,If they pass the Maldives they might go and have a look,,nothing there, they'll carry on. 
 Here, here, Kenya, East Africa,,they've actually just come out of a long drought.,Just last week the rains broke. The short rains broke,and it's raining there now.,And the dragonflies are there. I have reports from my various contacts.,The dragonflies are here now. They're breeding there.,When those guys, they'll lay their eggs now.,They'll hatch out in six weeks. By that time,the seasonal rains have moved on. It's not there, it's down here.,They'll fly down here. And the clever thing is,the wind is always converging to where the rain is.,The rain occurs, these are summer rains.,This is a summer monsoon.,The sun is overhead there. Summer rains in southern Africa.,The sun is overhead, maximum heating,,maximum evaporation, maximum clouds,,maximum rainfall,,maximum opportunities for reproduction. 
 Not only that, because you have this convection,,you have this rising of the air,where it's hot, air is drawn in.,There's a convergence. So, wherever the rain is falling,,the air is drawn towards it to replace the air that's rising.,So, the little fellow that hatches out here,,he gets up into the air, he is automatically carried,to where the rain is falling.,Lay their eggs, next generation, they come up,,automatically carried to where the rain is falling.,It's now back there. They come out, it's time to come back.,So, in four generations, one, two, three,,four and then back. 
 A complete circuit of the Indian Ocean.,This is a circuit of about 16,000 kilometers.,16,000 kilometers, four generations, mind you,,for a two inch long insect. It's quite incredible.,Those of you from North America,will be familiar with the Monarch butterfly.,Which, up until now has had the longest known insect migration.,It's only half the length of this one.,And this crossing here, of the ocean,,is the only truly regular transoceanic crossing,of any insect.,A quite incredible feat.,And I only stumbled on this because I was living in Malé,,in Maldives for long enough,for it to percolate into my brain,that something rather special was going on. 
 But dragonflies are not the only creatures that make the crossing.,There is more to the story.,I'm also interested in birds. And I'm familiar,with this fellow. This is a rather special bird.,It's a falcon. It's called the eastern red-footed falcon, obviously.,But it's also called the Amur Falcon.,And it's called the Amur Falcon,because it breeds in Amurland.,Which is an area along the Amur River, which is up here.,It's the border, much of it is the border,between China and Russia, up here in the far east. 
 So, Siberia, Manchuria.,And that's where it breeds.,And if you're a falcon it's quite a nice place to be in the summer.,But it's a pretty miserable place to be in the winter.,It's, well, you can imagine.,So, as any sensible bird would do,,he moves south. They move south. The whole population moves south.,But then the being sensible stopped.,So, now they don't stop here, or even down here.,No, they turn across here.,They have a little refueling stop in northeastern India.,They come to the latitude of about Mumbai or Goa.,And then they strike out across the ocean, down to Kenya.,And down here, and they winter down here [in southern Africa].,Incredible. This is the most extraordinary migration,of any bird of prey. A quite incredible migration. 
 And they are not the only one that makes the crossing.,They have the most incredible journey, but several make the crossing from India,to Africa. Includes this one, the hobby.,This fellow is a very nice bird, this is the Pied cuckoo.,Those of you from northern India will be familiar with this.,It comes with the monsoons.,This time of year they cross back to Africa.,And this guy, the roller, a rather beautiful bird.,It's known as the Eurasian Roller. In India it occurs in the northwest,,so it's known as the Kashmir Roller.,And these birds, what I've done is I've complied all the records,,all the available records of these birds,,put them together, and found out they migrate at exactly the same time,as the dragonflies.,They make use of exactly the same winds.,They travel at exactly the same time with the same winds,to make the crossing. I know they travel at the same altitude. 
 It's known about the Amur Falcon. This guy, unfortunately,,one of these met an unfortunate end.,He was flying off the coast of Goa,,21 years ago, 1988. October, 1988.,An Indian Navy jet was flying off Goa,,bang! In the middle of the night. Fortunately, a two engine jet,got back to base, and they pulled the remains of one of these [Eurasian Rollers] out.,Flying at night over the Indian Ocean 2,424 meters.,Same height as the dragonflies go.,So, they are using the same winds.,And the other thing, the other important factor,for all these birds, all medium sized fellows,,and this includes the next slide as well, which is a bee-eater.,Bee-eaters eat bees. This one has a nice blue cheek.,It's a Blue-cheeked Bee-eater.,And every one of these birds that makes the crossing,from India to East Africa,eats insects, large insects,,the size of dragonflies. Thank you very much.,(Applause)To understand the business of mythology,and what a Chief Belief Officer is supposed to do,,you have to hear a story,of Ganesha,,the elephant-headed god,who is the scribe of storytellers,,and his brother,,the athletic warlord of the gods,,Kartikeya.,The two brothers one day decided to go on a race,,three times around the world.,Kartikeya leapt on his peacock,and flew around the continents,and the mountains and the oceans.,He went around once,,he went around twice,,he went around thrice.,But his brother, Ganesha,,simply walked around his parents,once, twice, thrice,,and said, "I won.","How come?" said Kartikeya.,And Ganesha said,,"You went around 'the world.',I went around 'my world.'",What matters more? 
 If you understand the difference between 'the world' and 'my world,',you understand the difference between logos and mythos.,'The world' is objective,,logical, universal, factual,,scientific.,'My world' is subjective.,It's emotional. It's personal.,It's perceptions, thoughts, feelings, dreams.,It is the belief system that we carry.,It's the myth that we live in. 
 'The world' tells us how the world functions,,how the sun rises,,how we are born.,'My world' tells us why the sun rises,,why we were born.,Every culture is trying to understand itself:,"Why do we exist?",And every culture comes up with its own understanding of life,,its own customized version of mythology. 
 Culture is a reaction to nature,,and this understanding of our ancestors,is transmitted generation from generation,in the form of stories, symbols and rituals,,which are always indifferent to rationality.,And so, when you study it, you realize,that different people of the world,have a different understanding of the world.,Different people see things differently --,different viewpoints. 
 There is my world and there is your world,,and my world is always better than your world,,because my world, you see, is rational,and yours is superstition.,Yours is faith.,Yours is illogical.,This is the root of the clash of civilizations.,It took place, once, in 326 B.C.,on the banks of a river called the Indus,,now in Pakistan.,This river lends itself to India's name.,India. Indus. 
 Alexander, a young Macedonian,,met there what he called a "gymnosophist,",which means "the naked, wise man.",We don't know who he was.,Perhaps he was a Jain monk,,like Bahubali over here,,the Gomateshwara Bahubali,whose image is not far from Mysore.,Or perhaps he was just a yogi,who was sitting on a rock, staring at the sky,and the sun and the moon. 
 Alexander asked, "What are you doing?",and the gymnosophist answered,,"I'm experiencing nothingness.",Then the gymnosophist asked,,"What are you doing?",and Alexander said, "I am conquering the world.",And they both laughed.,Each one thought that the other was a fool.,The gymnosophist said, "Why is he conquering the world?,It's pointless.",And Alexander thought,,"Why is he sitting around, doing nothing?,What a waste of a life." 
 To understand this difference in viewpoints,,we have to understand,the subjective truth of Alexander --,his myth, and the mythology that constructed it.,Alexander's mother, his parents, his teacher Aristotle,told him the story of Homer's "Iliad.",They told him of a great hero called Achilles,,who, when he participated in battle, victory was assured,,but when he withdrew from the battle,,defeat was inevitable.,"Achilles was a man who could shape history,,a man of destiny,,and this is what you should be, Alexander.",That's what he heard. 
 "What should you not be?,You should not be Sisyphus,,who rolls a rock up a mountain all day,only to find the boulder rolled down at night.,Don't live a life which is monotonous,,mediocre, meaningless.,Be spectacular! --,like the Greek heroes,,like Jason, who went across the sea,with the Argonauts and fetched the Golden Fleece.,Be spectacular like Theseus,,who entered the labyrinth and killed the bull-headed Minotaur.,When you play in a race, win! --,because when you win, the exhilaration of victory,is the closest you will come to the ambrosia of the gods." 
 Because, you see, the Greeks believed,you live only once,,and when you die, you have to cross the River Styx.,And if you have lived an extraordinary life,,you will be welcomed to Elysium,,or what the French call "Champs-Élysées" --,(Laughter) --,the heaven of the heroes. 
 But these are not the stories that the gymnosophist heard.,He heard a very different story.,He heard of a man called Bharat,,after whom India is called Bhārata.,Bharat also conquered the world.,And then he went to the top-most peak,of the greatest mountain of the center of the world,called Meru.,And he wanted to hoist his flag to say,,"I was here first.",But when he reached the mountain peak,,he found the peak covered with countless flags,of world-conquerors before him,,each one claiming "'I was here first' ...,that's what I thought until I came here.",And suddenly, in this canvas of infinity,,Bharat felt insignificant.,This was the mythology of the gymnosophist. 
 You see, he had heroes, like Ram -- Raghupati Ram,and Krishna, Govinda Hari.,But they were not two characters on two different adventures.,They were two lifetimes of the same hero.,When the Ramayana ends the Mahabharata begins.,When Ram dies, Krishna is born.,When Krishna dies, eventually he will be back as Ram. 
 You see, the Indians also had a river,that separates the land of the living from the land of the dead.,But you don't cross it once.,You go to and fro endlessly.,It was called the Vaitarani.,You go again and again and again.,Because, you see,,nothing lasts forever in India, not even death.,And so, you have these grand rituals,where great images of mother goddesses are built,and worshiped for 10 days ...,And what do you do at the end of 10 days?,You dunk it in the river.,Because it has to end.,And next year, she will come back.,What goes around always comes around,,and this rule applies not just to man,,but also the gods.,You see, the gods,have to come back again and again and again,as Ram, as Krishna.,Not only do they live infinite lives,,but the same life is lived infinite times,till you get to the point of it all.,"Groundhog Day.",(Laughter) 
 Two different mythologies.,Which is right?,Two different mythologies, two different ways of looking at the world.,One linear, one cyclical.,One believes this is the one and only life.,The other believes this is one of many lives.,And so, the denominator of Alexander's life was one.,So, the value of his life was the sum total,of his achievements.,The denominator of the gymnosophist's life was infinity.,So, no matter what he did,,it was always zero.,And I believe it is this mythological paradigm,that inspired Indian mathematicians,to discover the number zero.,Who knows? 
 And that brings us to the mythology of business.,If Alexander's belief influenced his behavior,,if the gymnosophist's belief influences his behavior,,then it was bound to influence the business they were in.,You see, what is business,but the result of how the market behaves,and how the organization behaves?,And if you look at cultures around the world,,all you have to do is understand the mythology,and you will see how they behave and how they do business. 
 Take a look.,If you live only once, in one-life cultures around the world,,you will see an obsession with binary logic,,absolute truth, standardization,,absoluteness, linear patterns in design.,But if you look at cultures which have cyclical,and based on infinite lives, you will see a comfort with fuzzy logic,,with opinion,,with contextual thinking,,with everything is relative, sort of --,(Laughter),mostly.,(Laughter) 
 You look at art. Look at the ballerina,,how linear she is in her performance.,And then look at the Indian classical dancer,,the Kuchipudi dancer, the Bharatanatyam dancer,,curvaceous.,(Laughter) 
 And then look at business.,Standard business model:,vision, mission, values, processes.,Sounds very much like the journey through,the wilderness to the promised land,,with the commandments held by the leader.,And if you comply, you will go to heaven. 
 But in India there is no "the" promised land.,There are many promised lands,,depending on your station in society,,depending on your stage of life.,You see, businesses are not run as institutions,,by the idiosyncrasies of individuals.,It's always about taste.,It's always about my taste. 
 You see, Indian music, for example,,does not have the concept of harmony.,There is no orchestra conductor.,There is one performer standing there, and everybody follows.,And you can never replicate that performance twice.,It is not about documentation and contract.,It's about conversation and faith.,It's not about compliance. It's about setting,,getting the job done, by bending or breaking the rules --,just look at your Indian people around here,,you'll see them smile; they know what it is.,(Laughter),And then look at people who have done business in India,,you'll see the exasperation on their faces.,(Laughter),(Applause) 
 You see, this is what India is today. The ground reality,is based on a cyclical world view.,So, it's rapidly changing, highly diverse,,chaotic, ambiguous, unpredictable.,And people are okay with it.,And then globalization is taking place.,The demands of modern institutional thinking is coming in.,Which is rooted in one-life culture.,And a clash is going to take place,,like on the banks of the Indus.,It is bound to happen. 
 I have personally experienced it. I'm trained as a medical doctor.,I did not want to study surgery. Don't ask me why.,I love mythology too much.,I wanted to learn mythology. But there is nowhere you can study.,So, I had to teach it to myself.,And mythology does not pay, well, until now.,(Laughter),So, I had to take up a job. And I worked in the pharma industry.,And I worked in the healthcare industry.,And I worked as a marketing guy, and a sales guy,,and a knowledge guy, and a content guy, and a training guy.,I even was a business consultant, doing strategies and tactics.,And I would see the exasperation,between my American and European colleagues,,when they were dealing with India. 
 Example: Please tell us the process,to invoice hospitals.,Step A. Step B. Step C. Mostly.,(Laughter),How do you parameterize "mostly"?,How do you put it in a nice little software? You can't. 
 I would give my viewpoints to people.,But nobody was interested in listening to it,,you see, until I met Kishore Biyani of the Future group.,You see, he has established the largest retail chain, called Big Bazaar.,And there are more than 200 formats,,across 50 cities and towns of India.,And he was dealing with diverse and dynamic markets.,And he knew very intuitively,,that best practices,,developed in Japan and China and Europe and America,will not work in India.,He knew that institutional thinking doesn't work in India. Individual thinking does.,He had an intuitive understanding of the mythic structure of India. 
 So, he had asked me to be the Chief Belief Officer, and said,,"All I want to do is align belief.",Sounds so simple.,But belief is not measurable.,You can't measure it. You can't manage it.,So, how do you construct belief?,How do you enhance the sensitivity of people to Indian-ness.,Even if you are Indian, it is not very explicit, it is not very obvious. 
 So, I tried to work on the standard model of culture,,which is, develop stories, symbols and rituals.,And I will share one of the rituals with you.,You see it is based on the Hindu ritual of Darshan.,Hindus don't have the concept of commandments.,So, there is nothing right or wrong in what you do in life.,So, you're not really sure how you stand in front of God.,So, when you go to the temple, all you seek is an audience with God.,You want to see God.,And you want God to see you, and hence the gods have very large eyes,,large unblinking eyes,,sometimes made of silver,,so they look at you.,Because you don't know whether you're right or wrong, and so all you seek,is divine empathy.,"Just know where I came from, why I did the Jugaad.",(Laughter),"Why did I do the setting,,why I don't care for the processes. Just understand me, please." 
 And based on this, we created a ritual for leaders.,After a leader completes his training and is about to take over the store,,we blindfold him, we surround him with the stakeholders,,the customer, his family, his team, his boss.,You read out his KRA, his KPI, you give him the keys,,and then you remove the blindfold.,And invariably, you see a tear,,because the penny has dropped.,He realizes that to succeed,,he does not have to be a "professional,",he does not have to cut out his emotions,,he has to include all these people,in his world to succeed, to make them happy,,to make the boss happy, to make everyone happy.,The customer is happy, because the customer is God. 
 That sensitivity is what we need. Once this belief enters,,behavior will happen, business will happen.,And it has.,So, then we come back to Alexander,and to the gymnosophist.,And everybody asks me, "Which is the better way, this way or that way?",And it's a very dangerous question,,because it leads you to the path of fundamentalism and violence.,So, I will not answer the question.,What I will give you is an Indian answer,,the Indian head-shake.,(Laughter),(Applause) 
 Depending on the context,,depending on the outcome,,choose your paradigm.,You see, because both the paradigms are human constructions.,They are cultural creations,,not natural phenomena.,And so the next time you meet someone, a stranger,,one request:,Understand that you live in the subjective truth,,and so does he.,Understand it.,And when you understand it you will discover something spectacular.,You will discover that within infinite myths,lies the eternal truth.,Who sees it all?,Varuna has but a thousand eyes.,Indra, a hundred.,You and I, only two.,Thank you. Namaste.,(Applause)Please close your eyes,,and open your hands.,Now imagine what you could place in your hands:,an apple, maybe your wallet.,Now open your eyes.,What about a life? 
 What you see here is a premature baby.,He looks like he's resting peacefully, but in fact he's struggling to stay alive,because he can't regulate his own body temperature.,This baby is so tiny he doesn't have,enough fat on his body to stay warm.,Sadly, 20 million babies like this,are born every year around the world.,Four million of these babies die annually. 
 But the bigger problem is that the ones who do survive,grow up with severe, long-term health problems.,The reason is because in the first month of a baby's life,,its only job is to grow.,If it's battling hypothermia, its organs can't develop normally,,resulting in a range of health problems,from diabetes, to heart disease,,to low I.Q.,Imagine: Many of these problems could be prevented,if these babies were just kept warm. 
 That is the primary function of an incubator.,But traditional incubators require electricity,and cost up to 20 thousand dollars.,So, you're not going to find them in rural areas of developing countries.,As a result, parents resort to local solutions,like tying hot water bottles around their babies' bodies,,or placing them under light bulbs like the ones you see here --,methods that are both ineffective and unsafe.,I've seen this firsthand over and over again. 
 On one of my first trips to India, I met this young woman, Sevitha,,who had just given birth to a tiny premature baby, Rani.,She took her baby to the nearest village clinic,,and the doctor advised her to take Rani,to a city hospital so she could be placed in an incubator.,But that hospital was over four hours away,,and Sevitha didn't have the means to get there,,so her baby died. 
 Inspired by this story, and dozens of other similar stories like this,,my team and I realized what was needed was a local solution,,something that could work without electricity,,that was simple enough for a mother or a midwife to use,,given that the majority of births still take place in the home.,We needed something that was portable,,something that could be sterilized and reused across multiple babies,and something ultra-low-cost,,compared to the 20,000 dollars,that an incubator in the U.S. costs. 
 So, this is what we came up with.,What you see here looks nothing like an incubator.,It looks like a small sleeping bag for a baby.,You can open it up completely. It's waterproof.,There's no seams inside so you can sterilize it very easily.,But the magic is in this pouch of wax.,This is a phase-change material.,It's a wax-like substance with a melting point,of human body temperature, 37 degrees Celsius.,You can melt this simply using hot water,and then when it melts it's able to maintain one constant temperature,for four to six hours at a time,,after which you simply reheat the pouch.,So, you then place it into this little pocket back here,,and it creates a warm micro-environment,for the baby. 
 Looks simple, but we've reiterated this dozens of times,by going into the field to talk to doctors, moms and clinicians,to ensure that this really meets the needs of the local communities.,We plan to launch this product in India in 2010,,and the target price point will be 25 dollars,,less than 0.1 percent of the cost,of a traditional incubator. 
 Over the next five years we hope to save the lives,of almost a million babies.,But the longer-term social impact is a reduction in population growth.,This seems counterintuitive,,but turns out that as infant mortality is reduced,,population sizes also decrease,,because parents don't need to anticipate,that their babies are going to die.,We hope that the Embrace infant warmer,and other simple innovations like this,represent a new trend for the future of technology:,simple, localized, affordable solutions,that have the potential to make huge social impact. 
 In designing this we followed a few basic principles.,We really tried to understand the end user,,in this case, people like Sevitha.,We tried to understand the root of the problem,rather than being biased by what already exists.,And then we thought of the most simple solution we could,to address this problem.,In doing this, I believe we can truly bring technology to the masses.,And we can save millions of lives through the simple warmth of an Embrace.Salaam. Namaskar.,Good morning.,Given my TED profile, you might be expecting,that I'm going to speak to you about,the latest philanthropic trends --,the one that's currently got Wall Street,and the World Bank buzzing --,how to invest in women,,how to empower them, how to save them. 
 Not me.,I am interested in how women,are saving us.,They're saving us by redefining and re-imagining,a future that defies and blurs,accepted polarities,,polarities we've taken for granted for a long time,,like the ones between modernity and tradition,,First World and Third World,,oppression and opportunity.,In the midst of the daunting challenges,we face as a global community,,there's something about,this third way raga,that is making my heart sing.,What intrigues me most,is how women are doing this,,despite a set of paradoxes,that are both frustrating and fascinating. 
 Why is it that women are, on the one hand,,viciously oppressed by cultural practices,,and yet at the same time,,are the preservers of cultures in most societies?,Is the hijab or the headscarf,a symbol of submission,or resistance?,When so many women and girls,are beaten, raped, maimed,on a daily basis,in the name of all kinds of causes --,honor, religion, nationality --,what allows women to replant trees,,to rebuild societies,,to lead radical, non-violent movements,for social change?,Is it different women,who are doing the preserving and the radicalizing?,Or are they one and the same?,Are we guilty, as Chimamanda Adichie reminded us,at the TED conference in Oxford,,of assuming that there is a single story,of women's struggles for their rights,while there are, in fact, many?,And what, if anything,,do men have to do with it? 
 Much of my life has been a quest,to get some answers to these questions.,It's taken me across the globe,and introduced me to some amazing people.,In the process, I've gathered a few fragments,that help me shed some light on this puzzle.,Among those who've helped open my eyes,to a third way,are: a devout Muslim in Afghanistan,,a group of harmonizing lesbians in Croatia,and a taboo breaker in Liberia.,I'm indebted to them,,as I am to my parents,,who for some set of misdemeanors in their last life,,were blessed with three daughters in this one.,And for reasons equally unclear to me,,seem to be inordinately proud of the three of us. 
 I was born and raised here in India,,and I learned from an early age,to be deeply suspicious of the aunties and uncles,who would bend down, pat us on the head,and then say to my parents,with no problem at all,,"Poor things. You only have three daughters.,But you're young, you could still try again.",My sense of outrage,about women's rights,was brought to a boil when I was about 11.,My aunt, an incredibly articulate,and brilliant woman,,was widowed early.,A flock of relatives descended on her.,They took off her colorful sari.,They made her wear a white one.,They wiped her bindi off her forehead.,They broke her bangles.,Her daughter, Rani,,a few years older than me,,sat in her lap bewildered,,not knowing what had happened,to the confident woman,she once knew as her mother.,Late that night, I heard my mother,begging my father,,"Please do something Ramu. Can't you intervene?",And my father, in a low voice, muttering,,"I'm just the youngest brother, there's nothing I can do.,This is tradition.",That's the night I learned the rules,about what it means to be female in this world.,Women don't make those rules,,but they define us, and they define,our opportunities and our chances.,And men are affected by those rules too.,My father, who had fought in three wars,,could not save his own sister,from this suffering. 
 By 18,,under the excellent tutelage of my mother,,I was therefore, as you might expect,,defiantly feminist.,On the streets chanting,,"[Hindi],[Hindi],We are the women of India.,We are not flowers, we are sparks of change.",By the time I got to Beijing in 1995,,it was clear to me, the only way,to achieve gender equality,was to overturn centuries,of oppressive tradition.,Soon after I returned from Beijing,,I leapt at the chance to work for this wonderful organization,,founded by women,,to support women's rights organizations around the globe.,But barely six months into my new job,,I met a woman,who forced me to challenge all my assumptions.,Her name is Sakena Yacoobi. 
 She walked into my office,at a time when no one knew,where Afghanistan was in the United States.,She said to me, "It is not about the burka.",She was the most determined advocate,for women's rights I had ever heard.,She told me women were running underground schools,in her communities inside Afghanistan,,and that her organization, the Afghan Institute of Learning,,had started a school in Pakistan.,She said, "The first thing anyone who is a Muslim knows,is that the Koran requires,and strongly supports literacy.,The prophet wanted every believer,to be able to read the Koran for themselves.",Had I heard right?,Was a women's rights advocate,invoking religion?,But Sakena defies labels.,She always wears a headscarf,,but I've walked alongside with her on a beach,with her long hair flying in the breeze.,She starts every lecture with a prayer,,but she's a single, feisty,,financially independent woman,in a country where girls are married off at the age of 12. 
 She is also immensely pragmatic.,"This headscarf and these clothes," she says,,"give me the freedom to do what I need to do,to speak to those whose support and assistance,are critical for this work.,When I had to open the school in the refugee camp,,I went to see the imam.,I told him, 'I'm a believer, and women and children,in these terrible conditions,need their faith to survive.'",She smiles slyly.,"He was flattered.,He began to come twice a week to my center,because women could not go to the mosque.,And after he would leave,,women and girls would stay behind.,We began with a small literacy class,to read the Koran,,then a math class, then an English class, then computer classes.,In a few weeks, everyone in the refugee camp,was in our classes.",Sakena is a teacher,at a time when to educate women,is a dangerous business in Afghanistan. 
 She is on the Taliban's hit list.,I worry about her every time she travels across that country.,She shrugs when I ask her about safety.,"Kavita jaan, we cannot allow ourselves to be afraid.,Look at those young girls who go back to school,when acid is thrown in their face.",And I smile, and I nod,,realizing I'm watching women and girls,using their own religious traditions and practices,,turning them into instruments,of opposition and opportunity.,Their path is their own,and it looks towards an Afghanistan,that will be different. 
 Being different is something the women,of Lesbor in Zagreb, Croatia,know all too well.,To be a lesbian, a dyke,,a homosexual,in most parts of the world, including right here,in our country, India,,is to occupy a place of immense discomfort,and extreme prejudice.,In post-conflict societies like Croatia,,where a hyper-nationalism and religiosity,have created an environment unbearable,for anyone who might,be considered a social outcast.,So enter a group of out dykes,,young women who love the old music,that once spread across that region,from Macedonia to Bosnia,,from Serbia to Slovenia.,These folk singers met at college at a gender studies program.,Many are in their 20s, some are mothers.,Many have struggled to come out to their communities,,in families whose religious beliefs make it hard to accept,that their daughters are not sick,,just queer.,As Leah, one of the founders of the group, says,,"I like traditional music very much.,I also like rock and roll.,So Lesbor, we blend the two.,I see traditional music like a kind of rebellion,,in which people can really speak their voice,,especially traditional songs,from other parts of the former Yugoslav Republic.,After the war, lots of these songs were lost,,but they are a part of our childhood and our history,,and we should not forget them." 
 Improbably, this LGBT singing choir,has demonstrated how women,are investing in tradition to create change,,like alchemists turning discord into harmony.,Their repertoire includes,the Croatian national anthem,,a Bosnian love song,and Serbian duets.,And, Leah adds with a grin,,"Kavita, we especially are proud of our Christmas music,,because it shows we are open to religious practices,even though Catholic Church,hates us LGBT.",Their concerts draw from,their own communities, yes,,but also from an older generation:,a generation that might be,suspicious of homosexuality,,but is nostalgic for its own music and the past it represents.,One father, who had initially balked at his daughter,coming out in such a choir,,now writes songs for them.,In the Middle Ages, troubadours,would travel across the land,singing their tales and sharing their verses:,Lesbor travels through the Balkans like this,,singing, connecting people divided,by religion, nationality and language.,Bosnians, Croats and Serbs,find a rare shared space of pride in their history,,and Lesbor reminds them that,the songs one group often claims as theirs alone,really belong to them all. 
 (Singing) 
 Yesterday, Mallika Sarabhai showed us,that music can create a world,more accepting of difference,than the one we have been given.,The world Leymah Gbowee was given,was a world at war.,Liberia had been torn apart by civil strife for decades.,Leymah was not an activist, she was a mother of three.,But she was sick with worry:,She worried her son would be abducted,and taken off to be a child soldier,,she worried her daughters would be raped,,she worried for their lives.,One night, she had a dream.,She dreamt she and thousands of other women,ended the bloodshed.,The next morning at church, she asked others how they felt.,They were all tired of the fighting.,We need peace, and we need our leaders to know,we will not rest until there is peace.,Among Leymah's friends was a policewoman who was Muslim.,She promised to raise the issue with her community. 
 At the next Friday sermon,,the women who were sitting in the side room of the mosque,began to share their distress at the state of affairs.,"What does it matter?" they said, "A bullet doesn't distinguish,between a Muslim and a Christian.",This small group of women,,determined to bring an end to the war,,and they chose to use their traditions to make a point:,Liberian women usually wear,lots of jewelry and colorful clothing.,But no, for the protest, they dressed,all in white, no makeup.,As Leymah said, "We wore the white,saying we were out for peace.",They stood on the side of the road on which,Charles Taylor's motorcade passed every day.,They stood for weeks --,first just 10, then 20, then 50, then hundreds of women --,wearing white, singing, dancing,,saying they were out for peace. 
 Eventually, opposing forces in Liberia,were pushed to hold peace talks in Ghana.,The peace talks dragged on and on and on.,Leymah and her sisters had had enough.,With their remaining funds, they took,a small group of women down to the venue of the peace talks,and they surrounded the building.,In a now famous CNN clip,,you can see them sitting on the ground, their arms linked.,We know this in India. It's called a [Hindi].,Then things get tense.,The police are called in to physically remove the women.,As the senior officer approaches with a baton,,Leymah stands up with deliberation,,reaches her arms up over her head,,and begins, very slowly,,to untie her headdress that covers her hair.,You can see the policeman's face.,He looks embarrassed. He backs away.,And the next thing you know,,the police have disappeared.,Leymah said to me later,,"It's a taboo, you know, in West Africa.,If an older woman undresses in front of a man,because she wants to,,the man's family is cursed.",(Laughter),(Applause),She said, "I don't know if he did it because he believed,,but he knew we were not going to leave.,We were not going to leave until the peace accord was signed." 
 And the peace accord was signed.,And the women of Liberia,then mobilized in support of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf,,a woman who broke a few taboos herself,becoming the first elected woman head of state,in Africa in years.,When she made her presidential address,,she acknowledged these brave women of Liberia,who allowed her to win against a football star --,that's soccer for you Americans --,no less. 
 Women like Sakena and Leah,and Leymah,have humbled me and changed me,and made me realize that I should not be so quick,to jump to assumptions of any kind.,They've also saved me from my righteous anger,by offering insights into this third way.,A Filipina activist once said to me,,"How do you cook a rice cake?,With heat from the bottom and heat from the top.",The protests, the marches,,the uncompromising position that,women's rights are human rights, full stop.,That's the heat from the bottom.,That's Malcolm X and the suffragists,and gay pride parades.,But we also need the heat from the top.,And in most parts of the world,,that top is still,controlled by men. 
 So to paraphrase Marx: Women make change,,but not in circumstances of their own choosing.,They have to negotiate.,They have to subvert tradition that once silenced them,in order to give voice to new aspirations.,And they need allies from their communities.,Allies like the imam,,allies like the father who now writes songs,for a lesbian group in Croatia,,allies like the policeman who honored a taboo and backed away,,allies like my father,,who couldn't help his sister but has helped three daughters,pursue their dreams.,Maybe this is because feminism,,unlike almost every other social movement,,is not a struggle against a distinct oppressor --,it's not the ruling class,or the occupiers or the colonizers --,it's against a deeply held set of beliefs and assumptions,that we women, far too often,,hold ourselves. 
 And perhaps this is the ultimate gift of feminism,,that the personal is in fact the political.,So that, as Eleanor Roosevelt said once of human rights,,the same is true of gender equality:,that it starts in small places, close to home.,On the streets, yes,,but also in negotiations at the kitchen table,and in the marital bed,and in relationships between lovers and parents,and sisters and friends.,And then,you realize that by integrating,aspects of tradition and community,into their struggles,,women like Sakena and Leah and Leymah --,but also women like Sonia Gandhi here in India,and Michelle Bachelet in Chile,and Shirin Ebadi in Iran --,are doing something else.,They're challenging the very notion,of Western models of development.,They are saying, we don't have to be like you,to make change.,We can wear a sari or a hijab,or pants or a boubou,,and we can be party leaders and presidents,and human rights lawyers.,We can use our tradition to navigate change.,We can demilitarize societies,and pour resources, instead,,into reservoirs of genuine security. 
 It is in these little stories,,these individual stories,,that I see a radical epic being written,by women around the world.,It is in these threads,that are being woven into a resilient fabric,that will sustain communities,,that I find hope.,And if my heart is singing,,it's because in these little fragments,,every now and again, you catch a glimpse,of a whole, of a whole new world.,And she is definitely on her way. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)If you are a blind child in India,,you will very likely have to contend with,at least two big pieces of bad news.,The first bad news,is that the chances of getting treatment,are extremely slim to none,,and that's because most of the blindness,alleviation programs in the country,are focused on adults,,and there are very, very few hospitals,that are actually equipped to treat children.,In fact, if you were to be treated,,you might well end up being treated,by a person who has no medical credentials,as this case from Rajasthan illustrates.,This is a three-year-old orphan girl,who had cataracts.,So, her caretakers took her,to the village medicine man,,and instead of suggesting to the caretakers,that the girl be taken to a hospital,,the person decided to burn her abdomen,with red-hot iron bars,to drive out the demons.,The second piece of bad news,will be delivered to you,by neuroscientists, who will tell you,that if you are older than four or five years of age,,that even if you have your eye corrected,,the chances of your brain learning how to see,are very, very slim --,again, slim or none. 
 So when I heard these two things,,it troubled me deeply,,both because of personal reasons,and scientific reasons.,So let me first start with the personal reason.,It'll sound corny, but it's sincere.,That's my son, Darius.,As a new father,,I have a qualitatively different sense,of just how delicate babies are,,what our obligations are towards them,and how much love,we can feel towards a child.,I would move heaven and earth,in order to get treatment for Darius,,and for me to be told,that there might be other Dariuses,who are not getting treatment,,that's just viscerally wrong.,So that's the personal reason. 
 Scientific reason is that this notion,from neuroscience of critical periods --,that if the brain is older,than four or five years of age,,it loses its ability to learn --,that doesn't sit well with me,,because I don't think that idea,has been tested adequately.,The birth of the idea is from,David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel's work,,two researchers who were at Harvard,,and they got the Nobel Prize in 1981,for their studies of visual physiology,,which are remarkably beautiful studies,,but I believe some of their work,has been extrapolated,into the human domain prematurely.,So, they did their work with kittens,,with different kinds of deprivation regiments,,and those studies,,which date back to the '60s,,are now being applied to human children. 
 So I felt that I needed to do two things.,One: provide care,to children who are currently,being deprived of treatment.,That's the humanitarian mission.,And the scientific mission would be,to test the limits,of visual plasticity.,And these two missions, as you can tell,,thread together perfectly. One adds to the other;,in fact, one would be impossible without the other.,So, to implement,these twin missions,,a few years ago, I launched Project Prakash.,Prakash, as many of you know,,is the Sanskrit word for light,,and the idea is that,in bringing light into the lives of children,,we also have a chance,of shedding light on some of the,deepest mysteries of neuroscience.,And the logo -- even though it looks extremely Irish,,it's actually derived from,the Indian symbol of Diya, an earthen lamp.,The Prakash, the overall effort,has three components:,outreach, to identify children in need of care;,medical treatment; and in subsequent study.,And I want to show you a short video clip,that illustrates the first two components of this work. 
 This is an outreach station,conducted at a school for the blind. 
 (Text: Most of the children are profoundly and permanently blind ...) 
 Pawan Sinha: So, because this is a school for the blind,,many children have permanent conditions.,That's a case of microphthalmos,,which is malformed eyes,,and that's a permanent condition;,it cannot be treated.,That's an extreme of micropthalmos,called enophthalmos.,But, every so often, we come across children,who show some residual vision,,and that is a very good sign,that the condition might actually be treatable.,So, after that screening, we bring the children to the hospital.,That's the hospital we're working with in Delhi,,the Schroff Charity Eye Hospital.,It has a very well-equipped,pediatric ophthalmic center,,which was made possible in part,by a gift from the Ronald McDonald charity.,So, eating burgers actually helps. 
 (Text: Such examinations allow us to improve,eye-health in many children, and ...,... help us find children who can participate in Project Prakash.) 
 PS: So, as I zoom in to the eyes of this child,,you will see the cause of his blindness.,The whites that you see in the middle of his pupils,are congenital cataracts,,so opacities of the lens.,In our eyes, the lens is clear,,but in this child, the lens has become opaque,,and therefore he can't see the world.,So, the child is given treatment. You'll see shots of the eye.,Here's the eye with the opaque lens,,the opaque lens extracted,and an acrylic lens inserted.,And here's the same child,three weeks post-operation,,with the right eye open. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 So, even from that little clip, you can begin to get the sense,that recovery is possible,,and we have now,provided treatment to over 200 children,,and the story repeats itself.,After treatment, the child,gains significant functionality.,In fact, the story holds true,even if you have a person who got sight,after several years of deprivation.,We did a paper a few years ago,about this woman that you see on the right, SRD,,and she got her sight late in life,,and her vision is remarkable at this age.,I should add a tragic postscript to this --,she died two years ago,in a bus accident.,So, hers is just a truly inspiring story --,unknown, but inspiring story.,So when we started finding these results,,as you might imagine, it created quite a bit of stir,in the scientific and the popular press.,Here's an article in Nature,that profiled this work,,and another one in Time.,So, we were fairly convinced -- we are convinced --,that recovery is feasible,,despite extended visual deprivation. 
 The next obvious question to ask:,What is the process of recovery?,So, the way we study that is,,let's say we find a child who has light sensitivity.,The child is provided treatment,,and I want to stress that the treatment,is completely unconditional;,there is no quid pro quo.,We treat many more children then we actually work with.,Every child who needs treatment is treated.,After treatment, about every week,,we run the child,on a battery of simple visual tests,in order to see how their visual skills,are coming on line.,And we try to do this for as long as possible.,This arc of development,gives us unprecedented,and extremely valuable information,about how the scaffolding of vision,gets set up.,What might be the causal connections,between the early developing skills,and the later developing ones? 
 And we've used this general approach to study,many different visual proficiencies,,but I want to highlight one particular one,,and that is image parsing into objects.,So, any image of the kind that you see on the left,,be it a real image or a synthetic image,,it's made up of little regions,that you see in the middle column,,regions of different colors, different luminances.,The brain has this complex task,of putting together, integrating,,subsets of these regions,into something that's more meaningful,,into what we would consider to be objects,,as you see on the right.,And nobody knows how this integration happens,,and that's the question we asked with Project Prakash. 
 So, here's what happens,very soon after the onset of sight.,Here's a person who had gained sight just a couple of weeks ago,,and you see Ethan Myers, a graduate student from MIT,,running the experiment with him.,His visual-motor coordination is quite poor,,but you get a general sense,of what are the regions that he's trying to trace out.,If you show him real world images,,if you show others like him real world images,,they are unable to recognize most of the objects,because the world to them is over-fragmented;,it's made up of a collage, a patchwork,,of regions of different colors and luminances.,And that's what's indicated in the green outlines.,When you ask them,,"Even if you can't name the objects, just point to where the objects are,",these are the regions that they point to.,So the world is this complex,patchwork of regions.,Even the shadow on the ball,becomes its own object.,Interestingly enough,,you give them a few months,,and this is what happens. 
 Doctor: How many are these? 
 Patient: These are two things. 
 Doctor: What are their shapes? 
 Patient: Their shapes ...,This one is a circle,,and this,is a square. 
 PS: A very dramatic transformation has come about.,And the question is:,What underlies this transformation?,It's a profound question,,and what's even more amazing is how simple,the answer is.,The answer lies in motion,and that's what I want to show you in the next clip. 
 Doctor: What shape do you see here? 
 Patient: I can't make it out. 
 Doctor: Now? 
 Patient: Triangle. 
 Doctor: How many things are these?,Now, how many things are these? 
 Patient: Two. 
 Doctor: What are these things? 
 Patient: A square and a circle. 
 PS: And we see this pattern over and over again.,The one thing the visual system needs,in order to begin parsing the world,is dynamic information.,So the inference we are deriving from this,,and several such experiments,,is that dynamic information processing,,or motion processing,,serves as the bedrock for building,the rest of the complexity of visual processing;,it leads to visual integration,and eventually to recognition. 
 This simple idea has far reaching implications.,And let me just quickly mention two,,one, drawing from the domain of engineering,,and one from the clinic.,So, from the perspective of engineering,,we can ask: Goven that we know,that motion is so important for the human visual system,,can we use this as a recipe,for constructing machine-based vision systems,that can learn on their own, that don't need to be programmed,by a human programmer?,And that's what we're trying to do. 
 I'm at MIT, at MIT you need to apply,whatever basic knowledge you gain.,So we are creating Dylan,,which is a computational system,with an ambitious goal,of taking in visual inputs,of the same kind that a human child would receive,,and autonomously discovering:,What are the objects in this visual input?,So, don't worry about the internals of Dylan.,Here, I'm just going to talk about,how we test Dylan.,The way we test Dylan is by giving it,inputs, as I said, of the same kind,that a baby, or a child in Project Prakash would get.,But for a long time we couldn't quite figure out:,Wow can we get these kinds of video inputs?,So, I thought,,could we have Darius,serve as our babycam carrier,,and that way get the inputs that we feed into Dylan?,So that's what we did.,(Laughter),I had to have long conversations with my wife.,(Laughter),In fact, Pam, if you're watching this,,please forgive me. 
 So, we modified the optics of the camera,in order to mimic the baby's visual acuity.,As some of you might know,,babyies are born pretty much legally blind.,Their acuity -- our acuity is 20/20;,babies' acuity is like 20/800,,so they are looking at the world,in a very, very blurry fashion.,Here's what a baby-cam video looks like. 
 (Laughter),(Applause) 
 Thankfully, there isn't any audio,to go with this.,What's amazing is that working with such,highly degraded input,,the baby, very quickly, is able,to discover meaning in such input.,But then two or three days afterward,,babies begin to pay attention,to their mother's or their father's face.,How does that happen? We want Dylan to be able to do that,,and using this mantra of motion,,Dylan actually can do that.,So, given that kind of video input,,with just about six or seven minutes worth of video,,Dylan can begin to extract patterns,that include faces.,So, it's an important demonstration,of the power of motion. 
 The clinical implication, it comes from the domain of autism.,Visual integration has been associated with autism,by several researchers.,When we saw that, we asked:,Could the impairment in visual integration,be the manifestation of something underneath,,of dynamic information processing deficiencies in autism?,Because, if that hypothesis were to be true,,it would have massive repercussions in our understanding,of what's causing the many different aspects,of the autism phenotype. 
 What you're going to see are,video clips of two children -- one neurotypical,,one with autism, playing Pong.,So, while the child is playing Pong, we are tracking where they're looking.,In red are the eye movement traces.,This is the neurotypical child, and what you see,is that the child is able to make cues,of the dynamic information,to predict where the ball is going to go.,Even before the ball gets to a place,,the child is already looking there.,Contrast this with a child,with autism playing the same game.,Instead of anticipating,,the child always follows where the ball has been.,The efficiency of the use,of dynamic information,seems to be significantly compromised in autism.,So we are pursuing this line of work,and hopefully we'll have,more results to report soon. 
 Looking ahead, if you think of this disk,as representing all of the children,we've treated so far,,this is the magnitude of the problem.,The red dots are the children we have not treated.,So, there are many, many more children who need to be treated,,and in order to expand the scope of the project,,we are planning on launching,The Prakash Center for Children,,which will have a dedicated pediatric hospital,,a school for the children we are treating,and also a cutting-edge research facility.,The Prakash Center will integrate health care,,education and research in a way,that truly creates the whole,to be greater than the sum of the parts. 
 So, to summarize: Prakash, in its five years of existence,,it's had an impact in multiple areas,,ranging from basic neuroscience,plasticity and learning in the brain,,to clinically relevant hypotheses like in autism,,the development of autonomous machine vision systems,,education of the undergraduate and graduate students,,and most importantly in the alleviation,of childhood blindness.,And for my students and I, it's been,just a phenomenal experience,because we have gotten to do interesting research,,while at the same time,helping the many children that we have worked with. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)We grew up,interacting with the physicalnobjects around us.,There are an enormous number of themnthat we use every day.,Unlike most of our computing devices,,these objects are much more fun to use.,When you talk about objects,,one other thing automaticallyncomes attached to that thing,,and that is gestures:,how we manipulate these objects,,how we use these objects in everyday life.,We use gestures not only to interactnwith these objects,,but we also use themnto interact with each other.,A gesture of "Namaste!",nmaybe, to respect someone, or maybe,,in India I don't need to teachna kid that this means,"four runs" in cricket.,It comes as a partnof our everyday learning. 
 So, I am very interested,nfrom the beginning,,how our knowledgenabout everyday objects and gestures,,and how we use these objects,,can be leveraged to our interactionsnwith the digital world.,Rather than using a keyboard and mouse,,why can I not use my computer,in the same way that I interactnin the physical world? 
 So, I started this explorationnaround eight years back,,and it literally startednwith a mouse on my desk.,Rather than using it for my computer,nI actually opened it.,Most of you might be awarenthat, in those days,,the mouse used to come with a ball inside,,and there were two rollers,that actually guide the computernwhere the ball is moving,,and, accordingly,nwhere the mouse is moving.,So, I was interested in these two rollers,,and I actually wanted more, so I borrowednanother mouse from a friend --,never returned to him --,and I now had four rollers.,Interestingly, what I didnwith these rollers is,,basically, I took them off of these mousesnand then put them in one line.,It had some stringsnand pulleys and some springs.,What I got is basicallyna gesture-interface device,that actually actsnas a motion-sensing device,made for two dollars.,So, here, whatever movementnI do in my physical world,is actually replicatedninside the digital world,just using this small devicenthat I made, around eight years back,,in 2000. 
 Because I was interestednin integrating these two worlds,,I thought of sticky notes.,I thought, "Why can I not connect,the normal interfacenof a physical sticky note,to the digital world?",A message writtennon a sticky note to my mom,,on paper,,can come to an SMS,,or maybe a meeting reminder,automatically syncsnwith my digital calendar --,a to-do list that automaticallynsyncs with you.,But you can also searchnin the digital world,,or maybe you can write a query, saying,,"What is Dr. Smith's address?",and this small systemnactually prints it out --,so it actually acts like a paperninput-output system,,just made out of paper. 
 In another exploration,,I thought of making a pennthat can draw in three dimensions.,So, I implemented this pennthat can help designers and architects,not only think in three dimensions,,but they can actually draw,,so that it's more intuitivento use that way. 
 Then I thought,n"Why not make a Google Map,,but in the physical world?",Rather than typing a keywordnto find something,,I put my objects on top of it.,If I put a boarding pass, it will show menwhere the flight gate is.,A coffee cup will shownwhere you can find more coffee,,or where you can trash the cup. 
 So, these were somenof the earlier explorations I did,because the goal was to connectnthese two worlds seamlessly.,Among all these experiments,,there was one thing in common:,I was trying to bringna part of the physical world,to the digital world.,I was taking some part of the objects,,or any of the intuitiveness of real life,,and bringing them to the digital world,,because the goal was to makenour computing interfaces more intuitive. 
 But then I realized that we humansnare not actually interested in computing.,What we are interested in is information.,We want to know about things.,We want to know aboutndynamic things going around. 
 So I thought, around last year --nin the beginning of the last year --,I started thinking, "Why can I not takenthis approach in the reverse way?",Maybe, "How about I take my digital world,and paint the physical worldnwith that digital information?",Because pixels are actually, right now,nconfined in these rectangular devices,that fit in our pockets.,Why can I not remove this confine,and take that to my everydaynobjects, everyday life,so that I don't neednto learn the new language,for interacting with those pixels? 
 So, in order to realize this dream,,I actually thought of puttingna big-size projector on my head.,I think that's why this is calledna head-mounted projector, isn't it?,I took it very literally,,and took my bike helmet,,put a little cut over there so thatnthe projector actually fits nicely.,So now, what I can do --,I can augment the world around menwith this digital information. 
 But later,,I realized that I actuallynwanted to interact,with those digital pixels, also.,So I put a small camera over therenthat acts as a digital eye.,Later, we moved to a much better,,consumer-oriented pendant version of that,,that many of you now knownas the SixthSense device. 
 But the most interesting thingnabout this particular technology,is that you can carrynyour digital world with you,wherever you go.,You can start using any surface,nany wall around you,,as an interface.,The camera is actually trackingnall your gestures.,Whatever you're doing with your hands,,it's understanding that gesture.,And, actually, if you see,nthere are some color markers,that in the beginning versionnwe are using with it.,You can start painting on any wall.,You stop by a wall,nand start painting on that wall.,But we are not only trackingnone finger, here.,We are giving you the freedomnof using all of both of your hands,,so you can actually use both of your handsnto zoom into or zoom out,of a map just by pinching all present.,The camera is actually doing --njust, getting all the images --,is doing the edge recognitionnand also the color recognition,and so many other small algorithmsnare going on inside.,So, technically,nit's a little bit complex,,but it gives you an output which is morenintuitive to use, in some sense. 
 But I'm more excited that you cannactually take it outside.,Rather than getting your cameranout of your pocket,,you can just do the gesturenof taking a photo,,and it takes a photo for you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you.,And later I can find a wall, anywhere,,and start browsing those photos,or maybe, "OK, I want to modifynthis photo a little bit,and send it as an email to a friend.",So, we are looking for an era,where computing will actually mergenwith the physical world.,And, of course,nif you don't have any surface,,you can start using your palmnfor simple operations.,Here, I'm dialing a phone numbernjust using my hand.,The camera is actually notnonly understanding your hand movements,,but, interestingly,,is also able to understand what objectsnyou are holding in your hand. 
 For example, in this case,,the book cover is matched,with so many thousands,nor maybe millions of books online,,and checking out which book it is.,Once it has that information,,it finds out more reviews about that,,or maybe New York Timesnhas a sound overview on that,,so you can actually hear,non a physical book,,a review as sound. 
 (Video) Famous talknat Harvard University -- 
 This was Obama's visit last week to MIT. 
 (Video) And particularly I wantnto thank two outstanding MIT -- 
 Pranav Mistry: So, I was seeingnthe live [video] of his talk,,outside, on just a newspaper.,Your newspaper will show younlive weather information,rather than having it updated.,You have to check your computernin order to do that, right? 
 (Applause) 
 When I'm going back,nI can just use my boarding pass,to check how much my flightnhas been delayed,,because at that particular time,,I'm not feeling like opening my iPhone,,and checking out a particular icon.,And I think this technologynwill not only change the way -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Yes.,It will change the waynwe interact with people, also,,not only the physical world.,The fun part is, I'm goingnto the Boston metro,,and playing a pong game inside the trainnon the ground, right? 
 (Laughter) 
 And I think the imaginationnis the only limit,of what you can think of,when this kind of technologynmerges with real life. 
 But many of you argue, actually,,that all of our work is notnonly about physical objects.,We actually do lotsnof accounting and paper editing,and all those kinds of things;nwhat about that?,And many of you are excitednabout the next-generation tablet computers,to come out in the market. 
 So, rather than waiting for that,,I actually made my own,njust using a piece of paper.,So, what I did herenis remove the camera --,All the webcam cameras havena microphone inside the camera.,I removed the microphone from that,,and then just pinched that --,like I just made a clipnout of the microphone --,and clipped that to a piece of paper,nany paper that you found around.,So now the sound of the touch,is getting me when exactlynI'm touching the paper.,But the camera is actually trackingnwhere my fingers are moving. 
 You can of course watch movies. 
 (Video) Good afternoon.nMy name is Russell,,and I am a WildernessnExplorer in Tribe 54." 
 PM: And you can of course play games. 
 (Car engine) 
 Here, the camera is actually understandingnhow you're holding the paper,and playing a car-racing game. 
 (Applause) 
 Many of you already must haventhought, OK, you can browse.,Yeah. Of course you cannbrowse to any websites,or you can do all sortsnof computing on a piece of paper,wherever you need it.,So, more interestingly,,I'm interested in how we canntake that in a more dynamic way.,When I come back to my desk,nI can just pinch that information,back to my desktop,so I can use my full-size computer. 
 (Applause) 
 And why only computers?nWe can just play with papers.,Paper world is interesting to play with.,Here, I'm taking a part of a document,,and putting over here a second partnfrom a second place,,and I'm actually modifying the informationnthat I have over there.,Yeah. And I say, "OK, this looks nice,nlet me print it out, that thing.",So I now have a print-out of that thing.,So the workflow is more intuitive,,the way we used to do itnmaybe 20 years back,,rather than now switchingnbetween these two worlds. 
 So, as a last thought,,I think that integratingninformation to everyday objects,will not only help us to get ridnof the digital divide,,the gap between these two worlds,,but will also help us, in some way,,to stay human,,to be more connectednto our physical world.,And it will actually help usnnot end up being machines,sitting in front of other machines. 
 That's all. Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: So, Pranav,nfirst of all, you're a genius.,This is incredible, really.,What are you doing with this?nIs there a company being planned?,Or is this research forever, or what? 
 Pranav Mistry: So, there arenlots of companies,,sponsor companies of Media Labninterested in taking this ahead,in one or another way.,Companies like mobile-phone operators,want to take this in a different waynthan the NGOs in India,,thinking, "Why can we onlynhave 'Sixth Sense'?,We should have a 'Fifth Sense'nfor missing-sense people who cannot speak.,This technology can be used for themnto speak out in a different way,maybe a speaker system." 
 CA: What are your own plans?nAre you staying at MIT,,or are you going to donsomething with this? 
 PM: I'm trying to make thisnmore available to people,so that anyone can developntheir own SixthSense device,,because the hardware is actuallynnot that hard to manufacture,or hard to make your own.,We will provide all the open sourcensoftware for them,,maybe starting next month. 
 CA: Open source? Wow. 
 (Applause) 
 CA: Are you going to come back to Indianwith some of this, at some point? 
 PM: Yeah. Yes, yes, of course. 
 CA: What are your plans? MIT? India?,How are you going to splitnyour time going forward? 
 PM: There is a lot of energy here.nLots of learning.,All of this work that you have seennis all about my learning in India.,And now, if you see, it's more aboutnthe cost-effectiveness:,this system costs you $300,compared to the $20,000 surface tables,nor anything like that.,Or maybe even the $2 mouse gesture systemnat that time was costing around $5,000?,I showed that, at a conference,nto President Abdul Kalam, at that time,,and then he said, "OK, we should use thisnin Bhabha Atomic Research Centre,for some use of that.",So I'm excited about how I can bringnthe technology to the masses,rather than just keeping that technologynin the lab environment. 
 (Applause) 
 CA: Based on the people we've seen at TED,,I would say you're trulynone of the two or three,best inventors in the world right now.,It's an honor to have you at TED.,Thank you so much.,That's fantastic. 
 (Applause)I want you to put off your preconceptions,,your preconceived fears and thoughts about reptiles.,Because that is the only way I'm going to get my story across to you.,And by the way, if I come across as a sort of,rabid, hippie conservationist,,it's purely a figment of your imagination.,(Laughter) 
 Okay. We are actually the first species on Earth,to be so prolific to actually threaten our own survival.,And I know we've all seen images enough to make us numb,,of the tragedies that we're perpetrating on the planet.,We're kind of like greedy kids, using it all up, aren't we?,And today is a time for me to talk to you about water.,It's not only because we like to drink lots of it,,and its marvelous derivatives, beer, wine, etc.,And, of course, watch it fall from the sky,and flow in our wonderful rivers,,but for several other reasons as well. 
 When I was a kid, growing up in New York,,I was smitten by snakes, the same way most kids are,smitten by tops, marbles, cars, trains, cricket balls.,And my mother, brave lady,,was partly to blame,,taking me to the New York Natural History Museum,,buying me books on snakes,,and then starting this infamous career of mine,,which has culminated in,of course, arriving in India 60 years ago,,brought by my mother, Doris Norden,,and my stepfather, Rama Chattopadhyaya. 
 It's been a roller coaster ride.,Two animals, two iconic reptiles,really captivated me very early on.,One of them was the remarkable gharial.,This crocodile, which grows to almost 20 feet long,in the northern rivers,,and this charismatic snake, the king cobra.,What my purpose of the talk today really is,,is to sort of indelibly scar your minds,with these charismatic and majestic creatures.,Because this is what you will take away from here,,a reconnection with nature, I hope. 
 The king cobra is quite remarkable for several reasons.,What you're seeing here is very recently shot images,in a forest nearby here,,of a female king cobra making her nest.,Here is a limbless animal, capable of gathering a huge mound of leaves,,and then laying her eggs inside,,to withstand 5 to 10 [meters of rainfall],,in order that the eggs can incubate over the next 90 days,,and hatch into little baby king cobras.,So, she protects her eggs,,and after three months,,the babies finally do hatch out.,A majority of them will die, of course. There is very high mortality,in little baby reptiles who are just 10 to 12 inches long. 
 My first experience with king cobras was in '72,at a magical place called Agumbe,,in Karnataka, this state.,And it is a marvelous rain forest.,This first encounter,was kind of like the,Maasai boy who kills the lion to become a warrior.,It really changed my life totally.,And it brought me straight into the conservation fray.,I ended up starting this research,and education station in Agumbe,,which you are all of course invited to visit. 
 This is basically a base wherein,we are trying to gather and learn,virtually everything about the biodiversity,of this incredibly complex forest system,,and try to hang on to what's there,,make sure the water sources are protected and kept clean,,and of course, having a good time too.,You can almost hear the drums,throbbing back in that little cottage where we stay when we're there.,It was very important for us to get through to the people.,And through the children is usually the way to go.,They are fascinated with snakes. They haven't got,that steely thing that you end up,either fearing or hating or despising or loathing them in some way.,They are interested.,And it really works to start with them.,This gives you an idea of the size of some of these snakes. 
 This is an average size king cobra, about 12 feet long.,And it actually crawled into somebody's bathroom,,and was hanging around there for two or three days.,The people of this part of India,worship the king cobra.,And they didn't kill it. They called us to catch it.,Now we've caught more than 100 king cobras,over the last three years,,and relocated them in nearby forests. 
 But in order to find out the real secrets of these creatures,[it was necessary] for us to actually insert,a small radio transmitter inside [each] snake.,Now we are able to follow them and find out their secrets,,where the babies go after they hatch,,and remarkable things like this you're about to see.,This was just a few days ago in Agumbe.,I had the pleasure of being close to this large king cobra,who had caught a venomous pit viper.,And it does it in such a way that it doesn't get bitten itself.,And king cobras feed only on snakes.,This [little snake] was kind of a tid-bit for it,,what we'd call a "vadai" or a donut or something like that.,(Laughter) 
 Usually they eat something a bit larger.,In this case a rather strange and inexplicable,activity happened over the last breeding season,,wherein a large male king cobra actually grabbed a female king cobra,,didn't mate with it, actually killed it and swallowed it.,We're still trying to explain and come to terms with,what is the evolutionary advantage of this. 
 But they do also a lot of other remarkable things.,This is again, something [we were able to see] by virtue of the fact,that we had a radio transmitter in one of the snakes.,This male snake, 12 feet long, met another male king cobra.,And they did this incredible ritual combat dance.,It's very much like the rutting of mammals, including humans,,you know, sorting out our differences, but gentler, no biting allowed.,It's just a wresting match,,but a remarkable activity. 
 Now, what are we doing with all this information?,What's the point of all this?,Well, the king cobra is literally,a keystone species in these rainforests.,And our job is to convince the authorities,that these forests have to be protected.,And this is one of the ways we do it,,by learning as much as we can,about something so remarkable and so iconic in the rainforests there,,in order to help protect trees, animals,and of course the water sources. 
 You've all heard, perhaps, of Project Tiger,which started back in the early '70s,,which was, in fact, a very dynamic time for conservation.,We were piloted, I could say,,by a highly autocratic stateswoman,,but who also had an incredible passion for environment.,And this is the time when Project Tiger emerged.,And, just like Project Tiger,,our activities with the king cobra,is to look at a species of animal,so that we protect its habitat and everything within it.,So, the tiger is the icon.,And now the king cobra is a new one. 
 All the major rivers in south India,are sourced in the Western Ghats,,the chain of hills running along the west coast of India.,It pours out millions of gallons every hour,,and supplies drinking water to at least 300 million people,,and washes many, many babies,,and of course feeds many, many animals,,both domestic and wild,,produces thousands of tons of rice. 
 And what do we do? How do we respond to this?,Well, basically, we dam it, we pollute it,,we pour in pesticides, weedicides, fungicides.,You drink it in peril of your life.,And the thing is, it's not just big industry.,It's not misguided river engineers,who are doing all this; it's us.,It seems that our citizens find the best way to dispose of garbage,are in water sources.,Okay. Now we're going north, very far north. 
 North central India, the Chambal River,is where we have our base.,This is the home of the gharial, this incredible crocodile.,It is an animal which has been on the Earth,for just about 100 million years.,It survived even during the time that the dinosaurs died off.,It has remarkable features.,Even though it grows to 20 feet long,,since it eats only fish it's not dangerous to human beings.,It does have big teeth, however,,and it's kind of hard to convince people,if an animal has big teeth, that it's a harmless creature. 
 But we, actually, back in the early '70s,,did surveys,,and found that gharial were extremely rare.,In fact, if you see the map,,the range of their original habitat,was all the way from the Indus in Pakistan,to the Irrawaddy in Burma.,And now it's just limited to a couple of spots,in Nepal and India.,So, in fact at this point,there are only 200 breeding gharial left in the wild.,So, starting in the mid-'70s,when conservation was at the fore,,we were actually able to start projects which were,basically government supported,to collect eggs from the wild from the few remaining nests,and release 5,000 baby gharial,back to the wild.,And pretty soon we were seeing sights like this.,I mean, just incredible to see bunches of gharial,basking on the river again. 
 But complacency does have a tendency to breed contempt.,And, sure enough, with all the other pressures on the river,,like sand mining, for example,,very, very heavy cultivation all the way down to the river's edge,,not allowing the animals to breed anymore,,we're looking at,even more problems building up for the gharial,,despite the early good intentions.,Their nests hatching along the riverside,producing hundreds of hatchlings. It's just an amazing sight.,This was actually just taken last year.,But then the monsoon arrives,,and unfortunately downriver there is always a dam or,there is always a barrage,,and, shoop, they get washed down to their doom. 
 Luckily there is still a lot of interest.,My pals in the Crocodile Specialist Group of the IUCN,,the [Madras Crocodile Bank], an NGO,,the World Wildlife Fund,,the Wildlife Institute of India, State Forest Departments,,and the Ministry of Environment, we all work together on stuff.,But it's possibly, and definitely not enough.,For example, in the winter of 2007 and 2008,,there was this incredible die-off of gharial, in the Chambal River.,Suddenly dozens of gharial appearing on the river, dead.,Why? How could it happen? 
 This is a relatively clean river.,The Chambal, if you look at it, has clear water.,People scoop water out of the Chambal and drink it,,something you wouldn't do in most north Indian rivers.,So, in order to try to find out the answer to this,,we got veterinarians from all over the world,working with Indian vets to try to figure out what was happening.,I was there for a lot of the necropsies on the riverside.,And we actually looked through,all their organs and tried to figure out what was going on.,And it came down to something called gout,,which, as a result of kidney breakdown,is actually uric acid crystals throughout the body,,and worse in the joints,,which made the gharial unable to swim.,And it's a horribly painful death. 
 Just downriver from the Chambal is the,filthy Yamuna river, the sacred Yamuna river.,And I hate to be so ironic and sarcastic about it,but it's the truth. It's just one of the filthiest cesspools you can imagine.,It flows down through Delhi, Mathura, Agra,,and gets just about every bit of effluent you can imagine.,So, it seemed that the toxin that was killing the gharial,was something in the food chain,,something in the fish they were eating.,And, you know, once a toxin is in the food chain,everything is affected, including us. 
 Because these rivers are the lifeblood of people all along their course.,In order to try to answer some of these questions,,we again turn to technology,,to biological technology, in this case,,again, telemetry, putting radios on 10 gharial,,and actually following their movements. They're being watched,everyday as we speak, to try to find out,what this mysterious toxin is. 
 The Chambal river is an absolutely incredible place.,It's a place that's famous to a lot of you who know,about the bandits, the dacoits,who used to work up there. And there still are quite a few around.,But Poolan Devi was one [of them]. Which actually Shekhar Kapur,made an incredible movie, "The Bandit Queen," which I urge you to see.,You'll get to see the incredible [Chambal] landscape as well. 
 But, again, heavy fishing pressures.,This is one of the last repositories of the,Ganges river dolphin,,various species of turtles,,thousands of migratory birds,,and fishing is causing problems like this.,And now [these] new elements of human intolerance,for river creatures like the gharial,means that if they don't drown in the net,,then they simply cut their beaks off.,Animals like the Ganges river dolphin,which is just down to a few left,,and it is also critically endangered. 
 So, who is next? Us?,Because we are all dependent on these water sources.,So, we all know about the Narmada river,,the tragedies of dams, the tragedies of huge projects,which displace people and wreck river systems,without providing livelihoods.,And development just basically going berserk,,for a double figure growth index, basically.,So, we're not sure where this story is going to end,,whether it's got a happy or sad ending.,And climate change is certainly going,to turn all of our theories and predictions on their heads.,We're still working hard at it.,We've got a lot of a good team of people working up there. 
 And the thing is, you know, the decision makers,,the folks in power,,they're up in their bungalows and so on in Delhi,,in the city capitals. They are all supplied with plenty of water. It's cool.,But out on the rivers there are still millions of people,who are in really bad shape.,And it's a bleak future for them.,So, we have our Ganges and Yamuna cleanup project.,We've spent hundreds of millions of dollars on it,,and nothing to show for it. Incredible.,So, people talk about political will.,During the die-off of the gharial we did galvanize a lot of action.,Government cut through all the red tape,,we got foreign vets on it. It was great.,So, we can do it.,But if you stroll down to the Yamuna,or to the Gomati in Lucknow,,or to the Adyar river in Chennai,,or the Mula-Mutha river in Pune,,just see what we're capable of doing to a river. It's sad. 
 But I think the final note really is,that we can do it.,The corporates, the artists, the wildlife nuts,,the good old everyday folks,can actually bring these rivers back.,And the final word is,that there is a king cobra looking over our shoulders.,And there is a gharial looking at us from the river.,And these are powerful water totems.,And they are going to disturb our dreams until we do the right thing.,Namaste.,(Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: Thanks, Rom. Thanks a lot.,You know, most people are terrified of snakes.,And there might be quite a few people here who would be,very glad to see the last king cobra bite the dust.,Do you have those conversations with people?,How do you really get them to care? 
 Romulus Whitaker: I take the sort of humble approach,,I guess you could say. I don't say that snakes are huggable exactly.,It's not like the teddy bear.,But I sort of -- there is an innocence in these animals.,And when the average person looks at a cobra,going "Ssssss!" like that, they say, "My god,,look at that angry, dangerous creature.",I look at it as a creature who is totally frightened,of something so dangerous as a human being.,And that is the truth. And that's what I try to get out.,(Applause) 
 CA: Now, incredible footage you showed of the viper being killed.,You were saying that that hasn't been filmed before. 
 RW: Yes, this is actually the first time anyone of us knew about it, for one thing.,As I said, it's just like a little snack for him, you know?,Usually they eat larger snakes like rat snakes,,or even cobras.,But this guy who we're following right now is in the deep jungle.,Whereas other king cobras,very often come into the human interface,,you know, the plantations, to find big rat snakes and stuff.,This guy specializes in pit vipers.,And the guy who is working there with them,,he's from Maharashtra, he said, "I think he's after the nusha.",(Laughter),Now, the nusha means the high.,Whenever he eats the pit viper he gets this little venom rush.,(Laughter) 
 CA: Thanks Rom. Thank you.,(Applause)The anger in me against corruption,made me to make a big career change,last year, becoming a full-time practicing lawyer.,My experiences over the last 18 months,,as a lawyer, has seeded in me,a new entrepreneurial idea,,which I believe is indeed,worth spreading.,So, I share it with all of you here today,,though the idea itself is getting crystallized,and I'm still writing up the business plan.,Of course it helps that fear of public failure,diminishes as the number of ideas,which have failed increases. 
 I've been a huge fan of enterprise and entrepreneurship,since 1993.,I've explored, experienced,,and experimented enterprise,and capitalism to my heart's content.,I built, along with my two brothers,,the leading real estate company in my home state, Kerala,,and then worked professionally,with two of India's biggest businessmen,,but in their startup enterprises.,In 2003, when I stepped out of the pure play capitalistic sector,to work on so-called social sector issues,,I definitely did not have any grand strategy,or plan to pursue and find,for-profit solutions,to addressing pressing public issues. 
 When life brought about a series,of death and near-death experiences,within my close circle,,which highlighted the need,for an emergency medical response service in India,,similar to 911 in USA.,To address this, I, along with four friends,,founded Ambulance Access for All,,to promote life-support ambulance services in India.,For those from the developing world,,there is nothing, absolutely nothing new in this idea.,But as we envisioned it,,we had three key goals:,Providing world-class life support ambulance service,which is fully self-sustainable from its own revenue streams,,and universally accessible,to anyone in a medical emergency,,irrespective of the capability to pay.,The service which grew out of this,,Dial 1298 for Ambulance,,with one ambulance in 2004,,now has a hundred-plus ambulances in three states,,and has transported over 100,000 patients,and victims since inception. 
 The service is -- (Applause),fully self-sustainable from its own revenues,,without accessing any public funds,,and the cross-subsidy model actually works,,where the rich pays higher, poor pays lower,,and the accident victim is getting the service free of charge.,The service responded effectively,and efficiently,,during the unfortunate,26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.,And as you can see from the visuals,,the service was responding and rescuing,victims from the incident locations,even before the police could cordon off,the incident locations,and formally confirm it as a terror strike.,We ended up being the first medical response team,in every incident location,and transported 125 victims,,saving life. 
 (Applause) 
 In tribute and remembrance,of 26/11 attacks,over the last one year,,we have actually helped a Pakistani NGO,,Aman Foundation,,to set up a self-sustainable life support ambulance service,in Karachi, facilitated by Acumen Fund. 
 (Applause) 
 It's a small message from us,,in our own small way,to the enemies of humanity,,of Islam, of South Asia,,of India, and of Pakistan,,that humanity will continue to bloom,,irrespective of such dastardly attacks.,Since then I've also co-founded two other social enterprises.,One is Education Access for All,,setting up schools in small-town India.,And the other is Moksha-Yug Access,,which is integrating rural supply chain,on the foundations of self-help group-based microfinance.,I guess we seem to be doing at least a few things right.,Because diligent investors and venture funds,have committed over 7.5 million dollars in funding.,With the significance being these funds have come in,as a QT capital, not as grant or as philanthropy. 
 Now I come back to the idea of the new social enterprise,that I'm exploring.,Corruption, bribes, and lack of transparency.,You may be surprised to know,that eight speakers yesterday,actually mentioned these terms in their talks.,Bribes and corruption have both a demand and a supply side,,with the supply side being mostly of,greedy corporate unethical businesses,and hapless common man.,And the demand side being mostly politicians,,bureaucrats and those who have discretionary power,vested with them. 
 According to World Bank estimate,,one trillion dollars is paid in bribes,every year, worsening the condition,of the already worse off.,Yet, if you analyze the common man,,he or she does not wake up every day and say,,"Hmm, let me see who I can pay a bribe to today.",or, "Let me see who I can corrupt today.",Often it is the constraining or the back-to-the-wall situation,that the hapless common man finds himself or herself in,that leads him to pay a bribe.,In the modern day world, where time is premium,and battle for subsistence is unimaginably tough,,the hapless common man,simply gives in and pays the bribe just to get on with life. 
 Now, let me ask you another question.,Imagine you are being asked to pay a bribe,in your day-to-day life to get something done.,What do you do? Of course you can call the police.,But what is the use if the police department is in itself steeped in corruption?,Most definitely you don't want to pay the bribe.,But you also don't have the time, resources,,expertise or wherewithal to fight this.,Unfortunately, many of us in this room,are supporters of capitalist policies and market forces. 
 Yet the market forces around the world,have not yet thrown up a service where you can call in,,pay a fee, and fight the demand for a bribe.,Like a bribe buster service,,or 1-800-Fight-Bribes,,or www.stopbribes.org or,www.preventcorruption.org.,Such a service simply do not exist.,One image that has haunted me,from my early business days,is of a grandmother, 70 plus years, being harassed,by the bureaucrats in the town planning office.,All she needed was permission to build three steps,to her house, from ground level,,making it easier for her to enter and exit her house.,Yet the officer in charge would not simply give her the permit,for want of a bribe.,Even though it pricked my conscience then,,I could not, or rather I did not,tend to her or assist her,,because I was busy building my real estate company.,I don't want to be haunted by such images any more. 
 A group of us have been working on a pilot basis,to address individual instances of demands,for bribes for common services or entitlement.,And in all 42 cases where we have pushed back such demands,using existing and legitimate tools,like the Right to Information Act,,video, audio, or peer pressure,,we have successfully obtained whatever our clients,set out to achieve without actually paying a bribe.,And with the cost of these tools being substantially lower,than the bribe demanded.,I believe that these tools that worked in these 42 pilot cases,can be consolidated in standard processes,in a BPO kind of environment,,and made available on web, call-center,and franchise physical offices,,for a fee, to serve anyone confronted with a demand for a bribe.,The target market is as tempting as it can get.,It can be worth up to one trillion dollars,,being paid in bribes every year,,or equal to India's GDP.,And it is an absolutely virgin market. 
 I propose to explore this idea further,,to examine the potential of creating,a for-profit, fee-based BPO,kind of service to stop bribes,and prevent corruption.,I do realize that the fight for justice,against corruption is never easy.,It never has been and it never will be.,In my last 18 months as a lawyer,,battling small- and large-scale corruption,,including the one perpetrated by India's biggest corporate scamster.,Through his charities,I have had three police cases filed against me,alleging trespass, impersonation and intimidation.,The battle against corruption,exacts a toll on ourselves,,our families, our friends, and even our kids.,Yet I believe the price we pay is well worth holding on,to our dignity and making the world a fairer place. 
 What gives us the courage?,As my close friend replied, when told,during the seeding days of the ambulance project,that it is an impossible task,and the founders are insane to chalk up their blue-chip jobs,,I quote: "Of course we cannot fail in this,,at least in our own minds.,For we are insane people,,trying to do an impossible task.,And an insane person does not know what an impossible task is." Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: Shaffi, that is a really exciting business idea.,Shaffi Mather: I just have to get through the initial days where I don't get eliminated. 
 (Laughter) 
 CA: What's on your mind?,I mean, give us a sense of the numbers here --,a typical bribe and a typical fee. I mean, what's in your head? 
 SM: So let me ... Let me give you an example.,Somebody who had applied for the passport.,The officer was just sitting on it,and was demanding around 3,000 rupees in bribes.,And he did not want to pay.,So we actually used the Right to Information Act,,which is equal to the Freedom of Information Act in the United States,,and pushed back the officers in this particular case.,And in all these 42 cases,,when we kept pushing them back,,there was three kinds of reaction.,A set of people actually say,,"Oh, let me just grant it to them, and run away from it.",Some people actually come back and say,,"Oh, you want to screw me. Let me show you what I can do.",And he will push us back.,So you take the next step, or use the next tool available,in what we are putting together,,and then he relents.,By the third time, in all 42 cases, we have achieved success. 
 CA: But if it's a 3,000-rupee, 70-dollar bribe,,what fee would you have to charge,,and can you actually make the business work? 
 SM: Well, actually the cost that we incurred,was less than 200 rupees.,So, it actually works. 
 CA: That's a high gross margin business. I like it. 
 (Laughter) 
 SM: I actually did not want to answer this on the TED stage. 
 CA: OK, so these are provisional numbers, no pricing guarantee.,If you can pull this off, you will be a global hero.,I mean, this could be huge.,Thank you so much for sharing this idea at TED. 
 (Applause)I'm talking to you about,the worst form of human rights violation,,the third-largest organized crime,,a $10 billion industry.,I'm talking to you about modern-day slavery. 
 I'd like to tell you the story,of these three children,,Pranitha, Shaheen and Anjali.,Pranitha's mother was a woman in prostitution,,a prostituted person.,She got infected with HIV,,and towards the end of her life,,when she was in the final stages of AIDS,,she could not prostitute,,so she sold four-year-old Pranitha to a broker.,By the time we got the information, we reached there,,Pranitha was already raped by three men. 
 Shaheen's background I don't even know.,We found her in a railway track,,raped by many, many men, I don't know many.,But the indications of that on her body was,that her intestine was outside her body.,And when we took her to the hospital,she needed 32 stitches to put back her intestine into her body.,We still don't know who her parents are, who she is.,All that we know that hundreds of men,had used her brutally. 
 Anjali's father, a drunkard,,sold his child for pornography.,You're seeing here images of,three years, four-year-olds, and five-year-old children,who have been trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation.,In this country, and across the globe,,hundreds and thousands of children,,as young as three, as young as four,,are sold into sexual slavery.,But that's not the only purpose that human beings are sold for.,They are sold in the name of adoption.,They are sold in the name of organ trade.,They are sold in the name of forced labor,,camel jockeying, anything, everything. 
 I work on the issue of commercial sexual exploitation.,And I tell you stories from there.,My own journey to work with these children,started as a teenager.,I was 15 when I was gang-raped by eight men.,I don't remember the rape part of it so much,as much as the anger part of it.,Yes, there were eight men who defiled me, raped me,,but that didn't go into my consciousness.,I never felt like a victim, then or now.,But what lingered from then till now -- I am 40 today --,is this huge outrageous anger. 
 Two years, I was ostracized, I was stigmatized, I was isolated,,because I was a victim.,And that's what we do to all traffic survivors.,We, as a society, we have PhDs,in victimizing a victim.,Right from the age of 15,,when I started looking around me,,I started seeing hundreds and thousands of women and children,who are left in sexual slavery-like practices,,but have absolutely no respite,,because we don't allow them to come in. 
 Where does their journey begin?,Most of them come from very optionless families,,not just poor.,You have even the middle class sometimes getting trafficked.,I had this I.S. officer's daughter,,who is 14 years old, studying in ninth standard,,who was raped chatting with one individual,,and ran away from home because she wanted to become a heroine,,who was trafficked.,I have hundreds and thousands of stories of very very well-to-do families,,and children from well-to-do families,,who are getting trafficked. 
 These people are deceived, forced.,99.9 percent of them,resist being inducted into prostitution.,Some pay the price for it.,They're killed; we don't even hear about them.,They are voiceless, [unclear],,nameless people.,But the rest, who succumb into it,,go through everyday torture.,Because the men who come to them are not men who want to make you your girlfriends,,or who want to have a family with you.,These are men who buy you for an hour, for a day,,and use you, throw you. 
 Each of the girls that I have rescued --,I have rescued more than 3,200 girls --,each of them tell me one story in common ...,(Applause),one story about one man, at least,,putting chili powder in her vagina,,one man taking a cigarette and burning her,,one man whipping her.,We are living among those men: they're our brothers, fathers,,uncles, cousins, all around us.,And we are silent about them. 
 We think it is easy money.,We think it is shortcut.,We think the person likes to do what she's doing.,But the extra bonuses that she gets,is various infections, sexually transmitted infections,,HIV, AIDS, syphilis, gonorrhea, you name it,,substance abuse, drugs, everything under the sun.,And one day she gives up on you and me,,because we have no options for her.,And therefore she starts normalizing this exploitation.,She believes, "Yes, this is it, this is what my destiny is about.",And this is normal, to get raped by 100 men a day.,And it's abnormal to live in a shelter.,It's abnormal to get rehabilitated. 
 It's in that context that I work.,It's in that context that I rescue children.,I've rescued children as young as three years,,and I've rescued women as old as 40 years.,When I rescued them, one of the biggest challenges I had,was where do I begin.,Because I had lots of them,who were already HIV infected.,One third of the people I rescue,are HIV positive.,And therefore my challenge was to,understand how can I get out,the power from this pain.,And for me, I was my greatest experience.,Understanding my own self,,understanding my own pain,,my own isolation,,was my greatest teacher.,Because what we did with these girls,is to understand their potential. 
 You see a girl here who is trained as a welder.,She works for a very big company,,a workshop in Hyderabad,,making furnitures.,She earns around 12,000 rupees.,She is an illiterate girl,,trained, skilled as a welder.,Why welding and why not computers?,We felt, one of the things that these girls had,is immense amount of courage.,They did not have any pardas inside their body,,hijabs inside themselves;,they've crossed the barrier of it.,And therefore they could fight in a male-dominated world,,very easily, and not feel very shy about it. 
 We have trained girls as carpenters,,as masons,,as security guards, as cab drivers.,And each one of them are excelling,in their chosen field,,gaining confidence, restoring dignity,,and building hopes in their own lives.,These girls are also working in big construction companies,like Ram-ki construction, as masons, full-time masons. 
 What has been my challenge?,My challenge has not been the traffickers who beat me up.,I've been beaten up more than 14 times in my life.,I can't hear from my right ear.,I've lost a staff of mine who was murdered,while on a rescue.,My biggest challenge,is society.,It's you and me.,My biggest challenge is your blocks to accept these victims,as our own. 
 A very supportive friend of mine,,a well-wisher of mine,,used to give me every month, 2,000 rupees for vegetables.,When her mother fell sick she said,,"Sunitha, you have so much of contacts.,Can you get somebody in my house to work,,so that she can look after my mother?",And there is a long pause.,And then she says, "Not one of our girls." 
 It's very fashionable to talk about human trafficking,,in this fantastic A-C hall.,It's very nice for discussion, discourse,,making films and everything.,But it is not nice to bring them to our homes.,It's not nice to give them employment in our factories, our companies.,It's not nice for our children to study with their children.,There it ends.,That's my biggest challenge. 
 If I'm here today, I'm here not only as Sunitha Krishnan.,I'm here as a voice of the victims and survivors of human trafficking.,They need your compassion.,They need your empathy.,They need, much more than anything else,,your acceptance. 
 Many times when I talk to people,,I keep telling them one thing:,don't tell me hundred ways,how you cannot respond to this problem.,Can you ply your mind for that one way,that you can respond to the problem?,And that's what I'm here for,,asking for your support,,demanding for your support,,requesting for your support.,Can you break your culture of silence?,Can you speak to at least two persons about this story?,Tell them this story. Convince them to tell the story to another two persons. 
 I'm not asking you all to become Mahatma Gandhis,or Martin Luther Kings, or Medha Patkars,,or something like that.,I'm asking you, in your limited world,,can you open your minds? Can you open your hearts?,Can you just encompass these people too?,Because they are also a part of us.,They are also part of this world.,I'm asking you, for these children,,whose faces you see, they're no more.,They died of AIDS last year.,I'm asking you to help them,,accept as human beings --,not as philanthropy, not as charity,,but as human beings who deserve all our support.,I'm asking you this because no child, no human being,,deserves what these children have gone through.,Thank you.,(Applause)Good morning.,I've come here to share with you an experiment,of how to get rid of one form of human suffering.,It really is a story of Dr. Venkataswamy.,His mission and his message is about the Aravind Eye Care System.,I think first it's important for us to recognize what it is to be blind. 
 (Music) 
 Woman: Everywhere I went looking for work, they said no,,what use do we have for a blind woman?,I couldn't thread a needle or see the lice in my hair.,If an ant fell into my rice, I couldn't see that either. 
 Thulasiraj Ravilla: Becoming blind is a big part of it,,but I think it also deprives the person of their livelihood, their dignity,,their independence, and their status in the family.,So she is just one amongst the millions who are blind.,And the irony is that they don't need to be. 
 A simple, well-proven surgery can restore sight to millions,,and something even simpler, a pair of glasses, can make millions more see.,If we add to that the many of us here now,who are more productive because they have a pair of glasses,,then almost one in five Indians will require eye care,,a staggering 200 million people.,Today, we're reaching not even 10 percent of them. 
 So this is the context in which Aravind came into existence,about 30 years back,as a post-retirement project of Dr. V.,He started this with no money.,He had to mortgage all his life savings,to make a bank loan.,And over time, we have grown into a network of five hospitals,,predominately in the state of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry,,and then we added several, what we call Vision Centers,as a hub-and-spoke model.,And then more recently we started managing hospitals,in other parts of the country,and also setting up hospitals in other parts of the world as well. 
 The last three decades,,we have done about three-and-a-half million surgeries,,a vast majority of them for the poor people.,Now, each year we perform about 300,000 surgeries.,A typical day at Aravind, we would do about a thousand surgeries,,maybe see about 6,000 patients,,send out teams into the villages to examine, bring back patients,,lots of telemedicine consultations,,and, on top of that, do a lot of training,,both for doctors and technicians who will become the future staff of Aravind. 
 And then doing this day-in and day-out, and doing it well,,requires a lot of inspiration and a lot of hard work.,And I think this was possible thanks to the building blocks,put in place by Dr. V.,,a value system, an efficient delivery process,,and fostering the culture of innovation. 
 (Music) 
 Dr. V: I used to sit with the ordinary village man because I am from a village,,and suddenly you turn around and seem to be in contact with his inner being,,you seem to be one with him.,Here is a soul which has got all the simplicity of confidence.,Doctor, whatever you say, I accept it.,An implicit faith in you,and then you respond to it.,Here is an old lady who has got so much faith in me, I must do my best for her.,When we grow in spiritual consciousness,,we identify ourselves with all that is in the world,,so there is no exploitation.,It is ourselves we are helping.,It is ourselves we are healing. 
 (Applause) 
 This helped us build a very ethical and very highly patient-centric organization,and systems that support it.,But on a practical level, you also have to deliver services efficiently,,and, odd as it may seem, the inspiration came from McDonald's. 
 Dr. V: See, McDonald's' concept is simple.,They feel they can train people all over the world,,irrespective of different religions, cultures, all those things,,to produce a product in the same way,and deliver it in the same manner,in hundreds of places. 
 Larry Brilliant: He kept talking about McDonalds and hamburgers,,and none of it made any sense to us.,He wanted to create a franchise,,a mechanism of delivery of eye care,with the efficiency of McDonald's. 
 Dr. V: Supposing I'm able to produce eye care,,techniques, methods, all in the same way,,and make it available in every corner of the world.,The problem of blindness is gone. 
 TR: If you think about it, I think the eyeball is the same,,as American or African,,the problem is the same, the treatment is the same.,And yet, why should there be so much variation in quality and in service,,and that was the fundamental principle that we followed,when we designed the delivery systems.,And, of course, the challenge was that it's a huge problem,,we are talking of millions of people,,very little resource to deal with it,,and then lots of logistics and affordability issues. 
 And then so, one had to constantly innovate.,And one of the early innovations, which still continues,,is to create ownership in the community to the problem,,and then engage with them as a partner,,and here is one such event.,Here a community camp just organized,by the community themselves,,where they find a place, organize volunteers,,and then we'll do our part. You know, check their vision,,and then you have doctors who you find out what the problem is,and then determine what further testing should be done,,and then those tests are done by technicians,who check for glasses,,or check for glaucoma. 
 And then, with all these results, the doctor makes a final diagnosis,,and then prescribes a line of treatment,,and if they need a pair of glasses, they are available right there at the camp site,,usually under a tree.,But they get glasses in the frames of their choice,,and that's very important because I think glasses,,in addition to helping people see,,is also a fashion statement, and they're willing to pay for it.,So they get it in about 20 minutes,and those who require surgery, are counseled,,and then there are buses waiting,,which will transport them to the base hospital. 
 And if it was not for this kind of logistics and support,,many people like this would probably never get services,,and certainly not when they most need it.,They receive surgery the following day,,and then they will stay for a day or two,,and then they are put back on the buses,to be taken back to where they came from,,and where their families will be waiting to take them back home. 
 (Applause) 
 And this happens several thousand times each year.,It may sound impressive that we're seeing lots of patients,,very efficient process,,but we looked at, are we solving the problem?,We did a study, a scientifically designed process,,and then, to our dismay,,we found this was only reaching seven percent of those in need,,and we're not adequately addressing more, bigger problems. 
 So we had to do something different,,so we set up what we call primary eye care centers, vision centers.,These are truly paperless offices,with completely electronic medical records and so on.,They receive comprehensive eye exams.,We kind of changed the simple digital camera into a retinal camera,,and then every patient gets their teleconsultation with a doctor. 
 The effect of this has been that, within the first year,,we really had a 40 percent penetration in the market that it served,,which is over 50,000 people.,And the second year went up to 75 percent.,So I think we have a process by which,we can really penetrate into the market,and reach everyone who needs it,,and in this process of using technology, make sure,that most don't need to come to the base hospital. 
 And how much will they pay for this?,We fixed the pricing, taking into account,what they would save in bus fare in coming to a city,,so they pay about 20 rupees, and that's good for three consultations. 
 (Applause) 
 The other challenge was, how do you give high-tech,or more advanced treatment and care?,We designed a van with a VSAT,,which sends out images of patients to the base hospital,where it is diagnosed,,and then as the patient is waiting, the report goes back to the patient,,it gets printed out, the patient gets it,,and then gets a consultation about what they should be doing --,I mean, go see a doctor or come back after six months,,and then this happens as a way of,bridging the technology competence. 
 So the impact of all this has been essentially one of growing the market,,because it focused on the non-customer,,and then by reaching the unreached,,we're able to significantly grow the market. 
 The other aspect is how do you deal with this efficiently,when you have very few ophthalmologists?,So what is in this video is a surgeon operating,,and then you see on the other side,,another patient is getting ready.,So, as they finish the surgery,,they just swing the microscope over,,the tables are placed so that their distance is just right,,and then we need to do this, because, by doing this kind of process,,we're able to more than quadruple the productivity of the surgeon. 
 And then to support the surgeon,,we require a certain workforce.,And then we focused on village girls that we recruited,,and then they really are the backbone of the organization.,They do almost all of the skill-based routine tasks.,They do one thing at a time. They do it extremely well.,With the result we have very high productivity,,very high quality at very, very low cost.,So, putting all this together, what really happened was,the productivity of our staff was,significantly higher than anyone else. 
 (Applause) 
 This is a very busy table,,but what this really is conveying is that,,when it comes to quality, we have put in,very good quality-assurance systems.,As a result, our complications are significantly lower,than what has been reported in the United Kingdom,,and you don't see those kind of numbers very often. 
 (Applause) 
 So the final part of the puzzle is,,how do you make all this work financially,,especially when the people can't pay for it?,So what we did was, we gave away a lot of it for free,,and then those who pay, I mean, they paid local market rates,,nothing more, and often much less.,And we were helped by the market inefficiency.,I think that has been a big savior, even now.,And, of course, one needs the mindset to be wanting to give away,what you have as a surplus. 
 The result has been, over the years,,the expenditure has increased with volumes.,The revenues increase at a higher level,,giving us a healthy margin,while you're treating a large number of people for free.,I think in absolute terms,,last year we earned about 20-odd million dollars,,spent about 13 million, with over a 40 percent EBITA. 
 (Applause) 
 But this really requires going beyond what we do,,or what we have done,,if you really want to achieve solving this problem of blindness.,And what we did was a couple of very counter-intuitive things.,We created competition for ourselves,,and then we made eye care affordable,by making low-cost consumables.,We proactively and systematically,promoted these practices to many hospitals in India,,many in our own backyards and then in other parts of the world as well.,The impact of this has been that these hospitals,,in the second year after our consultation,,are double their output,and then achieve financial recovery as well. 
 The other part was how do you address,this increase in cost of technology?,There was a time when we failed to negotiate,the [intra-ocular lens] prices to be at affordable levels,,so we set up a manufacturing unit.,And then, over time, we were able to bring down the cost significantly,to about two percent of what it used to be when we started out.,Today, we believe we have about seven percent of the global market,,and they're used in about 120-odd countries. 
 To conclude, I mean, what we do, does it have a broader relevance,,or is it just India or developing countries?,So to address this, we studied UK versus Aravind.,What it shows is that we do roughly about 60 percent,of the volume of what the UK does,,near a half-million surgeries as a whole country.,And we do about 300,000.,And then we train about 50 ophthalmologists,against the 70 trained by them,,comparable quality, both in training and in patient care.,So we're really comparing apples to apples.,We looked at cost.,(Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 So, I think it is simple to say,just because the U.K. isn't India the difference is happening.,I think there is more to it.,I mean, I think one has to look at other aspects as well.,Maybe there is --,the solution to the cost could be in productivity,,maybe in efficiency, in the clinical process,,or in how much they pay for the lenses or consumables,,or regulations, their defensive practice.,So, I think decoding this can probably bring,answers to most developed countries,including the U.S., and maybe,Obama's ratings can go up again. 
 (Laughter) 
 Another insight, which, again, I want to leave with you,,in conditions where the problem is very large,,which cuts across all economic strata,,where we have a good solution,,I think the process I described,,you know, productivity, quality, patient-centered care,,can give an answer,,and there are many which fit this paradigm.,You take dentistry, hearing aid, maternity and so on.,There are many where this paradigm can now play,,but I think probably one of the most challenging things,is on the softer side. 
 Now, how do you create compassion?,Now, how do you make people own the problem,,want to do something about it?,There are a bit harder issues.,And I'm sure people in this crowd can probably find the solutions to these. 
 So I want to end my talk leaving this thought and challenge to you. 
 Dr. V: When you grow in spiritual consciousness,,we identify with all that is in the world,so there is no exploitation.,It is ourselves we are helping.,It is ourselves we are healing. 
 TR: Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I'd like to talk to you today about the human brain,,which is what we do research on at the University of California.,Just think about this problem for a second.,Here is a lump of flesh, about three pounds,,which you can hold in the palm of your hand.,But it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space.,It can contemplate the meaning of infinity,,ask questions about the meaning of its own existence,,about the nature of God. 
 And this is truly the most amazing thing in the world.,It's the greatest mystery confronting human beings:,How does this all come about?,Well, the brain, as you know, is made up of neurons.,We're looking at neurons here.,There are 100 billion neurons in the adult human brain.,And each neuron makes something like 1,000 to 10,000 contacts,with other neurons in the brain.,And based on this, people have calculated,that the number of permutations and combinations of brain activity,exceeds the number of elementary particles in the universe. 
 So, how do you go about studying the brain?,One approach is to look at patients who had lesions,in different part of the brain, and study changes in their behavior.,This is what I spoke about in the last TED.,Today I'll talk about a different approach,,which is to put electrodes in different parts of the brain,,and actually record the activity of individual nerve cells in the brain.,Sort of eavesdrop on the activity of nerve cells in the brain. 
 Now, one recent discovery that has been made,by researchers in Italy, in Parma,,by Giacomo Rizzolatti and his colleagues,,is a group of neurons called mirror neurons,,which are on the front of the brain in the frontal lobes.,Now, it turns out there are neurons,which are called ordinary motor command neurons in the front of the brain,,which have been known for over 50 years.,These neurons will fire when a person performs a specific action.,For example, if I do that, and reach and grab an apple,,a motor command neuron in the front of my brain will fire.,If I reach out and pull an object, another neuron will fire,,commanding me to pull that object.,These are called motor command neurons that have been known for a long time. 
 But what Rizzolatti found was,a subset of these neurons,,maybe about 20 percent of them, will also fire,when I'm looking at somebody else performing the same action.,So, here is a neuron that fires when I reach and grab something,,but it also fires when I watch Joe reaching and grabbing something.,And this is truly astonishing.,Because it's as though this neuron is adopting,the other person's point of view.,It's almost as though it's performing a virtual reality simulation,of the other person's action. 
 Now, what is the significance of these mirror neurons?,For one thing they must be involved in things like imitation and emulation.,Because to imitate a complex act,requires my brain to adopt the other person's point of view.,So, this is important for imitation and emulation.,Well, why is that important?,Well, let's take a look at the next slide.,So, how do you do imitation? Why is imitation important?,Mirror neurons and imitation, emulation. 
 Now, let's look at culture, the phenomenon of human culture.,If you go back in time about [75,000] to 100,000 years ago,,let's look at human evolution, it turns out,that something very important happened around 75,000 years ago.,And that is, there is a sudden emergence and rapid spread,of a number of skills that are unique to human beings,like tool use,,the use of fire, the use of shelters, and, of course, language,,and the ability to read somebody else's mind,and interpret that person's behavior.,All of that happened relatively quickly. 
 Even though the human brain had achieved its present size,almost three or four hundred thousand years ago,,100,000 years ago all of this happened very, very quickly.,And I claim that what happened was,the sudden emergence of a sophisticated mirror neuron system,,which allowed you to emulate and imitate other people's actions.,So that when there was a sudden accidental discovery,by one member of the group, say the use of fire,,or a particular type of tool, instead of dying out,,this spread rapidly, horizontally across the population,,or was transmitted vertically, down the generations. 
 So, this made evolution suddenly Lamarckian,,instead of Darwinian.,Darwinian evolution is slow; it takes hundreds of thousands of years.,A polar bear, to evolve a coat,,will take thousands of generations, maybe 100,000 years.,A human being, a child, can just watch its parent,kill another polar bear,,and skin it and put the skin on its body, fur on the body,,and learn it in one step. What the polar bear,took 100,000 years to learn,,it can learn in five minutes, maybe 10 minutes.,And then once it's learned this it spreads,in geometric proportion across a population. 
 This is the basis. The imitation of complex skills,is what we call culture and is the basis of civilization.,Now there is another kind of mirror neuron,,which is involved in something quite different.,And that is, there are mirror neurons,,just as there are mirror neurons for action, there are mirror neurons for touch.,In other words, if somebody touches me,,my hand, neuron in the somatosensory cortex,in the sensory region of the brain fires.,But the same neuron, in some cases, will fire,when I simply watch another person being touched.,So, it's empathizing the other person being touched. 
 So, most of them will fire when I'm touched,in different locations. Different neurons for different locations.,But a subset of them will fire even when I watch somebody else,being touched in the same location.,So, here again you have neurons,which are enrolled in empathy.,Now, the question then arises: If I simply watch another person being touched,,why do I not get confused and literally feel that touch sensation,merely by watching somebody being touched?,I mean, I empathize with that person but I don't literally feel the touch.,Well, that's because you've got receptors in your skin,,touch and pain receptors, going back into your brain,and saying "Don't worry, you're not being touched.,So, empathize, by all means, with the other person,,but do not actually experience the touch,,otherwise you'll get confused and muddled." 
 Okay, so there is a feedback signal,that vetoes the signal of the mirror neuron,preventing you from consciously experiencing that touch.,But if you remove the arm, you simply anesthetize my arm,,so you put an injection into my arm,,anesthetize the brachial plexus, so the arm is numb,,and there is no sensations coming in,,if I now watch you being touched,,I literally feel it in my hand.,In other words, you have dissolved the barrier,between you and other human beings.,So, I call them Gandhi neurons, or empathy neurons.,(Laughter) 
 And this is not in some abstract metaphorical sense.,All that's separating you from him,,from the other person, is your skin.,Remove the skin, you experience that person's touch in your mind.,You've dissolved the barrier between you and other human beings.,And this, of course, is the basis of much of Eastern philosophy,,and that is there is no real independent self,,aloof from other human beings, inspecting the world,,inspecting other people.,You are, in fact, connected not just via Facebook and Internet,,you're actually quite literally connected by your neurons.,And there is whole chains of neurons around this room, talking to each other.,And there is no real distinctiveness,of your consciousness from somebody else's consciousness. 
 And this is not mumbo-jumbo philosophy.,It emerges from our understanding of basic neuroscience.,So, you have a patient with a phantom limb. If the arm has been removed,and you have a phantom, and you watch somebody else,being touched, you feel it in your phantom.,Now the astonishing thing is,,if you have pain in your phantom limb, you squeeze the other person's hand,,massage the other person's hand,,that relieves the pain in your phantom hand,,almost as though the neuron,were obtaining relief from merely,watching somebody else being massaged. 
 So, here you have my last slide.,For the longest time people have regarded science,and humanities as being distinct.,C.P. Snow spoke of the two cultures:,science on the one hand, humanities on the other;,never the twain shall meet.,So, I'm saying the mirror neuron system underlies the interface,allowing you to rethink about issues like consciousness,,representation of self,,what separates you from other human beings,,what allows you to empathize with other human beings,,and also even things like the emergence of culture and civilization,,which is unique to human beings. Thank you.,(Applause)The moment I say "school,",so many memories come back to me.,It's like after every exam,nwhen I walk out,,the teacher would say, "Hey, come.,How did you do?",I would say with a great smile,n"I will definitely pass.",And I didn't understand why,,in one hand they say, "Speak the truth,",in the other hand, when you saynthe truth, they hated you.,So it went on like that,,and I didn't know wherenelse to find myself.,So I remember those nights,I used to go to sleep,with asking help from [the] Unknown,because, for some reason,,I couldn't believenwhat my father and mother,hanged in the Puja room as a god,,because my friend's family,had something else as a god.,So I thought, "I guessnI'll pray to [the] Unknown,and ask help,",and started getting help from everywhere,,each and every cornernof my life at that time.,My brothers started giving mena few tips about drawing and painting. 
 Then, when I was in eighth standard,around 13 years old,,I started working in a part-time job,in one of the signboardnartists called Putu.,And then school alsonstarted supporting me.,"Oh, he's bad at studies,,but let him sendnto the drawing competitions.",So it was good to survivenwith that little tool,that I found to findnmy own place in school.,And one of those competitions,,I just won a small,nlittle transistor Philips radio.,And I didn't have the patience to wait,until I reached home.,So I just switchednon in the train, loudly.,If you travel in Indian trains,,you can see people listening to radio,and, you know, even from their mobiles. 
 So at that time -- and I was 13 --,and I was listening to just radio,,and someone happened to sit next to me,,like these three people are sitting here.,You know, like just adjacent to me.,He just started asking, "Where didnyou buy the radio? How much is it?",I said, "It's a prizenfrom [an] art competition.",And he said, "Oh, I teachnat a college of arts.,I think,you should study in a school of art.,You just quit school and come there.",So, why I'm telling you this,,you know, maybe, you know,,whoever is sitting next to you cannchange your whole life -- it's possible.,It is that we need we neednto be open and fine-tuned.,So that's what made me enter,[the] college of arts after three attempts,and just continue to inquire,what I really want to donwith art work, or art,and finally I'm here in front of you. 
 When I look back, you know,,on what happened between that time,and now here --,the last 10/15 years --,I can see that most of the works,revolve around three subjects,,but it was not intentional.,And I just start out with a tracenbecause I was thinking,,"What really makes us?" -- you know,,it's actually [the] past,nwhat makes a person.,So I was thinking,,but when you look at the past,,the way to understand the past,is only by the traces available,,because we cannot go back [to] the past.,It can be ruins, or it can be music,,or it can be painting or drawingnor writing, whatever it is.,But it is just a kindnof trace of that time.,And that fascinated me,,to explore that territory.,So I was working on the line,,but instead of working about traces,,I started capturing traces. 
 So here are some of the worksnI would like to show you.,So this is called "Self In Progress.",It's just a trace of being in this body.,So here, what happened then,,you know -- what I really enjoyed the most,is that this sculpture,is nothing but a trace of myself.,It's almost like a 3D photograph.,So there is an element of performance,,and there is an element of sculpture,,and there is an element of feelingnone's self, so close to one's self.,So it's almost like fossilsnfor the future.,And then moved slowly,to explore the other possibilitiesnof capturing traces.,So this is what I was talkingnabout, while molding,,it's such a great experience,,because we have freedom of like walking,,or moving my hand or,nmoving around in the space,,but the moment this becomes solid,,when you cannot move even an inch,,because this is plaster of Paris, sonthe moment you pour it it's like liquid;,but after 20 minutes,nit's almost like a hard stone. 
 So this is capturingnthe trace of a thumbprint,because, knowingly or unknowingly,,whatever we do, you know,nwe leave our traces here.,So I just thought, "I'm going to capture,thumbprint, footprint,,or whatever traces we leave as humans.",This is the trace of fire,,this is the trace of sun.,Because when I was capturingntraces, you know,,this thought comes to me always:,is it, only when the object touchesnthe thing and it leaves the trace,,or is there other ways to capture it?",So this work is nothing but like --,because of the focal length of the lens,,it just shows what is on the other side.,So I just put the papernon the focal length,,which was an etching print,,then I got the portraitnof [the] sun from sunlight.,This is called "Dawn to Dawn.",What I did here, I just putnlike 10 feet [of] paper,then put a coconut rope,,and just burnt it.,So it took about 24nhours to get this line.,So wherever the fire is eating the paper,,that's what becomes the work --,detail. 
 Even though we have traces,when we try to understand them,,the perception and context,play a major role to understand it.,So do we really understand what it is,,or are we trying to get,what we think it is?,Then move towards questioningnthe perception,because, even though there are traces,,when you try to understand them,nyou know you play a major role.,So like let's say even a simple act.,How many of you sawna cow crossing in India,while you were comingnfrom Bangalore to Mysore?,Can you just raise the hand? 
 If you just ask an opinion,of how, everyone can interpret it.,Like, let's say, if a schoolteacher says,,she'll simply say, "Tonget to the other side.",Why the cow was crossingnthe road, you know.,The answer can be sondifferent if Potter said it.,He would say, "For the greater good.",Martin Luther King would say,,"I imagine a world wherenall cows will be free,to cross the road,,without having their motivesncalled into question.",(Laughter),Imagine Moses comes now, and he sees,the same cow walking around the street.,He would definitely say,,"God came down from heaven,,and he said unto the cow,,'Thou shalt cross the road.',And cow crossed the road,,and there was muchnrejoicing as a holy cow.",(Laughter),Freud would say,,"The fact that you're at all concerned,reveals your underlyingnsexual insecurity.",(Laughter),If we ask Einstein,,he would say, "Whethernthe cow crossed the road,,or the road moved underneath the cow,,depends on your frame of reference.",(Laughter),Or Buddha --,if he saw the same cow, he would say,,"Asking this question deniesnyour own nature [as a] cow." 
 (Laughter) 
 So, what we see,is just what we think often,,and most of the time,nwe don't see what it is.,It just all depends on one's perception.,And context, what is really context?,You know, I could just show younthis little piece of paper.,Because I always think meaningndoesn't really exist.,The meaning of what we createnin this world doesn't exist.,It's just created by the mind.,If you look at this piece of paper,,this is the breadth,and this is called length.,This is how we've been taught in school.,But if you tear it in the middle --,now, I didn't touch this breadth,,but still, the meaning of this changes.,So what we conceive as a meaning,is always not there;,it's on the other side,,even when we say dark, light,,good, bad, tall, short --,all meaning it doesn't exist in reality.,It's just that being a human,,the way we train to perceive the reality,creates this meaning. 
 So this work from this period,is mostly like --,you know, this is a workncalled "Light Makes Dark.",It's just captured through from the lamp.,So the lamp is not just givingna light, it's also giving a darkness.,So this is a work of art,nwhich is just trying to explore that.,This is called "Limit Out.",This shows how limited our eyenor hearing sense or touch --,do we really see?,This is an exact negative.,It's about six inches deep in the wall,,but it just appearsnlike it's coming out of the wall.,You know the wall is almost like --,this is the first skin,nand this is the second,,and there's a third,nand each creates a meaning.,And we're just pullingnthe wall off the gallery.,Again, "Inward Out.",It's a full-figure cast from myself.,It's about eight inches deep. 
 When I was doing that, I always wonderednsince I've worked with creators --,and now you know, I've movednto questioning the perception --,whenever I see the bird flying in the sky,,it just makes me feel like:,is there anything behind,nare there any traces up there,,which as a human, we don't see them?,Is there any way to capture the thought,into visual art?,I couldn't find it.,But a solution arrived,after being quiet and not workingnfor about six, seven months,,in the restroom,,when I was changing the air freshener,that goes from solid substance to vapor.,It's called Odonil.,This is the work I madenout of that material.,The process to get to makenthe sculpture was interesting,,because I wrote to Balsara,,who produces that airnfreshener called Odonil,,saying, "Dear Sir, I am an artist.nThis is my catalogue.,Will you help me to make this sculpture?",They never wrote back to me.,Then I thought, "I will gonto the Small Scale Industries,Facilitating Unit and ask help.",So I told them, "I'd like to startnan air freshener company.",They said, "Of course.,This is the fee for the project report,,and we will give younall the details," and they gave.,Finally, I went back to them and said,,"It's not for starting the company,nit's just to make my own work.,Please come for the show.",And they did.,And this work is in the DevinArt Foundation in Delhi. 
 In India, nobody reallyntalks about works of art;,they always talknabout the appreciation of art.,You buy this for 3,000 rupees,,it'll become 30,000 in two months.,This is the craft that was going on,,but there are a few collectors,who also collect art which can depreciate.,And this was collected by Anupam --,which is like, finally in the end,nhe will not have anything,,because it will evaporate.,So this is after a few weeks,,this is after a few months.,It's just all about questioningnthe preconceptions.,So if someone says, "Oh,nI see the portrait,",it may not be the portraitnafter a few months.,And if they say it's solid,,it will not be solid, it will evaporate.,And if they say they don't get it,,that's also not true,,because it's in the air.,It's in the same gallerynor in the same museum.,So they inhaled it,,but they are not aware of it. 
 While I was doing that work,,my mom and my dad,,they were looking at it and they said,,"Why do you deal with negativensubjects all the time?",And I was like, "What do you mean?","Light makes dark and nownevaporating self.,Don't you think it remainednsomething about death," they said.,"Of course not. For me," I'm thinking,,"this is tucked in some small solid,,but the moment it evaporates,,it's merged with the whole.",But she said, "No. Still, I don't like it.,Can you make something from nothing,as a sculptor?",I said, "No, mom. It can't be.,Because we can create,a sculpture,by gathering dust together,,or we can break the sculpturenand get the dust,,but there is nowhere that we cannbring dust into the universe." 
 So, I did this work for her.,It's called "Emerging Angel.",This is the first day --,it just gives the appearance,that one is becoming the other.,So, the same sculpture,after a few days.,This is after 15/20 days.,Through that small little slit,between the glass box and the wood,,the air goes underneath the sculpturenand creates the other one.,This gave me a greater faith.,That evaporating sculpturengave me a greater faith,that maybe therenis many more possibilities,to capture [the] invisible. 
 So what you see now,is called "Shadow Foreshadow.",And what I'd like to tell you,is we don't see shadow,nand we don't see light too;,we see the source of the light.,We see where it's bouncing,nbut we don't see [them] as they exist.,You know, that's why the nightnsky, we see the sky as dark,,but it's filled with light all the time.,When it's bounced on the moon, we see it.,The same thing in the darkroom.,The little dust particlenwill again, reflect the light,,and we realize the existence of light.,So we don't see dark, we don't see light,,we don't see gravity,nwe don't see electricity.,So, I just started doing this work,to inquire further,about how to sculpt,the space between this object and there.,Because, as a visual artist, if I'mnseeing this and I'm seeing that --,but how to sculpt this, you know?,If we sculpt this, thisnhas two reference points.,The skin of this is alsonrepresenting this.,And skin at the other endnalso represents the floor.,I did this as an experiment,of casting the shadow.,So this is a corrugatednbox and its shadow.,Then the second one --,the moment you bring any invisibleninto the visible world,it will have all the characteristicsnof the visible existence.,So that produced a shadow.,Then I thought, okay, let me sculpt that.,Then, again, that becomes an object.,Again, throwing light, then the third one.,So what you see is nothing but shadow,of a shadow of a shadow.,And then again, at that point,nthere is no shadow.,I thought, "Oh, good. Work is finished.",You can see the detail. 
 This is called "Gravity.",It's called "Breath." It's justntwo holes on the gallery wall.,It's a false wall, which contains,like 110 cubic feet.,So that hole actually,makes the air come out and go in.,So where it's happening, we can see,,but what is happeningnwill remain invisible only.,This is from the show calledn"Invisible," at Talwar Gallery.,This is called "Kaayam.",Detail. 
 And what I'd like to tell you,,our senses are so limited --,we cannot hear everything,nwe cannot see everything.,We don't feel, "I am touching the air,",but if the breeze is a little morenfaster, then I can feel it.,So all of our construction of reality,is through these limited senses.,So my request was like,,is there any way to use all this,as just a symbol or a sign?,And to really get to the point,,we should move beyond, you know,,go to the other sidenof the wall, like illogic,,like are invisible.,Because when we see someonenwalks, we see the footprint.,But if we're just cutting that footprintnfrom the whole thing and trying to analyze it,,you will miss the point,because the actual journey happensnbetween those footprints,,and the footprints are nothingnbut passing time. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I bring to you,a message from,tens of thousands of people --,in the villages, in the slums,,in the hinterland of the country --,who have solved problems,through their own genius,,without any,outside help.,When our home minister announces,a few weeks ago,a war on,one third of India,,about 200 districts that he mentioned,were ungovernable,,he missed the point.,The point that we have been stressing,for the last 21 years,,the point that,people may be economically poor,,but they're not poor in the mind.,In other words,,the minds on the margin,are not the marginal minds.,That is the message,,which we started 31 years ago.,And what did it start? 
 Let me just tell you, briefly, my personal journey,,which led me to come to this point.,In '85, '86, I was in Bangladesh,advising the government and the research council there,how to help scientists work on the lands,,on the fields of the poor people,,and how to develop research technologies,,which are based on the knowledge of the people.,I came back in '86.,I had been tremendously invigorated,by the knowledge and creativity that I found in that country,,which had 60 percent landlessness,but amazing creativity.,I started looking at my own work:,The work that I had done,for the previous 10 years,,almost every time,,had instances of knowledge,that people had shared. 
 Now, I was paid in dollars as a consultant,,and I looked at my income tax return,and tried to ask myself: "Is there a line in my return,,which shows how much of this income has gone,to the people whose knowledge,has made it possible?,Was it because I'm brilliant,that I'm getting this reward, or because of the revolution?,Is it that I write very well?,Is it that I articulate very well?,Is it that I analyze the data very well?,Is it because I'm a professor, and, therefore,,I must be entitled to this reward from society?",I tried to convince myself that, "No, no,,I have worked for the policy changes.,You know, the public policy will become,more responsive to the needs of the poor,,and, therefore I think it's okay.",But it appeared to me,that all these years that I'd been working on exploitation --,exploitation by landlords,,by moneylenders, by traders --,gave me an insight that,probably I was also an exploiter,,because there was no line in my income tax return,which showed this income accrued,because of the brilliance of the people --,those people who have shared their knowledge and good faith and trust with me --,and nothing ever went back to them.,So much so, that much of my work till that time,was in the English language. 
 The majority of the people from whom I learned didn't know English.,So what kind of a contributor was I?,I was talking about social justice,,and here I was, a professional,who was pursuing the most unjust act --,of taking knowledge from the people, making them anonymous,,getting rent from that knowledge,by sharing it and doing consultancy, writing papers and,publishing them in the papers,,getting invited to the conferences,,getting consultancies and whatever have you.,So then, a dilemma rose in the mind that,,if I'm also an exploiter, then this is not right;,life cannot go on like that.,And this was a moment of great pain and trauma,because I couldn't live with it any longer.,So I did a review of,ethical dilemma and value conflicts and management research,,wrote, read about 100 papers.,And I came to the conclusion that,while dilemma is unique,,dilemma is not unique; the solution had to be unique. 
 And one day -- I don't know what happened --,while coming back from the office towards home,,maybe I saw a honey bee,or it occurred to my mind that if I only could be like the honey bee,,life would be wonderful.,What the honey bee does: it pollinates,,takes nectar from the flower,,pollinates another flower, cross-pollinates.,And when it takes the nectar,,the flowers don't feel shortchanged.,In fact, they invite the honey bees,through their colors,,and the bees don't keep all the honey for themselves.,These are the three guiding principles of the Honey Bee Network:,that whenever we learn something from people,it must be shared with them in their language.,They must not remain anonymous. 
 And I must tell you that after 20 years,,I have not made one percent of change,in the professional practice of this art.,That is a great tragedy -- which I'm carrying still with me,and I hope that all of you will carry this with you --,that the profession still legitimizes publication,of knowledge of people without attributing them,by making them anonymous.,The research guidelines of U.S. National Academy of Sciences,or Research Councils of the U.K.,or of Indian Councils of Science Research,do not require,that whatever you learn from people, you must share back with them.,We are talking about an accountable society,,a society that is fair and just,,and we don't even do justice in the knowledge market.,And India wants to be a knowledge society.,How will it be a knowledge society?,So, obviously, you cannot have two principles of justice,,one for yourself and one for others.,It must be the same.,You cannot discriminate.,You cannot be in favor of your own values,,which are at a distance from,the values that you espouse.,So, fairness to one and to the other,is not divisible. 
 Look at this picture.,Can you tell me where has it been taken from,,and what is it meant for? Anybody?,I'm a professor; I must quiz you. (Laughter),Anybody? Any guess at all?,Pardon? (Audience Member: Rajasthan.),Anil Gupta: But what has it been used for? What has it been used for?,(Murmuring),Pardon?,You know, you're so right. We must give him a hand,,because this man knows how insensitive our government is.,Look at this. This is the site of the government of India.,It invites tourists,to see the shame of our country.,I'm so sorry to say that.,Is this a beautiful picture,or is it a terrible picture?,It depends upon how you look at the life of the people.,If this woman has to carry water on her head,for miles and miles and miles,,you cannot be celebrating that.,We should be doing something about it.,And let me tell you, with all the science and technology at our command,,millions of women still carry water on their heads.,And we do not ask this question. 
 You must have taken tea in the morning.,Think for a minute.,The leaves of the tea, plucked from the bushes;,you know what the action is? The action is:,The lady picks up a few leaves, puts them in the basket on the backside.,Just do it 10 times;,you will realize the pain in this shoulder.,And she does it a few thousand times,every day.,The rice that you ate in the lunch, and you will eat today,,is transplanted by women,bending in a very awkward posture,,millions of them,,every season, in the paddy season,,when they transplant paddy,with their feet in the water.,And feet in the water will develop fungus,,infections,,and that infection pains,because then other insects bite that point.,And every year,,99.9 percent of the paddy is transplanted manually.,No machines have been developed. 
 So the silence of scientists,,of technologists, of public policy makers,,of the change agent, drew our attention that this is not on, this is not on;,this is not the way society will work.,This is not what our parliament would do. You know,,we have a program for employment:,One hundred, 250 million people,have to be given jobs for 100 days by this great country.,Doing what? Breaking stones, digging earth.,So we asked a question to the parliament:,Do poor have heads?,Do poor have legs, mouth and hands, but no head? 
 So Honey Bee Network builds upon the resource in which poor people are rich.,And what has happened?,An anonymous, faceless, nameless person,gets in contact with the network,,and then gets an identity.,This is what Honey Bee Network is about.,And this network grew voluntarily,,continues to be voluntary,,and has tried to map the minds,of millions of people,of our country and other parts of the world who are creative.,They could be creative in terms of education,,they may be creative in terms of culture,,they may be creative in terms of institutions;,but a lot of our work is in the field of technological creativity,,the innovations,,either in terms of contemporary innovations,,or in terms of traditional knowledge.,And it all begins with curiosity.,It all begins with curiosity. 
 This person, whom we met -- and you will see it on the website,,www.sristi.org -- this tribal person,,he had a wish.,And he said, "If my wish gets fulfilled" --,somebody was sick and he had to monitor --,"God, please cure him.,And if you cure him, I will get my wall painted.",And this is what he got painted.,Somebody was talking yesterday about Maslowian hierarchy.,There could be nothing more wrong than,the Maslowian model of hierarchy of needs,because the poorest people in this country can get enlightenment.,Kabir, Rahim, all the great Sufi saints,,they were all poor people,,and they had a great reason. (Applause),Please do not ever think that,only after meeting your physiological needs and other needs,can you be thinking about your spiritual needs or your enlightenment.,Any person anywhere is capable,of rising to that highest point of attainment,,only by the resolve that they have in their mind that they must achieve something. 
 Look at this.,We saw it in Shodh Yatra. Every six months we walk,in different parts of the country.,I've walked about 4,000 kilometers in the last 12 years.,So on the wayside,we found these dung cakes,,which are used as a fuel.,Now, this lady, on the wall of the dung cake heap,,has made a painting.,That's the only space she could express her creativity.,And she's so marvelous.,Look at this lady, Ram Timari Devi,,on a grain bin. In Champaran, we had a Shodh Yatra,and we were walking,in the land where Gandhiji went,to hear about the tragedy, pain,of indigo growers.,Bhabi Mahato in Purulia and Bankura.,Look at what she has done.,The whole wall is her canvas. She's sitting there with a broom.,Is she an artisan or an artist?,Obviously she's an artist; she's a creative person.,If we can create markets for these artists,,we will not have to employ them for digging earth and breaking stones.,They will be paid for what they are good at, not what they're bad at.,(Applause) 
 Look at what Rojadeen has done.,In Motihari in Champaran,,there are a lot of people who sell tea on the shack,and, obviously, there's a limited market for tea.,Every morning you have tea, as well as coffee.,So he thought, why don't I convert,a pressure cooker into a coffee machine?,So this is a coffee machine. Just takes a few hundred rupees.,People bring their own cooker,,he attaches a valve and a steam pipe,,and now he gives you espresso coffee. (Laughter),Now, this is a real, affordable,coffee percolator that works on gas.,(Applause),Look at what Sheikh Jahangir has done.,A lot of poor people do not have,enough grains to get ground.,So this fellow is bringing,a flour-grinding machine on a two-wheeler.,If you have 500 grams, 1000, one kilogram,,he will grind it for it for you; the flourmill will not grind such a small quantity. 
 Please understand the problem of poor people.,They have needs which,have to be met efficiently,in terms of energy, in terms of cost, in terms of quality.,They don't want second-standard, second-quality outputs.,But to be able to give them high-quality output,you need to adapt technology to their needs.,And that is what Sheikh Jahangir did.,But that's not enough, what he did. Look at what he did here.,If you have clothes, and you don't have enough time to wash them,,he brought a washing machine,to your doorstep, mounted on a two-wheeler.,So here's a model where,a two-wheeler washing machine ...,He is washing your clothes and drying them at your doorstep.,(Applause),You bring your water, you bring your soap,,I wash the clothes for you. Charge 50 paisa, one rupee,for you per lot,,and a new business model can emerge.,Now, what we need is, we need,people who will be able to scale them up. 
 Look at this.,It looks like a beautiful photograph.,But you know what it is? Can anybody guess what it is?,Somebody from India would know, of course.,It's a tawa.,It's a hot plate made of clay.,Now, what is the beauty in it?,When you have a non-stick pan,,it costs about,,maybe, 250 rupees,,five dollars, six dollars.,This is less than a dollar,and this is non-stick;,it is coated with one of these,food-grade materials.,And the best part is that,,while you use a costly non-stick pan,,you eat the so-called Teflon,or Teflon-like material,because after some time the stuff disappears. Where has it gone?,It has gone in your stomach. It was not meant for that. (Laughter),You know? But here,in this clay hot plate,,it will never go into your stomach.,So it is better, it is safer;,it is affordable, it is energy-efficient.,In other words, solutions by the poor people need not be cheaper,,need not be, so-called, jugaad, need not be some kind of makeshift arrangement. 
 They have to be better, they have to be more efficient,,they have to be affordable.,And that is what Mansukh Bhai Prajapati has done.,He has designed this plate with a handle.,And now with one dollar,,you can afford a better alternative,than the people market is offering you.,This lady, she developed,a herbal pesticide formulation.,We filed the patent for her,,the National Innovation Foundation.,And who knows? Somebody will license this technology,and develop marketable products,,and she would get revenue.,Now, let me mention one thing:,I think we need a polycentric model of development,,where a large number of initiatives in different parts of the country,,in different parts of the world,,would solve the needs of locality,in a very efficient and adaptive manner.,Higher the local fit,,greater is the chance of scaling up. 
 In the scaling up,,there's an inherent inadequacy,to match the needs of the local people,,point by point, with the supply that you're making.,So why are people willing to adjust with that mismatch?,Things can scale up, and they have scaled up.,For example, cell phones: We have 400 million cellphones in this country.,Now, it is possible that I use only two buttons on the cellphone,,only three options on the cellphone.,It has 300 options, I'm paying for 300; I'm using only three,but I'm willing to live with it, therefore it is scaling up.,But if I had to get a match to match,,obviously, I would need a different design of a cellphone.,So what we're saying is that scalability,should not become an enemy of sustainability.,There must be a place in the world,for solutions that are only relevant for a locality,,and yet, one can be able to fund them. 
 One of the greatest studies that we've been finding is,that many times investors would ask this question --,"What is a scalable model?" --,as if the need of a community, which is only,located in a space and time,and has those needs only located in those places,,has no legitimate right to get them for free,because it's not part of a larger scale.,So either you sub-optimize your needs to a larger scale,or else you remain out.,Now, the eminent model, the long-tail model,tells you that small sales,of a large number of books, for example,,having only a few copies sold,can still be a viable model.,And we must find a mechanism where,people will pool in the portfolio, will invest in the portfolio,,where different innovations will go to,a small number of people in their localities,,and yet, the overall platform of the model will become viable. 
 Look at what he is doing.,Saidullah Sahib is an amazing man.,At the age of 70,,he is linking up something very creative. 
 (Music) 
 Saidullah Sahib: I couldn't wait for the boat.,I had to meet my love.,My desperation made me an innovator.,Even love needs help from technology.,Innovation is the light of my wife, Noor.,New inventions are the passion of my life.,My technology. 
 (Applause) 
 AG: Saidulluh Sahib is,in Motihari, again in Champaran.,Wonderful human being,,but he stills sells, at this age,,honey on a cycle to earn his livelihood,,because we haven't been able to convince the water park people,,the lake people, in [unclear] operations.,And we have not been able to convince the fire brigade people,in Mumbai -- where there was a flood a few years ago,and people had to walk 20 kilometers, wading in the water --,that, look, you should have this cycle in your fire brigade office,because you can then go to those lanes,where your buses will not go, where your transport will not go.,So we have not yet cracked the problem,of making it available as a rescue device,,as a vending device during the floods in eastern India,,when you have to deliver things to people,in different islands,where they're marooned.,But the idea has a merit. The idea has a merit. 
 What has Appachan done? Appachan, unfortunately, is no more,,but he has left behind a message.,A very powerful message 
 Appachan: I watch the world wake up every day. 
 (Music) 
 It's not that a coconut fell on my head,,and I came upon this idea.,With no money to fund my studies,,I scaled new heights.,Now, they call me the local Spiderman.,My technology. 
 (Applause) 
 AG: Many of you,might not realize and believe,that we have sold this product internationally --,what I call a G2G model,,grassroots to global.,And a professor in the University of Massachusetts,,in the zoology department,,bought this climber because she wanted,to study the insect diversity,of the top of the tree canopy.,And this device makes it possible,for her to take samples from a larger number of palms,,rather than only a few,,because otherwise she had to make a big platform,and then climb her [unclear] would climb on that.,So, you know, we are advancing the frontiers of science. 
 Remya Jose has developed ...,you can go to the YouTube and find India Innovates,and then you will find these videos.,Innovation by her when she was in class 10th:,a washing machine-cum-exercising machine.,Mr. Kharai who is a physically challenged person,,one and a half foot height, only.,But he has modified a two-wheeler so that he can get autonomy,and freedom and flexibility.,This innovation is from the slums of Rio.,And this person, Mr. Ubirajara.,We were talking about, my friends in Brazil,,how we scale up this model in China and Brazil.,And we have a very vibrant network in China, particularly,,but also emerging in Brazil and other parts of the world.,This stand on the front wheel, you will not find on any cycle.,India and China have the largest number of cycles.,But this innovation emerged in Brazil. 
 The point is, none of us should be parochial,,none of us should be so nationalistic to believe,that all good ideas will come only from our country.,No, we have to have the humility to learn,from knowledge of economically poor people, wherever they are.,And look at this whole range of cycle-based innovations:,cycle that's a sprayer, cycle that,generates energy from the shocks on the road.,I can't change the condition of the road,,but I can make the cycle run faster.,That is what Kanak Das has done.,And in South Africa,,we had taken our innovators,,and many of us had gone there share with the colleagues in South Africa,as to how innovation can become,a means of liberation,from the drudgery that people have.,And this is a donkey cart which they modified.,There's an axle here, of 30, 40 kg,,serving no purpose.,Remove it, the cart needs one donkey less. 
 This is in China. This girl needed a breathing apparatus.,These three people in the village,sat down and decided to think,,"How do we elongate the life of this girl of our village?",They were not related to her, but they tried to find out,,"How can we use ... ",They used a cycle, they put together a breathing apparatus.,And this breathing apparatus now saved the life,,and she's very welcome. 
 There's a whole range of innovations that we have.,A car, which runs on compressed air,with six paisa per kilometer.,Assam, Kanak Gogoi.,And you would not find this car in U.S. or Europe,,but this is available in India.,Now, this lady, she used to do the winding of the yarn,for Pochampally Saree.,In one day, 18,000 times,,she had to do this winding,to generate two sarees.,This is what her son has done after seven years of struggle.,She said, "Change your profession.",He said, "I can't. This is the only thing I know, but I'll invent a machine,,which will solve your problem.",And this is what he did, a sewing machine in Uttar Pradesh.,So, this is what SRISTI is saying:,"Give me a place to stand, and I will move the world." 
 I will just tell you that we are also doing a competition among children,for creativity, a whole range of things.,We have sold things all over the world,,from Ethiopia to Turkey to U.S. to wherever.,Products have gone to the market, a few.,These are the people whose knowledge made,this Herbavate cream for eczema possible.,And here, a company which licensed this herbal pesticide,put a photograph of the innovator on the packing,so that every time a user uses it,,it asks the user, "You can also be an innovator.,If you have an idea, send it back to us.",So, creativity counts, knowledge matters,,innovations transform, incentives inspire.,And incentives: not just material, but also non-material incentives. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)For emotions, we should not move quickly to the desert.,So, first, a small housekeeping announcement:,please switch off your,proper English check programs,installed in your brain.,(Applause) 
 So, welcome to the Golden Desert, Indian desert.,It receives the least rainfall in the country,,lowest rainfall.,If you are well-versed with inches, nine inches,,centimeters, 16 [centimeters].,The groundwater is 300 feet deep, 100 meters.,And in most parts it is saline, not fit for drinking.,So, you can't install hand pumps or dig wells,,though there is no electricity in most of the villages.,But suppose you use the green technology, solar pumps --,they are of no use in this area. 
 So, welcome to the Golden Desert.,Clouds seldom visit this area.,But we find 40 different names of clouds in this dialect used here.,There are a number of techniques to harvest rain.,This is a new work, it's a new program.,But for the desert society,this is no program; this is their life.,And they harvest rain in many ways.,So, this is the first device they use,in harvesting rain.,It's called kunds; somewhere it is called [unclear]. 
 And you can notice they have created,a kind of false catchment.,The desert is there, sand dunes, some small field.,And this is all big raised platform.,You can notice the small holes,the water will fall on this catchment,,and there is a slope.,Sometimes our engineers and architects,do not care about slopes in bathrooms,,but here they will care properly.,And the water will go where it should go.,And then it is 40 feet deep.,The waterproofing is done perfectly,,better than our city contractors,,because not a single drop should go waste in this. 
 They collect 100 thousand liters in one season.,And this is pure drinking water.,Below the surface there is hard saline water.,But now you can have this for year round.,It's two houses.,We often use a term called bylaws.,Because we are used to get written things.,But here it is unwritten by law.,And people made their house,,and the water storage tanks.,These raised up platforms just like this stage.,In fact they go 15 feet deep,,and collect rain water from roof,,there is a small pipe, and from their courtyard.,It can also harvest something like 25,000 in a good monsoon. 
 Another big one,,this is of course out of the hardcore desert area.,This is near Jaipur. This is called the Jaigarh Fort.,And it can collect six million gallons of rainwater in one season.,The age is 400 years.,So, since 400 years it has been giving you,almost six million gallons of water per season.,You can calculate the price of that water.,It draws water from 15 kilometers of canals. 
 You can see a modern road, hardly 50 years old.,It can break sometimes.,But this 400 year old canal, which draws water,,it is maintained for so many generations.,Of course if you want to go inside, the two doors are locked.,But they can be opened for TED people.,(Laughter),And we request them.,You can see person coming up with,two canisters of water.,And the water level -- these are not empty canisters --,water level is right up to this.,It can envy many municipalities,,the color, the taste, the purity of this water.,And this is what they call Zero B type of water,,because it comes from the clouds,,pure distilled water. 
 We stop for a quick commercial break,,and then we come back to the traditional systems.,The government thought that this is a very,backward area and we should bring,a multi-million dollar project,to bring water from the Himalayas.,That's why I said that this is a commercial break.,(Laughter),But we will come back, once again,,to the traditional thing.,So, water from 300, 400 kilometers away,,soon it become like this.,In many portions, water hyacinth,covered these big canals like anything. 
 Of course there are some areas where water is reaching,,I'm not saying that it is not reaching at all.,But the tail end, the Jaisalmer area,,you will notice in Bikaner things like this:,where the water hyacinth couldn't grow,,the sand is flowing in these canals.,The bonus is that you can find wildlife around it.,(Laughter) 
 We had full-page advertisements,,some 30 years, 25 years ago when this canal came.,They said that throw away your traditional systems,,these new cement tanks will supply you piped water.,It's a dream. And it became a dream also.,Because soon the water was not able to reach these areas.,And people started renovating their own structures. 
 These are all traditional water structures,,which we won't be able to explain in such a short time.,But you can see that no woman is standing on those.,(Laughter),And they are plaiting hair.,(Applause),Jaisalmer. This is heart of desert.,This town was established 800 years ago.,I'm not sure by that time,Bombay was there, or Delhi was there,,or Chennai was there, or Bangalore was there. 
 So, this was the terminal point for silk route.,Well connected, 800 years ago, through Europe.,None of us were able to go to Europe,,but Jaisalmer was well connected to it.,And this is the 16 centimeter area.,Such a limited rainfall,,and highest colorful life flourished in these areas.,You won't find water in this slide.,But it is invisible.,Somewhere a stream or a rivulet,is running through here.,Or, if you want to paint, you can paint it blue throughout,because every roof which you see in this picture,collects rainwater drops,and deposit in the rooms. 
 But apart from this system,,they designed 52 beautiful water bodies around this town.,And what we call private public partnership,you can add estate also.,So, estate, public and private entrepreneurs,work together to build this beautiful water body.,And it's a kind of water body for all seasons.,You will admire it. Just behold the beauty throughout the year.,Whether water level goes up or down,,the beauty is there throughout. 
 Another water body, dried up, of course,,during the summer period,,but you can see how the traditional society,combines engineering with aesthetics, with the heart.,These statues, marvelous statues,,gives you an idea of water table.,When this rain comes and the water starts filling this tank,,it will submerge these beautiful statues,in what we call in English today "mass communication.",This was for mass communication.,Everybody in the town will know that this elephant has drowned,,so water will be there for seven months or nine months,,or 12 months.,And then they will come and worship this pond,,pay respect, their gratitude. 
 Another small water body, called the [unclear].,It is difficult to translate in English,,especially in my English.,But the nearest would be "glory," a reputation.,The reputation in desert of this small water body is,that it never dries up.,In severe drought periods,nobody has seen this water body,getting dried up.,And perhaps they knew the future also.,It was designed some 150 years ago.,But perhaps they knew that on sixth, November, 2009,,there will be a TED green and blue session,,so they painted it like this.,(Laughter),(Applause) 
 Dry water body. Children are standing on,a very difficult device to explain.,This is called kund. We have, in English, surface water and ground water.,But this is not ground water.,You can draw ground water from any well.,But this is no ordinary well.,It squeeze the moisture,hidden in the sand.,And they have dubbed this water as the third one called [unclear].,And there is a gypsum belt running below it.,And it was deposited by the great mother Earth,,some three million years ago.,And where we have this gypsum strip,they can harvest this water. 
 This is the same dry water body.,Now, you don't find any kund;,they are all submerged.,But when the water goes down they will be able,to draw water from those structures throughout the year.,This year they have received only six centimeters.,Six centimeter of rainfall,,and they can telephone you,that if you find any water problem in your city,,Delhi, Bombay, Bangalore, Mysore,,please come to our area of six centimeters, we can give you water.,(Laughter) 
 How they maintain them?,There are three things: concept, planning,,making the actual thing, and also maintaining them.,It is a structure for maintain,,for centuries, by generations, without any department,,without any funding,,So the secret is "[unclear]," respect.,Your own thing, not personal property,,my property, every time. 
 So, these stone pillars,will remind you that you are entering into a water body area.,Don't spit, don't do anything wrong,,so that the clean water can be collected.,Another pillar, stone pillar on your right side.,If you climb these three, six steps,you will find something very nice.,This was done in 11th century.,And you have to go further down.,They say that a picture is worth a thousand words,,so we can say a thousand words right now,,an another thousand words.,If the water table goes down,,you will find new stairs.,If it comes up, some of them will be submerged.,So, throughout the year,this beautiful system will give you some pleasure.,Three sides, such steps, on the fourth side,there is a four-story building,where you can organize such TED conferences anytime.,(Applause) 
 Excuse me, who built these structures?,They are in front of you.,The best civil engineers we had, the best planners,,the best architects.,We can say that because of them,,because of their forefathers,,India could get the first engineering college,in 1847.,There were no English medium schools at that time,,even no Hindi schools, [unclear] schools.,But such people, compelled to the East India Company,,which came here for business, a very dirty kind of business ...,(Laughter),but not to create the engineering colleges.,But because of them, first engineering college was created,in a small village, not in the town. 
 The last point, we all know in our primary schools that,that camel is a ship of desert.,So, you can find through your Jeep,,a camel, and a cart.,This tire comes from the airplane.,So, look at the beauty from the desert society,who can harvest rainwater,,and also create something,through a tire from a jet plane,,and used in a camel cart. 
 Last picture, it's a tattoo,,2,000-years-old tattoo.,They were using it on their body.,Tattoo was, at one time,,a kind of a blacklisted,or con thing, but now it is in thing.,(Laughter),(Applause),You can copy this tattoo. I have some posters of this.,(Laughter),The center of life is water.,These are the beautiful waves.,These are the beautiful stairs,which we just saw in one of the slides.,These are the trees.,And these are the flowers which,add fragrance to our lives.,So, this is the message of desert.,Thank you very much.,(Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: So, first of all, I wish I had your eloquence, truly, in any language.,(Applause),These artifacts and designs are inspiring.,Do you believe that they can be used elsewhere,,that the world can learn from this?,Or is this just right for this place? 
 Anupam Mishra: No, the basic idea is to,utilize water that falls on our area.,So, the ponds, the open bodies, are everywhere,,right from Sri Lanka to Kashmir, and in other parts also.,And these [unclear], which stored water,,there are two type of things.,One recharge, and one stores.,So, it depends on the terrain.,But kund, which uses the gypsum belt,,for that you have to go back to your calendar,,three million years ago.,If it is there it can be done right now.,Otherwise, it can't be done.,(Laughter),(Applause) 
 CA: Thank you so much.,(Applause)Namaste. Salaam.,Shalom. Sat Sri Akal.,Greetings to all of you from Pakistan.,It is often said that we fear that which we do not know.,And Pakistan, in this particular vein, is very similar.,Because it has provoked, and does provoke,,a visceral anxiety in the bellies of many a Western soul,,especially when viewed through the monochromatic lens,of turbulence and turmoil.,But there are many other dimensions to Pakistan. 
 And what follows is a stream of images,,a series of images captured by some of Pakistan's,most dynamic and young photographers,,that aims to give you an alternative glimpse,,a look inside the hearts and minds,of some ordinary Pakistani citizens.,Here are some of the stories they wanted us to share with you. 
 My name is Abdul Khan. I come from Peshawar.,I hope that you will be able to see,not just my Taliban-like beard,,but also the richness and color,of my perceptions, aspirations and dreams,,as rich and colorful as the satchels that I sell. 
 My name is Meher and this is my friend Irim.,I hope to become a vet when I grow up,so that I can take care of stray cats and dogs,who wander around the streets of the village,that I live near Gilgit, northern Pakistan. 
 My name is Kailash. And I like to enrich lives,through technicolored glass.,Madame, would you like some of those orange bangles,with the pink polka dots? 
 My name is Zamin.,And I'm an IDP, an internally displaced person,,from Swat.,Do you see me on the other side of this fence?,Do I matter, or really exist for you? 
 My name is Iman. I am a fashion model,,an up-and-coming model from Lahore.,Do you see me simply smothered in cloth?,Or can you move beyond my veil,and see me for who I truly am inside? 
 My name is Ahmed. I am an Afghan refugee,from the Khyber agency.,I have come from a place of intense darkness.,And that is why I want to illuminate the world. 
 My name is Papusay.,My heart and drum beat as one.,If religion is the opium of the masses,,then for me, music is my one and only ganja. 
 A rising tide lifts all boats.,And the rising tide of India's,spectacular economic growth,has lifted over 400 million,Indians into a buoyant middle class.,But there are still over 650 million Indians,,Pakistanis, Sri Lankans, Bangladeshis, Nepalese,,who remain washed up on the shores of poverty. 
 Therefore as India and Pakistan, as you and I,,it behooves us to transcend our differences,,to celebrate our diversity,,to leverage our common humanity.,Our collective vision at Naya Jeevan,,which for many of you, as you all recognize,,means "new life" in Urdu and Hindi,,is to rejuvenate the lives of millions of low income families,by providing them with affordable access,to catastrophic health care.,Indeed it is the emerging world's first,HMO for the urban working poor. 
 Why should we do this as Indians and Pakistanis?,We are but two threads cut from the same cloth.,And if our fates are intertwined,,then we believe that it is good karma, it is good fortune.,And for many of us, our fortunes do indeed lie,at the bottom of the pyramid. Thank you.,(Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: Fantastic. Just stay up here.,That was fantastic.,I found that really moving.,You know, we fought hard to get at least,a small Pakistani contingent to come.,It felt like it was really important.,They went through a lot to get here.,Would the Pakistanis please just stand up please?,I just really wanted to acknowledge you.,(Applause),Thank you so much.So, imagine you're standing on a street anywhere in America,and a Japanese man comes up to you and says, 
 "Excuse me, what is the name of this block?" 
 And you say, "I'm sorry, well, this is Oak Street, that's Elm Street.,This is 26th, that's 27th." 
 He says, "OK, but what is the name of that block?" 
 You say, "Well, blocks don't have names.,Streets have names; blocks are just the,unnamed spaces in between streets." 
 He leaves, a little confused and disappointed. 
 So, now imagine you're standing on a street, anywhere in Japan,,you turn to a person next to you and say, 
 "Excuse me, what is the name of this street?" 
 They say, "Oh, well that's Block 17 and this is Block 16." 
 And you say, "OK, but what is the name of this street?" 
 And they say, "Well, streets don't have names.,Blocks have names.,Just look at Google Maps here. There's Block 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.,All of these blocks have names,,and the streets are just the unnamed spaces in between the blocks. 
 And you say then, "OK, then how do you know your home address?" 
 He said, "Well, easy, this is District Eight.,There's Block 17, house number one." 
 You say, "OK, but walking around the neighborhood,,I noticed that the house numbers don't go in order." 
 He says, "Of course they do. They go in the order in which they were built.,The first house ever built on a block is house number one.,The second house ever built is house number two.,Third is house number three. It's easy. It's obvious." 
 So, I love that sometimes we need to,go to the opposite side of the world,to realize assumptions we didn't even know we had,,and realize that the opposite of them may also be true. 
 So, for example, there are doctors in China,who believe that it's their job to keep you healthy.,So, any month you are healthy you pay them,,and when you're sick you don't have to pay them because they failed,at their job. They get rich when you're healthy, not sick.,(Applause) 
 In most music, we think of the "one",as the downbeat, the beginning of the musical phrase: one, two, three, four.,But in West African music, the "one",is thought of as the end of the phrase,,like the period at the end of a sentence.,So, you can hear it not just in the phrasing, but the way they count off their music:,two, three, four, one. 
 And this map is also accurate.,(Laughter) 
 There's a saying that whatever true thing you can say about India,,the opposite is also true.,So, let's never forget, whether at TED, or anywhere else,,that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear,,that the opposite may also be true.,Domo arigato gozaimashita.Namaste. Good morning.,I'm very happy to be here in India.,And I've been thinking a lot about what I have learned,over these last particularly 11 years,with V-Day and "The Vagina Monologues,",traveling the world,,essentially meeting with women and girls across the planet,to stop violence against women. 
 What I want to talk about today,is this particular cell,,or grouping of cells, that is in each and every one of us.,And I want to call it the girl cell.,And it's in men as well as in women.,I want you to imagine that this particular grouping of cells,is central to the evolution of our species,and the continuation of the human race. 
 And I want you imagine that at some point in history,a group of powerful people invested in owning and controlling the world,understood that the suppression of this particular cell,,the oppression of these cells,,the reinterpretation of these cells,,the undermining of these cells,,getting us to believe in the weakness of these cells,and the crushing, eradicating, destroying,,reducing these cells,,basically began the process of killing off the girl cell,,which was, by the way, patriarchy. 
 I want you to imagine that the girl is a chip,in the huge macrocosm of collective consciousness.,And it is essential to balance, to wisdom,and to actually the future of all of us.,And then I want you to imagine that this girl cell,is compassion,,and it's empathy, and it's passion itself,,and it's vulnerability,,and it's openness, and it's intensity,,and it's association, and it's relationship,,and it is intuitive. 
 And then let's think how compassion informs wisdom,,and that vulnerability is our greatest strength,,and that emotions have inherent logic,,which lead to radical, appropriate, saving action.,And then let's remember that we've been taught,the exact opposite by the powers that be,,that compassion clouds your thinking,,that it gets in the way,,that vulnerability is weakness,,that emotions are not to be trusted,,and you're not supposed to take things personally,,which is one of my favorites. 
 I think the whole world has essentially,been brought up not to be a girl.,How do we bring up boys? What does it mean to be a boy?,To be a boy really means not to be a girl.,To be a man means not to be a girl.,To be a woman means not to be a girl.,To be strong means not to be a girl.,To be a leader means not to be a girl.,I actually think that,being a girl is so powerful,that we've had to train everyone not to be that.,(Laughter) 
 And I'd also like to say that the irony,of course, is that denying girl,,suppressing girl, suppressing emotion,,refusing feeling has lead thus here.,Where we have now come to live in a world where,the most extreme forms of violence,,the most horrific poverty,,genocide, mass rapes,,the destruction of the Earth, is completely out of control.,And because we have suppressed our girl cells,and suppressed our girl-ship,,we do not feel what is going on. 
 So, we are not being charged with,the adequate response to what is happening.,I want to talk a little bit about,the Democratic Republic of Congo.,For me, it was the turning point of my life.,I have spent a lot of time there in the last three years.,I feel up to that point I had seen a lot in the world,,a lot of violence. 
 I essentially lived in the rape mines of the world for the last 12 years.,But the Democratic Republic of Congo,really was the turning point in my soul.,I went and I spent time,in a place called Bukavu,in a hospital called the Panzi Hospital,,with a doctor who was as close to a saint as any person I've ever met.,His name is Dr. Denis Mukwege.,In the Congo, for those of you who don't know,,there has been a war raging for the last 12 years,,a war that has killed nearly six million people.,It is estimated that somewhere between 300,000 and 500,000 women,have been raped there. 
 When I spent my first weeks at Panzi hospital,I sat with women,who sat and lined up every day to tell me their stories.,Their stories were so horrific,,and so mind-blowing and so on the other side of human existence,,that to be perfectly honest with you, I was shattered.,And I will tell you that what happened,is through that shattering,,listening to the stories of eight-year-old girls who had their insides eviscerated,,who had guns and bayonets and things shoved inside them,so they had holes, literally, inside them,where their pee and poop came out of them. 
 Listening to the story of 80-year-old women,who were tied to chains and circled,,and where groups of men would come and rape them periodically,,all in the name of economic exploitation,to steal the minerals so the West can have it and profit from them.,My mind was so shattered. 
 But what happened for me is that that shattering,actually emboldened me,in a way I have never been emboldened.,That shattering, that opening of my girl cell,,that kind of massive breakthrough of my heart,allowed me to become more courageous, and braver,,and actually more clever,than I had been in the past in my life. 
 I want to say that I think the powers that be,know that empire-building,is actually -- that feelings get in the way of empire-building.,Feelings get in the way of the mass acquisition of the Earth,,and excavating the Earth, and destroying things.,I remember, for example, when my father,,who was very, very violent, used to beat me.,And he would actually say, while he was beating me,,"Don't you cry. Don't you dare cry.",Because my crying somehow exposed his brutality to him.,And even in the moment he didn't want to be reminded,of what he was doing. 
 I know that we have systematically annihilated the girl cell.,And I want to say we've annihilated it in men as well as in women.,And I think in some ways,we've been much harsher to men,in the annihilation of their girl cell.,(Applause),I see how boys have been brought up, and I see this across the planet:,to be tough, to be hardened,,to distance themselves from their tenderness, to not cry.,I actually realized once in Kosovo,,when I watched a man break down,,that bullets are actually hardened tears,,that when we don't allow men to have their girl self,and have their vulnerability, and have their compassion,,and have their hearts, that they become hardened and hurtful,and violent. 
 And I think we have taught men to be secure,when they are insecure,,to pretend they know things when they don't know things,,or why would we be where we are?,To pretend they're not a mess when they are a mess.,And I will tell you a very funny story.,On my way here on the airplane, I was walking up and down the aisle of the plane.,And all these men, literally at least 10 men,,were in their little seats watching chick flicks.,And they were all alone, and I thought, "This is the secret life of men.",(Laughter) 
 I've traveled, as I said,,to many, many countries,,and I've seen, if we do what we do to the girl inside us,then obviously it's horrific to think,what we do to girls in the world.,And we heard from Sunitha yesterday,,and Kavita about what we do to girls.,But I just want to say that,I've met girls with knife wounds and cigarette burns,,who are literally being treated like ashtrays.,I've seen girls be treated like garbage cans.,I've seen girls who were beaten by their mothers,and brothers and fathers and uncles.,I've seen girls starving themselves to death in America,in institutions to look like some idealized version of themselves. 
 I've seen that we cut girls and we control them,and we keep them illiterate,,or we make them feel bad about being too smart.,We silence them. We make them feel guilty,for being smart. We get them to behave,,to tone it down, not to be too intense.,We sell them, we kill them as embryos,,we enslave them, we rape them.,We are so accustomed to robbing girls,of the subject of being the subjects of their lives,that we have now actually objectified them,and turned them into commodities. 
 The selling of girls is rampant across the planet.,And in many places they are worth less than goats and cows.,But I also want to talk about the fact that,if one in eight people on the planet,are girls between the ages of 10 to 24,,they are they key, really, in the developing world,,as well as in the whole world, to the future of humanity.,And if girls are in trouble because they face systematic disadvantages,that keep them where society wants them to be,,including lack of access to healthcare,,education, healthy foods,,labor force participation.,The burden of all the household tasks,usually falls on girls and younger siblings,,which ensures that they will never overcome these barriers. 
 The state of girls, the condition of girls,,will, in my belief -- and that's the girl inside us,and the girl in the world -- determine whether,the species survives.,And what I want to suggest is that,,having talked to girls, because I just finished a new book called,"I Am an Emotional Creature: The Secret Life of Girls Around the World,",I've been talking to girls for five years,,and one of the things that I've seen is true everywhere,is that the verb that's been enforced on girl,is the verb "to please.",Girls are trained to please.,I want to change the verb.,I want us all to change the verb.,I want the verb to be "educate,",or "activate," or "engage,",or "confront," or "defy," or "create.",If we teach girls to change the verb,we will actually enforce the girl inside us,and the girl inside them. 
 And I have to now share a few stories,of girls I've seen across the planet,who have engaged their girl,,who have taken on their girl in spite of,all the circumstances around them.,I know a 14-year-old girl in the Netherlands,,for example, who is demanding that she take a boat,and go around the entire world by herself. 
 There is a teenage girl who just recently,went out and knew that she needed 56 stars,tattooed on the right side of her face. 
 There is a girl, Julia Butterfly Hill,,who lived for a year in a tree,because she wanted to protect the wild oaks. 
 There is a girl who I met 14 years ago in Afghanistan,who I have adopted as my daughter,because her mother was killed. Her mother was a revolutionary.,And this girl, when she was 17 years old,,wore a burqa in Afghanistan,,and went into the stadiums,and documented the atrocities that were going on towards women,,underneath her burqa, with a video.,And that video became the video that went out all over the world,after 9/11 to show what was going on in Afghanistan. 
 I want to talk about Rachel Corrie,who was in her teens when she stood in front of an Israeli tank,to say, "End the occupation.",And she knew she risked death and she was literally gunned down,and rolled over by that tank. 
 And I want to talk about a girl that I just met recently,in Bukavu, who was impregnated by her rapist.,And she was holding her baby.,And I asked her if she loved her baby.,And she looked into her baby's eyes and she said,,"Of course I love my baby. How could I not love my baby?,It's my baby and it's full of love." 
 The capacity for girls to overcome situations,and to move on levels, to me, is mind-blowing.,There is a girl named Dorcas, and I just met her in Kenya.,Dorcas is 15 years old,,and she was trained in self-defense.,A few months ago she was picked up on the street,by three older men.,They kidnapped her, they put her in a car.,And through her self-defense, she grabbed their Adam's apples,,she punched them in the eyes,and she got herself free and out of the car. 
 In Kenya, in August,,I went to visit one of the V-Day safe houses for girls,,a house we opened seven years ago,with an amazing woman named Agnes Pareyio.,Agnes was a woman who was cut when she was a little girl,,she was female genitally mutilated.,And she made a decision as many women do across this planet,,that what was done to her would not be enforced and done,to other women and girls. 
 So, for years Agnes walked through the Rift valley.,She taught girls what a healthy vagina looked like,,and what a mutilated vagina looked like.,And in that time she saved many girls. And when we met her,we asked her what we could do for her,,and she said, "Well, if you got me a Jeep I could get around a lot faster.",So, we got her a Jeep. And then she saved 4,500 girls. 
 And then we asked her, "Okay, what else do you need?",And she said, "Well, now, I need a house.",So, seven years ago Agnes built the first V-Day safe house,in Narok, Kenya, in the Masai land.,And it was a house where girls could run away,,they could save their clitoris, they wouldn't be cut,,they could go to school.,And in the years that Agnes has had the house,,she has changed the situation there.,She has literally become deputy mayor.,She's changed the rules.,The whole community has bought in to what she's doing. 
 When we were there she was doing a ritual,where she reconciles girls, who have run away, with their families.,And there was a young girl named Jaclyn.,Jaclyn was 14 years old and she was in her Masai family,and there's a drought in Kenya.,So cows are dying, and cows are the most,valued possession.,And Jaclyn overheard her father,talking to an old man about,how he was about to sell her for the cows.,And she knew that meant she would be cut.,She knew that meant she wouldn't go to school.,She knew that meant she wouldn't have a future.,She knew she would have to marry that old man, and she was 14. 
 So, one afternoon, she'd heard about the safe house,,Jaclyn left her father's house,and she walked for two days, two days,through Masai land.,She slept with the hyenas. She hid at night.,She imagined her father killing her on one hand,,and Mama Agnes greeting her,,with the hope that she would greet her when she got to the house.,And when she got to the house she was greeted.,Agnes took her in, and Agnes loved her,,and Agnes supported her for the year.,She went to school and she found her voice,,and she found her identity, and she found her heart. 
 Then, her time was ready,when she had to go back to talk to her father,about the reconciliation, after a year.,I had the privilege of being in the hut,when she was reunited with her father and reconciled.,In that hut, we walked in,,and her father and his four wives were sitting there,,and her sisters who had just returned because,they had all fled when she had fled,,and her primary mother, who had been beaten,in standing up for her with the elders.,When her father saw her and saw who she had become,,in her full girl self,,he threw his arms around her and broke down crying.,He said, "You are beautiful. You have grown into a gorgeous woman.,We will not cut you.,And I give you my word, here and now,,that we will not cut your sisters either." 
 And what she said to him was,,"You were willing to sell me for four cows,,and a calf and some blankets.,But I promise you, now that I will be educated,I will always take care of you,,and I will come back and I will build you a house.,And I will be in your corner for the rest of your life." 
 For me, that is the power of girls.,And that is the power of transformation.,I want to close today,with a new piece from my book.,And I want to do it tonight,for the girl in everybody here.,And I want to do it for Sunitha.,And I want to do it for the girls that Sunitha talked about yesterday,,the girls who survive, the girls who can become somebody else.,But I really want to do it for each and every person here,,to value the girl in us,,to value the part that cries,,to value the part that's emotional,,to value the part that's vulnerable,,to understand that's where the future lies. 
 This is called "I'm An Emotional Creature.",And it happened because I met a girl in Watts, L.A.,I was asking girls if they like being a girl,,and all the girls were like, "No, I hate it. I can't stand it.,It's all bad. My brothers get everything.",And this girl just sat up and went, "I love being a girl.,I'm an emotional creature!",(Laughter),This is for her: 
 I love being a girl.,I can feel what you're feeling,as you're feeling inside the feeling before.,I am an emotional creature.,Things do not come to me as intellectual theories,or hard-pressed ideas.,They pulse through my organs and legs and burn up my ears.,Oh, I know when your girlfriend's really pissed off,,even though she appears to give you what you want.,I know when a storm is coming.,I can feel the invisible stirrings in the air.,I can tell you he won't call back. It's a vibe I share. 
 I am an emotional creature.,I love that I do not take things lightly.,Everything is intense to me,,the way I walk in the street, the way my momma wakes me up,,the way it's unbearable when I lose, the way I hear bad news. 
 I am an emotional creature.,I am connected to everything and everyone. I was born like that.,Don't you say all negative,that it's only only a teenage thing,,or it's only because I'm a girl.,These feelings make me better.,They make me present. They make me ready. They make me strong. 
 I am an emotional creature.,There is a particular way of knowing.,It's like the older women somehow forgot.,I rejoice that it's still in my body.,Oh, I know when the coconut's about to fall.,I know we have pushed the Earth too far.,I know my father isn't coming back,,and that no one's prepared for the fire.,I know that lipstick means more than show,,and boys are super insecure,,and so-called terrorists are made, not born.,I know that one kiss,could take away all my decision-making ability.,(Laughter),And you know what? Sometimes it should.,This is not extreme. It's a girl thing,,what we would all be if the big door inside us flew open. 
 Don't tell me not to cry, to calm it down,,not to be so extreme, to be reasonable.,I am an emotional creature.,It's how the earth got made, how the wind continues to pollinate.,You don't tell the Atlantic Ocean to behave.,I am an emotional creature.,Why would you want to shut me down or turn me off?,I am your remaining memory.,I can take you back.,Nothing's been diluted.,Nothing's leaked out.,I love, hear me, I love,that I can feel the feelings inside you,,even if they stop my life,,even if they break my heart,,even if they take me off track,,they make me responsible. 
 I am an emotional, I am an emotional,,incondotional, devotional creature.,And I love, hear me,,I love, love, love being a girl.,Can you say it with me?,I love, I love, love, love,being a girl!,Thank you very much.,(Applause)Hi. For those of you who haven't seen dancing bears,,these are the dancing bears.,In 1995, we started working on a two-year investigative research project,to try and find out what was going on.,Because the sloth bears in the wild were obviously getting depleted,because of this.,This is the Qalandar community. They are a marginalized Islamic community,who live across India,,and have been in India since the 13th century. 
 We went about getting evidence of what was going on.,And this is footage from a hidden camera in a button.,And we went in, pretending to be buyers.,And we found this right in this very state, in Karnataka.,And the bear cubs were being harvested from across the country,and being sold and traded.,These were being sold for about 2,000 dollars each,,and they are used for bear paw soup,,and also being trained, later on,,to become dancing bears like the one you just saw. 
 Sadly, the family of Qalandars depended on this bear.,The couple are barely 18 years old.,They already have four children beside them. You can see them.,And the economy of the family and their livelihood depended on those animals.,So, we had to deal with it in a very practical and sustainable manner. 
 Now, when we started working deeper and digging deeper,,we found that it's an illegal act.,These guys could go to jail for up to seven years,if they were caught by authorities.,And what they were doing to the bears was really appalling.,It was unacceptable.,The mother bears are usually killed.,The cubs, which are taken, are separated.,Their teeth are basically bashed out with a metal rod.,And they use a red hot iron needle to make a hole through the muzzle.,Now we had to start changing these people and converting them from using that,for a livelihood, to getting something else. 
 So, this is Bitu Qalandar, who was our first experiment.,And we were so unsure that this would work.,We weren't sure at all. And we managed to convince him.,And we said, "Okay, here is some seed fund.,Let's see if you can get something else." And we got the bear surrendered,to -- we set up a sanctuary. We have four sanctuaries in India.,And now he sells cool drinks, he's by the highway.,He has a telephone booth. 
 And then it started, there was no turning back after that.,This is Sadua who came and surrendered his bear.,And now he runs a cattle fodder store and a grain store,near Agra.,Then there was no looking back at all for us.,We gave cycle rickshaws.,We set up carpet-weaving units,,vocational training for the women.,The women were just not allowed to come out of the community,and work with mainstream society. So, we were able to address that. 
 Education. The kids never went to school.,They only had Islamic education, very little of it.,And they were never allowed to go to school,because they were an extra earning hand at home. So we managed to get education.,So, we sponsor 600 children education programs today.,We were able to ensure brighter futures for these people. 
 Of course we also had to get the bears in.,This is what happens to the bears when they come in.,And this is what we turn them into.,We have a veterinary facility in our rescue centers.,So, basically in 2002 there were,1,200 dancing bears.,We rescued over 550 dancing bears.,We've been able to ensure better futures for the people and the bears. 
 The big news that I want to announce today,is that next month we will be bringing in,the very last bear of India,,into our rescue center.,(Applause),And India will no longer have to witness this cruel barbaric practice,which has been here for centuries.,And the people can hold their heads up high.,And the Qalandar people will rise above all this cruel barbaric past,that they've lived all their lives.,And the beautiful bears can of course live in the wild again.,And there will be no more removing of these bears.,And the children, both humans and bear cubs,can live peacefully. Thank you.,(Applause)Contagious is a good word.,Even in the times of H1N1, I like the word.,Laughter is contagious. Passion is contagious.,Inspiration is contagious.,We've heard some remarkable stories from some remarkable speakers.,But for me, what was contagious about all of them,was that they were infected by something I call the,"I Can" bug. 
 So, the question is, why only them?,In a country of a billion people and some,,why so few?,Is it luck? Is it chance?,Can we all not systematically and consciously,get infected?,So, in the next eight minutes I would like to share with you my story.,I got infected when I was 17,,when, as a student of the design college,,I encountered adults who actually believed in my ideas,,challenged me and had lots of cups of chai with me.,And I was struck by just how wonderful it felt,,and how contagious that feeling was.,I also realized I should have got infected when I was seven. 
 So, when I started Riverside school 10 years ago it became a lab,,a lab to prototype and refine a design process,that could consciously infect the mind with the "I Can" bug.,And I uncovered,that if learning is embedded in real-world context,,that if you blur the boundaries between school and life,,then children go through a journey of "aware,",where they can see the change,,"enable," be changed,,and then "empower," lead the change.,And that directly increased student wellbeing.,Children became more competent,,and less helpless.,But this was all common sense. 
 So, I'd like to show you a little glimpse of what,common practice looks like at Riverside.,A little background: when my grade five was learning about child rights,,they were made to roll incense sticks,,agarbattis, for eight hours,to experience what it means to be a child laborer.,It transformed them. What you will see is their journey,,and then their utter conviction,that they could go out and change the world.,(Music) 
 That's them rolling.,And in two hours, after their backs were broke,,they were changed.,And once that happened,,they were out in the city convincing everybody,that child labor just had to be abolished.,And look at Ragav, that moment when his face changes,because he's been able to understand that he,has shifted that man's mindset.,And that can't happen in a classroom.,So, when Ragav experienced that,he went from "teacher told me,",to "I am doing it." And that's the "I Can" mindshift.,And it is a process that can be energized and nurtured. 
 But we had parents who said,,"Okay, making our children good human beings is all very well,,but what about math and science and English?,Show us the grades.",And we did. The data was conclusive.,When children are empowered,,not only do they do good,,they do well, in fact very well,,as you can see in this national benchmarking assessment,taken by over 2,000 schools in India,,Riverside children were outperforming the top 10 schools in India,in math, English and science. 
 So, it worked. It was now time to take it outside Riverside.,So, on August 15th, Independence Day, 2007,,the children of Riverside set out to infect Ahmedabad.,Now it was not about Riverside school.,It was about all children. So, we were shameless.,We walked into the offices of the municipal corporation, the police,,the press, businesses,,and basically said, "When are you going to wake up,and recognize the potential that resides in every child?,When will you include the child in the city?,Basically, open your hearts and your minds to the child." 
 So, how did the city respond?,Since 2007 every other month,the city closes down the busiest streets for traffic,and converts it into a playground for children and childhood.,Here was a city telling its child, "You can.",A glimpse of infection in Ahmedabad.,Video: [Unclear],So, the busiest streets closed down.,We have the traffic police and municipal corporation helping us.,It gets taken over by children.,They are skating. They are doing street plays.,They are playing, all free, for all children.,(Music) 
 Atul Karwal: aProCh is an organization which has been doing things for kids earlier.,And we plan to extend this to other parts of the city.,(Music) 
 Kiran Bir Sethi: And the city will give free time.,And Ahmedabad got the first child-friendly zebra crossing in the world. 
 Geet Sethi: When a city gives to the children,,in the future the children will give back to the city.,(Music) 
 KBS: And because of that,,Ahmedabad is known as India's first child-friendly city. 
 So, you're getting the pattern. First 200 children at Riverside.,Then 30,000 children in Ahmedabad, and growing.,It was time now to infect India.,So, on August 15th,,again, Independence Day, 2009,,empowered with the same process,,we empowered 100,000 children to say, "I can.",How? We designed a simple toolkit,,converted it into eight languages,,and reached 32,000 schools.,We basically gave children a very simple challenge.,We said, take one idea,,anything that bothers you,,choose one week,,and change a billion lives. 
 And they did. Stories of change,poured in from all over India,,from Nagaland in the east,,to Jhunjhunu in the west,,from Sikkim in the north, to Krishnagiri in the south.,Children were designing solutions for a diverse range of problems.,Right from loneliness to filling potholes in the street,to alcoholism,,and 32 children who stopped 16 child marriages,in Rajasthan.,I mean, it was incredible.,Basically again reaffirming that when adults believe in children,and say, "You can," then they will.,Infection in India.,This is in Rajasthan, a rural village. 
 Child: Our parents are illiterate and we want to teach them how to read and write.,KBS: First time, a rally and a street play in a rural school --,unheard of -- to tell their parents why literacy is important.,Look at what their parents says. 
 Man: This program is wonderful.,We feel so nice that our children can teach us how to read and write. 
 Woman: I am so happy that my students did this campaign.,In the future, I will never doubt my students' abilities.,See? They have done it. 
 KBS: An inner city school in Hyderabad.,Girl: 581. This house is 581 ... 
 We have to start collecting from 555. 
 KBS: Girls and boys in Hyderabad, going out,,pretty difficult, but they did it. 
 Woman: Even though they are so young, they have done such good work.,First they have cleaned the society, then it will be Hyderabad, and soon India. 
 Woman: It was a revelation for me. It doesn't strike me,that they had so much inside them. 
 Girl: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.,For our auction we have some wonderful paintings for you,,for a very good cause,,the money you give us will be used to buy hearing aids.,Are you ready, ladies and gentlemen? Audience: Yes!,Girl: Are you ready? Audience: Yes!,Girl: Are you ready? Audience: Yes! 
 KBS: So, the charter of compassion starts right here.,Street plays, auctions, petitions.,I mean, they were changing lives.,It was incredible.,So, how can we still stay immune?,How can we stay immune to that passion, that energy, that excitement?,I know it's obvious,,but I have to end with the most powerful symbol of change, Gandhiji.,70 years ago, it took one man,to infect an entire nation,with the power of "We can." 
 So, today who is it going to take,to spread the infection from 100,000 children,to the 200 million children in India?,Last I heard, the preamble still said, "We, the people of India," right?,So, if not us, then who?,If not now, then when?,Like I said, contagious is a good word.,Thank you.,(Applause)Right now is the most exciting time,to see new Indian art.,Contemporary artists in India are having a conversation with the world,like never before.,I thought it might be interesting, even for the many long-time,collectors here with us at TED, local collectors,,to have an outside view of 10 young Indian artists,I wish everyone at TED to know. 
 The first is Bharti Kher.,The central motif of Bharti's practice,is the ready-made store-bought bindi,that untold millions of Indian women apply to their foreheads,,every day, in an act closely associated with,the institution of marriage.,But originally the significance of the bindi,is to symbolize the third eye,between the spiritual world and the religious world.,Bharti seeks to liberate this everyday cliche, as she calls it,,by exploding it into something spectacular.,She also creates life-size fiberglass sculptures, often of animals,,which she then completely covers in bindis,,often with potent symbolism.,She says she first got started with,10 packets of bindis,,and then wondered what she could do with 10 thousand. 
 Our next artist, Balasubramaniam,,really stands at the crossroads of sculpture, painting and installation,,working wonders with fiberglass.,Since Bala himself will be speaking at TED,I won't spend too much time on him here today,,except to say that he really succeeds,at making the invisible visible. 
 Brooklyn-based Chitra Ganesh,is known for her digital collages,,using Indian comic books called amar chitra kathas,as her primary source material.,These comics are a fundamental way,that children, especially in the diaspora,,learn their religious and mythological folk tales.,I, for one, was steeped in these.,Chitra basically remixes and re-titles,these iconic images,to tease out some of the sexual and gender politics,embedded in these deeply influential comics.,And she uses this vocabulary in her installation work as well. 
 Jitish Kallat successfully practices across photography,,sculpture, painting and installation.,As you can see, he's heavily influenced,by graffiti and street art,,and his home city of Mumbai is an ever-present element in his work.,He really captures that sense of density,and energy which really characterizes modern urban Bombay.,He also creates phantasmagoric sculptures,made of bones from cast resin.,Here he envisions the carcass,of an autorickshaw he once witnessed burning in a riot. 
 This next artist, N.S. Harsha,,actually has a studio right here in Mysore.,He's putting a contemporary spin on the miniature tradition.,He creates these fine, delicate images,which he then repeats on a massive scale.,He uses scale to more and more spectacular effect,,whether on the roof of a temple in Singapore,,or in his increasingly ambitious installation work,,here with 192 functioning sewing machines,,fabricating the flags of every member of the United Nations. 
 Mumbai-based Dhruvi Acharya,builds on her love of comic books and street art,to comment on the roles and expectations,of modern Indian women.,She too mines the rich source material of amar chitra kathas,,but in a very different way than Chitra Ganesh.,In this particular work, she actually strips out the images,and leaves the actual text,to reveal something previously unseen, and provocative. 
 Raqib Shaw is Kolkata-born,,Kashmir-raised,,and London-trained.,He too is reinventing the miniature tradition.,He creates these opulent tableaus inspired by Hieronymus Bosch,,but also by the Kashmiri textiles of his youth.,He actually applies metallic industrial paints to his work,using porcupine quills to get this rich detailed effect. 
 I'm kind of cheating with this next artist,since Raqs Media Collective are really,three artists working together.,Raqs are probably the foremost practitioners,of multimedia art in India today,,working across photography, video and installation.,They frequently explore themes of globalization and urbanization,,and their home of Delhi is a frequent element in their work.,Here, they invite the viewer to analyze a crime,looking at evidence and clues embedded,in five narratives on these five different screens,,in which the city itself may have been the culprit. 
 This next artist is probably the alpha male,of contemporary Indian art, Subodh Gupta.,He was first known for creating giant photo-realistic canvases,,paintings of everyday objects,,the stainless steel kitchen vessels and tiffin containers,known to every Indian.,He celebrates these local and mundane objects globally,,and on a grander and grander scale,,by incorporating them into ever more colossal,sculptures and installations.,And finally number 10, last and certainly not least, 
 Ranjani Shettar,,who lives and works here in the state of Karnataka,,creates ethereal sculptures and installations,that really marry the organic to the industrial,,and brings, like Subodh, the local global.,These are actually wires wrapped in muslin,and steeped in vegetable dye.,And she arranges them so that the viewer,actually has to navigate through the space,,and interact with the objects.,And light and shadow are a very important part of her work.,She also explores themes of consumerism,,and the environment, such as in this work,,where these basket-like objects look organic and woven,,and are woven,,but with the strips of steel, salvaged from cars,that she found in a Bangalore junkyard. 
 10 artists, six minutes, I know that was a lot to take in.,But I can only hope I've whet your appetite,to go out and see and learn more,about the amazing things that are happening in art in India today.,Thank you very much for looking and listening.,(Applause)My name is Ryan Lobo,,and I've been involved in the documentary,filmmaking business all over the world for the last 10 years.,During the process of making these films,I found myself taking photographs,,often much to the annoyance of the video cameramen. 
 I found this photography of mine almost compulsive.,And at the end of a shoot, I would sometimes feel that,I had photographs that told a better story,than a sometimes-sensational documentary.,I felt, when I had my photographs,,that I was holding on to something true,,regardless of agendas or politics.,In 2007, I traveled to three war zones.,I traveled to Iraq, Afghanistan and Liberia.,And over there I experienced,other people's suffering, up close and personal,,immersed myself in some rather intense and emotional stories,,and at times I experienced great fear for my own life. 
 As always, I would return to Bangalore,,and often to animated discussions at friend's homes,,where we would discuss various issues,while they complained bitterly about the new pub timings,,where a drink often cost more than what they'd paid,their 14-year-old maid.,I would feel very isolated during these discussions.,But at the same time, I questioned myself,and my own integrity and purpose in storytelling.,And I decided that I had compromised,,just like my friends in those discussions,,where we told stories,in contexts we made excuses for,,rather than taking responsibility for. 
 I won't go into details about what led to a decision I made,,but let's just say it involved alcohol, cigarettes,,other substances and a woman.,(Laughter),I basically decided that it was I,,not the camera or the network,,or anything that lay outside myself,,that was the only instrument in storytelling,truly worth tuning.,In my life, when I tried to achieve things,like success or recognition, they eluded me.,Paradoxically, when I let go of these objectives,,and worked from a place of compassion and purpose,,looking for excellence, rather than the results of it,,everything arrived on its own, including fulfillment. 
 Photography transcended culture, including my own.,And it is, for me, a language which expressed the intangible,,and gives voice to people and stories without.,I invite you into three recent stories of mine,,which are about this way of looking, if you will,,which I believe exemplify the tenets,of what I like to call compassion in storytelling. 
 In 2007 I went to Liberia,,where a group of my friends and I,did an independent, self-funded film, still in progress,,on a very legendary and brutal war-lord,named General Butt Naked.,His real name is Joshua, and he's pictured here in a cell,where he once used to torture and murder people,,including children.,Joshua claims to have personally killed,more than 10,000 people during Liberia's civil war.,He got his name from fighting stark naked.,And he is probably the most prolific mass murderer,alive on Earth today. 
 This woman witnessed the General murdering her brother.,Joshua commanded his child-soldiers to commit unspeakable crimes,,and enforced his command with great brutality.,Today many of these children are addicted to drugs like heroin,,and they are destitute, like these young men in the image.,How do you live with yourself,if you know you've committed horrific crimes?,Today the General is a baptized Christian evangelist.,And he's on a mission. 
 We accompanied Joshua, as he walked the Earth,,visiting villages where he had once killed and raped.,He seeked forgiveness,,and he claims to endeavor to improve,the lives of his child-soldiers.,During this expedition I expected him,to be killed outright, and us as well.,But what I saw opened my eyes,to an idea of forgiveness,which I never thought possible.,In the midst of incredible poverty and loss,,people who had nothing absolved a man,who had taken everything from them.,He begs for forgiveness,,and receives it from the same woman,whose brother he murdered.,Senegalese, the young man seated on the wheelchair here,,was once a child soldier, under the General's command,,until he disobeyed orders,,and the General shot off both his legs.,He forgives the General in this image.,He risked his life as he walked up to people,whose families he'd murdered. 
 In this photograph a hostile crowd in a slum surrounds him.,And Joshua remains silent,as they vented their rage against him.,This image, to me, is almost like from a Shakespearean play,,with a man, surrounded by various influences,,desperate to hold on to something true within himself,,in a context of great suffering that he has created himself. 
 I was intensely moved during all this.,But the question is,,does forgiveness and redemption replace justice?,Joshua, in his own words, says that he does not mind,standing trial for his crimes,,and speaks about them from soapboxes across Monrovia,,to an audience that often includes his victims.,A very unlikely spokesperson for the idea of,separation of church and state. 
 The second story I'm going to tell you about,is about a group of very special fighting women,with rather unique peace-keeping skills.,Liberia has been devastated by one of Africa's,bloodiest civil wars,,which has left more than 200,000 people dead,,thousands of women scarred by rape and crime,on a spectacular scale.,Liberia is now home,to an all-woman United Nations contingent,of Indian peacekeepers. 
 These women, many from small towns in India,,help keep the peace, far away from home and family.,They use negotiation and tolerance,more often than an armed response.,The commander told me that a woman could gauge,a potentially violent situation,much better than men.,And that they were definitely capable of diffusing it non-aggressively.,This man was very drunk,,and he was very interested in my camera,,until he noticed the women, who handled him,with smiles, and AK-47s at the ready, of course.,(Laughter) 
 This contingent seems to be quite lucky,,and it has not sustained any casualties,,even though dozens of peacekeepers have been killed in Liberia.,And yes, all of those people killed were male.,Many of the women are married with children,,and they say the hardest part of their deployment,was being kept away from their children. 
 I accompanied these women on their patrols,,and watched as they walked past men,,many who passed very lewd comments incessantly.,And when I asked one of the women about the shock and awe response,,she said, "Don't worry, same thing back home.,We know how to deal with these fellows,",and ignored them. 
 In a country ravaged by violence against women,,Indian peacekeepers have inspired many local women,to join the police force.,Sometimes, when the war is over and all the film crews have left,,the most inspiring stories are the ones,that float just beneath the radar.,I came back to India and nobody was interested in buying the story.,And one editor told me that she wasn't interested,in doing what she called "manual labor stories." 
 In 2007 and 2009 I did stories on the Delhi Fire Service, the DFS,,which, during the summer, is probably the world's most active fire department.,They answer more than 5,000 calls in just two months.,And all this against incredible logistical odds,,like heat and traffic jams.,Something amazing happened during this shoot.,Due to a traffic jam, we were late in getting to a slum,,a large slum, which had caught fire.,As we neared, angry crowds attacked our trucks,and stoned them, by hundreds of people all over the place.,These men were terrified,,as the mob attacked our vehicle. 
 But nonetheless, despite the hostility,,firefighters left the vehicle and successfully fought the fire.,Running the gauntlet through hostile crowds,,and some wearing motorbike helmets to prevent injury.,Some of the local people forcibly took away the hoses,from the firemen to put out the fire in their homes.,Now, hundreds of homes were destroyed.,But the question that lingered in my mind was,,what causes people to destroy fire trucks,headed to their own homes?,Where does such rage come from?,And how are we responsible for this?,45 percent of the 14 million people,who live in Delhi live in unauthorized slums,,which are chronically overcrowded.,They lack even the most basic amenities.,And this is something that is common to all our big cities. 
 Back to the DFS. A huge chemical depot caught fire,,thousands of drums filled with petrochemicals,were blazing away and exploding all around us.,The heat was so intense, that hoses were used,to cool down firefighters,fighting extremely close to the fire, and with no protective clothing.,In India we often love to complain about our government bodies.,But over here, the heads of the DFS,,Mr. R.C. Sharman, Mr. A.K. Sharman,,led the firefight with their men.,Something wonderful in a country where,manual labor is often looked down upon.,(Applause) 
 Over the years, my faith in the power of storytelling has been tested.,And I've had very serious doubt about its efficacy,,and my own faith in humanity.,However, a film we shot still airs on the National Geographic channel.,And when it airs I get calls from all the guys I was with,and they tell me that they receive hundreds of calls congratulating them.,Some of the firemen told me that they were also inspired,to do better because they were so pleased,to get thank-yous rather than brick bats. 
 It seems that this story helped change perceptions about the DFS,,at least in the minds of an audience in part on televisions,,read magazines and whose huts aren't on fire.,Sometimes, focusing on what's heroic, beautiful and dignified,,regardless of the context,,can help magnify these intangibles three ways,,in the protagonist of the story, in the audience,,and also in the storyteller.,And that's the power of storytelling.,Focus on what's dignified, courageous and beautiful,,and it grows. Thank you.,(Applause)I'm standing in front of you today,in all humility,,wanting to share with you,my journey of the last six years,in the field of service,and education.,And I'm not a trained academic.,Neither am I a veteran social worker.,I was 26 years in the corporate world,,trying to make organizations profitable.,And then in 2003,I started Parikrma Humanity Foundation,from my kitchen table. 
 The first thing that we did was walk through the slums.,You know, by the way, there are two million people,in Bangalore, who live in 800 slums.,We couldn't go to all the slums,,but we tried to cover as much as we could.,We walked through these slums,,identified houses where children would never go to school.,We talked to the parents,,tried to convince them about sending their children to school.,We played with the children,,and came back home really tired,,exhausted, but with images,of bright faces, twinkling eyes,,and went to sleep. 
 We were all excited to start,,but the numbers hit us then:,200 million children,between four to 14 that,should be going to school, but do not;,100 million children,who go to school but cannot read;,125 million who cannot do basic maths.,We also heard that 250 billion Indian rupees,was dedicated for government schooling.,Ninety percent of it was spent on teachers' salary,and administrators' salary.,And yet, India has nearly,the highest teacher absenteeism,in the world,,with one out of four teachers,not going to school at all the entire academic year. 
 Those numbers were absolutely mind-boggling,,overwhelming, and we were constantly asked,,"When will you start? How many schools will you start?,How many children will you get?,How are you going to scale?,How are you going to replicate?",It was very difficult not to get scared, not to get daunted.,But we dug our heels,and said, "We're not in the number game.,We want to take one child at a time,and take the child right through school,,sent to college,,and get them prepared for better living,,a high value job." 
 So, we started Parikrma.,The first Parikrma school,started in a slum,where there were 70,000 people,living below the poverty line.,Our first school was,on a rooftop of a building inside the slums,,a second story building, the only second story building,inside the slums.,And that rooftop did not have,any ceiling, only half a tin sheet.,That was our first school. One hundred sixty-five children.,Indian academic year begins in June.,So, June it rains, so many a times,all of us would be huddled under the tin roof,,waiting for the rain to stop.,My God! What a bonding exercise that was.,And all of us,that were under that roof are still here together today.,Then came the second school,,the third school, the fourth school,and a junior college.,In six years now,,we have four schools, one junior college,,1,100 children,coming from 28 slums,and four orphanages.,(Applause) 
 Our dream is very simple:,to send each of these kids, get them prepared,to be educated,but also to live peacefully,,contented in this conflict-ridden,chaotic globalized world.,Now, when you talk global,you have to talk English.,And so all our schools,are English medium schools.,But they know there is this myth,that children from the slums,cannot speak English well.,No one in their family has spoken English.,No one in their generation has spoken English.,But how wrong it is. 
 Girl: I like adventurous books, and some of my favorites,are Alfred Hitchcock and [unclear],and Hardy Boys.,Although they are like,in different contexts,,one is magical, the other two are like investigation,,I like those books because,they have something special in them.,The vocabulary used in those books,and the style of writing.,I mean like once I pick up one book,I cannot put it down until I finish the whole book.,Even if it takes me four and a half hours,,or three and half hours to finish my book, I do it. 
 Boy: I did good research and I got the information,[on the] world's fastest cars.,I like Ducati ZZ143,,because it is the fastest,,the world's fastest bike,,and I like Pulsar 220 DTSI,because it is India's fastest bike. (Laughter) 
 Shukla Bose: Well, that girl that you saw,,her father sells flowers on the roadside.,And this little boy has been coming to school for five years.,But isn't it strange that little boys all over the world,love fast bikes? (Laughter),He hasn't seen one, he hasn't ridden one, of course,,but he has done a lot of research through Google search.,You know, when we started with our English medium schools,we also decided to adopt,the best curriculum possible,,the ICSE curriculum.,And again, there were people who laughed at me,and said, "Don't be crazy,choosing such a tough curriculum for these students.,They'll never be able to cope.",Not only do our children cope very well,,but they excel in it.,You should just come across to see,how well our children do. 
 There is also this myth that,parents from the slums,are not interested in their children going to school;,they'd much rather put them to work.,That's absolute hogwash.,All parents all over the world,want their children to lead a better life than themselves,,but they need to believe that change is possible. 
 Video: (Hindi) 
 SB: We have 80 percent attendance,for all our parents-teachers meeting.,Sometimes it's even 100 percent,,much more than many privileged schools.,Fathers have started to attend.,It's very interesting. When we started our school,the parents would give thumbprints in the attendance register.,Now they have started writing their signature.,The children have taught them.,It's amazing how much children can teach. 
 We have, a few months ago,,actually late last year,,we had a few mothers who came to us and said,,"You know, we want to learn how to read and write.,Can you teach us?" So, we started an afterschool,for our parents, for our mothers.,We had 25 mothers who came regularly,after school to study.,We want to continue with this program,and extend it to all our other schools. 
 Ninety-eight percent of our fathers are alcoholics.,So, you can imagine how traumatized,and how dysfunctional the houses are where our children come from.,We have to send the fathers to de-addiction labs,and when they come back,,most times sober, we have to find a job for them,so that they don't regress.,We have about three fathers who have been trained to cook.,We have taught them nutrition, hygiene.,We have helped them set up the kitchen,and now they are supplying food to all our children.,They do a very good job because,their children are eating their food,,but most importantly this is the first time,they have got respect,,and they feel that they are doing something worthwhile. 
 More than 90 percent of our non-teaching staff,are all parents and extended families.,We've started many programs,just to make sure that the child comes to school.,Vocational skill program for the older siblings,so the younger ones are not stopped from coming to school. 
 There is also this myth that children from the slums,cannot integrate with mainstream.,Take a look at this little girl,who was one of the 28 children,from all privileged schools,,best schools in the country,that was selected for the Duke University,talent identification program,and was sent to IIM Ahmedabad. 
 Video: Girl: Duke IIMA Camp. Whenever we see that IIMA,,it was such a pride for us to go to that camp.,Everybody was very friendly,,especially I got a lot of friends.,And I felt that my English has improved a lot,going there and chatting with friends.,There they met children who are,with a different standard and,a different mindset, a totally different society.,I mingled with almost everyone.,They were very friendly.,I had very good friends there,,who are from Delhi, who are from Mumbai.,Even now we are in touch through Facebook. 
 After this Ahmedabad trip,I've been like a totally different,mingling with people and all of those.,Before that I feel like I wasn't like this.,I don't even mingle, or start speaking with someone so quickly.,My accent with English improved a lot.,And I learned football, volleyball,,Frisbee, lots of games.,And I wouldn't want to go to Bangalore. Let me stay here.,Such beautiful food,,I enjoyed it. It was so beautiful.,I enjoyed eating food like,[unclear] would come and ask me,,"Yes ma'am, what you want?" It was so good to hear! 
 (Laughter),(Applause) 
 SB: This girl was working as a maid,before she came to school.,And today she wants to be a neurologist. 
 Our children are doing brilliantly in sports.,They are really excelling.,There is an inter-school athletic competition,that is held every year,in Bangalore, where 5,000 children participate,from 140 best schools in the city.,We've got the best school award for three years successively.,And our children are coming back home,with bags full of medals, with lots of admirers and friends.,Last year there were a couple of kids,from elite schools that came,to ask for admissions in our school.,We also have our very own dream team. 
 Why is this happening? Why this confidence?,Is it the exposure? We have professors,from MIT, Berkeley, Stanford,,Indian Institute of Science,who come and teach our children lots of scientific formulas,,experiments, much beyond the classroom.,Art, music are considered,therapy and mediums of expression.,We also believe that,it's the content that is more important.,It is not the infrastructure,,not the toilets, not the libraries,,but it is what actually happens in this school,that is more important.,Creating an environment of learning,,of inquiry, of exploration,is what is true education. 
 When we started Parikrma,we had no idea which direction we were taking.,We didn't hire McKinsey to do a business plan.,But we know for sure that,what we want to do today is,take one child at a time,,not get bogged with numbers,,and actually see the child complete,the circle of life,,and unleash his total potential.,We do not believe in scale,because we believe in quality,,and scale and numbers will automatically happen.,We have corporates that have stood behind us,,and we are able to, now, open more schools.,But we began with the idea,of one child at a time. 
 This is five-year-old Parusharam.,He was begging,by a bus stop a few years ago,,got picked up and is now in an orphanage,,has been coming to school for the last four and a half months.,He's in kindergarten.,He has learned how to speak English.,We have a model by which kids can speak English,and understand English,in three month's time.,He can tell you stories in English,of the thirsty crow, of the crocodile,and of the giraffe.,And if you ask him what he likes to do,he will say, "I like sleeping.,I like eating. I like playing.",And if you ask him what he wants to do,,he will say, "I want to horsing.",Now, "horsing" is going for a horse ride.,So, Parusharam comes to my office every day.,He comes for a tummy rub,,because he believes that will give me luck. (Laughter) 
 When I started Parikrma,I began with a great deal of arrogance,of transforming the world.,But today I have been transformed.,I have been changed with my children.,I've learned so much from them:,love, compassion, imagination,and such creativity.,Parusharam is Parikrma,with a simple beginning but a long way to go.,I promise you, Parusharam,will speak in the TED conference a few years from now.,Thank you.,(Applause)As an Indian, and now as a politician,and a government minister,,I've become rather concerned about,the hype we're hearing about our own country,,all this talk about India becoming a world leader,,even the next superpower.,In fact, the American publishers of my book,,"The Elephant, The Tiger and the Cell Phone,",added a gratuitous subtitle saying,,"India: The next 21st-century power.",And I just don't think that's what India's all about,,or should be all about. 
 Indeed, what worries me is the entire notion of world leadership,seems to me terribly archaic.,It's redolent of James Bond movies,and Kipling ballads.,After all, what constitutes a world leader?,If it's population, we're on course to top the charts.,We will overtake China by 2034.,Is it military strength? Well, we have the world's fourth largest army.,Is it nuclear capacity? We know we have that.,The Americans have even recognized it,,in an agreement.,Is it the economy? Well, we have now,the fifth-largest economy in the world,in purchasing power parity terms.,And we continue to grow. When the rest of the world took a beating last year,,we grew at 6.7 percent. 
 But, somehow, none of that adds up to me,,to what I think India really can aim to contribute in the world,,in this part of the 21st century.,And so I wondered, could,what the future beckons for India to be all about,be a combination of these things allied to something else,,the power of example,,the attraction of India's culture,,what, in other words, people like to call "soft power." 
 Soft power is a concept invented by a Harvard academic,,Joseph Nye, a friend of mine.,And, very simply, and I'm really cutting it short because of the time limits here,,it's essentially the ability of a country to attract others,because of its culture, its political values,,its foreign policies.,And, you know, lots of countries do this. He was writing initially about the States,,but we know the Alliance Francaise,is all about French soft power, the British Council.,The Beijing Olympics were an exercise in Chinese soft power.,Americans have the Voice of America and the Fulbright scholarships.,But, the fact is, in fact,,that probably Hollywood and MTV and McDonalds,have done more for American soft power,around the world than any specifically government activity. 
 So soft power is something that really emerges,partly because of governments,,but partly despite governments.,And in the information era we all live in today,,what we might call the TED age,,I'd say that countries are increasingly being judged,by a global public that's been fed,on an incessant diet of Internet news,,of televised images,,of cellphone videos, of email gossip.,In other words, all sorts of communication devices,are telling us the stories of countries,,whether or not the countries concerned want people to hear those stories. 
 Now, in this age, again, countries with access,to multiple channels of communication,and information have a particular advantage.,And of course they have more influence, sometimes, about how they're seen.,India has more all-news TV channels,than any country in the world,,in fact in most of the countries in this part of the world put together. 
 But, the fact still is that it's not just that.,In order to have soft power, you have to be connected.,One might argue that India has become,an astonishingly connected country.,I think you've already heard the figures.,We've been selling 15 million cellphones a month.,Currently there are 509 million cellphones,in Indian hands, in India.,And that makes us larger than the U.S. as a telephone market.,In fact, those 15 million cellphones,are the most connections that any country,,including the U.S. and China,,has ever established in the history of telecommunications. 
 But, what perhaps some of you don't realize,is how far we've come to get there.,You know, when I grew up in India,,telephones were a rarity.,In fact, they were so rare that elected members of Parliament,had the right to allocate 15 telephone lines,as a favor to those they deemed worthy.,If you were lucky enough to be a wealthy businessman,or an influential journalist, or a doctor or something, you might have a telephone.,But sometimes it just sat there. 
 I went to high school in Calcutta.,And we would look at this instrument sitting in the front foyer.,But half the time we would pick it up,with an expectant look on our faces,,there would be no dial tone.,If there was a dial tone and you dialed a number,,the odds were two in three you wouldn't get the number you were intending to reach.,In fact the words "wrong number" were more popular than the word "Hello.",(Laughter),If you then wanted to connect to another city,,let's say from Calcutta you wanted to call Delhi,,you'd have to book something called a trunk call,,and then sit by the phone all day, waiting for it to come through.,Or you could pay eight times the going rate,for something called a lightning call.,But, lightning struck rather slowly in our country in those days,,so, it was like about a half an hour for a lightning call to come through. 
 In fact, so woeful was our telephone service,that a Member of Parliament stood up in 1984 and complained about this.,And the Then-Communications Minister replied in a lordly manner,that in a developing country,communications are a luxury, not a right,,that the government had no obligation to provide better service,,and if the honorable Member wasn't satisfied with his telephone,,could he please return it, since there was an eight-year-long waiting list,for telephones in India. 
 Now, fast-forward to today and this is what you see:,the 15 million cell phones a month.,But what is most striking is who is carrying those cell phones.,You know, if you visit friends in the suburbs of Delhi,,on the side streets you will find a fellow with a cart,that looks like it was designed in the 16th century,,wielding a coal-fired steam iron,that might have been invented in the 18th century.,He's called an isthri wala. But he's carrying a 21st-century instrument.,He's carrying a cell phone because most incoming calls are free,,and that's how he gets orders from the neighborhood,,to know where to collect clothes to get them ironed. 
 The other day I was in Kerala, my home state,,at the country farm of a friend,,about 20 kilometers away from any place you'd consider urban.,And it was a hot day and he said, "Hey, would you like some fresh coconut water?",And it's the best thing and the most nutritious and refreshing thing you can drink,on a hot day in the tropics, so I said sure.,And he whipped out his cellphone, dialed the number,,and a voice said, "I'm up here.",And right on top of the nearest coconut tree,,with a hatchet in one hand and a cell phone in the other,,was a local toddy tapper,,who proceeded to bring down the coconuts for us to drink. 
 Fishermen are going out to sea and carrying their cell phones.,When they catch the fish they call all the market towns along the coast,to find out where they get the best possible prices.,Farmers now, who used to have to spend half a day of backbreaking labor,to find out if the market town was open,,if the market was on,,whether the product they'd harvested could be sold, what price they'd fetch.,They'd often send an eight year old boy all the way on this trudge,to the market town to get that information and come back,,then they'd load the cart.,Today they're saving half a day's labor with a two minute phone call. 
 So this empowerment of the underclass,is the real result of India being connected.,And that transformation is part of where India is heading today.,But, of course that's not the only thing about India that's spreading.,You've got Bollywood. My attitude to Bollywood is best summarized,in the tale of the two goats at a Bollywood garbage dump --,Mr. Shekhar Kapur, forgive me --,and they're chewing away on cans of celluloid discarded by a Bollywood studio.,And the first goat, chewing away, says, "You know, this film is not bad.",And the second goat says, "No, the book was better.",(Laughter) 
 I usually tend to think that the book is usually better,,but, having said that,,the fact is that Bollywood is now,taking a certain aspect of Indian-ness and Indian culture around the globe,,not just in the Indian diaspora in the U.S. and the U.K.,,but to the screens of Arabs and Africans, of Senegalese and Syrians.,I've met a young man in New York whose illiterate mother,in a village in Senegal,takes a bus once a month to the capital city of Dakar,,just to watch a Bollywood movie.,She can't understand the dialogue.,She's illiterate, so she can't read the French subtitles.,But these movies are made to be understood despite such handicaps,,and she has a great time in the song and the dance and the action.,She goes away with stars in her eyes about India, as a result. 
 And this is happening more and more.,Afghanistan, we know what a serious security problem,Afghanistan is for so many of us in the world.,India doesn't have a military mission there.,You know what was India's biggest asset in Afghanistan in the last seven years?,One simple fact:,you couldn't try to call an Afghan at 8:30 in the evening.,Why? Because that was the moment,when the Indian television soap opera,,"Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi," dubbed into Dari, was telecast on Tolo T.V.,And it was the most popular television show in Afghan history.,Every Afghan family wanted to watch it.,They had to suspend functions at 8:30.,Weddings were reported to be interrupted,so guests could cluster around the T.V. set,,and then turn their attention back to the bride and groom.,Crime went up at 8:30. I have read a Reuters dispatch --,so this is not Indian propaganda, a British news agency --,about how robbers in the town of Musarri Sharif*,stripped a vehicle of its windshield wipers,,its hubcaps, its sideview mirrors,,any moving part they could find, at 8:30,,because the watchmen were busy watching the T.V. rather than minding the store.,And they scrawled on the windshield in a reference to the show's heroine,,"Tulsi Zindabad": "Long live Tulsi.",(Laughter) 
 That's soft power. And that is what India is developing,through the "E" part of TED:,its own entertainment industry.,The same is true, of course -- we don't have time for too many more examples --,but it's true of our music, of our dance,,of our art, yoga, ayurveda, even Indian cuisine.,I mean, the proliferation of Indian restaurants,since I first went abroad as a student, in the mid '70s,,and what I see today, you can't go to a mid-size town in Europe or North America,and not find an Indian restaurant. It may not be a very good one.,But, today in Britain, for example,,Indian restaurants in Britain,employ more people than the coal mining,,ship building and iron and steel industries combined.,So the empire can strike back.,(Applause) 
 But, with this increasing awareness of India,,with you and with I, and so on,,with tales like Afghanistan,,comes something vital in the information era,,the sense that in today's world,it's not the side of the bigger army that wins,,it's the country that tells a better story that prevails.,And India is, and must remain, in my view, the land of the better story.,Stereotypes are changing. I mean, again, having gone to the U.S.,as a student in the mid '70s,,I knew what the image of India was then, if there was an image at all. 
 Today, people in Silicon Valley and elsewhere,speak of the IITs, the Indian Institutes of Technology,with the same reverence they used to accord to MIT.,This can sometimes have unintended consequences. OK.,I had a friend, a history major like me,,who was accosted at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam,,by an anxiously perspiring European saying,,"You're Indian, you're Indian! Can you help me fix my laptop?",(Laughter) 
 We've gone from the image of India as,land of fakirs lying on beds of nails,,and snake charmers with the Indian rope trick,,to the image of India as a land of mathematical geniuses,,computer wizards, software gurus.,But that too is transforming the Indian story around the world.,But, there is something more substantive to that.,The story rests on a fundamental platform,of political pluralism.,It's a civilizational story to begin with.,Because India has been an open society for millennia.,India gave refuge to the Jews, fleeing the destruction of the first temple,by the Babylonians, and said thereafter by the Romans. 
 In fact, legend has is that when Doubting Thomas, the Apostle, Saint Thomas,,landed on the shores of Kerala, my home state,,somewhere around 52 A.D.,,he was welcomed on shore by a flute-playing Jewish girl.,And to this day remains the only Jewish diaspora,in the history of the Jewish people, which has never encountered,a single incident of anti-semitism.,(Applause),That's the Indian story.,Islam came peacefully to the south,,slightly more differently complicated history in the north.,But all of these religions have found a place and a welcome home in India. 
 You know, we just celebrated, this year, our general elections,,the biggest exercise in democratic franchise in human history.,And the next one will be even bigger, because our voting population,keeps growing by 20 million a year.,But, the fact is,that the last elections, five years ago,,gave the world extraordinary phenomenon,of an election being won by a woman political leader,of Italian origin and Roman Catholic faith, Sonia Gandhi,,who then made way for a Sikh, Mohan Singh,,to be sworn in as Prime Minister,by a Muslim, President Abdul Kalam,,in a country 81 percent Hindu.,(Applause) 
 This is India, and of course it's all the more striking,because it was four years later that we all applauded,the U.S., the oldest democracy in the modern world,,more than 220 years of free and fair elections,,which took till last year to elect a president or a vice president,who wasn't white, male or Christian.,So, maybe -- oh sorry, he is Christian, I beg your pardon --,and he is male, but he isn't white.,All the others have been all those three.,(Laughter),All his predecessors have been all those three,,and that's the point I was trying to make.,(Laughter) 
 But, the issue is,that when I talked about that example,,it's not just about talking about India, it's not propaganda.,Because ultimately, that electoral outcome,had nothing to do with the rest of the world.,It was essentially India being itself.,And ultimately, it seems to me,,that always works better than propaganda.,Governments aren't very good at telling stories.,But people see a society for what it is,,and that, it seems to me, is what ultimately,will make a difference in today's information era,,in today's TED age. 
 So India now is no longer,the nationalism of ethnicity or language or religion,,because we have every ethnicity known to mankind, practically,,we've every religion know to mankind,,with the possible exception of Shintoism,,though that has some Hindu elements somewhere.,We have 23 official languages that are recognized in our Constitution.,And those of you who cashed your money here,might be surprised to see how many scripts there are,on the rupee note, spelling out the denominations.,We've got all of that.,We don't even have geography uniting us,,because the natural geography of the subcontinent,framed by the mountains and the sea was hacked,by the partition with Pakistan in 1947.,In fact, you can't even take the name of the country for granted,,because the name "India" comes from the river Indus,,which flows in Pakistan. 
 But, the whole point is that India,is the nationalism of an idea.,It's the idea of an ever-ever-land,,emerging from an ancient civilization,,united by a shared history,,but sustained, above all, by pluralist democracy.,That is a 21st-century story as well as an ancient one.,And it's the nationalism of an idea that,essentially says you can endure differences of caste, creed,,color, culture, cuisine, custom and costume, consonant, for that matter,,and still rally around a consensus.,And the consensus is of a very simple principle,,that in a diverse plural democracy like India,you don't really have to agree on everything all the time,,so long as you agree on the ground rules,of how you will disagree.,The great success story of India,,a country that so many learned scholars and journalists,assumed would disintegrate, in the '50s and '60s,,is that it managed to maintain consensus on how to survive without consensus. 
 Now, that is the India that is emerging into the 21st century.,And I do want to make the point,that if there is anything worth celebrating about India,,it isn't military muscle, economic power.,All of that is necessary,,but we still have huge amounts of problems to overcome.,Somebody said we are super poor, and we are also super power.,We can't really be both of those.,We have to overcome our poverty. We have to deal with the,hardware of development,,the ports, the roads, the airports,,all the infrastructural things we need to do,,and the software of development,,the human capital, the need for the ordinary person in India,to be able to have a couple of square meals a day,,to be able to send his or her children,to a decent school,,and to aspire to work a job,that will give them opportunities in their lives,that can transform themselves. 
 But, it's all taking place, this great adventure of conquering those challenges,,those real challenges which none of us can pretend don't exist.,But, it's all taking place in an open society,,in a rich and diverse and plural civilization,,in one that is determined to liberate and fulfill,the creative energies of its people.,That's why India belongs at TED,,and that's why TED belongs in India.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)In 2008, Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmar.,Millions of people were in severe need of help.,The U.N. wanted to rush people and supplies to the area.,But there were no maps, no maps of roads,,no maps showing hospitals, no way for help to reach the cyclone victims. 
 When we look at a map of Los Angeles or London,,it is hard to believe,that as of 2005, only 15 percent of the world,was mapped to a geo-codable level of detail.,The U.N. ran headfirst into a problem,that the majority of the world's populous faces:,not having detailed maps. 
 But help was coming.,At Google, 40 volunteers,used a new software,to map 120,000 kilometers of roads,,3,000 hospitals, logistics and relief points.,And it took them four days.,The new software they used? Google Mapmaker. 
 Google Mapmaker is a technology that empowers each of us,to map what we know locally.,People have used this software,to map everything from roads to rivers,,from schools to local businesses,,and video stores to the corner store. 
 Maps matter.,Nobel Prize nominee Hernando De Soto,recognized that the key to economic liftoff,for most developing countries,is to tap the vast amounts of uncapitalized land.,For example, a trillion dollars,of real estate remains uncapitalized in India alone. 
 In the last year alone,,thousands of users in 170 countries,have mapped millions of pieces of information,,and created a map of a level of detail never thought viable.,And this was made possible by,the power of passionate users everywhere. 
 Let's look at some of the maps,being created by users right now.,So, as we speak, people are mapping the world,in these 170 countries.,You can see Bridget in Africa who just mapped a road in Senegal.,And, closer to home, Chalua, an N.G. road in Bangalore. 
 This is the result of computational geometry,,gesture recognition, and machine learning.,This is a victory of thousands of users,,in hundreds of cities,,one user, one edit at a time. 
 This is an invitation to the 70 percent,of our unmapped planet.,Welcome to the new world.,(Applause)I was told to come herenand tell you all stories,,but what I'd like to do is insteadntell you why I'm suspicious of stories,,why stories make me nervous.,In fact, the more inspiredna story makes me feel,,very often, the more nervous I get.,(Laughter),So the best storiesnare often the trickiest ones.,The good and bad things about storiesnis that they are a kind of filter.,They take a lot of information,nand they leave some of it out,,and they keep some of it in.,But the thing about this filter isnthat it always leaves the same things in.,You're always leftnwith the same few simple stories.,There is the old sayingnthat just about every story,can be summed upnas "a stranger came to town.",There is a book by Christopher Booker,,where he claims there are reallynjust seven types of stories.,There is monster, rags to riches, quest,,voyage and return,ncomedy, tragedy, rebirth.,You don't have to agreenwith that list exactly,,but the point is this:nif you think in terms of stories,,you're telling yourself the same thingsnover and over again.,There was a study done,nwe asked some people--,people were asked to describe their lives.,When asked to describe their lives,,what is interestingnis how few people said "mess".,(Laughter),It's probably the best answer,nI don't mean that in a bad way.,"Mess" can be liberating,n"mess" can be empowering,,"mess" can be a waynof drawing upon multiple strengths.,But what people wanted to say was,n"My life is a journey.",51\% wanted to turnnhis or her life into a story.,11\% said, "My life is a battle."nAgain, that is a kind of story.,8\% said, "My life is a novel."n5\% said, "My life is a play.",I don't think anyone said,n"My life is a reality TV show.",(Laughter),But again, we're imposing ordernon the mess we observe,,and it's taking the same patterns,,and the thing is when somethingnis in the form of a story,,often, we remember it when we shouldn't.,So how many of you know the story,about George Washingtonnand the cherry tree?,It's not obvious that isnexactly what happened.,The story of Paul Revere, it's not obviousnthat that is exactly the way it happened.,So again, we should bensuspicious of stories.,We're biologically programmednto respond to them.,They contain a lot of information.nThey have social power.,They connect us to other people.,So they are like a candy that we're fed,when we consume political information,nwhen we read novels.,When we read non-fiction books,nwe're really being fed stories.,Non-fiction is, in a sense,nthe new fiction.,The book may happen to say true things,,but again, everything's takingnthe same form of these stories.,So what are the problemsnof relying too heavily on stories?,You view your life like this,instead of the messnthat it is or it ought to be.,But more specifically,nI think of a few major problems,when we think too muchnin terms of narrative.,First, narratives tend to be too simple,,for the point of a narrativenis to strip it away,,not just into 18 minutes,,but most narratives nyou can present in a sentence or two.,When you strip away detail,,you tend to tell storiesnin terms of good versus evil,,whether it's a story about your own lifenor a story about politics.,I know some things actually arengood versus evil, we all know this, right?,But I think, as a general rule,,we're too inclined to tellnthe good versus evil story.,As a simple rule of thumb,,just imagine that every timenyou're telling a good versus evil story,,you're basically lowering your IQnby ten points or more.,If you just adopt thatnas a kind of inner mental habit,,it's, in my view, one way to getna lot smarter pretty quickly.,You don't have to read any books.,Just imagine yourself pressing a button,every time you tellnthe good versus evil story,,and by pressing that button,,you're lowering your IQnby ten points or more.,Another set of stories that are popular--,if you know Oliver Stone's movies,nor Michael Moore's movies,,you can't make a movie and say:n"It was all a big accident.",No, it has to be a conspiracy,npeople plotting together,,because in a story,na story is about intention.,A story is not about spontaneous ordernor complex human institutions,which are the product of human action,nbut not of human design.,No, a story is about evil peoplenplotting together.,So when you hear stories about plots,,or even stories about good peoplenplotting things together,,just like when you're watching movies,,this, again, is reason to be suspicious.,As a good rule of thumb, if you're asking:,"When I hear a story, when should Inbe especially suspicious?",If you hear a story and you think:n"Wow, that would make a great movie!",(Laughter),That's when the "uh-oh" reactionnshould pop in a bit more,,and you should start thinking in terms,of how the whole thingnis maybe a bit of a mess.,Another common story or storyline isnthe claim that we "have to get tough".,You'll hear this in so many contexts.,We have to get tough with the banks.nWe had to get tough with the labor unions.,We need to get toughnwith some other country,,some foreign dictator,nsomeone we're negotiating with.,Again, the point is notnagainst getting tough.,Sometimes we should get tough.,That we got tough with the Nazisnwas a good thing.,But this is again a story we fall backnupon all too readily, all too quickly.,When we don't really knownwhy something happened,,we blame someone, and we say:n"We need to get tough with them!",As if it had never occurrednto your predecessor,,this idea of getting tough.,I view it usuallynas a kind of mental laziness.,It's a simple story you tell:n"We need to get tough,,we needed to get tough,nwe will have to get tough.",Usually, that is a kind of warning signal.,Another kind of problem with stories is,you can only fit so many storiesninto your mind at once,,or in the course of a day,nor even over the course of a lifetime.,So your stories are servingntoo many purposes.,For instance, just to getnout of bed in the morning,,you tell yourself the story,that your job is really important,nwhat you're doing is really important,(Laughter),and maybe it is, but I tell myselfnthat story even when it's not.,And you know what? That story works.,It gets me out of bed.,It's a kind of self-deception,,but the problem comesnwhen I need to change that story.,The whole point of the story isnthat I grab onto it and I hold it,,and it gets me out of bed.,So when I'm really doing somethingnthat is actually just a waste of time,,in my mess of a life,,I'm too tied into my storynthat got me out of bed,,and ideally, I ought to have somenvery complex story map in my mind,,you know, with combinatorialsnand a matrix of computation, and the like,,but that is not how stories work.,Stories in order to work nhave to be simple,,easily grasped, easily toldnto others, easily remembered.,So stories will serve dualnand conflicting purposes,,and very often they will lead us astray.,I used to think I wasnwithin the camp of economists,,I was one of the good guys,nand I was allied with other good guys,,and we were fightingnthe ideas of the bad guys.,I used to think that!,And probably, I was wrong.,Maybe sometimes, I'm one of the good guys,,but on some issues, I finally realized:n"Hey, I wasn't one of the good guys.",I'm not sure I was the bad guynin the sense of having evil intent,,but it was very hard for mento get away with that story.,One interesting thingnabout cognitive biases,is they are the subjectnof so many books these days.,There's the Nudge book,nthe Sway book, the Blink book,,like the one-title book,,all about the ways in which we screw up.,And there are so many ways,,but what I find interestingnis that none of these books identify,what, to me, is the single, central,nmost important way we screw up,,and that is that we tellnourselves too many stories,,or we are too easily seduced by stories.,Why don't these books tell us that?,It's because the books themselvesnare all about stories.,The more of these books you read,nyou're learning about some of your biases,,but you're making somenof your other biases essentially worse.,So the books themselvesnare part of your cognitive bias.,Often, people buy themnas a kind of talisman, like:,"I bought this book. I won't ben'Predictably Irrational'.",(Laughter),It's like people want to hear the worst,,so psychologically, they can preparenfor it or defend against it.,It's why there isnsuch a market for pessimism.,But to think that by buying the bookngets you somewhere,,that's maybe the bigger fallacy.,It's just like the evidence that showsnthat the most dangerous people,are those who have been taughtnsome financial literacy.,They're the ones who go outnand make the worst mistakes.,It's the people who realizenthey don't know anything at all,,that end up doing pretty well.,A third problem with stories,is that outsidersnmanipulate us using stories,,and we all like to think advertisingnonly works on the other guy,,but, of course, that's not how it is,nadvertising works on all of us.,So if you're too attached to stories,,what will happen is peoplenselling products come along,,and they will bundlentheir product with a story.,You're like, "Hey, a free story!",And you end up buying the product,,because the productnand the story go together.,(Laugther),If you think about how capitalism works,,there is a bias here.,Let's consider two kindsnof stories about cars.,Story A is: "Buy this car,,and you will have beautiful, romanticnpartners and a fascinating life.",(Laughter),There are a lot of people,who have a financial incentivento promote that story.,But, say, the alternative story is:,"You don't actually need a carnas nice as your income would indicate.,What you usually do is looknat what your peers do and copy them.,That is a good heuristicnfor lots of problems,,but when it comes to cars,njust buy a Toyota.",(Laughter),Maybe Toyota has an incentive there,,but even Toyota is makingnmore money off the luxury cars,,and less money off the cheaper cars.,So if you think which set of storiesnyou end up hearing,,you end up hearing the glamor stories,nthe seductive stories,,and again I'm telling you,ndon't trust them.,There are people usingnyour love of stories to manipulate you.,Pull back and say:,"What are the messages,,what are the storiesnthat no one has an incentive to tell?",Start telling yourself those, and then seenif any of your decisions change.,That is one simple way.,You can never get out of the patternnof thinking in terms of stories,,but you can improve the extentnto which you think in stories,,and make some better decisions.,So if I'm thinking about this talk,nI'm wondering, of course,,what is it you take away from this talk?,What story do you take awaynfrom Tyler Cowen?,One story you might benlike the story of the quest.,"Tyler was a man on a quest.,Tyler came here, and he told usnnot to think so much in terms of stories.",That would be a storynyou could tell about this talk.,(Laughter),It would fit a pretty well-known pattern.,You might remember it.nYou could tell it to other people.,"This weird guy came, and he said,,'Don't think in terms of stories.nLet me tell you what happened today!'",(Laughter),And you tell your story.,(Laugther),Another possibility isnyou might tell a story of rebirth.,You might say, "I used to thinkntoo much in terms of stories,(Laughter),but then I heard Tyler Cowen,(Laughter),and now I think less in terms of stories!",That too is a narrative you will remember,,you can tell to other people,nand again, it may stick.,You also could tellna story of deep tragedy.,"This guy Tyler Cowen came,(Laughter),and he told us not to thinknin terms of stories,,but all he could do was tell us stories,(Laughter),about how other people thinkntoo much in terms of stories.",(Laughter),So, today, which is it?nIs it like quest, rebirth, tragedy?,Or maybe some combination of the three?,I'm really not sure,nand I'm not here to tell you,to burn your DVD playernand throw out your Tolstoy.,To think in terms of storiesnis fundamentally human.,There is a Gabriel Garcia Marqueznmemoir "Living to Tell the Tale",that we use memory in storiesnto make sense of what we've done,,to give meaning to our lives, to establishnconnections with other people.,None of this will go away,nshould go away, or can go away.,But again, as an economist,nI'm thinking about life on the margin,,the extra decision.,Should we think more in terms of stories,nor less in terms of stories?,When we hear stories,nshould we be more suspicious?,And what kind of storiesnshould we be suspicious of?,Again, I'm telling you it's the stories,nvery often, that you like the most,,that you find the most rewarding,nthe most inspiring.,The stories that don't focusnon opportunity cost,,or the complex, unintendednconsequences of human action,,because that very oftenndoes not make for a good story.,So often a story is a storynof triumph, a story of struggle;,there are opposing forces,nwhich are either evil or ignorant;,there is a person on a quest,nsomeone making a voyage,,and a stranger coming to town.,And those are your categories,nbut don't let them make you too happy.,(Laughter),As an alternative,,at the marginn- again, no burning of Tolstoy -,but just be a little more messy.,If I actually had to live those journeys,nand quests, and battles,,that would be so oppressive to me!,It's like, my goodness,ncan't I just have my life,in its messy, ordinary n- I hesitate to use the word - glory,but that it's fun for me?,Do I really have to follownsome kind of narrative?,Can't I just live?,So be more comfortable with messy.,Be more comfortable with agnostic,,and I mean this about the thingsnthat make you feel good.,It's so easy to pick outna few areas to be agnostic in,,and then feel good about it,,like, "I am agnosticnabout religion, or politics.",It's a kind of portfolio move you makento be more dogmatic elsewhere, right?,(Laughter),Sometimes,,the most intellectually trustworthy peoplenare the ones who pick one area,,and they are totally dogmatic in that,nso pig-headedly unreasonable,,that you think,n"How can they possibly believe that?",But it soaks up their stubbornness,,and then, on other things,nthey can be pretty open-minded.,So don't fall into the trap of thinkingnbecause you're agnostic on some things,,that you're being fundamentally reasonable,about your self-deception, your stories,nand your open-mindedness.,(Laughter),[Think about] this idea of hovering,nof epistemological hovering,,and messiness, and incompleteness,,[and how] not everything nties up into a neat bow,,and you're really not on a journey here.,You're here for somenmessy reason or reasons,,and maybe you don't know what it is,nand maybe I don't know what it is,,but anyway, I'm happy to be invited,nand thank you all for listening.,(Laughter),(Applause)When I was 10 years old,,a cousin of mine took me on a tour of his medical school.,And as a special treat,,he took me to the pathology lab,and took a real human brain,out of the jar,and placed it in my hands.,And there it was,,the seat of human consciousness,,the powerhouse of the human body,,sitting in my hands.,And that day I knew that when I grew up,,I was going to become a brain doctor,,scientist, something or the other. 
 Years later, when I finally grew up,,my dream came true.,And it was while I was doing my Ph.D.,on the neurological causes,of dyslexia in children,that I encountered a startling fact,that I'd like to share with you all today.,It is estimated that one in six children,,that's one in six children,,suffer from some developmental disorder.,This is a disorder that,retards mental development in the child,and causes permanent mental impairments.,Which means that each and every one of you here today,knows at least one child that is suffering,from a developmental disorder. 
 But here's what really perplexed me.,Despite the fact that each,and every one of these disorders,originates in the brain,,most of these disorders,are diagnosed solely on the basis,of observable behavior.,But diagnosing a brain disorder,without actually looking at the brain,is analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem,based on their physical symptoms,,without even doing an ECG or a chest X-ray,to look at the heart.,It seemed so intuitive to me.,To diagnose and treat a brain disorder accurately,,it would be necessary to look at the brain directly.,Looking at behavior alone,can miss a vital piece of the puzzle,and provide an incomplete, or even a misleading,,picture of the child's problems.,Yet, despite all the advances in medical technology,,the diagnosis of brain disorders,in one in six children,still remained so limited. 
 And then I came across a team at Harvard University,that had taken one such advanced medical technology,and finally applied it,,instead of in brain research,,towards diagnosing brain disorders in children.,Their groundbreaking technology,records the EEG, or the electrical activity,of the brain, in real time,,allowing us to watch the brain,as it performs various functions,and then detect even the slightest abnormality,in any of these functions:,vision, attention, language, audition.,A program called Brain Electrical,Activity Mapping,then triangulates the source,of that abnormality in the brain.,And another program called,Statistical Probability Mapping,then performs mathematical calculations,to determine whether any of these abnormalities,are clinically significant,,allowing us to provide a much more accurate,neurological diagnosis,of the child's symptoms.,And so I became the head of neurophysiology,for the clinical arm of this team,,and we're finally able to use this technology,towards actually helping,children with brain disorders.,And I'm happy to say that I'm now in the process,of setting up this technology here in India. 
 I'd like to tell you about one such child,,whose story was also covered by ABC News.,Seven-year-old Justin Senigar,came to our clinic with this diagnosis,of very severe autism.,Like many autistic children,,his mind was locked inside his body.,There were moments when he would,actually space out for seconds at a time.,And the doctors told his parents,he was never going to be able,to communicate or interact socially,,and he would probably never have too much language. 
 When we used this groundbreaking EEG technology,to actually look at Justin's brain,,the results were startling.,It turned out that Justin was almost,certainly not autistic.,He was suffering from brain seizures,that were impossible to see with the naked eye,,but that were actually causing symptoms,that mimicked those of autism.,After Justin was given anti-seizure medication,,the change in him was amazing.,Within a period of 60 days,,his vocabulary went from two to three words,to 300 words.,And his communication and social interaction,were improved so dramatically,that he was enrolled into a regular school,and even became a karate super champ. 
 Research shows that 50 percent of children,,almost 50 percent of children,diagnosed with autism,are actually suffering from hidden brain seizures.,These are the faces of the children,that I have tested,with stories just like Justin.,All these children,came to our clinic with a diagnosis,of autism, attention deficit disorder,,mental retardation, language problems.,Instead, our EEG scans revealed,very specific problems hidden within their brains,that couldn't possibly have been detected,by their behavioral assessments.,So these EEG scans,enabled us to provide these children,with a much more accurate neurological diagnosis,and much more targeted treatment. 
 For too long now, children with developmental disorders,have suffered from misdiagnosis,while their real problems have gone undetected,and left to worsen.,And for too long, these children and their parents,have suffered undue frustration and desperation.,But we are now in a new era of neuroscience,,one in which we can finally look,directly at brain function in real time,with no risks and no side effects, non-invasively,,and find the true source,of so many disabilities in children. 
 So if I could inspire,even a fraction of you in the audience today,to share this pioneering diagnostic approach,with even one parent whose child,is suffering from a developmental disorder,,then perhaps one more puzzle,in one more brain will be solved.,One more mind will be unlocked.,And one more child who has been misdiagnosed,or even undiagnosed by the system,will finally realize his or her true potential,while there's still time,for his or her brain to recover.,And all this by simply watching the child's brainwaves. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)If you think about the phone --,and Intel has tested,a lot of the things I'm going to show you,,over the last 10 years,,in about 600 elderly households --,300 in Ireland, and 300 in Portland --,trying to understand: How do we measure,and monitor behavior,in a medically meaningful way? 
 And if you think about the phone, right,,it's something that we can use for some incredible ways,to help people actually take the right medication at the right time.,We're testing these kinds of simple,sensor-network technologies in the home,so that any phone that a senior is already comfortable with,can help them deal with their medications.,And a lot of what they do is they pick up the phone,,and it's our system whispering to them which pill they need to take,,and they fake like they're having a conversation with a friend.,And they're not embarrassed by a meds caddy that's ugly,,that sits on their kitchen table and says,,"I'm old. I'm frail.",It's surreptitious technology,that's helping them do a simple task,of taking the right pill at the right time. 
 Now, we also do some pretty amazing things with these phones.,Because that moment when you answer the phone,is a cognitive test every time that you do it.,Think about it, all right? I'm going to answer the phone three different times.,"Hello? Hey.",All right? That's the first time.,"Hello? Uh, hey.","Hello? Uh, who?,Oh, hey.",All right? Very big differences,between the way I answered the phone the three times.,And as we monitor phone usage,by seniors over a long period of time,,down to the tenths of a microsecond,,that recognition moment,of whether they can figure out that person on the other end,is a friend and we start talking to them immediately,,or they do a lot of what's called trouble talk,,where they're like, "Wait, who is this? Oh." Right?,Waiting for that recognition moment,may be the best early indicator of the onset of dementia,than anything that shows up clinically today. 
 We call these behavioral markers.,There's lots of others. Is the person going to the phone,as quickly, when it rings, as they used to?,Is it a hearing problem or is it a physicality problem?,Has their voice gotten more quiet? We're doing a lot of work with people,with Alzheimer's and particularly with Parkinson's,,where that quiet voice that sometimes shows up with Parkinson's patients,may be the best early indicator,of Parkinson's five to 10 years before it shows up clinically.,But those subtle changes in your voice over a long period of time,are hard for you or your spouse to notice until it becomes so extreme,and your voice has become so quiet. 
 So, sensors are looking at that kind of voice.,When you pick up the phone,,how much tremor are you having,,and what is that like, and what is that trend like over a period of time?,Are you having more trouble dialing the phone than you used to?,Is it a dexterity problem? Is it the onset of arthritis?,Are you using the phone? Are you socializing less than you used to?,And looking at that pattern. And what does that decline in social health,mean, as a kind of a vital sign of the future?,And then wow, what a radical idea,,we -- except in the United States --,might be able to use this newfangled technology,to actually interact with a nurse or a doctor on the other end of the line.,Wow, what a great day that will be,once we're allowed to actually do those kinds of things. 
 So, these are what I would call behavioral markers.,And it's the whole field that we've been trying to work on,for the last 10 years at Intel.,How do you put simple disruptive technologies,,and the first of five phrases that I'm going to talk about in this talk?,Behavioral markers matter.,How do we change behavior?,How do we measure changes in behavior,in a meaningful way that's going to help us with,prevention of disease, early onset of disease,,and tracking the progression of disease over a long period of time? 
 Now, why would Intel let me,spend a lot of time and money, over the last 10 years,,trying to understand the needs of seniors,and start thinking about these kinds of behavioral markers?,This is some of the field work that we've done.,We have now lived with 1,000 elderly households,in 20 countries over the last 10 years.,We study people in Rochester, New York.,We go live with them in the winter,because what they do in the winter,,and their access to healthcare, and how much they socialize,,is very different than in the summer.,If they have a hip fracture we go with them,and we study their entire discharge experience.,If they have a family member who is a key part of their care network,,we fly and study them as well. 
 So, we study the holistic health experience,of 1,000 seniors over the last 10 years,in 20 different countries.,Why is Intel willing to fund that?,It's because of the second slogan that I want to talk about.,Ten years ago, when I started trying to convince Intel,to let me go start looking at disruptive technologies,that could help with independent living,,this is what I called it: "Y2K + 10." 
 You know, back in 2000,,we were all so obsessed with paying attention,to the aging of our computers,,and whether or not they were going to survive,the tick of the clock from 1999 to 2000,,that we missed a moment that only demographers were paying attention to.,It was right around New Years.,And that switchover,,when we had the larger number of older people on the planet,,for the first time than younger people.,For the first time in human history -- and barring aliens landing,or some major other pandemic,,that's the expectation from demographers, going forward. 
 And 10 years ago it seemed like I had a lot of time,to convince Intel to work on this. Right?,Y2K + 10 was coming,,the baby boomers starting to retire.,Well folks, it's like we know these demographics here.,This is a map of the entire world.,It's like the lights are on,,but nobody's home on this demographic,Y2K + 10 problem. Right?,I mean we sort of get it here, but we don't get it here,,and we're not doing anything about it. 
 The health reform bill is largely ignoring,the realities of the age wave that's coming,,and the implications for what we need to do to change,not only how we pay for care,,but deliver care in some radically different ways.,And in fact, it's upon us.,I mean you probably saw these headlines. This is Catherine Casey,who is the first boomer to actually get Social Security.,That actually occurred this year. She took early retirement.,She was born one second after midnight in 1946.,A retired school teacher,,there she is with a Social Security administrator.,The first boomer actually, we didn't even wait till 2011, next year.,We're already starting to see early retirement occur this year. 
 All right, so it's here. This Y2K + 10 problem is at our door.,This is 50 tsunamis scheduled on the calendar,,but somehow we can't sort of marshal our government,and innovative forces to sort of get out in front of it,and do something about it. We'll wait until,it's more of a catastrophe, and react,,as opposed to prepare for it.,So, one of the reasons it's so,challenging to prepare for this Y2K problem,is, I want to argue, we have what I would call,mainframe poisoning. 
 Andy Grove, about six or seven years ago,,he doesn't even know or remember this, in a Fortune Magazine article,he used the phrase "mainframe healthcare,",and I've been extending and expanding this.,He saw it written down somewhere. He's like, "Eric that's a really cool concept.",I was like, "Actually it was your idea. You said it in a Fortune Magazine article.,I just extended it.",You know, this is the mainframe. 
 This mentality of traveling to,and timesharing large, expensive healthcare systems,actually began in 1787.,This is the first general hospital in Vienna.,And actually the second general hospital in Vienna,,in about 1850, was where we started to build out,an entire curriculum for teaching med students specialties.,And it's a place in which we started developing,architecture that literally divided the body,,and divided care into departments and compartments.,And it was reflected in our architecture,,it was reflected in the way that we taught students,,and this mainframe mentality persists today. 
 Now, I'm not anti-hospital.,With my own healthcare problems, I've taken drug therapies,,I've traveled to this hospital and others, many, many times.,But we worship the high hospital on a hill. Right?,And this is mainframe healthcare.,And just as 30 years ago,we couldn't conceive that we would have the power,of a mainframe computer that took up a room this size,in our purses and on our belts,,that we're carrying around in our cell phone today,,and suddenly, computing,,that used to be an expert driven system,,it was a personal system that we all owned as part of our daily lives --,that shift from mainframe to personal computing,is what we have to do for healthcare.,We have to shift from this mainframe mentality of healthcare,to a personal model of healthcare. 
 We are obsessed with this way of thinking.,When Intel does surveys all around the world and we say,,"Quick response: healthcare.",The first word that comes up is "doctor.",The second that comes up is "hospital." And the third is "illness" or "sickness." Right?,We are wired, in our imagination, to think about healthcare,and healthcare innovation as something,that goes into that place.,Our entire health reform discussion right now,,health I.T., when we talk with policy makers,,equals "How are we going to get doctors using,electronic medical records in the mainframe?",We're not thinking about,how do we shift from the mainframe to the home.,And the problem with this is,the way we conceive healthcare. Right? 
 This is a very reactive, crisis-driven system.,We're doing 15-minute exams with patients.,It's population-based.,We collect a bunch of biological information in this artificial setting,,and we fix them up, like Humpty-Dumpty all over again,,and send them home,,and hope -- we might hand them a brochure, maybe an interactive website --,that they do as asked and don't come back into the mainframe. 
 And the problem is we can't afford it today, folks.,We can't afford mainframe healthcare today to include the uninsured.,And now we want to do a double-double,of the age wave coming through?,Business as usual in healthcare is broken and we've got to do something different.,We've got to focus on the home. 
 We've got to focus on a personal healthcare paradigm,that moves care to the home. How do we be more proactive,,prevention-driven?,How do we collect vital signs and other kinds of information 24 by 7?,How do we get a personal baseline about what's going to work for you?,How do we collect not just biological data,but behavioral data, psychological data,,relational data, in and on and around the home?,And how do we drive compliance to be a customized care plan,that uses all this great technology that's around us,to change our behavior?,That's what we need to do for our personal health model. 
 I want to give you a couple of examples. This is Mimi,from one of our studies --,in her 90s, had to move out of her home,because her family was worried about falls.,Raise your hand if you had a serious fall,in your household, or any of your loved ones,,your parents or so forth. Right?,Classic. Hip fracture often leads to institutionalization of a senior.,This is what was happening to Mimi; the family was worried about it,,moved her out of her own home into an assisted living facility.,She tripped over her oxygen tank. 
 Many people in this generation won't press the button,,even if they have an alert call system, because they don't want to bother anybody,,even though they've been paying 30 dollars a month.,Boomers will press the button. Trust me.,They're going to be pressing that button non-stop. Right? 
 Mimi broke her pelvis, lay all night, all morning,,finally somebody came in and found her,,sent her to the hospital.,They fixed her back up. She was never going to be able to move back,into the assisted living. They put her into the nursing home unit.,First night in the nursing home unit where she had been,in the same assisted living facility, moved her from one bed to another,,kind of threw her, rebroke her pelvis,,sent her back to the hospital that she had just come from,,no one read the chart, put her on Tylenol,,which she is allergic to, broke out, got bedsores,,basically, had heart problems, and died,from the fall and the complications and the errors that were there. 
 Now, the most frightening thing about this is,this is my wife's grandmother.,Now, I'm Eric Dishman. I speak English,,I work for Intel, I make a good salary,,I'm smart about falls and fall-related injuries --,it's an area of research that I work on.,I have access to senators and CEOs.,I can't stop this from happening.,What happens if you don't have money, you don't speak English,or don't have the kind of access,to deal with these kinds of problems that inevitably occur?,How do we actually prevent the vast majority of falls,from ever occurring in the first place? 
 Let me give you a quick example of work that we're doing,to try to do exactly that.,I've been wearing a little technology that we call Shimmer.,It's a research platform.,It has accelerometry. You can plug in a three-lead ECG.,There is all kinds of sort of plug-and-play,kind of Legos that you can do to capture, in the wild,,in the real world,,things like tremor, gait,,stride length and those kinds of things. 
 The problem is, our understanding of falls today,,like Mimi, is get a survey in the mail three months after you fell,,from the State, saying, "What were you doing when you fell?",That's sort of the state of the art.,But with something like Shimmer, or we have something called the Magic Carpet,,embedded sensors in carpet, or camera-based systems,that we borrowed from sports medicine,,we're starting for the first time in those 600 elderly households,to collect actual kinematic motion data,to understand: What are the subtle changes that are occurring,that can show us that mom has become risk at falls? 
 And most often we can do two interventions,,fix the meds mix.,I'm a qualitative researcher, but when I look at these data streams coming in,from these homes, I can look at the data and tell you the day,that some doctor prescribed them something that nobody else,knew that they were on, because we see the changes,in their patterns in the household. Right?,These discoveries of behavioral markers,,and behavioral changes,are game changing, and like the discovery of the microscope,because of our collecting data streams that we've actually never done before. 
 This is an example in our TRIL Clinic in Ireland,of -- actually what you're seeing is,she's looking at data,,in this picture, from the Magic Carpet.,So, we have a little carpet that you can look at your amount of postural sway,,and look at the changes in your postural sway over many months.,Here's what some of this data might look like.,This is actually sensor firings. 
 These are two different subjects in our study.,It's about a year's worth of data.,The color represents different rooms they are in the house.,This person on the left is living in their own home.,This person on the right is actually living in an assisted living facility.,I know this because look at how punctuated meal time is,when they are no longer in their particular rooms here. Right?,Now, this doesn't mean that much to you.,But when we look at these cycles of data,over a longer period of time -- and we're looking at everything from,motion around different rooms in the house,,to sort of micro-motions that Shimmer picks up,,about gait and stride length -- these streams of data,are starting to tell us things about behavioral patterns,that we've never understood before. 
 You can go to ORCATech.org --,it has nothing to do with whales, it's the Oregon Center for Aging and Technology --,to see more about that.,The problem is, Intel is still one of the largest,funders in the world,of independent living technology research.,I'm not bragging about how much we fund;,it's how little anyone else actually pays attention,to aging and funds innovation on aging,,chronic disease management and independent living in the home. 
 So, my mantra here, my fourth slogan is:,10,000 households or bust.,We need to drive,a national, if not international, Framingham-type heart study,of independent living technologies,,where we have 10,000 elderly connected households,with broadband, full medical characterization,,and a platform by which we can start to experiment,and turn these from 20-household anecdotal studies,that the universities fund,,to large clinical trials that prove out the value of these technologies.,So, 10,000 households or bust.,These are just some of the households that we've done in the Intel studies. 
 My fifth and final phrase:,I have tried for two years,,and there were moments when we were quite close,,to make this healthcare reform bill be about reform,from something and to something,,from a mainframe model,to a personal health model,,or to mean something more than just a debate,about the public option and how we're going to finance.,It doesn't matter how we finance healthcare.,We're going to figure something out,for the next 10 years, and try it.,No matter who pays for it,,we better start doing care in a fundamentally different way,and treating the home and the patient,and the family member and the caregivers,as part of these coordinated care teams,and using disruptive technologies that are already here,to do care in some pretty fundamental different ways. 
 The president needs to stand up and say,,at the end of a healthcare reform debate,,"Our goal as a country is to move 50 percent of care,out of institutions, clinics, hospitals and nursing homes,,to the home, in 10 years.",It's achievable. We should do it economically,,we should do it morally,,and we should do it for quality of life.,But there is no goal within this health reform.,It's just a mess today. 
 So, you know, that's my last message to you.,How do we set a going-to-the-moon goal,of dealing with the Y2K +10 problem that's coming?,It's not that innovation and technology is going to be the,magic pill that cures all, but it's going to be part of the solution.,And if we don't create a personal health movement,,something that we're all aiming towards in reform,,then we're going to move nowhere.,So, I hope you'll turn this conference into that kind of movement forward.,Thanks very much.,(Applause)So, what I'm going to do is,just give you the latest episode of India's --,maybe the world's -- longest running soap opera,,which is cricket.,And may it run forever, because it gives people like me a living.,It's got everything that you'd want a normal soap opera to want:,It's got love, joy, happiness,,sadness, tears, laughter,,lots of deceit, intrigue.,And like all good soaps, it jumps 20 years,when the audience interest changes.,And that's exactly what cricket has done.,It's jumped 20 years,into 20-over game.,And that's what I'm going to talk about,,how a small change,leads to a very big revolution. 
 But it wasn't always like that.,Cricket wasn't always this,speed-driven generations game.,There was a time when you played cricket,,you played timeless test matches,,when you played on till the game got over.,And there was this game in March 1939,that started on the third of March,and ended on the 14th of March.,And it only ended because the English cricketers,had to go from Durban to Cape Town,,which is a two-hour train journey,,to catch the ship that left on the 17th,,because the next ship wasn't around for a long time.,So, the match was ended in between.,And one of the English batsmen said, "You know what?,Another half an hour and we would have won.",(Laughter),Another half an hour after 12 days.,There were two Sundays in between. But of course, Sundays are church days,,so you don't play on Sundays. And one day it rained,,so they all sat around making friends with each other. 
 But there is a reason why India fell in love with cricket:,because we had about the same pace of life.,(Laughter),The Mahabharata was like that as well, wasn't it?,You fought by day, then it was sunset,,so everyone went back home.,And then you worked out your strategy,,and you came and fought the next day, and you went back home again.,The only difference between the Mahabharata and our cricket was,that in cricket, everybody was alive to come back and fight the next day.,Princes patronize the game,,not because they love the game,,but because it was a means of ingratiating themselves,to the British rulers. 
 But there is one other reason why India fell in love with cricket,,which was, all you needed was a plank of wood,and a rubber ball, and any number of people,could play it anywhere.,Take a look:,You could play it in the dump,with some rocks over there,,you could play it in a little alley --,you couldn't hit square anywhere, because the bat hit the wall;,don't forget the air conditioning and the cable wires.,(Laughter),You could play it on the banks of the Ganges --,that's as clean as the Ganges has been for a long time.,Or you could play many games in one small patch of land,,even if you didn't know which game you were actually in.,(Laughter),As you can see, you can play anywhere.,But slowly the game moved on,,you know, finally. 
 You don't always have five days. So, we moved on,,and we started playing 50-over cricket.,And then an enormous accident took place.,In Indian sport we don't make things happen,,accidents happen and we're in the right place at the right time, sometimes.,And we won this World Cup in 1983.,And suddenly we fell in love with the 50-over game,,and we played it virtually every day.,There was more 50-over cricket than anywhere. 
 But there was another big date.,1983 was when we won the World Cup.,1991,'92, we found a finance minister,and a prime minister,willing to let the world look at India,,rather than be this great country of intrigue,and mystery in this closed country.,And so we allowed multinationals into India.,We cut customs duties, we reduced import duties,,and we got all the multinationals coming in,,with multinational budgets,,who looked at per-capita income,and got very excited about the possibilities in India,,and were looking for a vehicle to reach every Indian. 
 And there are only two vehicles in India -- one real, one scripted.,The scripted one is what you see in the movies,,the real one was cricket.,And so one of my friends sitting right here in front of me,,Ravi Dhariwal from Pepsi, decided he's going to take it,all over the world.,And Pepsi was this big revolution, because they started taking cricket all over.,And so cricket started becoming big;,cricket started bringing riches in.,Television started covering cricket. For a long time,television said, "We won't cover cricket,unless you pay us to cover it.",Then they said, "OK,,the next rights are sold for 55 million dollars.,The next rights are sold for 612 million dollars.",So, it's a bit of a curve, that. 
 And then another big accident happened in our cricket.,England invented 20 overs cricket,,and said, "The world must play 20 overs cricket.",Just as England invented cricket, and made the rest of the world play it.,Thank God for them.,(Laughter),And so, India had to go and play the T20 World Cup, you see.,India didn't want to play the T20 World Cup.,But we were forced to play it by an 8-1 margin.,And then something very dramatic happened.,We got to the final, and then this moment,,that will remain enshrined forever,,for everybody, take a look. 
 (Crowd cheering) 
 The Pakistani batsman trying to clear the fielder. 
 Announcer: And Zishan takes it! India wins!,What a match for a Twenty20 final.,India, the world champions.,(Cheering),India, T20 champions.,But what a game we had, M. S. Dhoni,got it right in the air, but Misbah-ul-Haq, what a player.,A massive, massive success:,India, the world TT champions. 
 Harsha Bhogle: Suddenly India discovered this power of 20-overs cricket.,The accident, of course, there, was that the batsman,thought the bowler was bowling fast.,(Laughter),If he had bowled fast, the ball would have gone where it was meant to go,,but it didn't go. And we suddenly discovered,that we could be good at this game.,And what it also did was,it led to a certain pride in the fact that India could be the best in the world.,It was at a time when investment was coming in,,India was feeling a little more confident about itself.,And so there was a feeling that there was great pride,in what we can do.,And thankfully for all of us,,the English are very good at inventing things,,and then the gracious people that they are,,they let the world become very good at it.,(Laughter),And so England invented T20 cricket,,and allowed India to hijack it.,It was not like reengineering that we do in medicine,,we just took it straight away, as is.,(Laughter) 
 And so, we launched our own T20 league.,Six weeks, city versus city.,It was a new thing for us. We had only ever supported our country --,the only two areas in which India was very proud about,their country, representing itself on the field.,One was war, the Indian army, which we don't like to happen very often.,The other was Indian cricket.,Now, suddenly we had to support city leagues.,But the people getting into these city leagues,were people who were taking their cues from the West.,America is a home of leagues. And they said,,"Right, we'll build some glitzy leagues here in India.",But was India ready for it?,Because cricket, for a long time in India was always organized.,It was never promoted, it was never sold -- it was organized.,And look what they did with our beautiful, nice,,simple family game.,All of a sudden, you had that happening. 
 (Music) 
 An opening ceremony to match every other.,This was an India that was buying Corvettes. This was an India that was buying Jaguar.,This was an India that was adding more mobile phones per month,than New Zealand's population twice over.,So, it was a different India.,But it was also a slightly more orthodox India,that was very happy to be modern,,but didn't want to say that to people.,And so, they were aghast when the cheerleaders arrived.,Everyone secretly watched them, but everyone claimed not to. 
 (Music) 
 (Laughter) 
 The new owners of Indian cricket were not the old princes.,They were not bureaucrats who were forced,into sport because they didn't actually love it;,these were people who ran serious companies.,And so they started promoting cricket big time,,started promoting clubs big time.,And they've started promoting them with huge money behind it.,I mean the IPL had 2.3 billion dollars,before a ball was bowled,,1.6 billion dollars for television revenue over 10 years,,and another 70 million dollars plus from all these franchises,that were putting in money. And then they had to appeal to their cities,,but they had to do it like the West, right? Because we are setting up leagues.,But what they were very good at doing,was making it very localized.,So, just to give you an example of how they did it --,not Manchester United style promotion,,but very Mumbai style promotion. Take a look. 
 (Music) 
 Of course, a lot of people said, "Maybe they dance better than they play.",(Laughter),But that's all right. What it did also is it changed the way we looked at cricket.,All along, if you wanted a young cricketer,,you picked him up from the bylanes of your own little locality,,your own city, and you were very proud,of the system that produced those cricketers.,Now, all of the sudden, if you were to bowl a shot --,if Mumbai were to bowl a shot, for example,,they needn't go to Kalbadevi,or Shivaji Park or somewhere to source them,,they could go to Trinidad.,This was the new India, wasn't it? This was the new world,,where you can source from anywhere,as long as you get the best product at the best price.,And all of a sudden, Indian sport had awakened to the reality,that you can source the best product for the best price,anywhere in the world. 
 So, the Mumbai Indians flew in Dwayne Bravo from Trinidad and Tobago,,overnight. And when he had to go back to represent,the West Indies, they asked him, "When do you have to reach?",He said, "I have to be there by a certain time, so I have to leave today.",We said, "No, no, no. It's not about when you have to leave;,it's about when do you have to reach there?",And so he said, "I've got to reach on date X.",And they said, "Fine, you play to date X, minus one.",So, he played in Hyderabad, went, straight after the game,,went from the stadium to Hyderabad airport,,sat in a private corporate jet -- first refueling in Portugal,,second refueling in Brazil; he was in West Indies in time.,(Laughter),Never would India have thought on this scale before.,Never would India have said, "I want a player to play,one game for me, and I will use a corporate jet,to send him all the way back to Kingston, Jamaica,to play a game.",And I just thought to myself,,"Wow, we've arrived somewhere in the world, you know?,We have arrived somewhere. We are thinking big." 
 But what this also did was it started,marrying the two most important things in Indian cricket,,which is cricket and the movies in Indian entertainment.,There is cricket and the movies.,And they came together because people in the movies,now started owning clubs.,And so, people started going to the cricket to watch Preity Zinta.,They started going to the cricket to watch Shah Rukh Khan.,And something very interesting happened.,We started getting song and dance in Indian cricket.,And so it started resembling the Indian movies more and more.,And of course, if you were on Preity Zinta's team --,as you will see on the clip that follows -- if you did well,,you got a hug from Preity Zinta.,So that was the ultimate reason to do well. Take a look --,everyone's watching Preity Zinta. 
 (Music) 
 And then of course there was Shah Rukh playing the Kolkata crowd.,We'd all seen matches in Kolkata,,but we'd never seen anything like this:,Shah Rukh, with the Bengali song, getting the audiences all worked up,for Kolkata -- not for India, but for Kolkata.,But take a look at this. 
 (Music) 
 An Indian film star hugging a Pakistani cricketer,because they'd won in Kolkata.,Can you imagine?,And do you know what the Pakistani cricketer said?,(Applause),"I wish I was playing for Preity Zinta's team." 
 (Laughter) 
 But I thought I'd take this opportunity --,there's a few people from Pakistan in here.,I'm so happy that you're here,because I think we can show that we can both be together and be friends, right?,We can play cricket together, we can be friends.,So thank you very much for coming, all of you from Pakistan. 
 (Applause) 
 There was criticism too because they said,,"Players are being bought and sold?,Are they grain?,Are they cattle?",Because we had this auction, you see.,How do you fix a price for a player?,And so the auction that followed,literally had people saying,,"Bang! so many million dollars for so-and-so player.",There it is. 
 (Music) 
 Auctioneer: Going at 1,500,000 dollars. Chennai.,Shane Warne sold for 450,000 dollars. 
 HB: Suddenly, a game which earned its players 50 rupees a day --,so 250 rupees for a test match,,but if you finish in four days you only got 200.,The best Indian players who played every test match --,every one of the internationals, the top of the line players --,standard contracts are 220,000 dollars in a whole year.,Now they were getting 500,000 for six days' work.,Then Andrew Flintoff came by from England,,he got one and a half million dollars, and he went back and said,,"For four weeks, I'm earning more than Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard,,and I'm earning more than the footballers, wow.",And where was he earning it from? From a little club in India.,Could you have imagined that day would come?,One and a half million dollars for six weeks' work.,That's not bad, is it? 
 So, at 2.3 billion dollars before the first ball was bowled.,What India was doing, though, was benchmarking,itself against the best in the world,,and it became a huge brand.,Lalit Modi was on the cover of Business Today.,IPL became the biggest brand in India,and, because our elections, had to be moved to South Africa,,and we had to start the tournament in three weeks.,Move a whole tournament to South Africa in three weeks.,But we did it. You know why?,Because no country works as slowly as we do,till three weeks before an event,,and nobody works fast as we do in the last three weeks. 
 (Applause) 
 Our population, which for a long time we thought was a problem,,suddenly became our biggest asset,because there were more people watching --,the huge consuming class --,everybody came to watch the cricket.,We'd also made cricket the only sport in India,,which is a pity, but in India every other sport,pushes cricket to become big,,which is a bit of a tragedy of our times. 
 Now, this last minute before I go --,there's a couple of side effects of all this.,For a long time, India was this country of poverty,,dust, beggars,,snake charmers, filth,,Delhi belly -- people heard Delhi belly stories before they came.,And, all of a sudden, India was this land of opportunity.,Cricketers all over the world said,,"You know, we love India. We love to play in India.",And that felt good, you know?,We said, "The dollar's quite powerful actually.",Can you imagine, you've got the dollar on view,and there's no Delhi belly in there anymore.,There's no filth, there's no beggars, all the snake charmers have vanished,,everybody's gone. This tells you how the capitalist world rules. 
 Right so, finally,,an English game that India usurped a little bit,,but T20 is going to be the next missionary in the world.,If you want to take the game around the world,,it's got to be the shortest form of the game.,You can't take a timeless test to China and sit through 14 days with no result in the end,,or you can't take it all over the world.,So that's what T20 is doing.,Hopefully, it'll make everyone richer, hopefully it'll make the game bigger,and hopefully it'll give cricket commentators more time in the business. 
 Thank you very much. Thank you. 
 (Applause)So, I was just asked to go and shoot this film called "Elizabeth.",And we're all talking about this great English icon and saying,,"She's a fantastic woman, she does everything.,How are we going to introduce her?",So we went around the table with the studio and the producers and the writer,,and they came to me and said, "Shekhar, what do you think?" 
 And I said, "I think she's dancing." 
 And I could see everybody looked at me,,somebody said, "Bollywood." 
 The other said, "How much did we hire him for?" 
 And the third said, "Let's find another director." 
 I thought I had better change.,So we had a lot of discussion on how to introduce Elizabeth,,and I said, "OK, maybe I am too Bollywood.,Maybe Elizabeth, this great icon, dancing?,What are you talking about?",So I rethought the whole thing,,and then we all came to a consensus.,And here was the introduction of this,great British icon called "Elizabeth." 
 Leicester: May I join you, my lady? 
 Elizabeth: If it please you, sir.,(Music) 
 Shekhar Kapur: So she was dancing.,So how many people who saw the film did not get,that here was a woman in love,,that she was completely innocent,and saw great joy in her life, and she was youthful?,And how many of you did not get that?,That's the power of visual storytelling,,that's the power of dance, that's the power of music:,the power of not knowing. 
 When I go out to direct a film,,every day we prepare too much, we think too much.,Knowledge becomes a weight upon wisdom.,You know, simple words lost,in the quicksand of experience.,So I come up, and I say,,"What am I going to do today?" I'm not going to do what I planned to do,,and I put myself into absolute panic.,It's my one way of getting rid of my mind,,getting rid of this mind that says,,"Hey, you know what you're doing. You know exactly what you're doing.,You're a director, you've done it for years.",So I've got to get there,and be in complete panic.,It's a symbolic gesture. I tear up the script,,I go and I panic myself, I get scared.,I'm doing it right now; you can watch me. I'm getting nervous,,I don't know what to say, I don't know what I'm doing, I don't want to go there. 
 And as I go there, of course, my A.D. says,,"You know what you're going to do, sir." I say, "Of course I do." 
 And the studio executives, they would say,,"Hey, look at Shekhar. He's so prepared.",And inside I've just been listening to Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan,because he's chaotic.,I'm allowing myself to go into chaos,because out of chaos, I'm hoping some moments of truth will come.,All preparation is preparation.,I don't even know if it's honest.,I don't even know if it's truthful.,The truth of it all comes on the moment, organically,,and if you get five great moments,of great, organic stuff,in your storytelling, in your film,,your film, audiences will get it.,So I'm looking for those moments, and I'm standing there,and saying, "I don't know what to say." 
 So, ultimately, everybody's looking at you,,200 people at seven in the morning,who got there at quarter to seven, and you arrived at seven,,and everybody's saying,,"Hey. What's the first thing? What's going to happen?",And you put yourself into a state of panic,where you don't know, and so you don't know.,And so, because you don't know,,you're praying to the universe because you're praying to the universe,that something -- I'm going to try and access the universe,the way Einstein -- say a prayer --,accessed his equations,,the same source. I'm looking for the same source,because creativity comes from absolutely the same source,that you meditate somewhere outside yourself,,outside the universe.,You're looking for something that comes and hits you.,Until that hits you, you're not going to do the first shot.,So what do you do? 
 So Cate says, "Shekhar, what do you want me to do?" 
 And I say, "Cate, what do you want to do?" (Laughter),"You're a great actor, and I like to give to my actors --,why don't you show me what you want to do?",(Laughter),What am I doing? I'm trying to buy time.,I'm trying to buy time. 
 So the first thing about storytelling that I learned,,and I follow all the time is: Panic.,Panic is the great access of creativity,because that's the only way to get rid of your mind.,Get rid of your mind.,Get out of it, get it out.,And let's go to the universe because,there's something out there that is more,truthful than your mind,,that is more truthful than your universe.,[unclear], you said that yesterday. I'm just repeating it,because that's what I follow constantly,to find the shunyata somewhere, the emptiness.,Out of the emptiness comes a moment of creativity.,So that's what I do. 
 When I was a kid -- I was about eight years old.,You remember how India was. There was no pollution.,In Delhi, we used to live -- we used to call it a chhat or the khota.,Khota's now become a bad word. It means their terrace --,and we used to sleep out at night.,At school I was being just taught about physics,,and I was told that,if there is something that exists,,then it is measurable.,If it is not measurable,,it does not exist.,And at night I would lie out, looking at the unpolluted sky,,as Delhi used to be at that time when I was a kid,,and I used to stare at the universe and say,,"How far does this universe go?" 
 My father was a doctor.,And I would think, "Daddy, how far does the universe go?" 
 And he said, "Son, it goes on forever." 
 So I said, "Please measure forever,because in school they're teaching me,that if I cannot measure it, it does not exist.,It doesn't come into my frame of reference.",So, how far does eternity go?,What does forever mean?,And I would lie there crying at night,because my imagination could not touch creativity. 
 So what did I do?,At that time, at the tender age of seven,,I created a story.,What was my story?,And I don't know why, but I remember the story.,There was a woodcutter,who's about to take his ax and chop a piece of wood,,and the whole galaxy is one atom of that ax.,And when that ax hits that piece of wood,,that's when everything will destroy,and the Big Bang will happen again.,But all before that there was a woodcutter.,And then when I would run out of that story,,I would imagine that woodcutter's universe,is one atom in the ax of another woodcutter.,So every time, I could tell my story again and again,and get over this problem,,and so I got over the problem. 
 How did I do it? Tell a story.,So what is a story?,A story is our -- all of us --,we are the stories we tell ourselves.,In this universe, and this existence,,where we live with this duality,of whether we exist or not,and who are we,,the stories we tell ourselves are the stories,that define the potentialities,of our existence.,We are the stories we tell ourselves.,So that's as wide as we look at stories.,A story is the relationship,that you develop between who you are,,or who you potentially are,,and the infinite world, and that's our mythology. 
 We tell our stories,,and a person without a story does not exist.,So Einstein told a story,and followed his stories and came up with theories,and came up with theories and then came up with his equations.,Alexander had a story that his mother used to tell him,,and he went out to conquer the world.,We all, everybody, has a story that they follow.,We tell ourselves stories.,So, I will go further, and I say,,"I tell a story, and therefore I exist.",I exist because there are stories,,and if there are no stories, we don't exist.,We create stories to define our existence.,If we do not create the stories,,we probably go mad.,I don't know; I'm not sure, but that's what I've done all the time. 
 Now, a film.,A film tells a story.,I often wonder when I make a film -- I'm thinking of making a film of the Buddha --,and I often wonder: If Buddha had all the elements,that are given to a director --,if he had music, if he had visuals, if he had a video camera --,would we get Buddhism better?,But that puts some kind of burden on me.,I have to tell a story,in a much more elaborate way,,but I have the potential.,It's called subtext.,When I first went to Hollywood, they said --,I used to talk about subtext, and my agent came to me,,"Would you kindly not talk about subtext?",And I said, "Why?" He said, "Because nobody is going to give you a film,if you talk about subtext.,Just talk about plot,and say how wonderful you'll shoot the film,,what the visuals will be." 
 So when I look at a film,,here's what we look for:,We look for a story on the plot level,,then we look for a story,on the psychological level,,then we look for a story on the political level,,then we look at a story,on a mythological level.,And I look for stories on each level.,Now, it is not necessary,that these stories agree with each other.,What is wonderful is,,at many times, the stories will contradict with each other.,So when I work with Rahman who's a great musician,,I often tell him, "Don't follow what the script already says.,Find that which is not.,Find the truth for yourself,,and when you find the truth for yourself,,there will be a truth in it, but it may contradict the plot,,but don't worry about it." 
 So, the sequel to "Elizabeth," "Golden Age.",When I made the sequel to "Elizabeth," here was a story that,the writer was telling:,A woman who was threatened,by Philip II,and was going to war,,and was going to war, fell in love with Walter Raleigh.,Because she fell in love with Walter Raleigh,,she was giving up the reasons she was a queen,,and then Walter Raleigh,fell in love with her lady in waiting,,and she had to decide whether she was a queen going to war,or she wanted... 
 Here's the story I was telling:,The gods up there,,there were two people.,There was Philip II, who was divine,because he was always praying,,and there was Elizabeth, who was divine,,but not quite divine because she thought she was divine,,but the blood of being mortal flowed in her.,But the divine one was unjust,,so the gods said,,"OK, what we need to do is,help the just one.",And so they helped the just one.,And what they did was, they sent Walter Raleigh down,to physically separate her mortal self,from her spirit self.,And the mortal self was the girl,that Walter Raleigh was sent,,and gradually he separated her,so she was free to be divine.,And the two divine people fought,,and the gods were on the side of divinity. 
 Of course, all the British press got really upset.,They said, "We won the Armada." 
 But I said, "But the storm won the Armada.,The gods sent the storm." 
 So what was I doing?,I was trying to find a mythic reason,to make the film.,Of course, when I asked Cate Blanchett, I said, "What's the film about?",She said, "The film's about a woman,coming to terms with growing older.",Psychological.,The writer said "It's about history, plot.",I said "It's about mythology,,the gods." 
 So let me show you a film --,a piece from that film --,and how a camera also --,so this is a scene, where in my mind,,she was at the depths of mortality.,She was discovering what mortality actually means,,and if she is at the depths of mortality,,what really happens.,And she's recognizing the dangers of mortality,and why she should break away from mortality.,Remember, in the film, to me,,both her and her lady in waiting,were parts of the same body,,one the mortal self,and one the spirit self. 
 So can we have that second? 
 (Music) 
 Elizabeth: Bess?,Bess?,Bess Throckmorton? 
 Bess: Here, my lady. 
 Elizabeth: Tell me, is it true?,Are you with child?,Are you with child? 
 Bess: Yes, my lady. 
 Elizabeth: Traitorous.,You dare to keep secrets from me?,You ask my permission before you rut,,before you breed.,My bitches wear my collars.,Do you hear me? Do you hear me? 
 Walsingham: Majesty. Please, dignity. Mercy. 
 Elizabeth: This is no time for mercy, Walsingham.,You go to your traitor brother and leave me to my business.,Is it his?,Tell me. Say it. Is the child his? Is it his? 
 Bess: Yes.,My lady,,it is my husband's child.,Elizabeth: Bitch! (Cries) 
 Raleigh: Majesty.,This is not the queen I love and serve. 
 Elizabeth: This man has seduced a ward of the queen,,and she has married without royal consent.,These offenses are punishable by law. Arrest him.,Go.,You no longer have the queen's protection. 
 Bess: As you wish, Majesty. 
 Elizabeth: Get out! Get out! Get out!,Get out. 
 (Music) 
 Shekhar Kapur: So, what am I trying to do here?,Elizabeth has realized,,and she's coming face-to-face,with her own sense of jealousy,,her own sense of mortality.,What am I doing with the architecture?,The architecture is telling a story.,The architecture is telling a story,about how, even though she's the most powerful woman,in the world at that time,,there is the other, the architecture's bigger.,The stone is bigger than her because stone is an organic.,It'll survive her.,So it's telling you, to me, stone is part of her destiny.,Not only that, why is the camera looking down?,The camera's looking down at her because she's in the well.,She's in the absolute well,of her own sense of being mortal.,That's where she has to pull herself out,from the depths of mortality,,come in, release her spirit.,And that's the moment where, in my mind,,both Elizabeth and Bess are the same person.,But that's the moment,she's surgically removing herself from that.,So the film is operating on,many many levels in that scene.,And how we tell stories,visually, with music, with actors,,and at each level it's a different sense,and sometimes contradictory to each other.,So how do I start all this?,What's the process of telling a story? 
 About ten years ago,,I heard this little thing from a politician,,not a politician that was very well respected in India.,And he said that these people in the cities,,in one flush, expend as much water,as you people in the rural areas,don't get for your family for two days.,That struck a chord, and I said, "That's true.",I went to see a friend of mine,,and he made me wait,in his apartment in Malabar Hill,on the twentieth floor,,which is a really, really upmarket area in Mumbai.,And he was having a shower for 20 minutes.,I got bored and left, and as I drove out,,I drove past the slums of Bombay,,as you always do,,and I saw lines and lines in the hot midday sun,of women and children with buckets,waiting for a tanker,to come and give them water.,And an idea started to develop.,So how does that become a story?,I suddenly realized that we are heading towards disaster. 
 So my next film is called "Paani",which means water.,And now, out of the mythology of that,,I'm starting to create a world.,What kind of world do I create,,and where does the idea, the design of that come?,So, in my mind, in the future,,they started to build flyovers.,You understand flyovers? Yeah?,They started to build flyovers,to get from A to B faster,,but they effectively went from one area of relative wealth,to another area of relative wealth.,And then what they did was,they created a city above the flyovers.,And the rich people moved to the upper city,and left the poorer people in the lower cities,,about 10 to 12 percent of the people,have moved to the upper city. 
 Now, where does this upper city and lower city come?,There's a mythology in India about --,where they say, and I'll say it in Hindi,,[Hindi],Right. What does that mean?,It says that the rich are always sitting on the shoulders,and survive on the shoulders of the poor.,So, from that mythology, the upper city and lower city come.,So the design has a story. 
 And now, what happens is that the people of the upper city,,they suck up all the water.,Remember the word I said, suck up.,They suck up all the water, keep to themselves,,and they drip feed the lower city.,And if there's any revolution, they cut off the water.,And, because democracy still exists,,there's a democratic way in which you say,"Well, if you give us what [we want], we'll give you water." 
 So, okay my time is up.,But I can go on about telling you,how we evolve stories,,and how stories effectively are who we are,and how these get translated into the particular discipline,that I am in, which is film.,But ultimately, what is a story? It's a contradiction.,Everything's a contradiction.,The universe is a contradiction.,And all of us are constantly looking for harmony.,When you get up, the night and day is a contradiction.,But you get up at 4 a.m.,That first blush of blue is where the night and day,are trying to find harmony with each other.,Harmony is the notes that Mozart didn't give you,,but somehow the contradiction of his notes suggest that.,All contradictions of his notes suggest the harmony.,It's the effect of looking for harmony,in the contradiction that exists in a poet's mind,,a contradiction that exists in a storyteller's mind.,In a storyteller's mind, it's a contradiction of moralities.,In a poet's mind, it's a conflict of words,,in the universe's mind, between day and night.,In the mind of a man and a woman,,we're looking constantly at,the contradiction between male and female,,we're looking for harmony within each other. 
 The whole idea of contradiction,,but the acceptance of contradiction,is the telling of a story, not the resolution.,The problem with a lot of the storytelling in Hollywood,and many films, and as [unclear] was saying in his,,that we try to resolve the contradiction.,Harmony is not resolution.,Harmony is the suggestion of a thing,that is much larger than resolution.,Harmony is the suggestion of something,that is embracing and universal,and of eternity and of the moment.,Resolution is something that is far more limited.,It is finite; harmony is infinite.,So that storytelling, like all other contradictions in the universe,,is looking for harmony and infinity,in moral resolutions, resolving one, but letting another go,,letting another go and creating a question that is really important. 
 Thank you very much.,(Applause)(Music) 
 [Sanskrit],This is an ode to the mother goddess,,that most of us in India learn when we are children.,I learned it when I was four,at my mother's knee.,That year she introduced me to dance,,and thus began,my tryst with classical dance.,Since then -- it's been four decades now --,I've trained with the best in the field,,performed across the globe,,taught young and old alike,,created, collaborated,,choreographed,,and wove a rich tapestry,of artistry, achievement and awards.,The crowning glory was in 2007,,when I received this country's,fourth highest civilian award, the Padma Shri,,for my contribution to art. 
 (Applause) 
 But nothing, nothing prepared me,for what I was to hear,on the first of July 2008.,I heard the word "carcinoma.",Yes, breast cancer.,As I sat dumbstruck in my doctor's office,,I heard other words:,"cancer," "stage," "grade.",Until then, Cancer was the zodiac,sign of my friend,,stage was what I performed on,,and grades were what I got in school.,That day, I realized,I had an unwelcome, uninvited,,new life partner.,As a dancer,,I know the nine rasas or the navarasas:,anger, valor,,disgust, humor,and fear.,I thought I knew what fear was.,That day, I learned what fear was. 
 Overcome with the enormity of it all,and the complete feeling of loss of control,,I shed copious tears,and asked my dear husband, Jayant.,I said, "Is this it? Is this the end of the road?,Is this the end of my dance?",And he, the positive soul that he is,,said, "No, this is just a hiatus,,a hiatus during the treatment,,and you'll get back to doing what you do best." 
 I realized then,that I, who thought I had complete control of my life,,had control of only three things:,My thought, my mind --,the images that these thoughts created --,and the action that derived from it.,So here I was wallowing,in a vortex of emotions,and depression and what have you,,with the enormity of the situation,,wanting to go to a place of healing, health and happiness.,I wanted to go from where I was,to where I wanted to be,,for which I needed something.,I needed something that would pull me out of all this.,So I dried my tears,,and I declared to the world at large ...,I said, "Cancer's only one page in my life,,and I will not allow this page to impact the rest of my life." 
 I also declared to the world at large,that I would ride it out,,and I would not allow cancer to ride me.,But to go from where I was,to where I wanted to be,,I needed something.,I needed an anchor, an image,,a peg,to peg this process on,,so that I could go from there.,And I found that in my dance,,my dance, my strength, my energy, my passion,,my very life breath.,But it wasn't easy.,Believe me, it definitely wasn't easy.,How do you keep cheer,when you go from beautiful,to bald in three days?,How do you not despair,when, with the body ravaged by chemotherapy,,climbing a mere flight of stairs was sheer torture,,that to someone like me who could dance for three hours?,How do you not get overwhelmed,by the despair and the misery of it all?,All I wanted to do was curl up and weep.,But I kept telling myself fear and tears,are options I did not have. 
 So I would drag myself into my dance studio --,body, mind and spirit -- every day into my dance studio,,and learn everything I learned,when I was four, all over again,,reworked, relearned, regrouped.,It was excruciatingly painful, but I did it.,Difficult.,I focused on my mudras,,on the imagery of my dance,,on the poetry and the metaphor,and the philosophy of the dance itself.,And slowly, I moved out,of that miserable state of mind. 
 But I needed something else.,I needed something to go that extra mile,,and I found it in that metaphor,which I had learned from my mother when I was four.,The metaphor of Mahishasura Mardhini,,of Durga.,Durga, the mother goddess, the fearless one,,created by the pantheon of Hindu gods.,Durga, resplendent, bedecked, beautiful,,her 18 arms,ready for warfare,,as she rode astride her lion,into the battlefield to destroy Mahishasur.,Durga, the epitome,of creative feminine energy,,or shakti.,Durga, the fearless one.,I made that image of Durga,and her every attribute, her every nuance,,my very own. 
 Powered by the symbology of a myth,and the passion of my training,,I brought laser-sharp focus into my dance,,laser-sharp focus to such an extent,that I danced a few weeks after surgery.,I danced through chemo and radiation cycles,,much to the dismay of my oncologist.,I danced between chemo and radiation cycles,and badgered him to fit it,to my performing dance schedule.,What I had done,is I had tuned out of cancer,and tuned into my dance.,Yes, cancer has just been one page in my life. 
 My story,is a story of overcoming setbacks,,obstacles and challenges,that life throws at you.,My story is the power of thought.,My story is the power of choice.,It's the power of focus.,It's the power of bringing ourselves,to the attention of something that so animates you,,so moves you,,that something even like cancer becomes insignificant.,My story is the power of a metaphor.,It's the power of an image.,Mine was that of Durga,,Durga the fearless one.,She was also called Simhanandini,,the one who rode the lion. 
 As I ride out,,as I ride my own inner strength,,my own inner resilience,,armed as I am with what medication can provide,and continue treatment,,as I ride out into the battlefield of cancer,,asking my rogue cells to behave,,I want to be known not as a cancer survivor,,but as a cancer conqueror. 
 I present to you an excerpt of that work,"Simhanandini." 
 (Applause) 
 (Music) 
 (Applause)I want to talk about 4.6 billion years of history,in 18 minutes.,That's 300 million years per minute.,Let's start with the first photograph NASA obtained,of planet Mars.,This is fly-by, Mariner IV.,It was taken in 1965.,When this picture appeared,,that well-known scientific journal,,The New York Times, wrote in its editorial,,"Mars is uninteresting.,It's a dead world. NASA should not spend,any time or effort studying Mars anymore.",Fortunately, our leaders in Washington,at NASA headquarters knew better,and we began a very extensive study,of the red planet. 
 One of the key questions in all of science,,"Is there life outside of Earth?",I believe that Mars is the most likely target,for life outside the Earth.,I'm going to show you in a few minutes,some amazing measurements that suggest,there may be life on Mars.,But let me start with a Viking photograph.,This is a composite taken by Viking in 1976.,Viking was developed and managed at the,NASA Langley Research Center.,We sent two orbiters and two landers in the summer of 1976.,We had four spacecraft, two around Mars,,two on the surface --,an amazing accomplishment. 
 This is the first photograph taken from,the surface of any planet.,This is a Viking Lander photograph,of the surface of Mars.,And yes, the red planet is red.,Mars is half the size of the Earth,,but because two-thirds of the Earth is covered by water,,the land area on Mars,is comparable to the land area on Earth.,So, Mars is a pretty big place even though it's half the size.,We have obtained topographic measurements,of the surface of Mars. We understand,the elevation differences. 
 We know a lot about Mars.,Mars has the largest volcano in the solar system,,Olympus Mons.,Mars has the Grand Canyon,of the solar system, Valles Marineris.,Very, very interesting planet.,Mars has the largest,impact crater in the solar system,,Hellas Basin.,This is 2,000 miles across.,If you happened to be on Mars,when this impactor hit,,it was a really bad day on Mars.,(Laughter),This is Olympus Mons.,This is bigger than the state of Arizona. 
 Volcanoes are important, because volcanoes,produce atmospheres and they produce oceans.,We're looking at Valles Marineris,,the largest canyon in the solar system,,superimposed on a map of the United States,,3,000 miles across.,One of the most intriguing features about Mars,,the National Academy of Science says,one of the 10 major mysteries of the space age,,is why certain areas of Mars,are so highly magnetized.,We call this crustal magnetism.,There are regions on Mars, where, for some reason --,we don't understand why at this point --,the surface is very, very highly magnetized. 
 Is there water on Mars?,The answer is no, there is no liquid water,on the surface of Mars today.,But there is intriguing evidence,that suggests that the early history of Mars,there may have been rivers,and fast flowing water.,Today Mars is very very dry.,We believe there's some water in the polar caps,,there are polar caps of North Pole and South Pole.,Here are some recent images.,This is from Spirit and Opportunity.,These images that show at one time,,there was very fast flowing water on the surface of Mars.,Why is water important? Water is important,because if you want life you have to have water.,Water is the key ingredient,in the evolution, the origin of life on a planet. 
 Here is some picture of Antarctica,and a picture of Olympus Mons,,very similar features, glaciers.,So, this is frozen water.,This is ice water on Mars.,This is my favorite picture. This was just taken a few weeks ago.,It has not been seen publicly.,This is European space agency,Mars Express, image of a crater on Mars,and in the middle of the crater,we have liquid water, we have ice.,Very intriguing photograph. 
 We now believe that in the early history of Mars,,which is 4.6 billion years ago,,4.6 billion years ago, Mars was very Earth-like.,Mars had rivers, Mars had lakes,,but more important Mars had planetary-scale oceans.,We believe that the oceans were in the northern hemisphere,,and this area in blue,,which shows a depression of about four miles,,was the ancient ocean area,on the surface of Mars.,Where did the ocean's worth of water on Mars go?,Well, we have an idea.,This is a measurement we obtained a few years ago,from a Mars-orbiting satellite called Odyssey.,Sub-surface water on Mars,,frozen in the form of ice.,And this shows the percent. If it's a blueish color,,it means 16 percent by weight.,Sixteen percent, by weight, of the interior,contains frozen water, or ice.,So, there is a lot of water below the surface. 
 The most intriguing and puzzling measurement,,in my opinion, we've obtained of Mars,,was released earlier this year,in the magazine Science.,And what we're looking at is the presence of the gas methane,,CH4, in the atmosphere of Mars.,And you can see there are three distinct regions of methane.,Why is methane important?,Because on Earth, almost all --,99.9 percent -- of the methane,is produced by living systems,,not little green men, but microscopic life,below the surface or at the surface.,We now have evidence,that methane is in the atmosphere of Mars,,a gas that, on Earth,,is biogenic in origin,,produced by living systems.,These are the three plumes: A, B1, B2. 
 And this is the terrain it appears over,,and we know from geological studies,that these regions are the oldest regions on Mars.,In fact, the Earth and Mars,are both 4.6 billion years old.,The oldest rock on Earth is only 3.6 billion.,The reason there is a billion-year gap,in our geological understanding,is because of plate tectonics,,The crust of the Earth has been recycled.,We have no geological record prior,for the first billion years.,That record exists on Mars.,And this terrain that we're looking at,dates back to 4.6 billion years,when Earth and Mars were formed.,It was a Tuesday.,(Laughter) 
 This is a map that shows,where we've put our spacecraft on the surface of Mars.,Here is Viking I, Viking II.,This is Opportunity. This is Spirit.,This is Mars Pathfinder. This is Phoenix,,we just put two years ago.,Notice all of our rovers and all of our landers,have gone to the northern hemisphere.,That's because the northern hemisphere,is the region of the ancient,ocean basin.,There aren't many craters.,And that's because the water protected the basin,from being impacted by asteroids and meteorites.,But look in the southern hemisphere.,In the southern hemisphere there are impact craters,,there are volcanic craters.,Here's Hellas Basin,,a very very different place, geologically.,Look where the methane is, the methane is in a very,rough terrain area. 
 What is the best way to unravel,the mysteries on Mars that exist?,We asked this question 10 years ago.,We invited 10 of the top Mars scientists,to the Langley Research Center for two days.,We addressed on the board,the major questions that have not been answered.,And we spent two days deciding,how to best answer this question.,And the result of our meeting,was a robotic rocket-powered airplane we call ARES.,It's an Aerial Regional-scale Environmental Surveyor.,There's a model of ARES here.,This is a 20-percent scale model. 
 This airplane was designed at the Langley Research Center.,If any place in the world,can build an airplane to fly on Mars,,it's the Langley Research Center,,for almost 100 years,a leading center of aeronautics in the world.,We fly about a mile above the surface.,We cover hundreds of miles,,and we fly about 450 miles an hour.,We can do things that rovers can't do,and landers can't do:,We can fly above mountains, volcanoes, impact craters;,we fly over valleys;,we can fly over surface magnetism,,the polar caps, subsurface water;,and we can search for life on Mars. 
 But, of equal importance,,as we fly through the atmosphere of Mars,,we transmit that journey,,the first flight of an airplane outside of the Earth,,we transmit those images back to Earth.,And our goal is to inspire the American public,who is paying for this mission through tax dollars.,But more important we will,inspire the next generation of scientists,,technologists, engineers and mathematicians.,And that's a critical area of national security,and economic vitality, to make sure,we produce the next generation,of scientists, engineers, mathematicians and technologists. 
 This is what ARES looks like,as it flies over Mars.,We preprogram it.,We will fly where the methane is.,We will have instruments aboard the plane,that will sample, every three minutes, the atmosphere of Mars.,We will look for methane,as well as other gasses,produced by living systems.,We will pinpoint where these gases emanate from,,because we can measure the gradient where it comes from,,and there, we can direct the next mission,to land right in that area. 
 How do we transport an airplane to Mars?,In two words, very carefully.,The problem is we don't fly it to Mars,,we put it in a spacecraft,and we send it to Mars.,The problem is the spacecraft's,largest diameter is nine feet;,ARES is 21-foot wingspan, 17 feet long.,How do we get it to Mars?,We fold it,,and we transport it in a spacecraft.,And we have it in something called an aeroshell.,This is how we do it.,And we have a little video that describes the sequence. 
 Video: Seven, six. Green board. Five, four, three, two, one.,Main engine start, and liftoff. 
 Joel Levine: This is a launch from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.,This is the spacecraft taking nine months,to get to Mars.,It enters the atmosphere of Mars.,A lot of heating,,frictional heating. It's going 18 thousand miles an hour.,A parachute opens up to slow it down.,The thermal tiles fall off.,The airplane is exposed to the atmosphere for the first time.,It unfolds.,The rocket engine begins. 
 We believe that in a one-hour flight,we can rewrite the textbook on Mars,by making high-resolution measurements of the atmosphere,,looking for gases of biogenic origin,,looking for gases of volcanic origin,,studying the surface, studying the magnetism,on the surface, which we don't understand,,as well as about a dozen other areas. 
 Practice makes perfect.,How do we know we can do it?,Because we have tested ARES model,,several models in a half a dozen wind tunnels,at the NASA Langley Research Center for eight years,,under Mars conditions.,And, of equal importance,is, we test ARES in the Earth's atmosphere,,at 100,000 feet,,which is comparable to the density and pressure,of the atmosphere on Mars where we'll fly.,Now, 100,000 feet, if you fly cross-country to Los Angeles,,you fly 37,000 feet.,We do our tests at 100,000 feet. 
 And I want to show you one of our tests.,This is a half-scale model.,This is a high-altitude helium balloon.,This is over Tilamook, Oregon.,We put the folded airplane on the balloon --,it took about three hours to get up there --,and then we released it on command,at 103,000 feet,,and we deploy the airplane and everything works perfectly.,And we've done,high-altitude and low-altitude tests,,just to perfect this technique. 
 We're ready to go.,I have a scale model here.,But we have a full-scale model,in storage at the NASA Langley Research Center.,We're ready to go. All we need is a check from NASA headquarters,(Laughter),to cover the costs.,I'm prepared to donate my honorarium for today's talk,for this mission.,There's actually no honorarium for anyone for this thing.,This is the ARES team;,we have about 150 scientists, engineers;,where we're working with Jet Propulsion Laboratory,,Goddard Space Flight Center,,Ames Research Center and half a dozen major universities,and corporations in developing this. 
 It's a large effort. It's all at NASA Langley Research Center.,And let me conclude by saying,not too far from here,,right down the road in Kittyhawk, North Carolina,,a little more than 100 years ago,history was made,when we had the first powered flight of an airplane on Earth.,We are on the verge right now,to make the first flight of an airplane,outside the Earth's atmosphere.,We are prepared to fly this on Mars,,rewrite the textbook about Mars.,If you're interested in more information,,we have a website that describes this exciting,and intriguing mission, and why we want to do it.,Thank you very much.,(Applause)I want to talk about my investigations,into what technology means in our lives --,not just our immediate life,nbut in the cosmic sense,,in the kind of long history of the world,and our place in the world.,What is this stuff?,What is the significance?,And so, I want to kind ofngo through my little story,of what I found out. 
 One of the first thingsnI started to investigate,was the history of the name of technology.,In the United States,nthere is a State of the Union address,given by every president since 1790.,And each one of those is kind ofnsumming up the most important things,for the United States at that time.,If you search for the word "technology,"nit was not used until 1952.,So, technology was sort of absentnfrom everybody's thinking until 1952,,which happened to be the year of my birth.,And obviously, technologynhad existed before then,,but we weren't aware of it.,And so it was sort of an awakeningnof this force in our life. 
 I actually did research to find outnthe first use of the word "technology.",It was in 1829,,and it was invented by a guynwho was starting a curriculum --,a course, bringing together all the kindsnof arts and crafts, and industry --,and he called it "Technology.",And that's the very first use of the word. 
 So what is this stuff,that we're all consumed bynand bothered by?,Alan Kay calls it, "Technologynis anything that was invented,after you were born." 
 (Laughter) 
 Which is sort of the idea we normallynhave about what technology is:,it's all that new stuff.,It's not roads, or penicillin,,or factory tires; it's the new stuff.,My friend Danny Hillisnsays kind of a similar one,,he says, "Technology is anythingnthat doesn't work yet." 
 (Laughter) 
 Which is, again,na sense that it's all new. 
 But we know that it's just not new.,It actually goes way back,,and what I want to suggest is,nit goes a long way back.,So, another way to thinknabout technology, what it means,,is to imagine a world without technology.,If we were to eliminate every single bitnof technology in the world today --,and I mean everything,nfrom blades to scrapers to cloth --,we, as a species,nwould not live very long.,We would die by the billions,nand very quickly:,the wolves would get us,nwe would be defenseless,,we would be unable to grownenough food or find enough food. 
 Even the hunter-gatherersnused some elementary tools.,So, they had minimal technology,,but they had some technology.,And if we studynthose hunter-gatherer tribes,and the Neanderthal,nwhich are very similar to early man,,we find out a very curious thingnabout this world without technology,,and this is a kind of a curvenof their average age. 
 There are no Neanderthal fossilsnthat are older than 40 years old,that we've ever found,,and the average age of most of thesenhunter-gatherer tribes is 20 to 30.,There are very few young infants,nbecause they die -- high mortality rate --,and there's very few old people.,So the profile is sort of for your averagenSan Francisco neighborhood:,a lot of young people.,And if you go there, you say,n"Hey, everybody's really healthy.",Well, that's because they're all young. 
 Same thing with the hunter-gathererntribes and early man:,you didn't live beyond the age of 30.,So it was a world without grandparents.,And grandparents are very important,,because they are the transmitternof cultural evolution and information.,Imagine a world where basicallyneverybody was 20 to 30 years old.,How much learning can you do?,You can't do very muchnlearning in your own life,,it's so short,,and there's nobody to pass onnwhat you do learn.,So that's one aspect. 
 It was a very short life.,But at the same time, anthropologists know,that most hunter-gathererntribes of the world,,with that very little technology,,actually did not spend a very long timengathering the food they needed:,three to six hours a day.,Some anthropologists call thatnthe original affluent society,,because they hadnbankers' hours, basically.,So it was possible to get enough food.,But when the scarcity came,,when the highs and lowsnand the droughts came,,then people went into starvation.,And that's why they didn't live very long. 
 So what technology brought,,through the very simple toolsnlike these stone tools here --,even something as small as this --,the early bands of humans were actuallynable to eliminate to extinction,about 250 megafauna animalsnin North America,when they first arrived 10,000 years ago.,So, long before the industrial age,,we've been affectingnthe planet on a global scale,with just a small amount of technology. 
 The other thing that the early manninvented was fire.,And fire was used to clear out, and again,,affected the ecology of grassnand whole continents,,and was used in cooking.,It enabled us to actuallyneat all kinds of things.,It was, in a certain sense,nin a McLuhan sense,,an external stomach,,in the sense that it was cooking foodnthat we could not eat otherwise.,And if we didn't have fire,nwe actually could not live.,Our bodies have adaptednto these new diets.,Our bodies have changednin the last 10,000 years. 
 So, with that little bit of technology,,humans went from a small bandnof 10,000 or so --,the same numbernas Neanderthals everywhere --,and we suddenly exploded.,With the invention of languagenaround 50,000 years ago,,the number of humans exploded,,and very quickly becamenthe dominant species on the planet.,And they migratedninto the rest of the world,at two kilometers per year,until, within several tensnof thousands of years,,we occupied every singlenwatershed on the planet,and became the most dominant species,,with a very small amount of technology. 
 And even at that time,nwith the introduction of agriculture,,8,000, 10,000 years ago,,we started to see climate change.,So climate change is not a new thing;nwhat's new is just the degree of it.,Even during the agricultural age,nthere was climate change.,So already, small amounts of technologynwere transforming the world.,And what this means, and where I'm going,,is that technology has becomenthe most powerful force in the world.,All the things we see todaynthat are changing our lives,,we can always trace back,to the introductionnof some new technology. 
 So it's a force,,that is the most powerful forcenthat has been unleashed on this planet,,and in such a degree,,that I think it's become who we are.,In fact, our humanity and everythingnthat we think about ourselves,,is something we've invented.,So we've invented ourselves.,Of all the animalsnthat we've domesticated,,the most important animal has been us. 
 So humanity is our greatest invention,,but of course, we're not done yet.,We're still inventing,,and this is what technologynis allowing us to do;,it's continually to reinvent ourselves.,It's a very, very strong force.,I call this entire thing --nus humans as our technology,,everything that we've made,ngadgets in our lives --,we call that the technium.,That's this world.,My working definition of technology is:,anything useful that a human mind makes.,It's not just hammersnand gadgets, like laptops.,But it's also law.,And, of course, cities are waysnto make things more useful to us.,While this is somethingnthat comes from our mind,,it also has its rootsndeeply into the cosmos. 
 It goes back.,The origins and roots of technologyngo back to the Big Bang,,in this way, in that they are partnof this self-organizing thread,that starts at the Big Bangnand goes through galaxies and stars,,into life, into us.,And the three major phasesnof the early universe,was energy, when the dominantnforce was energy;,then the dominant force,nas it cooled, became matter;,and then, with the inventionnof life four billion years ago,,the dominant force in our neighborhoodnbecame information.,That's what life is:,an information processnthat was restructuring,and making new order. 
 So, energy and matter,nEinstein showed were equivalent,,and now new sciences of quantum computingnshow that entropy and information,and matter and energy,are all interrelated.,So it's one long continuum.,You put energyninto the right kind of system,,and out comes wasted heat, entropy,,and extropy, which is order.,It's the increased order. 
 Where does this order come from?,Its roots go way back.,We actually don't know.,But we do know,that the self-organization trendnthroughout the universe is long,,and it began with things like galaxies;,they maintained their ordernfor billions of years.,Stars are basicallynnuclear fission machines,that self-organize and self-sustainnthemselves for billions of years:,order against the extropy of the world.,And flowers and plantsnare the same thing, extended,,and technology is basicallynan extension of life. 
 One trend that we noticenin all those things,is that the amount of energynper gram per second,that flows through this,is actually increasing.,The amount of energy is increasingnthrough this little sequence.,And the amount of energy per gramnper second that flows through life,is actually greater than a star --,because of the star's long lifespan,,the energy density in lifenis actually higher than a star.,And the energy densitynthat we see in the greatest amount,anywhere in the universe,is actually in a PC chip.,There is more energy flowingnthrough, per gram per second,,than anything that we havenany other experience with. 
 And so, what I would suggest,is that if you want to seenwhere technology is going,,we continue that trajectory,,and we say, "Well, it's goingnto become more energy-dense,,that's where it's going.",And so what I've done is,nI've taken the same kinds of things,and looked at other aspectsnof evolutionary life and say,,"What are the general trendsnin evolutionary life?",And there are things movingntowards greater complexity,,moving towards greater diversity,nmoving towards greater specialization,,sentience, ubiquity,nand most important, evolvability.,Those very same thingsnare also present in technology.,That's where technology is going. 
 In fact, technologynis accelerating all the aspects of life.,And we can see that happening;,just as there's diversity in life,nthere's more diversity in things we make.,Things in life start offnbeing general cells,,and they become specialized:,you have tissue cells,nmuscle, brain cells.,The same thing happensnwith, say, a hammer,,which is general at firstnand becomes more specific.,So I would like to saynthat while there are six kingdoms of life,,we can think of technologynbasically as a seventh kingdom of life.,It's a branching off from the human form. 
 But technology has its own agenda,nlike anything, like life itself.,For instance, right now,nthree-quarters of the energy that we use,is actually used to feednthe technium itself.,In transportation, it's not to move us;,it's to move the stuff we make or buy.,I use the word "want." Technology wants.,This is a robot that wants to plugnitself in to get more power.,Your cat wants more food.,A bacterium, which hasnno consciousness at all,,wants to move towards light.,It has an urge,nand technology has an urge. 
 At the same time,nit wants to give us things,,and what it gives usnis basically progress.,You can take all kinds of curves,nand they're all pointing up.,There's really no dispute about progress,,if we discount the cost of that.,And that's the thingnthat bothers most people,,is that progress is really real,nbut we wonder and question:,What are the environmental costs of it? 
 I did a survey of the numbernof species of artifacts in my house,,and there's 6,000.,Other people have come up with 10,000.,When King Henry of England died,,he had 18,000 things in his house,,but that was the entirenwealth of England, so ... 
 (Laughter) 
 And with that entire wealth of England,,King Henry could not buy any antibiotics,,he could not buy refrigeration,,he could not buyna trip of a thousand miles,,whereas this rickshaw wallah in Indiancould save up and buy antibiotics,and he could buy refrigeration.,He could buy things that King Henry,nin all his wealth, could never buy.,That's what progress is about. 
 So, technology is selfish;ntechnology is generous.,That conflict, that tension,nwill be with us forever:,sometimes it wants to donwhat it wants to do,,and sometimes it's goingnto do things for us.,We have confusionnabout what we should think,about a new technology.,Right now the default positionnwhen a new technology comes along,,is people talk aboutnthe precautionary principle,,which is very common in Europe,,which says, basically, "Don't do anything.,When you meet a new technology, stop,,until it can be provennthat it does no harm.",I think that really leads nowhere. 
 But a better way isnwhat I call the proactionary principle,,which is, you engage with technology.,You try it out.,You obviously do what the precautionarynprinciple suggests,,you try to anticipate it,,but after anticipating it,,you constantly asses it,,not just once, but eternally.,And when it diverts from what you want,,we prioritize risk,nwe evaluate not just the new stuff,,but the old stuff.,We fix it; but most importantly,,we relocate it.,And what I mean by that is,,we find a new job for it. 
 Nuclear energy, fission,nis a really bad idea for bombs.,But it may be a pretty good ideanrelocated into sustainable nuclear energy,for electricity, instead of burning coal.,When we have a bad idea,,the response to a bad idea,is not no ideas,nit's not to stop thinking.,The response to a bad idea --,like, say, a tungsten lightbulb --,is a better idea.,So, better ideasnis really always the response,to technology we don't like;,it's basically better technology.,And actually, in a certain sense,ntechnology is a kind of a method,for generating better ideas,,if you can think about it that way. 
 So, maybe spraying DDTnon crops is a really bad idea.,But DDT sprayed on local homes --,there's nothing betternto eliminate malaria,,besides insect DDT-impregnatednmosquito nets.,But that's a really good idea;nthat's a good job for technology. 
 So our job as humansnis to parent our mind children,,to find them good friends,,to find them a good job.,And so, every technologynis sort of a creative force,looking for the right job.,That's actually my son, right here. 
 (Laughter) 
 There are no bad technologies,,just as there are no bad children.,We don't say children are neutral;nchildren are positive.,We just have to find them the right place. 
 And so, what technology gives usnover the long term --,over this sort of extended evolutionnfrom the beginning of time,,through the inventionnof the plants and animals,,and the evolution of life,nthe evolution of brains --,what that is constantly giving usnis increasing differences:,It's increasing diversity,nit's increasing options,,it's increasing choices, opportunities,npossibilities and freedoms.,That's what we getnfrom technology all the time.,That's why people leave villagesnand go into cities --,because they are always gravitatingntowards increased choices,and possibilities.,And we are aware of the price;,we pay a price for that,nbut we're aware of it,,and generally, we will pay the pricenfor increased freedoms,,choices and opportunities. 
 Even technology wants clean water.,Is technology diametricallynopposed to nature?,Because technologynis an extension of life,,it's in parallel and alignednwith the same things,that life wants.,So that I think technology loves biology,,if we allow it to.,Great movementnstarting billions of years ago,is moving through usnand it continues to go,,and our choice, so to speak,nin technology,,is really to align ourselvesnwith this force,much greater than ourselves. 
 So, technology is morenthan just the stuff in your pocket;,it's more than just gadgets,,it's more than just thingsnthat people invent.,It's actually part of a very longnstory -- a great story --,that began billions of years ago.,It's moving through us,nthis self-organization,,and we're extending and accelerating it,,and we can be part of it by aligningnthe technology that we make with it.,And I really appreciatenyour attention today. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I am going to speak about corruption,,but I would like to juxtapose,two different things.,One is the large global economy,,the large globalized economy,,and the other one is the small, and very limited,,capacity of our traditional governments,and their international institutions,to govern, to shape, this economy.,Because there is this asymmetry,,which creates, basically,,failing governance.,Failing governance in many areas:,in the area of corruption and the area of destruction of the environment,,in the area of exploitation of women and children,,in the area of climate change,,in all the areas in which we really need,a capacity to reintroduce,the primacy of politics,into the economy,,which is operating in a worldwide arena.,And I think corruption,,and the fight against corruption,,and the impact of corruption,,is probably one of the most interesting ways,to illustrate what I mean,with this failure of governance. 
 Let me talk about my own experience.,I used to work as the director,of the World Bank office in Nairobi,for East Africa.,At that time, I noticed,that corruption, that grand corruption,,that systematic corruption,,was undermining everything we were trying to do.,And therefore, I began,to not only try to protect,the work of the World Bank,,our own projects, our own programs,against corruption,,but in general, I thought, "We need a system,to protect the people,in this part of the world,from the ravages of corruption.",And as soon as I started this work,,I received a memorandum from the World Bank,,from the legal department first,,in which they said, "You are not allowed to do this.,You are meddling in the internal affairs of our partner countries.,This is forbidden by the charter of the World Bank,,so I want you to stop your doings." 
 In the meantime, I was chairing,donor meetings, for instance,,in which the various donors,,and many of them like to be in Nairobi --,it is true, it is one of the,unsafest cities of the world,,but they like to be there because the other cities,are even less comfortable.,And in these donor meetings, I noticed,that many of the worst projects --,which were put forward,by our clients, by the governments,,by promoters,,many of them representing,suppliers from the North --,that the worst projects,were realized first.,Let me give you an example:,a huge power project,,300 million dollars,,to be built smack into,one of the most vulnerable, and one of the most beautiful,,areas of western Kenya.,And we all noticed immediately,that this project had no economic benefits:,It had no clients, nobody would buy the electricity there,,nobody was interested in irrigation projects.,To the contrary, we knew that this project,would destroy the environment:,It would destroy riparian forests,,which were the basis for,the survival of nomadic groups,,the Samburu and the Turkana in this area.,So everybody knew this is a, not a useless project,,this is an absolute damaging, a terrible project --,not to speak about the future indebtedness of the country,for these hundreds of millions of dollars,,and the siphoning off,of the scarce resources of the economy,from much more important activities,like schools, like hospitals and so on.,And yet, we all rejected this project,,none of the donors was willing,to have their name connected with it,,and it was the first project to be implemented. 
 The good projects, which we as a donor community,would take under our wings,,they took years, you know,,you had too many studies,,and very often they didn't succeed.,But these bad projects,,which were absolutely damaging -- for the economy,for many generations, for the environment,,for thousands of families who had to be resettled --,they were suddenly put together,by consortia of banks,,of supplier agencies,,of insurance agencies --,like in Germany, Hermes, and so on --,and they came back very, very quickly,,driven by an unholy alliance,between the powerful elites,in the countries there,and the suppliers from the North.,Now, these suppliers,were our big companies.,They were the actors of this global market,,which I mentioned in the beginning.,They were the Siemenses of this world,,coming from France, from the UK, from Japan,,from Canada, from Germany,,and they were systematically driven,by systematic, large-scale corruption.,We are not talking about,50,000 dollars here,,or 100,000 dollars there, or one million dollars there.,No, we are talking about 10 million, 20 million dollars,on the Swiss bank accounts,,on the bank accounts of Liechtenstein,,of the president's ministers,,the high officials in the para-statal sectors. 
 This was the reality which I saw,,and not only one project like that:,I saw, I would say,,over the years I worked in Africa,,I saw hundreds of projects like this.,And so, I became convinced,that it is this systematic corruption,which is perverting economic policy-making in these countries,,which is the main reason,for the misery, for the poverty,,for the conflicts, for the violence,,for the desperation,in many of these countries.,That we have today,more than a billion people below the absolute poverty line,,that we have more than a billion people,without proper drinking water in the world,,twice that number,,more than two billion people,without sanitation and so on,,and the consequent illnesses,of mothers and children,,still, child mortality of more than,10 million people every year,,children dying before they are five years old:,The cause of this is, to a large extent,,grand corruption. 
 Now, why did the World Bank,not let me do this work?,I found out afterwards,,after I left, under a big fight, the World Bank.,The reason was that the members of the World Bank,thought that foreign bribery was okay,,including Germany.,In Germany, foreign bribery was allowed.,It was even tax-deductible.,No wonder that most of the most important,international operators in Germany,,but also in France and the UK,and Scandinavia, everywhere, systematically bribed.,Not all of them, but most of them.,And this is the phenomenon,which I call failing governance,,because when I then came to Germany,and started this little NGO,here in Berlin, at the Villa Borsig,,we were told, "You cannot stop,our German exporters from bribing,,because we will lose our contracts.,We will lose to the French,,we will lose to the Swedes, we'll lose to the Japanese.",And therefore, there was a indeed a prisoner's dilemma,,which made it very difficult,for an individual company,,an individual exporting country,to say, "We are not going to,continue this deadly, disastrous,habit of large companies to bribe." 
 So this is what I mean,with a failing governance structure,,because even the powerful government,,which we have in Germany, comparatively,,was not able to say,,"We will not allow our companies to bribe abroad.",They needed help,,and the large companies themselves,have this dilemma.,Many of them didn't want to bribe.,Many of the German companies, for instance,,believe that they are really,producing a high-quality product,at a good price, so they are very competitive.,They are not as good at bribing,as many of their international competitors are,,but they were not allowed,to show their strengths,,because the world was eaten up,by grand corruption. 
 And this is why I'm telling you this:,Civil society rose to the occasion.,We had this small NGO,,Transparency International.,They began to think of,an escape route from this prisoner's dilemma,,and we developed concepts,of collective action,,basically trying to bring various competitors,together around the table,,explaining to all of them,how much it would be in their interests,if they simultaneously would stop bribing,,and to make a long story short,,we managed to eventually,get Germany to sign,together with the other OECD countries,and a few other exporters. 
 In 1997, a convention,,under the auspices of the OECD,,which obliged everybody,to change their laws,and criminalize foreign bribery.,(Applause),Well, thank you. I mean, it's interesting,,in doing this,,we had to sit together with the companies.,We had here in Berlin, at the Aspen Institute on the Wannsee,,we had sessions with about,20 captains of industry,,and we discussed with them,what to do about international bribery.,In the first session -- we had three sessions,over the course of two years.,And President von Weizsäcker, by the way,,chaired one of the sessions, the first one,,to take the fear away,from the entrepreneurs,,who were not used to deal,with non-governmental organizations.,And in the first session, they all said,,"This is not bribery, what we are doing." This is customary there.,This is what these other cultures demand.,They even applaud it.,In fact, [unclear],still says this today.,And so there are still a lot of people,who are not convinced that you have to stop bribing.,But in the second session,,they admitted already that they would never do this,,what they are doing in these other countries,,here in Germany, or in the U.K., and so on.,Cabinet ministers would admit this.,And in the final session, at the Aspen Institute,,we had them all sign an open letter,to the Kohl government, at the time,,requesting that they,participate in the OECD convention. 
 And this is, in my opinion,,an example of soft power,,because we were able to convince them,that they had to go with us.,We had a longer-term time perspective.,We had a broader,,geographically much wider,,constituency we were trying to defend.,And that's why the law has changed.,That's why Siemens is now in the trouble they are in,and that's why MIN is in the trouble they are in.,In some other countries, the OECD convention,is not yet properly enforced.,And, again, civil societies,breathing down the neck of the establishment. 
 In London, for instance,,where the BAE got away,with a huge corruption case,,which the Serious Fraud Office tried to prosecute,,100 million British pounds,,every year for ten years,,to one particular official of one particular friendly country,,who then bought for,44 billion pounds of military equipment.,This case, they are not prosecuting in the UK.,Why? Because they consider this,as contrary to the security interest,of the people of Great Britain.,Civil society is pushing, civil society,is trying to get a solution to this problem,,also in the U.K.,,and also in Japan, which is not properly enforcing,,and so on. 
 In Germany, we are pushing,the ratification of the UN convention,,which is a subsequent convention.,We are, Germany, is not ratifying.,Why? Because it would make it necessary,to criminalize the corruption,of deputies.,In Germany, we have a system where,you are not allowed to bribe a civil servant,,but you are allowed to bribe a deputy.,This is, under German law, allowed,,and the members of our parliament don't want to change this,,and this is why they can't sign,the U.N. convention against foreign bribery --,one of they very, very few countries,which is preaching honesty and good governance everywhere in the world,,but not able to ratify the convention,,which we managed to get on the books,with about 160 countries all over the world. 
 I see my time is ticking.,Let me just try to,draw some conclusions from what has happened.,I believe that what we managed to achieve,in fighting corruption,,one can also achieve,in other areas of failing governance.,By now, the United Nations,is totally on our side.,The World Bank has turned from Saulus to Paulus; under Wolfensohn,,they became, I would say, the strongest,anti-corruption agency in the world.,Most of the large companies,are now totally convinced,that they have to put in place,very strong policies,against bribery and so on.,And this is possible because civil society,joined the companies,and joined the government,in the analysis of the problem,,in the development of remedies,,in the implementation of reforms,,and then later, in the monitoring of reforms. 
 Of course, if civil society organizations,want to play that role,,they have to grow into this responsibility.,Not all civil society organizations are good.,The Ku Klux Klan is an NGO.,So, we must be aware,that civil society,has to shape up itself.,They have to have a much more,transparent financial governance.,They have to have a much more participatory governance,in many civil society organizations.,We also need much more competence of civil society leaders.,This is why we have set up the governance school,and the Center for Civil Society here in Berlin,,because we believe most of our educational,and research institutions in Germany,and continental Europe in general,,do not focus enough, yet,,on empowering civil society,and training the leadership of civil society. 
 But what I'm saying from my very practical experience:,If civil society does it right,and joins the other actors --,in particular, governments,,governments and their international institutions,,but also large international actors,,in particular those which have committed themselves,to corporate social responsibility --,then in this magical triangle,between civil society,,government and private sector,,there is a tremendous chance,for all of us to create a better world. 
 Thank you.
