Five years ago, I had my dream job.,I was a foreign correspondentnin the Middle East,reporting for ABC News.,But there was a crack in the wall,,a problem with our industry,,that I felt we needed to fix.,You see, I got to the Middle Eastnright around the end of 2007,,which was just around the midpoint,of the Iraq War.,But by the time I got there,nit was already nearly impossible,to find stories about Iraq on air.,Coverage had dropped across the board,,across networks.,And of the stories that did make it,,more than 80 percentnof them were about us.,We were missing the stories about Iraq,,the people who live there,,and what was happening to themnunder the weight of the war. 
 Afghanistan had alreadynfallen off the agenda.,There were less than one percentnof all news stories in 2008,that went to the war in Afghanistan.,It was the longest war in US history,,but information was so scarce,that schoolteachers we spoke to,told us they had troublenexplaining to their students,what we were doing there,,when those students had parents,who were fightingnand sometimes dying overseas. 
 We had drawn a blank,,and it wasn't just Iraq and Afghanistan.,From conflict zones to climate change,to all sorts of issuesnaround crises in public health,,we were missing what I callnthe species-level issues,,because as a species,nthey could actually sink us.,And by failing to understandnthe complex issues of our time,,we were facing certainnpractical implications.,How were we going to solve problems,that we didn't fundamentally understand,,that we couldn't track in real time,,and where the people working on the issues,were invisible to us,and sometimes invisible to each other? 
 When you look back on Iraq,,those years when wenwere missing the story,,were the years when the societynwas falling apart,,when we were setting the conditionsnfor what would become the rise of ISIS,,the ISIS takeover of Mosul,and terrorist violence that would spread,beyond Iraq's bordersnto the rest of the world. 
 Just around that timenwhere I was making that observation,,I looked across the border of Iraq,and noticed there was anothernstory we were missing:,the war in Syria.,If you were a Middle-East specialist,nyou knew that Syria was that important,from the start.,But it ended up being, really,,one of the forgotten storiesnof the Arab Spring.,I saw the implications up front.,Syria is intimately tiednto regional security,,to global stability.,I felt like we couldn't let that become,another one of the stories we left behind. 
 So I left my big TV job to startna website, called "Syria Deeply.",It was designed to be a newsnand information source,that made it easier to understandna complex issue,,and for the past four years,nit's been a resource,for policymakers and professionalsnworking on the conflict in Syria.,We built a business model,based on consistent,nhigh-quality information,,and convening the top minds on the issue.,And we found it was a model that scaled.,We got passionate requestsnto do other things "Deeply.",So we started to work our wayndown the list. 
 I'm just one of many entrepreneurs,,and we are just one of many start-ups,trying to fix what's wrong with news.,All of us in the trenches know,that something is wrongnwith the news industry.,It's broken.,Trust in the medianhas hit an all-time low.,And the statistic you're seeing up therenis from September --,it's arguably gotten worse.,But we can fix this.,We can fix the news.,I know that that's true.,You can call me an idealist;nI call myself an industrious optimist.,And I know there arena lot of us out there.,We have ideas for hownto make things better,,and I want to share three of themnthat we've picked up in our own work. 
 Idea number one:,we need news that's builtnon deep-domain knowledge.,Given the waves and waves of layoffsnat newsrooms across the country,,we've lost the art of specialization.,Beat reporting is an endangered thing.,When it comes to foreign news,,the way we can fix thatnis by working with more local journalists,,treating them like our partnersnand collaborators,,not just fixers who fetch usnphone numbers and sound bites.,Our local reporters in Syrianand across Africa and across Asia,bring us stories that we certainlynwould not have found on our own.,Like this one from the suburbsnof Damascus, about a wheelchair race,that gave hopento those wounded in the war.,Or this one from Sierra Leone,,about a local chiefnwho curbed the spread of Ebola,by self-organizingna quarantine in his district.,Or this one from the border of Pakistan,,about Afghan refugees being forcednto return home before they are ready,,under the threat of police intimidation.,Our local journalists are our mentors.,They teach us something new every day,,and they bring us storiesnthat are important for all of us to know. 
 Idea number two:,we need a kind of Hippocratic oathnfor the news industry,,a pledge to first do no harm. 
 (Applause) 
 Journalists need to be tough.,We need to speak truth to power,,but we also need to be responsible.,We need to live up to our own ideals,,and we need to recognize,when what we're doingncould potentially harm society,,where we lose track of journalismnas a public service. 
 I watched us cover the Ebola crisis.,We launched Ebola Deeply. We did our best.,But what we saw was a public,that was flooded with hystericalnand sensational coverage,,sometimes inaccurate,nsometimes completely wrong.,Public health experts tell menthat that actually cost us in human lives,,because by sparking more panicnand by sometimes getting the facts wrong,,we made it harder for people to resolve,what was actually happening on the ground.,All that noise made it hardernto make the right decisions. 
 We can do better as an industry,,but it requires us recognizingnhow we got it wrong last time,,and deciding not to go that way next time.,It's a choice.,We have to resist the temptationnto use fear for ratings.,And that decision has to be madenin the individual newsroom,and with the individual news executive.,Because the next deadly virusnthat comes around,could be much worsenand the consequences much higher,,if we do what we did last time;,if our reporting isn't responsiblenand it isn't right. 
 The third idea?,We need to embrace complexity,if we want to make sensenof a complex world.,Embrace complexity -- 
 (Applause) 
 not treat the world simplistically,nbecause simple isn't accurate.,We live in a complex world.,News is adult education.,It's our job as journalistsnto get elbow deep in complexity,and to find new ways to make it easiernfor everyone else to understand.,If we don't do that,,if we pretend there arenjust simple answers,,we're leading everyone off a steep cliff.,Understanding complexitynis the only way to know the real threats,that are around the corner.,It's our responsibilitynto translate those threats,and to help you understand what's real,,so you can be prepared and knownwhat it takes to be ready,for what comes next. 
 I am an industrious optimist.,I do believe we can fix what's broken.,We all want to.,There are great journalistsnout there doing great work --,we just need new formats.,I honestly believenthis is a time of reawakening,,reimagining what we can do.,I believe we can fix what's broken.,I know we can fix the news.,I know it's worth trying,,and I truly believe that in the end,,we're going to get this right. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Joseph Keller used to jognaround the Stanford campus,,and he was struck by all the womennjogging there as well.,Why did their ponytails swingnfrom side to side like that?,Being a mathematician,nhe set out to understand why. 
 (Laughter) 
 Professor Keller was curiousnabout many things:,why teapots dribble,or how earthworms wriggle.,Until a few months ago,nI hadn't heard of Joseph Keller.,I read about him in the New York Times,,in the obituaries.,The Times had half a pagenof editorial dedicated to him,,which you can imagine is premium spacenfor a newspaper of their stature. 
 I read the obituaries almost every day.,My wife understandably thinksnI'm rather morbid,to begin my day with scrambled eggsnand a "Let's see who died today." 
 (Laughter) 
 But if you think about it,,the front page of the newspapernis usually bad news,,and cues man's failures.,An instance where bad newsncues accomplishment,is at the end of the paper,nin the obituaries. 
 In my day job,,I run a company that focusesnon future insights,that marketers can derivenfrom past data --,a kind of rearview-mirror analysis.,And we began to think:,What if we held a rearview mirrornto obituaries from the New York Times?,Were there lessons on how you could getnyour obituary featured --,even if you aren't around to enjoy it? 
 (Laughter) 
 Would this go better with scrambled eggs? 
 (Laughter) 
 And so, we looked at the data.,2,000 editorial, non-paid obituaries,over a 20-month periodnbetween 2015 and 2016.,What did these 2,000 deaths --nrather, lives -- teach us? 
 Well, first we looked at words.,This here is an obituary headline.,This one is of the amazing Lee Kuan Yew.,If you remove the beginning and the end,,you're left with a beautifullynworded descriptor,that tries to, in just a few words,ncapture an achievement or a lifetime.,Just looking at these is fascinating.,Here are a few famous ones,npeople who died in the last two years.,Try and guess who they are. 
 [An Artist who Defied Genre],That's Prince. 
 [Titan of Boxing and the 20th Century],Oh, yes. 
 [Muhammad Ali] 
 [Groundbreaking Architect],Zaha Hadid. 
 So we took these descriptors,and did what's callednnatural language processing,,where you feed these into a program,,it throws out the superfluous words --,"the," "and," -- the kind of wordsnyou can mime easily in "Charades," --,and leaves you with the mostnsignificant words.,And we did it not just for these four,,but for all 2,000 descriptors.,And this is what it looks like.,Film, theatre, music, dancenand of course, art, are huge.,Over 40 percent.,You have to wondernwhy in so many societies,we insist that our kids pursuenengineering or medicine or business or law,to be construed as successful.,And while we're talking profession,,let's look at age --,the average age at whichnthey achieved things.,That number is 37.,What that means is,nyou've got to wait 37 years ...,before your first significant achievementnthat you're remembered for --,on average --,44 years later, when youndie at the age of 81 --,on average. 
 (Laughter) 
 Talk about having to be patient. 
 (Laughter) 
 Of course, it varies by profession.,If you're a sports star,,you'll probably hitnyour stride in your 20s.,And if you're in your 40s like me,,you can join the fun world of politics. 
 (Laughter) 
 Politicians do their first and sometimesnonly commendable act in their mid-40s. 
 (Laughter) 
 If you're wondering what "others" are,,here are some examples.,Isn't it fascinating, the things people do,and the things they're remembered for? 
 (Laughter) 
 Our curiosity was in overdrive,,and we desired to analyzenmore than just a descriptor.,So, we ingested the entirenfirst paragraph of all 2,000 obituaries,,but we did this separatelynfor two groups of people:,people that are famousnand people that are not famous.,Famous people -- Prince,nAli, Zaha Hadid --,people who are not famousnare people like Jocelyn Cooper,,Reverend Curry,or Lorna Kelly.,I'm willing to bet you haven't heardnof most of their names.,Amazing people, fantastic achievements,nbut they're not famous.,So what if we analyzenthese two groups separately --,the famous and the non-famous?,What might that tell us? 
 Take a look.,Two things leap out at me.,First:,"John." 
 (Laughter) 
 Anyone here named Johnnshould thank your parents -- 
 (Laughter) 
 and remind your kids to cut outnyour obituary when you're gone.,And second:,"help." 
 We uncovered, many lessonsnfrom lives well-led,,and what those people immortalizednin print could teach us.,The exercise was a fascinating testamentnto the kaleidoscope that is life,,and even more fascinating,was the fact that the overwhelmingnmajority of obituaries,featured people famous and non-famous,,who did seemingly extraordinary things.,They made a positive dentnin the fabric of life.,They helped. 
 So ask yourselves as you gonback to your daily lives:,How am I using my talents to help society?,Because the most powerful lesson here is,,if more people lived their livesntrying to be famous in death,,the world would be a much better place. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Last year, I got a chance to watchnthe new "Star Wars" movie,,which was fantastic,,but one thing kept bugging me.,I don't know if you noticed this or not.,In this entirely technicallynadvanced world,,I did not see a single AED anywhere,,which was totally shocking --,almost as shockingnas not knowing what an AED is,,which you guys do know.,But for those at home,,an AED is an automatednexternal defibrillator.,It's the device you usenwhen your heart goes into cardiac arrest,to shock it back into a normal rhythm,,or, as one of the guys I was teachingna class to referred to it as:,"The shocky-hearty-box thing." 
 (Laughter) 
 But I really can't blame the Empire,,since health and safety regulations,aren't really their firstnorder of business.,Though, even if we --,I think worse than not having an AEDnwould be if there was one there,,but just, no one knew where to find it.,These devices can drastically increasenyour chance of survival --,almost like a tauntaun on Hoth. 
 (Laughter) 
 But I'm pretty surenthat stormtrooper is going to be toast,,regardless if we have an AED or not,,since what happens is the chest platenis going to be quite hard to get off,,and like that tauntaun,,the AED has a very short window of timenat which it's highly effective.,In this case -- basically, we've gotnto use it within the first 10 minutes. 
 The Jedi, on the other hand,nhave no problems with their outfits.,Those robes open straight up,,you can place the padsnright onto the chest --,so upper-right-hand side of the chest,,lower left,,wait for the unit to determinenif it's a shockable rhythm,and get ready to shock.,But, the Jedi do have a problem.,They have a head appendage issue.,And so I can be totally clear,nthinking I'm ready to go,,but I'm accidentally touching a tentacle,and inadvertently shocking myself. 
 (Laughter) 
 So before you hit that button,nmake sure you are clear,and everyone else is clear. 
 Going back to that stormtrooper:,If I did get that chest plate off in time,,what would you do if you suddenly foundnthere was a Wookiee under there,,or possibly two Ewoks? 
 (Laughter) 
 Well, lucky for us,,in the kit there's actually a razor,,and we can use that to shave the chestnon the upper right-hand side,and the lower left. 
 Wookiees also have another problem.,They have an accessory issue.,What we want to do is remove these --,anything between the two padsnwe want to remove,,since it can causensomething called "arcing.",For those who don't know what arcing is,,do you remember the Emperor,,when he shoots electricitynout the ends of his fingers -- 
 (Laughter) 
 that would be kind of like arcing.,Another thing that --,Oh! By the way, he creates thatnby wearing wool socks under his robes. 
 (Laughter) 
 We can also get arcing if we havenan extremely wet chest.,The electricity travels across the surfaceninstead of through the heart.,We can correct this with the immortalnwords of Douglas Adams:,"Don't panic," which most of usnhave done today --,and also always having a towel.,So, good words to go by. 
 The metal bikini -- unfortunately,nthis is where panic sets in --,like the modern bra,,we have to make sure we remove,,because this can causensevere arcing along with burns.,But unfortunately this opens up an issue,that's almost as controversialnas talking about the prequels. 
 (Laughter) 
 The mere mention of the word "nipples,",and people get into a littlenbit of a tizzy.,By the way, that is not a nipple,nthat's a cupcake. 
 (Laughter) 
 Chances are, if you do have to use this,,this is going to be on someone you know.,And remember, everyone has nipples,,except for Jabba. 
 (Laughter) 
 But he does love cupcakes.,Speaking about Jabba,,if we do have to use an AED on him,,remember pad placement is the same,,even though he doesn't have nipples.,So it's going to benupper right-hand side, lower left.,If we were going through, we're shocking,ngetting ready to go --,after we've done the shock,,one of the things we need to donis remember to do compression.,The preferred methodnis 30 compressions and two breaths,in the center of the chest,nbetween the nipples,,pressing down at least two inches,,no more than two and a half,,at a rate of at least 100 beats a minute,,no more than 120.,Unfortunately, due to the sizenof Jabba's mouth,and also what he puts in said mouth,,we may not want to actuallyndo the mouth-to-mouth part.,So instead, we can doncompression-only CPR.,The way of rememberingnthe compression-only part,is we can actually use the Imperial March. 
 I would sing it for you -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Unfortunately, that would be morensomething an interrogation droid would do. 
 Yoda.,Small little guy, like a baby.,What we do is basicallyntreat him like a baby,,in the sense that we're going to placenone pad in the center of the chest,and one in the back.,If we place them both in the front,,they can be too closenand cause severe arcing,,so we want to avoid that. 
 Hopefully, this helped to clarify,and put some lightnon some of the darker issues,of using an AED in the Star Wars universe,,or any universe in total. 
 I'll leave you with one point.,Remember, if you do find yourselfndealing with a Wookiee,,do not shave the entire Wookiee.,This takes way too much time,,and it only pisses them off. 
 (Laughter) 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I have a confession.,I have been in an affair,since I was 17 years old.,I wish I could talk aboutnbutterflies in my stomach,or maps I drew on the ground,when I think about this affair,,but I cannot.,I wish I could talk aboutnsweet words spoken,or gifts that I received,from this affair,,but I cannot.,All I can tell you about is the aftermath,,about days I spent constantly asking:,Why, why, why me? 
 I remember how it all began.,I was in my final year of high school,,and my class had just won in sports,,so we were singing and dancingnand hugging each other.,I went and took a shower.,Then I went for dinner.,And when I sat down to eat,,my teeth started chattering,,and so I couldn't putnthe spoon in my mouth.,I rushed to the nurse's office,,and because I couldn't talk,nI just pointed at my mouth.,She didn't know what was happening,,so she told me to lie down,,and it worked --,after a few minutes,nthe chattering stopped.,I was about to dash out,nand she told me --,no, she insisted -- that I go upnto the dormitories to sleep.,Here I was in my final yearnof high school,,just a few months from doingnmy end of high school exams,and a few days from doing a setnof exams we call here in Kenya "mocks,",which are somehow meant to gaugenhow prepared one is for the final exams.,There is no way I was going to sleep,and let a set of exams mock me. 
 I went to class, sat down,,took my Kenyan history notes,,and there I was, down Kenyan coastal town,,with the great Mekatilili wa Menza,,the Giriama woman who led her peoplenagainst British colonial rule.,Then, without any notice,,my left hand started jerking,,and it was as if I was markingnimaginary papers.,In and out it went,,and with every stroke, one by one,,my classmates stoppednconcentrating on their reading,and started looking at me.,And I tried really hard to stop it,,but I couldn't,,because it had a life of its own.,And then, when it was sureneverybody was looking at us,,in its final shownand official introduction,,I had my first full-blown seizure,,which was the beginning of whatnhas been a 15-year-long affair. 
 Seizures are the trademark characteristicnfor most types of epilepsy,,and every first-ever seizurenneeds to be assessed by a doctor,to determine if one has epilepsy,or if it's a symptom of something else.,In my case, it was confirmednthat I had epilepsy.,I spent a large chunk of my timenin hospital and at home,,and only went back to do my final exams.,I had seizures in between papers,,but managed to get good enough grades,to be admitted for an actuarialnscience degree,at the University of Nairobi. 
 (Applause) 
 Unfortunately, I had to drop outnin my second year.,I didn't have good enough coping skills,and a support community around me.,I was lucky enough to get a job,,but I was fired from that jobnwhen I had a seizure in the workplace. 
 So I found myself in a space,where I was constantly asking myself,why this had to happen to me.,I lived in denial for a long time,,and the denial was maybe becausenof the things that had happened,,dropping out of schoolnand being fired from my job.,Or maybe it was because of the thingsnI had heard about epilepsy,and about people living with epilepsy:,that they would never live on their own;,that they would never travel on their own,or even get work;,that they were outcasts,,with a spirit in them that they needednto be delivered from. 
 And so the more I thoughtnabout these things,,the more my seizures became,,and I spent days with my legs locked,,my speech became blurred,and on days on end, this is how I'd be.,Two or three days after a seizure,,my head and my handnwould still be twitching.,I felt lost,,like I'd lost everything,,and sometimes,,even the will to live. 
 (Sigh) 
 I had so much frustration in me.,And so I started writing,,because the people around mendidn't have answers,to the questions that I had.,And so I wrote my fears,and my doubts.,I wrote about my good daysnand my bad days and my really ugly days,,and I shared them on a blog.,And before long,,I began to be seen and heardnby people who had epilepsy,and their families,,and even those who did notnhave the diagnosis.,And I moved from that girlnwho constantly asked why me,to one who not only self-advocates,,but does it for those who are yetnto find their voices. 
 (Applause) 
 My seizures are greatly reduced,nfrom two to three times a day,,to sometimes two to threentimes in one year. 
 I went on -- 
 (Applause) 
 I went on to employ five people,,when I began what was Kenya's first,free mental healthnand epilepsy support line. 
 And I travel -- 
 (Applause) 
 And I travel to speak about my affair,,all these things that I had been told,people like me living with epilepsyncould never be able to do. 
 Every year, a populationnas big as 80 percent of Nairobi,gets diagnosed with epilepsy,across the globe.,And they, like me,,go through the emotionsnof stigma and exclusion.,And so I have made it my life journey,to keep these conversations going,,and I keep confessing about my affair,so that those people who do notnhave the diagnosis,might know and might havena constant reminder,that it is alright to engagenwith people like us,,that as long as they pull downnthe walls of stigma and exclusion,,that we, just like them,,can be able to take anythingnlife throws at us. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So, raise your handnif you've seen somebody in your city,standing on a corner,nholding a sign like this.,I think we all have.,If you're being honest,,at least one time,nhave you wondered if they mean it?,If we offered them a job,nwould they really take it?,And what would that job meannto them in their lives?,Well, this is a storynabout what happened in my city,when we decided to find out,,when we decided to think differentlynabout panhandling,,and lift people upnthrough the dignity of work. 
 We call it, "There's a Better Way.",We call it There's a Better Way,because I believe there's a better waynto get the money you need,than panhandling on the corner.,I believe there's a better waynto help your brothers and sisters in need,than handing a few dollarsnout the car window.,We know there's dignity in work.,We also know that people are much morenlikely to invest in themselves,if they believe that their communitynis willing to invest in them first.,And because we're all wirednto be kind and compassionate,,it always feels good to handna couple of dollars to someone,that is in need.,But if you talk to panhandlers,nmany of them will tell you,that your few dollars don't necessarilyngo towards feeding the body,,they go towards feeding an addiction.,There's a better way. 
 My name is Richard Berry,,and I have one of the bestnjobs in the world.,I get to be the mayornof a great American city,,Albuquerque, New Mexico.,I was at lunch on July 17, 2015,nin my great American city,,and on my way back to city hall,,I saw this gentleman standing on a corner.,As you can see, he's holding a sign,,and his sign says he wants a job.,But if you look closer at the picture,,you'll see he's standingnunderneath a blue sign,,and that sign says, if you need help,nif you need food or shelter,or you'd like to donate,,please call 311,nour community service number. 
 So why is this guy standingnunderneath my sign with his sign?,Well, we wonderednif anybody would call that 311 sign,,and as it turns out, they did --,11,000 times people called.,I put those up in about 30 intersections.,And we did connect themnwith food and shelter and services.,But yet he's still standing under my sign,with a sign that says he wants a job.,It's simple: he wants a job.,So I decided to donsomething rare in government.,I decided to make the solution simplernrather than more complicated.,I went back to my office,nI gathered my staff around,and I said, "We're goingnto take this man at his word,,and others like him.,The man says he wants a job,nwe're going to give him a job,,and we're going to make our citynan even better place in the meantime." 
 You see, Albuquerque is a beautiful place.,We're a mile high,,the Sandia Mountains on the east,,the Rio Grande runs throughnthe center of the city;,we're the home of the AlbuquerquenInternational Balloon Fiesta.,On a day like today,,you could literally ski this morningnand golf this afternoon.,But there's always something to do --,always weeds to pull, litter to pick up.,If you're going to have an initiativenlike this in your city,,you have to ask yourself two questions.,First one is: Is there anythingnleft to do in your city?,And if the answer is no,,would you please give menyour mayor's phone number,,because I need some advice. 
 (Laughter) 
 But the second questionnyou have to ask is this:,Are your solutions to panhandling working?,If you're like Albuquerque,,and you're taking the punitivenapproach like we used to,,handing out tickets to panhandlersnor those who give them money,,I'm going to suggestnthat your solutions aren't working,,and I know you're not gettingnto the root of your problem in your city.,So if you have something to do,and you need peoplenthat need something to do,,there's a better way.,And the good news is,nit's not that complicated. 
 This a 2006 Dodge van.,It was in my motor poolnnot doing anything.,We put some new tires on it,nwrapped it with a logo.,This van now goes out to street cornersnwhere our panhandlers are --,we go to them.,We stop the van, we get out,,we ask them if theynwould like a day's work,rather than panhandling for the day.,And if you wonderednif they really mean it --,it takes us about an hournto fill this van up in the morning,,because almost everybody we askntakes a job for the day. 
 But you need more than just a van.,You need a super-fantasticnhuman being to drive that van.,And my super-fantastic human being,nhis name is Will.,This is him in the yellow vest.,Will works at our local nonprofit partner.,He works with the homeless every day.,The panhandlers trust him,,he believes in them,,he hustles.,I like to say, "Wherenthere's a Will, there's a way.",So if you're going to donthe Better Way campaign in your city,,you need to find yourself a Will,,because he's really one of the keysnto making this successful,in the city of Albuquerque. 
 You also need a great nonprofit partner.,Ours is St. Martin's Hospitality Center.,They've been in our communitynfor over 30 years.,They provide counseling, food, shelter,,and if they don't provide it,,they know somebody in our city that does.,But they do something much morenfor me as the mayor.,They provide agility.,You see, it takes me two weeks,,maybe two months sometimes,,to onboard an employeenwith the city of Albuquerque.,So you could imagine --,my old Dodge van,,my super-fantastic human being, Will,,a great local nonprofit partner --,they drive to the corner,nthere's a panhandler,,they say, "Would you likento work for the day?",The panhandler says, "Yes,",and Will says, "Great! I'll be backnin six weeks to pick you up." 
 (Laughter) 
 It wouldn't work.,It's really important that we haventhat agility in our program.,And they do the paperwork,,they do the insurance,,they do all of the other formsnthat I can't do quickly. 
 We pay our panhandlersnnine dollars an hour.,We feed them once at the jobsite.,At the end of the day,,our old Dodge van takes themnright back to St. Martin's,,and they get connectednwith counseling services. 
 So far,,with the pilot programnand a couple days a week,,and a fantastic human beingnand a Dodge van,,we've cleaned up 400 city blocksnin the city of Albuquerque.,We've picked up over 117,000 poundsnof trash, weeds and litter.,I don't know if you've evernweighed a tumbleweed,,but they don't weigh much,,so you can imagine the volumenof material that we've picked up. 
 My city has 6,000 employees,,and none betternthan my solid waste department.,We send our trucks outnat the end of the day,,they help the panhandlersnput into the truck,the material they've picked upnduring the day,,and we take it to the landfill.,I'm lucky that I have city employees,that are willing to work side by sidenwith our panhandlers.,They're lifting up our citynwhile lifting up their lives.,And like anything else --nlisten, it takes resources.,But the good news is it doesn't take much.,We started with an old van,,a super-fantastic human being,,a great local nonprofit,and $50,000. 
 But we also had to have community trust.,And fortunately, we had builtnthat up in years prior to Better Way.,We have a program calledn"Albuquerque Heading Home,",a Housing First model where we housenthe chronically homeless,,and when I told my communitynwe wanted to do that differently,,I said there's a smart waynto do the right thing.,We have now housed 650 chronicallynhomeless, medically vulnerable --,frankly, most likely to dienon the streets in our city.,We commissioned our university,nthey studied it.,We could tell the taxpayers,nwe can save you 31.6 percent,over the cost of leaving someonento struggle for survival on the streets.,We've now saved over five million dollarsnwhile housing 650 people. 
 So we had that community trust,,but we had to have a little bit morenof an honest conversation also,as a community,,because we had to get people to understand,that when they handnthose five dollars out the window,,they might actually be minimizingntheir opportunity,to help the person in need,nand here's why:,that five dollars might gonto buying some fast food today --,a lot of times it goes to buyingndrugs and alcohol.,That same five dollars,,if you gave it to one of our shelters,,could feed seven people today.,And if you gave it to one of our localnfood banks or food pantries,,we could actually feedn20 people with that money. 
 People ask,"Well, Albuquerquenis 600,000 people -- million, metro --,this wouldn't work in our city,nwe're too big, we're too small.",I disagree; if you havenone panhandler on one city block,,you can do this.,If you live in a citynof eight-and-half million people,,you can do this.,It doesn't matter what you do.,It's not the work that you do,nit's the dignity of the work.,You could do anything.,So I think any city could do this.,And people say to me,,"Mayor, that's just a little too simple.,It can't work that way." 
 But I tell you what, friends:,when you go to a street corner,and you engage with a panhandlernwith dignity and respect,,maybe for the first time in years,nmaybe in their life,,and you tell them that you believe in them,and that this is their citynas much as it's your city,,and that you actually need their helpnto make our place better,,and you understand that thisnisn't the answer to all their problems,,but at least it's a start,,an amazing thing happens.,When they get out on the jobsitenand they start working together,,you start seeing amazing things happen.,They see teamwork; they seenthe fact that they can make a difference.,And at the end of the day,,when they get back to St. Martin'snin that old Dodge van,,they're much more likely to sign upnfor whatever services they need --,substance abuse, mental healthncounseling, you name it. 
 So far with our pilot program,,we've offerednabout 1,700 days of day work.,We've connected 216 peoplento permanent employment opportunities.,Twenty people actually qualifiednfor our Housing First model,,Heading Home,,and they've been housed.,And over 150 people have been connected,to mental health substance abuse services,through There's a Better Way. 
 This is me just two weeks ago,,at St. Martin's,,doing our point-in-time survey,that we do every two years.,I'm interviewing a gentlemannwho's homeless, like we do,,getting his information,nfiguring out where he's from,,how he got there,,what we can do to help him.,And you notice he's holding the same signnthat the guy was holding in 2015,,same sign I walked out with here today. 
 So you have to ask yourself:nIs it really making a difference?,Absolutely it's making a difference.,Albuquerque is nownone of the national leaders,in combating some of the most stubbornnand persistent social issues,that we have.,Combined with Albuquerque Heading Home,,the Better Way program,,Albuquerque has reduced unshelterednhomelessness in our city,by 80 percent last year.,Since I took over as mayor,,we've been able to reduce the chronicnhomeless population in our city,by 40 percent.,And by HUD's definition,,we've gotten to functional zero,,which means we've literally endednveteran homelessness,in the city of Albuquerque,,by being intentional. 
 (Applause) 
 So I'm happy to reportnthat other cities are hearing about this,,other mayors are calling us --,Chicago, Seattle, Denver, Dallas --,and are now starting to implement programs,where they bring the dignitynof work to the equation.,And I can't wait to learn from them.,I can't wait to seenwhat their experiment looks like,,what their pilot project looks like,,so we can start takingna collective approach nationally,through the dignity of work.,And I want to commend them --,the mayors, their communities,ntheir nonprofits --,for the work that they're doing. 
 So who's next?,Are you and your city ready to step up?,Are you ready to think differentlynabout these persistent social issues?,Are you ready to lift people upnin your community,through the dignity of work,,and make your citynprofoundly better in many ways?,Well, if you are, my friends,nI promise you there is a better way. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Last year ...,was hell. 
 (Laughter) 
 It was my first time eatingnNigerian "jollof." 
 (Laughter) 
 Actually, in all seriousness,,I was going through a lotnof personal turmoil.,Faced with enormous stress,,I suffered an anxiety attack.,On some days, I could do no work.,On other days,,I just wanted to lay in my bed and cry. 
 My doctor asked if I'd like to speaknwith a mental health professional,about my stress and anxiety.,Mental health?,I clammed up and violentlynshook my head in protest.,I felt a profound sense of a shame.,I felt the weight of stigma.,I have a loving, supportive family,and incredibly loyal friends,,yet I could not entertainnthe idea of speaking to anyone,about my feeling of pain.,I felt suffocatednby the rigid architecture,of our African masculinity.,"People have real problems, Sangu.,Get over yourself!" 
 The first time I heard "mental health,",I was a boarding school studentnfresh off the boat from Ghana,,at the Peddie School in New Jersey.,I had just gone throughnthe brutal experience,of losing seven loved onesnin the same month.,The school nurse,,concerned about what I'd gonenthrough -- God bless her soul --,she inquired about my mental health.,"Is she mental?" I thought.,Does she not know I'm an African man? 
 (Laughter) 
 Like Okonkwo in "Things Fall Apart,",we African men neither processnnor express our emotions.,We deal with our problems. 
 (Applause) 
 We deal with our problems.,I called my brother and laughednabout "Oyibo" people -- white people --,and their strange diseases --,depression, ADD and those "weird things.",Growing up in West Africa,,when people used the term "mental,"nwhat came to mind was a madman,with dirty, dread-locked hair,,bumbling around half-naked on the streets.,We all know this man.,Our parents warned us about him.,"Mommy, mommy, why is he mad?","Drugs!,If you even look at drugs,nyou end up like him." 
 (Laughter) 
 Come down with pneumonia,,and your mother will rush younto the nearest hospital,for medical treatment.,But dare to declare depression,,and your local pastornwill be driving out demons,and blaming witches in your village. 
 According to the WorldnHealth Organization,,mental health is about being able to cope,with the normal stressors of life;,to work productively and fruitfully;,and to be able to makena contribution to your community.,Mental health includes our emotional,npsychological and social well-being.,Globally, 75 percentnof all mental illness cases,can be found in low-income countries.,Yet most African governments,invest less than one percentnof their health care budget,in mental health. 
 Even worse,,we have a severe shortagenof psychiatrists in Africa.,Nigeria, for example,nis estimated to have 200 --,in a country of almost 200 million.,In all of Africa,,90 percent of our peoplenlack access to treatment.,As a result,,we suffer in solitude,,silenced by stigma. 
 We as Africans often respondnto mental health with distance,,ignorance,,guilt,,fear,and anger.,In a study conducted by Arboleda-Flórez,,directly asking, "What is the causenof mental illness?",34 percent of Nigerian respondentsncited drug misuse;,19 percent said divine wrathnand the will of God -- 
 (Laughter) 
 12 percent,,witchcraft and spiritual possession.,But few cited other knownncauses of mental illness,,like genetics,,socioeconomic status,,war,,conflict,or the loss of a loved one.,The stigmatization against mental illness,often results in the ostracizingnand demonizing of sufferers.,Photojournalist Robin Hammondnhas documented some of these abuses ...,in Uganda,,in Somalia,,and here in Nigeria. 
 For me,,the stigma is personal.,In 2009,,I received a frantic callnin the middle of the night.,My best friend in the world --,a brilliant, philosophical,ncharming, hip young man --,was diagnosed with schizophrenia.,I witnessed some of the friendsnwe'd grown up with recoil.,I heard the snickers.,I heard the whispers.,"Did you hear he has gone mad?",(Kru English) "He has gone crazy!",Derogatory, demeaning commentarynabout his condition --,words we would never saynabout someone with cancer,or someone with malaria.,Somehow, when it comes to mental illness,,our ignorance eviscerates all empathy.,I stood by his sidenas his community isolated him,,but our love never wavered. 
 Tacitly, I became passionatenabout mental health.,Inspired by his plight,,I helped found the mental healthnspecial interest alumni group,at my college.,And during my tenure as a residentntutor in graduate school,,I supported many undergraduatesnwith their mental health challenges.,I saw African students struggle,and unable to speak to anyone.,Even with this knowledgenand with their stories in tow,,I, in turn, struggled,,and could not speak to anyonenwhen I faced my own anxiety,,so deep is our fear of being the madman. 
 All of us --,but we Africans especially --,need to realize that our mental strugglesndo not detract from our virility,,nor does our trauma taint our strength.,We need to see mental healthnas important as physical health.,We need to stop suffering in silence.,We must stop stigmatizing disease,and traumatizing the afflicted. 
 Talk to your friends.,Talk to your loved ones.,Talk to health professionals.,Be vulnerable.,Do so with the confidence,that you are not alone.,Speak up if you're struggling.,Being honest about how we feel,does not make us weak;,it makes us human. 
 It is time to end the stigmanassociated with mental illness.,So the next time your hear "mental,",do not just think of the madman.,Think of me. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I want to tell you a story about a girl.,But I can't tell you her real name.,So let's just call her Hadiza. 
 Hadiza is 20.,She's shy,,but she has a beautiful smilenthat lights up her face.,But she's in constant pain.,And she will likely be on medicationnfor the rest of her life. 
 Do you want to know why?,Hadiza is a Chibok girl,,and on April 14, 2014, she was kidnapped,by Boko Haram terrorists.,She managed to escape, though,,by jumping off the trucknthat was carrying the girls.,But when she landed,nshe broke both her legs,,and she had to crawl on her tummynto hide in the bushes.,She told me she was terrifiednthat Boko Haram would come back for her.,She was one of 57 girls who would escapenby jumping off trucks that day. 
 This story, quite rightly, caused ripples,around the world.,People like Michelle Obama,nMalala and others,lent their voices in protest,,and at about the same time --nI was living in London at the time --,I was sent from London to Abujanto cover the World Economic Forum,that Nigeria was hostingnfor the first time.,But when we arrived, it was clearnthat there was only one story in town.,We put the government under pressure.,We asked tough questionsnabout what they were doing,to bring these girls back.,Understandably,,they weren't too happynwith our line of questioning,,and let's just say we receivednour fair share of "alternative facts." 
 (Laughter) 
 Influential Nigeriansnwere telling us at the time,that we were naïve,,we didn't understandnthe political situation in Nigeria.,But they also told us,that the story of the Chibok girls,was a hoax.,Sadly, this hoax narrative has persisted,,and there are still peoplenin Nigeria today,who believe that the Chibok girlsnwere never kidnapped.,Yet I was talking to people like these --,devastated parents,,who told us that on the daynBoko Haram kidnapped their daughters,,they ran into the Sambisa Forestnafter the trucks carrying their daughters.,They were armed with machetes,nbut they were forced to turn back,because Boko Haram had guns. 
 For two years, inevitably,nthe news agenda moved on,,and for two years,,we didn't hear muchnabout the Chibok girls.,Everyone presumed they were dead.,But in April last year,,I was able to obtain this video.,This is a still from the video,that Boko Haram filmed as a proof of life,,and through a source,nI obtained this video.,But before I could publish it,,I had to travelnto the northeast of Nigeria,to talk to the parents, to verify it.,I didn't have to waitntoo long for confirmation.,One of the mothers,nwhen she watched the video, told me,that if she could have reachedninto the laptop,and pulled our her child from the laptop,,she would have done so.,For those of you who are parents,nlike myself, in the audience,,you can only imagine the anguish,that that mother felt. 
 This video would go on to kick-startnnegotiation talks with Boko Haram.,And a Nigerian senator told menthat because of this video,they entered into those talks,,because they had long presumednthat the Chibok girls were dead.,Twenty-one girls were freednin October last year.,Sadly, nearly 200 of themnstill remain missing. 
 I must confess that I have not beenna dispassionate observer,covering this story.,I am furious when I thinknabout the wasted opportunities,to rescue these girls.,I am furious when I think aboutnwhat the parents have told me,,that if these were daughtersnof the rich and the powerful,,they would have been found much earlier.,And I am furious,that the hoax narrative,,I firmly believe,,caused a delay;,it was part of the reasonnfor the delay in their return. 
 This illustrates to menthe deadly danger of fake news.,So what can we do about it?,There are some very smart people,,smart engineers at Google and Facebook,,who are trying to use technologynto stop the spread of fake news.,But beyond that, I thinkneverybody here -- you and I --,we have a role to play in that.,We are the ones who share the content.,We are the ones who sharenthe stories online.,In this day and age, we're all publishers,,and we have responsibility. 
 In my job as a journalist,,I check, I verify.,I trust my gut, but I ask tough questions.,Why is this person telling me this story?,What do they have to gainnby sharing this information?,Do they have a hidden agenda?,I really believe that we must all startnto ask tougher questions,of information that we discover online. 
 Research shows that some of usndon't even read beyond headlines,before we share stories.,Who here has done that?,I know I have.,But what if,we stopped taking informationnthat we discover at face value?,What if we stop to thinknabout the consequence,of the information that we pass on,and its potential to incitenviolence or hatred?,What if we stop to thinknabout the real-life consequences,of the information that we share? 
 Thank you very much for listening. 
 (Applause)Twenty years ago,,when I was a barristernand human rights lawyer,in full-time legal practice in London,,and the highest court in the land,still convened, some would saynby an accident of history,,in this building here,,I met a young mannwho had just quit his job,in the British Foreign Office.,When I asked him, "Why did you leave,",he told me this story. 
 He had gone to his bossnone morning and said,,"Let's do somethingnabout human rights abuses in China.",And his boss had replied,,"We can't do anythingnabout human rights abuses in China,because we haventrade relations with China." 
 So my friend went awaynwith his tail between his legs,,and six months later,nhe returned again to his boss,,and he said this time,,"Let's do somethingnabout human rights in Burma,",as it was then called. 
 His boss once again paused,and said, "Oh, but we can'tndo anything about human rights in Burma,because we don't havenany trade relations with Burma." 
 (Laughter) 
 This was the momentnhe knew he had to leave.,It wasn't just the hypocrisynthat got to him.,It was the unwillingness of his government,to engage in conflictnwith other governments,,in tense discussions,,all the while, innocent peoplenwere being harmed. 
 We are constantly told,that conflict is bad,that compromise is good;,that conflict is bad,but consensus is good;,that conflict is bad,and collaboration is good.,But in my view,,that's far too simplena vision of the world.,We cannot know,whether conflict is bad,unless we know who is fighting,,why they are fighting,and how they are fighting.,And compromises can be thoroughly rotten,if they harm peoplenwho are not at the table,,people who are vulnerable, disempowered,,people whom we havenan obligation to protect. 
 Now, you might bensomewhat skeptical of a lawyer,arguing about the benefits of conflict,and creating problems for compromise,,but I did also qualify as a mediator,,and these days, I spend my timengiving talks about ethics for free.,So as my bank manager likes to remind me,nI'm downwardly mobile.,But if you accept my argument,,it should change not just the waynwe lead our personal lives,,which I wish to putnto one side for the moment,,but it will change the waynwe think about major problems,of public health and the environment.,Let me explain. 
 Every middle schoolernin the United States,,my 12-year-old daughter included,,learns that there arenthree branches of government,,the legislative, the executivenand the judicial branch.,James Madison wrote,,"If there is any principlenmore sacred in our Constitution,,and indeed in any free constitution,,than any other,,it is that which separates,the legislative, the executivenand the judicial powers.",Now, the framers were not just concerned,about the concentrationnand exercise of power.,They also understoodnthe perils of influence.,Judges cannot determinenthe constitutionality of laws,if they participate in making those laws,,nor can they hold the other branchesnof government accountable,if they collaborate with them,or enter into closenrelationships with them.,The Constitution is,nas one famous scholar put it,,"an invitation to struggle.",And we the people are served,when those branches do, indeed,nstruggle with each other. 
 Now, we recognizenthe importance of struggle,not just in the public sector,between our branches of government.,We also know it too in the private sector,,in relationships among corporations.,Let's imagine that two American airlinesnget together and agree,that they will not drop the price,of their economy class airfaresnbelow 250 dollars a ticket.,That is collaboration,nsome would say collusion,,not competition,,and we the people are harmed,because we pay more for our tickets.,Imagine similarlyntwo airlines were to say,,"Look, Airline A, we'll takenthe route from LA to Chicago,",and Airline B says, "We'll takenthe route from Chicago to DC,,and we won't compete.",Once again, that's collaborationnor collusion instead of competition,,and we the people are harmed. 
 So we understandnthe importance of struggle,when it comes to relationshipsnbetween branches of government,,the public sector.,We also understandnthe importance of conflict,when it comes to relationshipsnamong corporations,,the private sector.,But where we have forgotten it,is in the relationshipsnbetween the public and the private.,And governments all over the worldnare collaborating with industry,to solve problems of public healthnand the environment,,often collaboratingnwith the very corporations,that are creating or exacerbatingnthe problems they are trying to solve.,We are told that these relationships,are a win-win.,But what if someone is losing out? 
 Let me give you some examples.,A United Nations agencyndecided to address a serious problem:,poor sanitation in schools in rural India.,They did so not just in collaborationnwith national and local governments,but also with a television company,and with a majornmultinational soda company.,In exchange for lessnthan one million dollars,,that corporation received the benefitsnof a months-long promotional campaign,including a 12-hour telethon,all using the company's logonand color scheme.,This was an arrangement,which was totally understandable,from the corporation's point of view.,It enhances the reputation of the company,and it creates brand loyaltynfor its products.,But in my view,,this is profoundly problematicnfor the intergovernmental agency,,an agency that has a missionnto promote sustainable living.,By increasing consumptionnof sugar-sweetened beverages,made from scarce local water suppliesnand drunk out of plastic bottles,in a country that is alreadyngrappling with obesity,,this is neither sustainablenfrom a public health,nor an environmental point of view.,And in order to solvenone public health problem,,the agency is sowing the seeds,of another. 
 This is just one examplenof dozens I discovered,in researching a book on the relationshipsnbetween government and industry.,I could also have told younabout the initiatives in parks,in London and throughout Britain,,involving the same company,npromoting exercise,,or indeed of the British governmentncreating voluntary pledges,in partnership with industry,instead of regulating industry.,These collaborations or partnershipsnhave become the paradigm in public health,,and once again, they make sensenfrom the point of view of industry.,It allows them to framenpublic health problems and their solutions,in ways that are least threatening to,,most consonant withntheir commercial interests.,So obesity becomes a problem,of individual decision-making,,of personal behavior,,personal responsibilitynand lack of physical activity.,It is not a problem,,when framed this way,,of a multinational food systemninvolving major corporations. 
 And again, I don't blame industry.,Industry naturally engagesnin strategies of influence,to promote its commercial interests.,But governments have a responsibility,to develop counterstrategies,to protect us,and the common good. 
 The mistake that governments are making,when they collaborate in this way,with industry,is that they conflate,the common good,with common ground.,When you collaborate with industry,,you necessarily put off the table,things that might promote the common goodnto which industry will not agree.,Industry will not agreento increased regulation,unless it believes this willnstave off even more regulation,or perhaps knock some competitorsnout of the market.,Nor can companies agreento do certain things,,for example raise the pricesnof their unhealthy products,,because that would violatencompetition law,,as we've established.,So our governments should not confound,the common good and common ground,,especially when common groundnmeans reaching agreement with industry. 
 I want to give you another example,,moving from high-profile collaboration,to something that is below ground,both literally and figuratively:,the hydraulic fracturing of natural gas.,Imagine that you purchase a plot of land,not knowing the mineral rightsnhave been sold.,This is before the fracking boom.,You build your dream home on that plot,,and shortly afterwards,,you discover that a gas companynis building a well pad on your land.,That was the plightnof the Hallowich family.,Within a very short period of time,,they began to complain of headaches,,of sore throats, of itchy eyes,,in addition to the interferencenof the noise, vibration,and the bright lightsnfrom the flaring of natural gas.,They were very vocal in their criticisms,,and then they fell silent.,And thanks to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,nwhere this image appeared,,and one other newspaper,nwe discovered why they fell silent.,The newspapers went to the court and said,n"What happened to the Hallowiches?",And it turned out the Hallowichesnhad made a secret settlement,with the gas operators, and it wasna take-it-or-leave-it settlement.,The gas company said,,you can have a six-figure sum,to move elsewherenand start your lives again,,but in return,you must promise not to speaknof your experience with our company,,not to speak of yournexperience with fracking,,not to speak about the health consequences,that might have been revealednby a medical examination.,Now, I do not blamenthe Hallowiches for accepting,a take-it-or-leave-it settlement,and starting their lives elsewhere.,And one can understand,why the company would wishnto silence a squeaky wheel.,What I want to point the finger atnis the legal and regulatory system,,a system in which there arennetworks of agreements,just like this one,which serve to silence peoplenand seal off data points,from public health expertsnand epidemiologists,,a system in which regulators,will even refrainnfrom issuing a violation notice,in the event of pollution,if the landowner and the gas company,agree to settle.,This is a system which isn't justnbad from a public health point of view;,it exposes hazards to local families,who remain in the dark. 
 Now, I have given you two examplesnnot because they are isolated examples.,They are examples of a systemic problem.,I could share some counterexamples,,the case for examplenof the public official,who sues the pharmaceutical company,for concealing the fact,that its antidepressant increasesnsuicidal thoughts in adolescents.,I can tell you about the regulatornwho went after the food company,for exaggerating the purportednhealth benefits of its yogurt.,And I can tell you about the legislator,who despite heavy lobbyingndirected at both sides of the aisle,pushes for environmental protections.,These are isolated examples,,but they are beacons of lightnin the darkness,,and they can show us the way. 
 I began by suggesting that sometimesnwe need to engage in conflict.,Governments should tussle with,,struggle with, at times engagenin direct conflict with corporations.,This is not because governmentsnare inherently good,and corporations are inherently evil.,Each is capable of good or ill.,But corporations understandablynact to promote their commercial interests,,and they do so either sometimesnundermining or promoting the common good.,But it is the responsibilitynof governments,to protect and promote the common good.,And we should insist,that they fight to do so.,This is because governments,are the guardians,of public health;,governments are the guardians,of the environment;,and it is governments,that are guardians,of these essential partsnof our common good. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Two months ago, my kids and Inhuddled around a cell phone,watching the live streamnof the Game Awards,,one of the video gamenindustry's biggest nights.,They announced the nomineesnfor the Game for Impact,,an award that's givennto a thought-provoking video game,with a profound prosocialnmessage or meaning.,They opened the envelope,and they read the title of our video game.,An award ...,for impact.,It was almost funny, actually,,because I always thoughtnthat winning an award like that,would have this huge impact on my life,,but I found that the opposite is true. 
 The big nights,,the accomplishments --,they fade.,But the hardest nights of my lifenhave stuck with me,,impacting who I am,and what I do. 
 In 2010, my third son, Joel, was diagnosednwith a rare and aggressive brain tumor.,And before that year was finished,,doctors sat my husband and I down,and let us knownthat his tumor had returned,despite the most aggressive chemotherapynand radiation that they could offer him.,On that terrible night,,after learning that Joelnhad perhaps four months to live,,I cuddled up withnmy two older sons in bed --,they were five and three at the time --,and I never really knewnhow much they understood,,so I started telling them a bedtime story.,I told them about thisnvery brave knight named Joel,and his adventure fightingna terrible dragon called cancer.,Every night, I told themnmore of the story,,but I never let the story end.,I was just building up a contextnthat they could understand,and hoping that our prayersnwould be answered,and I would nevernhave to tell them that that knight,,who had fought so bravely,,was done fighting,and could rest now, forever. 
 Fortunately, I never did have tonfinish that bedtime story.,My children outgrew it.,Joel responded better than anyone expectednto palliative treatment,,and so instead of months,,we spent years learning how to lovenour dying child with all of our hearts.,Learning to recognizenthat shameful feeling,of holding back just a little love,to try to spare ourselvesnjust a little pain,somewhere further down the road.,We pushed past that self-preservation,because Joel was worth lovingneven if that love could crush us.,And that lesson of intensenvulnerability has changed me ...,more than any award ever could. 
 We started living like Joel could live,,and we began developing a video gamencalled "That Dragon, Cancer.",It was the story of Joel.,It was the story of hopenin the shadow of death.,It was the story of faith,and doubt,,and the realization that a wrestlenwith doubt is a part of faith --,maybe the biggest part of it.,It was a story that began as a miracle,and ended as a memorial.

 [That Dragon, Cancer] 
 (Music) 
 When you play "That Dragon, Cancer,",you're transformedninto a witness of Joel's life,,exploring an emotional landscape,,clicking to discover more of whatnwe as a family felt and experienced.,It feels a little bitnlike analyzing interactive poetry,because every game mechanic is a metaphor,,and so the more the player asks themselves,what we as designersnwere trying to express and why,,the richer the experience becomes. 
 We took that vulnerabilitynthat Joel taught us,,and we encoded the game with it.,Players expect their video gamesnto offer them branching narrative,so that every decisionnthat they make feels important,and can change the outcome of the game.,We subverted that principlenof game design,,collapsing the choices in on the player,so that they discover for themselves,that there is nothing that they can donthat will change the outcome for Joel.,And they feel that discoverynas deeply and desperately as we felt it,on nights when we held Joelnin our arms praying for hours,,stubbornly holding out hope for a gracenthat we could not create for ourselves. 
 We'd all prefer to win,,but when you discover that you can't win,,what do you value instead? 
 I never planned to write video games,,but these momentsnthat really change our lives,,they often come as the resultnof our hardship -- and not our glory.,When we thought that Joel could live,,I left the game designing to my husband.,I chimed in here and there,with a scene or two and some suggestions.,But after the night that Joel died,,the passion,,the possibility of sharing Joel's lifenthrough our video game --,it was something that I couldn't resist.,I started writing more,,I sat in on our team's design meetings,,I added more ideasnand I helped direct scenes.,And I discovered that creatingna video game is telling a story,,but with an entirely new vocabulary.,All the same elements of imaginationnand symbolism are there,,but they're just partnerednwith player agency,and system responsiveness.,It's challenging work.,I have to thinknin a totally new way to do it,,but I love it.,And I wouldn't have knownnthat without Joel. 
 Maybe you're a little surprised,by our choice to share our storynof terminal cancer through a video game.,Perhaps you're even thinkingnlike so many people before you:,cancer is not a game.,Well, tell thatnto any pediatric cancer parent,that's ever taken an exam glovenand blown it up into a balloon,,or transformed a syringeninto a rocket ship,,or let their child ride their IV polenthrough the hospital halls,like it was a race car.,Because when you have children,,everything is a game.,And when your young childnexperiences something traumatic,,you work even harder to make surenthat their life feels like a game,because children naturallynexplore their worlds through play.,While cancer can stealnmany things from a family,,it shouldn't steal play. 
 If you're listening to menand you're trying to imagine this family,that revolves entirelynaround a dying child,,and you can't imagine joynas part of that picture,,then we were rightnto share our story with you,,because that season of our life was hard.,Unspeakably hard at times,,but it was also pure hope,,deep love,and joy like I have nevernexperienced since.,Our video game was our attemptnto share that world,with people who hadn'tnexperienced it before,,because we never could imaginenthat world until it became ours. 
 We made a video game that's hard to play.,It will never be a blockbuster.,People have to prepare themselvesnto invest emotionally,in a story that they knownwill break their hearts.,But when our hearts break,,they heal a little differently.,My broken heart has been healingnwith a new and a deeper compassion --,a desire to sit with people in their pain,,to hear their storiesnand try to help tell them,so that they know that they're seen. 
 On the night when "That Dragon, Cancer"nwon the Game for Impact Award,,we cheered,,we smiled and we talked about Joel,and the impact he had on our life --,on all of those hard and hopeful nightsnthat we shared with him,when he changed our hearts,and taught us so much morenabout life and love and faith and purpose.,That award will never mean as much to menas even a single photograph of my son,,but it does represent all of the peoplenwho his life has impacted,,people I'll never meet.,They write me emails sometimes.,They tell me that they miss Joel,neven though they never met him.,They describe the tearsnthat they've shed for my son,,and it makes my burden of griefnjust a little bit lighter,knowing that it's sharednwith a 10-year-old,watching a YouTube playthrough,,or a doctor playing on his airplanenwith a smartphone,,or a professor introducing Joelnto her first-year philosophy students. 
 We made a video game that's hard to play.,But that feels just right to me,,because the hardest moments of our lives,change us more than any goalnwe could ever accomplish.,Tragedy has shifted my heart,more than any dreamnI could ever see come true. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I was a blue-eyed,nchubby-cheeked five-year-old,when I joined my familynon the picket line for the first time.,My mom made me leavenmy dolls in the minivan.,I'd stand on a street cornernin the heavy Kansas humidity,,surrounded by a few dozen relatives,,with my tiny fists clutchingna sign that I couldn't read yet:,"Gays are worthy of death.",This was the beginning. 
 Our protests soon becamena daily occurrence,and an international phenomenon,,and as a membernof Westboro Baptist Church,,I became a fixturenon picket lines across the country.,The end of my antigay picketing career,and life as I knew it,,came 20 years later,,triggered in part by strangers on Twitter,who showed me the powernof engaging the other. 
 In my home,,life was framed as an epicnspiritual battle between good and evil.,The good was my church and its members,,and the evil was everyone else.,My church's antics were such,that we were constantlynat odds with the world,,and that reinforcednour otherness on a daily basis.,"Make a differencenbetween the unclean and the clean,",the verse says,,and so we did.,From baseball games to military funerals,,we trekked across the countrynwith neon protest signs in hand,to tell others exactlynhow "unclean" they were,and exactly whynthey were headed for damnation.,This was the focus of our whole lives.,This was the only way for me to do goodnin a world that sits in Satan's lap.,And like the rest of my 10 siblings,,I believed what I was taughtnwith all my heart,,and I pursued Westboro's agendanwith a special sort of zeal. 
 In 2009, that zeal brought me to Twitter.,Initially, the peoplenI encountered on the platform,were just as hostile as I expected.,They were the digital versionnof the screaming hordes,I'd been seeing at protestsnsince I was a kid.,But in the midst of that digital brawl,,a strange pattern developed.,Someone would arrive at my profilenwith the usual rage and scorn,,I would respond with a custom mixnof Bible verses, pop culture references,and smiley faces.,They would be understandablynconfused and caught off guard,,but then a conversation would ensue.,And it was civil --,full of genuine curiosity on both sides.,How had the other come to suchnoutrageous conclusions about the world? 
 Sometimes the conversationneven bled into real life.,People I'd sparred with on Twitter,would come outnto the picket line to see me,when I protested in their city.,A man named David was one such person.,He ran a blog called "Jewlicious,",and after several monthsnof heated but friendly arguments online,,he came out to see menat a picket in New Orleans.,He brought me a Middle Eastern dessertnfrom Jerusalem, where he lives,,and I brought him kosher chocolate,and held a "God hates Jews" sign. 
 (Laughter) 
 There was no confusionnabout our positions,,but the line between friend and foenwas becoming blurred.,We'd started to see each othernas human beings,,and it changed the waynwe spoke to one another. 
 It took time,,but eventually these conversationsnplanted seeds of doubt in me.,My friends on Twitter took the timento understand Westboro's doctrines,,and in doing so,,they were able to find inconsistenciesnI'd missed my entire life.,Why did we advocatenthe death penalty for gays,when Jesus said, "Let he who isnwithout sin cast the first stone?",How could we claim to love our neighbor,while at the same timenpraying for God to destroy them?,The truth is that the care shown to menby these strangers on the internet,was itself a contradiction.,It was growing evidence,that people on the other side were notnthe demons I'd been led to believe. 
 These realizations were life-altering.,Once I saw that we were notnthe ultimate arbiters of divine truth,but flawed human beings,,I couldn't pretend otherwise.,I couldn't justify our actions --,especially our cruel practicenof protesting funerals,and celebrating human tragedy.,These shifts in my perspective,contributed to a larger erosionnof trust in my church,,and eventually it made itnimpossible for me to stay. 
 In spite of overwhelming grief and terror,nI left Westboro in 2012.,In those days just after I left,,the instinct to hidenwas almost paralyzing.,I wanted to hidenfrom the judgement of my family,,who I knew would nevernspeak to me again --,people whose thoughts and opinionsnhad meant everything to me.,And I wanted to hide from the worldnI'd rejected for so long --,people who had no reason at allnto give me a second chance,after a lifetime of antagonism.,And yet, unbelievably,,they did. 
 The world had access to my pastnbecause it was all over the internet --,thousands of tweetsnand hundreds of interviews,,everything from local TV newsnto "The Howard Stern Show" --,but so many embraced menwith open arms anyway.,I wrote an apologynfor the harm I'd caused,,but I also knew that an apologyncould never undo any of it.,All I could do was try to build a new life,and find a way somehownto repair some of the damage.,People had every reasonnto doubt my sincerity,,but most of them didn't.,And --,given my history,,it was more than I could've hoped for --,forgiveness and the benefit of the doubt.,It still amazes me. 
 I spent my first year away from home,adrift with my younger sister,,who had chosen to leave with me.,We walked into an abyss,,but we were shocked to findnthe light and a way forward,in the same communitiesnwe'd targeted for so long.,David,,my "Jewlicious" friend from Twitter,,invited us to spend time amongna Jewish community in Los Angeles.,We slept on couches in the homenof a Hasidic rabbi and his wife,and their four kids --,the same rabbi that I'd protestednthree years earlier,with a sign that said,n"Your rabbi is a whore.",We spent long hours talkingnabout theology and Judaism and life,while we washed dishesnin their kosher kitchen,and chopped vegetables for dinner.,They treated us like family.,They held nothing against us,,and again I was astonished. 
 That period was full of turmoil,,but one part I've returned to often,is a surprising realizationnI had during that time --,that it was a relief and a privilegento let go of the harsh judgments,that instinctively ran through my mindnabout nearly every person I saw.,I realized that now I needed to learn.,I needed to listen. 
 This has been at the frontnof my mind lately,,because I can't help but seenin our public discourse,so many of the same destructive impulsesnthat ruled my former church.,We celebrate tolerance and diversitynmore than at any other time in memory,,and still we grow more and more divided.,We want good things --,justice, equality,nfreedom, dignity, prosperity --,but the path we've chosen,looks so much like the onenI walked away from four years ago.,We've broken the world into us and them,,only emerging from our bunkers long enough,to lob rhetorical grenadesnat the other camp.,We write off half the countrynas out-of-touch liberal elites,or racist misogynist bullies.,No nuance, no complexity, no humanity.,Even when someone does call for empathynand understanding for the other side,,the conversation nearly always devolves,into a debate aboutnwho deserves more empathy.,And just as I learned to do,,we routinely refuse to acknowledgenthe flaws in our positions,or the merits in our opponent's.,Compromise is anathema.,We even target people on our own sidenwhen they dare to question the party line.,This path has brought us cruel,nsniping, deepening polarization,,and even outbreaks of violence.,I remember this path.,It will not take us where we want to go. 
 What gives me hope is thatnwe can do something about this.,The good news is that it's simple,,and the bad news is that it's hard.,We have to talk and listennto people we disagree with.,It's hard because we often can't fathom,how the other sidencame to their positions.,It's hard because righteous indignation,,that sense of certaintynthat ours is the right side,,is so seductive.,It's hard because it meansnextending empathy and compassion,to people who show usnhostility and contempt.,The impulse to respond in kindnis so tempting,,but that isn't who we want to be.,We can resist.,And I will always be inspired to do sonby those people I encountered on Twitter,,apparent enemiesnwho became my beloved friends.,And in the case of one particularlynunderstanding and generous guy,,my husband.,There was nothing specialnabout the way I responded to him.,What was special was their approach.,I thought about it a lotnover the past few years,and I found four thingsnthey did differently,that made real conversation possible.,These four steps were small but powerful,,and I do everything I can to employ themnin difficult conversations today. 
 The first is don't assume bad intent.,My friends on Twitter realized,that even when my wordsnwere aggressive and offensive,,I sincerely believednI was doing the right thing.,Assuming ill motivesnalmost instantly cuts us off,from truly understandingnwhy someone does and believes as they do.,We forget that they're a human being,with a lifetime of experiencenthat shaped their mind,,and we get stucknon that first wave of anger,,and the conversation has a very hard timenever moving beyond it.,But when we assume good or neutral intent,,we give our minds a much strongernframework for dialogue. 
 The second is ask questions.,When we engage peoplenacross ideological divides,,asking questionsnhelps us map the disconnect,between our differing points of view.,That's important becausenwe can't present effective arguments,if we don't understand wherenthe other side is actually coming from,and because it gives them an opportunitynto point out flaws in our positions.,But asking questionsnserves another purpose;,it signals to someonenthat they're being heard.,When my friends on Twitternstopped accusing,and started asking questions,,I almost automatically mirrored them.,Their questions gave me room to speak,,but they also gave me permissionnto ask them questions,and to truly hear their responses.,It fundamentally changednthe dynamic of our conversation. 
 The third is stay calm.,This takes practice and patience,,but it's powerful.,At Westboro, I learned not to carenhow my manner of speaking affected others.,I thought my rightnessnjustified my rudeness --,harsh tones, raised voices,ninsults, interruptions --,but that strategynis ultimately counterproductive.,Dialing up the volume and the snarknis natural in stressful situations,,but it tends to bring the conversationnto an unsatisfactory, explosive end.,When my husband was stillnjust an anonymous Twitter acquaintance,,our discussions frequentlynbecame hard and pointed,,but we always refused to escalate.,Instead, he would change the subject.,He would tell a joke or recommend a book,or gently excuse himselfnfrom the conversation.,We knew the discussion wasn't over,,just paused for a timento bring us back to an even keel.,People often lament that digitalncommunication makes us less civil,,but this is one advantage that onlinenconversations have over in-person ones.,We have a buffer of time and space,between us and the peoplenwhose ideas we find so frustrating.,We can use that buffer.,Instead of lashing out,nwe can pause, breathe,,change the subject or walk away,,and then come back to it when we're ready. 
 And finally ...,make the argument.,This might seem obvious,,but one side effectnof having strong beliefs,is that we sometimes assume,that the value of our positionnis or should be obvious and self-evident,,that we shouldn'tnhave to defend our positions,because they're so clearly right and good,that if someone doesn't get it,nit's their problem --,that it's not my job to educate them.,But if it were that simple,,we would all see things the same way.,As kind as my friends on Twitter were,,if they hadn't actuallynmade their arguments,,it would've been so much harder for mento see the world in a different way.,We are all a product of our upbringing,,and our beliefs reflect our experiences.,We can't expect othersnto spontaneously change their own minds.,If we want change,,we have to make the case for it. 
 My friends on Twitter didn't abandonntheir beliefs or their principles --,only their scorn.,They channeled theirninfinitely justifiable offense,and came to me with pointed questionsntempered with kindness and humor.,They approached me as a human being,,and that was more transformative,than two full decadesnof outrage, disdain and violence.,I know that some might not haventhe time or the energy or the patience,for extensive engagement,,but as difficult as it can be,,reaching out to someone we disagree with,is an option that isnavailable to all of us.,And I sincerely believenthat we can do hard things,,not just for themnbut for us and our future.,Escalating disgustnand intractable conflict,are not what we want for ourselves,,or our country,or our next generation. 
 My mom said something to mena few weeks before I left Westboro,,when I was desperately hoping,there was a waynI could stay with my family.,People I have lovednwith every pulse of my heart,since even before I wasnthat chubby-cheeked five-year-old,,standing on a picket linenholding a sign I couldn't read.,She said, "You're just a human being,,my dear, sweet child.",She was asking me to be humble --,not to questionnbut to trust God and my elders.,But to me, she was missingnthe bigger picture --,that we're all just human beings.,That we should be guidednby that most basic fact,,and approach one anothernwith generosity and compassion. 
 Each one of usncontributes to the communities,and the cultures and the societiesnthat we make up.,The end of this spiral of rage and blamenbegins with one person,who refuses to indulgenthese destructive, seductive impulses.,We just have to decidenthat it's going to start with us. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm going to be talkingnabout statistics today.,If that makes you immediately feelna little bit wary, that's OK,,that doesn't make you somenkind of crazy conspiracy theorist,,it makes you skeptical.,And when it comes to numbers,nespecially now, you should be skeptical.,But you should also be able to tellnwhich numbers are reliable,and which ones aren't.,So today I want to try to give younsome tools to be able to do that.,But before I do,,I just want to clarify which numbersnI'm talking about here.,I'm not talking about claims like,,"9 out of 10 women recommendnthis anti-aging cream.",I think a lot of us alwaysnroll our eyes at numbers like that.,What's different now is peoplenare questioning statistics like,,"The US unemploymentnrate is five percent.",What makes this claim different isnit doesn't come from a private company,,it comes from the government. 
 About 4 out of 10 Americansndistrust the economic data,that gets reported by government.,Among supporters of President Trumpnit's even higher;,it's about 7 out of 10.,I don't need to tell anyone here,that there are a lot of dividing linesnin our society right now,,and a lot of them start to make sense,,once you understand people's relationshipsnwith these government numbers.,On the one hand, there are those who saynthese statistics are crucial,,that we need them to make sensenof society as a whole,in order to move beyondnemotional anecdotes,and measure progressnin an [objective] way.,And then there are the others,,who say that these statistics are elitist,,maybe even rigged;,they don't make sensenand they don't really reflect,what's happeningnin people's everyday lives. 
 It kind of feels like that second groupnis winning the argument right now.,We're living in a worldnof alternative facts,,where people don't find statisticsnthis kind of common ground,,this starting point for debate.,This is a problem.,There are actuallynmoves in the US right now,to get rid of some governmentnstatistics altogether.,Right now there's a bill in congressnabout measuring racial inequality.,The draft law says that governmentnmoney should not be used,to collect data on racial segregation.,This is a total disaster.,If we don't have this data,,how can we observe discrimination,,let alone fix it?,In other words:,How can a government create fair policies,if they can't measurencurrent levels of unfairness?,This isn't just about discrimination,,it's everything -- think about it.,How can we legislate on health care,if we don't have good datanon health or poverty?,How can we have public debatenabout immigration,if we can't at least agree,on how many people are enteringnand leaving the country?,Statistics come from the state;nthat's where they got their name.,The point was to betternmeasure the population,in order to better serve it.,So we need these government numbers,,but we also have to movenbeyond either blindly accepting,or blindly rejecting them.,We need to learn the skillsnto be able to spot bad statistics. 
 I started to learn some of these,when I was workingnin a statistical department,that's part of the United Nations.,Our job was to find out how many Iraqisnhad been forced from their homes,as a result of the war,,and what they needed.,It was really important work,nbut it was also incredibly difficult.,Every single day, we were making decisions,that affected the accuracynof our numbers --,decisions like which partsnof the country we should go to,,who we should speak to,,which questions we should ask.,And I started to feelnreally disillusioned with our work,,because we thought we were doingna really good job,,but the one group of peoplenwho could really tell us were the Iraqis,,and they rarely got the chance to findnour analysis, let alone question it.,So I started to feel really determined,that the one way to makennumbers more accurate,is to have as many people as possiblenbe able to question them. 
 So I became a data journalist.,My job is finding these data setsnand sharing them with the public.,Anyone can do this,nyou don't have to be a geek or a nerd.,You can ignore those words;nthey're used by people,trying to say they're smartnwhile pretending they're humble.,Absolutely anyone can do this. 
 I want to give you guys three questions,that will help you be able to spotnsome bad statistics.,So, question number onenis: Can you see uncertainty?,One of things that's really changednpeople's relationship with numbers,,and even their trust in the media,,has been the use of political polls.,I personally have a lot of issuesnwith political polls,because I think the role of journalistsnis actually to report the facts,and not attempt to predict them,,especially when those predictionsncan actually damage democracy,by signaling to people:ndon't bother to vote for that guy,,he doesn't have a chance.,Let's set that aside for now and talknabout the accuracy of this endeavor. 
 Based on national electionsnin the UK, Italy, Israel,and of course, the most recentnUS presidential election,,using polls to predict electoral outcomes,is about as accurate as using the moonnto predict hospital admissions.,No, seriously, I used actual datanfrom an academic study to draw this.,There are a lot of reasons whynpolling has become so inaccurate.,Our societies have become really diverse,,which makes it difficult for pollstersnto get a really nice representative sample,of the population for their polls.,People are really reluctant to answerntheir phones to pollsters,,and also, shockingly enough,npeople might lie.,But you wouldn't necessarilynknow that to look at the media.,For one thing, the probabilitynof a Hillary Clinton win,was communicated with decimal places.,We don't use decimal placesnto describe the temperature.,How on earth can predicting the behaviornof 230 million voters in this country,be that precise?,And then there were those sleek charts.,See, a lot of data visualizationsnwill overstate certainty, and it works --,these charts can numbnour brains to criticism.,When you hear a statistic,nyou might feel skeptical.,As soon as it's buried in a chart,,it feels like some kindnof objective science,,and it's not. 
 So I was trying to find waysnto better communicate this to people,,to show people the uncertaintynin our numbers.,What I did was I started takingnreal data sets,,and turning them intonhand-drawn visualizations,,so that people can seenhow imprecise the data is;,so people can see that a human did this,,a human found the data and visualized it.,For example, insteadnof finding out the probability,of getting the flu in any given month,,you can see the roughndistribution of flu season.,This is -- 
 (Laughter) 
 a bad shot to show in February.,But it's also more responsiblendata visualization,,because if you were to shownthe exact probabilities,,maybe that would encouragenpeople to get their flu jabs,at the wrong time. 
 The point of these shaky lines,is so that people remembernthese imprecisions,,but also so they don't necessarilynwalk away with a specific number,,but they can remember important facts.,Facts like injustice and inequalitynleave a huge mark on our lives.,Facts like Black Americans and NativenAmericans have shorter life expectancies,than those of other races,,and that isn't changing anytime soon.,Facts like prisoners in the USncan be kept in solitary confinement cells,that are smaller than the sizenof an average parking space. 
 The point of these visualizationsnis also to remind people,of some really importantnstatistical concepts,,concepts like averages.,So let's say you hear a claim like,,"The average swimming pool in the USncontains 6.23 fecal accidents.",That doesn't mean every singlenswimming pool in the country,contains exactly 6.23 turds.,So in order to show that,,I went back to the original data,nwhich comes from the CDC,,who surveyed 47 swimming facilities.,And I just spent one eveningnredistributing poop.,So you can kind of seenhow misleading averages can be. 
 (Laughter) 
 OK, so the second questionnthat you guys should be asking yourselves,to spot bad numbers is:,Can I see myself in the data?,This question is alsonabout averages in a way,,because part of the reasonnwhy people are so frustrated,with these national statistics,,is they don't really tell the storynof who's winning and who's losing,from national policy.,It's easy to understand why peoplenare frustrated with global averages,when they don't match upnwith their personal experiences.,I wanted to show people the wayndata relates to their everyday lives.,I started this advice columnncalled "Dear Mona,",where people would write to menwith questions and concerns,and I'd try to answer them with data.,People asked me anything.,questions like, "Is it normal to sleepnin a separate bed to my wife?","Do people regret their tattoos?","What does it mean to dienof natural causes?" 
 All of these questions are great,nbecause they make you think,about ways to findnand communicate these numbers.,If someone asks you,n"How much pee is a lot of pee?",which is a question that I got asked,,you really want to make surenthat the visualization makes sense,to as many people as possible.,These numbers aren't unavailable.,Sometimes they're just buriednin the appendix of an academic study.,And they're certainly not inscrutable;,if you really wanted to testnthese numbers on urination volume,,you could grab a bottlenand try it for yourself. 
 (Laughter) 
 The point of this isn't necessarily,that every single data setnhas to relate specifically to you.,I'm interested in how many womennwere issued fines in France,for wearing the face veil, or the niqab,,even if I don't live in Francenor wear the face veil.,The point of asking where you fit innis to get as much context as possible.,So it's about zooming outnfrom one data point,,like the unemployment ratenis five percent,,and seeing how it changes over time,,or seeing how it changesnby educational status --,this is why your parents alwaysnwanted you to go to college --,or seeing how it varies by gender.,Nowadays, male unemployment rate is higher,than the female unemployment rate.,Up until the early '80s,nit was the other way around.,This is a story of onenof the biggest changes,that's happened in American society,,and it's all there in that chart,nonce you look beyond the averages.,The axes are everything;,once you change the scale,nyou can change the story. 
 OK, so the third and final questionnthat I want you guys to think about,when you're looking at statistics is:,How was the data collected?,So far, I've only talked about the wayndata is communicated,,but the way it's collectednmatters just as much.,I know this is tough,,because methodologies can be opaquenand actually kind of boring,,but there are some simple stepsnyou can take to check this. 
 I'll use one last example here.,One poll found that 41 percent of Muslimsnin this country support jihad,,which is obviously pretty scary,,and it was reported everywhere in 2015.,When I want to check a number like that,,I'll start off by findingnthe original questionnaire.,It turns out that journalistsnwho reported on that statistic,ignored a questionnlower down on the survey,that asked respondentsnhow they defined "jihad.",And most of them defined it as,,"Muslims' personal, peaceful strugglento be more religious.",Only 16 percent defined it as,n"violent holy war against unbelievers.",This is the really important point:,based on those numbers,nit's totally possible,that no one in the surveynwho defined it as violent holy war,also said they support it.,Those two groups might not overlap at all. 
 It's also worth askingnhow the survey was carried out.,This was something called an opt-in poll,,which means anyone could have found itnon the internet and completed it.,There's no way of knowingnif those people even identified as Muslim.,And finally, there were 600nrespondents in that poll.,There are roughly three millionnMuslims in this country,,according to Pew Research Center.,That means the poll spoke to roughlynone in every 5,000 Muslims,in this country. 
 This is one of the reasons,why government statisticsnare often better than private statistics.,A poll might speak to a couplenhundred people, maybe a thousand,,or if you're L'Oreal, trying to sellnskin care products in 2005,,then you spoke to 48 womennto claim that they work. 
 (Laughter) 
 Private companies don't have a hugeninterest in getting the numbers right,,they just need the right numbers.,Government statisticians aren't like that.,In theory, at least,nthey're totally impartial,,not least because most of them dontheir jobs regardless of who's in power.,They're civil servants.,And to do their jobs properly,,they don't just speaknto a couple hundred people.,Those unemployment numbersnI keep on referencing,come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics,,and to make their estimates,,they speak to over 140,000nbusinesses in this country. 
 I get it, it's frustrating.,If you want to test a statisticnthat comes from a private company,,you can buy the face cream for younand a bunch of friends, test it out,,if it doesn't work,nyou can say the numbers were wrong.,But how do you questionngovernment statistics?,You just keep checking everything.,Find out how they collected the numbers.,Find out if you're seeing everythingnon the chart you need to see.,But don't give up on the numbersnaltogether, because if you do,,we'll be making public policyndecisions in the dark,,using nothing but privateninterests to guide us. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Chris Anderson: Hello.nWelcome to this TED Dialogues.,It's the first of a seriesnthat's going to be done,in response to the currentnpolitical upheaval.,I don't know about you;,I've become quite concerned aboutnthe growing divisiveness in this country,and in the world.,No one's listening to each other. Right?,They aren't.,I mean, it feels like we needna different kind of conversation,,one that's based on -- I don't know,non reason, listening, on understanding,,on a broader context. 
 That's at least what we're going to trynin these TED Dialogues,,starting today.,And we couldn't have anyone with us,who I'd be more excited to kick this off.,This is a mind right here that thinksnpretty much like no one else,on the planet, I would hasten to say.,I'm serious. 
 (Yuval Noah Harari laughs),I'm serious.,He synthesizes historynwith underlying ideas,in a way that kind of takesnyour breath away. 
 So, some of you will knownthis book, "Sapiens.",Has anyone here read "Sapiens"? 
 (Applause),I mean, I could not put it down.,The way that he tells the story of mankind,through big ideas that really make younthink differently --,it's kind of amazing.,And here's the follow-up,,which I think is being publishednin the US next week. 
 YNH: Yeah, next week. 
 CA: "Homo Deus.",Now, this is the historynof the next hundred years.,I've had a chance to read it.,It's extremely dramatic,,and I daresay, for some people,nquite alarming.,It's a must-read.,And honestly, we couldn't havensomeone better to help,make sense of what on Earthnis happening in the world right now.,So a warm welcome, please,nto Yuval Noah Harari. 
 (Applause) 
 It's great to be joined by our friendsnon Facebook and around the Web.,Hello, Facebook.,And all of you, as I startnasking questions of Yuval,,come up with your own questions,,and not necessarily aboutnthe political scandal du jour,,but about the broader understandingnof: Where are we heading?,You ready? OK, we're going to go. 
 So here we are, Yuval:,New York City, 2017,nthere's a new president in power,,and shock waves rippling around the world.,What on Earth is happening? 
 YNH: I think the basic thing that happened,is that we have lost our story.,Humans think in stories,,and we try to make sense of the worldnby telling stories.,And for the last few decades,,we had a very simplenand very attractive story,about what's happening in the world.,And the story said that,noh, what's happening is,that the economy is being globalized,,politics is being liberalized,,and the combination of the twonwill create paradise on Earth,,and we just need to keep onnglobalizing the economy,and liberalizing the political system,,and everything will be wonderful.,And 2016 is the moment,when a very large segment,neven of the Western world,,stopped believing in this story.,For good or bad reasons --nit doesn't matter.,People stopped believing in the story,,and when you don't have a story,nyou don't understand what's happening. 
 CA: Part of you believes that that storynwas actually a very effective story.,It worked. 
 YNH: To some extent, yes.,According to some measurements,,we are now in the best time ever,for humankind.,Today, for the first time in history,,more people die from eating too muchnthan from eating too little,,which is an amazing achievement. 
 (Laughter) 
 Also for the first time in history,,more people die from old agenthan from infectious diseases,,and violence is also down.,For the first time in history,,more people commit suicidenthan are killed by crime and terrorism,and war put together.,Statistically, you arenyour own worst enemy.,At least, of all the people in the world,,you are most likelynto be killed by yourself -- 
 (Laughter) 
 which is, again,nvery good news, compared -- 
 (Laughter) 
 compared to the level of violencenthat we saw in previous eras. 
 CA: But this processnof connecting the world,ended up with a large group of peoplenkind of feeling left out,,and they've reacted.,And so we have this bombshell,that's sort of rippingnthrough the whole system.,I mean, what do you makenof what's happened?,It feels like the old waynthat people thought of politics,,the left-right divide,nhas been blown up and replaced.,How should we think of this? 
 YNH: Yeah, the old 20th-centurynpolitical model of left versus right,is now largely irrelevant,,and the real divide todaynis between global and national,,global or local.,And you see it again all over the world,that this is now the main struggle.,We probably need completelynnew political models,and completely new waysnof thinking about politics.,In essence, what you can saynis that we now have global ecology,,we have a global economynbut we have national politics,,and this doesn't work together.,This makes the politicalnsystem ineffective,,because it has no controlnover the forces that shape our life.,And you have basically two solutionsnto this imbalance:,either de-globalize the economynand turn it back into a national economy,,or globalize the political system. 
 CA: So some, I guessnmany liberals out there,view Trump and his governmentnas kind of irredeemably bad,,just awful in every way.,Do you see any underlying narrativenor political philosophy in there,that is at least worth understanding?,How would you articulate that philosophy?,Is it just the philosophy of nationalism? 
 YNH: I think the underlyingnfeeling or idea,is that the political system --nsomething is broken there.,It doesn't empowernthe ordinary person anymore.,It doesn't care so muchnabout the ordinary person anymore,,and I think this diagnosisnof the political disease is correct.,With regard to the answers,nI am far less certain. 
 I think what we are seeingnis the immediate human reaction:,if something doesn't work, let's go back.,And you see it all over the world,,that people, almost nobodynin the political system today,,has any future-oriented visionnof where humankind is going.,Almost everywhere,nyou see retrograde vision:,"Let's make America great again,",like it was great -- I don't know --nin the '50s, in the '80s, sometime,,let's go back there.,And you go to Russiana hundred years after Lenin,,Putin's vision for the future,is basically, ah, let's go backnto the Tsarist empire.,And in Israel, where I come from,,the hottest political visionnof the present is:,"Let's build the temple again.",So let's go back 2,000 years backwards.,So people are thinkingnsometime in the past we've lost it,,and sometimes in the past, it's likenyou've lost your way in the city,,and you say OK, let's go backnto the point where I felt secure,and start again.,I don't think this can work,,but a lot of people,nthis is their gut instinct. 
 CA: But why couldn't it work?,"America First" is a verynappealing slogan in many ways.,Patriotism is, in many ways,na very noble thing.,It's played a rolenin promoting cooperation,among large numbers of people.,Why couldn't you have a worldnorganized in countries,,all of which put themselves first? 
 YNH: For many centuries,neven thousands of years,,patriotism worked quite well.,Of course, it led to wars an so forth,,but we shouldn't focusntoo much on the bad.,There are also many,nmany positive things about patriotism,,and the ability to havena large number of people,care about each other,,sympathize with one another,,and come together for collective action.,If you go back to the first nations,,so, thousands of years ago,,the people who lived alongnthe Yellow River in China --,it was many, many different tribes,and they all depended on the rivernfor survival and for prosperity,,but all of them also sufferednfrom periodical floods,and periodical droughts.,And no tribe could really donanything about it,,because each of them controllednjust a tiny section of the river. 
 And then in a longnand complicated process,,the tribes coalesced togethernto form the Chinese nation,,which controlled the entire Yellow River,and had the ability to bringnhundreds of thousands of people together,to build dams and canalsnand regulate the river,and prevent the worst floods and droughts,and raise the levelnof prosperity for everybody.,And this worked in many placesnaround the world. 
 But in the 21st century,,technology is changing all thatnin a fundamental way.,We are now living -- all peoplenin the world --,are living alongside the same cyber river,,and no single nation can regulatenthis river by itself.,We are all living togethernon a single planet,,which is threatened by our own actions.,And if you don't have some kindnof global cooperation,,nationalism is just not on the right levelnto tackle the problems,,whether it's climate changenor whether it's technological disruption. 
 CA: So it was a beautiful idea,in a world where most of the action,nmost of the issues,,took place on national scale,,but your argument is that the issuesnthat matter most today,no longer take place on a national scalenbut on a global scale. 
 YNH: Exactly. All the major problemsnof the world today,are global in essence,,and they cannot be solved,unless through some kindnof global cooperation.,It's not just climate change,,which is, like, the most obviousnexample people give.,I think more in termsnof technological disruption.,If you think about, for example,nartificial intelligence,,over the next 20, 30 years,pushing hundreds of millions of peoplenout of the job market --,this is a problem on a global level.,It will disrupt the economynof all the countries. 
 And similarly, if you thinknabout, say, bioengineering,and people being afraid of conducting,,I don't know, genetic engineeringnresearch in humans,,it won't help if justna single country, let's say the US,,outlaws all genetic experiments in humans,,but China or North Koreancontinues to do it.,So the US cannot solve it by itself,,and very quickly, the pressure on the USnto do the same will be immense,because we are talking aboutnhigh-risk, high-gain technologies.,If somebody else is doing it,nI can't allow myself to remain behind.,The only way to have regulations,neffective regulations,,on things like genetic engineering,,is to have global regulations.,If you just have national regulations,nnobody would like to stay behind. 
 CA: So this is really interesting.,It seems to me that this may be one key,to provoking at leastna constructive conversation,between the different sides here,,because I think everyone can agreenthat the start point,of a lot of the angernthat's propelled us to where we are,is because of the legitimatenconcerns about job loss.,Work is gone, a traditionalnway of life has gone,,and it's no wondernthat people are furious about that.,And in general, they have blamednglobalism, global elites,,for doing this to themnwithout asking their permission,,and that seems likena legitimate complaint. 
 But what I hear you sayingnis that -- so a key question is:,What is the real cause of job loss,nboth now and going forward?,To the extent that it's about globalism,,then the right response,nyes, is to shut down borders,and keep people outnand change trade agreements and so forth.,But you're saying, I think,,that actually the bigger cause of job lossnis not going to be that at all.,It's going to originatenin technological questions,,and we have no chance of solving that,unless we operate as a connected world. 
 YNH: Yeah, I think that,,I don't know about the present,nbut looking to the future,,it's not the Mexicans or Chinesenwho will take the jobs,from the people in Pennsylvania,,it's the robots and algorithms.,So unless you plan to build a big wallnon the border of California -- 
 (Laughter) 
 the wall on the border with Mexiconis going to be very ineffective.,And I was struck when I watchednthe debates before the election,,I was struck that certainly Trumpndid not even attempt to frighten people,by saying the robots will take your jobs.,Now even if it's not true,nit doesn't matter.,It could have been an extremelyneffective way of frightening people -- 
 (Laughter) 
 and galvanizing people:,"The robots will take your jobs!",And nobody used that line.,And it made me afraid,,because it meantnthat no matter what happens,in universities and laboratories,,and there, there is alreadynan intense debate about it,,but in the mainstream political systemnand among the general public,,people are just unaware,that there could be an immensentechnological disruption --,not in 200 years,nbut in 10, 20, 30 years --,and we have to do something about it now,,partly because most of what we teachnchildren today in school or in college,is going to be completely irrelevantnto the job market of 2040, 2050.,So it's not something we'll neednto think about in 2040.,We need to think todaynwhat to teach the young people. 
 CA: Yeah, no, absolutely.,You've often written aboutnmoments in history,where humankind has ...nentered a new era, unintentionally.,Decisions have been made,ntechnologies have been developed,,and suddenly the world has changed,,possibly in a waynthat's worse for everyone.,So one of the examplesnyou give in "Sapiens",is just the whole agricultural revolution,,which, for an actual personntilling the fields,,they just picked up a 12-hournbackbreaking workday,instead of six hours in the junglenand a much more interesting lifestyle. 
 (Laughter) 
 So are we at another possiblenphase change here,,where we kind of sleepwalk into a futurenthat none of us actually wants? 
 YNH: Yes, very much so.,During the agricultural revolution,,what happened is that immensentechnological and economic revolution,empowered the human collective,,but when you look at actualnindividual lives,,the life of a tiny elitenbecame much better,,and the lives of the majority of peoplenbecame considerably worse.,And this can happen againnin the 21st century.,No doubt the new technologiesnwill empower the human collective.,But we may end up again,with a tiny elite reapingnall the benefits, taking all the fruits,,and the masses of the populationnfinding themselves worse,than they were before,,certainly much worse than this tiny elite. 
 CA: And those elitesnmight not even be human elites.,They might be cyborgs or -- 
 YNH: Yeah, they could benenhanced super humans.,They could be cyborgs.,They could be completelynnonorganic elites.,They could even bennon-conscious algorithms.,What we see now in the worldnis authority shifting away,from humans to algorithms.,More and more decisions --nabout personal lives,,about economic matters,nabout political matters --,are actually being taken by algorithms.,If you ask the bank for a loan,,chances are your fate is decidednby an algorithm, not by a human being.,And the general impressionnis that maybe Homo sapiens just lost it. 
 The world is so complicated,nthere is so much data,,things are changing so fast,,that this thing that evolvednon the African savanna,tens of thousands of years ago --,to cope with a particular environment,,a particular volumenof information and data --,it just can't handle the realitiesnof the 21st century,,and the only thingnthat may be able to handle it,is big-data algorithms.,So no wonder more and more authoritynis shifting from us to the algorithms. 
 CA: So we're in New York Citynfor the first of a series of TED Dialogues,with Yuval Harari,,and there's a Facebook Livenaudience out there.,We're excited to have you with us.,We'll start comingnto some of your questions,and questions of people in the room,in just a few minutes,,so have those coming. 
 Yuval, if you're goingnto make the argument,that we need to get past nationalismnbecause of the coming technological ...,danger, in a way,,presented by so much of what's happening,we've got to havena global conversation about this.,Trouble is, it's hard to get peoplenreally believing that, I don't know,,AI really is an imminentnthreat, and so forth.,The things that people,nsome people at least,,care about much more immediately, perhaps,,is climate change,,perhaps other issues like refugees,nnuclear weapons, and so forth.,Would you argue that wherenwe are right now,that somehow those issuesnneed to be dialed up?,You've talked about climate change,,but Trump has saidnhe doesn't believe in that.,So in a way, your most powerful argument,,you can't actually use to make this case. 
 YNH: Yeah, I think with climate change,,at first sight, it's quite surprising,that there is a very close correlation,between nationalism and climate change.,I mean, almost always, the peoplenwho deny climate change are nationalists.,And at first sight, you think: Why?,What's the connection?,Why don't you have socialistsndenying climate change?,But then, when you thinknabout it, it's obvious --,because nationalism has no solutionnto climate change.,If you want to be a nationalistnin the 21st century,,you have to deny the problem.,If you accept the reality of the problem,nthen you must accept that, yes,,there is still room in the worldnfor patriotism,,there is still room in the worldnfor having special loyalties,and obligations towards your own people,ntowards your own country.,I don't think anybody is reallynthinking of abolishing that. 
 But in order to confront climate change,,we need additional loyaltiesnand commitments,to a level beyond the nation.,And that should not be impossible,,because people can havenseveral layers of loyalty.,You can be loyal to your family,and to your community,and to your nation,,so why can't you also be loyalnto humankind as a whole?,Of course, there are occasionsnwhen it becomes difficult,,what to put first,,but, you know, life is difficult.,Handle it. 
 (Laughter) 
 CA: OK, so I would love to getnsome questions from the audience here.,We've got a microphone here.,Speak into it, and Facebook,nget them coming, too. 
 Howard Morgan: One of the things that hasnclearly made a huge difference,in this country and other countries,is the income distribution inequality,,the dramatic changenin income distribution in the US,from what it was 50 years ago,,and around the world.,Is there anything we can donto affect that?,Because that gets at a lotnof the underlying causes. 
 YNH: So far I haven't heard a veryngood idea about what to do about it,,again, partly because most ideasnremain on the national level,,and the problem is global.,I mean, one idea that we hearnquite a lot about now,is universal basic income.,But this is a problem.,I mean, I think it's a good start,,but it's a problematic idea becausenit's not clear what "universal" is,and it's not clear what "basic" is.,Most people when they speaknabout universal basic income,,they actually mean national basic income.,But the problem is global. 
 Let's say that you have AI and 3D printersntaking away millions of jobs,in Bangladesh,,from all the people who makenmy shirts and my shoes.,So what's going to happen?,The US government will levy taxesnon Google and Apple in California,,and use that to pay basic incomento unemployed Bangladeshis?,If you believe that,nyou can just as well believe,that Santa Claus will comenand solve the problem.,So unless we have really universalnand not national basic income,,the deep problemsnare not going to go away. 
 And also it's not clear what basic is,,because what are basic human needs?,A thousand years ago,njust food and shelter was enough.,But today, people will sayneducation is a basic human need,,it should be part of the package.,But how much? Six years?nTwelve years? PhD?,Similarly, with health care,,let's say that in 20, 30, 40 years,,you'll have expensive treatmentsnthat can extend human life,to 120, I don't know.,Will this be part of the basketnof basic income or not?,It's a very difficult problem,,because in a world where peoplenlose their ability to be employed,,the only thing they are going to getnis this basic income.,So what's part of it is a very,nvery difficult ethical question. 
 CA: There's a bunch of questionsnon how the world affords it as well,,who pays.,There's a question herenfrom Facebook from Lisa Larson:,"How does nationalism in the US now,compare to that betweennWorld War I and World War II,in the last century?" 
 YNH: Well the good news, with regardnto the dangers of nationalism,,we are in a much better positionnthan a century ago.,A century ago, 1917,,Europeans were killingneach other by the millions.,In 2016, with Brexit,nas far as I remember,,a single person lost their life,nan MP who was murdered by some extremist.,Just a single person.,I mean, if Brexit was aboutnBritish independence,,this is the most peacefulnwar of independence in human history.,And let's say that Scotlandnwill now choose to leave the UK,after Brexit. 
 So in the 18th century,,if Scotland wanted -- and the Scotsnwanted several times --,to break out of the control of London,,the reaction of the governmentnin London was to send an army up north,to burn down Edinburghnand massacre the highland tribes.,My guess is that if, in 2018,nthe Scots vote for independence,,the London governmentnwill not send an army up north,to burn down Edinburgh.,Very few people are now willingnto kill or be killed,for Scottish or for British independence.,So for all the talknof the rise of nationalism,and going back to the 1930s,,to the 19th century, in the West at least,,the power of national sentimentsntoday is far, far smaller,than it was a century ago. 
 CA: Although some people now,nyou hear publicly worrying,about whether that might be shifting,,that there could actually benoutbreaks of violence in the US,depending on how things turn out.,Should we be worried about that,,or do you really thinknthings have shifted? 
 YNH: No, we should be worried.,We should be aware of two things.,First of all, don't be hysterical.,We are not backnin the First World War yet.,But on the other hand,ndon't be complacent.,We reached from 1917 to 2017,,not by some divine miracle,,but simply by human decisions,,and if we now start makingnthe wrong decisions,,we could be backnin an analogous situation to 1917,in a few years.,One of the things I know as a historian,is that you should nevernunderestimate human stupidity. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's one of the most powerfulnforces in history,,human stupidity and human violence.,Humans do such crazy thingsnfor no obvious reason,,but again, at the same time,,another very powerful forcenin human history is human wisdom.,We have both. 
 CA: We have with us herenmoral psychologist Jonathan Haidt,,who I think has a question. 
 Jonathan Haidt: Thanks, Yuval.,So you seem to be a fannof global governance,,but when you look at the map of the worldnfrom Transparency International,,which rates the level of corruptionnof political institutions,,it's a vast sea of red with little bitsnof yellow here and there,for those with good institutions.,So if we were to havensome kind of global governance,,what makes you think it would end upnbeing more like Denmark,rather than more like Russia or Honduras,,and aren't there alternatives,,such as we did with CFCs?,There are ways to solve global problemsnwith national governments.,What would world governmentnactually look like,,and why do you think it would work? 
 YNH: Well, I don't knownwhat it would look like.,Nobody still has a model for that.,The main reason we need it,is because many of these issuesnare lose-lose situations.,When you havena win-win situation like trade,,both sides can benefitnfrom a trade agreement,,then this is something you can work out.,Without some kind of global government,,national governments eachnhave an interest in doing it.,But when you have a lose-lose situationnlike with climate change,,it's much more difficult,without some overarchingnauthority, real authority. 
 Now, how to get therenand what would it look like,,I don't know.,And certainly there is no obvious reason,to think that it would look like Denmark,,or that it would be a democracy.,Most likely it wouldn't.,We don't have workable democratic models,for a global government.,So maybe it would look morenlike ancient China,than like modern Denmark.,But still, given the dangersnthat we are facing,,I think the imperative of havingnsome kind of real ability,to force through difficult decisionsnon the global level,is more importantnthan almost anything else. 
 CA: There's a question from Facebook here,,and then we'll get the mic to Andrew.,So, Kat Hebron on Facebook,,calling in from Vail:,"How would developed nations managenthe millions of climate migrants?" 
 YNH: I don't know. 
 CA: That's your answer, Kat. (Laughter) 
 YNH: And I don't thinknthat they know either.,They'll just deny the problem, maybe. 
 CA: But immigration, generally,nis another example of a problem,that's very hard to solvenon a nation-by-nation basis.,One nation can shut its doors,,but maybe that stores upnproblems for the future. 
 YNH: Yes, I mean --nit's another very good case,,especially because it's so much easier,to migrate today,than it was in the Middle Agesnor in ancient times. 
 CA: Yuval, there's a beliefnamong many technologists, certainly,,that political concernsnare kind of overblown,,that actually, political leadersndon't have that much influence,in the world,,that the real determination of humanitynat this point is by science,,by invention, by companies,,by many thingsnother than political leaders,,and it's actually very hardnfor leaders to do much,,so we're actually worryingnabout nothing here. 
 YNH: Well, first, it should be emphasized,that it's true that political leaders'nability to do good is very limited,,but their ability to do harm is unlimited.,There is a basic imbalance here.,You can still press the buttonnand blow everybody up.,You have that kind of ability.,But if you want, for example,nto reduce inequality,,that's very, very difficult.,But to start a war,,you can still do so very easily.,So there is a built-in imbalancenin the political system today,which is very frustrating,,where you cannot do a lot of goodnbut you can still do a lot of harm.,And this makes the political systemnstill a very big concern. 
 CA: So as you look atnwhat's happening today,,and putting your historian's hat on,,do you look back in history at momentsnwhen things were going just fine,and an individual leader really tooknthe world or their country backwards? 
 YNH: There are quite a few examples,,but I should emphasize,nit's never an individual leader.,I mean, somebody put him there,,and somebody allowed himnto continue to be there.,So it's never really just the faultnof a single individual.,There are a lot of peoplenbehind every such individual. 
 CA: Can we have the microphonenhere, please, to Andrew? 
 Andrew Solomon: You've talked a lotnabout the global versus the national,,but increasingly, it seems to me,,the world situationnis in the hands of identity groups.,We look at people within the United States,who have been recruited by ISIS.,We look at these other groupsnwhich have formed,which go outside of national bounds,but still representnsignificant authorities.,How are they to be integratedninto the system,,and how is a diverse set of identitiesnto be made coherent,under either nationalnor global leadership? 
 YNH: Well, the problemnof such diverse identities,is a problem from nationalism as well.,Nationalism believesnin a single, monolithic identity,,and exclusive or at leastnmore extreme versions of nationalism,believe in an exclusive loyaltynto a single identity.,And therefore, nationalism has hadna lot of problems,with people wanting to dividentheir identities,between various groups.,So it's not just a problem, say,nfor a global vision. 
 And I think, again, history shows,that you shouldn't necessarilynthink in such exclusive terms.,If you think that there is justna single identity for a person,,"I am just X, that's it, I can't benseveral things, I can be just that,",that's the start of the problem.,You have religions, you have nations,that sometimes demand exclusive loyalty,,but it's not the only option.,There are many religions and many nations,that enable you to havendiverse identities at the same time. 
 CA: But is one explanationnof what's happened in the last year,that a group of people have gotnfed up with, if you like,,the liberal elites,nfor want of a better term,,obsessing over many, many differentnidentities and them feeling,,"But what about my identity?nI am being completely ignored here.,And by the way, I thoughtnI was the majority"?,And that that's actuallynsparked a lot of the anger. 
 YNH: Yeah. Identity is always problematic,,because identity is always basednon fictional stories,that sooner or later collide with reality.,Almost all identities,,I mean, beyond the levelnof the basic community,of a few dozen people,,are based on a fictional story.,They are not the truth.,They are not the reality.,It's just a story that people inventnand tell one another,and start believing.,And therefore all identitiesnare extremely unstable.,They are not a biological reality.,Sometimes nationalists, for example,,think that the nationnis a biological entity.,It's made of the combinationnof soil and blood,,creates the nation.,But this is just a fictional story. 
 CA: Soil and bloodnkind of makes a gooey mess. 
 (Laughter) 
 YNH: It does, and alsonit messes with your mind,when you think too muchnthat I am a combination of soil and blood.,If you look from a biological perspective,,obviously none of the nationsnthat exist today,existed 5,000 years ago.,Homo sapiens is a social animal,nthat's for sure.,But for millions of years,,Homo sapiens and our hominid ancestorsnlived in small communities,of a few dozen individuals.,Everybody knew everybody else.,Whereas modern nationsnare imagined communities,,in the sense that I don't even knownall these people.,I come from a relativelynsmall nation, Israel,,and of eight million Israelis,,I never met most of them.,I will never meet most of them.,They basically exist here. 
 CA: But in terms of this identity,,this group who feel left outnand perhaps have work taken away,,I mean, in "Homo Deus,",you actually speak of this groupnin one sense expanding,,that so many peoplenmay have their jobs taken away,by technology in some waynthat we could end up with,a really large -- I think you call itna "useless class" --,a class where traditionally,,as viewed by the economy,nthese people have no use. 
 YNH: Yes. 
 CA: How likely a possibility is that?,Is that somethingnwe should be terrified about?,And can we address it in any way? 
 YNH: We should think about itnvery carefully.,I mean, nobody really knowsnwhat the job market will look like,in 2040, 2050.,There is a chancenmany new jobs will appear,,but it's not certain.,And even if new jobs do appear,,it won't necessarily be easy,for a 50-year old unemployed truck driver,made unemployed by self-driving vehicles,,it won't be easynfor an unemployed truck driver,to reinvent himself or herselfnas a designer of virtual worlds. 
 Previously, if you look at the trajectorynof the industrial revolution,,when machines replaced humansnin one type of work,,the solution usually camenfrom low-skill work,in new lines of business.,So you didn't need any morenagricultural workers,,so people moved to workingnin low-skill industrial jobs,,and when this was taken awaynby more and more machines,,people moved to low-skill service jobs.,Now, when people say there willnbe new jobs in the future,,that humans can do better than AI,,that humans can do better than robots,,they usually think about high-skill jobs,,like software engineersndesigning virtual worlds.,Now, I don't see hownan unemployed cashier from Wal-Mart,reinvents herself or himself at 50nas a designer of virtual worlds,,and certainly I don't see,how the millions of unemployednBangladeshi textile workers,will be able to do that.,I mean, if they are going to do it,,we need to start teachingnthe Bangladeshis today,how to be software designers,,and we are not doing it.,So what will they do in 20 years? 
 CA: So it feels like you're reallynhighlighting a question,that's really been bugging menthe last few months more and more.,It's almost a hard questionnto ask in public,,but if any mind has some wisdomnto offer in it, maybe it's yours,,so I'm going to ask you:,What are humans for? 
 YNH: As far as we know, for nothing. 
 (Laughter) 
 I mean, there is no great cosmic drama,nsome great cosmic plan,,that we have a role to play in.,And we just need to discovernwhat our role is,and then play it to the bestnof our ability.,This has been the story of all religionsnand ideologies and so forth,,but as a scientist, the best I can saynis this is not true.,There is no universal dramanwith a role in it for Homo sapiens.,So -- 
 CA: I'm going to push back on younjust for a minute,,just from your own book,,because in "Homo Deus,",you give really one of the most coherentnand understandable accounts,about sentience, about consciousness,,and that unique sort of human skill.,You point out that it's differentnfrom intelligence,,the intelligencenthat we're building in machines,,and that there's actually a lotnof mystery around it.,How can you be sure there's no purpose,when we don't even understandnwhat this sentience thing is?,I mean, in your own thinking,nisn't there a chance,that what humans are fornis to be the universe's sentient things,,to be the centers of joy and lovenand happiness and hope?,And maybe we can build machinesnthat actually help amplify that,,even if they're not going to becomensentient themselves?,Is that crazy?,I kind of found myself hoping that,nreading your book. 
 YNH: Well, I certainly think that the mostninteresting question today in science,is the questionnof consciousness and the mind.,We are getting better and betternin understanding the brain,and intelligence,,but we are not getting much better,in understanding the mindnand consciousness.,People often confuse intelligencenand consciousness,,especially in places like Silicon Valley,,which is understandable,nbecause in humans, they go together.,I mean, intelligence basicallynis the ability to solve problems.,Consciousness is the abilitynto feel things,,to feel joy and sadnessnand boredom and pain and so forth.,In Homo sapiens and all other mammalsnas well -- it's not unique to humans --,in all mammals and birdsnand some other animals,,intelligence and consciousnessngo together.,We often solve problems by feeling things.,So we tend to confuse them.,But they are different things. 
 What's happening todaynin places like Silicon Valley,is that we are creatingnartificial intelligence,but not artificial consciousness.,There has been an amazing developmentnin computer intelligence,over the last 50 years,,and exactly zero developmentnin computer consciousness,,and there is no indication that computersnare going to become conscious,anytime soon. 
 So first of all, if there isnsome cosmic role for consciousness,,it's not unique to Homo sapiens.,Cows are conscious, pigs are conscious,,chimpanzees are conscious,nchickens are conscious,,so if we go that way, first of all,nwe need to broaden our horizons,and remember very clearly we are notnthe only sentient beings on Earth,,and when it comes to sentience --,when it comes to intelligence,nthere is good reason to think,we are the most intelligentnof the whole bunch. 
 But when it comes to sentience,,to say that humans are morensentient than whales,,or more sentient than baboonsnor more sentient than cats,,I see no evidence for that.,So first step is, you gonin that direction, expand.,And then the second questionnof what is it for,,I would reverse it,and I would say that I don't thinknsentience is for anything.,I think we don't neednto find our role in the universe.,The really important thingnis to liberate ourselves from suffering.,What characterizes sentient beings,in contrast to robots, to stones,,to whatever,,is that sentient beingsnsuffer, can suffer,,and what they should focus on,is not finding their placenin some mysterious cosmic drama.,They should focus on understandingnwhat suffering is,,what causes it and hownto be liberated from it. 
 CA: I know this is a big issue for you,nand that was very eloquent.,We're going to have a blizzardnof questions from the audience here,,and maybe from Facebook as well,,and maybe some comments as well.,So let's go quick.,There's one right here.,Keep your hands held upnat the back if you want the mic,,and we'll get it back to you. 
 Question: In your work, you talk a lotnabout the fictional stories,that we accept as truth,,and we live our lives by it.,As an individual, knowing that,,how does it impact the storiesnthat you choose to live your life,,and do you confuse themnwith the truth, like all of us? 
 YNH: I try not to.,I mean, for me, maybe the mostnimportant question,,both as a scientist and as a person,,is how to tell the differencenbetween fiction and reality,,because reality is there.,I'm not saying that everything is fiction.,It's just very difficult for human beingsnto tell the difference,between fiction and reality,,and it has become more and more difficultnas history progressed,,because the fictionsnthat we have created --,nations and gods and moneynand corporations --,they now control the world.,So just to even think,,"Oh, this is just all fictional entitiesnthat we've created,",is very difficult.,But reality is there. 
 For me the best ...,There are several tests,to tell the differencenbetween fiction and reality.,The simplest one, the best onenthat I can say in short,,is the test of suffering.,If it can suffer, it's real.,If it can't suffer, it's not real.,A nation cannot suffer.,That's very, very clear.,Even if a nation loses a war,,we say, "Germany suffered a defeatnin the First World War,",it's a metaphor.,Germany cannot suffer.nGermany has no mind.,Germany has no consciousness.,Germans can suffer, yes,nbut Germany cannot.,Similarly, when a bank goes bust,,the bank cannot suffer.,When the dollar loses its value,nthe dollar doesn't suffer.,People can suffer. Animals can suffer.,This is real.,So I would start, if younreally want to see reality,,I would go through the door of suffering.,If you can really understandnwhat suffering is,,this will give you also the key,to understand what reality is. 
 CA: There's a Facebook questionnhere that connects to this,,from someone around the worldnin a language that I cannot read. 
 YNH: Oh, it's Hebrew.nCA: Hebrew. There you go. 
 (Laughter) 
 Can you read the name? 
 YNH: Or Lauterbach Goren. 
 CA: Well, thank you for writing in.,The question is: "Is the post-truth eranreally a brand-new era,,or just another climax or momentnin a never-ending trend? 
 YNH: Personally, I don't connectnwith this idea of post-truth.,My basic reaction as a historian is:,If this is the era of post-truth,nwhen the hell was the era of truth? 
 CA: Right. 
 (Laughter) 
 YNH: Was it the 1980s, the 1950s,nthe Middle Ages?,I mean, we have always livednin an era, in a way, of post-truth. 
 CA: But I'd push back on that,,because I think what peoplenare talking about,is that there was a worldnwhere you had fewer journalistic outlets,,where there were traditions,nthat things were fact-checked.,It was incorporated into the charternof those organizations,that the truth mattered.,So if you believe in a reality,,then what you write is information.,There was a belief that that informationnshould connect to reality in a real way,,and if you wrote a headline,nit was a serious, earnest attempt,to reflect somethingnthat had actually happened.,And people didn't always get it right. 
 But I think the concern now is you've got,a technological systemnthat's incredibly powerful,that, for a while at least,nmassively amplified anything,with no attention paid to whethernit connected to reality,,only to whether it connectednto clicks and attention,,and that that was arguably toxic.,That's a reasonable concern, isn't it? 
 YNH: Yeah, it is. I mean,nthe technology changes,,and it's now easier to disseminatenboth truth and fiction and falsehood.,It goes both ways.,It's also much easier, though, to spreadnthe truth than it was ever before.,But I don't think therenis anything essentially new,about this disseminatingnfictions and errors.,There is nothing that -- I don't know --nJoseph Goebbels, didn't know,about all this idea of fakennews and post-truth.,He famously said that if you repeatna lie often enough,,people will think it's the truth,,and the bigger the lie, the better,,because people won't even thinknthat something so big can be a lie.,I think that fake newsnhas been with us for thousands of years.,Just think of the Bible. 
 (Laughter) 
 CA: But there is a concern,that the fake news is associatednwith tyrannical regimes,,and when you see an uprise in fake news,that is a canary in the coal minenthat there may be dark times coming. 
 YNH: Yeah. I mean, the intentional usenof fake news is a disturbing sign.,But I'm not saying that it's not bad,nI'm just saying that it's not new. 
 CA: There's a lot of interestnon Facebook on this question,about global governancenversus nationalism.,Question here from Phil Dennis:,"How do we get people, governments,nto relinquish power?,Is that -- is that --nactually, the text is so big,I can't read the full question.,But is that a necessity?,Is it going to take war to get there?,Sorry Phil -- I mangled your question,nbut I blame the text right here. 
 YNH: One optionnthat some people talk about,is that only a catastrophencan shake humankind,and open the path to a real systemnof global governance,,and they say that we can't do itnbefore the catastrophe,,but we need to startnlaying the foundations,so that when the disaster strikes,,we can react quickly.,But people will just not haventhe motivation to do such a thing,before the disaster strikes.,Another thing that I would emphasize,is that anybody who is reallyninterested in global governance,should always make it very, very clear,that it doesn't replace or abolishnlocal identities and communities,,that it should come both as --,It should be part of a single package. 
 CA: I want to hear more on this,,because the very words "global governance",are almost the epitome of evilnin the mindset of a lot of people,on the alt-right right now.,It just seems scary, remote, distant,nand it has let them down,,and so globalists,nglobal governance -- no, go away!,And many view the electionnas the ultimate poke in the eye,to anyone who believes in that.,So how do we change the narrative,so that it doesn't seemnso scary and remote?,Build more on this ideanof it being compatible,with local identity, local communities. 
 YNH: Well, I think again we should start,really with the biological realities,of Homo sapiens.,And biology tells us two thingsnabout Homo sapiens,which are very relevant to this issue:,first of all, that we arencompletely dependent,on the ecological system around us,,and that today we are talkingnabout a global system.,You cannot escape that. 
 And at the same time, biology tells usnabout Homo sapiens,that we are social animals,,but that we are socialnon a very, very local level.,It's just a simple fact of humanity,that we cannot have intimate familiarity,with more than about 150 individuals.,The size of the natural group,,the natural community of Homo sapiens,,is not more than 150 individuals,,and everything beyond that is reallynbased on all kinds of imaginary stories,and large-scale institutions,,and I think that we can find a way,,again, based on a biologicalnunderstanding of our species,,to weave the two together,and to understand that todaynin the 21st century,,we need both the global levelnand the local community. 
 And I would go even further than that,and say that it startsnwith the body itself.,The feelings that people today havenof alienation and loneliness,and not finding their place in the world,,I would think that the chief problemnis not global capitalism.,The chief problem is that overnthe last hundred years,,people have been becoming disembodied,,have been distancing themselvesnfrom their body.,As a hunter-gatherer or even as a peasant,,to survive, you need to benconstantly in touch,with your body and with your senses,,every moment.,If you go to the forestnto look for mushrooms,and you don't pay attentionnto what you hear,,to what you smell, to what you taste,,you're dead.,So you must be very connected. 
 In the last hundred years,npeople are losing their ability,to be in touch with their bodynand their senses,,to hear, to smell, to feel.,More and more attention goes to screens,,to what is happening elsewhere,,some other time.,This, I think, is the deep reason,for the feelings of alienationnand loneliness and so forth,,and therefore part of the solution,is not to bring backnsome mass nationalism,,but also reconnect with our own bodies,,and if you are backnin touch with your body,,you will feel much more at homenin the world also. 
 CA: Well, depending on how things go,nwe may all be back in the forest soon.,We're going to havenone more question in the room,and one more on Facebook. 
 Ama Adi-Dako: Hello. I'm from Ghana,nWest Africa, and my question is:,I'm wondering how do you presentnand justify the idea of global governance,to countries that have beennhistorically disenfranchised,by the effects of globalization,,and also, if we're talking aboutnglobal governance,,it sounds to me like it will definitelyncome from a very Westernized idea,of what the "global"nis supposed to look like.,So how do we present and justifynthat idea of global,versus wholly nationalist,to people in countries like Ghananand Nigeria and Togo,and other countries like that? 
 YNH: I would start by sayingnthat history is extremely unfair,,and that we should realize that.,Many of the countries that suffered most,from the last 200 years of globalization,and imperialism and industrialization,are exactly the countriesnwhich are also most likely to suffer most,from the next wave.,And we should be very,nvery clear about that.,If we don't have a global governance,,and if we suffer from climate change,,from technological disruptions,,the worst suffering will not be in the US.,The worst suffering will be in Ghana,nwill be in Sudan, will be in Syria,,will be in Bangladesh,nwill be in those places. 
 So I think those countriesnhave an even greater incentive,to do something aboutnthe next wave of disruption,,whether it's ecologicalnor whether it's technological.,Again, if you think aboutntechnological disruption,,so if AI and 3D printers and robotsnwill take the jobs,from billions of people,,I worry far less about the Swedes,than about the people in Ghananor in Bangladesh.,And therefore,nbecause history is so unfair,and the results of a calamity,will not be shared equallynbetween everybody,,as usual, the richnwill be able to get away,from the worst consequencesnof climate change,in a way that the poornwill not be able to. 
 CA: And here's a great questionnfrom Cameron Taylor on Facebook:,"At the end of 'Sapiens,'",you said we should be asking the question,,'What do we want to want?',Well, what do you thinknwe should want to want?" 
 YNH: I think we should wantnto want to know the truth,,to understand reality.,Mostly what we want is to change reality,,to fit it to our own desires,nto our own wishes,,and I think we should firstnwant to understand it.,If you look at the long-termntrajectory of history,,what you see is thatnfor thousands of years,we humans have been gainingncontrol of the world outside us,and trying to shape itnto fit our own desires.,And we've gained controlnof the other animals,,of the rivers, of the forests,,and reshaped them completely,,causing an ecological destruction,without making ourselves satisfied. 
 So the next stepnis we turn our gaze inwards,,and we say OK, getting controlnof the world outside us,did not really make us satisfied.,Let's now try to gain controlnof the world inside us.,This is the really big project,of science and technologynand industry in the 21st century --,to try and gain controlnof the world inside us,,to learn how to engineer and producenbodies and brains and minds.,These are likely to be the mainnproducts of the 21st century economy.,When people think about the future,nvery often they think in terms,,"Oh, I want to gain controlnof my body and of my brain.",And I think that's very dangerous. 
 If we've learned anythingnfrom our previous history,,it's that yes, we gainnthe power to manipulate,,but because we didn't reallynunderstand the complexity,of the ecological system,,we are now facing an ecological meltdown.,And if we now try to reengineernthe world inside us,without really understanding it,,especially without understandingnthe complexity of our mental system,,we might cause a kind of internalnecological disaster,,and we'll face a kind of mentalnmeltdown inside us. 
 CA: Putting all the piecesntogether here --,the current politics,nthe coming technology,,concerns like the onenyou've just outlined --,I mean, it seems like you yourselfnare in quite a bleak place,when you think about the future.,You're pretty worried about it.,Is that right?,And if there was one cause for hope,nhow would you state that? 
 YNH: I focus on the mostndangerous possibilities,partly because this is likenmy job or responsibility,as a historian or social critic.,I mean, the industry focuses mainlynon the positive sides,,so it's the job of historiansnand philosophers and sociologists,to highlight the more dangerous potentialnof all these new technologies.,I don't think any of that is inevitable.,Technology is never deterministic.,You can use the same technology,to create very differentnkinds of societies. 
 If you look at the 20th century,,so, the technologiesnof the Industrial Revolution,,the trains and electricity and all that,could be used to createna communist dictatorship,or a fascist regimenor a liberal democracy.,The trains did not tell younwhat to do with them.,Similarly, now, artificial intelligencenand bioengineering and all of that --,they don't predetermine a single outcome.,Humanity can rise up to the challenge,,and the best example we have,of humanity rising upnto the challenge of a new technology,is nuclear weapons.,In the late 1940s, '50s,,many people were convinced,that sooner or later the Cold Warnwill end in a nuclear catastrophe,,destroying human civilization.,And this did not happen.,In fact, nuclear weapons promptednhumans all over the world,to change the way that they manageninternational politics,to reduce violence. 
 And many countries basically took out war,from their political toolkit.,They no longer tried to pursuentheir interests with warfare.,Not all countries have done so,nbut many countries have.,And this is maybenthe most important reason,why international violencendeclined dramatically since 1945,,and today, as I said,nmore people commit suicide,than are killed in war.,So this, I think, gives us a good example,that even the most frightening technology,,humans can rise up to the challenge,and actually some good can come out of it.,The problem is, we have very littlenmargin for error.,If we don't get it right,,we might not havena second option to try again. 
 CA: That's a very powerful note,,on which I think we should drawnthis to a conclusion.,Before I wrap up, I just want to saynone thing to people here,and to the global TED communitynwatching online, anyone watching online:,help us with these dialogues.,If you believe, like we do,,that we need to findna different kind of conversation,,now more than ever, help us do it.,Reach out to other people,,try and have conversationsnwith people you disagree with,,understand them,,pull the pieces together,,and help us figure out how to takenthese conversations forward,so we can make a real contribution,to what's happeningnin the world right now. 
 I think everyone feels more alive,,more concerned, more engaged,with the politics of the moment.,The stakes do seem quite high,,so help us respond to itnin a wise, wise way. 
 Yuval Harari, thank you. 
 (Applause)As you heard, I'm a physicist.,And I think the way we talk about physicsnneeds a little modification.,I am from just down the road here;nI don't live here anymore.,But coming from round here meansnthat I have a northern nana,,my mum's mom.,And Nana is very bright;nshe hasn't had much formal education,,but she's sharp.,And when I was a second-year undergraduatenstudying physics at Cambridge,,I remember spending an afternoonnat Nana's house in Urmston,studying quantum mechanics.,And I had these foldersnopen in front of me,with this, you know,nhieroglyphics -- let's be honest.,And Nana came along,nand she looked at this folder,,and she said, "What's that?",I said, "It's quantum mechanics, Nana.",And I tried to explain somethingnabout what was on the page.,It was to do with the nucleusnand Einstein A and B coefficients.,And Nana looked very impressed.,And then she said, "Oh.,What can you do when you know that?" 
 (Laughter) 
 "Don't know, ma'am." 
 (Laughter) 
 I think I said something about computers,,because it was allnI could think of at the time. 
 But you can broaden that question out,nbecause it's a very good question --,"What can you do when you know that?"nwhen "that" is physics?,And I've come to realize that whennwe talk about physics in society,and our sort of image of it,,we don't include the thingsnthat we can do when we know that.,Our perception of what physics isnneeds a bit of a shift.,Not only does it need a bit of a shift,,but sharing this different perspectivenmatters for our society,,and I'm not just saying thatnbecause I'm a physicist and I'm biased,and I think we're the mostnimportant people in the world.,Honest. 
 So, the image of physics -- we've gotnan image problem, let's be honest --,it hasn't moved on much from this.,This is a very famous photographnthat's from the Solvay Conference in 1927.,This is when the great mindsnof physics were grappling,with the nature of determinism,and what it meansnonly to have a probability,that a particle might be somewhere,,and whether any of it was real.,And it was all very difficult.,And you'll notice they're allnvery stern-looking men in suits.,Marie Curie -- I keep maybe saying,n"Marie Antoinette,",which would be a turn-up for the books --,Marie Curie, third from the leftnon the bottom there,,she was allowed in,nbut had to dress like everybody else. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, this is what physics is like --nthere's all these kinds of hieroglyphics,,these are to do with waves and particles.,That is an artist's impressionnof two black holes colliding,,which makes it looknworth watching, to be honest.,I'm glad I didn't have to writenthe risk assessment,for whatever was going on there.,The point is: this isnthe image of physics, right?,It's weird and difficult,,done by slightly strange peoplendressed in a slightly strange way.,It's inaccessible, it's somewhere else,and fundamentally, why should I care? 
 And the problem with thatnis that I'm a physicist,,and I study this.,This -- this is my job, right?,I study the interfacenbetween the atmosphere and the ocean.,The atmosphere is massive,nthe ocean is massive,,and the thin layernthat joins them together,is really important,,because that's where things gonfrom one huge reservoir to the other.,You can see that the sea surface --nthat was me who took this video --,the average height of those wavesnby the way, was 10 meters.,So this is definitely physicsnhappening here --,there's lots of things --nthis is definitely physics.,And yet it's not includednin our cultural perception of physics,,and that bothers me. 
 So what is includednin our cultural perception of physics?,Because I'm a physicist,nthere has to be a graph, right?,That's allowed.,We've got time along the bottom here,nfrom very fast things there,,to things that take a long time over here.,Small things at the bottom,nbig things up there.,So, our current cultural imagenof physics looks like this.,There's quantum mechanicsndown in that corner,,it's very small, it's very weird,,it happens very quickly,,and it's a long way downnin the general ...,on the scale of anything that mattersnfor everyday life.,And then there's cosmology,nwhich is up there;,very large, very far away,,also very weird.,And if you go to some places,like black holesnin the beginning of the universe,,we know that these are frontiersnin physics, right?,There's lots of work being donento discover new physics,in these places. 
 But the thing is, you will noticenthere's a very large gap in the middle.,And in that gap, there are many things.,There are planets and toastsnand volcanoes and clouds,and clarinets and bubbles and dolphins,and all sorts of thingsnthat make up our everyday life.,And these are also run by physics,nyou'd be surprised --,there is physics in the middle,nit's just that nobody talks about it.,And the thing about all of thesenis that they all run,on a relatively small numbernof physical laws,,things like Newton's laws of motion,,thermodynamics,,some rotational dynamics.,The physics in the middlenapplies over a huge range,,from very, very small thingsnto very, very big things.,You have to try very hardnto get outside of this.,And there is also a frontiernin research physics here,,it's just that nobody talks about it.,This is the world of the complex.,When these laws work together,nthey bring about,the beautiful, messy,ncomplex world we live in. 
 Fundamentally, this is the bitnthat really matters to me,on an everyday basis.,And this is the bitnthat we don't talk about.,There's plenty of physicsnresearch going on here.,But because it doesn't involvenpointing at stars,,people for some reasonnthink it's not that.,Now, the cool thing about thisnis that there are so many things,in this middle bit,,all following the same physical laws,,that we can see those laws at work,almost all the time around us. 
 I've got a little video here.,So the game is, one of these eggs is rawnand one of them has been boiled.,I want you to tell me which one is which.,Which one's raw? 
 (Audience responds) 
 The one on the left -- yes!,And even though you might notnhave tried that, you all knew.,The reason for that is,nyou set them spinning,,and when you stop the cooked egg,nthe one that's completely solid,,you stop the entire egg.,When you stop the other one,nyou only stop the shell;,the liquid inside is still rotatingnbecause nothing's made it stop.,And then it pushes the shell round again,nso the egg starts to rotate again.,This is brilliant, right?,It's a demonstrationnof something in physics,that we call the law of conservationnof angular momentum,,which basically saysnthat if you set something spinning,about a fixed axis,,that it will keep spinningnunless you do something to stop it.,And that's really fundamentalnin how the universe works.,And it's not just eggs that it applies to,,although it's really usefulnif you're the sort of person --,and apparently, these people do exist --,who will boil eggsnand then put them back in the fridge.,Who does that? Don't admit to it --nit's OK. We won't judge you.,But it's also got muchnbroader applicabilities. 
 This is the Hubble Space Telescope.,The Hubble Ultra Deep Field,nwhich is a very tiny part of the sky.,Hubble has been floatingnin free space for 25 years,,not touching anything.,And yet it can pointnto a tiny region of sky.,For 11 and a half days,nit did it in sections,,accurately enoughnto take amazing images like this.,So the question is:,How does somethingnthat is not touching anything,know where it is?,The answer is that right in the middlenof it, it has something,that, to my great disappointment,nisn't a raw egg,,but basically does the same job.,It's got gyroscopes which are spinning,,and because of the lawnof conservation of angular momentum,,they keep spinningnwith the same axis, indefinitely.,Hubble kind of rotates around them,nand so it can orient itself.,So the same little physical lawnwe can play with in the kitchen and use,,also explains what makes possiblensome of the most advanced technology,of our time.,So this is the fun bit of physics,nthat you learn these patterns,and then you can apply themnagain and again and again.,And it's really rewardingnwhen you spot them in new places.,This is the fun of physics. 
 I have shown that egg videonto an audience full of businesspeople once,and they were all dressed up very smartlynand trying to impress their bosses.,And I was running out of time,nso I showed the egg video and then said,,"Well, you can work it out,nand ask me afterwards to check.",Then I left the stage.,And I had, literally,,middle-aged grown menntugging on my sleeve afterwards,,saying, "Is it this? Is it this?",And when I said, "Yes." They went, "Yes!" 
 (Laughter) 
 The joy that you getnfrom spotting these patterns,doesn't go away when you're an adult. 
 And that's really important,,because physics is all about patterns,,and a small number of patternsngive you access,to almost all of the physicsnin our everyday world.,The thing that's best about thisnis it involves playing with toys.,Things like the egg shouldn't be dismissednas the mundane little things,that we just give the kids to play withnon a Saturday afternoon,to keep them quiet.,This is the stuffnthat actually really matters,,because this is the laws of the universenand it applies to eggs,and toast falling butter-side downnand all sorts of other things,,just as much as it appliesnto modern technology,and anything elsenthat's going on in the world.,So I think we should playnwith these patterns. 
 Basically, there are a smallnnumber of concepts,that you can become familiar withnusing things in your kitchen,,that are really usefulnfor life in the outside world.,If you want to learn about thermodynamics,na duck is a good place to start,,for example, why their feetndon't get cold.,Once you've got a bitnof thermodynamics with the duck,,you can also explain fridges.,Magnets that you can play withnin your kitchen,get you to wind turbinesnand modern energy generation.,Raisins in [fizzy] lemonade, which is alwaysna good thing to play with.,If you're at a boring party,nfish some raisins out of the bar snacks,,put them in some lemonade.,It's got three consequences.,First thing is, it's quite goodnto watch; try it.,Secondly, it sends the boring people away.,Thirdly, it bringsnthe interesting people to you.,You win on all fronts.,And then there's spinnand gas laws and viscosity.,There's these little patterns,nand they're right around us everywhere.,And it's fundamentally democratic, right?,Everybody has access to the same physics;nyou don't need a big, posh lab. 
 When I wrote the book,nI had the chapter on spin.,I had written a bitnabout toast falling butter-side down.,I gave the chapter to a friend of minenwho's not a scientist,,for him to read and tell menwhat he thought,,and he took the chapter away.,He was working overseas.,I got this text message back from himna couple of weeks later,,and it said, "I'm at breakfastnin a posh hotel in Switzerland,,and I really wantnto push toast off the table,,because I don't believe what you wrote.",And that was the good bit --nhe doesn't have to.,He can push the toast off the tablenand try it for himself. 
 And so there's two important thingsnto know about science:,the fundamental laws we've learnednthrough experience and experimentation,,work.,The day we drop an apple and it goes up,,then we'll have a debate about gravity.,Up to that point,nwe basically know how gravity works,,and we can learn the framework.,Then there's the processnof experimentation:,having confidence in things,ntrying things out,,critical thinking -- how we movenscience forward --,and you can learn both of those things,by playing with toysnin the everyday world. 
 And it's really important,,because there's all this talknabout technology,,we've heard talks about quantum computing,and all these mysterious, far-off things.,But fundamentally, we still live in bodiesnthat are about this size,,we still walk about,nsit on chairs that are about this size,,we still live in the physical world.,And being familiar with these conceptsnmeans we're not helpless.,And I think it's really importantnthat we're not helpless,,that society feels it can look at things,,because this isn'tnabout knowing all the answers.,It's about having the frameworknso you can ask the right questions.,And by playing with these fundamentalnlittle things in everyday life,,we gain the confidencento ask the right questions. 
 So, there's a bigger thing.,In answer to Nana's question,about what can you donwhen you know that --,because there's lots of stuffnin the everyday world,that you can do when you know that,,especially if you've gotneggs in the fridge --,there's a much deeper answer.,And so there's all the funnand the curiosity,that you could have playing with toys.,By the way -- why should kids havenall the fun, right?,All of us can have fun playing with toys,,and we shouldn't be embarrassed about it.,You can blame me, it's fine. 
 So when it comes to reasonsnfor studying physics, for example,,here is the best reason I can think of:,I think that each of us hasnthree life-support systems.,We've got our own body, we've got a planet,and we've got our civilization.,Each of those is an independentnlife-support system,,keeping us alive in its own way.,And they all runnon the fundamental physical laws,that you can learn in the kitchennwith eggs and teacups and lemonade,,and everything else you can play with.,This is the reason, for example,,why something like climate changenis such a serious problem,,because It's two of thesenlife-support systems,,our planet and our civilization,,kind of butting up against each other;,they're in conflict,nand we need to negotiate that boundary. 
 And the fundamental physical lawsnthat we can learn,that are the waynthe world around us works,,are the tools at the basis of everything;,they're the foundation.,There's lots of thingsnto know about in life,,but knowing the foundationsnis going to get you a long way.,And I think this, if you're not interestednin having fun with physics,or anything like that -- strange,nbut apparently, these people exist --,you surely are interestednin keeping yourself alive,and in how our life-support systems work.,The framework for physicsnis remarkably constant;,it's the same in lots and lotsnof things that we measure.,It's not going to change anytime soon.,They might discovernsome new quantum mechanics,,but apples right herenare still going to fall down. 
 So, the question is --,I get asked sometimes: How do you start?,What's the place to start,if you're interested in the physicalnworld, in not being helpless,,and in finding some toys to play with?,Here is my suggestion to you:,the place to start is that moment --nand adults do this --,you're drifting along somewhere,,and you spot somethingnand your brain goes, "Oh, that's weird.",And then your consciousness goes,n"You're an adult. Keep going.",And that's the point --nhold that thought --,that bit where your brain went,n"Oh, that's a bit odd,",because there's somethingnthere to play with,,and it's worth you playing with it,,so that's the place to start. 
 But if you don't havenany of those little moments,on your way home from this event,,here are some things to start with.,Put raisins in [fizzy] lemonade;nhighly entertaining.,Watch a coffee spill dry.,I know that sounds a little bitnlike watching paint dry,,but it does do quite weird things;nit's worth watching.,I'm an acquired taste at dinner partiesnif there are teacups around.,There are so many things you can donto play with teacups, it's brilliant.,The most obvious onenis to get a teacup, get a spoon,,tap the teacup around the rim and listen,,and you will hear something strange.,And the other thing is,npush your toast off the table,because you can,nand you'll learn stuff from it.,And if you're feeling really ambitious,,try and push it off in such a waynthat it doesn't fall butter-side down,,which is possible. 
 The point of all of this is that,,first of all, we should allnplay with toys.,We shouldn't be afraid to investigatenthe physical world for ourselves,with the tools around us,,because we all have access to them.,It matters, because if we wantnto understand society,,if we want to be good citizens,,we need to understand the frameworknon which everything else must be based. 
 Playing with toys is great.,Understanding how to keepnour life-support systems going is great.,But fundamentally, the thingnthat we need to change,in the way that we talk about physics,,is we need to understand,that physics isn't out therenwith weird people,and strange hieroglyphics,for somebody else in a posh lab.,Physics is right here; it's for us,nand we can all play with it. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Chris Anderson: Welcomento this next edition of TED Dialogues.,We're trying to donsome bridging here today.,You know, the American dreamnhas inspired millions of people,around the world for many years.,Today, I think, you can saynthat America is divided,,perhaps more than ever,,and the divisions seemnto be getting worse.,It's actually really hardnfor people on different sides,to even have a conversation.,People almost feel...,disgusted with each other.,Some families can't even speaknto each other right now.,Our purpose in this dialogue todaynis to try to do something about that,,to try to have a different kindnof conversation,,to do some listening, some thinking,nsome understanding.,And I have two people with usnto help us do that. 
 They're not going to come at thisnhammer and tong against each other.,This is not like cable news.,This is two people who have both spentna lot of their working life,in the political centernor right of the center.,They've immersed themselvesnin conservative worldviews, if you like.,They know that space very well.,And we're going to explore together,how to think aboutnwhat is happening right now,,and whether we can find new ways to bridge,and just to have wiser,nmore connected conversations. 
 With me, first of all, Gretchen Carlson,,who has spent a decadenworking at Fox News,,hosting "Fox and Friends"nand then "The Real Story,",before taking a courageous stancenin filing sexual harassment claims,against Roger Ailes,,which eventually lednto his departure from Fox News.,David Brooks, who has earned the wrath,of many of [The New York Times's]nleft-leaning readers,because of his conservative views,,and more recently, perhaps,nsome of the right-leaning readers,because of his criticismnof some aspects of Trump.,Yet, his columns are usually,the top one, two or threenmost-read content of the day,because they're brilliant,,because they bring psychologynand social science,to providing understandingnfor what's going on.,So without further ado, a huge welcomento Gretchen and David.,Come and join me. 
 (Applause) 
 So, Gretchen.,Sixty-three million Americansnvoted for Donald Trump.,Why did they do this? 
 Gretchen Carlson: There are a lotnof reasons, in my mind, why it happened.,I mean, I think it was a movementnof sorts, but it started long ago.,It didn't just happen overnight.,"Anger" would be the first wordnthat I would think of --,anger with nothingnbeing done in Washington,,anger about not being heard.,I think there was a huge swathnof the population,that feels like Washingtonnnever listens to them,,you know, a good part of the middlenof America, not just the coasts,,and he was somebody they feltnwas listening to their concerns.,So I think those two issuesnwould be the main reason.,I have to throw in there also celebrity.,I think that had a huge impactnon Donald Trump becoming president. 
 CA: Was the anger justified? 
 David Brooks: Yeah, I think so.,In 2015 and early 2016,nI wrote about 30 columns,with the following theme:,don't worry, Donald Trump will nevernbe the Republican nominee. 
 (Laughter) 
 And having done thatnand gotten that so wrong,,I decided to spend the ensuing yearnjust out in Trumpworld,,and I found a lot of economic dislocation.,I ran into a woman in West Virginianwho was going to a funeral for her mom.,She said, "The nice thing aboutnbeing Catholic is we don't have to speak,,and that's good,nbecause we're not word people.",That phrase rung in my head: word people.,A lot of us in the TED communitynare word people,,but if you're not, the economynhas not been angled toward you,,and so 11 million men, for example,nare out of the labor force,because those jobs are done away.,A lot of social injury.,You used to be able to say,n"I'm not the richest person in the world,,I'm not the most famous,,but my neighbors can count on menand I get some dignity out of that.",And because of celebritificationnor whatever, if you're not rich or famous,,you feel invisible.,And a lot of moral injury,nsense of feeling betrayed,,and frankly, in this country,nwe almost have one success story,,which is you go to college, getna white-collar job, and you're a success,,and if you don't fit in that formula,,you feel like you're not respected.,And so that accumulation of things --,and when I talked to Trumpnvoters and still do,,I found most of them completelynrealistic about his failings,,but they said, this is my shot. 
 GC: And yet I predictednthat he would be the nominee,,because I've known him for 27 years.,He's a master marketer,,and one of the thingsnhe did extremely well,that President Obama also didnextremely well,,was simplifying the message,,simplifying down to phrases,and to a populist message.,Even if he can't achieve it,nit sounded good.,And many people latched onnto that simplicity again.,It's something they could grasp onto:,"I get that. I want that.nThat sounds fantastic.",And I remember when he used to comenon my show originally,,before "The Apprentice"nwas even "The Apprentice,",and he'd say it was the numbernone show on TV.,I'd say back to him, "No, it's not.",And he would say, "Yes it is, Gretchen.",And I would say, "No it's not.",But people at home would see that,nand they'd be like,,"Wow, I should be watchingnthe number one show on TV.",And -- lo and behold -- it becamenthe number one show on TV.,So he had this, I've seennthis ability in him,to be the master marketer. 
 CA: It's puzzlingnto a lot of people on the left,that so many women voted for him,,despite some of his comments. 
 GC: I wrote a columnnabout this for Time Motto,,saying that I really believenthat lot of people put on blinders,,and maybe for the first time,,some people decidednthat policies they believed in,and being heardnand not being invisible anymore,was more important to them,than the way in which he had actednor acts as a human.,And so human dignity --,whether it would be the dust-upnabout the disabled reporter,,or what happenednin that audiotape with Billy Bush,and the way in which he spokenabout women --,they put that aside,and pretended as ifnthey hadn't seen that or heard that,,because to them,npolicies were more important. 
 CA: Right, so just becausensomeone voted for Trump,,it's not blind adherence to everythingnthat he's said or stood for. 
 GC: No. I heard a lot of peoplenthat would say to me,,"Wow, I just wish he would shut upnbefore the election.,If he would just stay quiet,nhe'd get elected." 
 CA: And so, maybe for people on the leftnthere's a trap there,,to sort of despisenor just be baffled by the support,,assuming that it's for somenof the unattractive features.,Actually, maybe they're supportingnhim despite those,,because they see something exciting.,They see a man of action.,They see the choking hold of governmentnbeing thrown off in some way,and they're excited by that. 
 GC: But don't forget we saw thatnon the left as well -- Bernie Sanders.,So this is one of the commonalitiesnthat I think we can talk about today,,"The Year of the Outsider,"nDavid -- right?,And even though Bernie Sandersnhas been in Congress for a long time,,he was deemed an outsider this time.,And so there was angernon the left as well,,and so many people were in favornof Bernie Sanders.,So I see it as a commonality.,People who like Trump,npeople who like Bernie Sanders,,they were liking different policies,nbut the underpinning was anger. 
 CA: David, there's oftennthis narrative, then,,that the sole explanationnfor Trump's victory and his rise,is his tapping into angernin a very visceral way.,But you've written a bit aboutnthat it's actually more than that,,that there's a worldviewnthat's being worked on here.,Could you talk about that? 
 DB: I would say he understood what,nfrankly, I didn't,,which is what debate we were having.,And so I'd grown up starting with Reagan,,and it was the big governmentnversus small government debate.,It was Barry Goldwaternversus George McGovern,,and that was the debatenwe had been having for a generation.,It was: Democrats wanted to usengovernment to enhance equality,,Republicans wanted to limit governmentnto enhance freedom.,That was the debate.,He understood what I thinknthe two major parties did not,,which was that's not the debate anymore.,The debate is now open versus closed.,On one side are those who haventhe tailwinds of globalization,and the meritocracy blowing at their back,,and they tend to favor open trade,,open borders, open social mores,,because there are so many opportunities.,On the other side are thosenwho feel the headwinds of globalization,and the meritocracynjust blasting in their faces,,and they favor closed trade,nclosed borders, closed social mores,,because they just want some security.,And so he was rightnon that fundamental issue,,and people were willingnto overlook a lot to get there.,And so he felt that sense of security. 
 We're speaking the morning afternTrump's joint session speech.,There are three traditionalngroups in the Republican Party.,There are the foreign policies hawks,who believe in Americanas global policeman.,Trump totally repudiated that view.,Second, there was the social conservatives,who believed in religious liberty,,pro-life,,prayer in schools.,He totally ignored that.,There was not a single mentionnof a single social conservative issue.,And then there were the fiscal hawks,,the people who wanted to cut downnon the national debt, Tea Party,,cut the size of government.,He's expanding the size of government!,Here's a man who has single-handedlynrevolutionized a major American party,because he understoodnwhere the debate was headed,before other people.,And then guys like Steve Bannon come in,and give him substance to his impulses. 
 CA: And so take that a bit further,,and maybe expand a bit morenon your insights,into Steve Bannon's worldview.,Because he's sometimes tarrednin very simple terms,as this dangerous, racist,nxenophobic, anger-sparking person.,There's more to the story;nthat is perhaps an unfair simplification. 
 DB: I think that part is true,,but there's another partnthat's probably true, too.,He's part of a global movement.,It's like being around Marxists in 1917.,There's him here, there's the UKIP party,nthere's the National Front in France,,there's Putin, there's a Turkish version,na Philippine version.,So we have to recognize that thisnis a global intellectual movement.,And it believes,that wisdom and virtue is not heldnin individual conversation and civility,the way a lot of usnin the enlightenment side of the world do.,It's held in -- the German wordnis the "volk" -- in the people,,in the common, instinctive wisdomnof the plain people.,And the essential virtue of that peoplenis always being threatened by outsiders.,And he's got a strategynfor how to get there.,He's got a series of policiesnto bring the people up,and repudiate the outsiders,,whether those outsidersnare Islam, Mexicans, the media,,the coastal elites...,And there's a whole worldview there;nit's a very coherent worldview.,I sort of have more respect for him.,I loathe what he stands fornand I think he's wrong on the substance,,but it's interesting to see someonenwith a set of ideas,find a vehicle, Donald Trump,,and then try to take controlnof the White House,in order to advance his viewpoint. 
 CA: So it's almost become, like,nthat the core question of our time now is:,Can you be patrioticnbut also have a global mindset?,Are these two thingsnimplacably opposed to each other?,I mean, a lot of conservatives,and, to the extentnthat it's a different category,,a lot of Trump supporters,,are infuriated by the coastal elitesnand the globalists,because they see themnas, sort of, not cheering for America,,not embracing fully American values.,I mean, have you seen thatnin your conversations with people,,in your understanding of their mindset? 
 GC: I do think that there'sna huge difference between --,I hate to put people in categories, but,,Middle America versusnpeople who live on the coasts.,It's an entirely different existence.,And I grew up in Minnesota, so I havenan understanding of Middle America,,and I've never forgotten it.,And maybe that's why I havenan understanding of what happened here,,because those people often feelnlike nobody's listening to them,,and that we're only concentratingnon California and New York.,And so I think that was a huge reasonnwhy Trump was elected.,I mean, these people felt likenthey were being heard.,Whether or not patriotism falls into that,,I'm not sure about that.,I do know one thing:,a lot of things Trump talked aboutnlast night are not conservative things.,Had Hillary Clinton gotten upnand given that speech,,not one Republican would havenstood up to applaud.,I mean, he's talking about spendingna trillion dollars on infrastructure.,That is not a conservative viewpoint.,He talked about government-mandatednmaternity leave.,A lot of women may love that;nit's not a conservative viewpoint.,So it's fascinating,that people who loved what his messagenwas during the campaign,,I'm not sure -- how do younthink they'll react to that? 
 DB: I should say I grew upnin Lower Manhattan,,in the triangle between ABC Carpets,nthe Strand Bookstore,and The Odeon restaurant. 
 (Laughter) 
 GC: Come to Minnesota sometime! 
 (Laughter) 
 CA: You are a card-carrying membernof the coastal elite, my man.,But what did you makenof the speech last night?,It seemed to be a movento a more moderate position,,on the face of it. 
 DB: Yeah, I thought itnwas his best speech,,and it took away the freakishness of him.,I do think he's a moral freak,,and I think he'll be undone by that fact,,the fact that he just doesn't knownanything about anything,and is uncurious about it. 
 (Laughter) 
 But if you take away these minor flaws,,I think we got to see him at his best,,and it was revealing for mento see him at his best,,because to me, it exposed a centralncontradiction that he's got to confront,,that a lot of what he's doingnis offering security.,So, "I'm ordering closed borders,,I'm going to secure the worldnfor you, for my people.",But then if you actually looknat a lot of his economic policies,,like health care reform, which is aboutnprivate health care accounts,,that's not security, that's risk.,Educational vouchers: that's risk.nDeregulation: that's risk.,There's really a contradictionnbetween the security of the mindset,and a lot of the policies,nwhich are very risk-oriented.,And what I would say, especiallynhaving spent this year,,the people in rural Minnesota,nin New Mexico --,they've got enough risk in their lives.,And so they're going to say,n"No thank you.",And I think his health care repealnwill fail for that reason. 
 CA: But despite the criticismsnyou just made of him,,it does at least seem that he's listening,to a surprisingly wide range of voices;,it's not like everyonenis coming from the same place.,And maybe that leads to a certainnamount of chaos and confusion, but -- 
 GC: I actually don't think he's listeningnto a wide range of voices.,I think he's listening to very few people.,That's just my impression of it.,I believe that some of the thingsnhe said last night,had Ivanka all over them.,So I believe he was listeningnto her before that speech.,And he was Teleprompter Trumpnlast night, as opposed to Twitter Trump.,And that's why, before we came out here,,I said, "We better check Twitternto see if anything's changed.",And also I think you have to keep in mind,that because he's such a unique character,,what was the bar that wenwere expecting last night?,Was it here or here or here?,And so he comes outnand gives a looking political speech,,and everyone goes, "Wow! He can do it.",It just dependsnon which direction he goes. 
 DB: Yeah, and we're tryingnto build bridges here,,and especially for an audiencenthat may have contempt for Trump,,it's important to say,nno, this is a real thing.,But as I try my best to go an hournshowing respect for him,,my thyroid is surging,,because I think the odditiesnof his character,really are condemnatorynand are going to doom him. 
 CA: Your reputation is as a conservative.,People would you describe younas right of center,,and yet here you arenwith this visceral reaction against him,and some of what he stands for.,I mean, I'm -- how do you havena conversation?,The people who support him,non evidence so far,,are probably pretty excited.,He's certainly shown real engagement,in a lot of what he promised to do,,and there is a strong desirento change the system radically.,People hate what government has becomenand how it's left them out. 
 GC: I totally agree with that,,but I think that when he was proposingna huge government program last night,that we used to call the bad s-word,n"stimulus," I find it completely ironic.,To spend a trillion dollarsnon something --,that is not a conservative viewpoint.,Then again, I don't really believenhe's a Republican. 
 DB: And I would say, as someonenwho identifies as conservative:,first of all,,to be conservative is to believenin the limitations of politics.,Samuel Johnson said, "Of all the thingsnthat human hearts endure,,how few are those that kingsncan cause and cure.",Politics is a limited realm;,what matters mostnis the moral nature of the society.,And so I have to thinkncharacter comes first,,and a man who doesn't passnthe character threshold,cannot be a good president.,Second, I'm the kindnof conservative who --,I harken back to Alexander Hamilton,,who was a Latino hip-hop starnfrom the heights -- 
 (Laughter) 
 but his definition of Americanwas very future-oriented.,He was a poor boy from the islands,who had this rapid and amazingnrise to success,,and he wanted government to givenpoor boys and girls like him,a chance to succeed,,using limited but energetic governmentnto create social mobility.,For him and for Lincolnnand for Teddy Roosevelt,,the idea of Americanwas the idea of the future.,We may have division and racismnand slavery in our past,,but we have a common future.,The definition of America that StevenBannon stands for is backwards-looking.,It's nostalgic; it's for the past.,And that is not traditionallynthe American identity.,That's traditionally, frankly,nthe Russian identity.,That's how they define virtue.,And so I think it is a fundamentalnand foundational betrayal,of what conservatism used to stand for. 
 CA: Well, I'd like actuallynlike to hear from you,,and if we see some comments coming innfrom some of you, we'll --,oh, well here's one right now.,Jeffrey Alan Carnegie: I've triednto convince progressive friends,that they need to understandnwhat motivates Trump supporters,,yet many of them have given upntrying to understand,in the face of what they perceivenas lies, selfishness and hatred.,How would you reach out to such people,nthe Tea Party of the left,,to try to bridge this divide? 
 GC: I actually thinknthere are commonalities in anger,,as I expressed earlier.,So I think you can come to the table,nboth being passionate about something.,So at least you care.,And I would like to believe --nthe c-word has also become,a horrible word -- "compromise," right?,So you have the far leftnand the far right,,and compromise -- forget it.,Those groups don't wantnto even think about it.,But you have a huge swathnof voters, myself included,,who are registered independents,,like 40 percent of us, right?,So there is a huge faction of Americanthat wants to see change,and wants to see people come together.,It's just that we have to figure out,how to do that. 
 CA: So let's talk about that for a minute,,because we're having these TED Dialogues,nwe're trying to bridge.,There's a lot of people out there,nright now, perhaps especially on the left,,who think this is a terrible idea,,that actually, the only moral responsento the great tyranny,that may be about to emerge in America,is to resist it at every stage,nis to fight it tooth and nail,,it's a mistake to try and do this.,Just fight!,Is there a case for that? 
 DB: It depends what "fight" means.nIf it means literal fighting, then no.,If it means marching, well maybenmarching to raise consciousness,,that seems fine.,But if you want change in this country,nwe do it through parties and politics.,We organize parties, and those partiesnare big, diverse, messy coalitions,,and we engage in politics,,and politics is alwaysnmorally unsatisfying,because it's alwaysna bunch of compromises.,But politics is essentiallyna competition between partial truths.,The Trump people have a piecenof the truth in America.,I think Trump himself is the wrong answernto the right question,,but they have some truth,,and it's truth found in the epidemicnof opiates around the country,,it's truth found innthe spread of loneliness,,it's the truth found in peoplenwhose lives are inverted.,They peaked professionally at age 30,,and it's all been downhill since.,And so, understanding thatndoesn't take fighting,,it takes conversation and then asking,,"What are we going to replace Trump with?" 
 GC: But you saw fighting last night,neven at the speech,,because you saw the Democratic womennwho came and wore white,to honor the suffragette movement.,I remember back during the campaign,where some Trump supporters wantednto actually get rid of the amendment,that allowed us to vote as women.,It was like, what?,So I don't know ifnthat's the right way to fight.,It was interesting,nbecause I was looking in the audience,,trying to see Democratic womennwho didn't wear white.,So there's a lot going on there,,and there's a lot of ways to fightnthat are not necessarily doing that. 
 CA: I mean, one of the keynquestions, to me, is:,The people who voted for Trumpnbut, if you like, are more in the center,,like they're possiblynamenable to persuasion --,are they more likely to be persuadednby seeing a passionate uprising,of people saying, "No, no, no, you can't!",or will that actually piss them offnand push them away? 
 DB: How are any of us persuaded?,Am I going to persuade you by saying,n"Well, you're kind of a bigot,,you're supporting bigotry,nyou're supporting sexism.,You're a primitive, fascistic risenfrom some authoritarian past"?,That's probably not going to bentoo persuasive to you.,And so the way any of usnare persuaded is by:,a) some basic show of respectnfor the point of view, and saying,,"I think this guy is not goingnto get you where you need to go.",And there are two phrasesnyou've heard over and over again,,wherever you go in the country.,One, the phrase "flyover country.",And that's been heard for years,,but I would say this year,nI heard it almost on an hourly basis,,a sense of feeling invisible.,And then the sense a sense of the phrasen"political correctness.",Just that rebellion: "They're not evennletting us say what we think.",And I teach at Yale.,The narrowing of debate is real. 
 CA: So you would say this is a trapnthat liberals have fallen into,by celebrating causesnthey really believe in,,often expressed through the languagenof "political correctness.",They have done damage.nThey have pushed people away. 
 DB: I would sayna lot of the argument, though,,with "descent to fascism,"n"authoritarianism" --,that just feels over-the-top to people.,And listen, I've writtenneight million anti-Trump columns,,but it is a problem, especiallynfor the coastal media,,that every time he does somethingnslightly wrong, we go to 11,,and we're at 11 every day.,And it just strainsncredibility at some point. 
 CA: Crying wolf a little too loudnand a little too early.,But there may be a timenwhen we really do have to cry wolf. 
 GC: But see -- one of the mostnimportant things to me,is how the conservative medianhandles Trump.,Will they call him outnwhen things are not true,,or will they just go along with it?,To me, that is what is essentialnin this entire discussion,,because when you havenfollowers of somebody,who don't really carenif he tells the truth or not,,that can be very dangerous.,So to me, it's: How is the conservativenmedia going to respond to it?,I mean, you've been calling them out.,But how will other formsnof conservative media deal with that,as we move forward? 
 DB: It's all shifted, though.,The conservative media used to be Foxnor Charles Krauthammer or George Will.,They're no longer the conservative media.,Now there's another whole setnof institutions further right,,which is Breitbart and Infowars,nAlex Jones, Laura Ingraham,,and so they're the ones who are nownhis base, not even so much Fox. 
 CA: My last question for the time beingnis just on this question of the truth.,I mean, it's one of the scariestnthings to people right now,,that there is no agreement,nnationally, on what is true.,I've never seen anything like it,,where facts are so massively disputed.,Your whole newspaper, sir,nis delivering fake news every day. 
 DB: And failing. 
 (Laughter) 
 CA: And failing. My commiserations.,But is there any path,whereby we can start to getnsome kind of consensus,,to believe the same things?,Can online communities play a role here?,How do we fix this? 
 GC: See, I understand how that happened.,That's another groundswell kind of emotion,that was going on in the middle of America,and not being heard,,in thinking that the mainstreamnmedia was biased.,There's a difference, though,nbetween being biased and being fake.,To me, that is a very importantndistinction in this conversation.,So let's just say that there was some biasnin the mainstream media.,OK. So there are waysnto try and mend that.,But what Trump's doingnis nuclearizing that and saying,,"Look, we're just going to callnall of that fake.",That's where it gets dangerous. 
 CA: Do you think enough of his supporters,have a greater loyaltynto the truth than to any ...,Like, the principlenof not supporting something,that is demonstrably not true,actually matters, so there will bena correction at some point? 
 DB: I think the truthneventually comes out.,So for example, Donald Trumpnhas based a lot of his economic policy,on this supposition that Americansnhave lost manufacturing jobs,because they've been stolennby the Chinese.,That is maybe 13 percentnof the jobs that left.,The truth is that 87 percent of the jobsnwere replaced by technology.,That is just the truth.,And so as a result, when he says,,"I'm going to close TPPnand all the jobs will come roaring back,",they will not come roaring back.,So that is an actual fact, in my belief.,And -- 
 (Laughter) 
 GC: But I'm saying whatnhis supporters think is the truth,,no matter how many timesnyou might say that,,they still believe him. 
 DB: But eventually either jobsnwill come back or they will not come back,,and at that point, either somethingnwill work or it doesn't work,,and it doesn't work or not worknbecause of great marketing,,it works because it actuallynaddresses a real problem,and so I happen to thinknthe truth will out. 
 CA: If you've got a question,nplease raise your hand here. 
 Yael Eisenstat: I'll speak into the box.,My name's Yael Eisenstat.,I hear a lot of this talk,about how we all need to startntalking to each other more,and understanding each other more,,and I've even written about this,npublished on this subject as well,,but now today I keep hearing liberals --nyes, I live in New York,,I can be considered a liberal --,we sit here and self-analyze:,What did we do to not understandnthe Rust Belt?,Or: What can we do to understandnMiddle America better?,And what I'd like to know:,Have you seen any attemptsnor conversations from Middle America,of what can I do to understandnthe so-called coastal elites better?,Because I'm just offendednas being put in a box as a coastal elite,as someone in Middle America isnas being considered a flyover state,and not listened to. 
 CA: There you go, I can hear Facebookncheering as you -- 
 (Laughter) 
 DB: I would say -- and this is someonenwho has been conservative,all my adult life --,when you grow up conservative,,you learn to speak both languages.,Because if I'm going to listen to music,,I'm not going to listen to Ted Nugent.,So a lot of my favorite rock bandsnare all on the left.,If I'm going to go to a school,,I'm going probably to schoolnwhere the culture is liberal.,If I'm going to watch a sitcom,or a late-night comedy show,nit's going to be liberal.,If I'm going to read a good newspaper,nit'll be the New York Times.,As a result, you learnnto speak both languages.,And that actually, at leastnfor a number of years,,when I started at National Reviewnwith William F. Buckley,,it made us sharper,,because we were used to arguingnagainst people every day.,The problem now that's happenednis you have ghettoization on the right,and you can live entirely in rightworld,,so as a result, the quality of argumentnon the right has diminished,,because you're not in the other side,all the time.,But I do think if you're livingnin Minnesota or Iowa or Arizona,,the coastal elitesnmake themselves aware to you,,so you know that language as well,,but it's not the reverse. 
 CA: But what does Middle Americannot get about coastal elites?,So the critique is,,you are not dealingnwith the real problems.,There's a feeling of a snobbishness,nan elitism that is very off-putting.,What are they missing?,If you could plant one piece of truth,from the mindset of someonenin this room, for example,,what would you say to them? 
 DB: Just how insanely wonderful we are. 
 (Laughter) 
 No, I reject the category.,The problem with populismnis the same problem with elitism.,It's just a prejudice on the basis,of probably an over-generalized nsocial class distinction,which is too simplisticnto apply in reality.,Those of us in New York knownthere are some people in New York,who are completely awesome,nand some people who are pathetic,,and if you live in Iowa, some peoplenare awesome and some people are pathetic.,It's not a questionnof what degree you have,or where you happen to livenin the country.,The distinction is just a crudensimplification to arouse political power. 
 GC: But I would encourage peoplento watch a television news show,or read a columnnthat they normally wouldn't.,So if you are a Trump supporter,nwatch the other side for a day,,because you need to come out of the bubble,if you're ever goingnto have a conversation.,And both sides -- so if you're a liberal,,then watch somethingnthat's very conservative.,Read a column that is not somethingnyou would normally read,,because then you gain perspectivenof what the other side is thinking,,and to me, that's a startnof coming together.,I worry about the same thingnyou worry about, these bubbles.,I think if you only watchncertain entities,,you have no idea what the restnof the world is talking about. 
 DB: I think not only watching,,being part of an organizationnthat meets at least once a month,that puts you in direct contactnwith people completely unlike yourself,is something we all havena responsibility for.,I may get this a little wrong,,but I think of the top-sellingnautomotive models in this country,,I think the top three or fournare all pickup trucks.,So ask yourself: How many peoplendo I know who own a pickup truck?,And it could be very few or zeronfor a lot of people.,And that's sort of a warning signnkind of a problem.,Where can I join a club,where I'll have a lot in commonnwith a person who drives a pickup truck,because we have a commonninterest in whatever? 
 CA: And so the internet is definitelyncontributing to this.,A question here from Chris Ajemian:,"How do you feel structurenof communications,,especially the prevalence of socialnmedia and individualized content,,can be used to bring togetherna political divide,,instead of just filing communitiesninto echo chambers?",I mean, it looks like Facebooknand Google, since the election,,are working hard on this question.,They're trying to change the algorithms,so that they don't amplify fake news,to the extent that it happenednlast time round.,Do you see any othernpromising signs of ...? 
 GC: ... or amplify one sidenof the equation. 
 CA: Exactly. 
 GC: I think that was the constantnargument from the right,,that social medianand the internet in general,was putting articles towards the topnthat were not their worldview.,I think, again, that fed into the anger.,It fed into the anger of:,"You're pushing somethingnthat's not what I believe.",But social media has obviouslynchanged everything,,and I think Trump is the examplenof Twitter changing absolutely everything.,And from his point of view,,he's reaching the American peoplenwithout a filter,,which he believes the media is. 
 CA: Question from the audience. 
 Destiny: Hi. I'm Destiny.,I have a question regarding politicalncorrectness, and I'm curious:,When did political correctnessnbecome synonymous with silencing,,versus a way that we speaknabout other people,to show them respectnand preserve their dignity? 
 GC: Well, I think the conservative medianreally pounded this issue,for the last 10 years.,I think that they really, reallynspent a lot of time,talking about political correctness,,and how people should haventhe ability to say what they think.,Another reason why Trumpnbecame so popular:,because he says what he thinks.,It also makes me think about the fact,that I do believe there are a lotnof people in America,who agree with Steve Bannon,,but they would never say it publicly,,and so voting for Trumpngave them the opportunity,to agree with it silently. 
 DB: On the issue of immigration,nit's a legitimate point of view,that we have too many immigrantsnin the country,,that it's economically costly. 
 CA: That we have too many -- 
 DB: Immigrants in the country,nespecially from Britain. 
 (Laughter) 
 GC: I kind of like the British accent, OK? 
 CA: I apologize. America, I am sorry. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'll go now. 
 DB: But it becamensort of impermissible to say that,,because it was a sign that somehownyou must be a bigot of some sort.,So the political correctnessnwas not only cracking down on speech,that we would all findncompletely offensive,,it was cracking down on some speechnthat was legitimate,,and then it was turning speechnand thought into action,and treating it as a crime,,and people getting firednand people thrown out of schools,,and there were speech codes written.,Now there are these diversity teams,,where if you say somethingnthat somebody finds offensive,,like, "Smoking is really dangerous,"nyou can say "You're insulting my group,",and the team from the administrationnwill come down into your dorm room,and put thought police upon you.,And so there has been a genuine narrowingnof what is permissible to say.,And some of it is legitimate.,There are certain words that therenshould be some social sanction against,,but some of it was usednto enforce a political agenda. 
 CA: So is that a project,you would urge on liberals,nif you like -- progressives --,to rethink the ground rulesnaround political correctness,and accept a little morenuncomfortable language,in certain circumstances?,Can you see that being solved,to an extent that othersnwon't be so offended? 
 DB: I mean, most American universities,nespecially elite universities,,are overwhelmingly on the left,,and there's just an ease of temptation,to use your overwhelming cultural powernto try to enforce some sort of thought,that you think is rightnand correct thought.,So, be a little more self-suspiciousnof, are we doing that?,And second, my university,nthe University of Chicago,,sent out this letter saying,nwe will have no safe spaces.,There will be no critiquenof micro-aggression.,If you get your feelings hurt,nwell, welcome to the world of education.,I do think that policy --,which is being embraced by a lotnof people on the left, by the way --,is just a corrective to what's happened. 
 CA: So here's a questionnfrom Karen Holloway:,How do we foster an American culture,that's forward-looking, like Hamilton,,that expects and deals with change,,rather than wanting to have everythingngo back to some fictional past?,That's an easy question, right? 
 GC: Well, I'm still a believernin the American dream,,and I think what we can teachnour children is the basics,,which is that hard work,and believing in yourself,in America, you can achievenwhatever you want.,I was told that every single day.,When I got in the real world, I was like,nwow, that's maybe not always so true.,But I still believe in that.,Maybe I'm being too optimistic.,So I still look towards the futurenfor that to continue. 
 DB: I think you're being too optimistic. 
 GC: You do? 
 DB: The odds of an American young personnexceeding their parents' salary --,a generation ago, like 86 percent did it.,Now 51 percent do it.,There's just been a problemnin social mobility in the country. 
 CA: You've written that this entirencentury has basically been a disaster,,that the age of sunny growth is overnand we're in deep trouble. 
 DB: Yeah, I mean, we averaged,nin real terms, population-adjusted,,two or three percent growth for 50 years,,and now we've had lessnthan one percent growth.,And so there's something seeping out.,And so if I'm going to tell peoplenthat they should take risks,,one of the things we're seeingnis a rapid decline in mobility,,the number of people who are movingnacross state lines,,and that's especially truenamong millennials.,It's young people that are moving less.,So how do we give people the securitynfrom which they can take risk?,And I'm a big believer in attachmentntheory of raising children,,and attachment theorynis based on the motto,that all of life is a seriesnof daring adventures from a secure base.,Have you parents given you a secure base?,And as a society,nwe do not have a secure base,,and we won't get to that "Hamilton,"nrisk-taking, energetic ethos,until we can supply a secure base. 
 CA: So I wonder whethernthere's ground here,to create almost like a shared agenda,na bridging conversation,,on the one hand recognizingnthat there is this really deep problem,that the system,nthe economic system that we built,,seems to be misfiring right now.,Second, that maybe, if you're rightnthat it's not all about immigrants,,it's probably more about technology,,if you could win that argument,,that de-emphasizes what seems to menthe single most divisive territory,between Trump supporters and others,nwhich is around the role of the other.,It's very offensive to people on the leftnto have the other demonized,to the extent that the othernseems to be demonized.,That feels deeply immoral,,and maybe people on the leftncould agree, as you said,,that immigrationnmay have happened too fast,,and there is a limit beyond whichnhuman societies struggle,,but nonetheless this whole problemnbecomes de-emphasized,if automation is the key issue,,and then we try to work togethernon recognizing that it's real,,recognizing that the problemnprobably wasn't properly addressed,or seen or heard,,and try to figure outnhow to rebuild communities,using, well, using what?,That seems to me to becomenthe fertile conversation of the future:,How do we rebuild communitiesnin this modern age,,with technology doing what it's doing,,and reimagine this bright future? 
 GC: That's why I go back to optimism.,I'm not being ... it's not likenI'm not looking at the facts,,where we've come or where we've come from.,But for gosh sakes, if we don't looknat it from an optimistic point of view --,I'm refusing to do that just yet.,I'm not raising my 12- and 13-year-oldnto say, "Look, the world is dim." 
 CA; We're going to havenone more question from the room here. 
 Questioner: Hi. Hello. Sorry.,You both mentionednthe infrastructure plan and Russia,and some other things that wouldn't bentraditional Republican priorities.,What do you think, or when,nwill Republicans be motivated,to take a stand against Trumpism? 
 GC: After last night, not for a while.,He changed a lot last night, I believe. 
 DB: His popularity among Republicans --nhe's got 85 percent approval,,which is higher than Reagannhad at this time,,and that's because societynhas just gotten more polarized.,So people follow the partynmuch more than they used to.,So if you're waiting for Paul Ryannand the Republicans in Congress,to flake away,,it's going to take a little while. 
 GC: But also because they're allnconcerned about reelection,,and Trump has so much powernwith getting people either for you,or against you,,and so, they're vacillatingnevery day, probably:,"Well, should I go againstnor should I not?",But last night, where he finallynsounded presidential,,I think most Republicans are breathingna sigh of relief today. 
 DB: The half-life of that is short. 
 GC: Right -- I was just going to say,nuntil Twitter happens again. 
 CA: OK, I want to giveneach of you the chance,to imagine you're speakingnto -- I don't know --,the people online who are watching this,,who may be Trump supporters,,who may be on the left,nsomewhere in the middle.,How would you advise them to bridgenor to relate to other people?,Can you share any final wisdom on this?,Or if you think that they shouldn't,ntell them that as well. 
 GC: I would just start by saying,that I really think any changenand coming together starts from the top,,just like any other organization.,And I would love if, somehow,,Trump supporters or people on the leftncould encourage their leaders,to show that compassion from the top,,because imagine the changenthat we could have,if Donald Trump tweeted out today,,to all of his supporters,,"Let's not be vile anymore to each other.,Let's have more understanding.,As a leader, I'm goingnto be more inclusive,to all of the people of America.",To me, it starts at the top.,Is he going to do that? I have no idea.,But I think that everythingnstarts from the top,,and the power that he has,in encouraging his supporters,to have an understanding of wherenpeople are coming from on the other side. 
 CA: David. DB: Yeah, I guess I would say,I don't think we can teachneach other to be civil,,and give us sermons on civility.,That's not going to do it.,It's substance and how we act,,and the nice thing about Donald Trumpnis he smashed our categories.,All the categories that we thoughtnwe were thinking in, they're obsolete.,They were great for the 20th century.nThey're not good for today.,He's got an agenda which is aboutnclosing borders and closing trade.,I just don't think it's going to work.,I think if we want to rebuildncommunities, recreate jobs,,we need a different set of agenda,that smashes through all our currentndivisions and our current categories.,For me, that agenda is Reaganismnon macroeconomic policy,,Sweden on welfare policy,and cuts across right and left.,I think we have to have a dynamicneconomy that creates growth.,That's the Reagan on economic policy.,But people have to have that secure base.,There have to bennurse-family partnerships;,there has to be universal preschool;,there have to be charter schools;,there have to be college programsnwith wraparound programs,for parents and communities.,We need to help heal the crisisnof social solidarity in this country,and help heal families,,and government just has to getna lot more involved,in the way liberals likento rebuild communities.,At the other hand, we have to havenan economy that's free and open,the way conservatives used to like.,And so getting the substance rightnis how you smash through,the partisan identities,,because the substance is whatnultimately shapes our polarization. 
 CA: David and Gretchen, thank you so much,for an absolutelynfascinating conversation.,Thank you. That was really,nreally interesting. 
 (Applause) 
 Hey, let's keep the conversation going.,We're continuing to try and figure out,whether we can add something here,,so keep the conversationngoing on Facebook.,Give us your thoughts from whatever partnof the political spectrum you're on,,and actually, wherevernin the world you are.,This is not just about America.nIt's about the world, too.,But we're not goingnto end today without music,,because if we put musicnin every political conversation,,the world would bencompletely different, frankly.,It just would. 
 (Applause) 
 Up in Harlem, this extraordinary woman,,Vy Higginsen, who's actually right here --,let's get a shot of her. 
 (Applause) 
 She created this programnthat brings teens together,,teaches them the joynand the impact of gospel music,,and hundreds of teens have gonenthrough this program.,It's transformative for them.,The music they made, as you already heard,,is extraordinary,,and I can't think of a better waynof ending this TED Dialogue,than welcoming Vy Higginsen'snGospel Choir from Harlem.,Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 (Singing) Choir: O beautifulnfor spacious skies,For amber waves of grain,For purple mountain majesties,Above the fruited plain,America!,America!,America!,America!,God shed his grace on thee,And crown thy good with brotherhood,From sea to shining sea,From sea to shining sea 
 (Applause)So 24 years ago,,I was brought to The New Yorker,as art editor,to rejuvenate,what had by then becomena somewhat staid institution,and to bring in new artists,and to try to bring the magazinenfrom its ivory tower,into engaging with its time.,And it was justnthe right thing for me to do,because I've always been captivatednby how an image can --,a simple drawing --,can cut through the torrent of imagesnthat we see every single day.,How it can capture a moment,,how it can crystallizena social trend or a complex event,in a way that a lot of wordsnwouldn't be able to do --,and reduce it to its essencenand turn it into a cartoon. 
 So I went to the library,and I looked at the first coverndrawn by Rea Irvin in 1925 --,a dandy looking at a butterflynthrough his monocle,,and we call it Eustace Tilley.,And I realized thatnas the magazine had become known,for its in-depth researchnand long reports,,some of the humornhad gotten lost along the way,,because now often Eustace Tilleynwas seen as a haughty dandy,,but in fact, in 1925,,when Rea Irvin first drew this image,,he did it as part of a humor magazine,to amuse the youth of the era,,which was the flappersnof the roaring twenties.,And in the library,,I found the imagesnthat really captured the zeitgeist,of the Great Depression.,And it showed usnnot just how people dressed,or what their cars looked like,,but also what made them laugh,,what their prejudices were.,And you really got a sense,of what it felt likento be alive in the '30s. 
 So I called on contemporary artists,,such as Adrian Tomine here.,I often call on narrative artists --,cartoonists, children's book authors --,and I give them themes such as,,you know, what it's likento be in the subway,,or Valentine's Day,,and they send me sketches.,And once the sketchesnare approved by the editor,,David Remnick,,it's a go.,And I love the way,those images are actuallynnot telling you what to think.,But they do make you think,,because the artist is actually --,it's almost a puzzle;,the artist is drawing the dots,,and you, the reader,nhave to complete the picture.,So to get this imagenon the left by Anita Kunz,,or the one on right by Tomer Hanuka,,you have to play spot the differences.,And it is something that ...,It's really exciting to see,how the engagement with the reader ...,how those images really capture --,play with the stereotypes.,But when you get it,,it rearranges the stereotypesnthat are in your head. 
 But the images don'tnjust have to show people,,sometimes it can be a feeling.,Right after September 11,,I was at a point,,like everybody else,,where I really didn't know how to dealnwith what we were going through,,and I felt that no imagencould capture this moment,,and I wanted to just do a black cover,,like no cover.,And I talked to my husband,ncartoonist Art Spiegelman,,and mentioned to himnthat I was going to propose that,,and he said, "Oh, if you'rengoing to do a black cover,,then why don't you donthe silhouette of the Twin Towers,,black on black?",And I sat down to draw this,,and as soon as I saw it,,a shiver ran down my spine,and I realized,that in this refusal to make an image,,we had found a way to capture loss,and mourning,and absence.,And it's been a profound thingnthat I learned in the process --,that sometimes some of the imagesnthat say the most,do it with the most spare means.,And a simple image can speak volumes. 
 So this is the imagenthat we published by Bob Staake,right after the election of Barack Obama,,and captured a historic moment.,But we can't really plan for this,,because in order to do this,,we have to let the artistnexperience the emotions that we all feel,when that is happening.,So back in November 2016,,during the election last year,,the only image that wencould publish was this,,which was on the standnon the week that everybody voted. 
 (Laughter) 
 Because we knewnsomebody would feel this -- 
 (Laughter) 
 when the result of the electionnwas announced.,And when we found out the result,,we really were at a loss,,and this is the imagenthat was sent by Bob Staake again,,and that really hit a chord.,And again,,we can't really figure outnwhat's going to come next,,but here it felt like we didn'tnknow how to move forward,,but we did move forward,,and this is the image that we publishednafter Donald Trump's election,and at the time of the Women's March,all over the US. 
 So over those 24 years,,I have seen over 1,000 imagesncome to life week after week,,and I'm often askednwhich one is my favorite,,but I can't pick one,because what I'm most proud ofnis how different every image is,,one from the other.,And that's due to the talentnand the diversity,of all of the artists that contribute. 
 And now, well,,now, we're owned by Russia,,so -- 
 (Laughter) 
 In a rendering by Barry Blitt here,,Eustace has becomenEustace Vladimirovich Tilley.,And the butterfly is none othernthan a flabbergasted Donald Trump,flapping his wings,,trying to figure outnhow to control the butterfly effect,,and the famed logonthat was drawn by Rae Irvin in 1925,is now in Cyrillic. 
 So, what makes me really excitednabout this moment,is the way that ...,You know, free pressnis essential to our democracy.,And we can see fromnthe sublime to the ridiculous,that artists can capture what is going on,in a way that an artist,armed with just India ink and watercolor,can capture and enterninto the cultural dialogue.,It puts those artistsnat the center of that culture,,and that's exactlynwhere I think they should be.,Because the main thing we neednright now is a good cartoon. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)This is what my last week looked like.,What I did,,who I was with,,the main sensations I hadnfor every waking hour ...,If the feeling came as I thought of my dad,who recently passed away,,or if I could have just definitelynavoided the worries and anxieties.,And if you think I'm a little obsessive,,you're probably right.,But clearly, from this visualization,,you can learn much more about menthan from this other one,,which are images you'renprobably more familiar with,and which you possibly even havenon your phone right now.,Bar charts for the steps you walked,,pie charts for the qualitynof your sleep --,the path of your morning runs. 
 In my day job, I work with data.,I run a data visualization design company,,and we design and develop waysnto make information accessible,through visual representations.,What my job has taught me over the years,is that to really understand datanand their true potential,,sometimes we actuallynhave to forget about them,and see through them instead.,Because data are alwaysnjust a tool we use to represent reality.,They're always usednas a placeholder for something else,,but they are never the real thing. 
 But let me step back for a moment,to when I first understoodnthis personally.,In 1994, I was 13 years old.,I was a teenager in Italy.,I was too youngnto be interested in politics,,but I knew that a businessman,nSilvio Berlusconi,,was running for presidentnfor the moderate right.,We lived in a very liberal town,,and my father was a politiciannfor the Democratic Party.,And I remember that no one thoughtnthat Berlusconi could get elected --,that was totally not an option.,But it happened.,And I remember the feeling very vividly.,It was a complete surprise,,as my dad promised that in my townnhe knew nobody who voted for him. 
 This was the first time,when the data I had gave mena completely distorted image of reality.,My data sample was actuallynpretty limited and skewed,,so probably it was because of that,nI thought, I lived in a bubble,,and I didn't have enough chancesnto see outside of it. 
 Now, fast-forward to November 8, 2016,in the United States.,The internet polls,,statistical models,,all the pundits agreeing on a possiblenoutcome for the presidential election.,It looked like we hadnenough information this time,,and many more chances to see outsidenthe closed circle we lived in --,but we clearly didn't.,The feeling felt very familiar.,I had been there before.,I think it's fair to saynthe data failed us this time --,and pretty spectacularly.,We believed in data,,but what happened,,even with the most respected newspaper,,is that the obsession to reduce everythingnto two simple percentage numbers,to make a powerful headline,made us focus on these two digits,and them alone.,In an effort to simplify the message,and draw a beautiful,ninevitable red and blue map,,we lost the point completely.,We somehow forgotnthat there were stories --,stories of human beingsnbehind these numbers. 
 In a different context,,but to a very similar point,,a peculiar challenge was presentednto my team by this woman.,She came to us with a lot of data,,but ultimately she wanted to tellnone of the most humane stories possible.,She's Samantha Cristoforetti.,She has been the firstnItalian woman astronaut,,and she contacted us before being launched,on a six-month-long expeditionnto the International Space Station.,She told us, "I'm going to space,,and I want to do something meaningfulnwith the data of my mission,to reach out to people.",A mission to thenInternational Space Station,comes with terabytes of data,about anything you can possibly imagine --,the orbits around Earth,,the speed and position of the ISS,and all of the other thousandsnof live streams from its sensors.,We had all of the hard datanwe could think of --,just like the punditsnbefore the election --,but what is the pointnof all these numbers?,People are not interestednin data for the sake of it,,because numbers are never the point.,They're always the means to an end.,The story we needed to tell,is that there is a human beingnin a teeny box,flying in space above your head,,and that you can actually see hernwith your naked eye on a clear night.,So we decided to use datanto create a connection,between Samantha and all of the peoplenlooking at her from below.,We designed and developednwhat we called "Friends in Space,",a web application that simplynlets you say "hello" to Samantha,from where you are,,and "hello" to all the peoplenwho are online at the same time,from all over the world.,And all of these "hellos"nleft visible marks on the map,as Samantha was flying by,and as she was actuallynwaving back every day at us,using Twitter from the ISS. 
 This made people see the mission's datanfrom a very different perspective.,It all suddenly became much morenabout our human nature and our curiosity,,rather than technology.,So data powered the experience,,but stories of human beingsnwere the drive.,The very positive responsenof its thousands of users,taught me a very important lesson --,that working with datanmeans designing ways,to transform the abstractnand the uncountable,into something that can be seen,nfelt and directly reconnected,to our lives and to our behaviors,,something that is hard to achieve,if we let the obsession for the numbersnand the technology around them,lead us in the process.,But we can do even more to connect datanto the stories they represent.,We can remove technology completely. 
 A few years ago, I met this other woman,,Stefanie Posavec --,a London-based designer who shares with menthe passion and obsession about data.,We didn't know each other,,but we decided to runna very radical experiment,,starting a communication using only data,,no other language,,and we opted for using no technologynwhatsoever to share our data.,In fact, our only means of communication,would be throughnthe old-fashioned post office.,For "Dear Data," every week for one year,,we used our personal datanto get to know each other --,personal data around weeklynshared mundane topics,,from our feelings,to the interactions with our partners,,from the compliments we receivednto the sounds of our surroundings.,Personal informationnthat we would then manually hand draw,on a postcard-size sheet of paper,that we would every weeknsend from London to New York,,where I live,,and from New York to London,nwhere she lives.,The front of the postcardnis the data drawing,,and the back of the card,contains the addressnof the other person, of course,,and the legend for hownto interpret our drawing.,The very first week into the project,,we actually chosena pretty cold and impersonal topic.,How many times do wencheck the time in a week?,So here is the front of my card,,and you can see that every little symbol,represents all of the timesnthat I checked the time,,positioned for daysnand different hours chronologically --,nothing really complicated here.,But then you see in the legend,how I added anecdotal detailsnabout these moments.,In fact, the different types of symbolsnindicate why I was checking the time --,what was I doing?,Was I bored? Was I hungry?,Was I late?,Did I check it on purposenor just casually glance at the clock?,And this is the key part --,representing the detailsnof my days and my personality,through my data collection.,Using data as a lens or a filternto discover and reveal, for example,,my never-ending anxiety for being late,,even though I'm absolutely always on time. 
 Stefanie and I spent one yearncollecting our data manually,to force us to focus on the nuancesnthat computers cannot gather --,or at least not yet --,using data also to explore our mindsnand the words we use,,and not only our activities.,Like at week number three,,where we tracked the "thank yous"nwe said and were received,,and when I realized that I thanknmostly people that I don't know.,Apparently I'm a compulsive thankernto waitresses and waiters,,but I definitely don't thank enoughnthe people who are close to me. 
 Over one year,,the process of actively noticingnand counting these types of actions,became a ritual.,It actually changed ourselves.,We became much morenin tune with ourselves,,much more aware of our behaviorsnand our surroundings.,Over one year, Stefanie and Inconnected at a very deep level,through our shared data diary,,but we could do this only becausenwe put ourselves in these numbers,,adding the contextsnof our very personal stories to them.,It was the only waynto make them truly meaningful,and representative of ourselves. 
 I am not asking younto start drawing your personal data,,or to find a pen pal across the ocean.,But I'm asking you to consider data --,all kind of data --,as the beginning of the conversation,and not the end.,Because data alonenwill never give us a solution.,And this is why data failed us so badly --,because we failed to includenthe right amount of context,to represent reality --,a nuanced, complicatednand intricate reality.,We kept looking at these two numbers,,obsessing with them,and pretending that our worldncould be reduced,to a couple digits and a horse race,,while the real stories,,the ones that really mattered,,were somewhere else. 
 What we missed looking at these storiesnonly through models and algorithms,is what I call "data humanism.",In the Renaissance humanism,,European intellectuals,placed the human nature instead of Godnat the center of their view of the world.,I believe something similarnneeds to happen,with the universe of data.,Now data are apparentlyntreated like a God --,keeper of infallible truthnfor our present and our future. 
 The experiencesnthat I shared with you today,taught me that to make data faithfullynrepresentative of our human nature,and to make sure they will notnmislead us anymore,,we need to start designing waysnto include empathy, imperfection,and human qualities,in how we collect, process,nanalyze and display them.,I do see a place where, ultimately,,instead of using datanonly to become more efficient,,we will all use datanto become more humane. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Imagine that when you walkednin here this evening,,you discovered that everybody in the roomnlooked almost exactly the same:,ageless, raceless,,generically good-looking.,That person sitting right next to you,might have the mostnidiosyncratic inner life,,but you don't have a clue,because we're all wearingnthe same blank expression all the time.,That is the kind of creepy transformationnthat is taking over cities,,only it applies to buildings, not people. 
 Cities are full of roughness and shadow,,texture and color.,You can still find architectural surfacesnof great individuality and character,in apartment buildings in Riga,and Yemen,,social housing in Vienna,,Hopi villages in Arizona,,brownstones in New York,,wooden houses in San Francisco.,These aren't palaces or cathedrals.,These are just ordinary residences,expressing the ordinarynsplendor of cities.,And the reason they're like thatnis that the need for shelter,is so bound up withnthe human desire for beauty.,Their rough surfacesngive us a touchable city.,Right? Streets that you can read,by running your fingersnover brick and stone. 
 But that's getting harder to do,,because cities are becoming smooth.,New downtowns sprout towers,that are almost alwaysnmade of concrete and steel,and covered in glass.,You can look at skylinesnall over the world --,Houston,,Guangzhou,,Frankfurt --,and you see the same armynof high-gloss robots,marching over the horizon.,Now, just think of everything we lose,when architects stop usingnthe full range of available materials.,When we reject granitenand limestone and sandstone,and wood and coppernand terra-cotta and brick,and wattle and plaster,,we simplify architecture,and we impoverish cities.,It's as if you reducednall of the world's cuisines,down to airline food. 
 (Laughter) 
 Chicken or pasta? 
 But worse still,,assemblies of glass towersnlike this one in Moscow,suggest a disdain for the civicnand communal aspects of urban living.,Right? Buildings like these are intendednto enrich their owners and tenants,,but not necessarilynthe lives of the rest of us,,those of us who navigatenthe spaces between the buildings.,And we expect to do so for free.,Shiny towers are an invasive species,and they are choking our citiesnand killing off public space.,We tend to think of a facadenas being like makeup,,a decorative layer applied at the endnto a building that's effectively complete.,But just because a facade is superficial,doesn't mean it's not also deep. 
 Let me give you an example,of how a city's surfacesnaffect the way we live in it.,When I visited Salamanca in Spain,,I gravitated to the Plaza Mayor,at all hours of the day.,Early in the morning,nsunlight rakes the facades,,sharpening shadows,,and at night, lamplightnsegments the buildings,into hundreds of distinct areas,,balconies and windows and arcades,,each one a separate pocketnof visual activity.,That detail and depth, that glamour,gives the plaza a theatrical quality.,It becomes a stagenwhere the generations can meet.,You have teenagersnsprawling on the pavers,,seniors monopolizing the benches,,and real life starts to looknlike an opera set.,The curtain goes up on Salamanca.,So just because I'm talkingnabout the exteriors of buildings,,not form, not function, not structure,,even so those surfacesngive texture to our lives,,because buildingsncreate the spaces around them,,and those spaces can draw people in,or push them away.,And the difference often has to donwith the quality of those exteriors. 
 So one contemporary equivalentnof the Plaza Mayor in Salamanca,is the Place de la Défense in Paris,,a windswept, glass-walled open space,that office workers hurry through,on the way from the metronto their cubicles,but otherwise spendnas little time in as possible.,In the early 1980s,nthe architect Philip Johnson,tried to recreate a graciousnEuropean plaza in Pittsburgh.,This is PPG Place,,a half acre of open spacenencircled by commercial buildings,made of mirrored glass.,And he ornamented those buildingsnwith metal trim and bays,and Gothic turrets,which really pop on the skyline.,But at ground level,,the plaza feels like a black glass cage.,I mean, sure, in summertime,kids are running back and forthnthrough the fountain,and there's ice-skating in the winter,,but it lacks the informalitynof a leisurely hangout.,It's just not the sort of placenyou really want to just hang out and chat. 
 Public spaces thrive or failnfor many different reasons.,Architecture is only one,,but it's an important one.,Some recent plazas,like Federation Square in Melbourne,or Superkilen in Copenhagen,succeed because they combine old and new,,rough and smooth,,neutral and bright colors,,and because they don't relynexcessively on glass. 
 Now, I'm not against glass.,It's an ancient and versatile material.,It's easy to manufacture and transport,and install and replace,and clean.,It comes in everythingnfrom enormous, ultraclear sheets,to translucent bricks.,New coatings make it change mood,in the shifting light.,In expensive cities like New York,nit has the magical power,of being able to multiplynreal estate values by allowing views,,which is really the only commoditynthat developers have to offer,to justify those surreal prices. 
 In the middle of the 19th century,,with the constructionnof the Crystal Palace in London,,glass leapt to the top of the listnof quintessentially modern substances.,By the mid-20th century,,it had come to dominatenthe downtowns of some American cities,,largely through somenreally spectacular office buildings,like Lever House in midtown Manhattan,ndesigned by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill.,Eventually, the technologynadvanced to the point,where architects could designnstructures so transparent,they practically disappear.,And along the way,,glass became the default materialnof the high-rise city,,and there's a verynpowerful reason for that.,Because as the world's populationsnconverge on cities,,the least fortunate packninto jerry-built shantytowns.,But hundreds of millions of peoplenneed apartments and places to work,in ever-larger buildings,,so it makes economic sensento put up towers,and wrap them in cheapnand practical curtain walls. 
 But glass has a limited ability,to be expressive.,This is a section of wall framing a plaza,in the pre-Hispanic city of Mitla,nin southern Mexico.,Those 2,000-year-old carvings,make it clear that this was a placenof high ritual significance.,Today we look at those and we can seena historical and textural continuity,between those carvings,nthe mountains all around,and that church which is builtnon top of the ruins,using stone plundered from the site.,In nearby Oaxaca,neven ordinary plaster buildings,become canvasses fornbright colors, political murals,and sophisticated graphic arts.,It's an intricate, communicative language,that an epidemic of glassnwould simply wipe out. 
 The good news isnthat architects and developers,have begun to rediscovernthe joys of texture,without backing away from modernity.,Some find innovative usesnfor old materials like brick,and terra-cotta.,Others invent new productsnlike the molded panels that Snøhetta used,to give the San FrancisconMuseum of Modern Art,that crinkly, sculptural quality.,The architect Stefano Boerineven created living facades.,This is his Vertical Forest,na pair of apartment towers in Milan,,whose most visible feature is greenery.,And Boeri is designing a version of thisnfor Nanjing in China.,And imagine if green facadesnwere as ubiquitous as glass ones,how much cleaner the airnin Chinese cities would become. 
 But the truth isnthat these are mostly one-offs,,boutique projects,,not easily reproduced at a global scale.,And that is the point.,When you use materialsnthat have a local significance,,you prevent citiesnfrom all looking the same.,Copper has a long history in New York --,the Statue of Liberty,,the crown of the Woolworth Building --,but it fell out of fashion for a long time,until SHoP Architects used itnto cover the American Copper Building,,a pair of twisting towersnon the East River.,It's not even finished,and you can see the waynsunset lights up that metallic facade,,which will weather to green as it ages. 
 Buildings can be like people.,Their faces broadcast their experience.,And that's an important point,,because when glass ages,,you just replace it,,and the building looksnpretty much the same way it did before,until eventually it's demolished.,Almost all other materialsnhave the ability,to absorb infusions of history and memory,,and project it into the present.,The firm Ennead,clad the Utah Natural History Museumnin Salt Lake City in copper and zinc,,ores that have been minednin the area for 150 years,and that also camouflage the buildingnagainst the ochre hills,so that you have a natural history museum,that reflects the region'snnatural history.,And when the ChinesenPritzker Prize winner Wang Shu,was building a history museum in Ningbo,,he didn't just createna wrapper for the past,,he built memory right into the walls,by using brick and stones and shingles,salvaged from villagesnthat had been demolished. 
 Now, architects can use glass,in equally lyrical and inventive ways.,Here in New York, two buildings,,one by Jean Nouvelnand this one by Frank Gehry,face off across West 19th Street,,and the play of reflectionsnthat they toss back and forth,is like a symphony in light.,But when a city defaults to glass,as it grows,,it becomes a hall of mirrors,,disquieting and cold.,After all, cities are placesnof concentrated variety,where the world's culturesnand languages and lifestyles,come together and mingle.,So rather than encase all that variety,and diversity in buildingsnof crushing sameness,,we should have an architecture that honorsnthe full range of the urban experience. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So there's this thing callednthe law of unintended consequences.,I thought it was just like a saying,,but it actually exists, I guess.,There's, like, academic papers about it.,And I'm a designer.,I don't like unintended consequences.,People hire me because they havenconsequences that they really intend,,and what they intend is for mento help them achieve those consequences.,So I live in fearnof unintended consequences.,And so this is a story aboutnconsequences intended and unintended. 
 I got called by an organizationncalled Robin Hood,to do a favor for them.,Robin Hood is based in New York,na wonderful philanthropic organization,that does what it says in the name.,They take from rich people,ngive it to poor people.,In this case, what they wanted to benefitnwas the New York City school system,,a huge enterprise that educatesnmore than a million students at a time,,and in buildings that are like this one,,old buildings, big buildings,,drafty buildings, sometimes buildingsnthat are in disrepair,,certainly buildingsnthat could use a renovation.,Robin Hood had this ambitionnto improve these buildings in some way,,but what they realized was,to fix the buildings would bentoo expensive and impractical.,So instead they tried to figure outnwhat one room they could go into,in each of these buildings,nin as many buildings that they could,,and fix that one room,so that they could improventhe lives of the children inside,as they were studying.,And what they came up withnwas the school library,,and they came up with this ideancalled the Library Initiative.,All the studentsnhave to pass through the library.,That's where the books are.,That's where the heartnand soul of the school is.,So let's fix these libraries. 
 So they did this wonderful thingnwhere they brought in,first 10, then 20, then more architects,,each one of whom was assigned a librarynto rethink what a library was.,They trained special librarians.,So they started this mighty enterprise,to reform public schoolsnby improving these libraries.,Then they called me up and they said,n"Could you make a little contribution?",I said, "Sure, what do you want me to do?",And they said, "Well, we want younto be the graphic designer,in charge of the whole thing.",And so I thought, I know what that means.nThat means I get to design a logo.,I know how to design that. I design logos.,That's what people come to me for.,So OK, let's design a logo for this thing.,Easy to do, actually,ncompared with architecture,and being a librarian.,Just do a logo, make a contribution,nand then you're out,,and you feel really good about yourself.,And I'm a great guy and I like to feelngood about myself when I do these favors. 
 So I thought, let's overdeliver.,I'm going to give you three logos,nall based on this one idea.,So you have three options,npick any of the three.,They're all great, I said.,So the basic idea wasnthese would be new school libraries,for New York schools,,and so the idea is that it's a new thing,na new idea that needs a new name.,What I wanted to do was dispel the ideanthat these were musty old libraries,,the kind of placesnthat everyone is bored with,,you know, not your grandparents' library.,Don't worry about that at all.,This is going to this new, exciting thing,,not a boring library. 
 So option number one:,so instead of thinking of it as a library,,think of it as a place where it is like:ndo talk, do make loud noises.,Right? So no shushing,nit's like a shush-free zone.,We're going to call it the Reading Room. 
 That was option number one.nOK, option number two.,Option number two was, wait for it,,OWL.,I'll meet you at OWL.,I'm getting my book from the OWL.nMeet you after school down at OWL.,I like that, right?nNow, what does OWL stand for?,Well, it could be One World Library,,or it could be Open. Wonder. Learn.,Or it could be -- and I figure librariansncould figure out other things it could be,because they know about words.,So other things, right?,And then look at this.nIt's like the eye of the owl.,This is irresistible in my opinion. 
 But there's even another idea.,Option number three.,Option number threenwas based actually on language.,It's the idea that "read"nis the past tense of "read,",and they're both spelled the same way.,So why don't we callnthis place The Red Zone?,I'll meet you at the Red Zone.,Are you Red? Get Red.,I'm well Red. 
 (Laughter) 
 I really loved this idea,,and I somehow was not focused on the idea,that librarians as a class are sort ofninterested in spelling and I don't know. 
 (Laughter) 
 But sometimes clevernessnis more important than spelling,,and I thought this would benone of those instances.,So usually when I make these presentations,I say there's just one questionnand the question should be,,"How can I thank you, Mike?",But in this case,nthe question was more like,,"Um, are you kidding?",Because, they said,,the premise of all this work,was that kids were borednwith old libraries, musty old libraries.,They were tired of them.,And instead, they said, these kidsnhave never really seen a library.,The school libraries in these schools,are really so dilapidated,nif they're there at all,,that they haven't bored anyone.,They haven't even been therento bore anyone at all.,So the idea was, just forgetnabout giving it a new name.,Just call it, one last try, a library.,Right? OK.,So I thought, OK, give it a little oomph?,Exclamation point?,Then -- this is because I'm clever --,move that into the "i,",make it red,,and there you have it,nthe Library Initiative.,So I thought, mission accomplished,nthere's your logo.,So what's interesting about this logo,nan unintended consequence,,was that it turned out thatnthey didn't really even need my design,because you could type it any font,nyou could write it by hand,,and when they startednsending emails around,,they just would use Shift and 1,,they'd get their own logonjust right out of the thing.,And I thought, well, that's fine.,Feel free to use that logo.,And then I embarkednon the real rollout of this thing --,working with every one of the architects,to put this logo on the front doornof their own library. Right? 
 So here's the big rollout.,Basically I'd worknwith different architects.,First Robin Hood was my client.nNow these architects were my client.,I'd say, "Here's your logo.nPut it on the door.","Here's your logo. Put it on both doors.","Here's your logo.nPut it off to the side.","Here's your logonrepeated all over to the top.",So everything was going swimmingly.,I just was saying,n"Here's your logo. Here's your logo." 
 Then I got a callnfrom one of the architects,,a guy named Richard Lewis,nand he says, "I've got a problem.,You're the graphics guy.nCan you solve it?",And I said, OK, sure.",And he said, "The problem isnthat there's a space,between the shelf and the ceiling.",So that sounds likenan architectural issue to me,,not a graphic design issue,nso I'm, "Go on.",And Richard says, "Well,nthe top shelf has to be low enough,for the kid to reach it,,but I'm in a big old building,nand the ceilings are really high,,so actually I've gotnall this space up there,and I need something like a mural.",And I'm like, "Whoa,nyou know, I'm a logo designer.,I'm not Diego Rivera or something.,I'm not a muralist.",And so he said, "But can't younthink of anything?",So I said, "OK, what if we justntook pictures of the kids in the school,and just put them aroundnthe top of the thing,,and maybe that could work.",And my wife is a photographer,,and I said, "Dorothy, there's no budget,,can you come to this schoolnin east New York, take these pictures?",And she did,,and if you go in Richard's library,,which is one of the first that opened,,it has this glorious friezenof, like, the heroes of the school,,oversized, looking down,into the little dollhousenof the real library, right?,And the kids were great,nhand-selected by the principals,and the librarian.,It just kind of creatednthis heroic atmosphere in this library,,this very dignified setting belownand the joy of the children above. 
 So naturally all the other librariansnin the other schools see this,and they said, well, we want murals too.,And I'm like, OK.,So then I think, well,nit can't be the same mural every time,,so Dorothy did another one,nand then she did another one,,but then we needed more help,,so I called an illustrator I knewnnamed Lynn Pauley,,and Lynn did these beautifulnpaintings of the kids.,Then I called a guy named Charles Wilkinnat a place called Automatic Design.,He did these amazing collages.,We had Rafael Esquer,do these great silhouettes.,He would work with the kids,nasking for words,,and then based on those prompts,,come up with this little,ndelirious kind of constellation,of silhouettesnof things that are in books.,Peter Arkle interviewed the kids,and had them talknabout their favorite books,and he put their testimonynas a frieze up there.,Stefan Sagmeister worked with Yuko Shimizu,and they did this amazingnmanga-style statement,,"Everyone who is honest is interesting,",that goes all the way around.,Christoph Niemann, brilliant illustrator,,did a whole series of things,where he embedded booksninto the faces and characters,and images and placesnthat you find in the books.,And then even Maira Kalman,did this amazing cryptic installationnof objects and words,that kind of go all aroundnand will fascinate students,for as long as it's up there. 
 So this was really satisfying,,and basically my role here was readingna series of dimensions to these artists,,and I would say,,"Three feet by 15 feet, whatever you want.,Let me know if you havenany problem with that.",And they would go and install these.nIt just was the greatest thing. 
 But the greatest thing, actually, was --,Every once in a while,,I'd get, like, an invitation in the mailnmade of construction paper,,and it would say, "You are invitednto the opening of our new library.",So you'd go to the library,nsay, you'd go to PS10,,and you'd go inside.,There'd be balloons,nthere'd be a student ambassador,,there'd be speeches that were read,,poetry that was writtennspecifically for the opening,,dignitaries would present peoplenwith certificates,,and the whole thingnwas just a delirious, fun party.,So I loved going to these things.,I would stand there dressed like this,nobviously not belonging,,and someone would say,n"What are you doing here, mister?",And I'd say, "Well, I'm part of the teamnthat designed this place.",And they'd said, "You do these shelves?",And I said, "No."n"You took the pictures up above.","No.","Well, what did you do?","You know when you came in?nThe sign over the door?","The sign that says library?" 
 (Laughter) 
 "Yeah, I did that!",And then they'd sort of go,n"OK. Nice work if you can get it.",So it was so satisfyingngoing to these little openings,despite the fact that I wasnkind of largely ignored or humiliated,,but it was actually funngoing to the openings,,so I decided that I wantednto get the people in my office,who had worked on these projects,nget the illustrators and photographers,,and I said, why don't we rent a van,and drive aroundnthe five boroughs of New York,and see how many we could hit at one time.,And eventually there werengoing to be 60 of these libraries,,so we probably got to seenmaybe half a dozen in one long day.,And the best thing of allnwas meeting these librarians,who kind of were running these,ntook possession of these places,like their private stagenupon which they were invited,to mesmerize their studentsnand bring the books to life,,and it was justnthis really exciting experience,for all of us to actuallynsee these things in action.,So we spent a long day doing this,and we were in the very last library.,It was still winter,nbecause it got dark early,,and the librarian says,,"I'm about to close down.nSo really nice having you here.,Hey, wait a second, do you want to seenhow I turn off the lights?",I'm like, "OK.",And she said, "I haventhis special way that I do it.",And then she showed me.,What she did was she turned outnevery light one by one by one by one,,and the last light she left on,was the light that illuminatednthe kids' faces,,and she said, "That's the last lightnI turn off every night,,because I like to remind myselfnwhy I come to work." 
 So when I started this whole thing,,remember, it was justnabout designing that logo,and being clever, come up with a new name?,The unintended consequence here,,which I would like to take credit for,and like to think I can think throughnthe experience to that extent,,but I can't.,I was just focused on a foot ahead of me,nas far as I could reach with my own hands.,Instead, way off in the distance,was a librarian,who was going to findnthe chain of consequences,that we had set in motion,,a source of inspiration,so that she in this casencould do her work really well.,40,000 kids a yearnare affected by these libraries.,They've been happeningnfor more than 10 years now,,so those librarians have kind of turned onna generation of children to books,and so it's been a thrill to find out,that sometimes unintended consequencesnare the best consequences. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)The school of architecturenthat I studied at some 30 years ago,happened to be across the streetnfrom the wonderful art gallery,designed by the greatnarchitect Louis Kahn.,I love the building,nand I used to visit it quite often.,One day,,I saw the security guard run his handnacross the concrete wall.,And it was the way he did it,,the expression on his face --,something touched me.,I could see that the security guardnwas moved by the building,and that architecture has that capacity,to move you.,I could see it, and I remember thinking,,"Wow. How does architecture do that?" 
 At school, I was learning to design,,but here -- here wasna reaction of the heart.,And it touched me to the core. 
 You know, you aspire for beauty,,for sensuousness, for atmosphere,nthe emotional response.,That's the realm of the ineffable,and the immeasurable.,And that's what you live for:,a chance to try. 
 So in 2003, there wasnan open call for designs,for the Bahá'í Temple for South America.,This was the first templenin all of South America.,It's a continental temple,,a hugely important milestonenfor the Bahá'í community,,because this would be the lastnof the continental temples,and would open the doornfor national and local temples to be built,around the world. 
 And the brief was deceptively simple,and unique in the annals of religion:,a circular room, nine sides,nnine entrances, nine paths,,allowing you to come to the templenfrom all directions,,nine symbolizing completeness,,perfection.,No pulpit, no sermons,,as there are no clergynin the Bahá'í faith.,And in a world which is putting up walls,,the design needed to express in form,the very opposite.,It had to be open, welcoming,to people of all faiths,nwalks of life, backgrounds,,or no faith at all;,a new form of sacred space,with no pattern,or models to draw from.,It was like designing one of the firstnchurches for Christianity,or one of the first mosques for Islam. 
 So we live in a secular world.,How do you design sacred space today?,And how do you even definenwhat's sacred today? 
 I stumbled across this beautiful quotenfrom the Bahá'í writings,,and it speaks to prayer.,It says that if you reach out in prayer,,and if your prayer is answered --nwhich is already very interesting --,that the pillars of your heartnwill become ashine. 
 And I loved this ideanof the inner and the outer,,like when you see someonenand you say, "That person is radiant.",And I was thinking, "My gosh,nhow could we make something,architectural out of that,,where you create a building,and it becomes alive with light?,Like alabaster, if you kiss it with light,nit becomes alive.,And I drew this sketch,,something with two layers, translucent,with structure in between capturing light.,Maybe a pure form,na single form of emanation,that you could imagine,would be all dome,and everything we kept makingnwas looking too much like an egg. 
 (Laughter) 
 A blob. 
 So you search.,You all know this crazy search,nletting the process take you,,and you live for the surprises.,And I remember quite by accident,I saw this little videonof a plant moving in light,,and it made me think of movement,,reach,,this idea that the templencould have reach,,like this reach for the divine.,You can imagine also,that movement within a circlencould mean movement and stillness,,like the cosmos,,something you see in many places. 
 (Laughter) 
 But rotation was not enough,,because we needed a form.,In the Bahá'í writings, it talks about,the temples being as perfectnas is humanly possible,,and we kept thinking,nwell, what is perfection?,And I remember I stumbled into this imagenof this Japanese basket,and thinking our Western notionsnof perfection need to be challenged,,that this wonderful silhouettenof this basket, this wonkiness,,and that it has the kind of dimplenof what you might imagine a shoulder,or the cheekbone,,and that kind of organic form.,And so we drew and made models,,these lines that merge at the top,,soft lines,,which became like drapery,and translucent veils and folding,,and the idea of not onlynfolding but torquing --,you remember the plantnand the way it was reaching.,And this started to becomenan interesting form,,carving the base, making the entrances. 
 And then we ended up with this.,This is this temple with two layers,,nine luminous veils,,embodied light,,soft-flowing lines,like luminescent drapery.,180 submissionsnwere received from 80 countries,,and this was selected. 
 So we went to the next stagenof how to build it.,We had submitted alabaster.,But alabaster was too soft,,and we were experimenting,nmany experiments with materials,,trying to think how we could haventhis kind of shimmer,,and we ended up with borosilicate.,And borosilicate glass,nas you know, is very strong,,and if you break borosilicate rodsnjust so and melt them,at just the right temperature,,we ended up with this new material,,this new cast glass which took usnabout two years to make.,And it had this quality that we loved,,this idea of the embodied light,,but on the inside, we wantednsomething with a soft light,,like the inner lining of a jacket.,On the outside you have protection,nbut on the inside you touch it.,So we found this tiny veinnin a huge quarry in Portugal,with this beautiful stone,,which the owner had keptnfor seven generations in his family,,waiting for the right project,nif you can believe it.,Look at this material, it's beautiful.,And the way it lights up;nit has that translucent quality. 
 So here you see the structure.,It lets the light through.,And looking down,,the nine wings are bound,,structurally but symbolically strong,,a great symbol of unity:,pure geometry, a perfect circle,,30 meters in section and in plan,,perfectly symmetrical,,like the idea of sacredness and geometry.,And here you see the building going up,,2,000 steel nodes,,9,000 pieces of steel,,7,800 stone pieces,,10,000 cast glass pieces,nall individual shapes,,the entire superstructure all described,,engineered, fabricatednwith aerospace technology,,prefabricated machine to machine,,robotically,,a huge team effort, you can imagine,,of literally hundreds,,and within three percentnof our $30 million budget,set in 2006. 
 (Applause) 
 Nine wings bound together,forming a nine-pointed star,,and the star shape moving in space,,tracking the sun. 
 So here it is. 
 Audience: Wow! 
 (Applause) 
 Hopefully, a befitting responsento that beautiful quote,,"a prayer answered,",open in all directions,,capturing the blue light of dawn,,tent-like white light of day,,the gold light of the afternoon,,and of course, at night, the reversal:,sensuous,,catching the light in all kindsnof mysterious ways. 
 And the site: it's interesting;n14 years ago when we made the submission,,we showed the templenset against the Andes.,We didn't have the Andes as our site,,but after nine years, that's exactlynwhere we ended up,,the lines of the temple set againstnnothing but pure nature,,and you turn around and you getnnothing but the city below you,,and inside, a view in all directions,,radiating gardens,from each of the alcoves,,radiating paths. 
 Last October, the opening ceremonies --,a beautiful, sacred event,,5,000 people from 80 countries,,a continuous river of visitors,,indigenous peoplenfrom all over South America,,some who had never left their villages.,And of course, that this templenbelongs to people,,the collective, of many culturesnand walks of life,,many beliefs,,and for me, what's most importantnis what it feels like on the inside;,that it feel intimate,,sacred,,and that everyone is welcome.,And if even a few who come,have the same reactionnas that security guard,,then it truly would be their temple.,And I would love that. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I want to give you a new perspective.,That sounds grandiose, and it is.,I left Ireland yesterday morning.,I traveled from Dublin to New York,independently.,But the design of an airport,,plane and terminal,offers little independence whennyou're 105 and a half centimeters tall.,For Americans, that's 3' 5".,I was whisked through the airportnby airline assistants in a wheelchair.,Now, I don't need to use a wheelchair,,but the design of an airport,and its lack of accessibility,means that it's my only waynto get through.,With my carry-on bag between my feet,,I was wheeled throughnsecurity, preclearance,and I arrived at my boarding gate. 
 I use the accessibilitynservices in the airport,because most of the terminalnis just not designed with me in mind.,Take security, for example.,I'm not strong enoughnto lift my carry-on bag,from the ground to the carousel.,I stand at eye level with it.,And those who work in that spacenfor safety purposes cannot help me,and cannot do it for me.,Design inhibits my autonomynand my independence.,But traveling at this size,nit isn't all bad.,The leg room in economynis like business class. 
 (Laughter) 
 I often forget that I'm a little person.,It's the physical environmentnand society that remind me.,Using a public bathroomnis an excruciating experience.,I walk into the cubicle,but I can't reach the lock on the door.,I'm creative and resilient.,I look around and see if there'sna bin that I can turn upside down.,Is it safe?,Not really.,Is it hygienic and sanitary?,Definitely not.,But the alternative is much worse.,If that doesn't work, I use my phone.,It gives me an additionalnfour- to six-inch reach,,and I try to jam the lock closednwith my iPhone.,Now, I imagine that's not what Jony Ivenhad in mind when he designed the iPhone,,but it works.,The alternativenis that I approach a stranger.,I apologize profusely,and I ask them to stand guardnoutside my cubicle door.,They do,and I emerge grateful,but absolutely mortified,,and hope that they didn't notice,that I left the bathroomnwithout washing my hands.,I carry hand sanitizer with menevery single day,because the sink, soap dispenser,nhand dryer and mirror,are all out of my reach. 
 Now, the accessible bathroomnis somewhat of an option.,In this space, I can reachnthe lock on the door,,the sink, the soap dispenser,nthe hand dryer and the mirror.,Yet, I cannot use the toilet.,It is deliberately designed higher,so that wheelchair usersncan transfer across with ease.,This is a wonderfulnand necessary innovation,,but in the design world, when we describena new project or idea as accessible,,what does that mean?,Who is it accessible to?,And whose needsnare not being accommodated for? 
 Now, the bathroom is an example,of where design impinges upon my dignity,,but the physical environment impactsnupon me in much more casual ways too,,something as simplenas ordering a cup of coffee.,Now, I'll admit it.,I drink far too much coffee.,My order is a skinny vanilla latte,,but I'm tryingnto wean myself off the syrup.,But the coffee shop,nit's not designed well,,at least not for me.,Queuing, I'm standingnbeside the pastry cabinet,and the barista calls for the next order.,"Next, please!" they shout.,They can't see me.,The person next to me in the queuenpoints to my existence,and everyone is embarrassed.,I order as quick as I cannand I move along to collect my coffee.,Now, think just for a second.,Where do they put it?,Up high and without a lid.,Reaching up to collect a coffeenthat I have paid for,is an incredibly dangerous experience. 
 But design also impingesnon the clothes that I want to wear.,I want garmentsnthat reflect my personality.,It's difficult to findnin the childrenswear department.,And often womenswearnrequires far too many alterations.,I want shoes that affect my maturity,nprofessionalism and sophistication.,Instead, I'm offered sneakersnwith Velcro straps and light-up shoes.,Now, I'm not totally opposednto light-up shoes. 
 (Laughter) 
 But design also impactsnon such simple things,,like sitting on a chair.,I cannot go from a standingnto a seating position with grace.,Due to the standardsnof design heights of chairs,,I have to crawl on my hands and knees,just to get on top of it,,whilst also being consciousnthat it might tip over at any stage. 
 But whilst design impacts on me,whether it's a chair,na bathroom, a coffee shop, or clothes,,I rely on and benefit,from the kindness of strangers.,But not everybody is so nice.,I'm reminded that I'm a little person,when a stranger points,,stares,,laughs,,calls me a name,,or takes a photograph of me.,This happens almost every day.,With the rise of social media,nit has given me an opportunity,and a platform to have a voicenas a blogger and as an activist,,but it has also made me nervous,that I might become a meme,or a viral sensation,,all without my consent. 
 So let's take a moment right now,to make something very clear.,The word "midget" is a slur.,It evolved from PT Barnum's eranof circuses and freak shows.,Society has evolved.,So should our vocabulary.,Language is a powerful tool.,It does not just name our society.,It shapes it. 
 I am incredibly proudnto be a little person,,to have inheritednthe condition of achondroplasia.,But I am most proud to be Sinead.,Achondroplasia isnthe most common form of dwarfism.,Achondroplasia translatesnas "without cartilage formation.",I have short limbsnand achondroplastic facial features,,my forehead and my nose.,My arms do not straighten fully,,but I can lick my elbow.,I'm not showing you that one.,Achondroplasia occurs in approximatelynone in every 20,000 births.,80 percent of little peoplenare born to two average-height parents.,That means that anybody in this roomncould have a child with achondroplasia.,Yet, I inherited my condition from my dad.,I'd like to show you a photo of my family.,My mother is average height,,my father is a little person,and I am the eldest of five children.,I have three sisters and one brother.,They are all average height.,I am incredibly fortunatento have been born into a family,that cultivatednmy curiosity and my tenacity,,that protected me from the unkindnessnand ignorance of strangers,and that armed me with the resilience,ncreativity and confidence,that I needed to survive and manipulatenthe physical environment and society.,If I was to pinpoint any reasonnwhy I am successful,,it is because I wasnand I am a loved child,,now, a loved childnwith a lot of sass and sarcasm,,but a loved child nonetheless. 
 In giving you an insightninto who I am today,I wanted to offer you a new perspective.,I wanted to challenge the idea,that design is but a toolnto create function and beauty.,Design greatly impactsnupon people's lives,,all lives.,Design is a way in whichnwe can feel included in the world,,but it is also a way in whichnwe can uphold a person's dignity,and their human rights.,Design can also inflict vulnerability,on a group whose needs aren't considered. 
 So today, I wantnyour perceptions challenged.,Who are we not designing for?,How can we amplify their voices,and their experiences?,What is the next step?,Design is an enormous privilege,,but it is a bigger responsibility.,I want you to open your eyes. 
 Thank you so much.

 (Applause)It's Christmas Eve, 1968.,The Apollo 8 spacecraftnhas successfully completed,its first three orbits around the moon.,Launched from Cape Canaveralnthree days before,,this is the first time,that humans have ever travelednbeyond low Earth orbit.,On the vessel's fourth pass,,the Earth slowly comes into view,and reveals itselfnabove the Moon's horizon.,Astronaut Bill Anders franticallynasks his crewmates where their camera is,,grabs the Hasselblad,npoints it towards the window,,presses the shutter,,and takes one of the mostnimportant photographs of all time:,"Earthrise." 
 When the crew was safely homena few days later,,they were asked about the mission.,Anders famously replied,,"We went to the moon,,but we actually discovered Earth." 
 What did he and his fellow crewmates feel,in this incredible moment?,In a study released just this past year,,a team of researchersnat the University of Pennsylvania,examined the testimoniesnof hundreds of astronauts,who had the opportunitynto view the Earth from space.,Their analysis uncoverednthree common feelings:,first, a greater appreciationnfor Earth's beauty;,second, an increased sensenof connection to all other living beings;,and third, an unexpected,noften overwhelming sense of emotion.,The researchers believe that seeingnthe Earth from a great distance,provokes someone to developnnew cognitive frameworks,to understand what they are seeing.,They believe these astronautsnwere forever changed,by this new view,,this new perspective,,this new visual truth.,This feeling is commonly referred tonas the "overview effect." 
 Only 558 peoplenhave ever been to outer space.,558 people had the opportunity,to gaze down in awe,,to wonder at our planet,floating in an infinite sea of darkness.,But what if that number were bigger? 
 Three years ago,nI set off on my own mission:,to see if I could bring this feelingnof overwhelming scale and beauty,to many more people,just by using one small computer,in my small New York City apartment.,It was then, in 2013,nthat I launched "Daily Overview.",Every day, I have used satellite imagery,to create one expansivenoverhead view of our planet.,More than 1,000 of these imagesnhave been created thus far,,and more than 600,000 people,tune in for this daily dosenof perspectives.,I create the imagery by curating photosnfrom the massive archive,of a satellite companyncalled Digital Globe.,They operate a constellationnof five satellites,,each roughly the size of an ambulance,,that is constantlyntaking pictures of the Earth,as they orbit atn28,000 kilometers per hour. 
 Now, what does this mean?,Each of these satellitesnis equipped with a camera,that has a focal length of 16 meters,,so that's roughly 290 times greater,than a DSLR camera equippednwith a standard 55 millimeter lens.,So if were able to attachnone of their satellites,to the roof of this theater in Oxford,,we could take a picture of a football,,clearly, on the pitchnat the stadium in Amsterdam.,That's 450 kilometers away.,That's incredibly powerful technology.,And I decided at the beginningnof this project,that I would usenthat incredible technology,to focus on the places,where humans have impacted the planet. 
 As a species, we dig and scrapenthe Earth for resources,,we produce energy,,we raise animalsnand cultivate crops for food,,we build cities, we move around,,we create waste.,And in the processnof doing all of these things,,we shape landscapes and seascapes,and cityscapes with increasingncontrol and impunity.,So with that in mind,,I would like to sharena few of my overviews with you now. 
 Here we see cargo ships and oil tankers,waiting outside the entrynto the port of Singapore.,This facility is the second-busiestnin the world by terms of total tonnage,,accounting for one-fifthnof the world's shipping containers,and one half of the annual supply,of crude oil. 
 If you look closely at this overview,nyou'll see a lot of little specks.,Those are actually cows at a feedlot,in Summerfield, Texas,nin the United States.,So once cows reach a particular weight,,roughly 300 kilograms,,they are moved herenand placed on a specialized diet.,Over the next three to four months,nthe cows gain an additional 180 kilograms,before they are shipped off to slaughter.,You're also probably wonderingnabout this glowing pool at the top there.,That gets its color from a uniquencombination of manure, chemicals,and a particular type of algaenthat grows in the stagnant water. 
 This is the Mount Whaleback iron ore mine,in the Pilbara regionnof Western Australia,,a beautiful yet scary scarnon the face of the Earth.,Of the world's mined iron ore,,98 percent is used to make steel,and is therefore a major componentnin the construction of buildings,,automobiles or appliancesnsuch as your dishwasher or refrigerator. 
 This is a solar concentratornin Seville, Spain.,So this facility contains 2,650 mirrors,which are arrayed in concentric circlesnaround an 140-meter-tall tower,at its center.,At the top of the tower,,there is a capsule of molten salt,that gets heated by the beamsnof light reflected upwards,from the mirrors below.,From there, the salt circulatesnto a storage tank underground,,where it produces steam,,which spins turbines,and generates enough electricitynto power 70,000 homes,and offsets 30,000 tonsnof carbon dioxide emissions every year. 
 This overview shows deforestationnin Santa Cruz, Bolivia,immediately adjacentnto untouched tracts of rainforest.,Deforestation in the countrynhas primarily been driven,by the expansion of mechanized agriculture,and cattle ranching,,so as the country tries to meetnthe demand of its growing population,and feed them,,the sacrificial destructionnof its rainforest,has taken place to do so.,It is estimated that the countrynlost 4.5 million acres of rainforest,in one decade alone,from 2000 until 2010. 
 This is the Eixample districtnin Barcelona, Spain.,So the overview perspectivencan be incredibly helpful,to help us understand how cities function,and how we can devisensmarter solutions for urban planning,,and this will become only more relevant,as it is expected that 4.9 billion peoplenwill live in cities around the world,by the year 2030.,This area of Barcelona is characterizednby its strict grid pattern,,apartments with communal courtyards,and these octagonal intersections,which allow for more sunlight,nbetter ventilation,and additional parking at street level. 
 And here we see that grid patternnbut under much different circumstances.,This is the Dadaab Refugee Campnin northern Kenya,,the largest such facilitynof its kind in the world.,To cope with the influx of refugeesnwho are fleeing Somalia,,where there is famine and conflict,,the UN has built this areangridded out at left,called the LFO extension,to house more and more refugees,who are arriving and occupyingnthese white dots,,which are actually tents,which will slowly fill upnthe area over time. 
 So if you have one of these overviews,,you have a moment in time.,If we have two overviews, however,,we are able to tell storiesnabout changes in time.,I call that featurenof the project "Juxtapose,",and we'll share a few examplesnof it with you now. 
 So the tulip fields in Netherlandsnbloom every year in April.,So we take an imagencaptured in March a few weeks before,and contrast it to onentaken a few weeks later.,We're able to watch the flowers bloomnin this magnificent cascade of color.,It is estimated that the Dutch producen4.3 billion tulip bulbs every year. 
 In 2015, two dams collapsed,at an iron ore minenin southeastern Brazil,,causing one of the worstnenvironmental disasters,in the history of the country.,It is estimated that 62 millionncubic meters of waste,were released when the dams broke,,destroying numerous villagesnin the process,,including Bento Rodrigues,nseen here before ...,and after the flood.,Ultimately, 19 peoplenwere killed in this disaster.,Half a million people did notnhave access to clean drinking water,for an extended period of time,,and the waste soon enteredninto the Doce River,,extended for 650 kilometers,all the way into the sea,,killing unknowable amountsnof plant and animal life along the way. 
 And lastly, here is a storynrelated to the crisis in Syria,,a conflict which has claimed the livesnof hundreds of thousands of people,and displaced millions.,So this patch of desertnis seen in Mafraq, Jordan in 2011,,the year the conflict started,,and when we compare it to an imagencaptured just this year in 2017,,we see the constructionnof the Zaatari refugee camp. 
 So just as the astronauts of Apollo 8,watched the Earth rising aboventhe lunar landscape for the first time,,there is no waynthat you could have imagined,what the places I just showed younlook like from outer space.,And while you may enjoynthe aesthetics of an image,,once you learn exactlynwhat it is you're seeing,,you may struggle with the factnthat you still like it.,And that's the tensionnI want to create with my work,,because I believenit is that contemplation,,that internal dialogue,that will lead to greaterninterest in our planet,and more awarenessnof what we're doing to it. 
 I believe that viewing the Earthnfrom the overview perspective,is more important now than ever before.,Through the incredible technologynof these high-flying cameras,,we can see, monitor and expose,the unprecedented impactnthat we are having.,And whether we are scientists,or engineers or policymakers,or investors or artists,,if we can adoptna more expansive perspective,,embrace the truth of what is going on,and contemplate the long-termnhealth of our planet,,we will create a better,and safer and smarter future,for our one and only home. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I come to you today to speak of liars,,lawsuits,and laughter.,The first time I heardnabout Holocaust denial,,I laughed.,Holocaust denial?,The Holocaust which hasnthe dubious distinction,of being the best-documentedngenocide in the world?,Who could believe it didn't happen? 
 Think about it.,For deniers to be right,,who would have to be wrong?,Well, first of all, the victims --,the survivors who have told usntheir harrowing stories.,Who else would have to be wrong?,The bystanders.,The people who lived in the myriadsnof towns and villages and cities,on the Eastern front,,who watched their neighborsnbe rounded up --,men, women, children, young, old --,and be marchednto the outskirts of the town,to be shot and left dead in ditches.,Or the Poles,,who lived in towns and villagesnaround the death camps,,who watched day after day,as the trains went in filled with people,and came out empty. 
 But above all, who would have to be wrong?,The perpetrators.,The people who say, "We did it.,I did it.",Now, maybe they add a caveat.,They say, "I didn't have a choice;nI was forced to do it.",But nonetheless, they say, "I did it.",Think about it.,In not one war crimes trialnsince the end of World War II,has a perpetrator of any nationalitynever said, "It didn't happen.",Again, they may have said, "I was forced,"nbut never that it didn't happen.,Having thought that through,,I decided denial was notngoing to be on my agenda;,I had bigger things to worry about,nto write about, to research,,and I moved on. 
 Fast-forward a little over a decade,,and two senior scholars --,two of the most prominent historiansnof the Holocaust --,approached me and said,,"Deborah, let's have coffee.,We have a research ideanthat we think is perfect for you.",Intrigued and flatterednthat they came to me with an idea,and thought me worthy of it,,I asked, "What is it?",And they said, "Holocaust denial.",And for the second time, I laughed.,Holocaust denial?,The Flat Earth folks?,The Elvis-is-alive people?,I should study them?,And these two guys said,,"Yeah, we're intrigued.,What are they about?,What's their objective?,How do they manage to get peoplento believe what they say?" 
 So thinking, if they thoughtnit was worthwhile,,I would take a momentary diversion --,maybe a year, maybe two,nthree, maybe even four --,in academic terms, that's momentary. 
 (Laughter) 
 We work very slowly. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I would look at them.,So I did.,I did my research, and I came upnwith a number of things,,two of which I'd like to sharenwith you today. 
 One:,deniers are wolves in sheep's clothing.,They are the same: Nazis, neo-Nazis --,you can decide whether you wantnto put a "neo" there or not.,But when I looked at them,,I didn't see any SS-like uniforms,,swastika-like symbols on the wall,,Sieg Heil salutes --,none of that.,What I found instead,were people paradingnas respectable academics. 
 What did they have?,They had an institute.,An "Institute for Historical Review.",They had a journal -- a slick journal --,a "Journal of Historical Review.",One filled with papers --,footnote-laden papers.,And they had a new name.,Not neo-Nazis,,not anti-Semites --,revisionists.,They said, "We are revisionists.,We are out to do one thing:,to revise mistakes in history.",But all you had to do was gonone inch below the surface,,and what did you find there?,The same adulation of Hitler,,praise of the Third Reich,,anti-Semitism, racism, prejudice.,This is what intrigued me.,It was anti-Semitism, racism, prejudice,nparading as rational discourse. 
 The other thing I found --,many of us have been taught to thinknthere are facts and there are opinions --,after studying deniers,,I think differently.,There are facts,,there are opinions,,and there are lies.,And what deniers want to donis take their lies,,dress them up as opinions --,maybe edgy opinions,,maybe sort of out-of-the-box opinions --,but then if they're opinions,,they should be part of the conversation.,And then they encroach on the facts. 
 I published my work --,the book was published,,"Denying the Holocaust: The GrowingnAssault on Truth and Memory,",it came out in many different countries,,including here in Penguin UK,,and I was done with those folksnand ready to move on.,Then came the letter from Penguin UK.,And for the third time, I laughed ...,mistakenly.,I opened the letter,,and it informed me that David Irvingnwas bringing a libel suit against me,in the United Kingdom,for calling him a Holocaust denier. 
 David Irving suing me?,Who was David Irving?,David Irving was a writernof historical works,,most of them about World War II,,and virtually all of those worksntook the position,that the Nazis were really not so bad,,and the Allies were really not so good.,And the Jews, whatever happened to them,,they sort of deserved it.,He knew the documents,,he knew the facts,,but he somehow twisted themnto get this opinion.,He hadn't always been a Holocaust denier,,but in the late '80s,,he embraced it with great vigor. 
 The reason I laughed alsonwas this was a man,who not only was a Holocaust denier,,but seemed quite proud of it.,Here was a man -- and I quote --,who said, "I'm going to sinknthe battleship Auschwitz.",Here was a man,who pointed to the number tattooednon a survivor's arm and said,,"How much money have you made,from having that numberntattooed on your arm?",Here was a man who said,,"More people died in Senator Kennedy's car,at Chappaquiddick,than died in gas chambers at Auschwitz.",That's an American reference,nbut you can look it up.,This was not a man who seemednat all ashamed or reticent,about being a Holocaust denier. 
 Now, lots of my academicncolleagues counseled me --,"Eh, Deborah, just ignore it.",When I explained you can't justnignore a libel suit,,they said, "Who's going tonbelieve him anyway?",But here was the problem:,British law put the onus,nput the burden of proof on me,to prove the truth of what I said,,in contrast to as it would havenbeen in the United States,and in many other countries:,on him to prove the falsehood. 
 What did that mean?,That meant if I didn't fight,,he would win by default.,And if he won by default,,he could then legitimately say,,"My David Irving version of the Holocaustnis a legitimate version.,Deborah Lipstadt was foundnto have libeled me,when she called me a Holocaust denier.,Ipso facto, I, David Irving,nam not a Holocaust denier.",And what is that version?,There was no plan to murder the Jews,,there were no gas chambers,,there were no mass shootings,,Hitler had nothing to donwith any suffering that went on,,and the Jews have made this all up,to get money from Germany,and to get a state,,and they've done it with the aidnand abettance of the Allies --,they've planted the documentsnand planted the evidence. 
 I couldn't let that stand,and ever face a survivor,or a child of survivors.,I couldn't let that stand,and consider myselfna responsible historian.,So we fought.,And for those of younwho haven't seen "Denial,",spoiler alert:,we won. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 The judge found David Irving,to be a liar,,a racist,,an anti-Semite.,His view of history was tendentious,,he lied, he distorted --,and most importantly,,he did it deliberately.,We showed a pattern,nin over 25 different major instances.,Not small things -- many of usnin this audience write books,,are writing books;,we always make mistakes, that's whynwe're glad to have second editions:,correct the mistakes. 
 (Laughter) 
 But these always movednin the same direction:,blame the Jews,,exonerate the Nazis. 
 But how did we win?,What we did is follow his footnotesnback to his sources.,And what did we find?,Not in most cases,,and not in the preponderance of cases,,but in every single instance wherenhe made some reference to the Holocaust,,that his supposed evidence was distorted,,half-truth,,date-changed,,sequence-changed,,someone put at a meeting who wasn't there.,In other words,nhe didn't have the evidence.,His evidence didn't prove it.,We didn't prove what happened.,We proved that what he said happened --,and by extension, all deniers,nbecause he either quotes them,or they get their arguments from him --,is not true.,What they claim --,they don't have the evidence to prove it. 
 So why is my storynmore than just the story,of a quirky, long,nsix-year, difficult lawsuit,,an American professornbeing dragged into a courtroom,by a man that the courtndeclared in its judgment,was a neo-Nazi polemicist?,What message does it have?,I think in the contextnof the question of truth,,it has a very significant message.,Because today,,as we well know,,truth and facts are under assault.,Social media, for allnthe gifts it has given us,,has also allowed the differencenbetween facts -- established facts --,and lies,to be flattened. 
 Third of all:,extremism.,You may not see Ku Klux Klan robes,,you may not see burning crosses,,you may not even hear outrightnwhite supremacist language.,It may go by names: "alt-right,"n"National Front" -- pick your names.,But underneath, it's that same extremismnthat I found in Holocaust denial,parading as rational discourse. 
 We live in an agenwhere truth is on the defensive.,I'm reminded of a New Yorker cartoon.,A quiz show recently appearednin "The New Yorker",where the host of the quiz shownis saying to one of the contestants,,"Yes, ma'am, you had the right answer.,But your opponent yellednmore loudly than you did,,so he gets the point." 
 What can we do?,First of all,,we cannot be beguilednby rational appearances.,We've got to look underneath,,and we will find there the extremism.,Second of all,,we must understandnthat truth is not relative.,Number three,,we must go on the offensive,,not the defensive.,When someone makes an outrageous claim,,even though they may holdnone of the highest offices in the land,,if not the world --,we must say to them,,"Where's the proof?,Where's the evidence?",We must hold their feet to the fire.,We must not treat it as if their liesnare the same as the facts. 
 And as I said earlier,ntruth is not relative.,Many of us have grown upnin the world of the academy,and enlightened liberal thought,,where we're taughtneverything is open to debate.,But that's not the case.,There are certain things that are true.,There are indisputable facts --,objective truths.,Galileo taught it to us centuries ago.,Even after being forcednto recant by the Vatican,that the Earth moved around the Sun,,he came out,,and what is he reported to have said?,"And yet, it still moves." 
 The Earth is not flat.,The climate is changing.,Elvis is not alive. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 And most importantly,,truth and fact are under assault.,The job ahead of us,,the task ahead of us,,the challenge ahead of us,is great.,The time to fight is short.,We must act now.,Later will be too late. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)We are all activists now. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 I'll just stop here. 
 (Laughter) 
 From the families who are fightingnto maintain funding for public schools,,the tens of thousands of peoplenwho joined Occupy Wall Street,or marched with Black Lives Matter,to protest police brutalitynagainst African Americans,,families that join rallies,,pro-life and pro-choice,,those of us who are afraid,that our friends and neighborsnare going to be deported,or that they'll be added to lists,because they are Muslim,,people who advocate for gun rightsnand for gun control,and the millions of peoplenwho joined the women's marches,all across the country this last January. 
 (Applause) 
 We are all activists now,,and that means that we all have somethingnto worry about from surveillance.,Surveillance meansngovernment collection and use,of private and sensitive data about us.,And surveillance is essential,to law enforcementnand to national security.,But the history of surveillance,is one that includes surveillance abuses,where this sensitive informationnhas been used against people,because of their race,,their national origin,,their sexual orientation,,and in particular,nbecause of their activism,,their political beliefs. 
 About 53 years ago,,Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.ngave his "I have a dream" speech,on the Mall in Washington.,And today the ideas behind this speechnof racial equality and tolerance,are so noncontroversial,that my daughtersnstudy the speech in third grade.,But at the time,,Dr. King was extremely controversial.,The legendary and notoriousnFBI Director J. Edgar Hoover believed,,or wanted to believe,,that the Civil Rights Movementnwas a Soviet communist plot,intended to destabilizenthe American government.,And so Hoover had his agentsnput bugs in Dr. King's hotel rooms,,and those bugs picked up conversationsnbetween civil rights leaders,talking about the strategies and tacticsnof the Civil Rights Movement.,They also picked up sounds of Dr. King,having sex with womennwho were not his wife,,and J. Edgar Hoovernsaw the opportunity here,to discredit and underminenthe Civil Rights Movement.,The FBI sent a package of these recordings,along with a handwritten note to Dr. King,,and a draft of this notenwas found in FBI archives years later,,and the letter said,,"You are no clergyman and you know it.,King, like all frauds,nyour end is approaching.",The letter even seemednto encourage Dr. King to commit suicide,,saying, "King, there isnonly one thing left for you to do.,You know what it is.,You better take it beforenyour filthy, abnormal, fraudulent self,is bared to the nation." 
 But the important thing is,,Dr. King was not abnormal.,Every one of us has somethingnthat we want to hide from somebody.,And even more important,,J. Edgar Hoover wasn't abnormal either.,The history of surveillance abuses,is not the historynof one bad, megalomaniacal man.,Throughout his decades at the FBI,,J. Edgar Hoover enjoyed the supportnof the presidents that he served,,Democratic and Republican alike.,After all, it was John F. Kennedynand his brother Robert Kennedy,who knew about and approvednthe surveillance of Dr. King.,Hoover ran a programncalled COINTELPRO for 15 years,which was designednto spy on and undermine civic groups,that were devotednto things like civil rights,,the Women's Rights Movement,,and peace groups and anti-war movements.,And the surveillance didn't stop there.,Lyndon Baines Johnson,,during the election campaign,,had the campaign airplanenof his rival Barry Goldwater bugged,as part of his effortnto win that election.,And then, of course, there was Watergate.,Burglars were caught,breaking into the DemocraticnNational Committee headquarters,at the Watergate Hotel,,the Nixon administration was involvednin covering up the burglary,,and eventually Nixonnhad to step down as president.,COINTELPRO and Watergatenwere a wake-up call for Americans.,Surveillance was out of control,and it was being usednto squelch political challengers.,And so Americans rose to the occasion,and what we did wasnwe reformed surveillance law.,And the primary tool we usednto reform surveillance law,was to require a search warrant,for the government to be able to getnaccess to our phone calls and our letters.,Now, the reason whyna search warrant is important,is because it interposes a judge,in the relationshipnbetween investigators and the citizens,,and that judge's job is to make sure,that there's good causenfor the surveillance,,that the surveillancenis targeted at the right people,,and that the information that's collected,is going to be usednfor legitimate government purposes,and not for discriminatory ones.,This was our system,,and what this means is,that President Obamandid not wiretap Trump Tower.,The system is set up to preventnsomething like that from happening,without a judge being involved. 
 But what happens when we're not talkingnabout phone calls or letters anymore?,Today, we have technology,that makes it cheap and easynfor the government to collect information,on ordinary everyday people.,Your phone call records,can reveal whether you have an addiction,,what your religion is,,what charities you donate to,,what political candidate you support.,And yet, our governmentncollected, dragnet-style,,Americans' calling records for years.,In 2012, the RepublicannNational Convention,highlighted a new technologynit was planning to use,,facial recognition,,to identify peoplenwho were going to be in the crowd,who might be activists or troublemakers,and to stop them ahead of time.,Today, over 50 percent of American adults,have their faceprintnin a government database.,The Bureau of Alcohol,nTobacco, Firearms and Explosives,concocted a plan,to find out what Americansnwere going to gun shows,by using license plate detectors,to scan the license plates of cars,that were in the parking lotsnof these events.,Today, we believe that over 70 percentnof police departments,have automatic license platendetection technology,that they're using to track people's carsnas they drive through town.,And all of this information,,the license plates, the faceprints,,the phone records,,your address books, your buddy lists,,the photos that you uploadnto Dropbox or Google Photos,,and sometimes evennyour chats and your emails,are not protectednby a warrant requirement.,So what that means is we havenall of this information on regular people,that's newly availablenat very low expense.,It is the golden age for surveillance. 
 Now, every parent is goingnto understand what this means.,When you have a little baby,and the baby's young,,that child is not ablento climb out of its crib.,But eventually your little girl gets older,and she's able to climb out of the crib,,but you tell her,n"Don't climb out of the crib. OK?",And every parent knowsnwhat's going to happen.,Some of those babiesnare going to climb out of the crib.,Right? That's the differencenbetween ability and permission.,Well, the same thing is truenwith the government today.,It used to be that our governmentndidn't have the ability,to do widespread, massive surveillancenon hundreds of millions of Americans,and then abuse that information.,But now our government has grown up,,and we have that technology today.,The government has the ability,,and that means the lawnis more important than ever before.,The law is supposed to say,when the governmentnhas permission to do it,,and it's supposed to ensurenthat there's some kind of ramification.,We notice when those laws are broken,and there's some of kind ofnramification or punishment.,The law is more important than evernbecause we are now living in a world,where only rulesnare stopping the government,from abusing this information. 
 But the law has fallen down on the job.,Particularly since September 11nthe law has fallen down on the job,,and we do not haventhe rules in place that we need.,And we are seeingnthe ramifications of that.,So fusion centersnare these joint task forces,between local, statenand federal government,that are meant to ferret outndomestic terrorism.,And what we've seennis fusion center reports,that say that you might be dangerous,if you voted for a third-party candidate,,or you own a "Don't Tread On Me" flag,,or you watched movies that are anti-tax.,These same fusion centers have spiednon Muslim community groups' reading lists,and on Quakers who are resistingnmilitary recruiting in high schools.,The Internal Revenue Servicenhas disproportionately audited,groups that have "Tea Party"nor "Patriot" in their name.,And now customs and border patrol,is stopping peoplenas they come into the country,and demanding our socialnnetworking passwords,which will allow themnto see who our friends are,,what we say,and even to impersonate us online. 
 Now, civil libertarians like myself,have been trying to drawnpeople's attention to these things,and fighting against them for years.,This was a huge problemnduring the Obama administration,,but now the problem is worse.,When the New York Police Department,spies on Muslims,or a police departmentnuses license plate detectors,to find out wherenthe officers' spouses are,or those sorts of things,,that is extremely dangerous.,But when a president repurposes the power,of federal surveillancenand the federal government,to retaliate against political opposition,,that is a tyranny.,And so we are all activists now,,and we all have somethingnto fear from surveillance.,But just like in the timenof Dr. Martin Luther King,,we can reform the way things are. 
 First of all, use encryption.,Encryption protects your information,from being inexpensivelynand opportunistically collected.,It rolls back the golden agenfor surveillance. 
 Second, support surveillance reform.,Did you know that if you have a friend,who works for the Frenchnor German governments,or for an international human rights group,or for a global oil company,that your friend is a validnforeign intelligence target?,And what that means is that whennyou have conversations with that friend,,the US governmentnmay be collecting that information.,And when that information is collected,,even though it'snconversations with Americans,,it can then be funneled to the FBI,where the FBI is allowednto search through it,without getting a warrant,,without probable cause,,looking for information about Americans,and whatever crimes we may have committed,with no need to documentnany kind of suspicion.,The law that allows some of this to happen,is called Section 702nof the FISA Amendments Act,,and we have a great opportunity this year,,because Section 702nis going to expire at the end of 2017,,which means thatnCongress's inertia is on our side,if we want reform.,And we can pressure our representatives,to actually implementnimportant reforms to this law,and protect our datanfrom this redirection and misuse. 
 And finally, one of the reasonsnwhy things have gotten so out of control,is because so muchnof what happens with surveillance --,the technology, the enabling rulesnand the policies,that are either therenor not there to protect us --,are secret or classified.,We need transparency,nand we need to know as Americans,what the government is doing in our name,so that the surveillance that takes placenand the use of that information,is democratically accounted for. 
 We are all activists now,,which means that we all have somethingnto worry about from surveillance.,But like in the timenof Dr. Martin Luther King,,there is stuff that we can do about it.,So please join me, and let's get to work. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So, a few years ago I heardnan interesting rumor.,Apparently, the headnof a large pet food company,would go into the annualnshareholder's meeting,with can of dog food.,And he would eat the can of dog food.,And this was his way of convincing themnthat if it was good enough for him,,it was good enough for their pets.,This strategy is now knownnas "dogfooding,",and it's a common strategynin the business world.,It doesn't mean everyonengoes in and eats dog food,,but businesspeoplenwill use their own products,to demonstrate that they feel --,that they're confident in them.,Now, this is a widespread practice,,but I think what's really interestingnis when you find exceptions,to this rule,,when you find cases of businessesnor people in businesses,who don't use their own products.,Turns out there's one industrynwhere this happens in a common way,,in a pretty regular way,,and that is the screen-basedntech industry. 
 So, in 2010, Steve Jobs,nwhen he was releasing the iPad,,described the iPad as a devicenthat was "extraordinary.","The best browsing experiencenyou've ever had;,way better than a laptop,nway better than a smartphone.,It's an incredible experience.",A couple of months later,nhe was approached by a journalist,from the New York Times,,and they had a long phone call.,At the end of the call,,the journalist threw in a questionnthat seemed like a sort of softball.,He said to him, "Your kidsnmust love the iPad.",There's an obvious answer to this,,but what Jobs saidnreally staggered the journalist.,He was very surprised,,because he said, "They haven't used it.,We limit how much technologynour kids use at home." 
 This is a very common thingnin the tech world.,In fact, there's a schoolnquite near Silicon Valley,called the Waldorf Schoolnof the Peninsula,,and they don't introduce screensnuntil the eighth grade.,What's really interesting about the school,is that 75 percentnof the kids who go there,have parents who are high-levelnSilicon Valley tech execs.,So when I heard about this, I thoughtnit was interesting and surprising,,and it pushed me to considernwhat screens were doing to me,and to my family and the people I loved,,and to people at large. 
 So for the last five years,,as a professor of business and psychology,,I've been studying the effectnof screens on our lives.,And I want to start by just focusingnon how much time they take from us,,and then we can talk aboutnwhat that time looks like.,What I'm showing you herenis the average 24-hour workday,at three different points in history:,2007 -- 10 years ago --,2015,and then data that I collected,nactually, only last week.,And a lot of things haven't changed,all that much.,We sleep roughly seven-and-a-halfnto eight hours a day;,some people say that's declined slightly,nbut it hasn't changed much.,We work eight-and-a-halfnto nine hours a day.,We engage in survival activities --,these are things like eatingnand bathing and looking after kids --,about three hours a day. 
 That leaves this white space.,That's our personal time.,That space is incredibly important to us.,That's the space where we do thingsnthat make us individuals.,That's where hobbies happen,nwhere we have close relationships,,where we really think about our lives,nwhere we get creative,,where we zoom back and try to work out,whether our lives have been meaningful.,We get some of that from work as well,,but when people look back on their lives,and wonder what their lives have been like,at the end of their lives,,you look at the last things they say --,they are talking about those momentsnthat happen in that white personal space.,So it's sacred; it's important to us. 
 Now, what I'm going to do is show you,how much of that spacenis taken up by screens across time.,In 2007,,this much.,That was the year that Applenintroduced the first iPhone.,Eight years later,,this much.,Now, this much.,That's how much time we spendnof that free time in front of our screens.,This yellow area, this thin sliver,nis where the magic happens.,That's where your humanity lives.,And right now, it's in a very small box. 
 So what do we do about this?,Well, the first question is:,What does that red space look like?,Now, of course, screens are miraculous,in a lot of ways.,I live in New York,,a lot of my family lives in Australia,,and I have a one-year-old son.,The way I've been able to introducenthem to him is with screens.,I couldn't have done thatn15 or 20 years ago,in quite the same way.,So there's a lot of goodnthat comes from them. 
 One thing you can do is ask yourself:,What goes on during that time?,How enriching are the appsnthat we're using?,And some are enriching.,If you stop people whilenthey're using them and say,,"Tell us how you feel right now,",they say they feel pretty goodnabout these apps --,those that focus on relaxation,nexercise, weather, reading,,education and health.,They spend an average of ninenminutes a day on each of these.,These apps make them much less happy.,About half the people, when you interruptnthem and say, "How do you feel?",say they don't feel good about using them.,What's interesting about these --,dating, social networking, gaming,,entertainment, news, web browsing --,people spend 27 minutes a daynon each of these.,We're spending three times longernon the apps that don't make us happy.,That doesn't seem very wise. 
 One of the reasons we spendnso much time on these apps,that make us unhappy,is they rob us of stopping cues.,Stopping cues were everywherenin the 20th century.,They were baked into everything we did.,A stopping cue is basically a signalnthat it's time to move on,,to do something new,nto do something different.,And -- think about newspapers;neventually you get to the end,,you fold the newspaper away,nyou put it aside.,The same with magazines, books --nyou get to the end of a chapter,,prompts you to considernwhether you want to continue.,You watched a show on TV,neventually the show would end,,and then you'd have a weeknuntil the next one came.,There were stopping cues everywhere.,But the way we consume media todaynis such that there are no stopping cues.,The news feed just rolls on,,and everything's bottomless:nTwitter, Facebook, Instagram,,email, text messaging, the news.,And when you do checknall sorts of other sources,,you can just keep going on and on and on. 
 So, we can get a cue about what to donfrom Western Europe,,where they seem to have a numbernof pretty good ideas in the workplace.,Here's one example.nThis is a Dutch design firm.,And what they've donenis rigged the desks to the ceiling.,And at 6pm every day,,it doesn't matter who you're emailingnor what you're doing,,the desks rise to the ceiling. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Four days a week, the spacenturns into a yoga studio,,one day a week, into a dance club.,It's really up to you which onesnyou stick around for.,But this is a great stopping rule,,because it means at the end of the day,,everything stops, there's no way to work.,At Daimler, the German car company,nthey've got another great strategy.,When you go on vacation,,instead of saying,n"This person's on vacation,,they'll get back to you eventually,",they say, "This person's on vacation,nso we've deleted your email.,This person will never seenthe email you just sent." 
 (Laughter) 
 "You can email back in a couple of weeks,,or you can email someone else." 
 (Laughter) 
 And so -- 
 (Applause) 
 You can imagine what that's like.,You go on vacation,nand you're actually on vacation.,The people who work at this company feel,that they actually get a break from work. 
 But of course, that doesn't tell us much,about what we should donat home in our own lives,,so I want to make some suggestions.,It's easy to say, between 5 and 6pm,nI'm going to not use my phone.,The problem is, 5 and 6pmnlooks different on different days.,I think a far better strategy is to say,,I do certain things every day,,there are certain occasionsnthat happen every day,,like eating dinner.,Sometimes I'll be alone,,sometimes with other people,,sometimes in a restaurant,,sometimes at home,,but the rule that I've adopted is:nI will never use my phone at the table.,It's far away,,as far away as possible.,Because we're really badnat resisting temptation.,But when you have a stopping cuenthat, every time dinner begins,,my phone goes far away,,you avoid temptation all together. 
 At first, it hurts.,I had massive FOMO. 
 (Laughter) 
 I struggled. 
 But what happens is, you get used to it.,You overcome the withdrawalnthe same way you would from a drug,,and what happens is, life becomesnmore colorful, richer,,more interesting --,you have better conversations.,You really connect with the peoplenwho are there with you.,I think it's a fantastic strategy,,and we know it works,nbecause when people do this --,and I've tracked a lot of peoplenwho have tried this --,it expands.,They feel so good about it,,they start doing it for the firstnhour of the day in the morning.,They start putting their phonesnon airplane mode on the weekend.,That way, your phone remains a camera,nbut it's no longer a phone.,It's a really powerful idea,,and we know people feel much betternabout their lives when they do this. 
 So what's the take home here?,Screens are miraculous;nI've already said that,,and I feel that it's true.,But the way we use them is a lot likendriving down a really fast, long road,,and you're in a car where the acceleratornis mashed to the floor,,it's kind of hardnto reach the brake pedal.,You've got a choice.,You can either glide by, past,nsay, the beautiful ocean scenes,and take snaps out the window --nthat's the easy thing to do --,or you can go out of your waynto move the car to the side of the road,,to push that brake pedal,,to get out,,take off your shoes and socks,,take a couple of steps onto the sand,,feel what the sand feels likenunder your feet,,walk to the ocean,,and let the ocean lap at your ankles.,Your life will be richernand more meaningful,because you breathe in that experience,,and because you've leftnyour phone in the car. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I visit the future for a living.,Not just one future,,but many possible futures,,bringing back evidences from those futuresnfor you to experience today.,Like an archaeologist of the future.,Over the years, my many journeysnhave brought back things,like a new speciesnof synthetically engineered bees;,a book named, "Pets as Protein;",a machine that makes you richnby trading your genetic data;,a lamp powered by sugar;,a computer for growing food. 
 OK, so I don't actually travelnto different futures -- yet.,But my husband Jon and I spendna lot of time thinking,and creating visionsnof different futures in our studio.,We are constantly looking outnfor weak signals,,those murmurs of future potential.,Then we trace those threads of potentialnout into the future, asking:,What might it feel likento live in this future?,What might we see, hear and even breathe?,Then we run experiments,nbuild prototypes, make objects,,bringing aspects of these futures to life,,making them concrete and tangible,so you can really feel the impactnof those future possibilities,here and now.,But this work is not about predictions.,It's about creating tools --,tools that can help connectnour present and our future selves,so we become active participantsnin creating a future we want --,a future that works for all. 
 So how do we go about doing this?,For a recent project called Drone Aviary,,we were interested in exploring,what it would mean to livenwith drones in our cities.,Drones that have the powernto see things we can't,,to go places we can't,and to do so with increasing autonomy.,But to understand the technology,,getting our hands dirty was crucial.,So we built several differentndrones in our studio.,We gave them names, functionsnand then flew them --,but not without difficulty.,Things came loose,,GPS signals glitched,and drones crashed.,But it was through such experimentation,that we could construct a verynconcrete and very experiential slice,of one possible future. 
 So now, let's go to that future.,Let's imagine we are living in a citynwith drones like this one.,We call it The Nightwatchman.,It patrols the streets, often spottednin the evenings and at night.,Initially, many of us were annoyednby its low, dull hum.,But then, like everything else,nwe got used to it.,Now, what if you could seenthe world through its eyes?,See how it constantly logsnevery resident of our neighborhood;,logging the kids who play footballnin the no-ballgame area,and marking them as statutory nuisances. 
 (Laughter) 
 And then see how it dispersesnthis other group, who are teenagers,,with the threat of an autonomouslynissued injunction.,And then there's this giantnfloating disc called Madison.,Its glaring presence is so overpowering,,I can't help but stare at it.,But if feels like each time I look at it,,it knows a little more about me --,like it keeps flashing all thesenBrianair adverts at me,,as if it knows aboutnthe holiday I'm planning.,I'm not sure if I find thisnmildly entertaining,or just entirely invasive. 
 Back to the present.,In creating this future, we learned a lot.,Not just about how these machines work,,but what it would feel likento live alongside them.,Whilst drones like Madisonnand Nightwatchman,,in these particular forms,,are not real yet,,most elements of a drone futurenare in fact very real today.,For instance,,facial recognition systemsnare everywhere --,in our phones, even in our thermostats,and in cameras around our cities --,keeping a record of everything we do,,whether it's an advertisementnwe glanced at or a protest we attended.,These things are here,,and we often don't understandnhow they work,,and what their consequences could be.,And we see this all around us.,This difficulty in even imagining,how the consequences of our actionsntoday will affect our future. 
 Last year, where I live, in the UK,nthere was a referendum,where the people could votenfor the UK to leave the EU,or stay in the EU,,popularly known as "Brexit.",And soon after the results came out,,a word began to surfacencalled "Bregret" -- 
 (Laughter) 
 describing people who chose to votenfor Brexit as a protest,,but without thinking throughnits potential consequences.,And this disconnect is evidentnin some of the simplest things.,Say you go out for a quick drink.,Then you decidenyou wouldn't mind a few more.,You know you'll wake upnin the morning feeling awful,,but you justify it by saying,,"The other me in the futurenwill deal with that.",But as we find out in the morning,,that future "you" is you. 
 When I was growing up in Indianin the late '70s and early '80s,,there was a feeling,that the future both needed tonand could actually be planned.,I remember my parents had to plannfor some of the simplest things.,When they wanted a telephone in our house,,they needed to order it and then wait --,wait for nearly five years beforenit got installed in our house. 
 (Laughter) 
 And then if they wanted to callnmy grandparents who lived in another city,,they needed to booknsomething called a "trunk call,",and then wait again,nfor hours or even days.,And then abruptly, the phonenwould ring at two in the morning,,and all of us would jump out of our bedsnand gather round the phone,,shrieking into it,ndiscussing general well-being,at two in the morning. 
 Today it can feel like thingsnare happening too fast --,so fast, that it cannbecome really difficult,for us to form an understandingnof our place in history.,It creates an overwhelming sensenof uncertainty and anxiety,,and so, we let the futurenjust happen to us.,We don't connect with that future "us.",We treat our future selves as a stranger,,and the future as a foreign land.,It's not a foreign land;,it's unfolding right in front of us,,continually being shapednby our actions today.,We are that future,,and so I believe fightingnfor a future we want,is more urgent and necessarynthan ever before. 
 We have learned in our work,that one of the most powerful meansnof effecting change,is when people can directly, tangiblynand emotionally experience,some of the future consequencesnof their actions today.,Earlier this year, the governmentnof the United Arab Emirates invited us,to help them shapentheir country's energy strategy,all the way up to 2050.,Based on the government's econometricndata, we created this large city model,,and visualized manynpossible futures on it.,As I was excitably taking a groupnof government officials,and members of energy companies,through one sustainablenfuture on our model,,one of the participants told me,,"I cannot imagine that in the futurenpeople will stop driving cars,and start using public transport.",And then he said,,"There's no way I can tell my own sonnto stop driving his car." 
 But we were prepared for this reaction.,Working with scientists in a chemistry labnin my home city in India,,we had created approximate samples,of what the air would be like in 2030nif our behavior stays the same.,And so, I walked the groupnover to this object,that emits vapor from those air samples.,Just one whiff of the noxiousnpolluted air from 2030,brought home the pointnthat no amount of data can.,This is not the future you would wantnyour children to inherit.,The next day, the governmentnmade a big announcement.,They would be investing billionsnof dollars in renewables.,We don't know what part our futurenexperiences played in this decision,,but we know that they've changedntheir energy policy,to mitigate such a scenario. 
 While something like air from the futurenis very effective and tangible,,the trajectory from our presentnto a future consequence,is not always so linear.,Even when a technologynis developed with utopian ideals,,the moment it leaves the laboratorynand enters the world,,it is subject to forces outsidenof the creators' control.,For one particular project,nwe investigated medical genomics:,the technology of gatheringnand using people's genetic data,to create personalized medicine.,We were asking:,What are some of the unintendednconsequences of linking our genetics,to health care?,To explore this question further,,we created a fictional lawsuit,,and brought it to life through 31 piecesnof carefully crafted evidence.,So we built an illegal genetic clinic,,a DIY carbon dioxide incubator,,and even bought frozen mice on eBay. 
 So now let's go to that futurenwhere this lawsuit is unfolding,,and meet the defendant, Arnold Mann.,Arnold is being prosecutednby this global giant biotech company,called Dynamic Genetics,,because they have evidence,that Arnold has illegally insertednthe company's patented genetic material,into his body.,How on earth did Arnold manage to do that?,Well, it all started,when Arnold was asked to submitna saliva sample in this spit kit,to the NHI --,the UK's National HealthnInsurance service.,When Arnold receivednhis health insurance bill,,he was shocked and scared,to see that his premiumsnhad gone through the roof,,beyond anything he or his familyncould ever afford. 
 The state's algorithm had scannednhis genetic data,and found the risk of a chronic healthncondition lurking in his DNA.,And so Arnold had to start payingntoward the potential costs,of that future disease --,potential future disease from today.,In that moment of fear and panic,,Arnold slipped through the city,into the dark shadowsnof this illegal clinic for treatment --,a treatment that would modify his DNA,so that the state's algorithmnwould no longer see him as a risk,,and his insurance premiumsnwould become affordable again.,But Arnold was caught.,And the legal proceedings in the casenDynamic Genetics v. Mann began. 
 In bringing such a future to life,,what was important to usnwas that people could actually touch,,see and feel its potential,,because such an immediate and closenencounter provokes people,to ask the right questions,,questions like:,What are the implicationsnof living in a world,where I'm judged on my genetics?,Or: Who might claim ownershipnto my genetic data,,and what might they do with it?,If this feels even slightlynout-there or farfetched,,today there's a little-known billnbeing passed through the American congress,known as HR 1313, PreservingnEmployee Wellness Programs Act.,This bill proposes to amend the GeneticnInformation Nondiscrimination Act,,popularly known as GINA,,and would allow employers to asknabout family medical history,and genetic data,to all employees for the first time.,Those who refusenwould face large penalties. 
 In the work I've shown so far,,whether it was drones or genetic crimes,,these stories describe troubling futures,with the intention of helping usnavoid those futures.,But what about what we can't avoid?,Today, especially with climate change,,it looks like we are heading for trouble.,And so what we want to do nownis to prepare for that future,by developing tools and attitudesnthat can help us find hope --,hope that can inspire action. 
 Currently, we are runningnan experiment in our studio.,It's a work in progress.,Based on climate data projections,,we are exploring a future,where the Western world has movednfrom abundance to scarcity.,We imagine living in a future citynwith repeated flooding,,periods with almostnno food in supermarkets,,economic instabilities,,broken supply chains.,What can we do to not just survive,nbut prosper in such a world?,What food can we eat? 
 To really step inside these questions,,we are building this room in a flatnin London from 2050.,It's like a little time capsulenthat we reclaimed from the future.,We stripped it down to the bare minimum.,Everything we lovingly put in our homes,,like flat-panel TVs,,internet-connected fridges,and artisanal furnishings,all had to go.,And in its place,nwe're building food computers,from abandoned, salvagednand repurposed materials,,turning today's wasteninto tomorrow's dinner.,For instance,,we've just finished building our firstnfully automated fogponics machine.,It uses the technique of fogponics --nso just fog as a nutrient,,not even water or soil --,to grow things quickly.,At the moment,,we have successfully grown tomatoes.,But we'll need more food than whatnwe can grow in this small room.,So what else could we foragenfrom the city?,Insects? Pigeons? Foxes? 
 Earlier, we brought backnair from the future.,This time we are bringingnan entire room from the future,,a room full of hope, tools and tactics,to create positive actionnin hostile conditions.,Spending time in this room,,a room that could be our own future home,,makes the consequencesnof climate change and food insecurity,much more immediate and tangible. 
 What we're learning through suchnexperiments and our practice,and the people we engage with,is that creating concrete experiences,can bridge the disconnectnbetween today and tomorrow.,By putting ourselvesninto different possible futures,,by becoming open and willing,to embrace the uncertainty and discomfortnthat such an act can bring,,we have the opportunitynto imagine new possibilities.,We can find optimistic futures;,we can find paths forward;,we can move beyond hope into action.,It means we have the chancento change direction,,a chance to have our voices heard,,a chance to write ourselvesninto a future we want.,Other worlds are possible. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)The philosopher Plato once said,,"Music gives a soul to the universe,,wings to the mind,,flight to the imagination,and life to everything.",Music has always beenna big part of my life.,To create and to perform music,connects you to peoplencountries and lifetimes away.,It connects you to the peoplenyou're playing with,,to your audience,and to yourself.,When I'm happy, when I'm sad,,when I'm bored, when I'm stressed,,I listen to and I create music. 
 When I was younger, I played piano;,later, I took up guitar.,And as I started high school,,music became a part of my identity.,I was in every band,,I was involved with everynmusical fine arts event.,Music surrounded me.,It made me who I was,,and it gave me a place to belong. 
 Now, I've always hadnthis thing with rhythms.,I remember being young,,I would walk downnthe hallways of my school,and I would tap rhythms to myselfnon my leg with my hands,,or tapping my teeth.,It was a nervous habit,,and I was always nervous.,I think I liked the repetitionnof the rhythm --,it was calming. 
 Then in high school,,I started music theory,,and it was the best class I've ever taken.,We were learning about music --,things I didn't know,nlike theory and history.,It was a class where we basicallynjust listened to a song,,talked about what it meant to us,and analyzed it,,and figured out what made it tick.,Every Wednesday, we did somethingncalled "rhythmic dictation,",and I was pretty good at it.,Our teacher would give usnan amount of measures,and a time signature,,and then he would speak a rhythm to us,and we would have to write it downnwith the proper rests and notes.,Like this:,ta ta tuck-a tuck-a ta,,ta tuck-a-tuck-a-tuck-a, tuck-a.,And I loved it.,The simplicity of the rhythm --,a basic two- to four- measure line --,and yet each of them almost told a story,,like they had so much potential,,and all you had to do was add a melody. 
 (Guitar) 
 Rhythms set a foundation for melodiesnand harmonies to play on top of.,It gives structure and stability.,Now, music has these parts --,rhythm, melody and harmony --,just like our lives.,Where music has rhythm,,we have routines and habits --,things that help us to remembernwhat to do and to stay on track,,and to just keep going.,And you may not notice it,,but it's always there. 
 (Guitar) 
 And it may seem simple,,it may seem dull by itself,,but it gives tempo and heartbeat.,And then things in your life add on to it,,giving texture --,that's your friends and your family,,and anything that createsna harmonic structure in your life,and in your song,,like harmonies,,cadences,and anything that makes it polyphonic.,And they create beautifulnchords and patterns. 
 (Guitar) 
 And then there's you.,You play on top of everything else,,on top of the rhythms and the beat,because you're the melody.,And things may change and develop,,but no matter what we do,,we're still the same people.,Throughout a song melodies develop,,but it's still the same song.,No matter what you do,,the rhythms are still there:,the tempo and the heartbeat ...,until I left,,and I went to college,and everything disappeared. 
 When I first arrived at university,,I felt lost.,And don't get me wrong --nsometimes I loved it and it was great,,but other times,,I felt like I had been left alone,to fend for myself.,It's like I had been taken outnof my natural environment,,and put somewhere new,,where the rhythms and the harmonies,and the form had gone away,,and it was just me -- 
 (Guitar) 
 silence and my melody.,And even that began to waver,,because I didn't know what I was doing.,I didn't have any chordsnto structure myself,,or a rhythm,or a beat to know the tempo. 
 (Guitar) 
 And then I began to hearnall these other sounds. 
 (Guitar) 
 And they were off-time,and off-key.,And the more I was around them,,the more my melody startednto sound like theirs.,And slowly I began to lose myself,,like I was being washed away.,But then the next moment -- 
 (Guitar) 
 I could hear it.,And I could feel it.,And it was me.,And I was here.,And it was different,,but not worse off.,Just changed a little. 
 Music is my way of copingnwith the changes in my life.,There's a beautiful connectionnbetween music and life.,It can bind us to reality,at the same timenit allows us to escape it.,Music is somethingnthat lives inside of you.,You create it and you're created by it.,Our lives are not only conducted by music,,they're also composed of it. 
 So this may seem like a bit of a stretch,,but hear me out:,music is a fundamental part of what we are,and of everything around us.,Now, music is my passion,,but physics also used to benan interest of mine.,And the more I learned,,the more I saw connectionsnbetween the two --,especially regarding string theory.,I know this is only one of many theories,,but it spoke to me.,So, one aspect of string theory,nat its simplest form, is this:,matter is made up of atoms,,which are made up of protonsnand neutrons and electrons,,which are made up of quark.,And here's where the string part comes in.,This quark is supposedly made upnof little coiled strings,,and it's the vibrations of these stringsnthat make everything what it is. 
 Michio Kaku once explained this,in a lecture called,n"The Universe in a Nutshell,",where he says,,"String theory is the simple idea,that the four forces of the universe --,gravity, the electromagnetic force,nand the two strong forces --,can be viewed as music.,The music of tiny little rubber bands.",In this lecture, he goes onnto explain physics,as the laws of harmonynbetween these strings;,chemistry, as the melodiesnyou can play on these strings;,and he states that the universenis a "symphony of strings.",These strings dictate the universe;,they make up everything we seenand everything we know.,They're musical notes,,but they make us what we arenand they hold us together.,So you see,,everything is music. 
 (Guitar) 
 When I look at the world,,I see music all around us.,When I look at myself,,I see music.,And my life has been defined by music.,I found myself through music.,Music is everywhere,,and it is in everything.,And it changes and it builds,and it diminishes.,But it's always there,,supporting us,,connecting us to each other,and showing us the beauty of the universe. 
 So if you ever feel lost,,stop and listen for your song. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Just over a year ago,,for the third time in my life,nI ceased to exist.,I was having a small operation,nand my brain was filling with anesthetic.,I remember a sensenof detachment and falling apart,and a coldness.,And then I was back,ndrowsy and disoriented,,but definitely there.,Now, when you wake from a deep sleep,,you might feel confused about the timenor anxious about oversleeping,,but there's always a basic sensenof time having passed,,of a continuity between then and now.,Coming round fromnanesthesia is very different.,I could have been undernfor five minutes, five hours,,five years or even 50 years.,I simply wasn't there.,It was total oblivion.,Anesthesia --nit's a modern kind of magic.,It turns people into objects,,and then, we hope, back again into people.,And in this process,is one of the greatest remainingnmysteries in science and philosophy. 
 How does consciousness happen?,Somehow, within each of our brains,,the combined activitynof many billions of neurons,,each one a tiny biological machine,,is generating a conscious experience.,And not just any conscious experience --,your conscious experiencenright here and right now.,How does this happen? 
 Answering this question is so important,because consciousnessnfor each of us is all there is.,Without it there's no world,,there's no self,,there's nothing at all.,And when we suffer, we suffer consciously,whether it's throughnmental illness or pain.,And if we can experiencenjoy and suffering,,what about other animals?,Might they be conscious, too?,Do they also have a sense of self?,And as computers get faster and smarter,,maybe there will come a point,nmaybe not too far away,,when my iPhone developsna sense of its own existence. 
 I actually think the prospectsnfor a conscious AI are pretty remote.,And I think this becausenmy research is telling me,that consciousness has less to donwith pure intelligence,and more to do with our naturenas living and breathing organisms.,Consciousness and intelligencenare very different things.,You don't have to be smart to suffer,nbut you probably do have to be alive. 
 In the story I'm going to tell you,,our conscious experiencesnof the world around us,,and of ourselves within it,,are kinds of controlled hallucinations,that happen with, throughnand because of our living bodies. 
 Now, you might have heardnthat we know nothing,about how the brain and bodyngive rise to consciousness.,Some people even say it's beyondnthe reach of science altogether.,But in fact,,the last 25 years have seen an explosionnof scientific work in this area.,If you come to my labnat the University of Sussex,,you'll find scientistsnfrom all different disciplines,and sometimes even philosophers.,All of us together trying to understandnhow consciousness happens,and what happens when it goes wrong.,And the strategy is very simple.,I'd like you to think about consciousness,in the way that we'vencome to think about life.,At one time, people thoughtnthe property of being alive,could not be explainednby physics and chemistry --,that life had to benmore than just mechanism.,But people no longer think that.,As biologists got on with the job,of explaining the propertiesnof living systems,in terms of physics and chemistry --,things like metabolism,nreproduction, homeostasis --,the basic mystery of what life isnstarted to fade away,,and people didn't proposenany more magical solutions,,like a force of life or an élan vital.,So as with life, so with consciousness.,Once we start explaining its properties,in terms of things happeningninside brains and bodies,,the apparently insoluble mysterynof what consciousness is,should start to fade away.,At least that's the plan. 
 So let's get started.,What are the properties of consciousness?,What should a sciencenof consciousness try to explain?,Well, for today I'd just like to thinknof consciousness in two different ways.,There are experiencesnof the world around us,,full of sights, sounds and smells,,there's multisensory, panoramic,n3D, fully immersive inner movie.,And then there's conscious self.,The specific experiencenof being you or being me.,The lead character in this inner movie,,and probably the aspect of consciousnessnwe all cling to most tightly.,Let's start with experiencesnof the world around us,,and with the important ideanof the brain as a prediction engine. 
 Imagine being a brain.,You're locked inside a bony skull,,trying to figurenwhat's out there in the world.,There's no lights inside the skull.nThere's no sound either.,All you've got to go onnis streams of electrical impulses,which are only indirectly relatednto things in the world,,whatever they may be.,So perception --nfiguring out what's there --,has to be a process of informed guesswork,in which the brain combinesnthese sensory signals,with its prior expectations or beliefsnabout the way the world is,to form its best guessnof what caused those signals.,The brain doesn't hear sound or see light.,What we perceive is its best guessnof what's out there in the world. 
 Let me give you a couplenof examples of all this.,You might have seen this illusion before,,but I'd like you to thinknabout it in a new way.,If you look at those two patches, A and B,,they should look to you to benvery different shades of gray, right?,But they are in factnexactly the same shade.,And I can illustrate this.,If I put up a second versionnof the image here,and join the two patchesnwith a gray-colored bar,,you can see there's no difference.,It's exactly the same shade of gray.,And if you still don't believe me,,I'll bring the bar acrossnand join them up.,It's a single colored block of gray,nthere's no difference at all.,This isn't any kind of magic trick.,It's the same shade of gray,,but take it away again,nand it looks different.,So what's happening here,is that the brainnis using its prior expectations,built deeply into the circuitsnof the visual cortex,that a cast shadow dimsnthe appearance of a surface,,so that we see B as lighternthan it really is. 
 Here's one more example,,which shows just how quicklynthe brain can use new predictions,to change what we consciously experience.,Have a listen to this. 
 (Distorted voice) 
 Sounded strange, right?,Have a listen againnand see if you can get anything. 
 (Distorted voice) 
 Still strange.,Now listen to this. 
 (Recording) Anil Seth: I think Brexitnis a really terrible idea. 
 (Laughter) 
 Which I do. 
 So you heard some words there, right?,Now listen to the first sound again.nI'm just going to replay it. 
 (Distorted voice) 
 Yeah? So you can now hear words there.,Once more for luck. 
 (Distorted voice) 
 OK, so what's going on here?,The remarkable thing is the sensoryninformation coming into the brain,hasn't changed at all.,All that's changednis your brain's best guess,of the causes of that sensory information.,And that changesnwhat you consciously hear.,All this puts the brainnbasis of perception,in a bit of a different light.,Instead of perception depending largelynon signals coming into the brain,from the outside world,,it depends as much, if not more,,on perceptual predictionsnflowing in the opposite direction.,We don't just passivelynperceive the world,,we actively generate it.,The world we experiencencomes as much, if not more,,from the inside out,as from the outside in. 
 Let me give younone more example of perception,as this active, constructive process.,Here we've combined immersivenvirtual reality with image processing,to simulate the effectsnof overly strong perceptual predictions,on experience.,In this panoramic video,nwe've transformed the world --,which is in this case Sussex campus --,into a psychedelic playground.,We've processed the footage usingnan algorithm based on Google's Deep Dream,to simulate the effectsnof overly strong perceptual predictions.,In this case, to see dogs.,And you can seenthis is a very strange thing.,When perceptualnpredictions are too strong,,as they are here,,the result looks very muchnlike the kinds of hallucinations,people might report in altered states,,or perhaps even in psychosis. 
 Now, think about this for a minute.,If hallucination is a kindnof uncontrolled perception,,then perception right here and right nownis also a kind of hallucination,,but a controlled hallucination,in which the brain's predictionsnare being reigned in,by sensory information from the world.,In fact, we're allnhallucinating all the time,,including right now.,It's just that when we agreenabout our hallucinations,,we call that reality. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now I'm going to tell younthat your experience of being a self,,the specific experience of being you,,is also a controlled hallucinationngenerated by the brain.,This seems a very strange idea, right?,Yes, visual illusionsnmight deceive my eyes,,but how could I be deceivednabout what it means to be me?,For most of us,,the experience of being a person,is so familiar, so unifiednand so continuous,that it's difficultnnot to take it for granted.,But we shouldn't take it for granted.,There are in fact many different waysnwe experience being a self.,There's the experience of having a body,and of being a body.,There are experiencesnof perceiving the world,from a first person point of view.,There are experiencesnof intending to do things,and of being the cause of thingsnthat happen in the world.,And there are experiences,of being a continuousnand distinctive person over time,,built from a rich setnof memories and social interactions. 
 Many experiments show,,and psychiatristsnand neurologists know very well,,that these different waysnin which we experience being a self,can all come apart.,What this means isnthe basic background experience,of being a unified self is a rathernfragile construction of the brain.,Another experience,nwhich just like all others,,requires explanation. 
 So let's return to the bodily self.,How does the brain generatenthe experience of being a body,and of having a body?,Well, just the same principles apply.,The brain makes its best guess,about what is and what is notnpart of its body.,And there's a beautiful experimentnin neuroscience to illustrate this.,And unlike most neuroscience experiments,,this is one you can do at home.,All you need is one of these. 
 (Laughter) 
 And a couple of paintbrushes. 
 In the rubber hand illusion,,a person's real hand is hidden from view,,and that fake rubber handnis placed in front of them.,Then both hands are simultaneouslynstroked with a paintbrush,while the person stares at the fake hand.,Now, for most people, after a while,,this leads to the very uncanny sensation,that the fake handnis in fact part of their body.,And the idea is that the congruencenbetween seeing touch and feeling touch,on an object that looks like handnand is roughly where a hand should be,,is enough evidence for the brainnto make its best guess,that the fake handnis in fact part of the body. 
 (Laughter) 
 So you can measurenall kinds of clever things.,You can measure skin conductancenand startle responses,,but there's no need.,It's clear the guy in bluenhas assimilated the fake hand.,This means that even experiencesnof what our body is,is a kind of best guessing --,a kind of controllednhallucination by the brain. 
 There's one more thing.,We don't just experience our bodiesnas objects in the world from the outside,,we also experience them from within.,We all experience the sensenof being a body from the inside.,And sensory signalsncoming from the inside of the body,are continually telling the brainnabout the state of the internal organs,,how the heart is doing,nwhat the blood pressure is like,,lots of things.,This kind of perception,nwhich we call interoception,,is rather overlooked.,But it's critically important,because perception and regulationnof the internal state of the body --,well, that's what keeps us alive. 
 Here's another versionnof the rubber hand illusion.,This is from our lab at Sussex.,And here, people seena virtual reality version of their hand,,which flashes red and back,either in time or out of timenwith their heartbeat.,And when it's flashingnin time with their heartbeat,,people have a stronger sensenthat it's in fact part of their body.,So experiences of having a bodynare deeply grounded,in perceiving our bodies from within. 
 There's one last thingnI want to draw your attention to,,which is that experiences of the bodynfrom the inside are very different,from experiences of the world around us.,When I look around me,nthe world seems full of objects --,tables, chairs, rubber hands,,people, you lot --,even my own body in the world,,I can perceive itnas an object from the outside.,But my experiencesnof the body from within,,they're not like that at all.,I don't perceive my kidneys here,,my liver here,,my spleen ...,I don't know where my spleen is,,but it's somewhere.,I don't perceive my insides as objects.,In fact, I don't experience themnmuch at all unless they go wrong.,And this is important, I think.,Perception of the internalnstate of the body,isn't about figuring out what's there,,it's about control and regulation --,keeping the physiological variablesnwithin the tight bounds,that are compatible with survival.,When the brain uses predictionsnto figure out what's there,,we perceive objectsnas the causes of sensations.,When the brain uses predictionsnto control and regulate things,,we experience how wellnor how badly that control is going. 
 So our most basic experiencesnof being a self,,of being an embodied organism,,are deeply grounded in the biologicalnmechanisms that keep us alive.,And when we follow this ideanall the way through,,we can start to seenthat all of our conscious experiences,,since they all depend on the samenmechanisms of predictive perception,,all stem from this basicndrive to stay alive.,We experience the world and ourselves,with, through and because ofnour living bodies. 
 Let me bring things together step-by-step.,What we consciously see depends,on the brain's best guessnof what's out there.,Our experienced worldncomes from the inside out,,not just the outside in.,The rubber hand illusion showsnthat this applies to our experiences,of what is and what is not our body.,And these self-related predictionsndepend critically on sensory signals,coming from deep inside the body.,And finally,,experiences of being an embodied selfnare more about control and regulation,than figuring out what's there.,So our experiences of the worldnaround us and ourselves within it --,well, they're kindsnof controlled hallucinations,that have been shapednover millions of years of evolution,to keep us alive in worldsnfull of danger and opportunity.,We predict ourselves into existence. 
 Now, I leave you with threenimplications of all this.,First, just as we cannmisperceive the world,,we can misperceive ourselves,when the mechanismsnof prediction go wrong.,Understanding this opens many newnopportunities in psychiatry and neurology,,because we can finallynget at the mechanisms,rather than just treating the symptoms,in conditions likendepression and schizophrenia. 
 Second:,what it means to be mencannot be reduced to or uploaded to,a software program running on a robot,,however smart or sophisticated.,We are biological, flesh-and-blood animals,whose conscious experiencesnare shaped at all levels,by the biological mechanismsnthat keep us alive.,Just making computers smarternis not going to make them sentient. 
 Finally,,our own individual inner universe,,our way of being conscious,,is just one possiblenway of being conscious.,And even human consciousness generally --,it's just a tiny region in a vast spacenof possible consciousnesses.,Our individual self and worldsnare unique to each of us,,but they're all groundednin biological mechanisms,shared with many other living creatures. 
 Now, these are fundamental changes,in how we understand ourselves,,but I think they should be celebrated,,because as so often in science,nfrom Copernicus --,we're not at the center of the universe --,to Darwin --,we're related to all other creatures --,to the present day.,With a greater sense of understanding,comes a greater sense of wonder,,and a greater realization,that we are part ofnand not apart from the rest of nature.,And ...,when the end of consciousness comes,,there's nothing to be afraid of.,Nothing at all. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)It was the end of Octobernin the mountains in Austria.,I was there on a field tripnwith my architecture students from Zurich.,And when we reached a high valley,,I surprised them with the newsnthat there was no hut,or hotel booked for the night.,It was not a mistake.,It was totally on purpose.,The challenge was to build our own shelternwith whatever we could find.,And we all survived.,It was cold, it was really tough ...,and it was a great learning experience,to discover that there are a lotnof resources given by nature for free,,and all that we neednis our sensitivity to see them ...,and our creativity to use them. 
 I found myself in a similar situation.,When I was an architecture studentnabout 13 years ago,,I went to Bangladeshnto a remote village called Rudrapur,with the aim to design and buildna school as my thesis project.,I had lived in that village beforenwhen I was 19 and a volunteer,at Dipshikha, a Bangladeshi NGOnfor rural development.,And what I had learned from them,was that the most sustainable strategynfor sustainable development,is to cherish and to usenyour very own resources and potential,,and not get dependent on external factors.,And this is what I tried to donwith my architecture as well. 
 In terms of suitable buildingnmaterials for my school,,I didn't have to look far.,They were right under my feet:,mud, earth, dirt, clay,nhowever you call it ...,and bamboo that was growing all around.,Electricity in remote Bangladesh is rare,,but we didn't need it.,We had human energy,and the people were happynto have the work.,Tools were an issue, too,,but we had these guys,,water buffalos.,We had also tried a bit cows,,but interestingly,nthey were too intelligent.,They were always steppingnin the holes of the previous round.,They wouldn't mix the mud, the straw -- 
 (Laughter) 
 the sand, which arenthe ingredients in the walls.,And except a small team of consultants,like my partnernfor realization, Eike Roswag,,and my basket-weaver cousin, Emmanuel,,it was all built by craftsmennfrom the village.,And this is the METI schoolnafter six months of construction. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Load-bearing earth wallsnthat really ground the school,,and large bamboo structuresnthat bring the lightness in.,That's the classroom on the ground floor.,Attached to it are the caves.,They're for reading,nfor snuggling, for solo work,,for meditation, for playing ...,and the classroom on the top. 
 The children all signednwith their names in Bengali the doors,,and they did not only sign,nthey also helped building the school.,And I'm sure you all had your handsnin mud or clay before.,It's wonderful to touch. I love it.,The children loved it.,And can you imagine the feelingnof a small boy or a girl,or an illiterate day laborer standingnin front of that school building,and knowing that you built this,out of the ordinary bamboonand just the dirt underneath your feet,,using nothing but your hands?,That gives such an enormous boostnof trust and confidence,in yourself and the community. 
 And in the material.,Especially mud has a very poor image.,When we think of mud, we think of dirt --,it's ugly, it's nondurable --,and this is the image I want to change.,In fact, it's the 11th rainy seasonnfor this school now,,really harsh, horizontal monsoon rains,,and the walls are standing strong. 
 (Applause) 
 So how does it work?,First rule, a good foundationnthat keeps the wall dry from the ground,,and second rule, a good roofnthat protects from the top,,and third rule, erosion control.,Mud walls need speed breakers,so that the rainwaterncannot run down the wall fast,,and these speed breakersncould be lines of bamboo,or stones or straw mixed into the mud,,just like a hill needs trees or rocksnin order to prevent erosion.,It works just the same way.,And people always ask menif I have to add cement to the mud,,and the answer is no.,There is no stabilizer,nno coating on these walls,,only in the foundation.,So this is the close-up of the wall,after 10 rainy seasons,,and as much as I grew a bit older,,the wall got some wrinkles as well.,The edges my not be as sharp as before,,but it still looks pretty good,,and if it needs repairing,,it is really easy to do.,You just take the broken part,,make it wet, and put it back on the wall,,and it will look the same as before.,Wish that would work on me, too. 
 (Laughter) 
 Yeah, and the great thing is,,if an earth wall is not needed anymore,,it can go back to the ground it came from,,turn into a garden,,or get fully recyclednwithout any loss of quality.,There's no other materialnthat can do this,,and this is why mud is so excellentnin terms of environmental performance. 
 What about the economic sustainability?,When we built the school,,I practically livednon the construction site,,and in the evening, I used to gonwith the workers to the market,,and I could seenhow they spent their money.,And they would buynthe vegetables from their neighbors,,they would get a new haircutnor a new blouse from the tailor.,And because the main partnof the building budget,was spent on craftsmanship,,the school wasn't just a building,,it became a real catalystnfor local development,,and that made me happy.,If I had designed the schoolnin cement and steel,,this money would have been exportednand lost for those families. 
 (Applause) 
 The building budget at that timenwas 35,000 euros --,it's probably doubled by now --,and this is a lot of moneynfor that region,,and especially because this moneynis working within the community,and rotating fast,,and not on the stock market.,So when it comes to the economicnsustainability of my project,,my main question is, who gets the profit? 
 How many of you in here,have some experiencenliving in a mud house?,Chris Anderson, where is your hand? 
 (Laughter) 
 You? OK. 
 Yeah.,It seems totally out of our focus,,but approximately three billion peoplenall around the planet,are living in earth houses,,and it is a traditional building material,in Europe just as much as in Africa. 
 Strangely enough,,mud is not considered worthynof being studied at universities ...,so I brought the dirt to Harvard, 
 (Laughter) 
 precisely 60 tons of dirtnright in front of the main facade,of the Graduate School of Design.,Students and facultynrolled up their sleeves,,got their hands dirty,and transformed the frontninto a warm place for people to gather.,Children would climb the structures,,skaters would ride the ramp,,students having lunch breaks,,and it was particularly fascinating to seenhow many people were touching the wall,,and we usually don't go around citiesncaressing our facades, right? 
 (Laughter) 
 (Laughter) 
 Of course, this was a small-scale project,,but in terms of awareness-buildingnand in terms of education,,it was like an acupuncture trigger point.,And in fact, in more and more countries,,load-bearing earthen structuresnare not allowed to be built anymore,although they're traditionalnand have lasted for hundreds of years,,and not because the material is weak,,but because there arenno architects and engineers,who know how to deal with that material.,So education on all levels,,for craftsmen, engineers and architects,,is really strongly needed.,Equally importantnis technological development,,like prefabrication developednby my colleague Martin Rauch,,who is an Austrian artistnand expert in earthen structures.,And he has created technologiesnfor rammed earth elements,,for prefabricationnof rammed earth elements,that include insulation,nwall heatings and coolings,and all sorts of electrical fittings,that can be layerednto multistoried buildings,,and this is important in order to scale up,and in order to fasten up the processes,,like in the Ricola Herb Centernin Switzerland. 
 And finally, we need good built projects,that prove you can buildnwith an ancient material,in a very modern way.,It is not a matternof how old a material is;,it's a matter of our creativenability to use it today.,These, for example, are three hostels,that I did in China in the village Baoxi,,about six hours by bus from Shanghai.,The outside shape is woven bamboo,,and the inside corenis stones and rammed earth.,And it is a traditional building material.,Even large partsnof the Great Wall of China,have been built with rammed earth,,but it's getting replaced by concrete. 
 And this trend is happening very fast.,Within only a couple of years,,China has consumed more cementnthan the United States,in the entire 20th century.,And this trend of replacingnnatural building materials,with materials that requirena lot of energy,,that are energy-intensive,,and that emit CO2,is really clearly contributingnto climate change.,And we have alternatives,,such as mud, stones, timber,nbamboo, earth,,that are totally effective optionsnfor all sorts of purposes. 
 This, for example,nis an office building that we did,for Omicron Electronics in Austria.,Mud is healthy for the planet,nbut also for the human bodies,,and the material is low-tech,,but the performance is high-tech.,The earth walls keep the highlynsophisticated tools in the building safe,by naturally regulating moisture. 
 And this wall in my own home,is our humidfier.,We love our six tons of dirt at home,not only becausenit's healthy and sustainable.,Its archaic warmthnis touching deep within. 
 My personal dream is to buildna mud skyscraper right in Manhattan. 
 (Laughter) 
 Yeah. 
 (Applause) 
 And this dream isn't so crazy,if you think of the mud citynof Shibam in Yemen,that was built in the 16th century,and has lasted now for 500 years.,What was possible that long agonis possible today as well,,and we can applynall our technical know-how,to these ancient materials,so that it meets our needs and our dreams. 
 All around us,,and just below our feet ...,are wonderful natural building materials.,Let's use them.,And I deeply believe,our homes, our work spaces, our cities,would become more healthy and sustainable,and more humane,and beautiful. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)My seven-year-old grandsonnsleeps just down the hall from me,,and he wakes up a lot of mornings,and he says,,"You know, this could benthe best day ever.",And other times,nin the middle of the night,,he calls out in a tremulous voice,,"Nana, will you ever get sick and die?" 
 I think this pretty much says it for menand most of the people I know,,that we're a mixed grillnof happy anticipation,and dread.,So I sat down a few daysnbefore my 61st birthday,,and I decided to compile a listnof everything I know for sure.,There's so little truthnin the popular culture,,and it's good to be sure of a few things. 
 For instance, I am no longer 47,,although this is the age I feel,,and the age I like to thinknof myself as being.,My friend Paul used to say in his late 70s,that he felt like a young mannwith something really wrong with him. 
 (Laughter) 
 Our true person is outsidenof time and space,,but looking at the paperwork,,I can, in fact, seenthat I was born in 1954.,My inside self is outsidenof time and space.,It doesn't have an age.,I'm every age I've ever been,nand so are you,,although I can't helpnmentioning as an aside,that it might have been helpfulnif I hadn't followed,the skin care rules of the '60s,,which involved gettingnas much sun as possible,while slathered in baby oil,and basking in the glownof a tinfoil reflector shield. 
 (Laughter) 
 It was so liberating, though,nto face the truth,that I was no longernin the last throes of middle age,,that I decided to write downnevery single true thing I know.,People feel really doomednand overwhelmed these days,,and they keep asking me what's true.,So I hope that my list of thingsnI'm almost positive about,might offer some basicnoperating instructions,to anyone who is feelingnreally overwhelmed or beleaguered. 
 Number one:,the first and truest thingnis that all truth is a paradox.,Life is both a precious,nunfathomably beautiful gift,,and it's impossible here,non the incarnational side of things.,It's been a very bad match,for those of us who were bornnextremely sensitive.,It's so hard and weirdnthat we sometimes wonder,if we're being punked.,It's filled simultaneouslynwith heartbreaking sweetness and beauty,,desperate poverty,,floods and babies and acne and Mozart,,all swirled together.,I don't think it's an ideal system. 
 (Laughter) 
 Number two: almostneverything will work again,if you unplug it for a few minutes -- 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 including you. 
 Three: there is almostnnothing outside of you,that will help in any kind of lasting way,,unless you're waiting for an organ.,You can't buy, achieve or datenserenity and peace of mind.,This is the most horrible truth,nand I so resent it.,But it's an inside job,,and we can't arrange peacenor lasting improvement,for the people we love most in the world.,They have to find their own ways,,their own answers.,You can't run alongsidenyour grown children,with sunscreen and ChapSticknon their hero's journey.,You have to release them.,It's disrespectful not to.,And if it's someone else's problem,,you probably don't haventhe answer, anyway. 
 (Laughter) 
 Our help is usually not very helpful.,Our help is often toxic.,And help is the sunny side of control.,Stop helping so much.,Don't get your help and goodnessnall over everybody. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 This brings us to number four:,everyone is screwed up,nbroken, clingy and scared,,even the people who seemnto have it most together.,They are much more like younthan you would believe,,so try not to compare your insidesnto other people's outsides.,It will only make you worsenthan you already are. 
 (Laughter) 
 Also, you can't save, fixnor rescue any of them,or get anyone sober.,What helped me get cleannand sober 30 years ago,was the catastrophenof my behavior and thinking.,So I asked some sober friends for help,,and I turned to a higher power.,One acronym for Godnis the "gift of desperation,",G-O-D,,or as a sober friend put it,,by the end I was deteriorating fasternthan I could lower my standards. 
 (Laughter) 
 So God might mean, in this case,,"me running out of any more good ideas." 
 While fixing and savingnand trying to rescue is futile,,radical self-care is quantum,,and it radiates out from youninto the atmosphere,like a little fresh air.,It's a huge gift to the world.,When people respond by saying,n"Well, isn't she full of herself,",just smile obliquely like Mona Lisa,and make both of you a nice cup of tea.,Being full of affectionnfor one's goofy, self-centered,,cranky, annoying self,is home.,It's where world peace begins. 
 Number five:,chocolate with 75 percent cacaonis not actually a food. 
 (Laughter) 
 Its best use is as a bait in snake traps,or to balance the legs of wobbly chairs.,It was never meantnto be considered an edible. 
 Number six -- 
 (Laughter) 
 writing.,Every writer you know writesnreally terrible first drafts,,but they keep their butt in the chair.,That's the secret of life.,That's probably the main differencenbetween you and them.,They just do it.,They do it by prearrangementnwith themselves.,They do it as a debt of honor.,They tell stories that come through them,one day at a time, little by little.,When my older brother was in fourth grade,,he had a term paper on birdsndue the next day,,and he hadn't started.,So my dad sat down with himnwith an Audubon book,,paper, pencils and brads --,for those of you who have gottenna little less young and remember brads --,and he said to my brother,,"Just take it bird by bird, buddy.,Just read about pelicans,and then write about pelicansnin your own voice.,And then find out about chickadees,,and tell us about them in your own voice.,And then geese." 
 So the two most important thingsnabout writing are: bird by bird,and really god-awful first drafts.,If you don't know where to start,,remember that every single thingnthat happened to you is yours,,and you get to tell it.,If people wanted you to writenmore warmly about them,,they should've behaved better. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 You're going to feel like hellnif you wake up someday,and you never wrote the stuff,that is tugging on the sleevesnof your heart:,your stories, memories,nvisions and songs --,your truth,,your version of things --,in your own voice.,That's really all you have to offer us,,and that's also why you were born. 
 Seven: publication and temporaryncreative successes,are something you have to recover from.,They kill as many people as not.,They will hurt, damage and change you,in ways you cannot imagine.,The most degradednand evil people I've ever known,are male writers who've hadnhuge best sellers.,And yet, returning to number one,nthat all truth is paradox,,it's also a miraclento get your work published,,to get your stories read and heard.,Just try to bust yourselfngently of the fantasy,that publication will heal you,,that it will fill the Swiss-cheesynholes inside of you.,It can't.,It won't.,But writing can.,So can singing in a choirnor a bluegrass band.,So can painting communitynmurals or birding,or fostering old dogsnthat no one else will. 
 Number eight: families.,Families are hard, hard, hard,,no matter how cherishednand astonishing they may also be.,Again, see number one. 
 (Laughter) 
 At family gatherings where you suddenlynfeel homicidal or suicidal -- 
 (Laughter) 
 remember that in all cases,,it's a miracle that any of us,nspecifically, were conceived and born.,Earth is forgiveness school.,It begins with forgiving yourself,,and then you might as wellnstart at the dinner table.,That way, you can do this worknin comfortable pants. 
 (Laughter) 
 When William Blake said that we are here,to learn to endure the beams of love,,he knew that your family would benan intimate part of this,,even as you want to run screamingnfor your cute little life.,But I promise you are up to it.,You can do it, Cinderella, you can do it,,and you will be amazed. 
 Nine: food.,Try to do a little better.,I think you know what I mean. 
 (Laughter) 
 Number 10 -- 
 (Laughter) 
 grace.,Grace is spiritual WD-40,,or water wings.,The mystery of grace is that God lovesnHenry Kissinger and Vladimir Putin,and me,exactly as much as He or Shenloves your new grandchild.,Go figure. 
 (Laughter) 
 The movement of gracenis what changes us, heals us,and heals our world.,To summon grace, say, "Help,"nand then buckle up.,Grace finds you exactly where you are,,but it doesn't leave younwhere it found you.,And grace won't looknlike Casper the Friendly Ghost,,regrettably.,But the phone will ringnor the mail will come,and then against all odds,,you'll get your sense of humornabout yourself back.,Laughter really is carbonated holiness.,It helps us breathe again and again,and gives us back to ourselves,,and this gives us faithnin life and each other.,And remember -- grace always bats last. 
 Eleven: God just means goodness.,It's really not all that scary.,It means the divine or a loving,nanimating intelligence,,or, as we learnednfrom the great "Deteriorata,","the cosmic muffin.",A good name for God is: "Not me.",Emerson said thatnthe happiest person on Earth,is the one who learns from naturenthe lessons of worship.,So go outside a lot and look up.,My pastor said you can trap beesnon the bottom of mason jars without lids,because they don't look up,,so they just walk around bitterlynbumping into the glass walls.,Go outside. Look up.,Secret of life. 
 And finally: death.,Number 12.,Wow and yikes.,It's so hard to bear when the few peoplenyou cannot live without die.,You'll never get over these losses,nand no matter what the culture says,,you're not supposed to.,We Christians like to think of deathnas a major change of address,,but in any case, the personnwill live again fully in your heart,if you don't seal it off.,Like Leonard Cohen said,n"There are cracks in everything,,and that's how the light gets in.",And that's how we feelnour people again fully alive. 
 Also, the people will makenyou laugh out loud,at the most inconvenient times,,and that's the great good news.,But their absence will also be a lifelongnnightmare of homesickness for you.,Grief and friends, time and tearsnwill heal you to some extent.,Tears will bathe and baptizenand hydrate and moisturize you,and the ground on which you walk. 
 Do you know the first thingnthat God says to Moses?,He says, "Take off your shoes.",Because this is holy ground,nall evidence to the contrary.,It's hard to believe,nbut it's the truest thing I know.,When you're a little bit older,nlike my tiny personal self,,you realize that deathnis as sacred as birth.,And don't worry -- get on with your life.,Almost every single deathnis easy and gentle,with the very best people surrounding you,for as long as you need.,You won't be alone.,They'll help you cross overnto whatever awaits us.,As Ram Dass said,,"When all is said and done,,we're really just all walkingneach other home." 
 I think that's it,,but if I think of anything else,,I'll let you know. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 I was very surprised to be asked to come,,because it is not my realm,,technology or design or entertainment.,I mean, my realm is sort ofnfaith and writing,and kind of lurching along together.,And I was surprised,,but they said I could give a talk,nand I said I'd love to. 
 (Video) If you don't know where to start,,remember that every single thingnthat happened to you is yours,and you get to tell it. 
 Anne Lamott: People are very frightenednand feel really doomed,in America these days,,and I just wanted to help peoplenget their sense of humor about it,and to realize how much isn't a problem.,If you take an action,,take a really healthy or lovingnor friendly action,,you'll have loving and friendly feelings.I want you to touch your face.,Go on.,What do you feel?,Soft? Squishy?,It's you, right? You're feeling you?,Well, it's not quite true.,You're actually feelingnthousands of microscopic creatures,that live on our face and fingers.,You're feeling some of the fungi,that drifted downnfrom the air ducts today.,They set off our allergies,and smell of mildew.,You're feeling somenof the 100 billion bacterial cells,that live on our skin.,They've been munching awaynat your skin oils and replicating,,producing the smells of body odor.,You're likely even touchingnthe fecal bacteria,that sprayed onto you the last timenyou flushed a toilet,,or those bacteria that livenin our water pipes,and sprayed onto younwith your last shower.,Sorry. 
 (Laughter) 
 You're probably even givingna microscopic high five,to the two species of mitesnthat live on our faces,,on all of our faces.,They've spent the nightnsquirming across your face,and having sex on the bridge of your nose. 
 (Laughter) 
 Many of them are now leakingntheir gut contents onto your pores. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now look at your finger.,How's it feel? Gross?,In desperate need of soap or bleach?,That's how you feel now,,but it's not going to benhow you feel in the future. 
 For the last 100 years,,we've had an adversarial relationship,with the microscopic life nearest us.,If I told you there wasna bug in your house,or bacteria in your sink,,there was a human-devisednsolution for that,,a product to eradicate, exterminate,,disinfect.,We strive to remove mostnof the microscopic life in our world now.,But in doing so, we're ignoringnthe best source of new technology,on this planet.,The last 100 years have featurednhuman solutions to microbial problems,,but the next 100 years will featurenmicrobial solutions to human problems. 
 I'm a scientist, and I worknwith researchers,at North Carolina State Universitynand the University of Colorado,to uncover the microscopicnlife that is nearest us,,and that's often in our most intimatenand boring environments,,be it under our couches, in our backyards,,or in our belly buttons.,I do this work because it turns outnthat we know very little,about the microscopic lifenthat's nearest us.,As of a few years ago,nno scientist could tell you,what bugs or microorganismsnlive in your home --,your home, the place you knownbetter than anywhere else. 
 And so I and teams of others,are armed with Q-tips and tweezers,and advanced DNA techniques,to uncover the microscopicnlife nearest us.,In doing so, we foundnover 600 species of bugs,that live in USA homes,,everything from spiders and cockroaches,to tiny mites that cling to feathers.,And we found over 100,000 speciesnof bacteria and fungi,that live in our dust bunnies,,thousands more that livenon our clothes or in our showers.,We've gone further still,,and we looked at the microorganisms,that live inside the bodiesnof each of those bugs in our home.,In each bug, for example, a wasp,,we see a microscopic junglenunfold in a petri plate,,a world of hundreds of vibrant species.,Behold the biological cosmos!,So many of the speciesnyou're looking at right now,don't yet have names.,Most of the life around usnremains unknown. 
 I remember the first time I discoverednand got to name a new species.,It was a fungus that livesnin the nest of a paper wasp.,It's white and fluffy,,and I named it "mucor nidicola,",meaning in Latin that it livesnin the nest of another.,This is a picture of itngrowing on a dinosaur,,because everyonenthinks dinosaurs are cool.,At the time, I was in graduate school,,and I was so excitednthat I had found this new life form.,I called up my dad, and I go,,"Dad! I just discoveredna new microorganism species.",And he laughed and he goes,,"That's great. I hope you alsondiscovered a cure for it." 
 (Laughter) 
 "Cure it." 
 Now, my dad is my biggest fan,,so in that crushing moment where he wantednto kill my new little life form,,I realized that actually I had failed him,,both as a daughter and a scientist.,In my years toiling away in labsnand in people's backyards,,investigating and catalogingnthe microscopic life around us,,I'd never made clearnmy true mission to him.,My goal is not to find technology,to kill the new microscopicnlife around us.,My goal is to find new technologynfrom this life, that will help save us. 
 The diversity of life in our homes is morenthan a list of 100,000 new species.,It is 100,000 new sourcesnof solutions to human problems.,I know it's hard to believenthat anything that's so small,or only has one cell,can do anything powerful,,but they can.,These creaturesnare microscopic alchemists,,with the ability to transformntheir environment,with an arsenal of chemical tools.,This means that they can livenanywhere on this planet,,and they can eat whatevernfood is around them.,This means they can eat everythingnfrom toxic waste to plastic,,and they can produce waste productsnlike oil and battery power,and even tiny nuggets of real gold.,They can transform the inedibleninto nutritive.,They can make sugar into alcohol.,They give chocolate its flavor,,and soil the power to grow. 
 I'm here to tell you,that the next 100 years will featurenthese microscopic creatures,solving more of our problems.,And we have a lot of problemsnto choose from.,We've got the mundane:nbad-smelling clothes or bland food.,And we've got the monumental:,disease, pollution, war.,And so this is my mission:,to not just catalognthe microscopic life around us,,but to find out what it's uniquelynwell-suited to help us with. 
 Here's an example.,We started with a pest,,a wasp that lives on many of our homes.,Inside that wasp, we plucked outna little-known microorganism species,with a unique ability:,it could make beer.,This is a trait that onlyna few species on this planet have.,In fact, all commercially producednbeer you've ever had,likely came from one of onlynthree microorganism species.,Yet our species, it could makena beer that tasted like honey,,and it could also makena delightfully tart beer.,In fact, this microorganism speciesnthat lives in the belly of a wasp,,it could make a valuable sour beer,better than any other speciesnon this planet.,There are now four speciesnthat produce commercial beer.,Where you used to see a pest,,now think of tastingnyour future favorite beer. 
 As a second example,,I worked with researchersnto dig in the dirt in people's backyards.,There, we uncovered a microorganismnthat could make novel antibiotics,,antibiotics that can killnthe world's worst superbugs.,This was an awesome thing to find,,but here's the secret:,for the last 60 years,,most of the antibiotics on the market,have come from similar soil bacteria.,Every day, you and Inand everyone in this room,and on this planet,,are saved by similar soil bacterianthat produce most of our antibiotics.,Where you used to see dirt,,now think of medication. 
 Perhaps my favorite examplencomes from colleagues,who are studyingna pond scum microorganism,,which is tragically named afternthe cow dung it was first found in.,It's pretty unremarkablenand would be unworthy of discussion,,except that the researchers foundnthat if you feed it to mice,,it vaccinates against PTSD.,It vaccinates against fear.,Where you used to see pond scum,nnow think of hope. 
 There are so many more microbial examples,that I don't have timento talk about today.,I gave you examples of solutionsnthat came from just three species,,but imagine what those othern100,000 species in your dust bunnies,might be able to do.,In the future, they might be ablento make you sexier,or smarter,or perhaps live longer. 
 So I want you to looknat your finger again.,Think about all thosenmicroscopic creatures,that are unknown.,Think about in the futurenwhat they might be able to do,or make,or whose life they might be able to save.,How does your finger feel right now?,A little bit powerful?,That's because you're feeling the future. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Silicon Valleynis obsessed with disruption,,but these days, the biggest disruptorndidn't come out of Silicon Valley.,It came out of steel towns in Ohio,,rural communities in Pennsylvania,,the Panhandle in Florida.,And this last US presidential election,was the mother of all disruptions.,Once again, politics is personal.,Millions of Americansnbecame activists overnight,,pouring into the streets in record numbers,in record time. 
 (Laughter) 
 The election has donento family holiday dinners,what Uber has donento New York City's taxi system.,Couples have broken upnand marriages disrupted.,And the electionnis doing to my private life,what Amazon is doing to shopping malls.,These days, the ACLUnis on the front lines 24/7,,and even if I manage to sneak awaynfor a couple of miles on the treadmill,,any cardio benefit I getnis instantly obliterated,when I read another presidential tweetnon the headline scroll.,Even my secret pleasure,of studying the Italian painters,have been infected by politics. 
 Now, I study, even stalk, the old masters.,This is my desk,,with a postcard exhibition,of some famous and obscure paintings,mostly from the Italian Renaissance.,Now, art used to provide menwith a necessary break,from the hurly-burly of politics,in my daily work at the ACLU,,but not anymore. 
 I was at the Women's Marchnin San Francisco,the day after inauguration,,and the crowd was chanting,n"This is what democracy looks like.","This is what democracy looks like.",And there I was holding my signnand my umbrella in the rain,,and I flashed on an old painting,that first captivated me many years ago.,I struggled to remembernthe different pieces,of an actual painting,of good and bad government.,It was almost like the old masternwas taunting me.,You want to knownwhat democracy looks like?,Go back and look at my frescoes. 
 And so I did.,In 1339, Ambrogio Lorenzettinfinished a monumental commission,in the governing council chambernof Siena's Palazzo Pubblico.,It's a painting that speaks to us,neven screams to us, today.,"Art is a lie that makes usnrealize truth,",Pablo Picasso once said.,And as we search for the truthnabout government,,we should keep Ambrogio's work,,not a lie but an allegory,nin our collective mind's eye. 
 During Lorenzetti's time,,the political legitimacynof Italian city-states,was often on very shaky ground.,Siena was a republic,,but there had been enormous unrest,in the two decadesnleading up to the commission.,Siena's political leaders,nwho would literally govern,under the eyesnof these allegorical figures,,were Lorenzetti's intended audience.,He was cataloging the obligations,of the governing to the governed. 
 Now, you can spend yearsnstudying these frescoes.,Some scholars have.,I'm hardly an art historian,,but I am passionate about art,,and a work this massive can overwhelm me.,So first, I focus on the big stuff. 
 This is the allegory of good government.,The majestic figure here in the middle,is dressed in Siena's colors,and he personifies the republic itself.,Lorenzetti labels him "Commune,",and he's basically telling the Sienese,that they, and not a king or a tyrant,nmust rule themselves.,Now, surrounding Commune are his advisors.,Justice is enthroned.,She's looking up at the figure of wisdom,,who actually supportsnher scales of justice.,Concord, or Harmony,,holds a string that comesnoff the scales of justice,that binds her to the citizens,,making them allncompatriots in the republic.,And finally we see Peace.,She looks chilled out,,like she's listening to Bob Marley.,When good government rules,,Peace doesn't break a sweat. 
 Now, these are big images and big ideas,,but I really love the small stuff.,Along another wall,,Lorenzetti illustratesnthe effects of good government,on the real and everyday livesnof ordinary people,with a series of delicious little details.,In the countryside,nthe hills are landscaped and farmed.,Crops are being sown,nhoed, reaped, milled, plowed,,all in one picture.,Crops and livestocknare being brought to market.,In the city, builders raise a tower.,People attend a law lecture,na TED Talk of the 14th century. 
 (Laughter) 
 Schoolchildren play.,Tradesmen thrive.,Dancers larger than life dance with joy.,And watching over the republicnis the winged figure Security,,whose banner reads,,"Everyone shall go forthnfreely without fear." 
 Now, what's amazingnabout these images from 800 years ago,is that they're familiar to us today.,We see what democracy looks like.,We experience the effectsnof good government in our lives,,just as Lorenzetti did in his life. 
 But it is the allegory of bad government,that has been haunting mensince November 9.,It's badly damaged,,but it reads like today's newspapers.,And ruling over bad governmentnis not the Commune,but the Tyrant.,He has horns, tusks, crossed eyes,,braided hair.,He obviously spendsna lot of time on that hair. 
 (Laughter) 
 Justice now lies helpless at his feet,,shackled.,Her scales have been severed.,Justice is the key antagonistnto the Tyrant,,and she's been taken out. 
 Now, surrounding the Tyrant,,Lorenzetti illustratesnthe vices that animate bad government.,Avarice is the old womannclutching the strongbox,and a fisherman's hook,to pull in her fortune.,Vainglory carries a mirror,,and Lorenzetti warns usnagainst narcissistic leaders,who are guidednby their own ego and vanity.,On the Tyrant's right is Cruelty.,Treason, half lamb, half scorpion,,lulls us into a false sense of security,and then poisons a republic.,Fraud, with the flighty wings of a bat.,On the Tyrant's left, you see Division.,She's dressed in Siena's colors.,"Si" and "No" are painted on her body.,She uses a carpenter's sawnto chop her body in half.,And Fury wields the weapons of the mob,,the stone and knife. 
 In the remainder of the fresco,nLorenzetti shows us,the inevitable effects of bad government.,The civic ideals celebratednelsewhere in this room have failed us,,and we see it.,The once beautiful citynhas fallen to pieces,,the countryside barren,,the farms abandoned.,Many are in flames.,And in the sky abovenis not the winged figure Security,,but that of Fear, whose banner reads:,"None shall pass along this road,without fear of death." 
 Now, the final image,nthe most important one, really,,is one that Lorenzetti did not paint.,It is of the viewer.,Today, the audiencenfor Lorenzetti's frescoes,is not the governing but the governed,,the individual who standsnin front of his allegories,and walks away with insight,,who heeds a call to action.,Lorenzetti warns usnthat we must recognize the shadows,of Avarice, Fraud, Division, even Tyranny,when they floatnacross our political landscape,,especially when those shadows are cast,by political leaders loudly claimingnto be the voice of good government,and promising to make America great again. 
 And we must act.,Democracy must not be a spectator sport.,The right to protest,nthe right to assemble freely,,the right to petition one's government,,these are not just rights.,In the face of Avarice,nFraud and Division,,these are obligations.,We have to disrupt -- 
 (Applause) 
 We have to disrupt our lives,so that we can disrupt,the amoral accretion of power,by those who would betray our values.,We and we the people,must raise justice up,and must bring peace to our nation,and must come together in concord,,and we have a choice.,We could either paint ourselves,into the worst nightmarenof Lorenzetti's bad government,,or we can stay in the streets,,disruptive, messy, loud.,That is what democracy looks like. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: First of all, wow.,Obviously, many people passionately --,you spoke to many peoplenpassionately here.,I'm sure there are other people here,who'd say, look, Trump was electednby 63 million people.,He's far from perfect,,but he's trying to donwhat he was elected to do.,Shouldn't you give him a chance? 
 Anthony Romero:nI think we have to recognize,the legitimacy of him as president,versus the legitimacy of his policies.,And when so many of the policiesnare contrary to fundamental values,,that we're all equal under the law,,that we're not judged by the colornof our skin or the religion we worship,,we have to contest those values,even as we recognize and honor the fact,that our democracy rendered us a presidentnwho is championing those values. 
 CA: And the ACLU isn't justnthis force on the left, right?,You're making other arguments as well. 
 AR: Well, you know,,very often we pissneveryone off at one point.,That's what we do.,And we recently were taking stands,for why Ann Coulter needsnto be able to speak at Berkeley,,and why Milo has free speech rights.,And we even wrote a blog,that almost burnt the house downnamong some of our members,,unfortunately,nwhen we talked about the fact,that even Donald Trumpnhas free speech rights as president,,and an effort to hold him accountable,for incitement of violencenat his marches or his rallies,is unconstitutional and un-American.,And when you put that statement out there,to a very frothy base,that always is very excited for younto fight Donald Trump,,and then you have a new one saying,n"Wait, these rights are for everybody,,even the president that we don't like.",And that's our job. 
 (Applause) 
 CA: Anthony, you spokento so many of us so powerfully. 
 Thank you so much. Thank you. 
 (Applause)This is a picture of a sunset on Mars,taken by NASA's Curiosity rover in 2013.,Mars is a very cold planet,,flooded with high levels of UV radiation,and extremely dry.,In fact, Mars is considerednto be too dry for life as we know it. 
 I'm an astrobiologist.,I try to understandnthe origin of life on Earth,and the possibilities of finding life,elsewhere in the universe.,People sometimes ask me,,how can you be an astrobiologist,if you don't have your own spaceship? 
 Well, what I do is that I study life,in those environments on Earth,that most closely resemblenother interesting places in the universe.,All life on Earth requires water,,so in my case I focusnon the intimate relationship,between water and life,in order to understand,if we could find lifenin a planet as dry as Mars.,But since I do not haventhe 2.5 billion dollars,to send my own robot to Mars,,I study the most Martian place on Earth,,the Atacama Desert. 
 Located in northern Chile,,it is the oldestnand driest desert on Earth.,To give you an idea of how dry it is,,consider here in Vancouver it rainsnover 1,000 millimeters of rain every year.,In the Atacama, there are placesnwith no reported rains,in the last 400 years. 
 How do I know this?,Well, because I was bornnand raised in the Atacama -- 
 (Laughter) 
 So I had a unique advantage,when I started studying this desert.,So let me tell you guysna few fantastic examples,he has found,on how life has adaptednto live with almost no water at all. 
 One of my first findingsnwas in the entrance of a cave,facing the Pacific Ocean.,In this place, we reportedna new type of microalgae,that grew only on top of the spiderwebsnthat covered the cave entrance.,Have you ever seen a spiderwebnearly in the morning?,It's covered with dew,,so this microalgae learnednthat in order to carry photosynthesis,in the coast of the driestndesert on Earth,,they could use the spiderwebs.,So here they may accessnthe water from the fogs,that regularly covernthese areas in the morning. 
 In another cave, we foundna different type of microalgae.,This one is able to use ocean mistnas a source of water,,and strikingly livesnin the very bottom of a cave,,so it has adapted to livenwith less than 0.1 percent,of the amount of lightnthat regular plants need.,These type of findingsnsuggest to me that on Mars,,we may find evennphotosynthetic life inside caves.,And by the way, that's me. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, for almost 15 yearsnthis region of Yungay, discovered by NASA,,was thought to benthe driest place of this desert,,but I knew that it was not.,How? You already know the answer.,Because I was bornnand raised in this desert.,So I remembered that Inusually see fogs in Yungay,,so after setting sensorsnin a number of places,,where I remembernnever seeing fogs or clouds,,I reported four other sitesnmuch drier than Yungay,,with this one, María Elena South,,being the truly driest place on Earth,,as dry as Mars,,and amazingly, just a 15-minute ride,from the small mining townnwhere I was born. 
 Now, in this search, we were tryingnto actually find the dry limit,for life on Earth,,a place so dry that nothingnwas able to survive in it.,But even here, well hidden underground,,we found a numbernof different microorganisms,,which suggested to menthat similarly dry places, like Mars,,may be in inhabited.,We even have some preliminary evidences,that these microorganismsnmay still be active,in the desiccated state,,like walking mummies all around us,,and that they may be usingnUV radiation as a source of energy.,If confirmed, this would havena huge impact on our definition of life,,on how we look for lifenelsewhere in the universe. 
 Due to its clear skies, by 2020,,60 percent of the biggestntelescopes on Earth,will be located in the Atacama,,and while everyone elsenwill be looking among the stars,to answer the question, "Are we alone?",I will be looking down to the ground,searching for this same answer,in my own backyard. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)What's one thing that every personnin this room is going to become?,Older.,And most of us are scared stiffnat the prospect.,How does that word make you feel?,I used to feel the same way.,What was I most worried about?,Ending up droolingnin some grim institutional hallway.,And then I learned that onlynfour percent of older Americans,are living in nursing homes,,and the percentage is dropping.,What else was I worried about?,Dementia.,Turns out that most of usncan think just fine to the end.,Dementia rates are dropping, too.,The real epidemic is anxietynover memory loss. 
 (Laughter) 
 I also figured that old peoplenwere depressed,because they were oldnand they were going to die soon. 
 (Laughter) 
 It turns out that the longer people live,,the less they fear dying,,and that people are happiest atnthe beginnings and the end of their lives.,It's called the U-curve of happiness,,and it's been borne outnby dozens of studies around the world.,You don't have to be a Buddhistnor a billionaire.,The curve is a function of the waynaging itself affects the brain. 
 So I started feeling a lot betternabout getting older,,and I started obsessing about whynso few people know these things.,The reason is ageism:,discrimination and stereotypingnon the basis of age.,We experience it anytime someone assumesnwe're too old for something,,instead of finding out who we arenand what we're capable of,,or too young.,Ageism cuts both ways.,All -isms are socially constructednideas -- racism, sexism, homophobia --,and that means we make them up,,and they can change over time.,All these prejudicesnpit us against each other,to maintain the status quo,,like auto workers in the US competingnagainst auto workers in Mexico,instead of organizing for better wages. 
 (Applause) 
 We know it's not OK to allocatenresources by race or by sex.,Why should it be OK to weighnthe needs of the young against the old?,All prejudice relies on "othering" --nseeing a group of people,as other than ourselves:,other race, other religion,nother nationality.,The strange thing about ageism:,that other is us.,Ageism feeds on denial --nour reluctance to acknowledge,that we are going to becomenthat older person.,It's denial when we trynto pass for younger,or when we believe in anti-aging products,,or when we feel like our bodiesnare betraying us,,simply because they are changing.,Why on earth do we stop celebratingnthe ability to adapt and grow,as we move through life?,Why should aging well meannstruggling to look and move,like younger versions of ourselves?,It's embarrassingnto be called out as older,until we quit being embarrassed about it,,and it's not healthy to go through lifendreading our futures.,The sooner we get offnthis hamster wheel of age denial,,the better off we are. 
 Stereotypes are alwaysna mistake, of course,,but especially when it comes to age,,because the longer we live,,the more differentnfrom one another we become.,Right? Think about it.,And yet, we tend to think of everyonenin a retirement home,as the same age: old -- 
 (Laughter) 
 when they can span four decades.,Can you imagine thinking that waynabout a group of people,between the ages of 20 and 60? 
 When you get to a party, do you headnfor people your own age?,Have you ever grumblednabout entitled millennials?,Have you ever rejected a haircutnor a relationship or an outing,because it's not age-appropriate?,For adults, there's no such thing.,All these behaviors are ageist.,We all do them,,and we can't challenge biasnunless we're aware of it.,Nobody's born ageist,,but it starts at early childhood,,around the same time attitudesntowards race and gender start to form,,because negative messagesnabout late life bombard us,from the media and popularnculture at every turn.,Right? Wrinkles are ugly.,Old people are pathetic.,It's sad to be old. 
 Look at Hollywood.,A survey of recentnBest Picture nominations,found that only 12 percentnof speaking or named characters,were age 60 and up,,and many of themnwere portrayed as impaired.,Older people can benthe most ageist of all,,because we've had a lifetimento internalize these messages,and we've never thought to challenge them.,I had to acknowledge it,and stop colluding.,"Senior moment" quips, for example:,I stopped making them when it dawned on me,that when I lostnthe car keys in high school,,I didn't call it a "junior moment." 
 (Laughter) 
 I stopped blamingnmy sore knee on being 64.,My other knee doesn't hurt,,and it's just as old. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 We are all worried aboutnsome aspect of getting older,,whether running out of money,,getting sick, ending up alone,,and those fears are legitimate and real.,But what never dawns on most of us,is that the experience of reaching old age,can be better or worsendepending on the culture,in which it takes place.,It is not having a vaginanthat makes life harder for women.,It's sexism. 
 (Applause) 
 It's not loving a man that makesnlife harder for gay guys.,It's homophobia.,And it is not the passage of timenthat makes getting older,so much harder than it has to be.,It is ageism.,When labels are hard to read,or there's no handrail,or we can't open the damn jar,,we blame ourselves,,our failure to age successfully,,instead of the ageism that makesnthose natural transitions shameful,and the discrimination that makesnthose barriers acceptable.,You can't make money off satisfaction,,but shame and fear create markets,,and capitalism always needs new markets.,Who says wrinkles are ugly?,The multi-billion-dollarnskin care industry.,Who says perimenopause and low Tnand mild cognitive impairment,are medical conditions?,The trillion-dollarnpharmaceutical industry. 
 (Cheers) 
 The more clearly we seenthese forces at work,,the easier it is to come upnwith alternative, more positive,and more accurate narratives.,Aging is not a problem to be fixednor a disease to be cured.,It is a natural, powerful,nlifelong process that unites us all. 
 Changing the culture is a tall order,nI know that, but culture is fluid.,Look at how much the positionnof women has changed in my lifetime,or the incredible stridesnthat the gay rights movement,has made in just a few decades, right? 
 (Applause) 
 Look at gender.,We used to think of itnas a binary, male or female,,and now we understand it's a spectrum.,It is high time to ditchnthe old-young binary, too.,There is no line in the sandnbetween old and young,,after which it's all downhill.,And the longer we waitnto challenge that idea,,the more damage it doesnto ourselves and our place in the world,,like in the workforce,nwhere age discrimination is rampant.,In Silicon Valley, engineersnare getting Botoxed and hair-plugged,before key interviews --,and these are skillednwhite men in their 30s,,so imagine the effectsnfurther down the food chain. 
 (Laughter) 
 The personal and economicnconsequences are devastating.,Not one stereotype about older workersnholds up under scrutiny.,Companies aren't adaptable and creativenbecause their employees are young;,they're adaptable and creative despite it.,Companies -- 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 We know that diverse companiesnaren't just better places to work;,they work better.,And just like race and sex,nage is a criterion for diversity. 
 A growing body of fascinating research,shows that attitudes towards aging,affect how our minds and bodiesnfunction at the cellular level.,When we talk to older peoplenlike this (Speaks more loudly),or call them "sweetie" or "young lady" --,it's called elderspeak --,they appear to instantly age,,walking and talking less competently.,People with more positivenfeelings towards aging,walk faster,,they do better on memory tests,,they heal quicker, and they live longer.,Even with brainsnfull of plaques and tangles,,some people stayed sharp to the end.,What did they have in common?,A sense of purpose.,And what's the biggest obstaclento having a sense of purpose in late life?,A culture that tells us that getting oldernmeans shuffling offstage.,That's why the World HealthnOrganization is developing,a global anti-ageism initiative,to extend not justnlife span but health span. 
 Women experience the double whammy,of ageism and sexism,,so we experience aging differently.,There's a double standardnat work here -- shocker -- 
 (Laughter) 
 the notion that aging enhances mennand devalues women.,Women reinforce this double standardnwhen we compete to stay young,,another punishing and losing proposition.,Does any woman in this room really believe,that she is a lesser version --,less interesting, less fun in bed,nless valuable --,than the woman she once was?,This discrimination affects our health,,our well-being and our income,,and the effects add up over time.,They are further compoundednby race and by class,,which is why, everywhere in the world,,the poorest of the poornare old women of color. 
 What's the takeaway from that map?,By 2050, one out of five of us,,almost two billion people,,will be age 60 and up.,Longevity is a fundamental hallmarknof human progress.,All these older people represent a vastnunprecedented and untapped market.,And yet, capitalism and urbanizationnhave propelled age bias,into every corner of the globe,,from Switzerland,nwhere elders fare the best,,to Afghanistan, which sits at the bottomnof the Global AgeWatch Index.,Half of the world's countriesnaren't mentioned on that list,because we don't bother to collect datanon millions of people,because they're no longer young.,Almost two-thirds of peoplenover 60 around the world,say they have troublenaccessing healthcare.,Almost three-quarters say their incomendoesn't cover basic services,like food, water, electricity,nand decent housing.,Is this the world we want our children,nwho may well live to be a hundred,,to inherit?,Everyone -- all ages,nall genders, all nationalities --,is old or future-old,,and unless we put an end to it,nageism will oppress us all.,And that makes it a perfect targetnfor collective advocacy. 
 Why add another -ism to the listnwhen so many, racism in particular,,call out for action?,Here's the thing:,we don't have to choose.,When we make the worldna better place to grow old in,,we make it a better placenin which to be from somewhere else,,to have a disability,,to be queer, to be non-rich,nto be non-white.,And when we show up at all agesnfor whatever cause matters most to us --,save the whales, save the democracy --,we not only makenthat effort more effective,,we dismantle ageism in the process. 
 Longevity is here to stay.,A movement to end ageism is underway.,I'm in it, and I hope you will join me. 
 (Applause and cheers) 
 Thank you. Let's do it! Let's do it! 
 (Applause)Algorithms are everywhere.,They sort and separatenthe winners from the losers.,The winners get the job,or a good credit card offer.,The losers don't even get an interview,or they pay more for insurance.,We're being scored with secret formulasnthat we don't understand,that often don't have systems of appeal.,That begs the question:,What if the algorithms are wrong? 
 To build an algorithm you need two things:,you need data, what happened in the past,,and a definition of success,,the thing you're looking fornand often hoping for.,You train an algorithmnby looking, figuring out.,The algorithm figures outnwhat is associated with success.,What situation leads to success? 
 Actually, everyone uses algorithms.,They just don't formalize themnin written code.,Let me give you an example.,I use an algorithm every daynto make a meal for my family.,The data I use,is the ingredients in my kitchen,,the time I have,,the ambition I have,,and I curate that data.,I don't count those little packagesnof ramen noodles as food. 
 (Laughter) 
 My definition of success is:,a meal is successfulnif my kids eat vegetables.,It's very differentnfrom if my youngest son were in charge.,He'd say success is ifnhe gets to eat lots of Nutella.,But I get to choose success.,I am in charge. My opinion matters.,That's the first rule of algorithms. 
 Algorithms are opinions embedded in code.,It's really different from what you thinknmost people think of algorithms.,They think algorithms are objectivenand true and scientific.,That's a marketing trick.,It's also a marketing trick,to intimidate you with algorithms,,to make you trust and fear algorithms,because you trust and fear mathematics.,A lot can go wrong when we putnblind faith in big data. 
 This is Kiri Soares.nShe's a high school principal in Brooklyn.,In 2011, she told menher teachers were being scored,with a complex, secret algorithm,called the "value-added model.",I told her, "Well, figure outnwhat the formula is, show it to me.,I'm going to explain it to you.",She said, "Well, I triednto get the formula,,but my Department of Education contactntold me it was math,and I wouldn't understand it." 
 It gets worse.,The New York Post filedna Freedom of Information Act request,,got all the teachers' namesnand all their scores,and they published themnas an act of teacher-shaming.,When I tried to get the formulas,nthe source code, through the same means,,I was told I couldn't.,I was denied.,I later found out,that nobody in New York Citynhad access to that formula.,No one understood it.,Then someone really smartngot involved, Gary Rubinstein.,He found 665 teachersnfrom that New York Post data,that actually had two scores.,That could happen if they were teaching,seventh grade math and eighth grade math.,He decided to plot them.,Each dot represents a teacher. 
 (Laughter) 
 What is that? 
 (Laughter) 
 That should never have been usednfor individual assessment.,It's almost a random number generator. 
 (Applause) 
 But it was.,This is Sarah Wysocki.,She got fired, alongnwith 205 other teachers,,from the Washington, DC school district,,even though she had greatnrecommendations from her principal,and the parents of her kids. 
 I know what a lotnof you guys are thinking,,especially the data scientists,nthe AI experts here.,You're thinking, "Well, I would never makenan algorithm that inconsistent.",But algorithms can go wrong,,even have deeply destructive effectsnwith good intentions.,And whereas an airplanenthat's designed badly,crashes to the earth and everyone sees it,,an algorithm designed badly,can go on for a long time,nsilently wreaking havoc. 
 This is Roger Ailes. 
 (Laughter) 
 He founded Fox News in 1996.,More than 20 women complainednabout sexual harassment.,They said they weren't allowednto succeed at Fox News.,He was ousted last year,nbut we've seen recently,that the problems have persisted.,That begs the question:,What should Fox News donto turn over another leaf? 
 Well, what if they replacedntheir hiring process,with a machine-learning algorithm?,That sounds good, right?,Think about it.,The data, what would the data be?,A reasonable choice would be the lastn21 years of applications to Fox News.,Reasonable.,What about the definition of success?,Reasonable choice would be,,well, who is successful at Fox News?,I guess someone who, say,nstayed there for four years,and was promoted at least once.,Sounds reasonable.,And then the algorithm would be trained.,It would be trained to look for peoplento learn what led to success,,what kind of applicationsnhistorically led to success,by that definition.,Now think about what would happen,if we applied thatnto a current pool of applicants.,It would filter out women,because they do not look like peoplenwho were successful in the past. 
 Algorithms don't make things fair,if you just blithely,nblindly apply algorithms.,They don't make things fair.,They repeat our past practices,,our patterns.,They automate the status quo.,That would be greatnif we had a perfect world,,but we don't.,And I'll add that most companiesndon't have embarrassing lawsuits,,but the data scientists in those companies,are told to follow the data,,to focus on accuracy.,Think about what that means.,Because we all have bias,nit means they could be codifying sexism,or any other kind of bigotry. 
 Thought experiment,,because I like them:,an entirely segregated society --,racially segregated, all towns,nall neighborhoods,and where we send the policenonly to the minority neighborhoods,to look for crime.,The arrest data would be very biased.,What if, on top of that,nwe found the data scientists,and paid the data scientists to predictnwhere the next crime would occur?,Minority neighborhood.,Or to predict who the nextncriminal would be?,A minority.,The data scientists would bragnabout how great and how accurate,their model would be,,and they'd be right. 
 Now, reality isn't that drastic,nbut we do have severe segregations,in many cities and towns,,and we have plenty of evidence,of biased policingnand justice system data.,And we actually do predict hotspots,,places where crimes will occur.,And we do predict, in fact,nthe individual criminality,,the criminality of individuals.,The news organization ProPublicanrecently looked into,one of those "recidivism risk" algorithms,,as they're called,,being used in Floridanduring sentencing by judges.,Bernard, on the left, the black man,nwas scored a 10 out of 10.,Dylan, on the right, 3 out of 10.,10 out of 10, high risk.n3 out of 10, low risk.,They were both brought innfor drug possession.,They both had records,,but Dylan had a felony,but Bernard didn't.,This matters, becausenthe higher score you are,,the more likely you're being givenna longer sentence. 
 What's going on?,Data laundering.,It's a process by whichntechnologists hide ugly truths,inside black box algorithms,and call them objective;,call them meritocratic.,When they're secret,nimportant and destructive,,I've coined a term for these algorithms:,"weapons of math destruction." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 They're everywhere,nand it's not a mistake.,These are private companiesnbuilding private algorithms,for private ends.,Even the ones I talked aboutnfor teachers and the public police,,those were built by private companies,and sold to the government institutions.,They call it their "secret sauce" --,that's why they can't tell us about it.,It's also private power.,They are profiting for wieldingnthe authority of the inscrutable.,Now you might think,nsince all this stuff is private,and there's competition,,maybe the free marketnwill solve this problem.,It won't.,There's a lot of moneynto be made in unfairness. 
 Also, we're not economic rational agents.,We all are biased.,We're all racist and bigotednin ways that we wish we weren't,,in ways that we don't even know.,We know this, though, in aggregate,,because sociologistsnhave consistently demonstrated this,with these experiments they build,,where they send a bunchnof applications to jobs out,,equally qualified but somenhave white-sounding names,and some have black-sounding names,,and it's always disappointing,nthe results -- always. 
 So we are the ones that are biased,,and we are injecting those biasesninto the algorithms,by choosing what data to collect,,like I chose not to thinknabout ramen noodles --,I decided it was irrelevant.,But by trusting the data that's actuallynpicking up on past practices,and by choosing the definition of success,,how can we expect the algorithmsnto emerge unscathed?,We can't. We have to check them.,We have to check them for fairness. 
 The good news is,nwe can check them for fairness.,Algorithms can be interrogated,,and they will tell usnthe truth every time.,And we can fix them.nWe can make them better.,I call this an algorithmic audit,,and I'll walk you through it. 
 First, data integrity check.,For the recidivism risknalgorithm I talked about,,a data integrity check would meannwe'd have to come to terms with the fact,that in the US, whites and blacksnsmoke pot at the same rate,but blacks are far more likelynto be arrested --,four or five times more likely,ndepending on the area.,What is that bias looking likenin other crime categories,,and how do we account for it? 
 Second, we should think aboutnthe definition of success,,audit that.,Remember -- with the hiringnalgorithm? We talked about it.,Someone who stays for four yearsnand is promoted once?,Well, that is a successful employee,,but it's also an employeenthat is supported by their culture.,That said, also it can be quite biased.,We need to separate those two things.,We should look tonthe blind orchestra audition,as an example.,That's where the people auditioningnare behind a sheet.,What I want to think about there,is the people who are listeningnhave decided what's important,and they've decided what's not important,,and they're not gettingndistracted by that.,When the blind orchestranauditions started,,the number of women in orchestrasnwent up by a factor of five. 
 Next, we have to consider accuracy.,This is where the value-added modelnfor teachers would fail immediately.,No algorithm is perfect, of course,,so we have to considernthe errors of every algorithm.,How often are there errors,nand for whom does this model fail?,What is the cost of that failure? 
 And finally, we have to consider,the long-term effects of algorithms,,the feedback loops that are engendering.,That sounds abstract,,but imagine if Facebook engineersnhad considered that,before they decided to show usnonly things that our friends had posted. 
 I have two more messages,none for the data scientists out there.,Data scientists: we shouldnnot be the arbiters of truth.,We should be translatorsnof ethical discussions that happen,in larger society. 
 (Applause) 
 And the rest of you,,the non-data scientists:,this is not a math test.,This is a political fight.,We need to demand accountabilitynfor our algorithmic overlords. 
 (Applause) 
 The era of blind faithnin big data must end. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Do you remembernthese glow-in-the-dark little stars,which you had on the ceilingnwhen you were a boy or a girl?,Yes?,It is light.,It is pure light.,I think I stared at them way too long,when I was a five-year-old, you know?,It's so beautiful:,no energy bill, no maintenance.,It is there. 
 So two years ago, we went back to the lab,,making it more durable,nmore light-emitting,,with the experts.,And at the same time,nwe got a request from this guy --,Van Gogh, the famousnVan Gogh Foundation --,who wanted to celebratenhis 125th anniversary in the Netherlands.,And they came to me and asked,,"Can you make a placenwhere he feels more alive again,in the Netherlands?",And I liked that question a lot,,so in way,,we sort of started to connectnthese two different worlds.,This is how my brain works,,by the way. 
 (Laughter) 
 I would love to keep onndoing this for an hour,,but OK -- 
 (Laughter) 
 And this is the result that we made:,a bicycle path which chargesnat daytime via the sun,and glows at night, up to eight hours. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 ... hinting towards a futurenwhich should be energy friendly,and linking up the local grounds,as Van Gogh literally walkednand lived there in 1883.,And you can go there every nightnfor free, no ticket needed.,People experience the beautynof cycling through the starry night,,thinking about green energy and safety. 
 I want to create placesnwhere people feel connected again.,And it was somehow greatnto make these projects happen,with the industry,nwith the infrastructure companies.,So when these sheikhs of Qatarnstarted to call:,"How much for 10 kilometers?" 
 (Laughter) 
 Yeah, really, that's a weird callnyou're going to get.,But it's fascinating,that this is not just a sortnof one-off, nice-to-have special.,I think this kind of creative thinking,nthese kinds of connections --,it's the new economy. 
 The World Economic Forum,nthe think tank in Geneva,,did an interviewnwith a lot of smart people,all around the world,,asking, "What are the top 10 skillsnyou and I need to become successful?",And what is interesting,nwhat you see here:,it's not about money,or being really good in C++,,although these are great skillsnto have, I have to admit.,But look at number three, creativity;,number two, critical thinking;,number one, complex problem-solving --,all the things a robot or a computernis really bad at.,And this makes me very optimistic,nvery hopeful for the new world,,that as we will livenin this hyper-technological world,,our human skills --,our desire for empathy,,our desire for curiosity,,our desire for beauty --,will be more appreciated again,,and we will live in a worldnwhere creativity is our true capital. 
 And a creative process like that --,I don't know how it works for you,,but in my brain, it always startsnwith a question:,Why?,Why does a jellyfish emit light?,Or a firefly?,Or why do be accept pollution?,This is from my roomnin Beijing three years ago.,Left image is a good day -- Saturday.,I can see the carsnand the people, the birds;,life is OK in a dense urban city.,And on the right image --,holy moly.,Pollution -- complete layers.,I couldn't even seenthe other side of the city.,And this image made me really sad.,This is not the bright futurenwe envision here at TED --,this is the horror.,We live five to six years shorter;,children have lung cancernwhen they're six years old.,And so in a weird, beautiful way,,I, at that moment, became inspirednby Beijing smog. 
 And the governments all around the worldnare fighting their war on smog,,but I wanted to make somethingnwithin the now.,So we decided to buildnthe largest smog vacuum cleaner,in the world.,It sucks up polluted air, cleans it,and then releases it.,And we built the first one.,So it sucks up 30,000ncubic meters per hour,,cleans it on the nano level --nthe PM2.5, PM10 particles --,using very little electricity,,and then releases the clean air,,so we have parks, playgrounds,nwhich are 55 to 75 percent more clean,than the rest of the city. 
 (Applause) 
 Yes! 
 (Applause) 
 And every month or so,,it opens like a spaceship --,like a Marilyn Monroe with the --nwell, you know what.,Anyway. 
 (Laughter) 
 So this ...,this is the stuff we are capturing.,This is Beijing smog.,This is in our lungs right now.,If you live next to a highway,nit's the same as 17 cigarettes per day.,Are we insane?,When did we say yes to that?,And we had bucketsnof this disgusting material,in our studio,,and on a Monday morning,nwe were discussing, we were like,,"Shit, what should we do with it?nShould we throw it away?",Like, "Help!",And then we realized:nno, no, no, no, no --,waste should not exist.,Waste for the one should benfood for the other.,So, here, maybe show it around.,Do not put this in your coffee. 
 (Laughter) 
 And we realized that 42 percentnis made out of carbon,,and carbon, of course,nunder high pressure,,you get ...,diamonds.,So, inspired by that,nwe compress it for 30 minutes -- 
 (Cracking sound) 
 and make smog-free rings. 
 (Laughter) 
 And so by sharing -- yeah, really!,And so by sharing a ring,,you donate 1,000 cubic meters of clean air,to the city the tower is in. 
 (Applause) 
 I have one here -- 
 (Applause) 
 A little floating cube.,I will give one to you.,I'm not going to propose, don't worry. 
 (Laughter) 
 Are we good?,You can show it around. 
 And we put this online --nKickstarter campaign, crowdfunding.,And people started to preorder it,,but more importantly,nthey started to prepay it.,So the finance we made with the jewelrynhelped us to realize,,to build the first tower.,And that's powerful.,So the waste the activator,nit was the enabler.,Also, the feedback from the community --,this is a wedding couple from India,,where he proposed to hernwith the smog-free ring,as a sign of true beauty,,as a sign of hope.,And she said yes. 
 (Laughter) 
 I love this image so muchnfor a lot of different reasons. 
 (Laughter) 
 And right now, the projectnis touring through China,,actually with the supportnof China's central government.,So the first goal is to createnlocal clean-air parks,,and that works already quite well --,55, 75 percent more clean.,And at the same time,,we team up with the NGOs,,with the governors,,with the students,,with the tech people,,to say, "Hey, what do we need to donto make a whole city smog-free?",It's about the dream of clean air.,We do workshops. New ideas pop up.,These are smog-free bicyclesnwhich -- I'm Dutch, yes? --,I have this "bicycle DNA"ninside of me somewhere.,And so it sucks up polluted air,,it cleans it and releases it,,in the fight against the car,,in the celebration of the bicycle. 
 And so right now, we're workingnon a sort of "package deal," so to speak,,where we say, "Smog-free towers,nsmog-free rings.",We go to the mayorsnor the governors of this world,,and say, "We can guaranteena short-term reduction of pollution,between 20 and 40 percent.,Please sign here right now.",Yes? 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 So it's all about connectingnnew technology with creative thinking.,And if you start thinking about that,,there is so much you can imagine,,so much more you can do.,We worked on dance floorsnwhich produce electricity,when you dance on them.,We did the design for that -- 2008.,So it moves eight or nine millimeters,,produces 25 watts.,The electricity that we generatenis used for the lighting or the DJ booth.,So some of the sustainabilitynis about doing more,,not about doing less. 
 But also on a larger scale,,the Netherlands, where I'mnfrom, we live below sea level.,So because of these beauties --,the Afsluitdijk: 32 kilometers,nbuilt by hand in 1932 --,we live with the water,,we fight with the water,,we try to find harmony,,but sometimes we forget.,And therefore, we made "Waterlicht,",a combination of LEDs and lenses,,which show how highnthe water level would be --,global change --,if we stop.,If, today, we all go home and we say,,"Oh, whatever, somebody elsenwill do it for us,",or we'll wait for government or whomever.,You know, we're not going to do that.,It goes wrong.,And we placed this in public spacesnall around the world.,Thousands of people showed up. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you.,You're too nice, you're too nice.nThat's not good for a designer. 
 So thousands of people showed up,,and some, actually, were scared.,And they left; they experiencednthe floods in 1953.,And others were mesmerized.,Can we make floating cities?,Can we generate electricitynfrom the change in tides?,So I think it's so importantnto make experiences --,collective experiences --,where people feel connectednwith a vision, with a future,and trigger what is possible. 
 At the same time,,you know, these kinds of things --nthey're not easy, yes?,It's a struggle.,And what I experienced in my life,is that a lot of people saynthey want innovation,,and they want the nextnand the new, the future.,But the moment you present a new idea,,there's this weird tendencynto reply to every new idea,starting with two words.,Which are? 
 (Audience guesses) 
 No, not "How much?" It's more annoying. 
 (Laughter) 
 What is it, guys?,Or you're really blessed people?nThat's really good. 
 "Yes, but." Very good.,"Yes, but: it's too expensive, it's tooncheap, it's too fast, it's too slow,,it's too beautiful, it's too ugly,nit cannot be done, it already exists.",I heard everything about the same project,in the same week.,And I got really, really annoyed.,I got a bit of gray hair, started to dressnin black like a true architect. 
 (Laughter) 
 And one morning I woke upnand I said, "Daan, stop.,This is dragging you down.,You have to do something with this.,You have to use itnas an ingredient, as a component.",And so we decided to build,,to realize the famous "Yes, but" chair. 
 (Laughter) 
 And this is an existing chairnby Friso Kramer, a Dutch design.,But we gave it a little "update,",a little "hack," so to speak.,We placed a little voice-recognitionnelement right here.,So the moment you sit on that chair,,and you say those two horrible,,creative-destructive,nannoying little words -- 
 (Laughter) 
 you get a short -- 
 (Laughter) 
 but pretty intense,little shock on the back sidenof your bottom. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 And -- 
 (Applause) 
 and that works; yeah, that works.,Some clients have left us,nthey got really mad.,Fortunately, the good ones have stayed.,And, of course, we alsonapply it to ourselves. 
 But ladies and gentlemen,nlet's not be afraid.,Let's be curious, yes?,And, you know, walkingnthrough TED in these days,and hearing the other speakers,and feeling the energy of the crowd,,I was remembering this quotenof the Canadian author, Marshall McLuhan,,who once famously said,,"On spacecraft earth,,there are no passengers.,We are all crew.",And I think this so beautiful.,This is so beautiful!,We're not just consumers; we're makers:,we make decisions,,we make new inventions,,we make new dreams.,And I think,if we start implementingnthat kind of thinking even more,within today,,there's still a whole new worldnto be explored. 
 All right, thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So, I'm afraid.,Right now,,on this stage,,I feel fear.,In my life, I ain't met many people,that will readily admitnwhen they are afraid.,And I think that's because deep down,,they know how easy it spreads.,See, fear is like a disease.,When it moves, it moves like wildfire.,But what happens when,,even in the face of that fear,,you do what you've got to do?,That's called courage.,And just like fear,,courage is contagious. 
 See, I'm from East St. Louis, Illinois.,That's a small city,across the Mississippi Rivernfrom St. Louis, Missouri.,I have lived in and aroundnSt. Louis my entire life.,When Michael Brown, Jr.,,an ordinary teenager,,was gunned down by police in 2014nin Ferguson, Missouri --,another suburb, but north of St. Louis --,I remember thinking,,he ain't the first,,and he won't be the last young kidnto lose his life to law enforcement. 
 But see, his death was different.,When Mike was killed,,I remember the powers that bentrying to use fear as a weapon.,The police response to a communitynin mourning was to use force,to impose fear:,fear of militarized police,,imprisonment,,fines.,The media even triednto make us afraid of each other,by the way they spun the story.,And all of these thingsnhave worked in the past.,But like I said,nthis time it was different. 
 Michael Brown's death and the subsequentntreatment of the community,led to a string of protests in and aroundnFerguson and St. Louis.,When I got out to those protestsnabout the fourth or fifth day,,it was not out of courage;,it was out of guilt.,See, I'm black.,I don't know if y'all noticed that. 
 (Laughter) 
 But I couldn't sit in St. Louis,nminutes away from Ferguson,,and not go see.,So I got off my ass to go check it out. 
 When I got out there,,I found something surprising.,I found anger; there was a lot of that.,But what I found more of was love.,People with love for themselves.,Love for their community.,And it was beautiful --,until the police showed up.,Then a new emotion was interjectedninto the conversation:,fear. 
 Now, I'm not going to lie;,when I saw those armored vehicles,,and all that gear,and all those guns,and all those police,I was terrified --,personally.,And when I looked around that crowd,,I saw a lot of people that hadnthe same thing going on.,But I also saw peoplenwith something else inside of them.,That was courage.,See, those people yelled,,and they screamed,,and they were not aboutnto back down from the police.,They were past that point.,And then I could feelnsomething in me changing,,so I yelled and I screamed,,and I noticed that everybody around menwas doing the same thing.,And there was nothing like that feeling. 
 So I decided I wantednto do something more.,I went home, I thought:nI'm an artist. I make shit.,So I started making thingsnspecific to the protest,,things that would be weaponsnin a spiritual war,,things that would give people voice,and things that would fortify themnfor the road ahead. 
 I did a project where I took picturesnof the hands of protesters,and put them up and downnthe boarded-up buildings,and community shops.,My goal was to raise awarenessnand to raise the morale.,And I think, for a minute at least,,it did just that.,Then I thought, I want to upliftnthe stories of these people,I was watching beingncourageous in the moment.,And myself and my friend,,and filmmaker and partner Sabaah Folayan,did just that with our documentary,,"Whose Streets?" 
 I kind of became a conduit,for all of this couragenthat was given to me.,And I think that's partnof our job as artists.,I think we should be conveyorsnof courage in the work that we do.,And I think that we are the wallnbetween the normal folks,and the people that use their powernto spread fear and hate,,especially in times like these. 
 So I'm going to ask you.,Y'all the movers and the shakers,,you know, the thought leaders:,What are you gonna do,with the gifts that you've been given,to break us from the fearnthe binds us every day? 
 Because, see, I'm afraid every day.,I can't remember a time when I wasn't.,But once I figured out that fearnwas not put in me to cripple me,,it was there to protect me,,and once I figured outnhow to use that fear,,I found my power. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm going to speak to younabout the global refugee crisis,and my aim is to show you that this crisis,is manageable, not unsolvable,,but also show you that this isnas much about us and who we are,as it is a trial of the refugeesnon the front line. 
 For me, this is notnjust a professional obligation,,because I run an NGO supporting refugeesnand displaced people around the world.,It's personal. 
 I love this picture.,That really handsome guy on the right,,that's not me.,That's my dad, Ralph, in London, in 1940,with his father Samuel.,They were Jewish refugees from Belgium.,They fled the day the Nazis invaded.,And I love this picture, too.,It's a group of refugee children,arriving in England in 1946 from Poland.,And in the middle is my mother, Marion.,She was sent to start a new life,in a new country,on her own,at the age of 12.,I know this:,if Britain had not admitted refugees,in the 1940s,,I certainly would not be here today. 
 Yet 70 years on,nthe wheel has come full circle.,The sound is of walls being built,,vengeful political rhetoric,,humanitarian values and principles on fire,in the very countriesnthat 70 years ago said never again,to statelessness and hopelessnessnfor the victims of war.,Last year, every minute,,24 more people were displacednfrom their homes,by conflict, violence and persecution:,another chemical weapon attack in Syria,,the Taliban on the rampage in Afghanistan,,girls driven from their schoolnin northeast Nigeria by Boko Haram.,These are not peoplenmoving to another country,to get a better life.,They're fleeing for their lives. 
 It's a real tragedy,that the world's most famous refugeencan't come to speak to you here today.,Many of you will know this picture.,It shows the lifeless body,of five-year-old Alan Kurdi,,a Syrian refugee who diednin the Mediterranean in 2015.,He died alongside 3,700 othersntrying to get to Europe.,The next year, 2016,,5,000 people died.,It's too late for them,,but it's not too latenfor millions of others. 
 It's not too latenfor people like Frederick.,I met him in the Nyarugusunrefugee camp in Tanzania.,He's from Burundi.,He wanted to knownwhere could he complete his studies.,He'd done 11 years of schooling.nHe wanted a 12th year.,He said to me, "I praynthat my days do not end here,in this refugee camp." 
 And it's not too late for Halud.,Her parents were Palestinian refugees,living in the Yarmouk refugee campnoutside Damascus.,She was born to refugee parents,,and now she's a refugeenherself in Lebanon.,She's working for the InternationalnRescue Committee to help other refugees,,but she has no certainty at all,about her future,,where it is or what it holds. 
 This talk is about Frederick, about Halud,and about millions like them:,why they're displaced,,how they survive, what help they neednand what our responsibilities are.,I truly believe this,,that the biggest questionnin the 21st century,concerns our duty to strangers.,The future "you" is about your duties,to strangers.,You know better than anyone,,the world is more connectednthan ever before,,yet the great danger,is that we're consumed by our divisions.,And there is no better test of that,than how we treat refugees. 
 Here are the facts: 65 million people,displaced from their homesnby violence and persecution last year.,If it was a country,,that would be the 21stnlargest country in the world.,Most of those people, about 40 million,nstay within their own home country,,but 25 million are refugees.,That means they cross a borderninto a neighboring state.,Most of them are living in poor countries,,relatively poor or lower-middle-incomencountries, like Lebanon,,where Halud is living.,In Lebanon, onenin four people is a refugee,,a quarter of the whole population. 
 And refugees stay for a long time.,The average length of displacement,is 10 years.,I went to what was the world'snlargest refugee camp, in eastern Kenya.,It's called Dadaab.,It was built in 1991-92,as a "temporary camp"nfor Somalis fleeing the civil war.,I met Silo.,And naïvely I said to Silo,,"Do you think you'll everngo home to Somalia?",And she said, "What do you mean, go home?,I was born here.",And then when I asked the camp management,how many of the 330,000 peoplenin that camp were born there,,they gave me the answer:,100,000.,That's what long-term displacement means. 
 Now, the causes of this are deep:,weak states that can'tnsupport their own people,,an international political system,weaker than at any time since 1945,and differences over theology, governance,nengagement with the outside world,in significant parts of the Muslim world.,Now, those are long-term,ngenerational challenges.,That's why I say that this refugee crisisnis a trend and not a blip.,And it's complex, and when you havenbig, large, long-term, complex problems,,people think nothing can be done. 
 When Pope Francis went to Lampedusa,,off the coast of Italy, in 2014,,he accused all of usnand the global population,of what he calledn"the globalization of indifference.",It's a haunting phrase.,It means that our heartsnhave turned to stone.,Now, I don't know, you tell me.,Are you allowed to argue with the Pope,neven at a TED conference?,But I think it's not right.,I think people do wantnto make a difference,,but they just don't know whethernthere are any solutions to this crisis.,And what I want to tell you today,is that though the problems are real,nthe solutions are real, too. 
 Solution one:,these refugees need to get into worknin the countries where they're living,,and the countries where they're livingnneed massive economic support.,In Uganda in 2014, they did a study:,80 percent of refugeesnin the capital city Kampala,needed no humanitarian aidnbecause they were working.,They were supported into work. 
 Solution number two:,education for kidsnis a lifeline, not a luxury,,when you're displaced for so long.,Kids can bounce back when they're givennthe proper social, emotional support,alongside literacy and numeracy.,I've seen it for myself.,But half of the world's refugee childrennof primary school age,get no education at all,,and three-quarters of secondary school agenget no education at all.,That's crazy. 
 Solution number three:,most refugees are in urban areas,nin cities, not in camps.,What would you or I wantnif we were a refugee in a city?,We would want moneynto pay rent or buy clothes.,That is the futurenof the humanitarian system,,or a significant part of it:,give people cash so thatnyou boost the power of refugees,and you'll help the local economy. 
 And there's a fourth solution, too,,that's controversialnbut needs to be talked about.,The most vulnerable refugeesnneed to be given a new start,and a new life in a new country,,including in the West.,The numbers are relatively small,nhundreds of thousands, not millions,,but the symbolism is huge.,Now is not the timento be banning refugees,,as the Trump administration proposes.,It's a time to be embracing peoplenwho are victims of terror.,And remember -- 
 (Applause) 
 Remember, anyone who asks you,n"Are they properly vetted?",that's a really sensiblenand good question to ask.,The truth is, refugeesnarriving for resettlement,are more vetted than any other populationnarriving in our countries.,So while it's reasonablento ask the question,,it's not reasonable to say that refugeenis another word for terrorist. 
 Now, what happens -- 
 (Applause) 
 What happens when refugees can't get work,,they can't get their kids into school,,they can't get cash,nthey can't get a legal route to hope?,What happens is they take risky journeys.,I went to Lesbos, this beautifulnGreek island, two years ago.,It's a home to 90,000 people.,In one year, 500,000 refugeesnwent across the island.,And I want to show you what I saw,when I drove acrossnto the north of the island:,a pile of life jacketsnof those who had made it to shore.,And when I looked closer,,there were smallnlife jackets for children,,yellow ones.,And I took this picture.,You probably can't see the writing,nbut I want to read it for you.,"Warning: will notnprotect against drowning.",So in the 21st century,,children are being given life jackets,to reach safety in Europe,even though those jacketsnwill not save their lives,if they fall out of the boatnthat is taking them there. 
 This is not just a crisis, it's a test.,It's a test that civilizationsnhave faced down the ages.,It's a test of our humanity.,It's a test of us in the Western world,of who we are and what we stand for.,It's a test of our character,nnot just our policies.,And refugees are a hard case.,They do come from farawaynparts of the world.,They have been through trauma.,They're often of a different religion.,Those are precisely the reasonsnwe should be helping refugees,,not a reason not to help them.,And it's a reason to help themnbecause of what it says about us.,It's revealing of our values.,Empathy and altruism are twonof the foundations of civilization.,Turn that empathy and altruism into action,and we live out a basic moral credo. 
 And in the modern world,nwe have no excuse.,We can't say we don't knownwhat's happening in Juba, South Sudan,,or Aleppo, Syria.,It's there, in our smartphone,in our hand.,Ignorance is no excuse at all.,Fail to help, and we shownwe have no moral compass at all. 
 It's also revealing aboutnwhether we know our own history.,The reason that refugeesnhave rights around the world,is because of extraordinarynWestern leadership,by statesmen and womennafter the Second World War,that became universal rights.,Trash the protections of refugees,nand we trash our own history.,This is -- 
 (Applause) 
 This is also revealingnabout the power of democracy,as a refuge from dictatorship.,How many politicians have you heard say,,"We believe in the power of our example,nnot the example of our power.",What they mean is what we stand fornis more important than the bombs we drop.,Refugees seeking sanctuary,have seen the West as a sourcenof hope and a place of haven.,Russians, Iranians,,Chinese, Eritreans, Cubans,,they've come to the West for safety.,We throw that away at our peril. 
 And there's one other thingnit reveals about us:,whether we have any humilitynfor our own mistakes.,I'm not one of these people,who believes that all the problemsnin the world are caused by the West.,They're not.,But when we make mistakes,nwe should recognize it.,It's not an accidentnthat the country which has taken,more refugees than any other,nthe United States,,has taken more refugees from Vietnamnthan any other country.,It speaks to the history.,But there's more recent history,nin Iraq and Afghanistan.,You can't make upnfor foreign policy errors,by humanitarian action,,but when you break something,nyou have a duty to try to help repair it,,and that's our duty now. 
 Do you remembernat the beginning of the talk,,I said I wanted to explainnthat the refugee crisis,was manageable, not insoluble?,That's true. I want younto think in a new way,,but I also want you to do things.,If you're an employer,,hire refugees.,If you're persuaded by the arguments,,take on the myths,when family or friendsnor workmates repeat them.,If you've got money, give it to charities,that make a differencenfor refugees around the world.,If you're a citizen,,vote for politicians,who will put into practicenthe solutions that I've talked about. 
 (Applause) 
 The duty to strangers,shows itself,in small ways and big,,prosaic and heroic.,In 1942,,my aunt and my grandmothernwere living in Brussels,under German occupation.,They received a summons,from the Nazi authoritiesnto go to Brussels Railway Station.,My grandmother immediately thoughtnsomething was amiss.,She pleaded with her relatives,not to go to Brussels Railway Station.,Her relatives said to her,,"If we don't go,nif we don't do what we're told,,then we're going to be in trouble.",You can guess what happened,to the relatives who wentnto Brussels Railway Station.,They were never seen again.,But my grandmother and my aunt,,they went to a small village,south of Brussels,where they'd been on holidaynin the decade before,,and they presented themselvesnat the house of the local farmer,,a Catholic farmer called Monsieur Maurice,,and they asked him to take them in.,And he did,,and by the end of the war,,17 Jews, I was told,nwere living in that village. 
 And when I was teenager, I asked my aunt,,"Can you take me to meetnMonsieur Maurice?",And she said, "Yeah, I can.nHe's still alive. Let's go and see him.",And so, it must have been '83, '84,,we went to see him.,And I suppose, like only a teenager could,,when I met him,,he was this white-haired gentleman,,I said to him,,"Why did you do it?,Why did you take that risk?",And he looked at me and he shrugged,,and he said, in French,,"On doit.","One must.",It was innate in him.,It was natural.,And my point to you is it should bennatural and innate in us, too.,Tell yourself,,this refugee crisis is manageable,,not unsolvable,,and each one of us,has a personal responsibilitynto help make it so.,Because this is about the rescuenof us and our values,as well as the rescuenof refugees and their lives. 
 Thank you very much indeed. 
 (Applause) 
 Bruno Giussani: David, thank you.nDavid Miliband: Thank you. 
 BG: Those are strong suggestions,and your call for individualnresponsibility is very strong as well,,but I'm troublednby one thought, and it's this:,you mentioned, and these are your words,n"extraordinary Western leadership",which led 60-something years ago,to the whole discussionnabout human rights,,to the conventions on refugees, etc. etc.,That leadershipnhappened after a big trauma,and happened inna consensual political space,,and now we arenin a divisive political space.,Actually, refugees have becomenone of the divisive issues.,So where will leadership come from today? 
 DM: Well, I think that you're right to say,that the leadership forged in war,has a different tempernand a different tempo,and a different outlook,than leadership forged in peace.,And so my answer would benthe leadership has got to come from below,,not from above.,I mean, a recurring themenof the conference this week,has been aboutnthe democratization of power.,And we've got to preservenour own democracies,,but we've got to also activatenour own democracies.,And when people say to me,,"There's a backlash against refugees,",what I say to them is,,"No, there's a polarization,,and at the moment,,those who are fearfulnare making more noise,than those who are proud.",And so my answer to your questionnis that we will sponsor and encourage,and give confidence to leadership,when we mobilize ourselves.,And I think that when you arenin a position of looking for leadership,,you have to look inside,and mobilize in your own community,to try to create conditionsnfor a different kind of settlement. 
 BG: Thank you, David.nThanks for coming to TED. 
 (Applause)The youthful perspective on the future,,the present perspective on the future,and the future, maturenperspective on the future --,I'd like to try and bringnall those three tenses together,in one identity tonight.,And you could saynthat the poet, in many ways,,looks at what I calln"the conversational nature of reality.",And you ask yourself:,What is the conversationalnnature of reality?,The conversational naturenof reality is the fact,that whatever you desire of the world --,whatever you desire of your partnernin a marriage or a love relationship,,whatever you desire of your children,,whatever you desire of the peoplenwho work for you or with you,,or your world --,will not happen exactlynas you would like it to happen. 
 But equally,,whatever the world desires of us --,whatever our partner,nour child, our colleague,,our industry,,our future demands of us,,will also not happen.,And what actually happens,is this frontiernbetween what you think is you,and what you think is not you.,And this frontier of actual meeting,between what we call a selfnand what we call the world,is the only place, actually,nwhere things are real. 
 But it's quite astonishing,,how little time we spendnat this conversational frontier,,and not abstracted away from itnin one strategy or another.,I was coming through immigration,,which is quite a dramaticnborder at the moment,,into the US last year,,and, you know, you get offnan international flight,across the Atlantic,,and you're not in the best place;,you're not at your mostnspiritually mature.,You're quite impatientnwith the rest of humanity, in fact.,So when you get up to immigrationnwith your shirt collar out,and a day's growth of beard,,and you have very little patience,,and the immigration officernlooked at my passport,and said, "What do you do, Mr. Whyte?",I said, "I work with the conversationalnnature of reality." 
 (Laughter) 
 And he leaned forward over his podium,and he said, "I needed you last night." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 And I said, "I'm sorry,,my powers as a poetnand philosopher only go so far.,I'm not sure I can --",But before we knew it,,we were into a conversationnabout his marriage.,Here he was in his uniform,,and the interesting thing was,,he was looking up and downnthe row of officers,to make sure his supervisor didn't see,that we was having a real conversation.,But all of us livenat this conversational frontier,with the future. 
 I'd like to put you in the shoesnof my Irish niece,,Marlene McCormack,,standing on a cliff edgenon the western coast of Spain,,overlooking the broad Atlantic.,Twenty-three years old,nshe's just walked 500 miles,from Saint Jean Pied de Portnon the French side of the Pyrenees,,all the way across Northern Spain,,on this very famous,nold and contemporary pilgrimage,called the Camino de Santiagonde Compostela --,the Path to Santiago of Compostela.,And when you get to Santiago, actually,,it can be something of an anticlimax,,because there are 100,000npeople living there,who are not necessarily applauding younas you're coming into town. 
 (Laughter) 
 And 10,000 of them are trying to sell youna memento of your journey.,But you do have the possibilitynof going on for three more days,to this place where Marlene stood,ncalled, in Spanish, Finisterre,,in English, Finisterre,,from the Latin,nmeaning "the ends of the earth,",the place where ground turns to ocean;,the place where your presentnturns into the future.,And Marlene had walked this way --,she just graduated as a 23-year-oldnfrom the University of Sligo,with a degree in Irish drama.,And she said to me, "I don't thinknthe major corporations of the world,will be knocking on my door.",I said, "Listen, I've workednin corporations all over the world,for decades;,a degree in drama is what would mostnprepare you for the adult -- 
 (Laughter) 
 corporate world." 
 (Applause) 
 But she said, "I'm notninterested in that, anyway.,I don't want to teach drama,nI want to become a dramatist.,I want to write plays.,So I walked the Caminonin order to give myself some courage,,in order to walk into my future.",And I said, "What was the most powerfulnmoment you had on the whole Camino,,the very most powerful moment?",She said, "I had many powerful moments,,but you know, the most powerfulnmoment was post-Camino,,was the three days you go on from Santiagonand come to this cliff edge.,And you go through three rituals.,The first ritual is to eatna tapas plate of scallops" --,or if you're vegetarian,,to contemplate the scallop shell. 
 (Laughter) 
 Because the scallop shell has beennthe icon and badge of your walk,,and every arrownthat you have seen along that way,has been pointing underneathna scallop shell.,So really, this first ritual is saying:,How did you get to this place?,How did you follow the path to get here?,How do you hold the conversation of lifenwhen you feel unbesieged,,when you're unbullied,,when you're left to yourself?,How do you hold the conversation of lifenthat brings you to this place?,And the second ritual is that you burnnsomething that you've brought.,I said, "What did you burn, Marlene?",She said, "I burned a letternand two postcards.",I said, "Astonishing.,Twenty-three years old and you have paper.,I can't believe it." 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm sure there's a Camino app,where you can just deletena traumatic text, you know? 
 (Laughter) 
 It will engage the flashlight,,imbue it with color,and disappear in a firework of flames.,But you either bring a letternor you write one there,,and you burn it.,And of course we know intuitivelynwhat is on those letters and postcards.,It's a form of affection and loventhat is now no longer extant, yeah? 
 And then the third ritual:,between all these firesnare large piles of clothes.,And you leave an item of clothing,that has helped you to get to this place.,And I said to Marlene,n"What did you leave at the cliff edge?",She said, "I left my boots --,the very thingsnthat I walked in, actually.,They were beautiful boots,nI loved those boots,,but they were finishednafter seven weeks of walking.,So I walked away in my trainers,,but I left my boots there." 
 She said, "It was really incredible.,The most powerful moment was,nthe sun was going down,,but the full moon was coming up behind me.,And the full moon was illuminatednby the dying sun in such a powerful way,that even after the sunnhad dropped below the horizon,,the moon could still see that sun.,And I had a moon shadow,,and I was looking at my moon shadownwalking across the Atlantic,,across this ocean.,And I thought,,'Oh! That's my new selfngoing into the future.',But suddenly I realizednthe sun was falling further.,The moon was losing its reflection,,and my shadow was disappearing.,The most powerful momentnI had on the whole Camino,was when I realized I myselfnhad to walk across that unknown sea,into my future." 
 Well, I was so taken by this story,,I wrote this piece for her.,We were driving at the time;,we got home, I sat on the couch,,I wrote until two in the morning --,everyone had gone to bed --,and I gave it to Marlenenat breakfast time.,It's called, "Finisterre,"nfor Marlene McCormack. 
 "The road in the end 
 the road in the endntaking the path the sun had taken 
 the road in the endntaking the path the run had taken,into the western sea 
 the road in the endntaking the path the sun had taken,into the western sea 
 and the moon 
 the moon rising behind you,as you stood where ground turned to ocean: 
 no way to your future now 
 no way to your future now,except the way your shadow could take,,walking before you across water,ngoing where shadows go, 
 no way to make sense of a worldnthat wouldn't let you pass,except to call an endnto the way you had come,,to take out each letter you had brought,and light their illumined corners;,and to read them as they driftednon the late western light; 
 to empty your bags 
 to empty your bags;,to sort this and to leave that 
 to sort this and to leave that;,to promise what you needednto promise all along 
 to promise what you needednto promise all along,,and to abandon the shoesnthat brought you here,right at the water's edge, 
 not because you had given up 
 not because you had given up,but because now,,you would find a different way to tread,,and because, through it all,,part of you would still walk on,,no matter how,,over the waves." 
 "Finisterre.",For Marlene McCormack -- 
 (Applause) 
 who has already hadnher third play performed,in off-off-off-off-Broadway --,in Dublin. 
 (Laughter) 
 But she's on her way. 
 This is the last piece.,This is about the supposed arrivalnat the sum of all of our endeavors.,In Santiago itself --,it could be Santiago,,it could be Mecca,,it could be Varanasi,,it could be Kyoto,,it could be that thresholdnyou've set for yourself,,the disturbing approachnto the consummation of all your goals. 
 And one of the difficultiesnabout walking into your life,,about coming into this body,,into this world fully,,is you start to realize,that you have manufacturednthree abiding illusions,that the rest of humanity has sharednwith you since the beginning of time. 
 And the first illusionnis that you can somehow construct a life,in which you are not vulnerable.,You can somehow be immunento all of the difficulties,and ill health and losses,that humanity has been subject tonsince the beginning of time.,If we look out at the natural world,,there's no part of that world,that doesn't go through cyclesnof, first, incipience,,or hiddenness,,but then growth, fullness,,but then a beautiful,nto begin with, disappearance,,and then a very austere,nfull disappearance.,We look at that, we say,n"That's beautiful,,but can I just have the first halfnof the equation, please?,And when the disappearance is happening,,I'll close my eyes and waitnfor the new cycle to come around.",Which means most human beingsnare at war with reality,50 percent of the time.,The mature identity,is able to live in the full cycle. 
 The second illusion is,,I can construct a lifenin which I will not have my heart broken.,Romance is the first placenwe start to do it.,When you're at the beginningnof a new romance or a new marriage,,you say, "I have found the personnwho will not break my heart.",I'm sorry;,you have chosen them out unconsciouslynfor that exact core competency. 
 (Laughter) 
 They will break your heart.,Why?,Because you care about them.,You look at parenting, yeah?,Parenting: "I will benthe perfect mother and father.",Your children will break your heart.,And they don't even have to donanything spectacular or dramatic.,But usually, they do do somethingnspectacular or dramatic -- 
 (Laughter) 
 to break your heart.,And then they live with younas spies and saboteurs for years,,watching your every psychological move,,and spotting your every weakness.,And one day,,when they're about 14 years old,,with your back turned to them,,in the kitchen,,while you're making something for them -- 
 (Laughter) 
 the psychological stiletto goes in. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 And you say, "How did you knownexactly where to place it?" 
 (Laughter) 
 And they say,,"I've been watching you for -- 
 (Laughter) 
 a good few years." 
 And then we hope that our armored,nprofessional personalities,will prevent us from having ournheart broken in work.,But if you're sincere about your work,,it should break your heart.,You should get to thresholds,where you do not know how to proceed.,You do not know how to getnfrom here to there.,What does that do?,It puts you into a propernrelationship with reality.,Why?,Because you have to ask for help. 
 Heartbreak.,We don't have a choice about heartbreak,,we only have a choicenof having our hearts broken,over people and things and projectsnthat we deeply care about. 
 And the last illusion is,,I can somehow plan enoughnand arrange things,that I will be able to seenthe path to the end,right from where I'm standing,,right to the horizon.,But when you think about it,,the only environmentnin which that would be true,would be a flat desert,,empty of any other life.,But even in a flat desert,,the curvature of the earthnwould take the path away from you.,So, no;,you see the path,,and then you don't,and then you see it again. 
 So this is "Santiago,",the supposed arrival,,which is a kind of returnnto the beginning all at the same time.,We have this experience of the journey,,which is in all of our greatnspiritual traditions,,of pilgrimage.,But just by actually standingnin the ground of your life fully,,not trying to abstract yourselfninto a strategic future,that's actually just an escapenfrom present heartbreak;,the ability to standnin the ground of your life,and to look at the horizonnthat is pulling you --,in that moment,,you are the whole journey.,You are the whole conversation. 
 "Santiago." 
 "The road seen, then not seen 
 the road seen, then not seen 
 the hillside hiding then revealingnthe way you should take 
 the road seen, then not seen 
 the hillside hiding then revealingnthe way you should take,,the road dropping away from you,as if leaving you to walk on thin air,,then catching you,,catching you,,holding you up,nwhen you thought you would fall, 
 catching you,,holding you up,nwhen you thought you would fall, 
 and the way forward 
 the way forward always in the end,the way that you came, 
 the way forward always in the end,the way that you came,,the way that you followed,nthe way that carried you into your future,,that brought you to this place, 
 that brought you to this place,,no matter that it sometimesnhad to take your promise from you,,no matter that it alwaysnhad to break your heart along the way: 
 the sense,the sense of having walkednfrom deep inside yourself,out into the revelation,,to have risked yourself,for something that seemed to standnboth inside you and far beyond you,,and that called you back in the end,to the only road you could follow,,walking as you did, in your rags of love 
 walking as you did, in your rags of love,and speaking in the voice that by nightnbecame a prayer for safe arrival,,so that one day 
 one day you realized,that what you wantednhad actually already happened 
 one day you realized,that what you wantednhad actually already happened,and long ago,and in the dwelling placenin which you lived before you began,,and that 
 and that every step along the way,,every step along the way,,you had carried the heartnand the mind and the promise,that first set you offnand then drew you on,,and that 
 and that you were more marvelous,in your simple wish to find a way 
 you were more marvelousnin your simple wish to find a way,than the gilded roofsnof any destination you could reach 
 you were more marvelousnin that simple wish to find a way,than the gilded roofsnof any destination you could reach:,as if, all along,,you had thought the end pointnmight be a city with golden domes,,and cheering crowds,,and turning the corner,at what you thoughtnwas the end of the road,,you found just a simple reflection,,and a clear revelationnbeneath the face looking back,and beneath it another invitation,,all in one glimpse 
 all in one glimpse:,like a person 
 like a person or a placenyou had sought forever 
 like a person or a placenyou had sought forever,,like a bold field of freedomnthat beckoned you beyond;,like another life 
 like another life,,and the road,the road still stretching on."

 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you very much. Thank you. 
 You're very kind. Thank you. 
 (Applause)After decades of research,and billions of dollarsnspent in clinical trials,,we still have a problemnwith cancer drug delivery.,We still give patients chemotherapy,,which is so non-specific,that even thoughnit kills the cancer cells,,it kind of killsnthe rest of your body, too.,And yes, we have developednmore selective drugs,,but it's still a challengento get them into the tumor,,and they end up accumulatingnin the other organs as well,or passing through your urine,,which is a total waste.,And fields like mine have emerged,where we try to encapsulate these drugs,to protect them as theyntravel through the body.,But these modifications cause problems,that we make more modifications to fix. 
 So what I'm really trying to saynis we need a better drug delivery system.,And I propose,,rather than using solely human design,,why not use nature's? 
 Immune cells are these versatile vehiclesnthat travel throughout our body,,patrolling for signs of disease,and arriving at a woundnmere minutes after injury.,So I ask you guys:,If immune cells are already travelingnto places of injury or disease,in our bodies,,why not add an extra passenger?,Why not use immune cells to deliver drugs,to cure some of our biggest problems,in disease? 
 I am a biomedical engineer,,and I want to tell you guys a storynabout how I use immune cells,to target one of the largestnproblems in cancer.,Did you know that over 90 percentnof cancer deaths,can be attributed to its spread?,So if we can stop these cancer cells,from going from the primary tumornto a distant site,,we can stop cancer right in its tracks,and give people more of their lives back. 
 To do this special mission,,we decided to deliverna nanoparticle made of lipids,,which are the same materialsnthat compose your cell membrane.,And we've added two special molecules.,One is called e-selectin,,which acts as a glue,that binds the nanoparticlento the immune cell.,And the second one is called trail.,Trail is a therapeutic drugnthat kills cancer cells,but not normal cells.,Now, when you put both of these together,,you have a mean killing machine on wheels. 
 To test this, we rannan experiment in a mouse.,So what we did was we injectednthe nanoparticles,,and they bound almost immediatelynto the immune cells in the bloodstream.,And then we injected the cancer cellsnto mimic a process,through which cancer cellsnspread throughout our bodies.,And we found something very exciting.,We found that in our treated group,,over 75 percent of the cancer cellsnwe initially injected were dead or dying,,in comparison to only around 25 percent.,So just imagine: these fewernamount of cells were available,to actually be able to spreadnto a different part of the body.,And this is only afterntwo hours of treatment. 
 Our results were amazing,nand we had some pretty interesting press.,My favorite title was actually,,"Sticky balls may stopnthe spread of cancer." 
 (Laughter) 
 I can't tell you just how smugnmy male colleagues were,,knowing that their sticky ballsnmight one day cure cancer. 
 (Laughter) 
 But I can tell you they madensome pretty, pretty, exciting,,pretty ballsy t-shirts. 
 This was also my first experiencentalking to patients,where they asked how soonnour therapy would be available.,And I keep these stories with mento remind me of the importance,of the science,nthe scientists and the patients. 
 Now, our fast-acting resultsnwere pretty interesting,,but we still had one lingering question:,Can our sticky balls,,our particles actually attachednto the immune cells,,actually stop the spread of cancer?,So we went to our animal model,nand we found three important parts.,Our primary tumors were smallernin our treated animals,,there were fewer cells in circulation,,and there was little to nontumor burden in the distant organs. 
 Now, this wasn't just a victorynfor us and our sticky balls.,This was also a victory to me,in drug delivery,,and it represents a paradigm shift,,a revolution --,to go from just using drugs,njust injecting them,and hoping they go to the rightnplaces in the body,,to using immune cellsnas special delivery drivers in your body.,For this example, we used two molecules,ne-selectin and trail,,but really, the possibilitynof drugs you can use are endless. 
 And I talked about cancer,,but where disease goes,nso do immune cells.,So this could be used for any disease.,Imagine using immune cellsnto deliver crucial wound-healing agents,after a spinal cord injury,,or using immune cells to deliver drugsnpast the blood-brain barrier,to treat Parkinson'snor Alzheimer's disease. 
 These are the ideas that excite menabout science the most.,And from where I stand,nI see so much promise and opportunity. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Chris Anderson:nElon, hey, welcome back to TED.,It's great to have you here. 
 Elon Musk: Thanks for having me. 
 CA: So, in the next half hour or so,,we're going to spend some time,exploring your vision for whatnan exciting future might look like,,which I guess makesnthe first question a little ironic:,Why are you boring? 
 EM: Yeah.,I ask myself that frequently.,We're trying to dig a hole under LA,,and this is to create the beginning,of what will hopefullynbe a 3D network of tunnels,to alleviate congestion.,So right now, one of the mostnsoul-destroying things is traffic.,It affects peoplenin every part of the world.,It takes away so much of your life.,It's horrible.,It's particularly horrible in LA. 
 (Laughter) 
 CA: I think you've brought with you,the first visualizationnthat's been shown of this.,Can I show this? 
 EM: Yeah, absolutely.nSo this is the first time --,Just to show what we're talking about.,So a couple of key thingsnthat are important,in having a 3D tunnel network.,First of all, you have to be able,to integrate the entrancenand exit of the tunnel,seamlessly into the fabric of the city.,So by having an elevator,,sort of a car skate,nthat's on an elevator,,you can integrate the entrancenand exits to the tunnel network,just by using two parking spaces.,And then the car gets on a skate.,There's no speed limit here,,so we're designing this to be ablento operate at 200 kilometers an hour. 
 CA: How much? 
 EM: 200 kilometers an hour,nor about 130 miles per hour.,So you should be ablento get from, say, Westwood to LAX,in six minutes -- five, six minutes. 
 (Applause) 
 CA: So possibly, initially done,,it's like on a sortnof toll road-type basis. 
 EM: Yeah. 
 CA: Which, I guess,nalleviates some traffic,from the surface streets as well. 
 EM: So, I don't knownif people noticed it in the video,,but there's no real limitnto how many levels of tunnel you can have.,You can go much further deepnthan you can go up.,The deepest mines are much deepernthan the tallest buildings are tall,,so you can alleviate any arbitrarynlevel of urban congestion,with a 3D tunnel network.,This is a very important point.,So a key rebuttal to the tunnelsnis that if you add one layer of tunnels,,that will simply alleviate congestion,nit will get used up,,and then you'll be back where you started,nback with congestion.,But you can go to anynarbitrary number of tunnels,,any number of levels. 
 CA: But people -- seen traditionally,nit's incredibly expensive to dig,,and that would block this idea. 
 EM: Yeah.,Well, they're right.,To give you an example,nthe LA subway extension,,which is -- I think it'sna two-and-a-half mile extension,that was just completednfor two billion dollars.,So it's roughly a billion dollars a milento do the subway extension in LA.,And this is not the highestnutility subway in the world.,So yeah, it's quite difficultnto dig tunnels normally.,I think we need to havenat least a tenfold improvement,in the cost per mile of tunneling. 
 CA: And how could you achieve that? 
 EM: Actually, if you just do two things,,you can get to approximatelynan order of magnitude improvement,,and I think you can go beyond that.,So the first thing to donis to cut the tunnel diameter,by a factor of two or more.,So a single road lane tunnelnaccording to regulations,has to be 26 feet,nmaybe 28 feet in diameter,to allow for crashesnand emergency vehicles,and sufficient ventilationnfor combustion engine cars.,But if you shrink that diameternto what we're attempting,,which is 12 feet, which is plentynto get an electric skate through,,you drop the diameter by a factor of two,and the cross-sectional areanby a factor of four,,and the tunneling cost scalesnwith the cross-sectional area.,So that's roughly a half-ordernof magnitude improvement right there.,Then tunneling machines currently tunnelnfor half the time, then they stop,,and then the rest of the timenis putting in reinforcements,for the tunnel wall.,So if you design the machine instead,to do continuousntunneling and reinforcing,,that will give youna factor of two improvement.,Combine that and that's a factor of eight.,Also these machines are far from beingnat their power or thermal limits,,so you can jack up the powernto the machine substantially.,I think you can getnat least a factor of two,,maybe a factor of four or fivenimprovement on top of that.,So I think there's a fairlynstraightforward series of steps,to get somewhere in excessnof an order of magnitude improvement,in the cost per mile,,and our target actually is --,we've got a pet snail called Gary,,this is from Gary the snailnfrom "South Park,",I mean, sorry, "SpongeBob SquarePants." 
 (Laughter) 
 So Gary is capable of --,currently he's capablenof going 14 times faster,than a tunnel-boring machine. 
 (Laughter) 
 CA: You want to beat Gary. 
 EM: We want to beat Gary. 
 (Laughter) 
 He's not a patient little fellow,,and that will be victory.,Victory is beating the snail. 
 CA: But a lot of people imagining,ndreaming about future cities,,they imagine that actuallynthe solution is flying cars, drones, etc.,You go aboveground.,Why isn't that a better solution?,You save all that tunneling cost. 
 EM: Right. I'm in favor of flying things.,Obviously, I do rockets,nso I like things that fly.,This is not some inherent biasnagainst flying things,,but there is a challenge with flying cars,in that they'll be quite noisy,,the wind force generatednwill be very high.,Let's just say that if something'snflying over your head,,a whole bunch of flying carsngoing all over the place,,that is not an anxiety-reducing situation. 
 (Laughter) 
 You don't think to yourself,n"Well, I feel better about today.",You're thinking,n"Did they service their hubcap,,or is it going to come offnand guillotine me?",Things like that. 
 CA: So you've got this vision,of future cities with these rich,n3D networks of tunnels underneath.,Is there a tie-in here with Hyperloop?,Could you apply these tunnelsnto use for this Hyperloop idea,you released a few years ago. 
 EM: Yeah, so we've beennsort of puttering around,with the Hyperloop stuff for a while.,We built a Hyperloop test tracknadjacent to SpaceX,,just for a student competition,,to encourage innovativenideas in transport.,And it actually ends up beingnthe biggest vacuum chamber in the world,after the Large Hadron Collider,,by volume.,So it was quite fun to do that,nbut it was kind of a hobby thing,,and then we think we might --,so we've built a little pusher carnto push the student pods,,but we're going to try seeingnhow fast we can make the pusher go,if it's not pushing something.,So we're cautiously optimistic,we'll be able to be fasternthan the world's fastest bullet train,even in a .8-mile stretch. 
 CA: Whoa. Good brakes. 
 EM: Yeah, I mean, it's -- yeah.,It's either going to smashninto tiny pieces or go quite fast. 
 CA: But you can picture,nthen, a Hyperloop in a tunnel,running quite long distances. 
 EM: Exactly.,And looking at tunneling technology,,it turns out thatnin order to make a tunnel,,you have to --,In order to seal against the water table,,you've got to typically designna tunnel wall to be good,to about five or six atmospheres.,So to go to vacuum is only one atmosphere,,or near-vacuum.,So actually, it sort of turns outnthat automatically,,if you build a tunnel that is good enoughnto resist the water table,,it is automaticallyncapable of holding vacuum. 
 CA: Huh. 
 EM: So, yeah. 
 CA: And so you could actually picture,,what kind of length tunnelnis in Elon's future to running Hyperloop? 
 EM: I think there's no real length limit.,You could dig as much as you want.,I think if you were to do something,like a DC-to-New York Hyperloop,,I think you'd probably wantnto go underground the entire way,because it's a high-density area.,You're going underna lot of buildings and houses,,and if you go deep enough,,you cannot detect the tunnel.,Sometimes people think,nwell, it's going to be pretty annoying,to have a tunnel dug under my house.,Like, if that tunnel is dug,more than about three or fourntunnel diameters beneath your house,,you will not be ablento detect it being dug at all.,In fact, if you're ablento detect the tunnel being dug,,whatever device you are using,,you can get a lot of moneynfor that device from the Israeli military,,who is trying to detectntunnels from Hamas,,and from the US Customs and Border patrolnthat try and detect drug tunnels.,So the reality is,that earth is incredibly goodnat absorbing vibrations,,and once the tunnel depthnis below a certain level,,it is undetectable.,Maybe if you have a very sensitivenseismic instrument,,you might be able to detect it. 
 CA: So you've startedna new company to do this,called The Boring Company.,Very nice. Very funny. 
 (Laughter) 
 EM: What's funny about that? 
 (Laughter) 
 CA: How much of your time is this? 
 EM: It's maybe ...,two or three percent. 
 CA: You've bought a hobby.,This is what an Elon Musknhobby looks like. 
 (Laughter) 
 EM: I mean, it really is, like --,This is basically internsnand people doing it part time.,We bought some second-hand machinery.,It's kind of puttering along,nbut it's making good progress, so -- 
 CA: So an even bigger part of your time,is being spent on electrifyingncars and transport through Tesla.,Is one of the motivationsnfor the tunneling project,the realization that actually,,in a world where cars are electricnand where they're self-driving,,there may end up beingnmore cars on the roads,on any given hour than there are now? 
 EM: Yeah, exactly.,A lot of people thinknthat when you make cars autonomous,,they'll be able to go fasternand that will alleviate congestion.,And to some degree that will be true,,but once you have shared autonomynwhere it's much cheaper to go by car,and you can go point to point,,the affordability of going in a carnwill be better than that of a bus.,Like, it will cost less than a bus ticket.,So the amount of driving that will occurnwill be much greater with shared autonomy,,and actually traffic will get far worse. 
 CA: You started Teslanwith the goal of persuading the world,that electrificationnwas the future of cars,,and a few years ago,npeople were laughing at you.,Now, not so much. 
 EM: OK. 
 (Laughter) 
 I don't know. I don't know. 
 CA: But isn't it true that pretty muchnevery auto manufacturer,has announcednserious electrification plans,for the short- to medium-term future? 
 EM: Yeah. Yeah.,I think almost every automakernhas some electric vehicle program.,They vary in seriousness.,Some are very seriousnabout transitioning entirely to electric,,and some are just dabbling in it.,And some, amazingly,nare still pursuing fuel cells,,but I think that won't last much longer. 
 CA: But isn't there a sense, though, Elon,,where you can now just declare victorynand say, you know, "We did it.",Let the world electrify,nand you go on and focus on other stuff? 
 EM: Yeah.,I intend to stay with Teslanas far into the future as I can imagine,,and there are a lot of excitingnthings that we have coming.,Obviously the Model 3 is coming soon.,We'll be unveiling the Tesla Semi truck. 
 CA: OK, we're going to come to this.,So Model 3, it's supposednto be coming in July-ish. 
 EM: Yeah, it's looking quite goodnfor starting production in July. 
 CA: Wow.,One of the thingsnthat people are so excited about,is the fact that it's got autopilot.,And you put out this video a while back,showing what that technologynwould look like. 
 EM: Yeah. 
 CA: There's obviously autopilotnin Model S right now.,What are we seeing here? 
 EM: Yeah, so this is usingnonly cameras and GPS.,So there's no LIDARnor radar being used here.,This is just using passive optical,nwhich is essentially what a person uses.,The whole road systemnis meant to be navigated,with passive optical, or cameras,,and so once you solve cameras,or vision,,then autonomy is solved.,If you don't solve vision,nit's not solved.,So that's why our focus isnso heavily on having a vision neural net,that's very effective for road conditions. 
 CA: Right. Many other peoplenare going the LIDAR route.,You want cameras plus radar is most of it. 
 EM: You can absolutelynbe superhuman with just cameras.,Like, you can probably do itnten times better than humans would,,just cameras. 
 CA: So the new cars being sold right nownhave eight cameras in them.,They can't yet do what that showed.,When will they be able to? 
 EM: I think we're still on tracknfor being able to go cross-country,from LA to New York by the endnof the year, fully autonomous. 
 CA: OK, so by the endnof the year, you're saying,,someone's going to sit in a Teslanwithout touching the steering wheel,,tap in "New York," off it goes. 
 EM: Yeah. 
 CA: Won't ever have to touch the wheel --nby the end of 2017. 
 EM: Yeah. Essentially,nNovember or December of this year,,we should be able to go all the waynfrom a parking lot in California,to a parking lot in New York,,no controls touched at any pointnduring the entire journey. 
 (Applause) 
 CA: Amazing.,But part of that is possible,because you've already got a fleetnof Teslas driving all these roads.,You're accumulating a huge amountnof data of that national road system. 
 EM: Yes, but the thingnthat will be interesting,is that I'm actually fairly confidentnit will be able to do that route,even if you change the route dynamically.,So, it's fairly easy --,If you say I'm going to be really goodnat one specific route, that's one thing,,but it should be able to go,nreally be very good,,certainly once you enter a highway,,to go anywhere on the highway system,in a given country.,So it's not sort of limitednto LA to New York.,We could change itnand make it Seattle-Florida,,that day, in real time.,So you were going from LA to New York.,Now go from LA to Toronto. 
 CA: So leaving asidenregulation for a second,,in terms of the technology alone,,the time when someonenwill be able to buy one of your cars,and literally just take the handsnoff the wheel and go to sleep,and wake up and find that they've arrived,,how far away is that, to do that safely? 
 EM: I think that's about two years.,So the real trick of itnis not how do you make it work,say 99.9 percent of the time,,because, like, if a car crashesnone in a thousand times,,then you're probably still not goingnto be comfortable falling asleep.,You shouldn't be, certainly. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's never going to be perfect.,No system is going to be perfect,,but if you say it's perhaps --,the car is unlikely to crash,in a hundred lifetimes,nor a thousand lifetimes,,then people are like, OK, wow,nif I were to live a thousand lives,,I would still most likelynnever experience a crash,,then that's probably OK. 
 CA: To sleep.,I guess the big concern of yoursnis that people may actually,get seduced too earlynto think that this is safe,,and that you'll have some horriblenincident happen that puts things back. 
 EM: Well, I think that the autonomy systemnis likely to at least mitigate the crash,,except in rare circumstances.,The thing to appreciatenabout vehicle safety,is this is probabilistic.,I mean, there's some chance that any timena human driver gets in a car,,that they will have an accidentnthat is their fault.,It's never zero.,So really the key threshold for autonomy,is how much better does autonomynneed to be than a person,before you can rely on it? 
 CA: But once you getnliterally safe hands-off driving,,the power to disruptnthe whole industry seems massive,,because at that point you've spokennof people being able to buy a car,,drops you off at work,nand then you let it go,and provide a sort of Uber-likenservice to other people,,earn you money,,maybe even cover the costnof your lease of that car,,so you can kind of get a car for free.,Is that really likely? 
 EM: Yeah. Absolutelynthis is what will happen.,So there will be a shared autonomy fleet,where you buy your car,and you can choosento use that car exclusively,,you could choose to have it be usednonly by friends and family,,only by other driversnwho are rated five star,,you can choose to share it sometimesnbut not other times.,That's 100 percent what will occur.,It's just a question of when. 
 CA: Wow.,So you mentioned the Semi,and I think you're planningnto announce this in September,,but I'm curious whether there'snanything you could show us today? 
 EM: I will show youna teaser shot of the truck. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's alive. 
 CA: OK. 
 EM: That's definitely a casenwhere we want to be cautious,about the autonomy features.,Yeah. 
 (Laughter) 
 CA: We can't see that much of it,,but it doesn't look likenjust a little friendly neighborhood truck.,It looks kind of badass.,What sort of semi is this? 
 EM: So this is a heavy duty,nlong-range semitruck.,So it's the highest weight capability,and with long range.,So essentially it's meant to alleviatenthe heavy-duty trucking loads.,And this is something whichnpeople do not today think is possible.,They think the truck doesn't have enoughnpower or it doesn't have enough range,,and then with the Tesla Semi,we want to show that no, an electric truck,actually can out-torque any diesel semi.,And if you had a tug-of-war competition,,the Tesla Seminwill tug the diesel semi uphill. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 CA: That's pretty cool.nAnd short term, these aren't driverless.,These are going to be trucksnthat truck drivers want to drive. 
 EM: Yes. So what will benreally fun about this,is you have a flat torque RPM curvenwith an electric motor,,whereas with a diesel motor or any kindnof internal combustion engine car,,you've got a torque RPM curventhat looks like a hill.,So this will be a very spry truck.,You can drive thisnaround like a sports car.,There's no gears.nIt's, like, single speed. 
 CA: There's a great moviento be made here somewhere.,I don't know what it isnand I don't know that it ends well,,but it's a great movie. 
 (Laughter) 
 EM: It's quite bizarre test-driving.,When I was driving the test prototypenfor the first truck.,It's really weird,nbecause you're driving around,and you're just so nimble,nand you're in this giant truck. 
 CA: Wait, you'venalready driven a prototype? 
 EM: Yeah, I drove itnaround the parking lot,,and I was like, this is crazy. 
 CA: Wow. This is no vaporware. 
 EM: It's just like,ndriving this giant truck,and making these mad maneuvers. 
 CA: This is cool.nOK, from a really badass picture,to a kind of less badass picture.,This is just a cute housenfrom "Desperate Housewives" or something.,What on earth is going on here? 
 EM: Well, this illustratesnthe picture of the future,that I think is how things will evolve.,You've got an electric carnin the driveway.,If you look in betweennthe electric car and the house,,there are actually three Powerwallsnstacked up against the side of the house,,and then that house roof is a solar roof.,So that's an actual solar glass roof. 
 CA: OK. 
 EM: That's a picture of a real --nwell, admittedly, it's a real fake house.,That's a real fake house. 
 (Laughter) 
 CA: So these roof tiles,,some of them have in themnbasically solar power, the ability to -- 
 EM: Yeah. Solar glass tiles,where you can adjustnthe texture and the color,to a very fine-grained level,,and then there'snsort of microlouvers in the glass,,such that when you're lookingnat the roof from street level,or close to street level,,all the tiles look the same,whether there is a solar cellnbehind it or not.,So you have an even color,from the ground level.,If you were to look at itnfrom a helicopter,,you would be actually ablento look through and see,that some of the glass tiles havena solar cell behind them and some do not.,You can't tell from street level. 
 CA: You put them in the onesnthat are likely to see a lot of sun,,and that makes these roofsnsuper affordable, right?,They're not that much more expensiventhan just tiling the roof. 
 EM: Yeah.,We're very confidentnthat the cost of the roof,plus the cost of electricity --,A solar glass roof will be lessnthan the cost of a normal roof,plus the cost of electricity.,So in other words,,this will be economically a no-brainer,,we think it will look great,,and it will last --,We thought about havingnthe warranty be infinity,,but then people thought,,well, that might soundnlike were just talking rubbish,,but actually this is toughened glass.,Well after the house has collapsed,and there's nothing there,,the glass tiles will still be there. 
 (Applause) 
 CA: I mean, this is cool.,So you're rolling this outnin a couple week's time, I think,,with four different roofing types. 
 EM: Yeah, we're starting offnwith two, two initially,,and the second twonwill be introduced early next year. 
 CA: And what's the scale of ambition here?,How many houses do you believencould end up having this type of roofing? 
 EM: I think eventually,almost all houses will have a solar roof.,The thing is to considernthe time scale here,to be probably on the order,of 40 or 50 years.,So on average, a roofnis replaced every 20 to 25 years.,But you don't start replacingnall roofs immediately.,But eventually,nif you say were to fast-forward,to say 15 years from now,,it will be unusual to have a roofnthat does not have solar. 
 CA: Is there a mental model thingnthat people don't get here,that because of the shift in the cost,nthe economics of solar power,,most houses actually havenenough sunlight on their roof,pretty much to power all of their needs.,If you could capture the power,,it could pretty muchnpower all their needs.,You could go off-grid, kind of. 
 EM: It depends on where you are,and what the house size isnrelative to the roof area,,but it's a fair statement to say,that most houses in the USnhave enough roof area,to power all the needs of the house. 
 CA: So the key to the economics,of the cars, the Semi, of these houses,is the falling pricenof lithium-ion batteries,,which you've made a huge bet on as Tesla.,In many ways, that's almostnthe core competency.,And you've decided,that to really, like, own that competency,,you just have to buildnthe world's largest manufacturing plant,to double the world's supplynof lithium-ion batteries,,with this guy. What is this? 
 EM: Yeah, so that's the Gigafactory,,progress so far on the Gigafactory.,Eventually, you can sort of roughly see,that there's sort ofna diamond shape overall,,and when it's fully done,nit'll look like a giant diamond,,or that's the idea behind it,,and it's aligned on true north.,It's a small detail. 
 CA: And capable of producing, eventually,,like a hundred gigawatt hoursnof batteries a year. 
 EM: A hundred gigawatt hours.nWe think probably more, but yeah. 
 CA: And they're actuallynbeing produced right now. 
 EM: They're in production already.nCA: You guys put out this video.,I mean, is that speeded up? 
 EM: That's the slowed down version. 
 (Laughter) 
 CA: How fast does it actually go? 
 EM: Well, when it's running at full speed,,you can't actually see the cellsnwithout a strobe light.,It's just blur. 
 (Laughter) 
 CA: One of your core ideas, Elon,nabout what makes an exciting future,is a future where we no longernfeel guilty about energy.,Help us picture this.,How many Gigafactories, if you like,ndoes it take to get us there? 
 EM: It's about a hundred, roughly.,It's not 10, it's not a thousand.,Most likely a hundred. 
 CA: See, I find this amazing.,You can picture what it would take,to move the worldnoff this vast fossil fuel thing.,It's like you're building one,,it costs five billion dollars,,or whatever, five to 10 billion dollars.,Like, it's kind of coolnthat you can picture that project.,And you're planning to do, at Tesla --nannounce another two this year. 
 EM: I think we'll announce locations,for somewhere between twonand four Gigafactories later this year.,Yeah, probably four. 
 CA: Whoa. 
 (Applause),No more teasing from you for here?,Like -- where, continent?,You can say no. 
 EM: We need to address a global market. 
 CA: OK. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is cool.,I think we should talk for --,Actually, double mark it.,I'm going to ask you one questionnabout politics, only one.,I'm kind of sick of politics,nbut I do want to ask you this.,You're on a body nowngiving advice to a guy -- 
 EM: Who? 
 CA: Who has said he doesn'tnreally believe in climate change,,and there's a lot of people out therenwho think you shouldn't be doing that.,They'd like you to walk away from that.,What would you say to them? 
 EM: Well, I think that first of all,,I'm just on two advisory councils,where the format consistsnof going around the room,and asking people's opinion on things,,and so there's like a meetingnevery month or two.,That's the sum total of my contribution.,But I think to the degreenthat there are people in the room,who are arguing in favornof doing something about climate change,,or social issues,,I've used the meetings I've had thus far,to argue in favor of immigrationnand in favor of climate change. 
 (Applause) 
 And if I hadn't done that,,that wasn't on the agenda before.,So maybe nothing will happen,nbut at least the words were said. 
 CA: OK. 
 (Applause) 
 So let's talk SpaceX and Mars.,Last time you were here,,you spoke about what seemed likena kind of incredibly ambitious dream,to develop rocketsnthat were actually reusable.,And you've only gone and done it. 
 EM: Finally. It took a long time. 
 CA: Talk us through this.nWhat are we looking at here? 
 EM: So this is one of our rocket boosters,coming back fromnvery high and fast in space.,So just delivered the upper stage,at high velocity.,I think this might have beennat sort of Mach 7 or so,,delivery of the upper stage. 
 (Applause) 
 CA: So that was a sped-up -- 
 EM: That was the slowed down version. 
 (Laughter) 
 CA: I thought that wasnthe sped-up version.,But I mean, that's amazing,,and several of these failed,before you finallynfigured out how to do it,,but now you've done this,nwhat, five or six times? 
 EM: We're at eight or nine. 
 CA: And for the first time,,you've actually reflownnone of the rockets that landed. 
 EM: Yeah, so we landed the rocket booster,and then prepped it for flight againnand flew it again,,so it's the first reflightnof an orbital booster,where that reflight is relevant.,So it's important to appreciatenthat reusability is only relevant,if it is rapid and complete.,So like an aircraft or a car,,the reusability is rapid and complete.,You do not send your aircraftnto Boeing in-between flights. 
 CA: Right. So this is allowing younto dream of this really ambitious idea,of sending many, many, many people to Mars,in, what, 10 or 20 years time, I guess. 
 EM: Yeah. 
 CA: And you've designednthis outrageous rocket to do it.,Help us understandnthe scale of this thing. 
 EM: Well, visuallynyou can see that's a person.,Yeah, and that's the vehicle. 
 (Laughter) 
 CA: So if that was a skyscraper,,that's like, did I read that,na 40-story skyscraper? 
 EM: Probably a little more, yeah.,The thrust level of this is really --,This configuration is about four timesnthe thrust of the Saturn V moon rocket. 
 CA: Four times the thrust of the biggestnrocket humanity ever created before. 
 EM: Yeah. Yeah. 
 CA: As one does.nEM: Yeah. 
 (Laughter) 
 In units of 747, a 747 is only aboutna quarter of a million pounds of thrust,,so for every 10 million pounds of thrust,,there's 40 747s.,So this would be the thrust equivalentnof 120 747s, with all engines blazing. 
 CA: And so even with a machinendesigned to escape Earth's gravity,,I think you told me last time,this thing could actuallyntake a fully loaded 747,,people, cargo, everything,,into orbit. 
 EM: Exactly. This can takena fully loaded 747 with maximum fuel,,maximum passengers,nmaximum cargo on the 747 --,this can take it as cargo. 
 CA: So based on this,,you presented recentlynthis Interplanetary Transport System,which is visualized this way.,This is a scene you picture in, what,n30 years time? 20 years time?,People walking into this rocket. 
 EM: I'm hopeful it's sort ofnan eight- to 10-year time frame.,Aspirationally, that's our target.,Our internal targetsnare more aggressive, but I think -- 
 (Laughter) 
 CA: OK. 
 EM: While vehicle seems quite large,and is large by comparisonnwith other rockets,,I think the future spacecraft,will make this look like a rowboat.,The future spaceshipsnwill be truly enormous. 
 CA: Why, Elon?,Why do we need to build a city on Mars,with a million peoplenon it in your lifetime,,which I think is kind ofnwhat you've said you'd love to do? 
 EM: I think it's important to have,a future that is inspiring and appealing.,I just think there have to be reasons,that you get up in the morningnand you want to live.,Like, why do you want to live?,What's the point? What inspires you?,What do you love about the future?,And if we're not out there,,if the future does not includenbeing out there among the stars,and being a multiplanet species,,I find that it's incredibly depressing,if that's not the futurenthat we're going to have. 
 (Applause) 
 CA: People want to position thisnas an either or,,that there are so many desperate thingsnhappening on the planet now,from climate to povertynto, you know, you pick your issue.,And this feels like a distraction.,You shouldn't be thinking about this.,You should be solving what's here and now.,And to be fair, you've donena fair old bit to actually do that,with your work on sustainable energy.,But why not just do that? 
 EM: I think there's --,I look at the futurenfrom the standpoint of probabilities.,It's like a branchingnstream of probabilities,,and there are actions that we can takenthat affect those probabilities,or that accelerate one thingnor slow down another thing.,I may introduce something newnto the probability stream.,Sustainable energynwill happen no matter what.,If there was no Tesla,nif Tesla never existed,,it would have to happen out of necessity.,It's tautological.,If you don't have sustainable energy,nit means you have unsustainable energy.,Eventually you will run out,,and the laws of economicsnwill drive civilization,towards sustainable energy,,inevitably.,The fundamental valuenof a company like Tesla,is the degree to which it acceleratesnthe advent of sustainable energy,,faster than it would otherwise occur. 
 So when I think, like,,what is the fundamental goodnof a company like Tesla,,I would say, hopefully,,if it accelerated that by a decade,npotentially more than a decade,,that would be quite a good thing to occur.,That's what I consider to be,the fundamentalnaspirational good of Tesla. 
 Then there's becoming a multiplanetnspecies and space-faring civilization.,This is not inevitable.,It's very important to appreciatenthis is not inevitable.,The sustainable energy futurenI think is largely inevitable,,but being a space-faring civilizationnis definitely not inevitable.,If you look at the progress in space,,in 1969 you were ablento send somebody to the moon.,1969.,Then we had the Space Shuttle.,The Space Shuttle could onlyntake people to low Earth orbit.,Then the Space Shuttle retired,,and the United Statesncould take no one to orbit.,So that's the trend.,The trend is like down to nothing.,People are mistaken when they think,that technologynjust automatically improves.,It does not automatically improve.,It only improves if a lot of peoplenwork very hard to make it better,,and actually it will, I think,nby itself degrade, actually.,You look at great civilizationsnlike Ancient Egypt,,and they were able to make the pyramids,,and they forgot how to do that.,And then the Romans,nthey built these incredible aqueducts.,They forgot how to do it. 
 CA: Elon, it almost seems,nlistening to you,and looking at the differentnthings you've done,,that you've got this uniquendouble motivation on everything,that I find so interesting.,One is this desire to worknfor humanity's long-term good.,The other is the desirento do something exciting.,And often it feels like you feelnlike you need the one to drive the other.,With Tesla, you wantnto have sustainable energy,,so you made these super sexy,nexciting cars to do it.,Solar energy, we need to get there,,so we need to make these beautiful roofs.,We haven't even spokennabout your newest thing,,which we don't have time to do,,but you want to save humanity from bad AI,,and so you're going to createnthis really cool brain-machine interface,to give us all infinite memorynand telepathy and so forth.,And on Mars, it feelsnlike what you're saying is,,yeah, we need to save humanity,and have a backup plan,,but also we need to inspire humanity,,and this is a way to inspire. 
 EM: I think the valuenof beauty and inspiration,is very much underrated,,no question.,But I want to be clear.,I'm not trying to be anyone's savior.,That is not the --,I'm just trying to think about the future,and not be sad. 
 (Applause) 
 CA: Beautiful statement.,I think everyone here would agree,that it is not --,None of this is goingnto happen inevitably.,The fact that in your mind,nyou dream this stuff,,you dream stuff that no one elsenwould dare dream,,or no one elsenwould be capable of dreaming,at the level of complexity that you do.,The fact that you do that, Elon Musk,nis a really remarkable thing.,Thank you for helping us allnto dream a bit bigger. 
 EM: But you'll tell me if it evernstarts getting genuinely insane, right? 
 (Laughter) 
 CA: Thank you, Elon Musk.nThat was really, really fantastic.,That was really fantastic. 
 (Applause)I used to think,the whole purpose of lifenwas pursuing happiness.,Everyone said the pathnto happiness was success,,so I searched for that ideal job,,that perfect boyfriend,nthat beautiful apartment.,But instead of ever feeling fulfilled,,I felt anxious and adrift.,And I wasn't alone; my friends --nthey struggled with this, too. 
 Eventually, I decided to gonto graduate school for positive psychology,to learn what truly makes people happy.,But what I discovered therenchanged my life.,The data showed that chasing happinessncan make people unhappy.,And what really struck me was this:,the suicide rate has been risingnaround the world,,and it recently reachedna 30-year high in America.,Even though life is gettingnobjectively better,by nearly every conceivable standard,,more people feel hopeless,,depressed and alone.,There's an emptinessngnawing away at people,,and you don't have to benclinically depressed to feel it.,Sooner or later, I think we all wonder:,Is this all there is?,And according to the research,nwhat predicts this despair,is not a lack of happiness.,It's a lack of something else,,a lack of having meaning in life. 
 But that raised some questions for me.,Is there more to life than being happy?,And what's the differencenbetween being happy,and having meaning in life?,Many psychologists define happinessnas a state of comfort and ease,,feeling good in the moment.,Meaning, though, is deeper.,The renowned psychologistnMartin Seligman says,meaning comes from belonging tonand serving something beyond yourself,and from developing the best within you.,Our culture is obsessed with happiness,,but I came to see that seeking meaningnis the more fulfilling path.,And the studies show that peoplenwho have meaning in life,,they're more resilient,,they do better in school and at work,,and they even live longer. 
 So this all made me wonder:,How can we each live more meaningfully?,To find out, I spent five yearsninterviewing hundreds of people,and reading through thousandsnof pages of psychology,,neuroscience and philosophy.,Bringing it all together,,I found that there are what I callnfour pillars of a meaningful life.,And we can each create lives of meaning,by building some or allnof these pillars in our lives. 
 The first pillar is belonging.,Belonging comesnfrom being in relationships,where you're valuednfor who you are intrinsically,and where you value others as well.,But some groups and relationshipsndeliver a cheap form of belonging;,you're valued for what you believe,,for who you hate,,not for who you are.,True belonging springs from love.,It lives in moments among individuals,,and it's a choice -- you can choosento cultivate belonging with others. 
 Here's an example.,Each morning, my friend Jonathannbuys a newspaper,from the same street vendor in New York.,They don't just conductna transaction, though.,They take a moment to slow down, talk,,and treat each other like humans.,But one time, Jonathanndidn't have the right change,,and the vendor said,,"Don't worry about it.",But Jonathan insisted on paying,,so he went to the storenand bought something he didn't need,to make change.,But when he gave the money to the vendor,,the vendor drew back.,He was hurt.,He was trying to do something kind,,but Jonathan had rejected him. 
 I think we all reject people in small waysnlike this without realizing it.,I do.,I'll walk by someone I knownand barely acknowledge them.,I'll check my phonenwhen someone's talking to me.,These acts devalue others.,They make them feelninvisible and unworthy.,But when you lead with love,nyou create a bond,that lifts each of you up. 
 For many people, belongingnis the most essential source of meaning,,those bonds to family and friends.,For others, the key to meaningnis the second pillar: purpose.,Now, finding your purposenis not the same thing,as finding that job that makes you happy.,Purpose is less about what you wantnthan about what you give.,A hospital custodian told menher purpose is healing sick people.,Many parents tell me,,"My purpose is raising my children.",The key to purposenis using your strengths to serve others.,Of course, for many of us,nthat happens through work.,That's how we contribute and feel needed.,But that also meansnthat issues like disengagement at work,,unemployment,,low labor force participation --,these aren't just economic problems,nthey're existential ones, too.,Without something worthwhile to do,,people flounder.,Of course, you don't have to findnpurpose at work,,but purpose gives younsomething to live for,,some "why" that drives you forward. 
 The third pillar of meaningnis also about stepping beyond yourself,,but in a completely different way:,transcendence.,Transcendent states are those rare moments,when you're lifted aboventhe hustle and bustle of daily life,,your sense of self fades away,,and you feel connectednto a higher reality.,For one person I talked to,ntranscendence came from seeing art.,For another person, it was at church.,For me, I'm a writer,nand it happens through writing.,Sometimes I get so in the zonenthat I lose all sense of time and place.,These transcendentnexperiences can change you.,One study had students look upnat 200-feet-tall eucalyptus trees,for one minute.,But afterwardsnthey felt less self-centered,,and they even behaved more generously,when given the chance to help someone. 
 Belonging, purpose, transcendence.,Now, the fourth pillarnof meaning, I've found,,tends to surprise people.,The fourth pillar is storytelling,,the story you tell yourselfnabout yourself.,Creating a narrative from the eventsnof your life brings clarity.,It helps you understandnhow you became you.,But we don't always realizenthat we're the authors of our stories,and can change the way we're telling them.,Your life isn't just a list of events.,You can edit, interpretnand retell your story,,even as you're constrained by the facts. 
 I met a young man named Emeka,nwho'd been paralyzed playing football.,After his injury, Emeka told himself,,"My life was great playing football,,but now look at me.",People who tell stories like this --,"My life was good. Now it's bad." --,tend to be more anxious and depressed.,And that was Emeka for a while.,But with time, he startednto weave a different story.,His new story was,,"Before my injury,nmy life was purposeless.,I partied a lot and wasna pretty selfish guy.,But my injury made me realizenI could be a better man.",That edit to his storynchanged Emeka's life.,After telling the new story to himself,,Emeka started mentoring kids,,and he discovered what his purpose was:,serving others.,The psychologist Dan McAdamsncalls this a "redemptive story,",where the bad is redeemed by the good.,People leading meaningfulnlives, he's found,,tend to tell stories about their lives,defined by redemption, growth and love. 
 But what makes peoplenchange their stories?,Some people get help from a therapist,,but you can do it on your own, too,,just by reflectingnon your life thoughtfully,,how your defining experiences shaped you,,what you lost, what you gained.,That's what Emeka did.,You won't change your story overnight;,it could take years and be painful.,After all, we've all suffered,nand we all struggle.,But embracing those painful memoriesncan lead to new insights and wisdom,,to finding that good that sustains you. 
 Belonging, purpose,ntranscendence, storytelling:,those are the four pillars of meaning.,When I was younger,,I was lucky enough to be surroundednby all of the pillars.,My parents ran a Sufi meetinghousenfrom our home in Montreal.,Sufism is a spiritual practicenassociated with the whirling dervishes,and the poet Rumi.,Twice a week, Sufis would come to our home,to meditate, drink Persian tea,nand share stories.,Their practice also involvednserving all of creation,through small acts of love,,which meant being kindneven when people wronged you.,But it gave them a purpose:nto rein in the ego. 
 Eventually, I left home for college,and without the daily groundingnof Sufism in my life,,I felt unmoored.,And I started searching for those thingsnthat make life worth living.,That's what set me on this journey.,Looking back, I now realize,that the Sufi housenhad a real culture of meaning.,The pillars were part of the architecture,,and the presence of the pillarsnhelped us all live more deeply. 
 Of course, the same principle applies,in other strong communities as well --,good ones and bad ones.,Gangs, cults:,these are cultures of meaningnthat use the pillars,and give peoplensomething to live and die for.,But that's exactly why we as a society,must offer better alternatives.,We need to build these pillarsnwithin our families and our institutions,to help people become their best selves.,But living a meaningful life takes work.,It's an ongoing process.,As each day goes by,nwe're constantly creating our lives,,adding to our story.,And sometimes we can get off track. 
 Whenever that happens to me,,I remember a powerful experiencenI had with my father.,Several months afternI graduated from college,,my dad had a massive heart attacknthat should have killed him.,He survived, and when I asked himnwhat was going through his mind,as he faced death,,he said all he could think aboutnwas needing to live,so he could be therenfor my brother and me,,and this gave him the willnto fight for life.,When he went under anesthesianfor emergency surgery,,instead of counting backwards from 10,,he repeated our names like a mantra.,He wanted our names to benthe last words he spoke on earth,if he died. 
 My dad is a carpenter and a Sufi.,It's a humble life,,but a good life.,Lying there facing death,nhe had a reason to live:,love.,His sense of belonging within his family,,his purpose as a dad,,his transcendent meditation,nrepeating our names --,these, he says, are the reasonsnwhy he survived.,That's the story he tells himself. 
 That's the power of meaning.,Happiness comes and goes.,But when life is really good,and when things are really bad,,having meaning gives younsomething to hold on to. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)A little over 100 years ago, in 1915,,Einstein publishednhis theory of general relativity,,which is sort of a strange name,,but it's a theory that explains gravity.,It states that mass -- all matter,nthe planets -- attracts mass,,not because of an instantaneous force,nas Newton claimed,,but because all matter --nall of us, all the planets --,wrinkles the flexible fabricnof space-time. 
 Space-time is this thing in which we livenand that connects us all.,It's like when we lie down on a mattressnand distort its contour.,The masses move -- again,nnot according to Newton's laws,,but because they seenthis space-time curvature,and follow the little curves,,just like when our bedmatennestles up to us,because of the mattress curvature. 
 (Laughter) 
 A year later, in 1916,,Einstein derived from his theory,that gravitational waves existed,,and that these waves were producednwhen masses move,,like, for example, when two starsnrevolve around one another,and create folds in space-timenwhich carry energy from the system,,and the stars move toward each other.,However, he also estimated,that these effects were so minute,,that it would never be possiblento measure them.,I'm going to tell you the story of how,,with the work of hundreds of scientistsnworking in many countries,over the course of many decades,,just recently, in 2015,,we discovered those gravitationalnwaves for the first time. 
 It's a rather long story.,It started 1.3 billion years ago.,A long, long time ago,,in a galaxy far, far away -- 
 (Laughter) 
 two black holes were revolvingnaround one another --,"dancing the tango," I like to say.,It started slowly,,but as they emitted gravitational waves,,they grew closer together,naccelerating in speed,,until, when they were revolvingnat almost the speed of light,,they fused into a single black hole,that had 60 times the mass of the Sun,,but compressedninto the space of 360 kilometers.,That's the size of the state of Louisiana,,where I live.,This incredible effectnproduced gravitational waves,that carried the news of this cosmic hugnto the rest of the universe. 
 It took us a long time to figure outnthe effects of these gravitational waves,,because the way we measure themnis by looking for effects in distances.,We want to measure longitudes, distances.,When these gravitational wavesnpassed by Earth,,which was in 2015,,they produced changes in all distances --,the distances between all of you,nthe distances between you and me,,our heights --,every one of usnstretched and shrank a tiny bit.,The prediction is that the effectnis proportional to the distance.,But it's very small:,even for distances much greaternthan my slight height,,the effect is infinitesimal.,For example, the distancenbetween the Earth and the Sun,changed by one atomic diameter.,How can that be measured?,How could we measure it? 
 Fifty years ago,,some visionary physicistsnat Caltech and MIT --,Kip Thorne, Ron Drever, Rai Weiss --,thought they could preciselynmeasure distances,using lasers that measuredndistances between mirrors,kilometers apart.,It took many years, a lot of worknand many scientists,to develop the technologynand develop the ideas.,And 20 years later,,almost 30 years ago,,they started to build two gravitationalnwave detectors, two interferometers,,in the United States.,Each one is four kilometers long;,one is in Livingston, Louisiana,,in the middle of a beautiful forest,,and the other is in Hanford, Washington,,in the middle of the desert. 
 The interferometers have lasers,that travel from the centernthrough four kilometers in-vacuum,,are reflected in mirrorsnand then they return.,We measure the difference in the distances,between this arm and this arm.,These detectors are very,nvery, very sensitive;,they're the most preciseninstruments in the world.,Why did we make two?,It's because the signalsnthat we want to measure come from space,,but the mirrors are moving all the time,,so in order to distinguishnthe gravitational wave effects --,which are astrophysical effectsnand should show up on the two detectors --,we can distinguish themnfrom the local effects,,which appear separately,neither on one or the other. 
 In September of 2015,,we were finishing installingnthe second-generation technology,in the detectors,,and we still weren't at the optimalnsensitivity that we wanted --,we're still not, even now,ntwo years later --,but we wanted to gather data.,We didn't think we'd see anything,,but we were getting ready to startncollecting a few months' worth of data.,And then nature surprised us. 
 On September 14, 2015,,we saw, in both detectors,,a gravitational wave.,In both detectors, we saw a signal,with cycles that increasednin amplitude and frequency,and then go back down.,And they were the same in both detectors.,They were gravitational waves.,And not only that --nin decoding this type of wave,,we were able to deducenthat they came from black holes,fusing together to make one,,more than a billion years ago.,And that was -- 
 (Applause) 
 that was fantastic. 
 At first, we couldn't believe it.,We didn't imaginenthis would happen until much later;,it was a surprise for all of us.,It took us months to convincenourselves that it was true,,because we didn't want to leavenany room for error.,But it was true, and to clear up any doubt,that the detectorsnreally could measure these things,,in December of that same year,,we measured another gravitational wave,,smaller than the first one.,The first gravitational wavenproduced a difference in the distance,of four-thousandths of a proton,over four kilometers.,Yes, the second detection was smaller,,but still very convincingnby our standards.,Despite the fact that these are space-timenwaves and not sound waves,,we like to put them into loudspeakersnand listen to them.,We call this "the music of the universe.",I'd like you to listennto the first two notes of that music. 
 (Chirping sound) 
 (Chirping sound),The second, shorter soundnwas the last fraction of a second,of the two black holes which,,in that fraction of a second,nemitted vast amounts of energy --,so much energy, it was like three Sunsnconverting into energy,,following that famous formula,,E = mc2.,Remember that one?,We love this music so muchnwe actually dance to it.,I'm going to have you listen again. 
 (Chirping sound) 
 (Chirping sound),It's the music of the universe! 
 (Applause) 
 People frequently ask me now:,"What can gravitational wavesnbe used for?,And now that you've discovered them,nwhat else is there left to do?",What can gravitational wavesnbe used for? 
 When they asked Borges,n"What is the purpose of poetry?",he, in turn, answered,,"What's the purpose of dawn?,What's the purpose of caresses?,What's the purposenof the smell of coffee?",He answered,,"The purpose of poetry is pleasure;nit's for emotion, it's for living." 
 And understanding the universe,,this human curiosity for knowingnhow everything works,,is similar.,Since time immemorial, humanity --nall of us, everyone, as kids --,when we look up at the skynfor the first time and see the stars,,we wonder,,"What are stars?",That curiosity is what makes us human.,And that's what we do with science. 
 We like to say that gravitational wavesnnow have a purpose,,because we're opening upna new way to explore the universe.,Until now, we were able to seenthe light of the stars,via electromagnetic waves.,Now we can listennto the sound of the universe,,even of things that don't emit light,nlike gravitational waves. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 But are they useful?,Can't we derive any technologynfrom gravitational waves? 
 Yes, probably.,But it will probably take a lot of time.,We've developednthe technology to detect them,,but in terms of the waves themselves,,maybe we'll discover 100 years from nownthat they are useful.,But it takes a lot of timento derive technology from science,,and that's not why we do it.,All technology is derived from science,,but we practice science for the enjoyment.,What's left to do?,A lot.,A lot; this is only the beginning. 
 As we make the detectorsnmore and more sensitive --,and we have lots of work to do there --,not only are we going to seenmore black holes,and be able to catalognhow many there are, where they are,and how big they are,,we'll also be able to see other objects.,We'll see neutron stars fusenand turn into black holes.,We'll see a black holes being born.,We'll be able to seenrotating stars in our galaxy,produce sinusoidal waves.,We'll be able to seenexplosions of supernovas in our galaxy.,We'll be seeingna whole spectrum of new sources. 
 We like to say,that we've added a new sensento the human body:,now, in addition to seeing,,we're able to hear.,This is a revolution in astronomy,,like when Galileo invented the telescope.,It's like when they added soundnto silent movies.,This is just the beginning.,We like to think,that the road to science is very long --nvery fun, but very long --,and that we, this large,ninternational community of scientists,,working from many countries,ntogether as a team,,are helping to build that road;,that we're shedding light --nsometimes encountering detours --,and building, perhaps,,a highway to the universe. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)This story begins in 1985,,when at age 22,,I became the World Chess Champion,after beating Anatoly Karpov.,Earlier that year,,I played what is callednsimultaneous exhibition,against 32 of the world'snbest chess-playing machines,in Hamburg, Germany.,I won all the games,,and then it was not considerednmuch of a surprise,that I could beat 32 computersnat the same time.,To me, that was the golden age. 
 (Laughter) 
 Machines were weak,,and my hair was strong. 
 (Laughter) 
 Just 12 years later,,I was fighting for my lifenagainst just one computer,in a match,called by the cover of "Newsweek","The Brain's Last Stand.",No pressure. 
 (Laughter) 
 From mythology to science fiction,,human versus machine,has been often portrayednas a matter of life and death.,John Henry,,called the steel-driving man,in the 19th centurynAfrican American folk legend,,was pitted in a race,against a steam-powered hammer,bashing a tunnel through mountain rock.,John Henry's legendnis a part of a long historical narrative,pitting humanity versus technology.,And this competitive rhetoricnis standard now.,We are in a race against the machines,,in a fight or even in a war.,Jobs are being killed off.,People are being replacednas if they had vanished from the Earth.,It's enough to think that the moviesnlike "The Terminator" or "The Matrix",are nonfiction. 
 There are very few instances of an arena,where the human body and mindncan compete on equal terms,with a computer or a robot.,Actually, I wish there were a few more.,Instead,,it was my blessing and my curse,to literally become the proverbial man,in the man versus machine competition,that everybody is still talking about.,In the most famous human-machinencompetition since John Henry,,I played two matches,against the IBM supercomputer, Deep Blue.,Nobody remembersnthat I won the first match -- 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 In Philadelphia, before losing the rematchnthe following year in New York.,But I guess that's fair.,There is no day in history,nspecial calendar entry,for all the peoplenwho failed to climb Mt. Everest,before Sir Edmund Hillarynand Tenzing Norgay,made it to the top.,And in 1997, I was stillnthe world champion,when chess computers finally came of age.,I was Mt. Everest,,and Deep Blue reached the summit.,I should say of course,nnot that Deep Blue did it,,but its human creators --,Anantharaman, Campbell, Hoane, Hsu.,Hats off to them.,As always, machine's triumphnwas a human triumph,,something we tend to forget when humansnare surpassed by our own creations. 
 Deep Blue was victorious,,but was it intelligent?,No, no it wasn't,,at least not in the way Alan Turingnand other founders of computer science,had hoped.,It turned out that chessncould be crunched by brute force,,once hardware got fast enough,and algorithms got smart enough.,Although by the definition of the output,,grandmaster-level chess,,Deep Blue was intelligent.,But even at the incredible speed,,200 million positions per second,,Deep Blue's method,provided little of the dreamed-of insightninto the mysteries of human intelligence. 
 Soon,,machines will be taxi drivers,and doctors and professors,,but will they be "intelligent?",I would rather leave these definitions,to the philosophers and to the dictionary.,What really matters is how we humans,feel about living and workingnwith these machines. 
 When I first met Deep Bluenin 1996 in February,,I had been the world championnfor more than 10 years,,and I had played 182nworld championship games,and hundreds of games againstnother top players in other competitions.,I knew what to expect from my opponents,and what to expect from myself.,I was used to measure their moves,and to gauge their emotional state,by watching their body languagenand looking into their eyes. 
 And then I sat acrossnthe chessboard from Deep Blue.,I immediately sensed something new,,something unsettling.,You might experience a similar feeling,the first time you ridenin a driverless car,or the first time your new computernmanager issues an order at work.,But when I sat at that first game,,I couldn't be sure,what is this thing capable of.,Technology can advance in leaps,nand IBM had invested heavily.,I lost that game.,And I couldn't help wondering,,might it be invincible?,Was my beloved game of chess over?,These were human doubts, human fears,,and the only thing I knew for sure,was that my opponent Deep Bluenhad no such worries at all. 
 (Laughter) 
 I fought back,after this devastating blow,to win the first match,,but the writing was on the wall.,I eventually lost to the machine,but I didn't suffer the fate of John Henry,who won but diednwith his hammer in his hand.,It turned out that the world of chess,still wanted to havena human chess champion.,And even today,,when a free chess appnon the latest mobile phone,is stronger than Deep Blue,,people are still playing chess,,even more than ever before.,Doomsayers predictednthat nobody would touch the game,that could be conquered by the machine,,and they were wrong, proven wrong,,but doomsaying has always beenna popular pastime,when it comes to technology. 
 What I learned from my own experience,is that we must face our fears,if we want to get the mostnout of our technology,,and we must conquer those fears,if we want to get the bestnout of our humanity.,While licking my wounds,,I got a lot of inspiration,from my battles against Deep Blue.,As the old Russian saying goes,nif you can't beat them, join them.,Then I thought,,what if I could play with a computer --,together with a computer at my side,ncombining our strengths,,human intuitionnplus machine's calculation,,human strategy, machine tactics,,human experience, machine's memory.,Could it be the perfect game ever played? 
 My idea came to life,in 1998 under the name of Advanced Chess,when I played this human-plus-machinencompetition against another elite player.,But in this first experiment,,we both failed to combinenhuman and machine skills effectively.,Advanced Chess foundnits home on the internet,,and in 2005, a so-callednfreestyle chess tournament,produced a revelation.,A team of grandmastersnand top machines participated,,but the winners were not grandmasters,,not a supercomputer.,The winners were a pairnof amateur American chess players,operating three ordinary PCsnat the same time.,Their skill of coaching their machines,effectively counteractednthe superior chess knowledge,of their grandmaster opponents,and much greaterncomputational power of others.,And I reached this formulation.,A weak human player plus a machine,plus a better process is superior,to a very powerful machine alone,,but more remarkably,nis superior to a strong human player,plus machine,and an inferior process.,This convinced me that we would need,better interfacesnto help us coach our machines,towards more useful intelligence. 
 Human plus machine isn't the future,,it's the present.,Everybody that's used online translation,to get the gist of a news articlenfrom a foreign newspaper,,knowing its far from perfect.,Then we use our human experience,to make sense out of that,,and then the machinenlearns from our corrections.,This model is spreading and investingnin medical diagnosis, security analysis.,The machine crunches data,,calculates probabilities,,gets 80 percent of the way, 90 percent,,making it easier for analysis,and decision-making of the human party.,But you are not going to send your kids,to school in a self-driving carnwith 90 percent accuracy,,even with 99 percent.,So we need a leap forward,to add a few more crucial decimal places. 
 Twenty years afternmy match with Deep Blue,,second match,,this sensationaln"The Brain's Last Stand" headline,has become commonplace,as intelligent machines,move,in every sector, seemingly every day.,But unlike in the past,,when machines replaced,farm animals, manual labor,,now they are comingnafter people with college degrees,and political influence.,And as someonenwho fought machines and lost,,I am here to tell younthis is excellent, excellent news.,Eventually, every profession,will have to feel these pressures,or else it will mean humanitynhas ceased to make progress.,We don't,get to choose,when and wherentechnological progress stops.,We cannot,slow down.,In fact,,we have to speed up.,Our technology excels at removing,difficulties and uncertaintiesnfrom our lives,,and so we must seek out,ever more difficult,,ever more uncertain challenges.,Machines have,calculations.,We have understanding.,Machines have instructions.,We have purpose.,Machines have,objectivity.,We have passion.,We should not worrynabout what our machines can do today.,Instead, we should worrynabout what they still cannot do today,,because we will need the helpnof the new, intelligent machines,to turn our grandest dreams into reality.,And if we fail,,if we fail, it's not because our machinesnare too intelligent,,or not intelligent enough.,If we fail, it's becausenwe grew complacent,and limited our ambitions.,Our humanity is not defined by any skill,,like swinging a hammernor even playing chess. 
 There's one thing only a human can do.,That's dream.,So let us dream big. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Loneliness.,All of us in this roomnwill experience loneliness,at some point in our lives.,Loneliness is notna function of being alone,,but rather, a functionnof how socially connected you are,to those around you.,There could be somebodynin this room right now,surrounded by a thousand people,experiencing loneliness.,And while lonelinessncan be attributed to many things,,as an architect,,I'm going to tell you todaynhow loneliness can be the result,of our built environments --,the very homes we choose to live in. 
 Let's take a look at this house.,It's a nice house.,There's a big yard, picket fence,,two-car garage.,And the home might benin a neighborhood like this.,And for many people around the globe,,this home, this neighborhood --,it's a dream.,And yet the danger of achieving this dream,is a false sense of connection,and an increase in social isolation. 
 I know, I can hear you now,,there's somebody in the roomnscreaming at me inside their head,,"That's my house,nand that's my neighborhood,,and I know everyone on my block!",To which I would answer, "Terrific!",And I wish there werenmore people like you,,because I'd wager to guessnthere's more people in the room,living in a similar situation,that might not know their neighbors.,They might recognize them and say hello,,but under their breath,,they're asking their spouse,,"What was their name again?",so they can ask a question by namento signify they know them. 
 Social media also contributesnto this false sense of connection.,This image is probably all too familiar.,You're standing in the elevator,,sitting in a cafe,,and you look around,,and everyone's on their phone.,You're not texting or checking Facebook,,but everyone else is,,and maybe, like me,nyou've been in a situation,where you've made eye contact,,smiled and said hello,,and have that personnyank out their earbuds,and say, "I'm sorry, what did you say?",I find this incredibly isolating. 
 The concept I'd likento share with you today,is an antidote to isolation.,It's not a new concept.,In fact, it's an age-old way of living,,and it still exists in manynnon-European cultures,around the world.,And about 50 years ago,,the Danes decided to make up a new name,,and since then,,tens of thousands of Danish peoplenhave been living in this connected way.,And it's being pursuednmore widely around the globe,as people are seeking community.,This concept,is cohousing. 
 Cohousing is an intentional neighborhoodnwhere people know each other,and look after one another.,In cohousing, you have your own home,,but you also share significant spaces,nboth indoors and out.,Before I show younsome pictures of cohousing,,I'd like to first introduce younto my friends Sheila and Spencer.,When I first met Sheila and Spencer,nthey were just entering their 60s,,and Spencer was looking aheadnat the end of a long career,in elementary education.,And he really disliked the idea,that he might not havenchildren in his life,upon retirement.,They're now my neighbors.,We live in a cohousing communitynthat I not only designed,,but developed,and have my architecture practice in.,This community is very intentionalnabout our social interactions. 
 So let me take you on a tour.,From the outside, we look likenany other small apartment building.,In fact, we look identicalnto the one next door,,except that we're bright yellow.,Inside, the homes are fairly conventional.,We all have living rooms and kitchens,,bedrooms and baths,,and there are nine of these homesnaround a central courtyard.,This one's mine,,and this one is Spencer and Sheila's.,The thing that makes this buildingnuniquely cohousing,are not the homes,,but rather, what happens here --,the social interactions that happennin and around that central courtyard.,When I look across the courtyard,,I look forward to see Spencer and Sheila.,In fact, every morning,nthis is what I see,,Spencer waving at me furiouslynas we're making our breakfasts. 
 From our homes, we look downninto the courtyard,,and depending on the time of year,,we see this:,kids and grownups in various combinations,playing and hanging out with each other.,There's a lot of giggling and chatter.,There's a lot of hula-hooping.,And every now and then,n"Hey, quit hitting me!",or a cry from one of the kids.,These are the sounds of our daily lives,,and the sounds of social connectedness.,At the bottom of the courtyard,nthere are a set of double doors,,and those lead into the common house. 
 I consider the common housenthe secret sauce of cohousing.,It's the secret sauce,because it's the placenwhere the social interactions,and community life begin,,and from there, it radiates outnthrough the rest of the community.,Inside our common house,nwe have a large dining room,to seat all 28 of us and our guests,,and we dine together three times a week.,In support of those meals,nwe have a large kitchen,so that we can take turnsncooking for each other,in teams of three.,So that means, with 17 adults,,I lead cook once every six weeks.,Two other times, I show upnand help my team,with the preparation and cleanup.,And all those other nights,,I just show up.,I have dinner, talk with my neighbors,,and I go home, having been fedna delicious meal,by someone who caresnabout my vegetarian preferences. 
 Our nine familiesnhave intentionally chosen,an alternative way of living.,Instead of pursuing the American dream,,where we might have been isolatednin our single-family homes,,we instead chose cohousing,,so that we can increasenour social connections.,And that's how cohousing starts:,with a shared intention,to live collaboratively.,And intention is the single mostnimportant characteristic,that differentiates cohousingnfrom any other housing model.,And while intention is difficult to see,or even show,,I'm an architect, and I can't helpnbut show you more pictures. 
 So here are a few examples to illustrate,how intention has been expressed,in some of the communities I've visited.,Through the carefulnselection of furniture,,lighting and acoustic materialsnto support eating together;,in the careful visual locationnand visual access,to kids' play areas aroundnand inside the common house;,in the consideration of scale,and distribution of social gathering nodes,in and around the communitynto support our daily lives,,all of these spaces helpncontribute to and elevate,the sense of communitas,in each community. 
 What was that word? "Communitas.",Communitas is a fancy social science waynof saying "spirit of community.",And in visitingnover 80 different communities,,my measure of communitas became:,How frequently did residents eat together?,While it's completely up to each group,how frequently they have common meals,,I know some that have eaten togethernevery single night,for the past 40 years.,I know others,that have an occasional potlucknonce or twice a month.,And from my observations, I can tell you,,those that eat together more frequently,,exhibit higher levels of communitas.,It turns out, when you eat together,,you start planningnmore activities together.,When you eat together,nyou share more things.,You start to watch each other's kids.,You lend our your power tools.nYou borrow each other's cars. 
 And despite all this,,as my daughter loves to say,,everything is not rainbowsnand unicorns in cohousing,,and I'm not best friendsnwith every single person in my community.,We even have differences and conflicts.,But living in cohousing,nwe're intentional about our relationships.,We're motivatednto resolve our differences.,We follow up, we check in,,we speak our personal truths,and, when appropriate,,we apologize. 
 Skeptics will say that cohousingnis only interesting or attractive,to a very small group of people.,And I'll agree with that.,If you look at Western culturesnaround the globe,,those living in cohousingnare just a fractional percent.,But that needs to change,,because our very lives depend upon it. 
 In 2015, Brigham Young Universityncompleted a study,that showed a significantnincrease risk of premature death,in those who were living in isolation.,The US Surgeon Generalnhas declared isolation,to be a public health epidemic.,And this epidemicnis not restricted to the US alone. 
 So when I said earlier,that cohousingnis an antidote to isolation,,what I should have said,is that cohousing can save your life.,If I was a doctor, I would tell younto take two aspirin,,and call me in the morning.,But as an architect,,I'm going to suggestnthat you take a walk with your neighbor,,share a meal together,,and call me in 20 years. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm a neuroscientist,,and I'm the co-founder of Backyard Brains,,and our mission is to trainnthe next generation of neuroscientists,by taking graduate-levelnneuroscience research equipment,and making it available for kidsnin middle schools and high schools. 
 And so when we go into the classroom,,one way to get them thinkingnabout the brain, which is very complex,,is to ask them a very simplenquestion about neuroscience,,and that is, "What has a brain?",When we ask that,,students will instantly tell younthat their cat or dog has a brain,,and most will say that a mousenor even a small insect has a brain,,but almost nobody saysnthat a plant or a tree,or a shrub has a brain.,And so when you push --,because this could actuallynhelp describe a little bit,how the brain actually functions --,so you push and say,,"Well, what is it that makesnliving things have brains versus not?",And often they'll come backnwith the classification,that things that move tend to have brains.,And that's absolutely correct.,Our nervous system evolvednbecause it is electrical.,It's fast, so we can quickly respondnto stimuli in the world,and move if we need to.,But you can go backnand push back on a student,,and say, "Well, you know,nyou say that plants don't have brains,,but plants do move.",Anyone who has grown a plant,has noticed that the plant will move,and face the sun.,But they'll say,n"But that's a slow movement.,You know, that doesn't count.nThat could be a chemical process.",But what about fast-moving plants? 
 Now, in 1760, Arthur Dobbs,nthe Royal Governor of North Carolina,,made a pretty fascinating discovery.,In the swamps behind his house,,he found a plant that would spring shut,every time a bug would fall in between it.,He called this plant the flytrap,,and within a decade,nit made its way over to Europe,,where eventually the great Charles Darwinngot to study this plant,,and this plant absolutely blew him away.,He called it the most wonderfulnplant in the world.,This is a plantnthat was an evolutionary wonder.,This is a plant that moves quickly,,which is rare,,and it's carnivorous, which is also rare.,And this is in the same plant.,But I'm here today to tell you,that's not even the coolest thingnabout this plant.,The coolest thingnis that the plant can count. 
 So in order to show that,,we have to get some vocabularynout of the way.,So I'm going to do what we donin the classroom with students.,We're going to donan experiment on electrophysiology,,which is the recordingnof the body's electrical signal,,either coming from neuronsnor from muscles.,And I'm putting some electrodesnhere on my wrists.,As I hook them up,,we're going to be able to see a signal,on the screen here.,And this signal may be familiar to you.,It's called the EKG,nor the electrocardiogram.,And this is comingnfrom neurons in my heart,that are firingnwhat's called action potentials,,potential meaning voltage and actionnmeaning it moves quickly up and down,,which causes my heart to fire,,which then causesnthe signal that you see here.,And so I want you to remember the shapenof what we'll be looking at right here,,because this is going to be important.,This is a way that the brainnencodes information,in the form of an action potential. 
 So now let's turn to some plants.,So I'm going to firstnintroduce you to the mimosa,,not the drink, but the Mimosa pudica,,and this is a plant that's foundnin Central America and South America,,and it has behaviors.,And the first behaviornI'm going to show you,is if I touch the leaves here,,you get to see that the leavesntend to curl up.,And then the second behavior is,,if I tap the leaf,,the entire branch seems to fall down.,So why does it do that?,It's not really known to science.,One of the reasons whyncould be that it scares away insects,or it looks less appealing to herbivores.,But how does it do that?nNow, that's interesting.,We can do an experiment to find out. 
 So what we're going to do now,,just like I recordednthe electrical potential from my body,,we're going to record the electricalnpotential from this plant, this mimosa.,And so what we're going to donis I've got a wire wrapped around the stem,,and I've got the ground electrode where?,In the ground. It's an electricalnengineering joke. Alright. 
 (Laughter) 
 Alright. So I'm going to go aheadnand tap the leaf here,,and I want you to looknat the electrical recording,that we're going to see inside the plant.,Whoa. It is so big,nI've got to scale it down.,Alright. So what is that?,That is an action potentialnthat is happening inside the plant.,Why was it happening?,Because it wanted to move. Right?,And so when I hit the touch receptors,,it sent a voltage all the way downnto the end of the stem,,which caused it to move.,And now, in our arms,nwe would move our muscles,,but the plant doesn't have muscles.,What it has is water inside the cells,and when the voltage hits it,nit opens up, releases the water,,changes the shape of the cells,nand the leaf falls. 
 OK. So here we see an action potentialnencoding information to move. Alright?,But can it do more?,So let's go to find out.,We're going to go to our good friend,nthe Venus flytrap here,,and we're going to take a looknat what happens inside the leaf,when a fly lands on here.,So I'm going to pretendnto be a fly right now.,And now here's my Venus flytrap,,and inside the leaf,nyou're going to notice,that there are three little hairs here,nand those are trigger hairs.,And so when a fly lands --,I'm going to touchnone of the hairs right now.,Ready? One, two, three.,What do we get? We getna beautiful action potential.,However, the flytrap doesn't close.,And to understand why that is,,we need to know a little bit morenabout the behavior of the flytrap.,Number one is that it takesna long time to open the traps back up --,you know, about 24 to 48 hoursnif there's no fly inside of it.,And so it takes a lot of energy.,And two, it doesn't need to eatnthat many flies throughout the year.,Only a handful. It getsnmost of its energy from the sun.,It's just trying to replacensome nutrients in the ground with flies.,And the third thing is,,it only opens then closes the trapsna handful of times,until that trap dies.,So therefore, it wantsnto make really darn sure,that there's a meal inside of itnbefore the flytrap snaps shut.,So how does it do that?,It counts the number of seconds,between successiventouching of those hairs.,And so the idea isnthat there's a high probability,,if there's a fly inside of there,nthat it's going to be clicked together,,and so when it gets the firstnaction potential,,it starts counting, one, two,,and if it gets to 20nand it doesn't fire again,,then it's not going to close,,but if it does it within there,nthen the flytrap will close. 
 So we're going to go back now.,I'm going to touchnthe Venus flytrap again.,I've been talkingnfor more than 20 seconds.,So we can see what happensnwhen I touch the hair a second time.,So what do we get?nWe get a second action potential,,but again, the leaf doesn't close.,So now if I go back in there,and if I'm a fly moving around,,I'm going to be touchingnthe leaf a few times.,I'm going to go and brush it a few times.,And immediately,,the flytrap closes.,So here we are seeing the flytrapnactually doing a computation.,It's determiningnif there's a fly inside the trap,,and then it closes. 
 So let's go back to our original question.,Do plants have brains?,Well, the answer is no.,There's no brains in here.,There's no axons, no neurons.,It doesn't get depressed.,It doesn't want to knownwhat the Tigers' score is.,It doesn't havenself-actualization problems.,But what it does havenis something that's very similar to us,,which is the abilitynto communicate using electricity.,It just uses slightlyndifferent ions than we do,,but it's actually doing the same thing.,So just to show you,the ubiquitous naturenof these action potentials,,we saw it in the Venus flytrap,,we've seen an actionnpotential in the mimosa.,We've even seennan action potential in a human. 
 Now, this is the euro of the brain.,It's the way that allninformation is passed.,And so what we can donis we can use those action potentials,to pass information,between species of plants.,And so this is our interspeciesnplant-to-plant communicator,,and what we've donenis we've created a brand new experiment,where we're going to recordnthe action potential from a Venus flytrap,,and we're going to send itninto the sensitive mimosa. 
 So I want you to recall what happens,when we touch the leaves of the mimosa.,It has touch receptorsnthat are sending that information,back down in the formnof an action potential.,And so what would happen,if we took the action potentialnfrom the Venus flytrap,and sent it intonall the stems of the mimosa?,We should be able to createnthe behavior of the mimosas,without actually touching it ourselves. 
 And so if you'll allow me,,I'm going to go aheadnand trigger this mimosa right now,by touching on the hairsnof the Venus flytrap.,So we're going to send informationnabout touch from one plant to another. 
 So there you see it.,So -- 
 (Applause) 
 So I hope you learned a little bit,nsomething about plants today,,and not only that.,You learned that plants could be usednto help teach neuroscience,and bring along the neurorevolution. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Today I want to confess something to you,,but first of all I'm going to ask youna couple of questions.,How many people here have children?,And how many of you are confident,that you know hownto bring up your children,in exactly the right way? 
 (Laughter) 
 OK, I don't see too many handsngoing up on that second one,,and that's my confession, too.,I've got three boys;,they're three, nine and 12.,And like you, and like most parents,,the honest truth is I havenpretty much no idea what I'm doing.,I want them to benhappy and healthy in their lives,,but I don't know what I'm supposed to do,to make sure they are happy and healthy.,There's so many booksnoffering all kinds of conflicting advice,,it can be really overwhelming.,So I've spent most of their livesnjust making it up as I go along.,However, something changed mena few years ago,,when I came across a little secretnthat we have in Britain.,It's helped me become more confidentnabout how I bring up my own children,,and it's revealed a lot aboutnhow we as a society can help all children.,I want to share that secretnwith you today. 
 For the last 70 years,,scientists in Britain have been followingnthousands of children through their lives,as part of an incredible scientific study.,There's nothing quite like itnanywhere else in the world.,Collecting informationnon thousands of children,is a really powerful thing to do,,because it means we can comparenthe ones who say,,do well at school or end up healthynor happy or wealthy as adults,,and the ones who struggle much more,,and then we can sift throughnall the information we've collected,and try to work out whyntheir lives turned out different. 
 This British study --nit's actually a kind of crazy story.,So it all starts back in 1946,,just a few monthsnafter the end of the war,,when scientists wanted to know,what it was like for a womannto have a baby at the time.,They carried outnthis huge survey of mothers,and ended up recording the birthnof nearly every baby,born in England, Scotlandnand Wales in one week.,That was nearly 14,000 babies.,The questions they asked these women,are very different than the onesnwe might ask today.,They sound really old-fashioned now.,They asked them things like,,"During pregnancy,,did you get your full extra rationnof a pint of milk a day?","How much did you spendnon smocks, corsets,,nightdresses, knickers and brassieres?",And this is my favorite one:,"Who looked after your husbandnwhile you were in bed with this baby?" 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, this wartime studynactually ended up being so successful,that scientists did it again.,They recorded the birthsnof thousands of babies born in 1958,and thousands more in 1970.,They did it again in the early 1990s,,and again at the turn of the millennium.,Altogether, more than 70,000 childrennhave been involved in these studies,across those five generations.,They're called the British birth cohorts,,and scientists have gone backnand recorded more information,on all of these peoplenevery few years ever since.,The amount of informationnthat's now been collected on these people,is just completely mind-boggling.,It includes thousandsnof paper questionnaires,and terabytes' worth of computer data.,Scientists have also built upna huge bank of tissue samples,,which includes locks of hair,nnail clippings, baby teeth and DNA.,They've even collected 9,000 placentasnfrom some of the births,,which are now pickled in plastic bucketsnin a secure storage warehouse.,This whole project has become unique --,so, no other country in the worldnis tracking generations of children,in quite this detail.,These are some of the best-studiednpeople on the planet,,and the data has becomenincredibly valuable for scientists,,generating well over 6,000nacademic papers and books.,But today I want to focusnon just one finding --,perhaps the most important discoverynto come from this remarkable study.,And it's also the onenthat spoke to me personally,,because it's about how to use sciencento do the best for our children. 
 So, let's get the bad newsnout of the way first.,Perhaps the biggest messagenfrom this remarkable study is this:,don't be born into povertynor into disadvantage,,because if you are,,you're far more likelynto walk a difficult path in life.,Many children in this studynwere born into poor families,or into working-class families that hadncramped homes or other problems,,and it's clear nownthat those disadvantaged children,have been more likely to strugglenon almost every score.,They've been more likelynto do worse at school,,to end up with worse jobsnand to earn less money.,Now, maybe that sounds really obvious,,but some of the resultsnhave been really surprising,,so children who had a tough start in life,are also more likely to end upnunhealthy as adults.,They're more likely to be overweight,,to have high blood pressure,,and then decades down the line,,more likely to have a failing memory,npoor health and even to die earlier. 
 Now, I talked about what happens later,,but some of these differences emergenat a really shockingly early age.,In one study,,children who were growing up in poverty,were almost a year behindnthe richer children on educational tests,,and that was by the age of just three.,These types of differences have been foundnagain and again across the generations.,It means that our early circumstancesnhave a profound influence,on the way that the restnof our lives play out.,And working out why that is,is one of the most difficult questionsnthat we face today. 
 So there we have it.,The first lesson for successful life,neveryone, is this:,choose your parents very carefully. 
 (Laughter) 
 Don't be born into a poor familynor into a struggling family.,Now, I'm sure you can seenthe small problem here.,We can't choose our parentsnor how much they earn,,but this British study has also struckna real note of optimism,by showing that not everyonenwho has a disadvantaged start,ends up in difficult circumstances.,As you know, many peoplenhave a tough start in life,,but they end up doing very wellnon some measure nevertheless,,and this study starts to explain how. 
 So the second lesson is this:,parents really matter.,In this study,,children who had engaged,ninterested parents,,ones who had ambition for their future,,were more likely to escapenfrom a difficult start.,It seems that parents and what they donare really, really important,,especially in the first few years of life. 
 Let me give you an example of that.,In one study,,scientists looked at about 17,000 childrennwho were born in 1970.,They sifted all the mountains of datanthat they had collected,to try to work out,what allowed the childrennwho'd had a difficult start in life,to go on and do wellnat school nevertheless.,In other words, which ones beat the odds.,The data showed that what matterednmore than anything else was parents.,Having engaged, interested parentsnin those first few years of life,was strongly linked to children going onnto do well at school later on.,In fact, quite small thingsnthat parents do,are associated with goodnoutcomes for children.,Talking and listening to a child,,responding to them warmly,,teaching them their letters and numbers,,taking them on trips and visits.,Reading to children every daynseems to be really important, too.,So in one study,,children whose parents were readingnto them daily when they were five,and then showing an interestnin their education at the age of 10,,were significantly less likelynto be in poverty at the age of 30,than those whose parentsnweren't doing those things. 
 Now, there are huge challengesnwith interpreting this type of science.,These studies shownthat certain things that parents do,are correlated with goodnoutcomes for children,,but we don't necessarily knownthose behaviors caused the good outcomes,,or whether some other factornis getting in the way.,For example, we have to takengenes into account,,and that's a whole other talk in itself. 
 But scientists workingnwith this British study,are working really hard to get at causes,,and this is one study I particularly love.,In this one,,they looked at the bedtime routinesnof about 10,000 children,born at the turn of the millennium.,Were the children going to bednat regular times,,or did they go to bednat different times during the week?,The data showed that those childrennwho were going to bed at different times,were more likelynto have behavioral problems,,and then those that switchednto having regular bedtimes,often showed an improvement in behavior,,and that was really crucial,,because it suggestednit was the bedtime routines,that were really helping thingsnget better for those kids. 
 Here's another one to think about.,In this one,,scientists looked at childrennwho were reading for pleasure.,That means that they picked upna magazine, a picture book, a story book.,The data showed that childrennwho were reading for pleasure,at the ages of five and 10,were more likely to go on in schoolnbetter, on average,,on school tests later in their lives.,And not just tests of reading,,but tests of spelling and maths as well.,This study tried to controlnfor all the confounding factors,,so it looked at childrennwho were equally intelligent,and from the same social-class background,,so it seemed as if it was the readingnwhich really helped those children,go on and score better on thosenschool tests later in their lives. 
 Now at the start,,I said the first lesson from this study,was not to be born into povertynor into disadvantage,,because those children tend to follownmore difficult paths in their lives.,But then I said that parenting matters,,and that good parenting,nif you can call it that,,helps children beat the odds,and overcome somenof those early disadvantages.,So wait,,does that actually mean, then,nthat poverty doesn't matter after all?,You could argue it doesn't matternif a child is born poor --,as long as their parents are good parents,nthey're going to do just fine.,I don't believe that's true.,This study shows that povertynand parenting matter.,And one study actuallynput figures on that,,so it looked at childrenngrowing up in persistent poverty,and how well they were doing at school.,The data showed,that even when their parentsnwere doing everything right --,putting them to bed on time,and reading to them every daynand everything else --,that only got those children so far.,Good parenting only reducednthe educational gap,between the rich and poor childrennby about 50 percent.,Now that means that povertynleaves a really lasting scar,,and it means that if we really wantnto ensure the success and well-being,of the next generation,,then tackling child povertynis an incredibly important thing to do. 
 Now, what does all this meannfor you and me?,Are there lessons herenwe can all take home and use?,As a scientist and a journalist,,I like to have some sciencento inform my parenting ...,and I can tell you that whennyou're shouting at your kids,to go to bed on time,,it really helps to haventhe scientific literature on your side. 
 (Laughter) 
 And wouldn't it be great to think,that all we had to do to havenhappy, successful children,was to talk to them,nbe interested in their future,,put them to bed on time,nand give them a book to read?,Our job would be done. 
 Now, as you can imagine,,the answers aren't quitenas simple as that.,For one thing, this studynlooks at what happens,to thousands and thousandsnof children on average,,but that doesn't necessarily saynwhat will help my child or your child,or any individual child.,In the end, each of our childrennis going to walk their own path,,and that's partly definednby the genes they inherit,and of course all the experiencesnthey have through their lives,,including their interactionsnwith us, their parents. 
 I will tell you what I didnafter I learned all this.,It's a bit embarrassing.,I realized I was so busy working,,and ironically,,learning and writing about this incrediblenstudy of British children,,that there were days when I hardlyneven spoke to my own British children.,So at home, we introduced talking time,,which is just 15 minutesnat the end of the day,when we talk and listen to the boys.,I try better now to ask themnwhat they did today,,and to show that I valuenwhat they do at school.,Of course, I make surenthey always have a book to read.,I tell them I'm ambitiousnfor their future,,and I think they can be happynand do great things.,I don't know that any of thatnwill make a difference,,but I'm pretty confidentnit won't do them any harm,,and it might even do them some good. 
 Ultimately, if we want happy children,,all we can do is listen to the science,,and of course,,listen to our children themselves. 
 Thank you.The first time,I felt fear,I was 41 years old.,People have always said I was brave.,When I was little,nI'd climb the highest tree,,and I'd approach any animal fearlessly.,I liked challenges.,My father used to say,,"Good steel can withstandnany temperature." 
 And when I entered intonColombian politics,,I thought I'd be ablento withstand any temperature.,I wanted to end corruption;,I wanted to cut ties between politiciansnand drug traffickers.,The first time I was elected,,it was because I called out, by name,,corrupt and untouchable politicians.,I also called out the president,for his ties to the cartels. 
 That's when the threats started.,I had to send my very young childrennout of the country one morning,,hidden, all the way to the airport,nin the French ambassador's armored car.,Days later,,I was the victim of an attack,nbut emerged unharmed.,The following year,,the Colombian people elected menwith the highest number of votes.,I thought people applauded menbecause I was brave.,I, too, thought I was brave.,But I wasn't.,I had simply never before experienced,true fear. 
 That changed,on February 23, 2002.,At the time, I was a presidentialncandidate in Colombia,promoting my campaign agenda,,when I was detainednby a group of armed men.,They were wearing uniformsnwith military garments.,I looked at their boots; they were rubber.,And I knew,that the Colombian armynwore leather boots.,I knew that these were FARC guerrillas. 
 From that point on,neverything happened very quickly.,The commando leader ordered usnto stop the vehicle.,Meanwhile, one of his mennstepped on an antipersonnel mine,and flew through the air.,He landed, sitting upright,,right in front of me.,We made eye contact,and it was thennthat the young man understood:,his rubber boot with his leg still in it,had landed far away. 
 (Sighs) 
 He started,screaming like crazy.,And the truth is,,I felt -- as I feel right now,nbecause I'm reliving these emotions --,I felt at that momentnthat something inside of me was breaking,and that I was being infectednwith his fear.,My mind went blank and couldn't think;,it was paralyzed.,When I finally reacted,,I said to myself,,"They're going to kill me,,and I didn't say goodbye to my children.",As they took me intonthe deepest depths of the jungle,,the FARC soldiers announced,that if the government didn't negotiate,,they'd kill me.,And I knew,that the government wouldn't negotiate. 
 From that point on,,I went to sleep in fear every night --,cold sweats,,shaking,,stomach ache,,insomnia.,But worse than thatnwas what was happening to my mind,,because my memory was being erased:nall the phone numbers,,addresses,,names of very dear people,,even significant life events.,And so,,I began to doubt myself,nto doubt my mental health.,And with doubt came desperation,,and with desperation came depression.,I was suffering notoriousnbehavioral changes,and it wasn't just paranoianin moments of panic.,It was distrust,,it was hatred,,and it was also the urge to kill. 
 This, I realized,when they had menchained by the neck to a tree.,They kept me outside that day,,during a tropical downpour.,I remember feeling an urgent neednto use the bathroom.,"Whatever you have to do,,you'll do in front of me,,bitch,",the guard screamed at me.,And I,decided at that moment,to kill him.,And for days,,I was planning, trying to findnthe right moment, the right way to do it,,filled with hatred,,filled with fear.,Then suddenly,,I rose up,,snapped out of it,and thought:,"I'm not going to become one of them.,I'm not going to become an assassin.,I still have enough freedom,to decide,who I want to be." 
 That's when I learned that fear,brought me face to face with myself.,It forced me,to align my energies,,to align my meridians.,I learned that facing fear,could become a pathway to growth.,A lot of emotions arisenwhen I talk about all of this,,but when I think back,,I'm able to identify,the steps I took to do it.,I want to share three of them with you. 
 The first,was to be guided by principles.,Because I realized,that in the midst of panicnand mental block,,if I followed my principles,,I acted correctly. 
 I remember the first night,in a concentration campnthat the guerrillas had built,in the middle of the jungle,,with 12-foot-high bars,,barbed wire,,lookouts in the four corners,and armed men pointingnguns at us 24 hours a day.,That morning, the first morning,,some men arrived, yelling:,"Count off! Count off!",My fellow hostages woke up, startled,,and began to identify themselvesnin numbered sequence.,But when it was my turn,,I said,,"Ingrid Betancourt.,If you want to know if I'm here,ncall me by my name." 
 The guards' fury,was nothing comparednto that of the other hostages,,because, obviously they were scared --,we were all scared --,and they were afraid that, because of me,nthey would be punished.,But for me,,beyond fear was the neednto defend my identity,,to not let them turn me intona thing or a number.,That was one of the principles:,to defend,what I considered to be human dignity. 
 But make no mistake:,the guerrillas had it all,very well analyzed --,they had been kidnapping for years,,and they had developed a technique,to break us,,to defeat us, to divide us.,And so,,the second step,was to learn how to buildnsupportive trust,,to learn how to unite. 
 The jungle is like a different planet.,It's a world,of shadows, of rain,,with the hum of millions of bugs --,majiña ants, bullet ants.,I didn't stop scratching a single daynwhile I was in the jungle.,And of course, there were tarantulas,nscorpions, anacondas ...,I once came face to facenwith a 24-foot long anaconda,that could have swallowed me in one bite.,Jaguars ... 
 But I want to tell you,that none of these animalsndid us as much harm,as the human beings.,The guerrillas terrorized us.,They spread rumors.,Among the hostages,nthey sparked betrayals,,jealousy,,resentment,,mistrust. 
 The first time I escapednfor a long time was with Lucho.,Lucho had been a hostagenfor two years longer than I had.,We decided to tie ourselves up,with ropes,to have the strengthnto lower ourselves into that dark water,full of piranhas and alligators.,What we did was, during the day,nwe would hide in the mangroves.,And at night,,we would leave, get in the water,,and we would swimnand let the current carry us.,That went on for several days.,But Lucho,became sick.,He was diabetic,,and he fell into a diabetic coma.,So the guerrillas captured us. 
 But after having livednthrough that with Lucho,,after having faced fear together, united,,not punishment, not violence -- nothing --,could ever again divide us.,What's certain is,,all the guerrillas' manipulationnwas so damaging to us,that even today,,among some of the hostages,from back then,,tensions linger,,passed down from all that poison,that the guerrillas created. 
 The third step,is very important to me,,and it's a giftnthat I want to give to you.,The third step is to learnnhow to develop faith.,I want to explain it like this:,Jhon Frank Pinchao,was a police officer,who had been a hostagenfor more than eight years.,He was famous for beingnthe biggest scaredy-cat of us all.,But Pincho -- I called him "Pincho" --,Pincho decided that he wanted to escape.,And he asked me to help him.,By that point, I basically hadna master's degree in escape attempts. 
 (Laughter) 
 So,we got started but we had a delay,,because first, Pinchonhad to learn how to swim.,And we had to carry outnall these preparations in total secrecy.,Anyway, when we finallynhad everything ready,,Pincho came up to menone afternoon and said, 
 "Ingrid, suppose I'm in the jungle,,and I go around and around in circles,nand I can't find the way out.,What do I do?" 
 "Pincho,,you grab a phone,,and you call the man upstairs." 
 "Ingrid, you know I don't believe in God.","God doesn't care. He'll still help you." 
 (Applause) 
 It rained all night that night.,The following morning,,the camp woke up to a big commotion,,because Pincho had fled.,They made us dismantle the camp,nand we started marching.,During the march,,the head guerrillas told usnthat Pincho had died,,and that they had found his remains,eaten by an anaconda.,Seventeen days passed --,and believe me, I counted them,nbecause they were torture for me.,But on the seventeenth day,,the news exploded from the radio:,Pincho was free and obviously alive.,And this was the first thing he said: 
 "I know my fellow hostages are listening.,Ingrid,,I did what you told me.,I called the man upstairs,,and he sent me the patrolnthat rescued me from the jungle." 
 That was an extraordinary moment,,because ...,obviously fear is contagious.,But faith is, too.,Faith isn't rational or emotional.,Faith,is an exercise of the will.,It's the discipline of the will.,It's what allows us to transformneverything that we are --,our weaknesses, our frailties,,into strength, into power.,It's truly a transformation.,It's what gives us the strength,to stand up,in the face of fear,look above it,,and see beyond it.,I hope you remember that,,because I know we all need,to connect with that strengthnwe have inside of us,for the times when there's a stormnraging around our boat. 
 Many, many, many, many years passed,before I could return to my house.,But when they took us, handcuffed,ninto the helicopter,that finally took us out of the jungle,,everything happened as quicklynas when they kidnapped me.,In an instant,,I saw the guerrilla commander at my feet,,gagged,,and the rescue leader,,yelling: 
 "We're the Colombian army!,You are free!" 
 The shriek,that came out of all of us,when we regained our freedom,,continues to vibrate in me to this day. 
 Now,,I know they can divide all of us,,they can manipulate us all with fear.,The "No" vote on the peacenreferendum in Colombia;,Brexit;,the idea of a wallnbetween Mexico and the United States;,Islamic terrorism --,they're all examplesnof using fear politically,to divide and recruit us.,We all feel fear.,But we can all avoid being recruited,using the resources we have --nour principles, unity, faith.,Yes, fear is part of the human condition,,as well as being necessary for survival.,But above all,,it's the guide by which each of us builds,our identity, our personality. 
 It's true, I was 41 years oldnthe first time I felt fear,,and feeling fear was not my decision.,But it was my decisionnwhat to do with that fear.,You can survive,crawling along, fearful.,But you can also,rise above the fear,,rise up, spread your wings,,and soar, fly high, high, high, high,nuntil you reach the stars,,where all of us want to go. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Hi everyone.,So, I'm going to take us back to 2007.,I'd just spent about six monthsnworking on album,that I'd poured my heart and my soul into,,and it was getting about three playsnper day on Myspace at the time,,and I was getting more and more depressednwhen I started noticing these other people,who were playing guitar and singing,and putting videosnon this new site called YouTube,,and they were getting 300,000 views.,So I decided I'm going to startnmaking some Youtube videos.,And one day they featuredna video of my band on the homepage,,which was amazing --nwe got a bunch of new fans.,We also got a bunch of people,who, I guess, just didn't really likenthe music or something -- 
 (Laughter) 
 It's OK because peoplenstarted coming to our shows,,and we started touring,,and we came out with a record.,And when I checkednour bank account balance,after our first monthly iTunes payout,,we had 22,000 bucks in it,,which was amazing because at the timenI was living at my dad's house,,trying to make a living as a musiciannby uploading videos to the internet,which literally zero peoplenrespected in 2009 --,even the people who werenuploading videos to the internet. 
 And so for the next four years,,I uploaded more and morenvideos to the Internet,,and they got better and better,,and we made enough moneynthrough brand deals,and commercials and iTunes sales,to buy a house.,And we built a recording studio.,But there was one big problem:,making money as a creative personnin 2013 was super weird.,First of all, the business modelsnwere changing all the time.,So our 58,000 dollarsnof annual iTunes download income,was about to be replaced by aboutn6,000 dollars of streaming income.,Steams paid less than downloads.,And then as more and more creatorsnstarted popping up online,,there was just more competitionnfor these five-figure brand deals,that had kept the band afloat for years.,And to top it all off,nour videos themselves --,the creative stuff that we madenthat our fans loved and appreciated --,that were actuallyncontributing value to the world,,those videos were generatingnalmost zero dollars of income for us.,This is an actual snapshotnof my YouTube dashboard,from a 28-day period,that shows one million views,and 166 dollars of ad earningsnfor those views. 
 The whole machine in 2013,that took art online and outputted money,was totally nonfunctional.,It doesn't matter if you're a newspaper,,or an institution,,or an independent creator.,A monthly web comicnwith 20,000 monthly readers --,20,000 monthly readers --,gets paid a couple hundrednbucks in ad revenue.,This is 20,000 people.,Like, in what world is this not enough?,I don't understand.,What systems have we builtnwhere this is insufficient,for a person to make a living? 
 So, I actually have a theory about this.,I think it's been a weird 100 years. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 About 100 years ago,,humans figured out how to recordnsound onto a wax cylinder.,That was the beginning of the phonograph.,Right around the same time,,we figured out how to recordnlight onto a piece of photographic paper,,celluloid -- the beginningnof film and television.,For the first time,nyou could store art on a thing,,which was amazing.,Art used to be completely ephemeral,,so if you missed the symphony,nyou just didn't get to hear the orchestra.,But now, for the first time,,you could store the orchestra'snperformance on a physical object,,and like, listen to it later,,which was amazing.,It was so amazing in fact,,that for the next 100 years,nbetween 1900 and 2000,,humans built just billions and billionsnof dollars of infrastructure,to essentially help artists do two things.,First, put their art on a thing,,and second, get that thingnaround the world,to the people who wanted the art.,So, so much industrynis devoted to these two problems.,Oh my gosh, there are trucking companies,,and brick-and-mortar and marketing firms,nand CD jewel case manufacturers,,all devoted to these two problems. 
 And then we all know what happened.,10 years ago, the internet matures,and we get Spotifynand Facebook and YouTube,and iTunes and Google search,,and a hundred years of infrastructure,and supply chains and distribution systems,and monetization schemes,are completely bypassed --,in a decade.,After 100 years of designing these things,,it's no wonder that it's just totallynbroken for creative people right now.,It's no wonder that the monetizationnpart of the chain doesn't work,given this new context. 
 But what gets me super excitednto be a creator right now,,to be alive today and bena creative person right now,,is realizing that we're only 10 yearsninto figuring out this new machine --,to figuring out the next 100 yearsnof infrastructure for our creators.,And you can tell we're only 10 years in.,There's a lot of trial and error,nsome really good ideas forming,,a lot of experimentation.,We're figuring outnwhat works and what doesn't.,Like Twitch streamers.nWho's heard of Twitch?,Twitch streamers are makingnthree to five thousand bucks a month,streaming gaming content.,The big ones are makingnover 100,000 dollars a year.,There's a site called YouNow,,it's an app.,It allows musicians and vloggersnto get paid in digital goods from fans. 
 So, I'm also working on the problem.,Four years ago I startedna company called Patreon,with a friend of mine.,We're 80 people nownworking on this problem.,It's basically a membership platform,that makes it really easynfor creators to get paid --,every month from their fansnto earn a living.,For a creator, it's like having a salarynfor being a creative person.,And this is one of our creators.,They're called "Kinda Funny.",They have about 220,000nsubscribers on YouTube.,And when they upload a video,,it gets somewhere aroundn15,000 views to 100,000 views.,I want you to check yourselves right now.,I think when we hear numbers like that,nwhen we hear "15,000 views,",and we see content like this,,we just snap categorize itnas being not as legitimate,as a morning shownthat you'd hear on the radio,or a talk show that you'dnsee on NBC or something,But when "Kinda Funny"nlaunched on Patreon,,within a few weeks, they werenmaking 31,000 dollars per month,for this show.,It took off so fast that they decidednto expand their programming,and add new shows,,and now they launchedna second Patreon page --,they're making an additionaln21,000 dollars per month.,And they're scaling what's essentiallynbecoming a media company,,financing the whole thingnthrough membership. 
 OK, here's another example.,This is Derek Bodner,,a sports journalist who usednto write for Philadelphia Magazine,until a few months ago whennthe magazine cut out all sports coverage.,Now he writes articlesnand publishes them on his own website --,he's still covering sports,nbut for himself.,And he's making 4,800 bucksna month from 1,700 patrons,,financing it through membership. 
 This is Crash Course --,free educational content for the world.,This show is actuallynon the PBS digital network --,29,000 dollars per month.,This is a duo sailing around the world,,getting paid every monthnfor documenting their travels,from 1,400 patrons.,This is a podcast,n"Chapo Trap House", making --,actually, since I screenshotted this,,they're making an additionaln2,000 dollars per month,,so they're now making 56,000 dollarsnper month for their podcast. 
 And Patreon's not the only onenworking on the problem.,Even Google's starting to work on this.,A couple years ago,nthey launched Fan Funding;,more recently, they launched Super Chat,as a way for creatorsnto monetize live streaming.,Newspapers are startingnto experiment with membership.,New York Times has a membership program;,The Guardian has over 200,000npaying subscribers,to its membership program.,There's this bubbling soupnof ideas and experiments,and progress right now,,and it's pointing in the directionnof getting creators paid.,And it's working.,It's not, like, perfect yet,,but it's really working. 
 So, Patreon has over 50,000 creatorsnon the platform making salaries --,getting paid every monthnfor putting art online,,for being a creative person.,The next hundred yearsnof infrastructure is on the way,and it's going to be differentnthis time because of this --,because of the direct connectionnbetween the person who makes the thing,and the person who likes the thing. 
 About seven or eight years ago,,I went to a cocktail party.,This is when the bandnhad hit our first machine,,so things were really cranking.,We had just madenabout 400,000 dollars in one year,through iTunes salesnand brand deals and stuff like that.,And this guy comes up to me and says,,"Hey, Jack, what do you do?",I said, "I'm a musician.",And he just sobered up immediately,,and he stuck out his hand,,put a hand on my shoulder,,and in a real earnest,nvery nice voice he was like,,"I hope you make it someday." 
 (Laughter) 
 And ...,I have so many moments like thatnlogged in my memory.,I just cringe thinking of that.,It's so embarrassing to justnnot feel valued as a creative person.,But as a species,,we are leaving that cocktail party behind.,We're leaving that culture,,we're out of there.,We're going to get so goodnat paying creators,,within 10 years,,kids graduating high school and collegenare going to think of being a creator,as just being an option --,I could be a doctor, I could be a lawyer,,I could be a podcaster,nI could have a web comic.,It's just going to bensomething you can do.,We're figuring it out.,It's going to be a viable and sustainablenand respected profession.,Creators are going to come outnthe other end of this weird 100 years,,this century-long journey,,with an awesome new machine.,And they're going to be paid,nand they're going to be valued.,Thanks, everybody. 
 (Applause) 
 I think it went pretty well.,I want artists who saw thatnto not give up --,to know that we're getting there.,It's not there yet,,but in a couple years,,there will be so many systemsnand tools for them,to just make a living online,,and if they've got a podcastnthat's starting to take off,,but they're not ablento make money on it yet,,that's happening,and they're going to be paid.,It's happening.I just want to share with you,what I have been experiencingnover the last five years,in having the great privilege of traveling,to many of the poorestncountries in the world. 
 This scene is onenI see all the time everywhere,,and these young childrennare looking at a smartphone,,and the smartphone is having a huge impactnin even the poorest countries.,I said to my team, you know,,what I see is a rise in aspirationsnall over the world.,In fact, it seems to menthat there's a convergence of aspirations.,And I asked a team of economistsnto actually look into this.,Is this true?,Are aspirations convergingnall around the world?,So they looked at things like Gallup pollsnabout satisfaction in life,and what they learned wasnthat if you have access to the internet,,your satisfaction goes up.,But another thing happensnthat's very important:,your reference income,,the income to which you compare your own,,also goes up.,Now, if the reference incomenof a nation, for example,,goes up 10 percent,by comparing themselves to the outside,,then on average,,people's own incomesnhave to go up at least five percent,to maintain the samenlevel of satisfaction.,But when you get downninto the lower percentiles of income,,your income has to go up much more,if the reference incomengoes up 10 percent,,something like 20 percent.,And so with this rise of aspirations,,the fundamental question is:,Are we going to have a situation,where aspirationsnare linked to opportunity,and you get dynamism and economic growth,,like that which happenednin the country I was born in, in Korea?,Or are aspirationsngoing to meet frustration? 
 This is a real concern,nbecause between 2012 and 2015,,terrorism incidentsnincreased by 74 percent.,The number of deaths from terrorismnwent up 150 percent.,Right now, two billion people,live in conditionsnof fragility, conflict, violence,,and by 2030, more than 60 percentnof the world's poor,will live in these situationsnof fragility, conflict and violence.,And so what do we donabout meeting these aspirations?,Are there new ways of thinking,about how we can risento meet these aspirations?,Because if we don't,nI'm extremely worried.,Aspirations are rising as never beforenbecause of access to the internet.,Everyone knows how everyone else lives.,Has our ability to meet those aspirations,risen as well? 
 And just to get at the details of this,,I want to share with younmy own personal story.,This is not my mother,,but during the Korean War,,my mother literally took her own sister,,her younger sister, on her back,,and walked at least part of the way,to escape Seoul during the Korean War.,Now, through a series of miracles,,my mother and father both gotnscholarships to go to New York City.,They actually met in New York Citynand got married in New York City.,My father, too, was a refugee.,At the age of 19, he left his familynin the northern part of the country,,escaped through the border,and never saw his family again.,Now, when they were marriednand living in New York,,my father was a waiternat Patricia Murphy's restaurant.,Their aspirations went up.,They understood what it was likento live in a place like New York City,in the 1950s. 
 Well, my brother was bornnand they came back to Korea,,and we had what I remembernas kind of an idyllic life,,but what was happeningnin Korea at that time,was the country was onenof the poorest in the world,and there was political upheaval.,There were demonstrations just downnthe street from our house all the time,,students protestingnagainst the military government.,And at the time,,the aspirations of the World Bank Group,nthe organization I lead now,,were extremely low for Korea.,Their idea was that Korea wouldnfind it difficult without foreign aid,to provide its people with morenthan the bare necessities of life.,So the situation isnKorea is in a tough position,,my parents have seennwhat life is like in the United States.,They got married there.nMy brother was born there.,And they felt that in ordernto give us an opportunity,to reach their aspirations for us,,we had to go and come backnto the United States. 
 Now, we came back.,First we went to Dallas.,My father did his dental degreenall over again.,And then we ended upnmoving to Iowa, of all places.,We grew up in Iowa.,And in Iowa, we wentnthrough the whole course.,I went to high school, I went to college.,And then one day,nsomething that I'll never forget,,my father picked me upnafter my sophomore year in college,,and he was driving me home,,and he said, "Jim,nwhat are your aspirations?,What do you want to study?nWhat do you want to do?",And I said, "Dad," --,My mother actually was a philosopher,nand had filled us with ideas,about protest and social justice,,and I said, "Dad, I'm going to studynpolitical science and philosophy,,and I'm going to becomenpart of a political movement.",My father, the Korean dentist,,slowly pulled the carnover to the side of the road -- 
 (Laughter) 
 He looked back at me, and he said,,"Jim, you finish your medical residency,nyou can study anything you want." 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, I've told this storynto a mostly Asian audience before.,Nobody laughs. They just shake their head.,Of course. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 So, tragically,nmy father died at a young age,,30 years ago at the age of 57,,what happens to be how old I am right now,,and when he died in the middlenof my medical and graduate studies --,You see, I actually got around itnby doing medicine and anthropology.,I studied both of them in graduate school. 
 But then right about that time,nI met these two people,,Ophelia Dahl and Paul Farmer.,And Paul and I were in the same program.,We were studying medicine,and at the same timengetting our PhD's in anthropology.,And we began to asknsome pretty fundamental questions.,For people who have the great privilegenof studying medicine and anthropology --,I had come from parents who were refugees.,Paul grew up literallynin a bus in a swamp in Florida.,He liked to call himself "white trash.",And so we had this opportunity,and we said,,what is it that we need to do?,Given our ridiculouslynelaborate educations,,what is the naturenof our responsibility to the world?,And we decided that we needednto start an organization.,It's called Partners in Health.,And by the way,nthere's a movie made about that. 
 (Applause) 
 There's a movienthat was just a brilliant movie,they made about itncalled "Bending the Arc.",It launched at Sundance this past January.,Jeff Skoll is here.,Jeff is one of the onesnwho made it happen.,And we began to thinknabout what it would take for us,to actually have our aspirationsnreach the level,of some of the poorestncommunities in the world. 
 This is my very first visitnto Haiti in 1988,,and in 1988, we elaboratedna sort of mission statement,,which is we are going to makena preferential option for the poor,in health.,Now, it took us a long time, and wenwere graduate students in anthropology.,We were reading up one side of Marxnand down the other.,Habermas. Fernand Braudel.,We were reading everything,and we had to come to a conclusionnof how are we going to structure our work?,So "O for the P," we called it,,a preferential option for the poor. 
 The most important thingnabout a preferential option for the poor,is what it's not.,It's not a preferential optionnfor your own sense of heroism.,It's not a preferential option,for your own idea aboutnhow to lift the poor out of poverty.,It's not a preferential optionnfor your own organization.,And the hardest of all,,it's not a preferential optionnfor your poor.,It's a preferential option for the poor. 
 So what do you do?,Well, Haiti, we started building --,Everyone told us, the cost-effective thing,is just focus on vaccinationnand maybe a feeding program.,But what the Haitians wantednwas a hospital.,They wanted schools.,They wanted to provide their childrennwith the opportunities,that they'd been hearing aboutnfrom others, relatives, for example,,who had gone to the United States.,They wanted the same kindsnof opportunities as my parents did.,I recognized them.,And so that's what we did.nWe built hospitals.,We provided education.,And we did everything we couldnto try to give them opportunities. 
 Now, my experience really became intense,at Partners in Healthnin this community, Carabayllo,,in the northern slums of Lima, Peru.,And in this community,,we started out by really just goingnto people's homes and talking to people,,and we discovered an outbreak, an epidemicnof multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.,This is Melquiades.,Melquiades was a patient at that time,nhe was about 18 years old,,and he had a very difficult formnof drug-resistant tuberculosis.,All of the gurus in the world,nthe global health gurus,,said it is not cost-effectivento treat drug-resistant tuberculosis.,It's too complicated. It's too expensive.,You just can't do it. It can't be done.,And in addition,nthey were getting angry at us,,because the implication was,if it could be done,nwe would have done it.,Who do you think you are?,And the people that we fought withnwere the World Health Organization,and probably the organizationnwe fought with most,was the World Bank Group. 
 Now, we did everything we could,to convince Melquiadesnto take his medicines,,because it's really hard,,and not once during the time of treatmentndid Melquiades's family ever say,,"Hey, you know, Melquiadesnis just not cost-effective.,Why don't you go onnand treat somebody else?" 
 (Laughter) 
 I hadn't seen Melquiadesnfor about 10 years,and when we hadnour annual meetings in Lima, Peru,a couple of years ago,,the filmmakers found him,and here is us getting together. 
 (Applause) 
 He has become a bit of a media starnbecause he goes to the film openings,,and he knows how to work an audience now. 
 (Laughter) 
 But as soon as we won --,We did win. We won the argument.,You should treatnmultidrug-resistant tuberculosis --,we heard the same argumentsnin the early 2000s about HIV.,All of the leading global healthnpeople in the world said,it is impossiblento treat HIV in poor countries.,Too expensive, too complicated,nyou can't do it.,Compared to drug-resistant TB treatment,,it's actually easier.,And we were seeing patients like this.,Joseph Jeune.,Joseph Jeune also never mentionednthat he was not cost-effective.,A few months of medicines,nand this is what he looked like. 
 (Applause) 
 We call that the Lazarus Effectnof HIV treatment.,Joseline came to us looking like this.,This is what she looked likena few months later. 
 (Applause) 
 Now, our argument, our battle, we thought,,was with the organizationsnthat kept saying it's not cost-effective.,We were saying, no,,preferential option for the poornrequires us to raise our aspirations,to meet those of the poor for themselves.,And they said, well, that's a nice thoughtnbut it's just not cost-effective.,So in the nerdy waynthat we have operated Partners in Health,,we wrote a book against,nbasically, the World Bank.,It says that because the World Bank,has focused so muchnon just economic growth,and said that governmentsnhave to shrink their budgets,and reduce expendituresnin health, education and social welfare --,we thought that was fundamentally wrong.,And we argued with the World Bank.,And then a crazy thing happened.,President Obama nominated mento be President of the World Bank. 
 (Applause) 
 Now, when I went to do the vetting processnwith President Obama's team,,they had a copy of "Dying For Growth,"nand they had read every page.,And I said, "OK, that's it, right?,You guys are going to drop me?",He goes, "Oh, no, no, it's OK.",And I was nominated,,and I walked through the doornof the World Bank Group in July of 2012,,and that statement on the wall,n"Our dream is a world free of poverty.",A few months after that,nwe actually turned it into a goal:,end extreme poverty by 2030,,boost shared prosperity.,That's what we do nownat the World Bank Group.,I feel like I have broughtnthe preferential option for the poor,to the World Bank Group. 
 (Applause) 
 But this is TED,,and so I want to sharenwith you some concerns,,and then make a proposal. 
 The Fourth Industrial Revolution,,now, you guys knownso much better than I do,,but here's the thing that concerns me.,What we hear about is job loss.nYou've all heard that.,Our own data suggest to usnthat two thirds of all jobs,,currently existing jobsnin developing countries,,will be lost because of automation.,Now, you've got to make up for those jobs.,Now, one of the waysnto make up for those jobs,is to turn community health workersninto a formal labor force.,That's what we want to do. 
 (Applause) 
 We think the numbers will work out,,that as health outcomes get betternand as people have formal work,,we're going to be able to train them,with the soft-skills trainingnthat you add to it,to become workersnthat will have a huge impact,,and that may be the one areanthat grows the most. 
 But here's the other thingnthat bothers me:,right now it seems pretty clear to menthat the jobs of the future,will be more digitally demanding,,and there is a crisisnin childhood stunting.,So these are photos from Charles Nelson,nwho shared these with us,from Harvard Medical School.,And what these photos shownon the one side, on the left side,,is a three-month-old who has been stunted:,not adequate nutrition,nnot adequate stimulation.,And on the other side,nof course, is a normal child,,and the normal childnhas all of these neuronal connections.,Now, the neuronal connectionsnare important,,because that isnthe definition of human capital.,Now, we know that wencan reduce these rates.,We can reduce these ratesnof childhood stunting quickly,,but if we don't, India, for example,nwith 38 percent childhood stunting,,how are they going to competenin the economy of the future,if 40 percent of their future workersncannot achieve educationally,and certainly we worrynabout achieving economically,in a way that will helpnthe country as a whole grow. 
 Now, what are we going to do?,78 trillion dollarsnis the size of the global economy.,8.55 trillion dollars are sittingnin negative interest rate bonds.,That means that you giventhe German central bank your money,and then you pay them to keep your money.,That's a negative interest rate bond.,24.4 trillion dollarsnin very low-earning government bonds.,And 8 trillion literally sittingnin the hands of rich people,under their very large mattresses.,What we are trying to donis now use our own tools --,and just to get nerdy for a second,,we're talking aboutnfirst-loss risk debt instruments,,we're talking about derisking,nblended finance,,we're talking aboutnpolitical risk insurance,,credit enhancement --,all these things that I've now learnednat the World Bank Group,that rich people use every single daynto make themselves richer,,but we haven't used aggressively enoughnon behalf of the poor,to bring this capital in. 
 (Applause) 
 So does this work?,Can you actually bringnprivate-sector players into a country,and really make things work?,Well, we've done it a couple of times.,This is Zambia, Scaling Solar.,It's a box-set solutionnfrom the World Bank,where we come innand we do all the things you need,to attract private-sector investors.,And in this case, Zambia wentnfrom having a cost of electricity,at 25 cents a kilowatt-hour,,and by just doing simple things,ndoing the auction,,changing some policies,,we were able to bring the cost down.,Lowest bid,,25 cents a kilowatt-hour for Zambia?,The lowest bid was 4.7 centsna kilowatt-hour. It's possible. 
 (Applause) 
 But here's my proposal for you.,This is from a group called Zipline,,a cool company, and theynliterally are rocket scientists.,They figured outnhow to use drones in Rwanda.,This is me launching a drone in Rwanda,that delivers bloodnanywhere in the country,in less than an hour.,So we save lives,,this program saved lives -- 
 (Applause) 
 This program made money for Zipline,and this program savednhuge amounts of money for Rwanda.,That's what we need,nand we need that from all of you.,I'm asking you, carve outna little bit of time in your brains,to think about the technologynthat you work on,,the companies that you start,nthe design that you do.,Think a little bit and work with us,to see if we can come up with these kindsnof extraordinary win-win solutions. 
 I'm going to leave younwith one final story.,I was in Tanzania,nand I was in a classroom.,This is me with a classroomnof 11-year-olds.,And I asked them, as I always do,,"What do you want to be when you grow up?",Two raised their hands and said,,"I want to be Presidentnof the World Bank." 
 (Laughter) 
 And just like you, my own teamnand their teachers laughed.,But then I stopped them.,I said, "Look, I want to tell you a story.,When I was born in South Korea,nthis is what it looked like.,This is where I came from.,And when I was three years old,,in preschool,,I don't think that George David Woods,nthe President of the World Bank,,if he had visited Korea on that daynand come to my classroom,,that he would have thought,that the future Presidentnof the World Bank,was sitting in that classroom.,Don't let anyone ever tell you,that you cannot benPresident of the World Bank." 
 Now -- thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Let me leave you with one thought.,I came from a countrynthat was the poorest in the world.,I'm President of the World Bank.,I cannot and I will notnpull up the ladder behind me.,This is urgent.,Aspirations are going up.,Everywhere aspirations are going up.,You folks in this room, work with us.,We know that we can findnthose Zipline-type solutions,and help the poornleapfrog into a better world,,but it won't happennuntil we work together.,The future "you" --nand especially for your children --,the future you,will depend on how much carenand compassion we bring,to ensuring that the future "us"nprovides equality of opportunity,for every child in the world. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: You'd almost think,people are surprisednto hear a talk like this,from the President of the World Bank.,It's kind of cool.,I'd encourage you to even bena little more specific on your proposal.,There's many investors,nentrepreneurs in this room.,How will you partner with them?nWhat's your proposal? 
 Jim Yong Kim: Can I get nerdynfor just a second. 
 CA: Get nerdy. Absolutely.nJYK: So here's what we did.,Insurance companies never investnin developing country infrastructure,,for example, becausenthey can't take the risk.,They're holding moneynfor people who pay for insurance.,So what we did was a SwedishnInternational Development Association,gave us a little bit of money,,we went out and raised a little bitnmore money, a hundred million,,and we took first loss,nmeaning if this thing goes bad,,10 percent of the loss we'll just eat,,and the rest of you will be safe.,And that createdna 90-percent chunk, tranche,that was triple B, investment-grade,nso the insurance companies invested.,So for us, what we're doingnis taking our public money,and using it to derisknspecific instruments,to bring people in from the outside.,So all of you who are sittingnon trillions of dollars of cash,,come to us. Right? 
 (Laughter) 
 CA: And what you're specificallynlooking for are investment proposals,that create employmentnin the developing world. 
 JYK: Absolutely. Absolutely.,So these will be, for example,nin infrastructure that brings energy,,builds roads, bridges, ports.,These kinds of thingsnare necessary to create jobs,,but also what we're saying is,you may think that the technologynyou're working on,or the business that you're working on,may not have applicationsnin the developing world,,but look at Zipline.,And that Zipline thing didn't happen,just because of the qualitynof the technology.,It was because they engagednwith the Rwandans early,and used artificial intelligence --,one thing, Rwanda has great broadband --,but these things flyncompletely on their own.,So we will help you do that.nWe will make the introductions.,We will even provide financing.nWe will help you do that. 
 CA: How much capitalnis the World Bank willing to deploy,to back those kinds of efforts? 
 JYK: Chris, you're always getting mento try to do something like this. 
 CA: I'm trying to get you in trouble.nJYK: So here's what we're going to do.,We have 25 billion a yearnthat we're investing in poor countries,,the poorest countries.,And as we investnover the next three years,,25 billion a year,,we have got to think with you,about how to use that moneynmore effectively.,So I can't give you a specific number.nIt depends on the quality of the ideas.,So bring us your ideas,,and I don't think that financingnis going to be the problem. 
 CA: All right, you heard itnfrom the man himself. 
 Jim, thanks so much.nJYK: Thank you. Thank you. 
 (Applause)Cancer.,Many of us have lost family,nfriends or loved ones,to this horrible disease.,I know there are some of younin the audience,who are cancer survivors,,or who are fighting cancer at this moment.,My heart goes out to you.,While this word often conjures upnemotions of sadness and anger and fear,,I bring you good newsnfrom the front lines of cancer research.,The fact is, we are starting to winnthe war on cancer.,In fact, we lie at the intersection,of the three of the most excitingndevelopments within cancer research. 
 The first is cancer genomics.,The genome is a composition,of all the genetic informationnencoded by DNA,in an organism.,In cancers, changesnin the DNA called mutations,are what drive these cancersnto go out of control.,Around 10 years ago,nI was part of the team at Johns Hopkins,that first mappednthe mutations of cancers.,We did this first for colorectal,,breast, pancreatic and brain cancers.,And since then, there have beennover 90 projects in 70 countries,all over the world,,working to understandnthe genetic basis of these diseases.,Today, tens of thousandsnof cancers are understood,down to exquisite molecular detail. 
 The second revolutionnis precision medicine,,also known as "personalized medicine.",Instead of one-size-fits-all methodsnto be able to treat cancers,,there is a whole new class of drugsnthat are able to target cancers,based on their unique genetic profile.,Today, there are a hostnof these tailor-made drugs,,called targeted therapies,,available to physicians even today,to be able to personalizentheir therapy for their patients,,and many others are in development. 
 The third exciting revolutionnis immunotherapy,,and this is really exciting.,Scientists have been ablento leverage the immune system,in the fight against cancer.,For example, there have been waysnwhere we find the off switches of cancer,,and new drugs have been ablento turn the immune system back on,,to be able to fight cancer.,In addition, there are waysnwhere you can take away immune cells,from the body,,train them, engineer themnand put them back into the body,to fight cancer.,Almost sounds likenscience fiction, doesn't it? 
 While I was a researchernat the National Cancer Institute,,I had the privilege of workingnwith some of the pioneers of this field,and watched the development firsthand.,It's been pretty amazing.,Today, over 600 clinical trials are open,,actively recruiting patientsnto explore all aspects in immunotherapy. 
 While these three excitingnrevolutions are ongoing,,unfortunately, this is only the beginning,,and there are still many, many challenges.,Let me illustrate with a patient.,Here is a patientnwith a skin cancer called melanoma.,It's horrible; the cancernhas gone everywhere.,However, scientists were ablento map the mutations of this cancer,and give a specific treatmentnthat targets one of the mutations.,And the result is almost miraculous.,Tumors almost seem to melt away.,Unfortunately, this is notnthe end of the story.,A few months later, this picture is taken.,The tumor has come back.,The question is: Why?,The answer is tumor heterogeneity.,Let me explain. 
 Even a cancer as smallnas one centimeter in diameter,harbors over a hundred millionndifferent cells.,While genetically similar,,there are small differencesnin these different cancers,that make them differently pronento different drugs.,So even if you have a drugnthat's highly effective,,that kills almost all the cells,,there is a chancenthat there's a small population,that's resistant to the drug.,This ultimately is the population,that comes back,,and takes over the patient. 
 So then the question is:nWhat do we do with this information?,Well, the key, then,,is to apply all these excitingnadvancements in cancer therapy earlier,,as soon as we can,,before these resistance clones emerge.,The key to cancer and curing cancernis early detection.,And we intuitively know this.,Finding cancer earlynresults in better outcomes,,and the numbers show this as well.,For example, in ovarian cancer,nif you detect cancer in stage four,,only 17 percent of the womennsurvive at five years.,However, if you are able to detectnthis cancer as early as stage one,,over 92 percent of women will survive.,But the sad fact is, only 15 percentnof women are detected at stage one,,whereas the vast majority, 70 percent,nare detected in stages three and four. 
 We desperately neednbetter detection mechanisms for cancers.,The current best ways to screen cancernfall into one of three categories.,First is medical procedures,,which is like colonoscopynfor colon cancer.,Second is protein biomarkers,nlike PSA for prostate cancer.,Or third, imaging techniques,,such as mammography for breast cancer.,Medical procedures are the gold standard;,however, they are highly invasive,and require a largeninfrastructure to implement.,Protein markers, while effectivenin some populations,,are not very specificnin some circumstances,,resulting in high numbersnof false positives,,which then results in unnecessary work-upsnand unnecessary procedures.,Imaging methods,nwhile useful in some populations,,expose patients to harmful radiation.,In addition, it is not applicablento all patients.,For example, mammography has problemsnin women with dense breasts. 
 So what we need is a methodnthat is noninvasive,,that is light in infrastructure,,that is highly specific,,that also does not have false positives,,does not use any radiation,and is applicable to large populations.,Even more importantly,,we need a methodnto be able to detect cancers,before they're 100 million cells in size.,Does such a technology exist?,Well, I wouldn't be up herengiving a talk if it didn't. 
 I'm excited to tell you aboutnthis latest technology we've developed.,Central to our technologynis a simple blood test.,The blood circulatory system,nwhile seemingly mundane,,is essential for you to survive,,providing oxygennand nutrients to your cells,,and removing waste and carbon dioxide.,Here's a key biological insight:,Cancer cells grow and dienfaster than normal cells,,and when they die,,DNA is shed into the blood system.,Since we know the signaturesnof these cancer cells,from all the different cancerngenome sequencing projects,,we can look for those signals in the blood,to be able to detect these cancers early.,So instead of waiting for cancersnto be large enough to cause symptoms,,or for them to be dense enoughnto show up on imaging,,or for them to be prominent enough,for you to be able to visualizenon medical procedures,,we can start looking for cancersnwhile they are relatively pretty small,,by looking for these small amountsnof DNA in the blood. 
 So let me tell you how we do this.,First, like I said, we start offnwith a simple blood test --,no radiation, no complicated equipment --,a simple blood test.,Then the blood is shipped to us,,and what we donis extract the DNA out of it.,While your body is mostly healthy cells,,most of the DNA that's detectednwill be from healthy cells.,However, there will be a small amount,nless than one percent,,that comes from the cancer cells.,Then we use molecular biology methodsnto be able to enrich this DNA,for areas of the genome which are knownnto be associated with cancer,,based on the informationnfrom the cancer genomics projects.,We're able to then put this DNAninto DNA-sequencing machines,and are able to digitize the DNAninto A's, C's, T's and G's,and have this final readout.,Ultimately, we have informationnof billions of letters,that output from this run.,We then apply statisticalnand computational methods,to be able to findnthe small signal that's present,,indicative of the small amountnof cancer DNA in the blood. 
 So does this actually work in patients?,Well, because there's no waynof really predicting right now,which patients will get cancer,,we use the next best population:,cancers in remission;,specifically, lung cancer.,The sad fact is, even with the best drugsnthat we have today,,most lung cancers come back.,The key, then, is to see,whether we're able to detectnthese recurrences of cancers,earlier than with standard methods. 
 We just finished a major trial,with Professor Charles Swantonnat University College London,,examining this.,Let me walk you throughnan example of one patient.,Here's an example of one patientnwho undergoes surgery,at time point zero,,and then undergoes chemotherapy.,Then the patient is under remission.,He is monitored using clinical examsnand imaging methods.,Around day 450, unfortunately,nthe cancer comes back.,The question is:nAre we able to catch this earlier?,During this whole time,nwe've been collecting blood serially,to be able to measurenthe amount of ctDNA in the blood.,So at the initial time point, as expected,,there's a high levelnof cancer DNA in the blood.,However, this goes away to zeronin subsequent time points,and remains negligiblenafter subsequent points.,However, around day 340, we see the risenof cancer DNA in the blood,,and eventually, it goes up highernfor days 400 and 450. 
 Here's the key, if you've missed it:,At day 340, we see the risenin the cancer DNA in the blood.,That means we are catching this cancernover a hundred days earlier,than traditional methods.,This is a hundred days earliernwhere we can give therapies,,a hundred days earliernwhere we can do surgical interventions,,or even a hundred days lessnfor the cancer to grow,or a hundred days lessnfor resistance to occur.,For some patients, this hundred daysnmeans the matter of life and death.,We're really excitednabout this information. 
 Because of this assignment,nwe've done additional studies now,in other cancers,,including breast cancer, lung cancer,and ovarian cancer,,and I can't wait to see how much earliernwe can find these cancers. 
 Ultimately, I have a dream,,a dream of two vials of blood,,and that, in the future, as part of allnof our standard physical exams,,we'll have two vials of blood drawn.,And from these two vials of bloodnwe will be able to compare,the DNA from all knownnsignatures of cancer,,and hopefully then detect cancersnmonths to even years earlier.,Even with the therapies we have currently,,this could mean that millionsnof lives could be saved.,And if you add on to thatnrecent advancements in immunotherapy,and targeted therapies,,the end of cancer is in sight. 
 The next time you hear the word "cancer,",I want you to add to the emotions: hope.,Hold on.,Cancer researchers all around the worldnare working feverishly,to beat this disease,,and tremendous progress is being made. 
 This is the beginning of the end.,We will win the war on cancer.,And to me, this is amazing news. 
 Thank you.

 (Applause)I'm going to tell you the story of a song.,I was in Madrid one night in 2002,with my teacher and friend Joaquín Sabina,,when he said he had something to give me.,He said,,"Jorge, I have some linesnthat you need to put into a song.,Take these down, take these down.",I looked on the table but all I foundnwas a circular coaster,,on which I wrote the linesnmy teacher dictated.,They were four lines that went like this: 
 "I am a Jewish Moornliving among Christians,I don't know who my God is,nnor who my brothers are." 
 Those lines really madenan impression on me.,I said, "What beautiful lyrics,nJoaquín. Did you write them?",He said no, they were by another composernnamed Chicho Sánchez Ferlosio,,who was less known than Joaquín,nbut also a great poet.,These lines came to me at a time,where I had been wantingnto express something for a while,,but didn't quite know how. 
 I was getting up to leavenand go home to write,,when Joaquín stopped menand said, "Hang on, hang on,",and presented me with this challenge:,"Write the stanzas for this song,in Décimas.",Now, at this point in my life,,I still wasn't completelynsure what Décimas were,,but I was too embarrassednto tell my teacher I didn't know.,So I put on my bestn"Yeah, I totally understand" face,,and went home to look upnwhat Décimas were.,I learned that a Décima is a type of verse,that only exists in Spanish,,and that it has 10 lines.,It's very, very complex --,perhaps the most complex style of stanzanthat we have in Spanish.,It also has a very concretendate of origin,,which is very rare for a style of stanza. 
 The Décima was invented in Spain in 1591,,by a guy named Vicente Espinel,na musician and poet from Málaga.,And listen to this coincidence:nhe was the same guy,who added the sixth string,to what would later be callednthe Spanish guitar.,This string right here --,it's called the "bordona." 
 From Spain, the Décima, with its 10 lines,,crosses over to America,njust like the Spanish guitar,,but in contrast to the Décima,,the Spanish guitar continues to live today,on both sides of the Atlantic.,But the Décima, in Spain, its birthplace,,disappeared; it died out.,It died out about 200 years ago,,and yet in Latin America,nfrom Mexico to Chile,,all our countries maintainnsome form of the Décima,in our popular traditions. 
 In each place, they've given itna different name,,and set it to different music.,It has a lot of different names --nmore than 20 in total on the continent.,In Mexico, for example,nit's called the "Son Jarocho,","Canto de mejorana" in Panama;,"Galerón" in Venezuela;,"Payada" in Uruguay and Argentina;,"Repentismo" in Cuba.,In Peru, they call it the Peruvian Décima,,because the Décima becomesnso integrated into our traditions,,that if someone asks, peoplenfrom each place are completely convinced,that the Décima was inventednin their country. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's also got a really surprising feature,,which is that despite the factnthat it developed independently,in each of the different countries,,it maintains even today,n400 years after its creation,,exactly the same rhyme,nsyllable and line structure --,the same structure Vicente Espinel gave itnduring the Spanish Baroque period.,Here's the structure --,I'll give you the basic ideanand then later you can look online,and learn more about it. 
 The Décima is ten lines long;neach line has eight syllables.,The first line rhymesnwith the fourth and the fifth;,the second line, with the third;,the sixth line,nwith the seventh and the tenth;,and the eighth line rhymes with the ninth.,It's a bit complicated, to be honest.,And me -- imagine me,ntrying to write in Décimas.,But it's not as complicated as it seems.,Plus, it's amazing that it's survivednwith the same structure,for more than four centuries.,It's not that complicated, because it hasnan impressive musicality to it,,a type of musicality,that's very hard to describe technically.,I prefer that you listen to it.,So I'm going to recite a Décima,,one of the Décimasnthat I wrote for this song.,I'm going to ask that you concentratenjust on the musicality of the rhymes.,For those of you with headphones on --,I see that some of you are listeningnto the translation --,please take them off for a minute. 
 (English) Take your headphones off,nit you have them. 
 (English) Forget about the meaningnof the words for a few seconds, 
 (English) and then you'll put them back. 
 (English) Forget about the structure. 
 (Spanish) Forget about the structure. 
 (English) And just ... it's all aboutnthe choreography of sound of the Décima. 
 (Spanish) A choreography of sound. 
 (Sings in Spanish) "There is not one deathnthat does not cause me pain,,there are no winners,,here’s nothing but sufferingnand another life blown away.,War is a terrible schoolnno matter what the disguise,,forgive me for not enlistingnunder any flag,,any daydream is worth morenthan a sad piece of cloth." 
 That's a Décima. 
 (English) You can putnyour headphones back on. 
 (Applause) 
 (English) Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 I also applaud Vicente Espinel,nbecause here it is 426 years later,,and the Décima lives on everywhere,in its original state. 
 I wrote three like that one;nyou just heard the second.,I wrote the first one having onlynrecently learned how,,and it has some errors in terms of meter,,so it's not presentablenin its current state.,But the one I sang was good, more or less.,So: What was it about?,What was the meaning behind those lines? 
 I had just returned from doingna concert in Israel,,and I was very emotional over a problemnthat hits really close to home,,which is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.,I'll explain: my dad's family is Jewish,,and my mom's familynare non-practicing Christians.,I was raised in a homenwhere the two traditions lived together,more or less in harmony.,It wasn't unusual to see my Jewish grandpandressed as Santa Claus, for example,,or to see my non-Jewish grandpanat the synagogue wearing his kippah,,at family celebrations, wearing the samenexpression that I probably had,when Sabina told me -- 
 (Laughter) 
 that he had some Décima lines for me.,For someone raisednin that kind of environment,,it's especially painful to seenthe difficulty the opposing parties have,in putting themselves in the othernside's shoes even for a moment.,So that's what I wrote about. 
 I already had the lyrics,,I had the form -- the Décima --nand the content.,I needed to write the music.,I'll give you some context.,I had only recently moved from Uruguay,nwhere I'm from, to Spain.,And I was feeling very raw with nostalgia,,like many of you here,nwho are away from home.,And I wanted my songnto be very, very Uruguayan,,the most Uruguayan type of songnthere is -- the milonga.,So now, I had been studying the Décima,nand after finding out,that everyone tried to claimnthe Décima as their own,,that it was invented in their country,,it made me wonder:,What does it mean when we saynthe milonga is Uruguayan? 
 The milonga has a rhythmic patternnthat we musicians call 3-3-2. 
 (Counts out the beats) One two three,none two three, one two. 
 And it has a characteristic emphasis. 
 (Sings) 
 But this characteristic rhythm pattern,comes from Africa.,In the ninth century you could find itnin the brothels of Persia,,and in the thirteenth,,in Spain, from where,nfive centuries later,,it would cross over to Americanwith the African slaves.,Meanwhile, in the Balkans,nit encounters the Roma scale -- 
 (Sings) 
 which in part, gives birthnto klezmer music,,which Ukrainian Jewish immigrantsnbring to Brooklyn, New York.,They sing it in their banquet halls. 
 (Sings "Hava Nagila") 
 And their neighbor,nan Argentine kid of Italian origin,named Astor Piazzolla,,hears it,,assimilates it,and transforms the tangonof the second half of the 20th century,with his ... 
 (Counts out the beats) One two three,none two three, one two. 
 (Sings "Adios Nonino") 
 He also played it on his bandoneon,na 19th-century German instrument,created for churchesnthat couldn't afford to buy organs,,and that ends up, incredibly,nin Río de la Plata,,forming the very essencenof the tango and the milonga,,in the very same way another instrumentnjust as important as the bandoneon did:,the Spanish guitar. 
 (Applause) 
 To which, by the way,nVicente Espinel, in the 16th century,,added a sixth string.,It's amazing how all these thingsnare coming full circle. 
 What have I learned in these 15 yearsnsince the song was born,from going all over the worldnwith four lines written on a coaster,from a bar in Madrid?,That Décimas,,the milonga,,songs, people --,the closer you get to them,,the more complex their identity becomes,,and the more nuances and details appear.,I learned that identitynis infinitely dense,,like an infinite series of real numbers,,and that even if you get very close,and zoom in,,it never ends. 
 Before I sing you a song and say goodbye,,allow me to tell you one last story.,Not long ago, we were in Mexiconafter a concert.,And since the concert promoters know me,,they knew I was a Décima freaknand that everywhere I go I ask about it,,insisting on hearing Décima artists.,So they organized a son jarocho shownfor me at their house.,If you recall, the son jarochonis one of the styles of music,that uses Décimas in its verses. 
 When these amazing musiciansnfinished playing,what is for me, something amazing,nwhich is the son jarocho,,they finished playing and were ...,I went up to greet them, really excited,,getting ready to thank themnfor their gift of music,,and this young kid says to me --,and he says it with the bestnof intentions -- he says,,"We're very proud, sir, to be keepingnalive the purest origins,of our Mexican identity.",And to tell you the truth,nI didn't really know what to say. 
 (Laughter) 
 I stood there looking at him.nI gave him a hug and left, but ... 
 (Laughter) 
 But he was right, too, though. Right?,In reality, the Décima is its origin,nbut at the same time,,just like in the milonganand in the Décima,,are the roots of many more culturesnfrom all over the place, like he said. 
 Later, when I got back to the hotel,nI thought about it for a while.,And I thought:,things only look pure,if you look at them from far away.,It's very importantnto know about our roots,,to know where we come from,nto understand our history.,But at the same time, as importantnas knowing where we're from,,is understanding that deep down,,we're all from nowhere,and a little bit from everywhere. 
 Thank you very much.

 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm a journalist,,and I'm an immigrant.,And these two conditions define me. 
 I was born in Mexico,,but I've spent more than half my lifenreporting in the United States,,a country which was itselfncreated by immigrants.,As a reporter,and as a foreigner,,I've learned that neutrality,,silence,and fear aren't the best options --,not in journalism, nor in life.,Neutrality,is often an excuse that we journalists use,to hide from our true responsibility.,What is that responsibility?,It is to question,and to challenge,those in positions of power.,That's what journalism is for. 
 That's the beauty of journalism:,to question and challenge the powerful.,Of course, we have the obligationnto report reality as it is,,not how we would like it to be.,In that sense, I agreenwith the principle of objectivity:,if a house is blue, I say that it's blue.,If there are a million unemployed people,nI say there are a million.,But neutrality,won't necessarily lead me to the truth.,Even if I'm unequivocally scrupulous,,and I present both sides of a news item --,the Democratic and the Republican,,the liberal and the conservative,,the government's and the opposition's --,in the end, I have no guarantee,,nor are any of us guaranteednthat we'll know what's true,and what's not true.,Life is much more complicated,,and I believe journalism should reflectnthat very complexity. 
 To be clear: I refuse,to be a tape recorder.,I didn't become a journalistnto be a tape recorder.,I know what you're going to say:nno one uses tape recorders nowadays. 
 (Laughter) 
 In that case, I refusento take out my cell phone,and hit the record button,and point it in front of menas if I were at a concert,,like a fan at a concert.,That is not true journalism.,Contrary to what many people think,,journalists are makingnvalue judgments all the time,,ethical and moral judgments.,And we're always making decisionsnthat are exceedingly personal,and extraordinarily subjective. 
 For example:,What happens if you're callednto cover a dictatorship,,like Augusto Pinochet's regime in Chile,or Fidel Castro's in Cuba?,Are you going to report only whatnthe general and commander want,,or will you confront them?,What happens if you find outnthat in your country,or in the country next door,,students are disappearing,and hidden graves are appearing,,or that millions of dollarsnare disappearing from the budget,and that ex-presidents are magicallynnow multimillionaires?,Will you report only the official version?,Or what happens,if you're assigned to cover,the presidential electionsnof the primary superpower,,and one of the candidates makesncomments that are racist,,sexist,and xenophobic?,That happened to me.,And I want to tell you what I did,,but first, let me explainnwhere I'm coming from,,so you can understand my reaction. 
 I grew up in Mexico City,nthe oldest of five brothers,,and our family simply couldn't affordnto pay for all of our college tuition.,So I studied in the morning,nand worked in the afternoon.,Eventually,,I got the job I had always wanted:,television reporter.,It was a big opportunity.,But as I was working onnmy third story, I ended up,criticizing the president,,and questioning the lacknof democracy in Mexico.,In Mexico, from 1929 to 2000,nelections were always rigged;,the incumbent presidentnwould hand-pick his successor.,That's not true democracy.,To me it seemed like a brilliant ideanto expose the president,,but to my boss -- 
 (Laughter) 
 My boss didn't thinknit was such a great idea.,At that time, the presidential office,nLos Pinos, had issued a direct censor,against the media.,My boss, who, aside from being in chargenof the show I worked for,,was also in charge of a soccer team.,I always suspected that he was moreninterested in goals,than in the news.,He censored my report.,He asked me to change it, I said no,,so he put another journalist on the story,to write what I was supposed to say.,I did not want to bena censored journalist.,I don't know where I found the strength,,but I wrote my letter of resignation.,And so at 24 years of age -- just 24 --,I made the most difficult and mostntranscendental decision of my life.,Not only did I resign from television,,but I had also decidednto leave my country. 
 I sold my car, a beat-upnlittle red Volkswagen,,came up with some money,and said goodbye to my family,,to my friends,,to my streets,,to my favorite haunts -- to my tacos -- 
 (Laughter) 
 and I bought a one-way ticket,to Los Angeles, California.,And so I became,one of the 250 million immigrantsnthat exist in the world. 
 Ask any immigrant,about the first day they arrivednin their new country,,and you'll find that they remembernabsolutely everything,,like it was a movie with background music.,In my case, I arrived in Los Angeles,nthe sun was setting,,and everything I owned --,a guitar, a suitcase and some documents --,I could carry all of it,with my two hands.,That feeling of absolute freedom,,I haven't experienced since.,And I survived with what little I had.,I obtained a student visa; I was studying.,I ate a lot of lettuce and bread,nbecause that's all I had.,Finally, in 1984,,I landed my first job as a TV reporternin the United States. 
 And the first thing I noticednwas that in the US,,my colleagues criticized --nand mercilessly --,then president Ronald Reagan,,and absolutely nothing happened;nno one censored them.,And I thought:,I love this country. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 And that's how it's been,for more than 30 years:,reporting with total freedom,,and being treated as an equalndespite being an immigrant --,until, without warning,,I was assigned to cover the recentnUS presidential election. 
 On June 16, 2015,,a candidate who would eventually becomenthe president of the United States,said that Mexican immigrants,were criminals,,drug traffickers,and rapists.,And I knew,that he was lying.,I knew he was wrongnfor one very simple reason:,I'm a Mexican immigrant.,And we're not like that.,So I did what any other reporternwould have done:,I wrote him a letter by hand,requesting an interview,,and I sent it to his Tower in New York. 
 The next day,I was at work,,and I suddenly began to receivenhundreds of calls and texts,on my cell phone,,some more insulting than others.,I didn't know what was happeningnuntil my friend came into my office,and said, "They publishednyour cell number online.",They actually did that.,Here's the letter they sent,where they gave out my number.,Don't bother writing it down, OK?nI already changed it. 
 (Laughter) 
 But I learned two things.,The first one is that you shouldnnever, never, ever,give your cell number to Donald Trump. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 The second lesson was thatnI needed to stop being neutral,at that point.,From then on, my missionnas a journalist changed.,I would confront the candidate,and show that he was wrong,,that what he said about immigrantsnin the US was not true. 
 Let me give you some figures.,Ninety-seven percent of all undocumentednpeople in the United States,are good people.,Less than three percentnhave committed a serious crime,,or "felony," as they say in English.,In comparison, six percent of US citizensnhave committed a serious crime.,The conclusion is that undocumentednimmigrants behave much better,than US citizens. 
 Based on that data, I made a plan.,Eight weeks after they publishednmy cell number,,I obtained a press passnfor a press conference,for the candidatengaining momentum in the polls.,I decided to confront him,in person.,But ...,things didn't turn out exactlynas I had planned; watch: 
 [Donald Trump Press ConferencenDubuque, Iowa] 
 (Video) Jorge Ramos: Mr. Trump,nI have a question about immigration. 
 Donald Trump: Who's next? Yes, please. 
 JR: Your immigration plannis full of empty promises. 
 DT: Excuse me, you weren't called.nSit down. Sit down! 
 JR: I'm a reporter; as an immigrantnand as a US citizen,,I have the right to ask a question. 
 DT: No you don't.nJR: I have the right to ask -- 
 DT: Go back to Univision. 
 JR: This is the question:,You cannot deport 11 million people.,You cannot build a 1900-mile wall.,You cannot deny citizenshipnto children in this country. 
 DT: Sit down.nJR: And with those ideas -- 
 DT: You weren't called. 
 JR: I'm a reporter and I have --nDon't touch me, sir. 
 Guard 1: Please don't disrupt.nYou're being disruptive. 
 JR: I have the right to ask a question.nG1: Yes, in order. In turn, sir. 
 Guard 2: Do you havenyour media credential? 
 JR: I have the right -- 
 G2: Where? Let me see.nJR: It's over there. 
 Man: Whoever's coming out, stay out. 
 G2: You've just got to wait your turn. 
 Man: You're very rude. It's not about you. 
 JR: It's not about you --nMan: Get out of my country! 
 Man: It's not about you. 
 JR: I'm a US citizen, too. 
 Man: Well ...whatever.nNo, Univision. It's not about you. 
 JR: It's not about you.nIt's about the United States. 
 (Applause) 
 (Applause ends) 
 Whenever I see that video,,the first thing I alwaysnthink is that hate,is contagious.,If you notice, after the candidate says,n"Go back to Univision" -- that's code;,what he's telling menis, "Get out of here.",One member of his entourage,nas if he had been given permission, said,,"Get out of my country,",not knowing that I'm also a US citizen. 
 After watching this video many times,,I also think that in ordernto break free from neutrality --,and for it to be a true break --,one has to lose their fear,,and then learn how to say, "No;,I'm not going to be quiet.,I'm not going to sit down.,And I'm not going to leave.",The word "no" -- 
 (Applause) 
 "no" is the most powerful wordnthat exists in any language,,and it always precedesnany important change in our lives.,And I think there's enormous dignity,and it generates a great deal of respect,to be able to step back,and to push back and say,,"No." 
 Elie Wiesel -- Holocaust survivor,,Nobel Peace Prize recipient,and who, unfortunately,nwe lost very recently --,said some very wise words:,"We must take a side.,Neutrality helps only the oppressor,,never the victim.",And he's completely right.,We journalists are obligatednto take sides in certain circumstances;,in cases of racism,,discrimination,,corruption,,lying to the public,,dictatorships and human rights,,we need to set asidenneutrality and indifference. 
 Spanish has a great word,to describe the stancenthat journalists should take.,The word is n"contrapoder [anti-establishment].",Basically, we journalistsnshould be on the opposite side,from those in power.,But if you're in bed with politicians,,if you go to the baptism or weddingnof the governor's son,or if you want to benthe president's buddy,,how are you going to criticize them?,When I'm assigned to interviewna powerful or influential person,,I always keep two things in mind:,if I don't ask this difficultnand uncomfortable question,,no one else is going to;,and that I'm never going to seenthis person again.,So I'm not looking to makena good impression,or to forge a connection.,In the end, if I have to choosenbetween being the president's friend,or enemy,,I always prefer to be their enemy. 
 In closing:,I know this is a difficult timento be an immigrant and a journalist,,but now more than ever,,we need journalists who are prepared,,at any given moment,,to set neutrality aside.,Personally, I feel likenI've been preparing for this moment,my whole life.,When they censored me when I was 24,,I learned that neutrality, fearnand silence often make you an accomplice,in crime, abuse,and injustice.,And being an accomplice to power,is never good journalism. 
 Now, at 59 years old,,I only hope to have a tiny bit,of the courage and mentalnclarity I had at 24,,and that way, never again,remain quiet.,Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Ten years ago,,computer vision researchersnthought that getting a computer,to tell the differencenbetween a cat and a dog,would be almost impossible,,even with the significant advancenin the state of artificial intelligence.,Now we can do it at a levelngreater than 99 percent accuracy.,This is called image classification --,give it an image,nput a label to that image --,and computers knownthousands of other categories as well. 
 I'm a graduate studentnat the University of Washington,,and I work on a project called Darknet,,which is a neural network framework,for training and testingncomputer vision models.,So let's just see what Darknet thinks,of this image that we have.,When we run our classifier,on this image,,we see we don't just getna prediction of dog or cat,,we actually getnspecific breed predictions.,That's the levelnof granularity we have now.,And it's correct.,My dog is in fact a malamute. 
 So we've made amazing stridesnin image classification,,but what happensnwhen we run our classifier,on an image that looks like this?,Well ...,We see that the classifier comes backnwith a pretty similar prediction.,And it's correct,nthere is a malamute in the image,,but just given this label,nwe don't actually know that much,about what's going on in the image.,We need something more powerful.,I work on a problemncalled object detection,,where we look at an imagenand try to find all of the objects,,put bounding boxes around them,and say what those objects are.,So here's what happensnwhen we run a detector on this image. 
 Now, with this kind of result,,we can do a lot morenwith our computer vision algorithms.,We see that it knowsnthat there's a cat and a dog.,It knows their relative locations,,their size.,It may even know some extra information.,There's a book sitting in the background.,And if you want to build a systemnon top of computer vision,,say a self-driving vehiclenor a robotic system,,this is the kindnof information that you want.,You want something so thatnyou can interact with the physical world.,Now, when I started workingnon object detection,,it took 20 secondsnto process a single image.,And to get a feel for whynspeed is so important in this domain,,here's an example of an object detector,that takes two secondsnto process an image.,So this is 10 times faster,than the 20-seconds-per-image detector,,and you can see that by the timenit makes predictions,,the entire state of the world has changed,,and this wouldn't be very useful,for an application. 
 If we speed this upnby another factor of 10,,this is a detector runningnat five frames per second.,This is a lot better,,but for example,,if there's any significant movement,,I wouldn't want a systemnlike this driving my car. 
 This is our detection systemnrunning in real time on my laptop.,So it smoothly tracks menas I move around the frame,,and it's robust to a wide varietynof changes in size,,pose,,forward, backward.,This is great.,This is what we really need,if we're going to build systemsnon top of computer vision. 
 (Applause) 
 So in just a few years,,we've gone from 20 seconds per image,to 20 milliseconds per image,na thousand times faster.,How did we get there?,Well, in the past,nobject detection systems,would take an image like this,and split it into a bunch of regions,and then run a classifiernon each of these regions,,and high scores for that classifier,would be consideredndetections in the image.,But this involved running a classifiernthousands of times over an image,,thousands of neural network evaluationsnto produce detection.,Instead, we trained a single networknto do all of detection for us.,It produces all of the bounding boxesnand class probabilities simultaneously.,With our system, instead of lookingnat an image thousands of times,to produce detection,,you only look once,,and that's why we call itnthe YOLO method of object detection.,So with this speed,nwe're not just limited to images;,we can process video in real time.,And now, instead of just seeingnthat cat and dog,,we can see them move aroundnand interact with each other. 
 This is a detector that we trained,on 80 different classes,in Microsoft's COCO dataset.,It has all sorts of thingsnlike spoon and fork, bowl,,common objects like that.,It has a variety of more exotic things:,animals, cars, zebras, giraffes.,And now we're going to do something fun.,We're just going to gonout into the audience,and see what kind of things we can detect.,Does anyone want a stuffed animal?,There are some teddy bears out there.,And we can turn downnour threshold for detection a little bit,,so we can find more of you guysnout in the audience.,Let's see if we can get these stop signs.,We find some backpacks.,Let's just zoom in a little bit.,And this is great.,And all of the processingnis happening in real time,on the laptop. 
 And it's important to remember,that this is a general purposenobject detection system,,so we can train this for any image domain.,The same code that we use,to find stop signs or pedestrians,,bicycles in a self-driving vehicle,,can be used to find cancer cells,in a tissue biopsy.,And there are researchers around the globenalready using this technology,for advances in thingsnlike medicine, robotics.,This morning, I read a paper,where they were taking a censusnof animals in Nairobi National Park,with YOLO as partnof this detection system.,And that's because Darknet is open source,and in the public domain,nfree for anyone to use. 
 (Applause) 
 But we wanted to make detectionneven more accessible and usable,,so through a combinationnof model optimization,,network binarization and approximation,,we actually have object detectionnrunning on a phone. 
 (Applause) 
 And I'm really excited becausennow we have a pretty powerful solution,to this low-level computer vision problem,,and anyone can take itnand build something with it.,So now the rest is up to all of you,and people around the worldnwith access to this software,,and I can't wait to see what peoplenwill build with this technology. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Today I'm here, actually,nto pose you a question.,What is life?,It has been really puzzling menfor more than 25 years,,and will probably continue doing sonfor the next 25 years.,This is the thesis I didnwhen I was still in undergraduate school.,While my colleagues still treatedncomputers as big calculators,,I started to teach computers to learn.,I built digital lady beetles,and tried to learn from real lady beetles,njust to do one thing:,search for food.,And after very simple neural network --,genetic algorithms and so on --,look at the pattern.,They're almost identical to real life.,A very striking learning experiencenfor a twenty-year-old. 
 Life is a learning program.,When you looknat all of this wonderful world,,every species hasnits own learning program.,The learning program is genome,,and the code of that program is DNA.,The different genomes of each speciesnrepresent different survival strategies.,They represent hundreds of millionsnof years of evolution.,The interaction betweennevery species' ancestor,and the environment. 
 I was really fascinated about the world,,about the DNA,,about, you know, the language of life,,the program of learning.,So I decided to co-foundnthe institute to read them.,I read many of them.,We probably read more than halfnof the prior animal genomes in the world.,I mean, up to date. 
 We did learn a lot.,We did sequence, also,none species many, many times ...,human genome.,We sequenced the first Asian.,I sequenced it myself many, many times,,just to take advantage of that platform.,Look at all those repeating base pairs:,ATCG.,You don't understand anything there.,But look at that one base pair.,Those five letters, the AGGAA.,These five SNPs representna very specific haplotype,in the Tibetan population,around the gene called EPAS1.,That gene has been proved --,it's highly selective --,it's the most significant signaturenof positive selection of Tibetans,for the higher altitude adaptation.,You know what?,These five SNPs were the resultnof integration of Denisovans,,or Denisovan-like individuals into humans. 
 This is the reasonnwhy we need to read those genomes.,To understand history,,to understand what kindnof learning process,the genome has been throughnfor the millions of years.,By reading a genome,nit can give you a lot of information --,tells you the bugs in the genome --,I mean, birth defects,nmonogenetic disorders.,Reading a drop of blood,could tell you why you got a fever,,or it tells you which medicinenand dosage needs to be used,when you're sick, especially for cancer. 
 A lot of things could be studied,nbut look at that:,30 years ago, we were still poor in China.,Only .67 percent of the Chinesenadult population had diabetes.,Look at now: 11 percent.,Genetics cannot change over 30 years --,only one generation.,It must be something different.,Diet?,The environment?,Lifestyle?,Even identical twinsncould develop totally differently.,It could be one becomesnvery obese, the other is not.,One develops a cancernand the other does not.,Not mentioning livingnin a very stressed environment. 
 I moved to Shenzhen 10 years ago ...,for some reason, people may know.,If the gene's under stress,,it behaves totally differently.,Life is a journey.,A gene is just a starting point,,not the end.,You have this statistical risknof certain diseases when you are born.,But every day you make different choices,,and those choices will increasenor decrease the risk of certain diseases.,But do you knownwhere you are on the curve?,What's the past curve look like?,What kind of decisionsnare you facing every day?,And what kind of decision is the right one,to make your own right curvenover your life journey?,What's that? 
 The only thing you cannot change,,you cannot reverse back,,is time.,Probably not yet; maybe in the future. 
 (Laughter) 
 Well, you cannot changenthe decision you've made,,but can we do something there?,Can we actually try to runnmultiple options on me,,and try to predict rightnon the consequence,,and be able to make the right choice?,After all,,we are our choices. 
 These lady beetles came to me afterwards.,25 years ago, I madenthe digital lady beetles,to try to simulate real lady beetles.,Can I make a digital me ...,to simulate me?,I understand the neuralnnetwork could become,much more sophisticatednand complicated there.,Can I make that one,,and try to run multiple optionsnon that digital me --,to compute that?,Then I could live in different universes,,in parallel, at the same time.,Then I would choosenwhatever is good for me. 
 I probably have the most comprehensivendigital me on the planet.,I've spent a lot of dollarsnon me, on myself.,And the digital me told menI have a genetic risk of gout,by all of those things there.,You need different technology to do that.,You need the proteins, genes,,you need metabolized antibodies,,you need to screen all your body,about the bacterias and virusesncovering you, or in you.,You need to havenall the smart devices there --,smart cars, smart house, smart tables,,smart watch, smart phonento track all of your activities there.,The environment is important --,everything's important --,and don't forget the smart toilet. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's such a waste, right?,Every day, so much invaluable informationnjust has been flushed into the water.,And you need them.,You need to measure all of them.,You need to be able to measureneverything around you,and compute them. 
 And the digital me told menI have a genetic defect.,I have a very high risk of gout.,I don't feel anything now,,I'm still healthy.,But look at my uric acid level.,It's double the normal range.,And the digital me searchednall the medicine books,,and it tells me, "OK, you couldndrink burdock tea" --,I cannot even pronounce it right -- 
 (Laughter) 
 That is from old Chinese wisdom.,And I drank that tea for three months.,My uric acid has now gone back to normal.,I mean, it worked for me. 
 All those thousands of yearsnof wisdom worked for me.,I was lucky.,But I'm probably not lucky for you.,All of this existingnknowledge in the world,cannot possibly be efficient enoughnor personalized enough for yourself.,The only way to makenthat digital me work ...,is to learn from yourself.,You have to ask a lotnof questions about yourself:,"What if?" -- 
 I'm being jet-lagged now here.,You don't probably see it, but I do.,What if I eat less?,When I took metformin,nsupposedly to live longer?,What if I climb Mt. Everest?,It's not that easy.,Or run a marathon?,What if I drink a bottle of mao-tai,,which is a Chinese liquor,,and I get really drunk?,I was doing a video rehearsal last timenwith the folks here,,when I was drunk,,and I totally deliveredna different speech. 
 (Laughter) 
 What if I work less, right?,I have been less stressed, right?,So that probably never happened to me,,I was really stressed every day,,but I hope I could be less stressed.,These early studies told us,,even with the same banana,,we have totally differentnglucose-level reactions,over different individuals. 
 How about me?,What is the right breakfast for me?,I need to do two weeksnof controlled experiments,,of testing all kinds of differentnfood ingredients on me,,and check my body's reaction.,And I don't knownthe precise nutrition for me,,for myself. 
 Then I wanted to searchnall the Chinese old wisdom,about how I can live longer,nand healthier.,I did it.,Some of them are really unachievable.,I did this once last October,,by not eating for seven days.,I did a fast for seven daysnwith six partners of mine.,Look at those people.,One smile.,You know why he smiled?,He cheated. 
 (Laughter) 
 He drank one cup of coffee at night,,and we caught it from the data. 
 (Laughter) 
 We measured everything from the data. 
 We were able to track them,,and we could really see --,for example, my immune system,,just to give you a little hint there.,My immune system changedndramatically over 24 hours there.,And my antibody regulates my proteins,for that dramatic change.,And everybody was doing that.,Even if we're essentiallyntotally different at the very beginning.,And that probably will benan interesting treatment in the future,for cancer and things like that. 
 It becomes very, very interesting.,But something you probablyndon't want to try,,like drinking fecal waternfrom a healthier individual,,which will make you feel healthier.,This is from old Chinese wisdom.,Look at that, right?,Like 1,700 years ago,,it's already there, in the book.,But I still hate the smell. 
 (Laughter) 
 I want to find out the true way to do it,,maybe find a combination of cocktailsnof bacterias and drink it,,it probably will make me better.,So I'm trying to do that. 
 Even though I'm trying this hard,,it's so difficult to test outnall possible conditions.,It's not possible to donall kinds of experiments at all ...,but we do have seven billionnlearning programs on this planet.,Seven billion.,And every programnis running in different conditions,and doing different experiments.,Can we all measure them? 
 Seven years ago,nI wrote an essay in "Science",to celebrate the human genome'sn10-year anniversary.,I said, "Sequence yourself,,for one and for all.",But now I'm going to say,,"Digitalize yourself for one and for all.",When we make this digital meninto a digital we,,when we try to form an internet of life,,when people can learn from each other,,when people can learnnfrom their experience,,their data,,when people can really formna digital me by themselves,and we learn from it,,the digital we will bentotally different with a digital me. 
 But it can only come from the digital me.,And this is what I try to propose here.,Join me --,become we,,and everybody should build upntheir own digital me,,because only by thatnwill you learn more about you,,about me,,about us ...,about the question I just posednat the very beginning:,"What is life?" 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson:nOne quick question for you.,I mean, the work is amazing.,I suspect one question people have is,,as we look forward to these amazingntechnical possibilities,of personalized medicine,,in the near-term it feels likenthey're only going to be affordable,for a few people, right?,It costs many dollars to donall the sequencing and so forth.,Is this going to lead to a kind of,,you know, increasing inequality?,Or do you have this visionnthat the knowledge that you get,from the pioneers,can actually benpretty quickly disseminated,to help a broader set of recipients? 
 Jun Wang: Well, good question.,I'll tell you that seven years ago,nwhen I co-founded BGI,,and served as the CEOnof the company there,,the only goal there for me to do,was to drive the sequencing cost down.,It started from 100 million dollarsnper human genome.,Now, it's a couple hundred dollarsnfor a human genome.,The only reason to do itnis to get more people to benefit from it.,So for the digital me,nit's the same thing.,Now, you probably need,,you know, one million dollarsnto digitize a person.,I think it has to be 100 dollars.,It has to be free for many of those peoplenthat urgently need that. 
 So this is our goal.,And it seems that with allnthis merging of the technology,,I'm thinking that in the very near future,,let's say three to five years,,it will come to reality.,And this is the whole ideanof why I founded iCarbonX,,my second company.,It's really trying to get the cost down,to a level where every individualncould have the benefit. 
 CA: All right, so the dream is notnelite health services for few,,it's to really try,and actually make overall health carenmuch more cost effective -- 
 JW: But we startednfrom some early adopters,,people believing ideas and so on,,but eventually, it will becomeneverybody's benefit. 
 CA: Well, Jun, I thinknit's got to be true to say,you're one of the most amazingnscientific minds on the planet,,and it's an honor to have you. 
 JW: Thank you. 
 (Applause)Getting a college education,is a 20-year investment.,When you're growing up poor,,you're not accustomednto thinking that far ahead.,Instead, you're thinking aboutnwhere you're going to get your next meal,and how your familynis going to pay rent that month.,Besides, my parentsnand my friends' parents,seemed to be doing just finendriving taxis and working as janitors.,It wasn't until I was a teenager,when I realized I didn'tnwant to do those things.,By then, I was two-thirds of the waynthrough my education,,and it was almost too latento turn things around. 
 When you grow up poor,nyou want to be rich.,I was no different.,I'm the second-oldest of seven,,and was raised by a single mothernon government aid,in Queens, New York.,By virtue of growing up low-income,,my siblings and I wentnto some of New York City's,most struggling public schools.,I had over 60 absencesnwhen I was in seventh grade,,because I didn't feel like going to class.,My high school hadna 55 percent graduation rate,,and even worse,,only 20 percent of the kids graduating,were college-ready. 
 When I actually did make it to college,,I told my friend Brennan,how our teachers would always ask usnto raise our hands,if we were going to college.,I was taken aback when Brennan said,,"Karim, I've never been askednthat question before.",It was always, "What collegenare you going to?",Just the way that question is phrased,made it unacceptable for himnnot to have gone to college. 
 Nowadays I get asked a different question.,"How were you able to make it out?",For years I said I was lucky,,but it's not just luck.,When my older brother and Ingraduated from high school,at the very same time,and he later dropped outnof a two-year college,,I wanted to understand why he dropped out,and I kept studying.,It wasn't until I got to Cornellnas a Presidential Research Scholar,that I started to learn aboutnthe very real educational consequences,of being raised by a single mothernon government aid,and attending the schools that I did.,That's when my older brother's trajectorynbegan to make complete sense to me. 
 I also learned that our most admirableneducation reformers,,people like Arne Duncan,nthe former US Secretary of Education,,or Wendy Kopp, the foundernof Teach For America,,had never attended an inner citynpublic school like I had.,So much of our education reformnis driven by a sympathetic approach,,where people are saying,,"Let's go and helpnthese poor inner city kids,,or these poor black and Latino kids,",instead of an empathetic approach,,where someone like me, who had grown upnin this environment, could say,,"I know the adversities that you're facing,and I want to help you overcome them." 
 Today when I get questionsnabout how I made it out,,I share that one of the biggest reasons,is that I wasn't ashamed to ask for help.,In a typical middle classnor affluent household,,if a kid is struggling,,there's a good chance that a parentnor a teacher will come to their rescue,even if they don't ask for help.,However, if that same kidnis growing up poor,and doesn't ask for help,,there's a good chancenthat no one will help them.,There are virtuallynno social safety nets available. 
 So seven years ago,,I started to reformnour public education system,shaped by my firsthand perspective.,And I started with summer school.,Research tells us that two-thirdsnof the achievement gap,,which is the disparitynin educational attainment,between rich kids and poor kids,or black kids and white kids,,could be directly attributednto the summer learning loss.,In low-income neighborhoods,nkids forget almost three months,of what they learnednduring the school year,over the summer.,They return to school in the fall,,and their teachersnspend another two months,reteaching them old material.,That's five months.,The school year in the United Statesnis only 10 months.,If kids lose five months of learningnevery single year,,that's half of their education.,Half. 
 If kids were in school over the summer,nthen they couldn't regress,,but traditional summer schoolnis poorly designed.,For kids it feels like punishment,,and for teachersnit feels like babysitting.,But how can we expect principalsnto execute an effective summer program,when the school yearnends the last week of June,and then summer school startsnjust one week later?,There just isn't enough timento find the right people,,sort out the logistics,,and design an engaging curriculumnthat excites kids and teachers. 
 But what if we created a programnover the summer,that empowered teachersnas teaching coaches,to develop aspiring educators?,What if we empoweredncollege-educated role models,as teaching fellows,to help kids realizentheir college ambitions?,What if empowered high-achieving kids,as mentors to tutor their younger peers,and inspire themnto invest in their education?,What if we empowered all kids as scholars,,asked them what collegesnthey were going to,,designed a summer schoolnthey want to attend,to completely eliminatenthe summer learning loss,and close two-thirdsnof the achievement gap? 
 By this summer, my team will have servednover 4,000 low-income children,,trained over 300 aspiring teachers,and created more than 1,000 seasonal jobs,across some of New York City'snmost disadvantaged neighborhoods. 
 (Applause) 
 And our kids are succeeding.,Two years of independent evaluations,tell us that our kidsneliminate the summer learning loss,and make growth of one month in math,and two months in reading.,So instead of returning to schoolnin the fall three months behind,,they now go back four months ahead in math,and five months ahead in reading. 
 (Applause) 
 Ten years ago, if you would have told me,that I'd graduate in the top 10 percentnof my class from an Ivy League institution,and have an opportunity to make a dentnon our public education system,just by tackling two monthsnof the calendar year,,I would have said,,"Nah. No way.",What's even more exciting,is that if we can preventnfive months of lost time,just by redesigning two months,,imagine the possibilitiesnthat we can unlock,by tackling the rest of the calendar year. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)We humans are becoming an urban species,,so cities, they are our natural habitat.,That is where we live.,In 2014, over 54 percent,of the world population,was living in cities,,and I can bet you,that so many of these people have thought,of how they would do things differently,,like if I only had the tools,to change things in my city,,what would I do?,What would my dream city be like?,And these tools,,this is just what we gave them.,Two years ago, my team and I,,we released a game,,"Cities: Skylines.",It is a game about building cities. 
 So I have always beenninterested in cities as systems.,It's something that I findnimmensely interesting.,But what I didn't understand,was that I am not alone in this.,People love cities.,They are interested. They have ideas.,The game was an instant hit.,So far, over three and a halfnmillion people have played it. 
 And it's not just about playing.,We also have really awesomensharing systems.,So people play, they create cities,and then they are sharing these creations,,showing off what they have made.,And what I will show you,is some of these cities,created by the players. 
 So the game is about self-expression,,creativity,,not just overcoming the challengesnposed by the simulation.,It is about showingnwhat your cities look like. 
 So I have a couple of videos.,These are from YouTube.,And these are some of the mostninteresting city designs I have seen.,So they are all different,,and I hope you like all of these. 
 This one is called The Netherlands.,It's by Silvarret.,And when you start the game,,you have an empty piece of land.,This land, it can be basednon the real world,,it can be hand-crafted in the map editor,,or you can, of course, downloadna city made by someone else,and play in that.,But what Silvarret has done here,is that what he wanted to make,was not a real city.,This is a fantasy city,,even though it looks real.,So what he wanted to do was a fantasy citynthat could be in the Netherlands.,So he kind of investigated,what are the characteristicsnof cities in the Netherlands,and combined a couple of those,,and this is what he created.,So it is a city,,but it is not a real city,,but it could be.,It looks just like the Netherlands.,So the places are reallyndensely populated.,So what you need is highways, trains,,anything connectingnthese small town centers together.,Lots of people, lots of moving,,so transportation is the key here. 
 But then let's go even morenon the fantasy side.,Let's go into the future.,This is one of my personal favorites.,These city designsnare what I love the most.,So this is a tiered city by Conflictnerd,,and the basic idea isnthat you have concentric circle routes.,So the city is a big circle,with tinier circles inside.,And the thing is that you putnall of the services in the center,,and then people actually livenon the outer ring,,because there is less traffic,nless noise, less pollution,,so that is where you want to live.,But the servicesnare still really close by.,They are in the center.,And this is the soul of the game.,The player has to understand,what are the wishes, what are the needs,of the tiny people living in the cities.,So you need to knownwhere you should put the things.,Like, it's not enough to have a hospital.,It needs to be accessible.,Citizens need to reach the hospital.,And this is one way to do it.,So maybe this is somethingnthat we might be seeing someday. 
 And then even more into the future.,Astergea by Yuttho.,So Yuttho does YouTube videosnand plays the game.,What he did herenwas actually a 12-point series,of creating this city.,So what he does is he plays the game,,he records it,and he explains as he's goingnwhat he's doing and why.,And as a part of this series,,he actually did an interviewnwith an actual urban planner,called Jeff Speck.,And Speck is an expertnon the concept of walkability.,The basic idea is thatnif you want your citizens to walk,,which is kind of beneficial,,you actually need to have walkingnas a reasonable means of transportation.,It should be a good way to reach places.,So what Yuttho didnwas that he explained this concept,,he had Speck explain it, too,,and then he applied itnto the city that he was building.,So what we are seeingnis Yuttho's vision of the future:,lots of public transportation,nwalkways, plazas,,connecting high-rise buildings.,Maybe this is whatnthe future might look like.,And the game systemnworks really well for this. 
 We are seeing somenreal-world uses to this game.,So we know that some urban plannersnare using it as a sketching tool,,so while the simulationnis not completely realistic,,it is realistic enoughnthat if something works in the game,,it is highly likely that itnwill also work in the real world,,so that you can actually try out things,,see if this intersectionnmight fit this kind of a situation.,If we build a new road, would it help?,And this is what you can donwith this game. 
 There was one reallyninteresting contest held,by the Finnish city of Hämeenlinna.,So what they didnwas that they had a new area,that they wanted to develop in the city.,They made a map with the existing city,,they left empty the areanthat they would want to develop,and shared this map.,So anyone could download the map,,play the game, build the area,and submit their creationsnto the city council.,So they have not yet built anything,,but it might just benthat they use one of these plans,made with the game,to actually build the real city. 
 And these videos that I have shown you,,these are the people who arencoming up with new kinds of solutions.,We know that cities are growing.,They're getting bigger as we go,,and the percentage of populationnliving in cities is projected to rise.,So we need the solutions,and these people, playing the game,,they are trying outndifferent kinds of solutions.,They might have somethingnthat is really important.,So what we are seeing here is dream citiesnthat might be real one day.,So it might be,that this is not just a game.,It might be a way,to decide our own fate. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I am a climate scientist,,and I hate weather.,I have spent too much time in California,,and I strongly feel that weathernshould be optional. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I don't want to experience clouds,,let alone study them.,But clouds seem to follow menwherever I go. 
 The thing is, clouds are a realnchallenge for climate science.,We don't know how they're going to reactnas the planet heats up,,and hidden in that uncertainty,might be hope.,Maybe, just maybe,,clouds could slow down global warming,,and buy us a little bit more timento get our act together,,which would be very convenient right now.,I mean, even I could put upnwith a few more cloudy days,if clouds saved the planet. 
 Now, we are sure about some things.,Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas,,we're emitting a lot of it,,and the planet is heating up.,Case closed.,But I still go to work every day.,It turns out that there is a lotnthat we don't understand,about climate change.,In particular, we haven't answered,what seems to be a verynfundamental question.,We know it's going to get hot,,but we don't know exactlynhow hot it's going to get.,Now, this is a reallyneasy question to answer,if one of you would likento give me a time machine.,But I'm going to be honest with you:,if I had a time machine,,I would not be hanging outnat this particular point in history.,So in order to see the future,,we have to rely on the outputnof computer simulations --,climate models, like this one. 
 Now, in my line of work,,I encounter many very charmingnpeople on the internet,who like to tell menthat climate models are all wrong.,And I would just like to say:,no kidding!,Seriously? I get paid to complainnabout climate models.,But we don't want models to be perfect.,We want them to be useful.,I mean, think about it:,a computer simulation,that's able to exactlynreproduce all of reality.,That's not a climate model;,That's "The Matrix.",So, models are not crystal balls.,They're research tools,,and the ways in which they're wrongncan actually teach us a lot. 
 For example:,different climate modelsnare largely able to capture,the warming that we've seen so far.,But fast-forward to the end of the century,under a business-as-usual scenario,,and climate modelsndon't really agree anymore.,Yeah, they're all warming;nthat's just basic physics.,But some of them project catastrophe --,more than five times the warmingnwe've seen already.,And others are literally more chill. 
 So why don't climate models agreenon how warm it's going to get?,Well, to a large extent,,it's because they don't agreenon what clouds will do in the future.,And that is because, just like me,,computers hate clouds.,Computers hate clouds becausenthey're simultaneously very large,and very small.,Clouds are formed,when microscopic water dropletsnor ice crystals coalesce,around tiny particles.,But at the same time, they coverntwo-thirds of the earth's surface.,In order to reallynaccurately model clouds,,we'd need to track the behaviornof every water droplet and dust grain,in the entire atmosphere,,and there's no computernpowerful enough to do that.,So instead, we have to make a trade-off:,we can zoom in and get the details right,,but have no ideanwhat's going on worldwide;,or, we could sacrificenrealism at small scales,in order to see the bigger picture.,Now, there's no one right answer,,no perfect way to do this,,and different climate modelsnmake different choices. 
 Now, it is unfortunate,that computers struggle with clouds,,because clouds are crucially important,in regulating the temperaturenof the planet.,In fact, if all the clouds went away,,we would experiencenprofound climate changes.,But without clouds,,would it be warmer or colder?,The answer is both. 
 So I'm going to be honest with you,nI am not a cloud spotter.,My favorite type of cloud is none.,But even I know that cloudsncome in all shapes and sizes.,Low, thick clouds like thesenare really good at blocking out the sun,and ruining your barbecue,,and high, wispy clouds like these cirrus,largely let that sunlight stream through.,Every sunny day is the same,,but every cloudy daynis cloudy in its own way.,And it's this diversity,that can make the global impact of cloudsnvery hard to understand.,So to see this global effect of clouds,,it really helps to take a selfie. 
 It will never cease to blow my mind,that we can see our planetnfrom outer space,,but we can't see all of it.,Clouds are blocking the view.,That's what they do.,These low, thick cloudsnare extremely effective sunshades.,They turn back about 20 percentnof everything the sun sends us.,That is a lot of wasted solar power.,So, low clouds are powerful sunshades,,making the planet cooler.,But that's not the only effect of clouds.,Our planet has a temperature,,and like anything with a temperature,,it's giving off heat.,We are radiating thermal energynaway into space,,and we can see this in the infrared.,Once again, clouds are blocking the view.,That's because high clouds livenin the upper reaches of the atmosphere,,where it's very cold.,And this means that they losenvery little heat to space themselves.,But at the same time, they blocknthe heat coming up from the planet below.,The earth is trying to cool itself off,,and high clouds are getting in the way.,The result is a verynpowerful greenhouse effect.,So, clouds play this verynlarge and dual role,in the climate system.,We've got low clouds that actnlike a sunshade,,cooling the planet,,and high clouds which actnlike a greenhouse,,warming the planet. 
 Right now, these two effects --nthey don't cancel out.,That sunshade -- it's a littlenbit more powerful.,So if we got ridnof all the clouds tomorrow,,which, for the record,nI am not advocating,,our planet would get warmer.,So clearly, all of the cloudsnare not going away.,But climate change is change.,So we can ask:,How will global warming change clouds?,But remember, clouds are so important,in regulating the earth's temperature,,and they both warm and cool the planet.,So even small changes to cloud cover,could have profound consequences.,So we might also ask:,How will clouds change global warming? 
 And that is where there mightnbe space for hope.,If global warming triggers cloud changes,that make for a less powerful greenhousenor a more effective sunshade,,then that would enhancenthe cooling power of clouds.,It would act in oppositionnto global warming,,and that's what's happeningnin those climate models,that project relatively muted warming.,But climate models struggle with clouds,,and this uncertainty -- it goes both ways.,Clouds could help us outnwith global warming.,They could also make it worse. 
 Now, we know thatnclimate change is happening,because we can see it:,rising temperatures, melting icecaps,nshifts in rainfall patterns.,And you might think that wencould also see it in the clouds.,But here's something else unfortunate:,clouds are really hard to see.,I see everybody from the Pacific Northwest,is like, "I have somensuggestions for you." 
 (Laughter) 
 And you guys, we have tried looking up. 
 (Laughter) 
 But in order to do climate science,,we need to see all of the clouds,neverywhere, for a very long time.,And that's what makes it hard.,Now, nothing sees more cloudsnthan a satellite --,not even a British person. 
 (Laughter) 
 And fortunately, we do havensatellite observations of clouds,that, like me, date back to the 1980s.,But these satellitesnwere designed for weather,,not climate.,They weren't in it for the long haul.,So to get that long-termntrend information,,we need to do climate science.,We have to stitch togethernthe output of multiple satellites,with different viewing angles and orbits,and carrying different camera equipment.,And as a result,,there are gaps in our knowledge.,But even from this very cloudy picture,,we're starting to get hintsnof a possible future. 
 When we looked at the observations,,one thing jumped out at us:,the clouds are moving.,As the planet's temperature increases,,high clouds rise up.,They move to the coldernupper reaches of the atmosphere,,and this means that evennas the planet heats up,,high clouds don't.,They remain at roughlynthe same temperature.,So they are not losing more heat to space.,But at the same time,nthey're trapping more heat,from the warming planet below.,This intensifies the greenhouse effect.,High clouds are makingnglobal warming worse. 
 Clouds are movingnin other dimensions, too.,The atmospheric circulation,nthat large-scale motion,of air and water in the atmosphere,,is changing,,and clouds are going with it.,On large scales,,clouds seem to be movingnfrom the tropics toward the poles.,It's kind of like yourngrandparents in reverse.,And this matters,,because if your jobnis to block incoming sunlight,,you are going to be muchnmore effective in the tropics,under that intense tropical sun,than you are in higher latitudes.,So if this keeps up,,this will also make global warming worse.,And what we have not found,,despite years of looking,,is any indication of the opposite.,There is no observational evidence,that clouds will substantiallynslow down global warming.,The earth is not goingnto break its own fever. 
 Now, there are still uncertainties here.,We don't know for sure,what the future holds.,But we are sending our kids there,,and they are never coming back.,I want them to be preparednfor what they'll face,,and that is why it is so important,to keep our earth-observingnsatellites up there,and to hire diverse and smartnand talented people,who do not hate clouds,to improve the climate models. 
 But uncertainty is not ignorance.,We don't know everything,,but we don't know nothing,,and we know what carbon dioxide does.,I started my career as an astrophysicist,,so you can believe me,when I say that this is the greatestnplace in the universe.,Other planets might have liquid water.,On earth, we have whiskey. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 We are so lucky to live here,,but let's not push our luck.,I don't think that cloudsnwill save the planet.,I think that's probably up to us. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)The first time I cried underwater,was in 2008,,the island of Curaçao,,way down in the southern Caribbean.,It's beautiful there.,I was studying these corals for my PhD,,and after days and daysnof diving on the same reef,,I had gotten to know them as individuals.,I had made friends with coral colonies --,totally a normal thing to do.,Then, Hurricane Omar smashed them apartnand ripped off their skin,,leaving little bits of wounded tissuenthat would have a hard time healing,,and big patches of dead skeletonnthat would get overgrown by algae.,When I saw this damage for the first time,,stretching all the way down the reef,,I sunk onto the sand in my scuba gear,and I cried.,If a coral could die that fast,,how could a reef ever survive?,And why was I making it my jobnto try to fight for them? 
 I never heard another scientistntell that kind of story,until last year.,A scientist in Guam wrote,,"I cried right into my mask,",seeing the damage on the reefs.,Then a scientist in Australia wrote,,"I showed my studentsnthe results of our coral surveys,,and we wept.",Crying about coralsnis having a moment, guys. 
 (Laughter) 
 And that's because reefs in the Pacific,are losing corals fasternthan we've ever seen before.,Because of climate change,,the water is so hot for so longnin the summers,,that these animalsncan't function normally.,They're spitting out the colored algaenthat lives in their skin,,and the clear bleached tissuenthat's left usually starves to death,and then rots away.,Then the skeletons are overgrown by algae. 
 This is happeningnover an unbelievable scale.,The Northern Great Barrier Reefnlost two-thirds of its corals last year,over a distance of hundreds of miles,,then bleached again this year,,and the bleaching stretched further south.,Reefs in the Pacificnare in a nosedive right now,,and no one knowsnhow bad it's going to get,,except ...,over in the Caribbean where I work,,we've already been through the nosedive.,Reefs there have sufferednthrough centuries of intense human abuse.,We kind of already knownhow the story goes.,And we might be able to help predictnwhat happens next. 
 Let's consult a graph.,Since the invention of scuba,,scientists have measurednthe amount of coral on the seafloor,,and how it's changed through time.,And after centuriesnof ratcheting human pressure,,Caribbean reefs met one of three fates.,Some reefs lost their corals very quickly.,Some reefs lost their corals more slowly,,but kind of ended up in the same place.,OK, so far this is not going very well.,But some reefs in the Caribbean --,the ones best protected,and the ones a littlenfurther from humans --,they managed to hold onto their corals.,Give us a challenge.,And, we almost never saw a reef hit zero. 
 The second time I cried underwater,was on the north shore of Curaçao, 2011.,It was the calmest day of the year,,but it's always prettynsketchy diving there.,My boyfriend and I swam against the waves.,I watched my compassnso we could find our way back out,,and he watched for sharks,,and after 20 minutes of swimmingnthat felt like an hour,,we finally dropped down to the reef,,and I was so shocked,,and I was so happy,that my eyes filled with tears.,There were corals 1,000 years oldnlined up one after another.,They had survived the entire historynof European colonialism in the Caribbean,,and for centuries before that. 
 I never knew what a coral could donwhen it was given a chance to thrive.,The truth is that evennas we lose so many corals,,even as we go throughnthis massive coral die-off,,some reefs will survive.,Some will be ragged on the edge,,some will be beautiful.,And by protecting shorelinesnand giving us food to eat,and supporting tourism,,they will still be worthnbillions and billions of dollars a year.,The best time to protect a reefnwas 50 years ago,,but the second-best time is right now.,Even as we go through bleaching events,,more frequent and in more places,,some corals will be able to recover. 
 We had a bleaching eventnin 2010 in the Caribbean,that took off big patches of skinnon boulder corals like these.,This coral lost half of its skin.,But if you look at the sidenof this coral a few years later,,this coral is actually healthy again.,It's doing what a healthy coral does.,It's making copies of its polyps,,it's fighting back the algae,and it's reclaiming its territory.,If a few polyps survive,,a coral can regrow;,it just needs time and protectionnand a reasonable temperature.,Some corals can regrow in 10 years --,others take a lot longer.,But the more stressesnwe take off them locally --,things like overfishing,nsewage pollution, fertilizer pollution,,dredging, coastal construction --,the better they can hang onnas we stabilize the climate,,and the faster they can regrow. 
 And as we go through the long,ntough and necessary process,of stabilizing the climatenof planet Earth,,some new corals will still be born.,This is what I study in my research.,We try to understandnhow corals make babies,,and how those babiesnfind their way to the reef,,and we invent new methodsnto help them survive,those early, fragile life stages.,One of my favoritencoral babies of all time,showed up right after Hurricane Omar.,It's the same speciesnI was studying before the storm,,but you almost never seenbabies of this species --,it's really rare.,This is actually an endangered species.,In this photo, this little baby coral,nthis little circle of polyps,,is a few years old.,Like its cousins that bleach,,it's fighting back the algae.,And like its cousins on the north shore,,it's aiming to live for 1,000 years. 
 What's happening in the worldnand in the ocean,has changed our time horizon.,We can be incredibly pessimisticnon the short term,,and mourn what we lost,and what we really took for granted.,But we can still be optimisticnon the long term,,and we can still be ambitiousnabout what we fight for,and what we expect from our governments,,from our planet.,Corals have been living on planet Earthnfor hundreds of millions of years.,They survived the extinctionnof the dinosaurs.,They're badasses. 
 (Laughter) 
 An individual coral can go throughntremendous trauma and fully recover,if it's given a chancenand it's given protection.,Corals have alwaysnbeen playing the long game,,and now so are we. 
 Thanks very much. 
 (Applause)When was I was 21 years old,,I had all this physics homework.,Physics homework requires taking breaks,,and Wikipedia was relatively new,nso I took a lot of breaks there.,I kept going back to the same articles,,reading them again and again,,on glaciers, Antarctica and Greenland.,How cool would it be to visit these places,and what would it take to do so?,Well, here we are,on a repurposed Air Force cargo plane,operated by NASA,flying over the Greenland ice sheet.,There's a lot to see here,,but there's more that is hidden,,waiting to be uncovered.,What the Wikipedia articles didn't tell me,is that there's liquid waternhidden inside the ice sheet,,because we didn't know that yet. 
 I did learn on Wikipedianthat the Greenland ice sheet is huge,,the size of Mexico,,and its ice from top to bottomnis two miles thick.,But it's not just static.,The ice flows like a riverndownhill towards the ocean.,As it flows around bends,,it deforms and cracks. 
 I get to study these amazing ice dynamics,,which are located in one of the mostnremote physical environments,remaining on earth.,To work in glaciology right nownis like getting in on the ground floor,at Facebook in the 2000s. 
 (Laughter) 
 Our capability to fly airplanesnand satellites over the ice sheets,is revolutionizing glaciology.,It's just starting to do for science,what the smartphonenhas done for social media. 
 The satellites are reportingna wealth of observations,that are revealing new hidden factsnabout the ice sheets continuously.,For instance, we have observationsnof the size of the Greenland ice sheet,every month going back to 2002.,You can look towards the bottomnof the screen here,to see the month and the year go forward.,You can see that some areasnof the ice sheet melt,or lose ice in the summer.,Other areas experience snowfall,or gain ice back in the winter.,This seasonal cycle, though, is eclipsednby an overall rate of mass loss,that would have stunnedna glaciologist 50 years ago.,We never thought that an ice sheet couldnlose mass into the ocean this quickly.,Since these measurements began in 2002,,the ice sheet has lost so much ice,that if that water were piled upnon our smallest continent,,it would drown Australia knee-deep.,How is this possible?,Well, under the ice lies the bedrock.,We used radar to image the hills,nvalleys, mountains and depressions,that the ice flows over.,Hidden under the ice sheet are channelsnthe size of the Grand Canyon,that funnel ice and waternoff of Greenland and into the ocean. 
 The reason that radarncan reveal the bedrock,is that ice is entirelyntransparent to radar.,You can do an experiment.,Go home and putnan ice cube in the microwave.,It won't melt,,because microwaves, or radar,,pass straight through the icenwithout interacting.,If you want to melt your ice cube,nyou have to get it wet,,because water heats up easilynin the microwave.,That's the whole principlenthe microwave oven is designed around.,Radar can see water.,And radar has revealedna vast pool of liquid water,hidden under my colleague Olivia,,seven stories beneath her feet.,Here, she's used a pump,to bring some of that waternback to the ice sheet's surface. 
 Just six years ago, we had no ideanthis glacier aquifer existed.,The aquifer formed,when snow melts in the summer sun,and trickles downward.,It puddles up in huge pools.,From there, the snow acts as an igloo,,insulating this waternfrom the cold and the wind above.,So the water can staynhidden in the ice sheet,in liquid form year after year.,The question is, what happens next?,Does the water stay there forever?,It could.,Or does it find a way outnto reach the global ocean?,One possible waynfor the water to reach the bedrock,and from there the ocean,is a crevasse, or a crack in the ice.,When cracks fill with water,,the weight of the waternforces them deeper and deeper.,This is how fracking works,to extract natural gasnfrom deep within the earth.,Pressurized fluids fracture rocks.,All it takes is a crack to get started. 
 Well, we recently discovered,that there are cracks availablenin the Greenland ice sheet,near this glacier aquifer.,You can fly overnmost of the Greenland ice sheet,and see nothing,,no cracks, no features on the surface,,but as this helicopternflies towards the coast,,the path that water would takenon its quest to flow downhill,,one crack appears,,then another and another.,Are these cracks filled with liquid water?,And if so, how deepndo they take that water?,Can they take it to the bedrock,and the ocean?,To answer these questions,,we need somethingnbeyond remote sensing data.,We need numeric models. 
 I write numeric modelsnthat run on supercomputers.,A numeric modelnis simply a set of equations,that works together to describe something.,It can be as simplenas the next number in a sequence --,one, three, five, seven --,or it can be a more complexnset of equations,that predict the future,based on known conditions in the present.,In our case, what arenthe equations for how ice cracks?,Well, engineers already havena very good understanding,of how aluminum, steel and plasticsnfracture under stress.,It's an important problem in our society.,And it turns outnthat the engineering equations,for how materials fracture,are not that differentnfrom my physics homework.,So I borrowed them, adapted them for ice,,and then I had a numeric modelnfor how a crevasse can fracture,when filled with water from the aquifer.,This is the power of math.,It can help us understandnreal processes in our world. 
 I'll show you nownthe results of my numeric model,,but first I should point out,that the crevasse is aboutna thousand times narrower than it is deep,,so in the main panel here,,we've zoomed in to better see the details.,You can look to the smallernpanel on the right,to see the true scalenfor how tall and skinny the crevasse is. 
 As the aquifer waternflows into the crevasse,,some of it refreezesnin the negative 15 degree Celsius ice.,That's about as coldnas your kitchen freezer.,But this loss can be overcome,if the flow rate in fromnthe glacier aquifer is high enough.,In our case, it is,,and the aquifer water drives the crevassenall the way to the base of the ice sheet,a thousand meters below.,From there, it has a clear pathnto reach the ocean.,So the aquifer water is a part,of the three millimetersnper year of sea level rise,that we experience as a global society. 
 But there's more:,the aquifer waternmight be punching above its weight.,The ice flows in complex ways.,In some places, the ice flows very fast.,There tends to be waternat the base of the ice sheet here.,In other places, not so fast.,Usually, there's not waternpresent at the base there. 
 Now that we know the aquifer waternis getting to the base of the ice sheet,,the next question is:,Is it making the ice itselfnflow faster into the ocean?,We're trying to uncover these mysteriesnhidden inside the Greenland ice sheet,so that we can better plannfor the sea level rise it holds.,The amount of icenthat Greenland has lost since 2002,is just a small fractionnof what that ice sheet holds. 
 Ice sheets are immense, powerful machinesnthat operate on long timescales.,In the next 80 years, global sea levelsnwill rise at least 20 centimeters,,perhaps as much as one meter,,and maybe more.,Our understandingnof future sea level rise is good,,but our projections have a wide range.,It's our role as glaciologistsnand scientists,to narrow these uncertainties. 
 How much sea level rise is coming,,and how fast will it get here?,We need to know how much and how fast,,so the world and its communities cannplan for the sea level rise that's coming. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)[Yoruba: Freeborn Ijebu-Ode son,],[of true Ogbogbo Clan,],[whose wealth and resourcesnsurpass all that Europe ever had,],[whose altar is filled with gold.] 
 This chant is called the oríkì.,My grandmother used to sing itnto me when I was a child in Nigeria.,See, an oríkì is the song of praisenof the Yoruba people,,and this particularly speaksnof treasures that the West does not have. 
 Mama -- that's whatnI call my grandmother --,told me many storiesnabout Yoruba mythology.,You see, the Yorubas are an ethnic groupnfrom the southwestern part of Nigeria,,and I was always fascinatednby these stories.,I was always intrigued.,And Yoruba culture has inspirednmy art since I was a child.,You see, African art is not just whatnyou buy at Harlem markets in New York.,Every artist has a name,,and every artist has a story.,This is my story. 
 See, mama had tattoosnon her arms and her legs.,As a child, I thoughtnshe was born with them,,with beautiful black linesnand detailed symbols.,And then she told me,that they were actually symbolsnfrom the Yoruba mythology.,I never knew how this was goingnto influence the artist that I am today.,You see, as a young child,nI saw art everywhere.,I remember the house we lived innin Ilorin, in Stadium Road.,We had marble floors,,and you know, I would looknat the marble floors,,and I would see all sortsnof patterns and designs in it,,and I thought everybody could see them.,So I would call my brother,nand I would be like,,"Ikeolu, come and see this marble design,nsee this pattern, see this mask.",And he would tell me,n"Laolu, I don't see anything.",So I would use ink, and I would trace outnwhat I saw on the floor.,And then when my mom noticed,nshe got really upset. 
 (Laughter) 
 But that didn't stop me.,I switched from ink to chalk,,because I got in trouble a lotnwith my teachers and my parents.,So I remember my mom said,n"Laolu, we are Christians.,Why don't you draw like other people?,Why don't you draw landscapesnor maybe you draw chairs or furniture,,or maybe even draw Jesus?" 
 You know, I could paintnthe whole house if I had a chance,,but when I grew up,nI knew being an artist was not an option,,so I wanted to be the personnmy parents wanted me to be,,so I went to law school.,Of course, that's my dad there.nHe was so proud that day.,And this was what my notebooksnlooked like in law school. 
 (Laughter) 
 Of course I would miss classes,,and I would make up excusesnwhy I wasn't going to class. 
 But when I started workingnat the Human Rights Commission,as a human rights attorney,,my mind was elsewhere.,I saw a very tough reality.,I worked with children,who had to choosenbetween getting an education,and actually being forced into marriage.,I was so frustratednseeing all the injustice around me,,and my only outlet was art,,so I started painting. 
 This piece is called "Dreamscape.",So when you zoom into this piece,,you're going to see a girl child,and the accidental birth,,the fact that our futurenis controlled by where we are born.,Now, the next one you seena man and a man holding hands,,a woman and a woman holding hands.,You see, in Nigeria,nsame-sex relationship is criminalized.,You can actually get 14 years for that. 
 With my art, I like to tell stories.,Through my art,nI like to start a conversation.,So in this one, you see the map of Africa,,you see the questions, you see crying,,and there you see syringesnplugged into Africa,and the natural resourcesnbeing drained out.,So I asked myself, where does it go?,Who benefits from all of this?,You see, with my art,,the way I weave my art aroundnthe patterns, the masks, the stories,,and the way I use my lines,,it's all from the Yoruba culture. 
 So in 2013, I made a big gamble.,I quit my job and I moved to New York Citynto practice art full time.,Of course, my parents were like,,"Oh, [it's just a phase.]nHe'll come back.",But life as an artistnin New York was not easy,,because I was broke,,no money, no gallery agents,nno representation,,so no gallery would show my work.,So I thought to myself, I need to survive.,So I started painting on clothesnto make a living.,I started painting on shoes.,I started customizing things for people.,And then soon I realized the power,,because people were so proudnto wear their stories.,So I started painting on everything.,I painted on guitars,,I started doing murals,,anything I could findnmy hand on I painted,,and everything became my canvas. 
 So one day, I was just goingnon my Instagram feed,,and I saw this picture.,It was Reign. She took a picturenstanding in front my art,,and the moment I saw that photo,,something happened in that moment.,I could actually see my artworkngo into her and come out of her literally,,and that's how I started paintingnon human bodies.,As a child I saw art on the marble floors,,I saw art on walls,,but now I see art on people's facesnand people's bodies.,I remember my grandmother,,and I realized thatnmost of my creative instincts,were actually basednon my childhood memories,and the art on my grandmother's skin. 
 Now I look at all the people I painted,nand I think to myself, like,,what would it look likenif we all walked around,like gods and goddessesnfrom Yoruba mythology?,And boom, that's hownThe Sacred Art of the Ori was born.,You see, Ori in Yoruba mythology,means your soul, it means your essence,nit means your instincts.,And I realized that onlynwhen you tap into your Ori,,then you can actually move mountains.,So there's something so immediatenabout painting on human bodies.,It's like art in motion.,It's like a 3D experience. 
 So one day, I was just doingnmy regular work in Brooklyn,,and I got an email that said,,"Hi, I'm a big fan of your work.,Would you like to paintnfor my music video?,Signed, Beyoncé.",Like, Beyoncé emailed me.,I was like, what? 
 (Laughter) 
 I was like, what,nhow did she even know me?,I thought this can't be true.nOf course I thought it was a scam.,The Nigerian in me was like, nah. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 But incredibly enough,nit was real, it was true,,and things happened really fast.,You see, Beyoncé wantednto pay homage to New Orleans,,and my art reminded hernof her creole origins.,So when "Lemonade" dropped, of course,,boom, everything just wentnfrom zero to 100 real fast.,People featured me in magazines,,interviews.,People stopped me in the street.,People knew my name, like --,And sometimes I had to step back,and just chill,nand, like, take everything in.,You know, as artists,nwe work so hard all our lives,for our art to be recognized,,and for this I feel blessed.,However, the attorneynin me is still there,,so I use my artnto fight for what I believe in.,My Yoruba heritage is always there. 
 I'd like to share with you tonightnsome of my art in motion.,Please, welcome with me on stage. 
 (Music) 
 (Applause) 
 Now, this is Geli, and this is Reign.,These are the first two peoplenI ever painted in my life,,and I spent the past day painting on them.,Tonight, they representnmy hopes and my fears.,Now, I put my fears on the back.,I put my hopes in front.,What are my hopes?,I hope that people know,that Africa is not justnone huge, nameless continent,that is all the same.,I also hope that people know,that in Nigeria, we havenover 350 ethnic groups and languages,,and I am just one artist from one of them. 
 (Applause) 
 I also hope that you knownthat I hope I will be able to change,the way people talk about African artnon the continent and here,,and I hope you know that African art,is not just what you buynat Harlem markets in New York,and that every piece of artnyou see has a story,,and every artist has a name. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Let's say you despise,Western democracy.,Democracy, in all its trappings,,free elections, town halls,,endless debates aboutnthe proper role of government.,Too messy,,too unpredictable,,too constraining for your taste.,And the way these democraciesnband together and lecture everyone else,about individual rights and freedoms --,it gets under your skin. 
 So what to do about it?,You can call out the hypocrisynand failures of Western democracies,and explain how your way is better,,but that's never really worked for you.,What if you could get the people,whose support is the very foundationnof these democracies,to start questioning the system?,Make the idea occur in their own minds,that democracy and its institutionsnare failing them,,their elite are corrupt puppet masters,and the country they knew is in free fall.,To do that,,you'll need to infiltratenthe information spheres,of these democracies.,You'll need to turnntheir most powerful asset --,an open mind --,into their greatest vulnerability.,You'll need people to question the truth. 
 Now, you'll be familiar of hackingnand leaks that happened in 2016.,One was the DemocraticnNational Committee's networks,,and the personal emailnaccounts of its staff,,later released on WikiLeaks.,After that, various online personas,,like a supposed Romanian cybercriminalnwho didn't speak Romanian,,aggressively pushed newsnof these leaks to journalists.,The media took the bait.,They were consumed by how muchnthe DNC hated Bernie.,At the time, it was that narrativenthat far outshined the news,that a group of Russian governmentnsponsored hackers,who we called "AdvancednPersistent Threat 28,",or "APT28" for short,,was carrying outnthese operations against the US. 
 And there was no shortage of evidence.,This group of Russian government hackersnhadn't just appeared out of nowhere,in 2016.,We had started trackingnthis group back in 2014.,And the tools that APT28 usednto compromise its victims' networks,demonstrated a thoughtful,nwell-resourced effort,that had taken place for now over a decade,in Moscow's time zone,from about 9 am to 6 pm.,APT28 loved to prey on the emailsnand contacts of journalists in Chechnya,,the Georgian government,neastern European defense attachés --,all targets with an undeniable interestnto the Russian government. 
 We weren't the only ones onto this.,Governments, research teamsnacross the world,,were coming to similar conclusions,and observing the samentypes of operations.,But what Russia was doing in 2016,went far beyond espionage.,The DNC hack was just one of manynwhere stolen data was posted online,accompanied by a sensational narrative,,then amplified in social media,for lightning-speed adoption by the media.,This didn't ring the alarm bells,that a nation-state was tryingnto interfere with the credibility,of another's internal affairs. 
 So why, collectively,ndid we not see this coming?,Why did it take monthsnbefore Americans understood,that they were under a state-sponsoredninformation attack?,The easy answer is politics.,The Obama Administration was caughtnin a perfect catch-22.,By raising the specter that the Russianngovernment was interfering,in the US presidential campaign,,the Administration risked appearingnto meddle in the campaign itself.,But the better answer, I think,,is that the US and the Westnwere utterly unequipped,to recognize and respondnto a modern information operation,,despite the fact that the USnhad wielded information,with devastating successnin an era not so long ago. 
 Look, so while the US and the Westnspent the last 20 years,caught up in cybersecurity --,what networks to harden,,which infrastructure to deem critical,,how to set up armies of cyber warriorsnand cyber commands --,Russia was thinking in far morenconsequential terms.,Before the first iPhoneneven hit the shelf,,the Russian government understoodnthe risks and the opportunity,that technology provided,and the inter-communicationnand instant communication it provided us. 
 As our realities are increasinglynbased on the information,that we're consumingnat the palm of our hand,and from the news feedsnthat we're scanning,and the hashtags and storiesnthat we see trending,,the Russian governmentnwas the first to recognize,how this evolution,had turned your mind into the mostnexploitable device on the planet.,And your mind is particularly exploitable,if you're accustomednto an unfettered flow of information,,now increasingly curatednto your own tastes.,This panorama of informationnthat's so interesting to you,gives a state, or anyone for that matter,na perfect back door into your mind. 
 It's this new brand of state-sponsoredninformation operations,that can be that much more successful,,more insidious,,and harder for the target audience --nthat includes the media --,to decipher and characterize.,If you can get a hashtagntrending on Twitter,,or chum the waters with fake news,directed to audiencesnprimed to receive it,,or drive journalists to dissectnterabytes of email,for a cent of impropriety --,all tactics used in Russian operations --,then you've got a shot at effectivelyncamouflaging your operations,in the mind of your target.,This is what Russia's long calledn"reflexive control.",It's the ability to useninformation on someone else,so that they make a decision,on their own accord,that's favorable to you.,This is nation-state-grade image controlnand perception management,,and it's conducted by any means,,with any tools, network-basednor otherwise, that will achieve it. 
 Take this for another example.,In early February 2014, a few weeksnbefore Russia would invade Crimea,,a phone call is posted on YouTube.,In it, there's two US diplomats.,They sound like they're playingnkingmaker in Ukraine,,and worse, they curse the EUnfor its lack of speed and leadership,in resolving the crisis.,The media covers the phone call,,and then the ensuing diplomatic backlash,leaves Washington and Europe reeling.,And it creates a fissured responsenand a feckless attitude,towards Russia's land grab in Ukraine.,Mission accomplished. 
 So while hacked phone callsnand emails and networks,keep grabbing the headlines,,the real operations are the ones,that are influencingnthe decisions you make,and the opinions you hold,,all in the service of a nation-state'snstrategic interest.,This is power in the information age.,And this information is allnthat much more seductive,,all that much easier to takenat face value and pass on,,when it's authentic.,Who's not interested in the truthnthat's presented in phone calls and emails,that were never intendednfor public consumption?,But how meaningful is that truth,if you don't know whynit's being revealed to you? 
 We must recognize that this placenwhere we're increasingly living,,which we've quaintly termed "cyberspace,",isn't defined by ones and zeroes,,but by informationnand the people behind it.,This is far more than a networknof computers and devices.,This is a network composed of minds,interacting with computers and devices. 
 And for this network,,there's no encryption,nthere's no firewall,,no two-factor authentication,,no password complex enough to protect you.,What you have for defense,is far stronger, it's more adaptable,nit's always running the latest version.,It's the ability to think critically:,call out falsehood,,press for the facts.,And above all, you must have the courage,to unflinchingly pursue the truth. 
 (Applause)So, I had been a photographer,for 18 years,before I began the Microsculpture Project.,And in that time,nI had shot global ad campaigns,,I had the opportunity to photographnsome of my generation's icons,,and I was traveling the world.,I got to a point in my careernthat I dreamed of getting to,,and yet, for some reason,nI still felt a little bit unfulfilled.,Despite the extraordinary thingsnI was shooting and experiencing,,they'd started to feelna little bit ordinary to me.,I was also getting concerned,about how disposable photographynhad started to feel in the digital world,,and I really wanted to produce imagesnthat had a sense of worth again.,And I needed a subjectnthat felt extraordinary. 
 Sometimes I wishnI had the eyes of a child.,And by that I mean,nI wish I could look at the world,in the same as I didnwhen I was a small boy.,I think there is a danger,nas we get older,,that our curiosity becomesnslightly muted or dulled by familiarity.,And as a visual creator,none of the challenges for me,is to present the familiarnin a new and engaging way. 
 Fortunately for me, though,nI've got two great kids,who are still curious about the world.,Sebastian -- he's still curiousnabout the world, and in 2014, in spring,,he brought in a ground beetlenfrom the garden.,There was nothing particularly specialnabout this insect --,you know, it was a common species.,But he was still curious,,and he brought it up to my office,,and we decided to look at itnunder his microscope.,He had a little science kit for Christmas.,And this is what we saw. 
 Now, when I first saw this,nit blew me away.,Up here -- this is the backnof the ground beetle.,When I first saw it,nit reminded me of a galaxy.,And all the time, this had justnbeen outside our window.,You know, I was lookingnfor this extraordinary subject,,and it took Seb's eyes and curiositynto bring it in to me. 
 So I decided to photograph it for him,nand this is what I produced.,I basically asked myselfntwo simple questions.,The first one:,Could I take all my knowledge and skillnof photographic lighting,and take that onto a subjectnthat's five millimeters long?,But also: Could I keepncreative control over that lighting,on a subject that size?,So I practicednon some other found specimens,,and I approached the Oxford UniversitynMuseum of Natural History,to see if I could have accessnto their collection,,to progress the project.,And I went up there for a meeting,,and I showed them some of the imagesnthat I'd been shooting,,and they could seenthe kind of detail I was able to get.,I don't think they'd ever really seennanything quite like it before,,and from that point forward,nthey gave me open access,to their entire collection,and the assistance of Dr. James Hogan,ntheir entomologist. 
 Now, over the next two-and-a-half years,,I shot 37 insects from their collection.,And the way I work,is that I essentially split the insectnup into multiple sections,,and I treat each one of those sectionsnlike a small still life.,So for example, if I was photographingnthe eye of the insect,,which is normally quite smoothnand dome-shaped,,then I'd use a light sourcenthat is large and soft and diffuse,,so I don't get any harsh hot spotsnon that surface.,But once my attentionnturns over to a hairy leg,,that lighting setupnwill change completely.,And so I make that one tiny sectionnlook as beautiful as I possibly can,,and I work my way across the insect,until I have about 20 or 25ndifferent sections. 
 The issue with photographynat high magnification,is that there is inherentlyna very shallow depth of field.,So to get around that, what I do is,,I put my camera on a rail,that I can automatento move 10 microns in between each shot.,That's about one-seventh the widthnof a human hair.,And then that provides menwith a deep stack of images.,Each has a tiny sliver of focusnall the way through.,And I can squash that down,to produce one imagenthat is fully focused from front to back.,So essentially, that gives men25 sections that are fully focused,and beautifully lit.,Now, each one of my images,is made up of anywherenbetween 8- and 10,000 separate shots.,They take about three-and-a-halfnweeks to create,,and the file sizes on averagenare about four gigabytes.,So I've got plenty of informationnto play with when I'm printing.,And the prints at the exhibitionnare around the three-meter mark.,In fact, I had a shownin Milan two weeks ago,,and we had some prints therenthat were nine meters long. 
 But, you know, I realize,that these images still have to worknin the digital world.,There's no point in me puttingnall my blood, sweat and tears,into these pictures,if they're only going to be showingn500 pixels on a screen.,So with the help of Rob Chandlernand Will Cookson,,we developed a website,that enables the viewernto immerse themselves,into the full four-gigabyte files,,and they can explorenall that microscopic detail.,So if you have the time,nand I encourage you,,please visit microsculpture.net,and go and have a play.,It's good fun. 
 I first showed the work at Oxford,,and since then, it's moved onnto the Middle East.,It's now back in Europenand goes to Copenhagen this month.,And the feedback has been great.,You know, I get emails, actually,nfrom all over the world --,from teachers, at the moment,nwho are using the website in school.,The kids are using them on the tablet.,They're zooming into the pictures,and using it for art class, biology class.,And that's not something I planned.,That's just a beautiful offshootnof the project.,In fact, one of the thingsnI like to do at the exhibitions,is actually look atnthe kiddies' reactions.,And, you know, standingnin front of a three-meter insect,,they could have been horrified.,But they're not. They look in wonder.,This little chap here, he stood therenfor five minutes, motionless. 
 (Laughter) 
 And at the end of the day, actually,nat the end of the day at the exhibitions,,we have to wipe downnthe lower third of the big prints --,(Laughter),just to removenall those sticky handprints,,because all they want to donis touch those big bugs. 
 I do want to leave younwith one final image, if that's OK.,This has to do with Charles Darwin.,One of the recent imagesnthat I photographed,was this one here.,I'm talking about the creaturenin the box, not my cat.,And this is a shield bug,that Charles Darwinnbrought back from Australia,on the HMS Beagle in 1836.,And when I got it home,,I stood in my kitchennand stared at it for about 20 minutes.,I couldn't believe I was in possessionnof this beautiful creature.,And at that moment, I kind of realized,that this validated the project for me.,The fact that the museumnwas willing to risk me playing with this,kind of showed menthat my images had worth --,you know, they weren't disposable. 
 That's the image that I produced.,I often wonder, still,nwhen I look at this:,What would Charles Darwinnmake of these images?,Do you think he'd like his picturenof his shield bug? I hope so. 
 So -- 
 (Applause) 
 You know, I think it's strange in a way.,I'm a visual person,nI'm a creative person,,but I still needed the eyes of a childnto find my extraordinary subject.,That's the way it was.,So all I can say is,nthank you very much, Sebastian;,I am very, very grateful. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)How many people here would like to livento be at least 80 years old?,Yeah.,I think we all haventhis hopeful expectation,of living into old age.,Let's project out into the future,,to your future "you's,",and let's imagine that we're all 85.,Now, everyone look at two people.,One of you probably hasnAlzheimer's disease. 
 (Laughter) 
 Alright, alright.,And maybe you're thinking,n"Well, it won't be me.",Then, OK. You are a caregiver.,So -- 
 (Laughter) 
 so in some way,,this terrifying diseasenis likely to affect us all. 
 Part of the fear around Alzheimer'snstems from the sense,that there's nothing we can do about it.,Despite decades of research, we stillnhave no disease-modifying treatment,and no cure.,So if we're lucky enoughnto live long enough,,Alzheimer's appears to benour brain's destiny. 
 But maybe it doesn't have to be.,What if I told you we couldnchange these statistics,,literally change our brain's destiny,,without relying on a curenor advancements in medicine? 
 Let's begin by looking atnwhat we currently understand,about the neuroscience of Alzheimer's.,Here's a picturenof two neurons connecting.,The point of connection,nthis space circled in red,,is called the synapse.,The synapse is wherenneurotransmitters are released.,This is where signals are transmitted,nwhere communication happens.,This is where we think,nfeel, see, hear, desire ...,and remember.,And the synapsenis where Alzheimer's happens. 
 Let's zoom in on the synapse,and look at a cartoon representationnof what's going on.,During the businessnof communicating information,,in addition to releasing neurotransmittersnlike glutamate into the synapse,,neurons also release a small peptidencalled amyloid beta.,Normally, amyloid beta is cleared awaynmetabolized by microglia,,the janitor cells of our brains.,While the molecular causesnof Alzheimer's are still debated,,most neuroscientists believenthat the disease begins,when amyloid beta begins to accumulate.,Too much is released,nor not enough is cleared away,,and the synapse beginsnto pile up with amyloid beta.,And when this happens, it binds to itself,,forming sticky aggregatesncalled amyloid plaques. 
 How many people herenare 40 years old or older?,You're afraid to admit it now.,This initial step into the disease,,this presence of amyloidnplaques accumulating,,can already be found in your brains.,The only way we could be sure of thisnwould be through a PET scan,,because at this point,nyou are blissfully unaware.,You're not showing any impairmentsnin memory, language, or cognition ...,yet.,We think it takes at least 15 to 20 yearsnof amyloid plaque accumulation,before it reaches a tipping point,,then triggering a molecular cascade,that causes the clinicalnsymptoms of the disease.,Prior to the tipping point,,your lapses in memorynmight include things like,,"Why did I come in this room?",or "Oh ... what's his name?",or "Where did I put my keys?" 
 Now, before you allnstart freaking out again,,because I know half of you did at leastnone of those in the last 24 hours --,these are all normal kinds of forgetting.,In fact, I would argue that these examples,might not even involve your memory,,because you didn't pay attentionnto where you put your keys,in the first place.,After the tipping point,,the glitches in memory,nlanguage and cognition are different.,Instead of eventually findingnyour keys in your coat pocket,or on the table by the door,,you find them in the refrigerator,,or you find them and you think,,"What are these for?" 
 So what happens when amyloid plaquesnaccumulate to this tipping point?,Our microglia janitor cellsnbecome hyper-activated,,releasing chemicals that causeninflammation and cellular damage.,We think they might actuallynstart clearing away,the synapses themselves.,A crucial neural transport proteinncalled "tau" becomes hyperphosphorylated,and twists itselfninto something called "tangles,",which choke off the neuronsnfrom the inside.,By mid-stage Alzheimer's,nwe have massive inflammation and tangles,and all-out war at the synapse,and cell death. 
 So if you were a scientistntrying to cure this disease,,at what point would you ideallynwant to intervene?,Many scientists are betting bignon the simplest solution:,keep amyloid plaquesnfrom reaching that tipping point,,which means that drug discovery is largelynfocused on developing a compound,that will prevent, eliminate, or reducenamyloid plaque accumulation.,So the cure for Alzheimer's will likely bena preventative medicine.,We're going to have to take this pillnbefore we reach that tipping point,,before the cascade is triggered,,before we start leavingnour keys in the refrigerator.,We think this is why, to date,nthese kinds of drugs have failed,in clinical trials --,not because the science wasn't sound,,but because the people in these trialsnwere already symptomatic.,It was too late.,Think of amyloid plaques as a lit match.,At the tipping point, the matchnsets fire to the forest.,Once the forest is ablaze,,it doesn't do any goodnto blow out the match.,You have to blow out the matchnbefore the forest catches fire. 
 Even before scientists sort this out,,this information is actuallynreally good news for us,,because it turns out that the way we livencan influence the accumulation,of amyloid plaques.,And so there are things we can do,to keep us from reachingnthat tipping point. 
 Let's picture your risknof Alzheimer's as a see-saw scale.,We're going to pilenrisk factors on one arm,,and when that arm hits the floor,nyou are symptomatic,and diagnosed with Alzheimer's.,Let's imagine you're 50 years old.,You're not a spring chicken anymore,,so you've accumulatednsome amyloid plaques with age.,Your scale is tipped a little bit. 
 Now let's look at your DNA.,We've all inherited our genesnfrom our moms and our dads.,Some of these genes will increase our risknand some will decrease it.,If you're like Alice in "Still Alice,",you've inherited a rare genetic mutationnthat cranks out amyloid beta,,and this alone will tipnyour scale arm to the ground.,But for most of us, the genes we inheritnwill only tip the arm a bit.,For example, APOE4 is a gene variantnthat increases amyloid,,but you can inherit a copy of APOE4nfrom mom and dad,and still never get Alzheimer's,,which means that for most of us,,our DNA alone does not determinenwhether we get Alzheimer's.,So what does?,We can't do anything about getting oldernor the genes we've inherited.,So far, we haven't changednour brain's destiny. 
 What about sleep?,In slow-wave deep sleep, our glial cellsnrinse cerebral spinal fluid,throughout our brains,,clearing away metabolic wastenthat accumulated in our synapses,while we were awake.,Deep sleep is likena power cleanse for the brain.,But what happens if you shortchangenyourself on sleep?,Many scientists believe,that poor sleep hygiene might actuallynbe a predictor of Alzheimer's.,A single night of sleep deprivationnleads to an increase in amyloid beta.,And amyloid accumulationnhas been shown to disrupt sleep,,which in turn causesnmore amyloid to accumulate.,And so now we haventhis positive feedback loop,that's going to acceleratenthe tipping of that scale. 
 What else?,Cardiovascular health.,High blood pressure, diabetes,nobesity, smoking, high cholesterol,,have all been shown to increase our risknof developing Alzheimer's.,Some autopsy studies have shown,that as many as 80 percentnof people with Alzheimer's,also had cardiovascular disease.,Aerobic exercise has been shownnin many studies to decrease amyloid beta,in animal models of the disease.,So a heart-healthynMediterranean lifestyle and diet,can help to counternthe tipping of this scale. 
 So there are many things we can do,to prevent or delaynthe onset of Alzheimer's.,But let's saynyou haven't done any of them.,Let's say you're 65;,there's Alzheimer's in your family,nso you've likely inherited a gene or two,that tips your scale arm a bit;,you've been burning the candlenat both ends for years;,you love bacon;,and you don't run unlessnsomeone's chasing you. 
 (Laughter) 
 Let's imagine that your amyloid plaquesnhave reached that tipping point.,Your scale arm has crashed to the floor.,You've tripped the cascade,,setting fire to the forest,,causing inflammation, tangles,nand cell death.,You should be symptomatic for Alzheimer's.,You should be having troublenfinding words and keys,and remembering what I saidnat the beginning of this talk.,But you might not be. 
 There's one more thing you can donto protect yourself,from experiencingnthe symptoms of Alzheimer's,,even if you have the full-blown diseasenpathology ablaze in your brain.,It has to do with neural plasticitynand cognitive reserve.,Remember, the experiencenof having Alzheimer's,is ultimately a result of losing synapses.,The average brain hasnover a hundred trillion synapses,,which is fantastic;nwe've got a lot to work with.,And this isn't a static number.,We gain and lose synapses all the time,,through a processncalled neural plasticity.,Every time we learn something new,,we are creating and strengtheningnnew neural connections,,new synapses. 
 In the Nun Study,,678 nuns, all over the age of 75nwhen the study began,,were followed for more than two decades.,They were regularly givennphysical checkups and cognitive tests,,and when they died, their brainsnwere all donated for autopsy.,In some of these brains, scientistsndiscovered something surprising.,Despite the presence of plaquesnand tangles and brain shrinkage --,what appeared to benunquestionable Alzheimer's --,the nuns who had belongednto these brains showed no signs,of having the diseasenwhile they were alive. 
 How can this be?,We think it's because these nunsnhad a high level of cognitive reserve,,which is a way of saying that they hadnmore functional synapses.,People who have more yearsnof formal education,,who have a high degree of literacy,,who engage regularlynin mentally stimulating activities,,all have more cognitive reserve.,They have an abundancenand a redundancy in neural connections.,So even if they have a diseasenlike Alzheimer's,compromising some of their synapses,,they've got many extra backup connections,,and this buffers them from noticingnthat anything is amiss. 
 Let's imagine a simplified example.,Let's say you only know one thingnabout a subject.,Let's say it's about me.,You know that Lisa Genovanwrote "Still Alice,",and that's the only thingnyou know about me.,You have that single neural connection,,that one synapse.,Now imagine you have Alzheimer's.,You have plaques and tanglesnand inflammation,and microglia devouring that synapse.,Now when someone asks you,n"Hey, who wrote 'Still Alice?'",you can't remember,,because that synapsenis either failing or gone.,You've forgotten me forever. 
 But what if you had learned more about me?,Let's say you learnednfour things about me.,Now imagine you have Alzheimer's,,and three of those synapsesnare damaged or destroyed.,You still have a waynto detour the wreckage.,You can still remember my name.,So we can be resilientnto the presence of Alzheimer's pathology,through the recruitmentnof yet-undamaged pathways.,And we create these pathways,nthis cognitive reserve,,by learning new things.,Ideally, we want these new thingsnto be as rich in meaning as possible,,recruiting sight and soundnand associations and emotion. 
 So this really doesn't meanndoing crossword puzzles.,You don't want to simply retrieveninformation you've already learned,,because this is like travelingndown old, familiar streets,,cruising neighborhoods you already know.,You want to pave new neural roads.,Building an Alzheimer's-resistant brain,means learning to speak Italian,,meeting new friends,,reading a book,,or listening to a great TED Talk. 
 And if, despite all of this, you arensomeday diagnosed with Alzheimer's,,there are three lessons I've learnednfrom my grandmother,and the dozens of people I've come to knownliving with this disease.,Diagnosis doesn't meannyou're dying tomorrow.,Keep living.,You won't lose your emotional memory.,You'll still be ablento understand love and joy.,You might not remembernwhat I said five minutes ago,,but you'll remember how I made you feel.,And you are more than whatnyou can remember. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I remember when I first found out,I was going to speak at a TED conference.,I ran across the hallnto one of my classrooms,to inform my students. 
 "Guess what, guys?,I've been asked to give a TED Talk." 
 The reaction wasn't one I quite expected.,The whole room went silent. 
 "A TED Talk? You mean, like the onenyou made us watch on grit?,Or the one with the scientist that didnthis really awesome thing with robots?",Muhammad asked. 
 "Yes, just like that." 
 "But Coach, those peoplenare really important and smart." 
 (Laughter) 
 "I know that." 
 "But Coach, why are you speaking?nYou hate public speaking." 
 "I do," I admitted,,"But it's important that I speak about us,nthat I speak about your journeys,,about my journey.,People need to know." 
 The students at the all-refugeenschool that I founded,decided to end with somenwords of encouragement. 
 "Cool! It better be good, Coach." 
 (Laughter) 
 There are 65.3 million peoplenwho have been forcibly displaced,from their homes becausenof war or persecution.,The largest number,n11 million, are from Syria.,33,952 people flee their homes daily.,The vast majority remain in refugee camps,,whose conditions cannot be definednas humane under anyone's definition.,We are participatingnin the degradation of humans.,Never have we had numbers this high.,This is the highest numbernof refugees since World War II. 
 Now, let me tell you why this issuenis so important to me.,I am an Arab. I am an immigrant.,I am a Muslim.,I've also spent the last 12 yearsnof my life working with refugees.,Oh -- and I'm also gay.,It makes me really popular these days. 
 (Laughter) 
 But I am the daughter of a refugee.,My grandmother fled Syria in 1964nduring the first Assad regime.,She was three months pregnantnwhen she packed up a suitcase,,piled in her five childrennand drove to neighboring Jordan,,not knowing what the future heldnfor her and her family.,My grandfather decided to stay,nnot believing it was that bad.,He followed her a month later,nafter his brothers were tortured,and his factory was taken overnby the government.,They rebuilt their livesnstarting from scratch,and eventually became independentlynwealthy Jordanian citizens. 
 I was born in Jordan 11 years later.,It was really important to my grandmothernfor us to know our history,and our journey.,I was eight years old when she took mento visit my first refugee camp.,I didn't understand why.,I didn't know whynit was so important to her,for us to go.,I remember walking into the campnholding her hand,,and her saying, "Go play with the kids,",while she visitednwith the women in the camp.,I didn't want to.,These kids weren't like me.,They were poor. They lived in a camp.,I refused.,She knelt down beside menand firmly said, "Go.,And don't come back until you've played.,Don't ever think people are beneath you,or that you have nothingnto learn from others." 
 I reluctantly went.,I never wanted to disappointnmy grandmother.,I returned a few hours later,,having spent some time playing soccernwith the kids in the camp.,We walked out of the camp,,and I was excitedly telling hernwhat a great time I had,and how fantastic the kids were. 
 "Haram!" I said in Arabic. "Poor them." 
 "Haram on us," she said,nusing the word's different meaning,,that we were sinning.,"Don't feel sorry for them;nbelieve in them." 
 It wasn't until I left my countrynof origin for the United States,that I realized the impact of her words. 
 After my college graduation, I applied fornand was granted political asylum,,based on being a member of a social group.,Some people may not realize this,,but you can still get the death penaltynin some countries for being gay.,I had to give up my Jordanian citizenship.,That was the hardest decisionnI've ever had to make,,but I had no other choice.,The point is,,when you find yourself choosingnbetween home and survival,,the question "Where are you from?"nbecomes very loaded.,A Syrian woman who I recently metnat a refugee camp in Greece,articulated it best,,when she recalled the exact momentnshe realized she had to flee Aleppo. 
 "I looked out the windownand there was nothing.,It was all rubble.,There were no stores, no streets,nno schools. Everything was gone.,I had been in my apartment for months,,listening to bombs dropnand watching people die.,But I always thought it would get better,,that no one could force me to leave,,no one could take my home away from me.,And I don't know why it was that morning,nbut when I looked outside,,I realized if I didn't leave,nmy three young children would die.,And so we left.,We left because we had to,nnot because we wanted to.,There was no choice," she said. 
 It's kind of hard to believenthat you belong,when you don't have a home,,when your country of origin rejects younbecause of fear or persecution,,or the city that you grew up innis completely destroyed.,I didn't feel like I had a home.,I was no longer a Jordanian citizen,,but I wasn't American, either.,I felt a kind of loneliness,that is still hardnto put into words today. 
 After college, I desperately needednto find a place to call home.,I bounced around from state to state,and eventually ended up in North Carolina.,Kindhearted people who felt sorry for me,offered to pay rent,or buy me a meal or a suitnfor my new interview.,It just made me feelnmore isolated and incapable.,It wasn't until I met Miss Sarah,,a Southern Baptist who took me innat my lowest and gave me a job,,that I started to believe in myself.,Miss Sarah owned a dinernin the mountains of North Carolina.,I assumed, becausenof my privileged upbringing,and my Seven Sister education,,that she would ask mento manage the restaurant.,I was wrong.,I started off washing dishes,,cleaning toilets and working the grill.,I was humbled; I was shownnthe value of hard work.,But most importantly,nI felt valued and embraced.,I celebrated Christmas with her family,,and she attempted to observenRamadan with me. 
 I remember being very nervousnabout coming out to her --,after all, she was a Southern Baptist.,I sat on the couch next to her,and I said, "Miss Sarah,nyou know that I'm gay.",Her response is onenthat I will never forget. 
 "That's fine, honey.nJust don't be a slut." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 I eventually moved to Atlanta,nstill trying to find my home.,My journey took a strange turnnthree years later,,after I met a group of refugee kidsnplaying soccer outside.,I'd made a wrong turnninto this apartment complex,,and I saw these kidsnoutside playing soccer.,They were playing barefootnwith a raggedy soccer ball,and rocks set up as goals.,I watched them for about an hour,,and after that I was smiling.,The boys reminded me of home.,They reminded me of the waynI grew up playing soccer,in the streets of Jordan,nwith my brothers and cousins.,I eventually joined their game.,They were a little skepticalnabout letting me join it,,because according to them,ngirls don't know how to play.,But obviously I did. 
 I asked them if they hadnever played on a team.,They said they hadn't,nbut that they would love to.,I gradually won them over,nand we formed our first team.,This group of kids would give mena crash course in refugees, poverty,and humanity.,Three brothers from Afghanistan --nRoohullah, Noorullah and Zabiullah --,played a major role in that.,I showed up late to practice one daynto find the field completely deserted.,I was really worried.,My team loved to practice.,It wasn't like them to miss practice.,I got out of my car, and two kidsnran out from behind a dumpster,,waving their hands frantically. 
 "Coach, Rooh got beat up. He got jumped.,There was blood everywhere." 
 "What do you mean?nWhat do you mean he got beat up?" 
 "These bad kids camenand beat him up, Coach.,Everybody left. They were all scared." 
 We hopped into my carnand drove over to Rooh's apartment.,I knocked on the door, and Noor opened it.,"Where's Rooh? I neednto talk to him, see if he's OK.","He's in his room, Coach.nHe's refusing to come out.",I knocked on the door. 
 "Rooh, come on out. I need to talk to you.,I need to see if you're OKnor if we need to go to the hospital." 
 He came out.,He had a big gash on his head,na split lip,,and he was physically shaken.,I was looking at him,,and I asked the boysnto call for their mom,,because I needed to gonto the hospital with him.,They called for their mom.,She came out.,I had my back turned to her,nand she started screaming in Farsi.,The boys fell to the ground laughing.,I was very confused,,because there was nothingnfunny about this.,They explained to me that she said, 
 "You told me your coachnwas a Muslim and a woman.",From behind, I didn't appearnto be either to her. 
 (Laughter) 
 "I am Muslim," I said, turning to her.,"Ašhadu ʾan lā ʾilāha ʾilla (A)llāh,",reciting the Muslim declaration of faith.,Confused,,and perhaps maybe a little bit reassured,,she realized that yes,,I, this American-acting,nshorts-wearing, non-veiled woman,,was indeed a Muslim. 
 Their family had fled the Taliban.,Hundreds of people in their village,were murdered.,Their father was taken in by the Taliban,,only to return a few months later,na shell of the man he once was.,The family escaped to Pakistan,,and the two older boys,nage eight and 10 at the time,,wove rugs for 10 hours a daynto provide for their family.,They were so excited when they found outnthat they had been approved,to resettle in the United States,,making them the lucky 0.1 percentnwho get to do that.,They had hit the jackpot. 
 Their story is not unique.,Every refugee family I have worked withnhas had some version of this.,I work with kids,who have seen their mothers raped,ntheir fathers' fingers sliced off.,One kid saw a bulletnput in his grandmother's head,,because she refused to let the rebelsntake him to be a child soldier.,Their journeys are haunting.,But what I get to see every daynis hope, resilience, determination,,a love of life,and appreciation for being ablento rebuild their lives. 
 I was at the boys' apartment one night,,when the mom came homenafter cleaning 18 hotel rooms in one day.,She sat down, and Noor rubbed her feet,,saying that he was going to take carenof her once he graduated.,She smiled from exhaustion.,"God is good. Life is good.nWe are lucky to be here." 
 In the last two years, we have seennan escalating anti-refugee sentiment.,It's global.,The numbers continue to grownbecause we do nothing to prevent it,and nothing to stop it.,The issue shouldn't be stopping refugeesnfrom coming into our countries.,The issue should bennot forcing them to leave their own. 
 (Applause) 
 Sorry. 
 (Applause) 
 How much more suffering,,how much more suffering must we take?,How many more people need to benforced out of their homes,before we say, "Enough!"?,A hundred million?,Not only do we shame,nblame and reject them,for atrocities that they hadnabsolutely nothing to do with,,we re-traumatize them,,when we're supposed to be welcomingnthem into our countries.,We strip them of their dignitynand treat them like criminals. 
 I had a student in my officena couple of weeks ago.,She's originally from Iraq.,She broke down crying. 
 "Why do they hate us?" 
 "Who hates you?" 
 "Everyone; everyone hates usnbecause we are refugees,,because we are Muslim." 
 In the past, I was ablento reassure my students,that the majority of the worldndoes not hate refugees.,But this time I couldn't.,I couldn't explain to her why someonentried to rip off her mother's hijab,when they were grocery shopping,,or why a player on an opposingnteam called her a terrorist,and told her to go backnwhere she came from.,I couldn't reassure her,that her father's ultimate life sacrifice,by serving in the United Statesnmilitary as an interpreter,would make her more valuednas an American citizen. 
 We take in so few refugees worldwide.,We resettle less than 0.1 percent.,That 0.1 percent benefits usnmore than them.,It dumbfounds me how the word "refugee"nis considered something to be dirty,,something to be ashamed of.,They have nothing to be ashamed of. 
 We have seen advancesnin every aspect of our lives --,except our humanity.,There are 65.3 million peoplenwho have been forced out of their homes,because of war --,the largest number in history.,We are the ones who should be ashamed. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)My son and the iPhonenwere born three weeks apart,in June 2007.,So while those early adoptersnwere lined up outside,,waiting to get their handsnon this amazing new gadget,,I was stuck at homenwith my hands full of something else,that was sending outnconstant notifications -- 
 (Laughter) 
 a miserable, colicky baby,who would only sleep in a moving strollernwith complete silence.,I literally was walkingn10 to 15 miles a day,,and the baby weight came off.,That part was great. 
 But man, was I bored.,Before motherhood, I had been a journalist,who rushed off when the Concorde crashed.,I was one of the firstnpeople into Belgrade,when there was a revolution in Serbia.,Now, I was exhausted.,This walking went on for weeks.,It was only until about three months innthat something shifted, though.,As I pounded the pavement,,my mind started to wander, too.,I began imagining what I would donwhen I finally did sleep again. 
 So the colic did fade,,and I finally got an iPhone,and I put all those hoursnof wandering into action.,I created my dream jobnhosting a public radio show.,So there was no morenrushing off to war zones,,but thanks to my new smartphone,,I could be a mother and a journalist.,I could be on the playgroundnand on Twitter at the same time.,Yeah, well, when I thought that,,when the technology came in and took over,,that is when I hit a wall. 
 So, I want you to picture this:,you host a podcast, and you have to prove,that the investmentnof precious public radio dollars in you,is worth it.,My goal was to increasenmy audience size tenfold.,So one day, I sat down to brainstorm,,as you do,,and I came up barren.,This was differentnthan writer's block, right?,It wasn't like there was something therenwaiting to be unearthed.,There was just nothing.,And so I started to think back:,When was the last timenI actually had a good idea?,Yeah, it was when I was pushingnthat damn stroller.,Now all the cracks in my daynwere filled with phone time.,I checked the headlinesnwhile I waited for my latte.,I updated my calendarnwhile I was sitting on the couch.,Texting turned every spare moment,into a chance to show to my coworkersnand my dear husband,what a responsive person I was,,or at least it was a chance to findnanother perfect couch,for my page on Pinterest.,I realized that I was never bored.,And anyway, don't onlynboring people get bored? 
 But then I started to wonder:,What actually happens to usnwhen we get bored?,Or, more importantly: What happens to usnif we never get bored?,And what could happen if we got rid ofnthis human emotion entirely?,I started talking to neuroscientistsnand cognitive psychologists,,and what they told me was fascinating.,It turns out that when you get bored,,you ignite a network in your brainncalled the "default mode.",So our body, it goes on autopilotnwhile we're folding the laundry,or we're walking to work,,but actually that is when our brainngets really busy.,Here's boredom researcher Dr. Sandi Mann. 
 (Audio) Dr. Sandi Mann:nOnce you start daydreaming,and allow your mind to really wander,,you start thinking a little bitnbeyond the conscious,,a little bit into the subconscious,,which allows sort of differentnconnections to take place.,It's really awesome, actually. 
 Manoush Zomorodi: Totally awesome, right? 
 So this is my brain in an fMRI,,and I learned that in the default modenis when we connect disparate ideas,,we solve some of our mostnnagging problems,,and we do something calledn"autobiographical planning.",This is when we look back at our lives,,we take note of the big moments,nwe create a personal narrative,,and then we set goals,and we figure out what stepsnwe need to take to reach them.,But now we chill out on the couchnalso while updating a Google Doc,or replying to email.,We call it "getting shit done,",but here's what neuroscientistnDr. Daniel Levitin says,we're actually doing. 
 (Audio) Dr. Daniel Levitin:nEvery time you shift your attention,from one thing to another,,the brain has to engagena neurochemical switch,that uses up nutrients in the brainnto accomplish that.,So if you're attempting to multitask,,you know, doing fournor five things at once,,you're not actually doingnfour or five things at once,,because the brain doesn't work that way.,Instead, you're rapidly shiftingnfrom one thing to the next,,depleting neural resources as you go. 
 (Audio) MZ: So switch, switch, switch,nyou're using glucose, glucose, glucose. 
 (Audio) DL: Exactly right, and we havena limited supply of that stuff. 
 MZ: A decade ago, we shiftednour attention at work,every three minutes.,Now we do it every 45 seconds,,and we do it all day long.,The average person checks emailn74 times a day,,and switches tasks on their computer,566 times a day.,I discovered all thisntalking to professor of informatics,,Dr. Gloria Mark. 
 (Audio) Dr. Gloria Mark: So we findnthat when people are stressed,,they tend to shiftntheir attention more rapidly.,We also found, strangely enough,,that the shorter the amount of sleepnthat a person gets,,the more likely they arento check Facebook.,So we're in this vicious, habitual cycle. 
 MZ: But could this cycle be broken?,What would happennif we broke this vicious cycle?,Maybe my listeners could help me find out.,What if we reclaimednthose cracks in our day?,Could it help usnjump-start our creativity?,We called the projectn"Bored and Brilliant.",And I expected, you know,na couple hundred people to play along,,but thousands of peoplenstarted signing up.,And they told me the reasonnthey were doing it,was because they were worriednthat their relationship with their phone,had grown kind of ...n"codependent," shall we say. 
 (Audio) Man: The relationshipnbetween a baby and its teddy bear,or a baby and its binky,or a baby that wants its mother's cradle,when it's done with being heldnby a stranger -- 
 (Laughs) 
 that's the relationshipnbetween me and my phone. 
 (Audio) Woman: I think of my phonenlike a power tool:,extremely useful, but dangerousnif I'm not handling it properly. 
 (Audio) Woman 2:nIf I don't pay close attention,,I'll suddenly realizenthat I've lost an hour of time,doing something totally mindless. 
 MZ: OK, but to really measurenany improvement,,we needed data, right?,Because that's what we do these days.,So we partnered with some appsnthat would measure how much time,we were spending every day on our phone.,If you're thinking it's ironic,that I asked peoplento download another app,so that they would spendnless time on their phones:,yeah, but you gotta meet peoplenwhere they are. 
 (Laughter) 
 So before challenge week,,we were averaging two hoursna day on our phones,and 60 pickups,,you know, like, a quick check,ndid I get a new email?,Here's what Tina, a studentnat Bard College,,discovered about herself. 
 (Audio) Tina: So far, I've been spending,between 150 and 200 minutesnon my phone per day,,and I've been picking up my phonen70 to 100 times per day.,And it's really concerning,,because that's so much timenthat I could have spent,doing something more productive,nmore creative, more towards myself,,because when I'm on my phone,nI'm not doing anything important. 
 MZ: Like Tina, people were startingnto observe their own behavior.,They were getting readynfor challenge week.,And that Monday,,they started to wake upnto instructions in their inbox,,an experiment to try. 
 Day one:,"Put it in your pocket.",Take that phone out of your hand.,See if you can eliminate the reflexnto check it all day long,,just for a day.,And if this sounds easy,,you haven't tried it.,Here's listener Amanda Itzko. 
 (Audio) Amanda Itzko:nI am absolutely itching.,I feel a little bit crazy,,because I have noticednthat I pick up my phone,when I'm just walkingnfrom one room to another,,getting on the elevator,,and even -- and this is the partnthat I am really embarrassed,to actually say out loud --,in the car. 
 MZ: Yikes.,Yeah, well, but as Amanda learned,,this itching feelingnis not actually her fault.,That is exactly the behaviornthat the technology is built to trigger. 
 (Laughter) 
 I mean, right?,Here's former Google designer,nTristan Harris. 
 (Audio) Tristan Harris: If I'm Facebooknor I'm Netflix or I'm Snapchat,,I have literally a thousand engineers,whose job is to getnmore attention from you.,I'm very good at this,,and I don't want you to ever stop.,And you know, the CEOnof Netflix recently said,,"Our biggest competitorsnare Facebook, YouTube and sleep.",I mean, so there's a million placesnto spend your attention,,but there's a war going on to get it. 
 MZ: I mean, you know the feeling:,that amazing episodenof "Transparent" ends,,and then the next one starts playing,so you're like, eh, OK fine,nI'll just stay up and watch it.,Or the LinkedIn progress barnsays you are this close,to having the perfect profile,,so you add a little morenpersonal information.,As one UX designer told me,,the only people who refernto their customers as "users",are drug dealers and technologists. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 And users, as we know,nare worth a lot of money.,Here's former Facebooknproduct manager and author,,Antonio García Martínez. 
 (Audio) Antonio García Martínez:nThe saying is, if any product is free,then you're the product;nyour attention is the product.,But what is your attention worth?,That's why literally every timenyou load a page,,not just on Facebook or any app,,there's an auction being held instantly,nbillions of times a day,,for exactly how muchnthat one ad impression cost. 
 MZ: By the way, the average personnwill spend two years of their life,on Facebook.,So, back to challenge week.,Immediately, we sawnsome creativity kick in.,Here's New Yorker Lisa Alpert. 
 (Audio) Lisa Alpert: I was bored, I guess.,So I suddenly looked at the stairwaynthat went up to the top of the station,,and I thought, you know,,I had just come down that stairway,nbut I could go back up,and then come back downnand get a little cardio.,So I did,,and then I had a little more time,nso I did it again and I did it again,,and I did it 10 times.,And I had a complete cardio workout.,I got on that R train feelingnkind of exhausted,,but, like, wow,nthat had never occurred to me.,How is that possible? 
 (Laughter) 
 MZ: So creativity, I learned, meansndifferent things to different people. 
 (Laughter) 
 But everyone foundnday three's challenge the hardest.,It was called "Delete that app.",Take that app -- you know the one;,that one that always gets you,nit sucks you in --,take it off your phone,,even if just for the day.,I deleted the game Two Dotsnand nearly cried. 
 (Laughter) 
 Yeah, Two Dots playersnknow what I'm talking about.,But my misery had good company. 
 (Audio) Man 2: This is Liamnin Los Angeles,,and I deleted Twitter, Facebook,nInstagram, Tumblr, Snapchat and Vine,from my phone,in one fell swoop.,And it was kind of an embarrassinglynemotional experience at first.,It felt weirdly lonelynto look at that lock screen,with no new notifications on it.,But I really liked deciding for myself,when to think about or accessnmy social networks,,not giving my phone the powernto decide that for me.,So thank you. 
 (Audio) Woman 3: Deleting the Twitter appnwas very sad,,and I feel I maybe, over the last yearnwhen I've been on Twitter,,have developed an addiction to it,,and this "Bored and Brilliant" challengenhas really made me realize it.,After a brief period of really horriblenwithdrawal feeling,,like lack-of-caffeine headache,,I now feel lovely.,I had a lovely dinner with my family,,and I hope to continue this structured usenof these powerful tools. 
 (Audio) Woman 4: I don't haventhat guilty gut feeling,I have when I knownI'm wasting time on my phone.,Maybe I'll have to start giving myselfnchallenges and reminders like this,every morning. 
 MZ: I mean, yes, this was progress.,I could not wait to seenwhat the numbers said,at the end of that week.,But when the data came in,,it turned out that we had cut down,,on average,,just six minutes --,from 120 minutes a day on our phones,to 114.,Yeah. Whoop-de-do. 
 So I went back to the scientistsnfeeling kind of low,,and they just laughed at me,,and they said, you know,nchanging people's behavior,in such a short time period,was ridiculously ambitious,,and actually what you've achievednis far beyond what we thought possible.,Because more important than the numbers,nwere the people's stories.,They felt empowered.,Their phones had been transformed,from taskmasters,back into tools. 
 And actually, I found whatnthe young people said most intriguing.,Some of them told me,that they didn't recognizensome of the emotions,that they felt during challenge week,,because, if you think about it,,if you have never known lifenwithout connectivity,,you may never have experienced boredom.,And there could be consequences.,Researchers at USC have found --nthey're studying teenagers,who are on social medianwhile they're talking to their friends,or they're doing homework,,and two years down the road,nthey are less creative and imaginative,about their own personal futures,and about solving societal problems,nlike violence in their neighborhoods.,And we really need this next generation,to be able to focus on some big problems:,climate change, economic disparity,,massive cultural differences.,No wonder CEOs in an IBM survey,identified creativity as the number onenleadership competency. 
 OK, here's the good news, though:,In the end, 20,000 peoplendid "Bored and Brilliant" that week.,Ninety percent cut down on their minutes.,Seventy percent got more time to think.,People told me that they slept better.,They felt happier.,My favorite note was from a guynwho said he felt like he was waking up,from a mental hibernation. 
 Some personal data and some neuroscience,gave us permissionnto be offline a little bit more,,and a little bit of boredomngave us some clarity,and helped some of us set some goals.,I mean, maybe constant connectivity,won't be cool in a couple of years.,But meanwhile, teaching people,nespecially kids,,how to use technologynto improve their lives,and to self-regulate,needs to be part of digital literacy. 
 So the next time you gonto check your phone,,remember that if you don't decidenhow you're going to use the technology,,the platforms will decide for you.,And ask yourself:,What am I really looking for?,Because if it's to check email,nthat's fine -- do it and be done.,But if it's to distract yourselfnfrom doing the hard work,that comes with deeper thinking,,take a break,,stare out the window,and know that by doing nothing,you are actually beingnyour most productive and creative self.,It might feel weirdnand uncomfortable at first,,but boredom truly can lead to brilliance. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So, I love making toolsnand sharing them with people.,I remember as a child,,my first tool I builtnwas actually a microscope,that I built by stealing lensesnfrom my brother's eyeglasses.,He wasn't that thrilled.,But, you know, maybenbecause of that moment,,30 years later,,I'm still making microscopes.,And the reason I built these toolsnis for moments like this. 
 (Video) Girl: I havenblack things in my hair -- 
 Manu Prakash: This is a schoolnin the Bay Area. 
 (Video) MP: The living worldnfar supersedes our imagination,of how things actually work. 
 (Video) Boy: Oh my God! 
 MP: Right -- oh my God!,I hadn't realized this would bensuch a universal phrase. 
 Over the last two years,,in my lab,,we built 50,000 Foldscopes,and shipped themnto 130 countries in the world,,at no cost to the kids we sent them to.,This year alone,,with the support of our community,,we are planning to shipna million microscopes,to kids around the world.,What does that do?,It creates an inspiring communitynof people around the world,,learning and teaching each other,,from Kenya to Kampalanto Kathmandu to Kansas. 
 And one of the phenomenal thingsnthat I love about this,is the sense of community.,There's a kid in Nicaragua,teaching others how to identifynmosquito species that carry dengue,by looking at the larvanunder a microscope.,There's a pharmacologistnwho came up with a new way,to detect fake drugs anywhere.,There is a girl who wondered:,"How does glitter actually work?",and discovered the physicsnof crystalline formation in glitter.,There is an Argentinian doctor,who's trying to do field cervical cancernscreening with this tool.,And yours very truly foundna species of flea,that was dug inside my heel in my footnone centimeter deep. 
 Now, you might thinknof these as anomalies.,But there is a method to this madness.,I call this "frugal science" --,the idea of sharingnthe experience of science,,and not just the information.,To remind you:,there are a billion people on this planet,who live with absolutelynno infrastructure:,no roads,,no electricity,and thus, no health care.,Also, there a billion kidsnon this planet that live in poverty.,How are we supposed to inspire them,for the next generationnof solution makers?,There are health care workersnthat we put on the line,to fight infectious diseases,,to protect us with absolutelynbare-minimum tools and resources. 
 So as a lab at Stanford,,I think of this from a contextnof frugal science,and building solutionsnfor these communities.,Often we think about being able to dondiagnosis under a tree, off-grid.,I'll tell you two examplesntoday of new tools.,One of them starts in Uganda.,In 2013,,on a field trip to detectnschistosomiasis with Foldscopes,,I made a minor observation.,In a clinic,,in a far, remote area,,I saw a centrifugenbeing used as a doorstop.,I mean -- quite literally, the doorstop.,And I asked them and they said,,"Oh, we don't actually have electricity,,so this piece of junknis good as a doorstop.",Centrifuges, for some of younwho don't know,,are the pinnacle tool to be ablento do sample processing.,You separate componentsnof blood or body fluids,to be able to detectnand identify pathogens.,But centrifuges are bulky, expensive --,cost around 1,000 dollars --,and really hard to carry out in the field.,And of course,,they don't work without power.,Sound familiar?,So we started thinkingnabout solving this problem,,and I came back --,kept thinking about toys. 
 Now ...,I have a few with me here.,I first started with yo-yos ...,and I'm a terrible yo-yo thrower.,Because these objects spin,,we wondered,,could we actually usenthe physics of these objects,to be able to build centrifuges?,This was possibly the worstnthrow I could make.,But you might start realizing,,if you start exploringnthe space of toys --,we tried these spinning tops,,and then in the lab,,we stumbled upon this wonder. 
 It's the whirligig,nor a buzzer, or a rundle.,A couple of strings and a little disk,,and if I push, it spins.,How many of you have playednwith this as a kid?,This is called a button-on-a-string.,OK, maybe 50 percent of you.,What you didn't realize --,that this little object,is the oldest toynin the history of mankind ...,5,000 years ago.,We have found relics of this objectnhidden around on our planet.,Now the irony is,,we actually don't understandnhow this little thing works.,That's when I get excited. 
 So we got back to work,,wrote down a couple of equations.,If you take the input torquenthat you put in,,you take the drag on this disc,,and the twist drag on these strings,,you should be ablento mathematically solve this.,This is not the only equation in my talk.,Ten pages of math later,,we could actually write downnthe complete analytical solution,for this dynamic system.,And out comes what we call "Paperfuge.",That's my postdoc Saad Bhamla,,who's the co-inventor of Paperfuge.,And to the left, you seenall the centrifuges,that we're trying to replace. 
 This little object that you see right here,is a disc, a couplenof strings and a handle.,And when I spin,and I push,,it starts to spin.,Now, when you realize,,when you do the math,,when we calculate the rpm for this object,,mathematically, we should be ablento go all the way to a million rpm.,Now, there is a little twistnin human anatomy,,because the resonant frequencynof this object is about 10 hertz,,and if you've ever played the piano,,you can't go highernthan two or three hertz.,The maximum speed we've been ablento achieve with this object,is not 10,000 rpm,,not 50,000 rpm --,120,000 rpm.,That's equal to 30,000 g-forces.,If I was to stick you right herenand have it spin,,you would think about the typesnof forces you would experience. 
 One of the factors of a tool like this,is to be able to do diagnosis with this.,So, I'm going to dona quick demo here, where --,this is a moment where I'm goingnto make a little finger prick,,and a tiny drop of bloodnis going to come out.,If you don't like blood,nyou don't have to look at it.,Here is a little lancet.,These lancets are available everywhere,,completely passive.,And if I've had breakfast today ...,That didn't hurt at all.,OK, I take a little capillarynwith a drop of blood --,now this drop of blood has answers,,that's why I'm interested in it.,It might actually tell me whethernI have malaria right now or not.,I take a little capillary,,and you see it starts wicking in.,I'm going to draw a little more blood.,And that's good enough for right now.,Now, I just seal this capillarynby putting it in clay.,And now that's sealed the sample. 
 We're going to take the sample,,mount it on Paperfuge.,A little piece of tapento make a sealed cavity.,So now the sample is completely enclosed.,And we are ready for a spin.,I'm pushing and pulling with this object.,I'm going to load this up ...,And you see the object starts spinning.,Unlike a regular centrifuge,,this is a counter-rotating centrifuge.,It goes back and forth, back and forth ...,And now I'm charging it up,,and you see it builds momentum.,And now -- I don't knownif you can hear this --,30 seconds of this,,and I should be able to separatenall the blood cells with the plasma.,And the ratio of those blood ncells to plasma -- 
 (Applause) 
 Already, if you see right here,,if you focus on this,,you should be able to seena separated volume,of blood and plasma.,And the ratio of that actually tells menwhether I might be anemic. 
 One of the aspects of this is,nwe build many types of Paperfuges.,This one allows us to identifynmalaria parasites,by running them for a little longer,,and we can identify malaria parasitesnthat are in the blood,that we can separate out and detectnwith something like a centrifuge.,Another version of this allows mento separate nucleic acids,to be able to do nucleic acid testsnout in the field itself.,Here is another version that allows mento separate bulk samples,,and then, finally,,something new that we've been working on,to be able to implement the entirenmultiplex test on an object like this.,So where you do the sample preparationnand the chemistry in the same object. 
 Now ...,this is all good,,but when you start thinking about this,,you have to share these tools with people.,And one of the things we did is --nwe just got back from Madagascar;,this is what clinical trialsnfor malaria look like -- 
 (Laughter) 
 You can do this while having coffee.,But most importantly,,this is a village six hours from any road.,We are in a room with one of the seniornmembers of the community,and a health care worker.,It really is this portion of the worknthat excites me the most --,that smile,,to be able to share simple but powerfulntools with people around the world.,Now, I forgot to tell you this,,that all of that cost me 20 cents to make. 
 OK, in the negative time I have left,,I'll tell you about the most recent -- 
 (Laughter) 
 invention from our lab.,It's called Abuzz --,the idea that all of youncould help us fight mosquitoes;,you could all help us track our enemies.,These are enemies because they causenmalaria, Zika, chikungunya, dengue.,But the challenge is that we actuallyndon't know where our enemies are.,The world map for wherenmosquitoes are is missing.,So we started thinking about this.,There are 3,500 species of mosquitoes,,and they're all very similar.,Some of them are so identical,that even an entomologist cannotnidentify them under a microscope. 
 But they have an Achilles' heel.,This is what mosquitoes flirtingnwith each other looks like.,That's a male chasing a female.,They're actually talking to each othernwith their wingbeat frequencies.,(Buzzing sound),And thus, they have a signature.,We realized that using a regular phone,,a $5-10 flip phone --,how many remember what this object is? 
 (Laughter) 
 We can record these acousticnsignatures from mosquitoes.,I'll tell you exactly how to do this. 
 I caught some mosquitoes outside.,Unlike Bill [Gates], I'm notngoing to release them. 
 (Laughter) 
 But I will tell you hownto record from this.,All you do is tap them and they fly.,You can first test --,I can actually hear that.,And you bring your phone,nwhich has microphones --,it turns out the micsnare so damn good already,,even on regular phones,,that you can pick upnthis near-field signature.,And since I'm out of time,,let me just play the recordingnthat I made a day ago. 
 (Mosquitoes buzz) 
 This is all the charming soundnthat you heard before,that you all love.,One of the contexts of this,is that being able to do thisnwith a regular cell phone,allows us to map mosquito species.,Using a flip phone,,we mapped one of the largestnacoustic databases,with 25 to 20 species of mosquitoesnthat carry human pathogens.,And from this and machine learning,,anybody who uploads this data,,we can identify and tell the probability,of what species of mosquitoesnyou're actually working with.,We call this Abuzz,nand if any of you want to sign up,,just go to the website. 
 Let me close with something,that's very importantnand dear to my heart.,One of the challenges of todaynis we have terrible problems.,We have a billion peoplenwith absolutely no health care,,climate change, biodiversity loss,,on and on and on.,And we hope that sciencenis going to provide the answer. 
 But before you leave this theatre today,,I want you to promise one thing.,We're going to make science accessible --,not just to the people who can afford it,,but a billion others who can't.,Let's make science and scientificnliteracy a human right.,The moment that you pass the tinglingnfeeling of making a discovery,to another child,,you're enabling them to benthe next group of people,who will actually solve these problems. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)(Laughter) 
 (Laughter) 
 That's SpotMini.,He'll be back in a little while. 
 I -- 
 (Applause) 
 I love building robots.,And my long-term goal is to build robots,that can do what people and animals do.,And there's three things in particular,that we're interested in.,One is balance and dynamic mobility,,the second one is mobile manipulation,,and the third one is mobile perception. 
 So, dynamic mobility and balance --,I'm going to do a demo for you.,I'm standing here, balancing.,I can see you're not very impressed.nOK, how about now? 
 (Laughter) 
 How about now? 
 (Applause) 
 Those simple capabilities mean that peoplencan go almost anywhere on earth,,on any kind of terrain.,We want to capture that for robots. 
 What about manipulation?,I'm holding this clicker in my hand;,I'm not even looking at it,,and I can manipulate itnwithout any problem.,But even more important,,I can move my body while I holdnthe manipulator, the clicker,,and stabilize and coordinate my body,,and I can even walk around.,And that meansnI can move around in the world,and expand the rangenof my arms and my hands,and really be able to handlenalmost anything.,So that's mobile manipulation.,And all of you can do this. 
 Third is perception.,I'm looking at a roomnwith over 1,000 people in it,,and my amazing visual systemncan see every one of you --,you're all stable in space,,even when I move my head,,even when I move around.,That kind of mobile perceptionnis really important for robots,that are going to move and act,out in the world. 
 I'm going to give youna little status report,on where we are in developing robotsntoward these ends.,The first three robots are allndynamically stabilized robots.,This one goes backna little over 10 years ago --,"BigDog.",It's got a gyroscopenthat helps stabilize it.,It's got sensors and a control computer. 
 Here's a Cheetah robotnthat's running with a galloping gait,,where it recycles its energy,,it bounces on the ground,,and it's computing all the time,in order to keep itselfnstabilized and propelled. 
 And here's a bigger robot,that's got such goodnlocomotion using its legs,,that it can go in deep snow.,This is about 10 inches deep,,and it doesn't really have any trouble. 
 This is Spot, a new generation of robot --,just slightly older than the onenthat came out onstage.,And we've been asking the question --,you've all heard about drone delivery:,Can we deliver packagesnto your houses with drones?,Well, what about plain oldnlegged-robot delivery? 
 (Laughter) 
 So we've been taking our robotnto our employees' homes,to see whether we could get in -- 
 (Laughter) 
 the various access ways.,And believe me, in the Boston area,,there's every mannernof stairway twists and turns.,So it's a real challenge.,But we're doing very well,nabout 70 percent of the way. 
 And here's mobile manipulation,,where we've put an arm on the robot,,and it's finding its way through the door.,Now, one of the important thingsnabout making autonomous robots,is to make them not donjust exactly what you say,,but make them deal with the uncertaintynof what happens in the real world.,So we have Steve there,none of the engineers,,giving the robot a hard time. 
 (Laughter) 
 And the fact that the programmingnstill tolerates all that disturbance --,it does what it's supposed to. 
 Here's another example,nwhere Eric is tugging on the robot,as it goes up the stairs.,And believe me,,getting it to do what it's supposed to donin those circumstances,is a real challenge,,but the result is somethingnthat's going to generalize,and make robots much more autonomousnthan they would be otherwise. 
 This is Atlas, a humanoid robot.,It's a third-generation humanoidnthat we've been building.,I'll tell you a little bitnabout the hardware design later.,And we've been saying:,How close to human levelsnof performance and speed could we get,in an ordinary task,,like moving boxes around on a conveyor?,We're getting up to about two-thirdsnof the speed that a human operates,on average.,And this robot is using both hands,nit's using its body,,it's stepping,,so it's really an examplenof dynamic stability,,mobile manipulation,and mobile perception.,Here -- 
 (Laughter) 
 We actually have two Atlases. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, everything doesn't go exactlynthe way it's supposed to. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Laughter) 
 (Laughter) 
 And here's our latest robot,ncalled "Handle.",Handle is interesting,nbecause it's sort of half like an animal,,and it's half something else,with these leg-like things and wheels.,It's got its arms onnin kind of a funny way,,but it really does some remarkable things.,It can carry 100 pounds.,It's probably going to liftnmore than that,,but so far we've done 100.,It's got some pretty goodnrough-terrain capability,,even though it has wheels.,And Handle loves to put on a show. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 I'm going to give youna little bit of robot religion.,A lot of people think that a robotnis a machine where there's a computer,that's telling it what to do,,and the computer is listeningnthrough its sensors.,But that's really only half of the story.,The real story isnthat the computer is on one side,,making suggestions to the robot,,and on the other sidenare the physics of the world.,And that physics involves gravity,nfriction, bouncing into things.,In order to have a successful robot,,my religion is that you have to dona holistic design,,where you're designing the software,nthe hardware and the behavior,all at one time,,and all these parts really intermeshnand cooperate with each other.,And when you get the perfect design,nyou get a real harmony,between all those partsninteracting with each other.,So it's half software and half hardware,,plus the behavior. 
 We've done some work latelynon the hardware, where we tried to go --,the picture on the leftnis a conventional design,,where you have partsnthat are all bolted together,,conductors, tubes, connectors.,And on the rightnis a more integrated thing;,it's supposed to look likenan anatomy drawing.,Using the miracle of 3-D printing,,we're starting to build parts of robots,that look a lot morenlike the anatomy of an animal.,So that's an upper-leg partnthat has hydraulic pathways --,actuators, filters --,all embedded, all printed as one piece,,and the whole structure is developed,with a knowledge of what the loadsnand behavior are going to be,,which is available from datanrecorded from robots,and simulations and things like that. 
 So it's a data-driven hardware design.,And using processes like that,,not only the upper legnbut some other things,,we've gotten our robots to go from big,nbehemoth, bulky, slow, bad robots --,that one on the right,nweighing almost 400 pounds --,down to the one in the middlenwhich was just in the video,,weighs about 190 pounds,,just a little bit more than me,,and we have a new one,,which is working but I'm notngoing to show it to you yet,,on the left,,which weighs just 165 pounds,,with all the samenstrength and capabilities.,So these things are really gettingnbetter very quickly. 
 So it's time for Spot to come back out,,and we're going to demonstratena little bit of mobility,,dexterity and perception.,This is Seth Davis,nwho's my robot wrangler today,,and he's giving Spotnsome general direction,by steering it around,,but all the coordinationnof the legs and the sensors,is done by the robot's computers on board.,The robot can walknwith a number of different gaits;,it's got a gyro,,or a solid-state gyro,,an IMU on board.,Obviously, it's got a battery,nand things like that.,One of the cool thingsnabout a legged robot is,,it's omnidirectional.,In addition to going forward,nit can go sideways,,it can turn in place.,And this robotnis a little bit of a show-off.,It loves to use its dynamic gaits,,like running -- 
 (Laughter) 
 And it's got one more. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now if it were really a show-off,nit would be hopping on one foot,,but, you know. 
 Now, Spot has a set of camerasnhere, stereo cameras,,and we have a feed up in the center.,It's kind of dark out in the audience,,but it's going to use those camerasnin order to look at the terrain,right in front of it,,while it goes overnthese obstacles back here.,For this demo, Seth is steering,,but the robot's doingnall its own terrain planning.,This is a terrain map,,where the data from the camerasnis being developed in real time,,showing the red spots,nwhich are where it doesn't want to step,,and the green spots are the good places.,And here it's treatingnthem like stepping-stones.,So it's trying to stay up on the blocks,,and it adjusts its stride,,and there's a ton of planning,that has to go intonan operation like that,,and it does allnthat planning in real time,,where it adjusts the stepsna little bit longer,or a little bit shorter. 
 Now we're going to change itninto a different mode,,where it's just going to treatnthe blocks like terrain,and decide whether to step up or down,as it goes.,So this is using dynamic balance,and mobile perception,,because it has to coordinate what it seesnalong with how it's moving. 
 The other thing Spot has is a robot arm.,Some of you may see thatnas a head and a neck,,but believe me, it's an arm.,Seth is driving it around.,He's actually driving the handnand the body is following.,So the two are coordinatednin the way I was talking about before --,in the way people can do that.,In fact, one of the cool thingsnSpot can do we call, "chicken-head mode,",and it keeps its headnin one place in space,,and it moves its body all around.,There's a variation of thisnthat's called "twerking" -- 
 (Laughter) 
 but we're not going to use that today. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, Spot: I'm feeling a little thirsty.nCould you get me a soda?,For this demo,nSeth is not doing any driving.,We have a LIDAR on the back of the robot,,and it's using these propsnwe've put on the stage,to localize itself.,It's gone over to that location.,Now it's using a camera that's in its hand,to find the cup,,picks it up --,and again, Seth's not driving.,We've planned out a path for it to go --,it looked like it wasngoing off the path --,and now Seth's goingnto take over control again,,because I'm a little bit chickennabout having it do this by itself.,Thank you, Spot. 
 (Applause) 
 So, Spot:,How do you feel about having just finishednyour TED performance? 
 (Laughter) 
 Me, too! 
 (Laughter) 
 Thank you all,,and thanks to the team at Boston Dynamics,,who did all the hard work behind this. 
 (Applause) 
 Helen Walters: Marc,ncome back in the middle.,Thank you so much.,Come over here, I have questions. 
 So, you mentioned the UPSnand the package delivery.,What are the other applicationsnthat you see for your robots? 
 Marc Raibert: You know,nI think that robots,that have the capabilitiesnI've been talking about,are going to be incredibly useful.,About a year ago, I went to Fukushima,to see what the situation was there,,and there's just a huge need,for machines that can goninto some of the dirty places,and help remediate that. 
 I think it won't be too long untilnwe have robots like this in our homes,,and one of the big needsnis to take care of the aging,and invalids.,I think that it won't be too longntill we're using robots,to help take care of our parents,,or probably more likely,nhave our children help take care of us.,And there's a bunch of other things.,I think the sky's the limit.,Many of the ideasnwe haven't thought of yet,,and people like you will help usnthink of new applications. 
 HW: So what about the dark side?,What about the military?,Are they interested? 
 MR: Sure, the military has beenna big funder of robotics.,I don't think the militarynis the dark side myself,,but I think, as with allnadvanced technology,,it can be used for all kinds of things. 
 HW: Awesome. Thank you so much. 
 MR: OK, you're welcome. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Paying close attention to something:,Not that easy, is it?,It's because our attention is pullednin so many different directions at a time,,and it's in fact pretty impressivenif you can stay focused. 
 Many people think that attentionnis all about what we are focusing on,,but it's also about what informationnour brain is trying to filter out. 
 There are two waysnyou direct your attention.,First, there's overt attention.,In overt attention,nyou move your eyes towards something,in order to pay attention to it.,Then there's covert attention.,In covert attention,nyou pay attention to something,,but without moving your eyes.,Think of driving for a second.,Your overt attention,nyour direction of the eyes,,are in front,,but that's your covert attention,which is constantly scanningnthe surrounding area,,where you don't actually look at them. 
 I'm a computational neuroscientist,,and I work on cognitivenbrain-machine interfaces,,or bringing togethernthe brain and the computer.,I love brain patterns.,Brain patterns are important for us,because based on themnwe can build models for the computers,,and based on these models,computers can recognizenhow well our brain functions.,And if it doesn't function well,,then these computers themselvesncan be used as assistive devices,for therapies.,But that also means something,,because choosing the wrong patterns,will give us the wrong models,and therefore the wrong therapies.,Right?,In case of attention,,the fact that we can,shift our attention not only by our eyes,but also by thinking --,that makes covert attentionnan interesting model for computers. 
 So I wanted to knownwhat are the brainwave patterns,when you look overtlynor when you look covertly.,I set up an experiment for that.,In this experimentnthere are two flickering squares,,one of them flickeringnat a slower rate than the other one.,Depending on which of these flickersnyou are paying attention to,,certain parts of your brainnwill start resonating in the same rate,as that flickering rate.,So by analyzing your brain signals,,we can track where exactlynyou are watching,or you are paying attention to. 
 So to see what happens in your brainnwhen you pay overt attention,,I asked people to look directlynin one of the squares,and pay attention to it.,In this case, not surprisingly,nwe saw that these flickering squares,appeared in their brain signals,which was comingnfrom the back of their head,,which is responsible for the processingnof your visual information.,But I was really interested,to see what happens in your brainnwhen you pay covert attention.,So this time I asked peoplento look in the middle of the screen,and without moving their eyes,,to pay attentionnto either of these squares.,When we did that,,we saw that both of these flickering ratesnappeared in their brain signals,,but interestingly,,only one of them,nwhich was paid attention to,,had stronger signals,,so there was something in the brain,which was handling this information,so that thing in the brain was basicallynthe activation of the frontal area.,The front part of your brainnis responsible,for higher cognitive functions as a human.,The frontal part,nit seems that it works as a filter,trying to let information come innonly from the right flicker,that you are paying attention to,and trying to inhibit the informationncoming from the ignored one. 
 The filtering ability of the brainnis indeed a key for attention,,which is missing in some people,,for example in people with ADHD.,So a person with ADHDncannot inhibit these distractors,,and that's why they can't focusnfor a long time on a single task.,But what if this person,could play a specific computer game,with his brain connected to the computer,,and then train his own brain,to inhibit these distractors? 
 Well, ADHD is just one example.,We can use these cognitivenbrain-machine interfaces,for many other cognitive fields.,It was just a few years ago,that my grandfather had a stroke,nand he lost complete ability to speak.,He could understand everybody,nbut there was no way to respond,,even not writingnbecause he was illiterate.,So he passed away in silence.,I remember thinking at that time:,What if we could have a computer,which could speak for him?,Now, after years that I am in this field,,I can see that this might be possible.,Imagine if we can find brainwave patterns,when people thinknabout images or even letters,,like the letter A generatesna different brainwave pattern,than the letter B, and so on.,Could a computer one dayncommunicate for people who can't speak?,What if a computer,can help us understandnthe thoughts of a person in a coma?,We are not there yet,,but pay close attention.,We will be there soon. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Back home, my friends call me nicknames,,such as "The Giant Clam Girl,","Clam Queen,",or, "The Mother of Clams." 
 (Laughter) 
 This is because every time I see them,,I talk nonstop about giant clams all day,,every day.,Giant clams are these massivenand colorful shelled marine animals,,the largest of its kind.,Just look at this shell.,The biggest recorded individualnwas four-and-a-half-feet long,and weighed about 550 pounds.,That is almost as heavynas three baby elephants. 
 South Pacific legends once describedngiant clams as man-eaters,that would lie in wait on the seabednto trap unsuspecting divers.,A story goes that a divernhad lost his legs,while trying to retrieve a pearlnfrom a giant clam.,I thought, "Really?",So out of curiosity,,I did an experiment using myself as bait. 
 (Laughter) 
 I carefully placed my handninto the clam's mouth and waited.,Hmm ...,I still have my hand.,It seems that these gentle giantsnwould rather retreat,and protect their fleshy bodies,than feed on me.,So much for those killer clam myths! 
 Unfortunately, the reality is,,we are the giant clams' biggest threat.,Considered a delicacy throughoutnthe Western Pacific and Indian Oceans,,giant clams have been traditionallynfished as seafood.,Fishermen are particularly interestednin their adductor muscles,,which are organs that holdnthe two shells together like a hinge.,Just for their muscles,,giant clams were almostnhunted to extinction,between the 1960s and 1980s.,Clamshells are also popularnin the ornamental trade,as jewelry and for display.,In the South China Sea,,fishermen went out of their waynto collect fossilized clamshells,by digging through large areasnof coral reefs.,These were later carved and soldnas so-called "ivory handicrafts" in China.,Giant clams, dead or alive,nare not safe from us.,It's a "clamity!" 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 With the spotlight on morencharismatic marine animals,such as the whales and coral reefs,,it is easy to forget that othernmarine life needs our help, too.,My fascination with giant clamsngot me started on conservation research,to fill in the knowledge gapsnon their ecology and behavior.,One of the discoveries that we madenwas that giant clams could walk,across the seafloor.,Yes, you heard me right:,they can walk. 
 To find out,,we placed numerous baby clams on a grid.,Now watch what happens over 24 hours.,We think that walking is importantnfor getting away from predators,and finding mates for breeding.,While it can hard to imaginenany movement in these enormous animals,,giant clams up to 400 poundsncan still walk,,they just move slower. 
 During my PhD, I discoverednmore secrets about the giant clams.,But there was somethingnmissing in my work.,I found myself asking,,"Why should people carenabout conserving giant clams?" --,other than myself, of course. 
 (Laughter) 
 It turns out that giant clamsnhave a giant impact on coral reefs.,These multitasking clamsnare reef builders,,food factories,,shelters for shrimps and crabs,and water filters,,all rolled into one.,In a nutshell,,giant clams play a major contributing role,as residents of their own reef home,,and just having them aroundnkeeps the reef healthy.,And because they can livenup to 100 years old,,giant clams make vital indicatorsnof coral reef health.,So when giant clamsnstart to disappear from coral reefs,,their absence can serve as an alarm bell,for scientists to start paying attention,,similar to the canary in a coal mine.,But giant clams are endangered.,The largest clam in the worldnis facing the threat of extinction,,with more than 50 percentnof the wild population severely depleted.,And the ecological benefitsnof having giant clams on coral reefs,are likely to continuenonly if populations are healthy,,making their conservation paramount. 
 So I stand here today to give a voicento the giant clams,,because I care a whole lotnfor these amazing animals,,and they deserve to be cared for.,It is time for the giant clamsnto step out of their shells,,and show the world that they, too,ncan be the heroes of the oceans. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)So, imagine that you hadnyour smartphone miniaturized,and hooked up directly to your brain.,If you had this sort of brain chip,,you'd be able to uploadnand download to the internet,at the speed of thought.,Accessing social media or Wikipedianwould be a lot like --,well, from the inside at least --,like consulting your own memory.,It would be as easynand as intimate as thinking.,But would it make it easiernfor you to know what's true?,Just because a waynof accessing information is faster,it doesn't mean it's morenreliable, of course,,and it doesn't mean that we would allninterpret it the same way.,And it doesn't mean that you would benany better at evaluating it.,In fact, you might even be worse,,because, you know, more data,nless time for evaluation. 
 Something like this is alreadynhappening to us right now.,We already carry a world of informationnaround in our pockets,,but it seems as if the more informationnwe share and access online,,the more difficult it can be for usnto tell the difference,between what's real and what's fake.,It's as if we know morenbut understand less. 
 Now, it's a featurenof modern life, I suppose,,that large swaths of the publicnlive in isolated information bubbles.,We're polarized: not just over values,nbut over the facts.,One reason for that is, the datananalytics that drive the internet,get us not just more information,,but more of the information that we want.,Our online life is personalized;,everything from the ads we read,to the news that comes downnour Facebook feed,is tailored to satisfy our preferences.,And so while we get more information,,a lot of that information ends upnreflecting ourselves,as much as it does reality.,It ends up, I suppose,,inflating our bubblesnrather than bursting them.,And so maybe it's no surprise,that we're in a situation,na paradoxical situation,,of thinking that we know so much more,,and yet not agreeingnon what it is we know. 
 So how are we going to solventhis problem of knowledge polarization?,One obvious tactic is to trynto fix our technology,,to redesign our digital platforms,,so as to make them lessnsusceptible to polarization.,And I'm happy to report,that many smart people at Googlenand Facebook are working on just that.,And these projects are vital.,I think that fixing technologynis obviously really important,,but I don't think technology alone,nfixing it, is going to solve the problem,of knowledge polarization.,I don't think that because I don't think,nat the end of the day,,it is a technological problem.,I think it's a human problem,,having to do with how we thinknand what we value. 
 In order to solve it, I thinknwe're going to need help.,We're going to need helpnfrom psychology and political science.,But we're also going to need help,nI think, from philosophy.,Because to solve the problemnof knowledge polarization,,we're going to need to reconnect,with one fundamental, philosophical idea:,that we live in a common reality.,The idea of a common realitynis like, I suppose,,a lot of philosophical concepts:,easy to state,but mysteriously difficultnto put into practice.,To really accept it,,I think we need to do three things,,each of which is a challenge right now. 
 First, we need to believe in truth.,You might have noticed,that our culture is havingnsomething of a troubled relationship,with that concept right now.,It seems as if we disagree so much that,,as one political commentatornput it not long ago,,it's as if there are no facts anymore.,But that thought is actually an expression,of a sort of seductive linenof argument that's in the air.,It goes like this:,we just can't step outsidenof our own perspectives;,we can't step outside of our biases.,Every time we try,,we just get more informationnfrom our perspective.,So, this line of thought goes,,we might as well admitnthat objective truth is an illusion,,or it doesn't matter,,because either we'll nevernknow what it is,,or it doesn't exist in the first place. 
 That's not a new philosophical thought --,skepticism about truth.,During the end of the last century,nas some of you know,,it was very popular in certainnacademic circles.,But it really goes back all the waynto the Greek philosopher Protagoras,,if not farther back.,Protagoras said that objectiventruth was an illusion,because "man is the measurenof all things.",Man is the measure of all things.,That can seem like a bracing bitnof realpolitik to people,,or liberating,,because it allows each of usnto discover or make our own truth. 
 But actually, I think it's a bitnof self-serving rationalization,disguised as philosophy.,It confuses the difficultynof being certain,with the impossibility of truth.,Look --,of course it's difficultnto be certain about anything;,we might all be living in "The Matrix.",You might have a brain chip in your head,feeding you all the wrong information.,But in practice, we do agreenon all sorts of facts.,We agree that bullets can kill people.,We agree that you can't flapnyour arms and fly.,We agree -- or we should --,that there is an external reality,and ignoring it can get you hurt. 
 Nonetheless, skepticismnabout truth can be tempting,,because it allows us to rationalizenaway our own biases.,When we do that, we're sort of likenthe guy in the movie,who knew he was living in "The Matrix",but decided he liked it there, anyway.,After all, getting what younwant feels good.,Being right all the time feels good.,So, often it's easier for us,to wrap ourselves in our cozyninformation bubbles,,live in bad faith,,and take those bubblesnas the measure of reality. 
 An example, I think, of hownthis bad faith gets into our action,is our reactionnto the phenomenon of fake news.,The fake news that spread on the internet,during the Americannpresidential election of 2016,was designed to feed into our biases,,designed to inflate our bubbles.,But what was really striking about it,was not just that it foolednso many people.,What was really striking to menabout fake news,,the phenomenon,,is how quickly it itself becamenthe subject of knowledge polarization;,so much so, that the very term --nthe very term -- "fake news",now just means: "news story I don't like.",That's an example of the bad faithntowards the truth that I'm talking about. 
 But the really, I think, dangerous thing,about skepticism with regard to truth,is that it leads to despotism.,"Man is the measure of all things",inevitably becomes "The Mannis the measure of all things.",Just as "every man for himself",always seems to turn out to ben"only the strong survive." 
 At the end of Orwell's "1984,",the thought policeman O'Brien is torturingnthe protagonist Winston Smith,into believing two plus two equals five.,What O'Brien says is the point,,is that he wants to convince Smithnthat whatever the party says is the truth,,and the truth is whatever the party says.,And what O'Brien knowsnis that once this thought is accepted,,critical dissent is impossible.,You can't speak truth to power,if the power speaks truth by definition. 
 I said that in order to acceptnthat we really live in a common reality,,we have to do three things.,The first thing is to believe in truth.,The second thing can be summed up,by the Latin phrase that Kant tooknas the motto for the Enlightenment:,"Sapere aude,",or "dare to know.",Or as Kant wants,n"to dare to know for yourself." 
 I think in the early days of the internet,,a lot of us thought,that information technologynwas always going to make it easier,for us to know for ourselves,,and of course in many ways, it has.,But as the internet has becomenmore and more a part of our lives,,our reliance on it, our use of it,,has become often more passive.,Much of what we know today we Google-know.,We download prepackaged sets of facts,and sort of shuffle them alongnthe assembly line of social media.,Now, Google-knowing is useful,precisely because it involvesna sort of intellectual outsourcing.,We offload our effort onto a networknof others and algorithms.,And that allows us, of course,nto not clutter our minds,with all sorts of facts.,We can just download themnwhen we need them.,And that's awesome. 
 But there's a differencenbetween downloading a set of facts,and really understanding how or whynthose facts are as they are.,Understanding whyna particular disease spreads,,or how a mathematical proof works,,or why your friend is depressed,,involves more than just downloading.,It's going to require, most likely,,doing some work for yourself:,having a little creative insight;,using your imagination;,getting out into the field;,doing the experiment;,working through the proof;,talking to someone. 
 Now, I'm not saying, of course,nthat we should stop Google-knowing.,I'm just saying,we shouldn't overvalue it, either.,We need to find ways of encouragingnforms of knowing that are more active,,and don't always involve passing offnour effort into our bubble.,Because the thing about Google-knowingnis that too often it ends up,being bubble-knowing.,And bubble-knowing meansnalways being right.,But daring to know,,daring to understand,,means risking the possibilitynthat you could be wrong.,It means risking the possibility,that what you want and what's truenare different things. 
 Which brings me to the third thingnthat I think we need to do,if we want to accept that we livenin a common reality.,That third thing is:nhave a little humility.,By humility here, I meannepistemic humility,,which means, in a sense,,knowing that you don't know it all.,But it also means somethingnmore than that.,It means seeing your worldviewnas open to improvement,by the evidence and experience of others.,Seeing your worldviewnas open to improvement,by the evidence and experience of others.,That's more than justnbeing open to change.,It's more than just being opennto self-improvement.,It means seeing your knowledgenas capable of enhancing,or being enrichednby what others contribute.,That's part of what is involved,in recognizing there's a common reality,that you, too, are responsible to. 
 I don't think it's muchnof a stretch to say,that our society is not particularly greatnat enhancing or encouraging,that sort of humility.,That's partly because,,well, we tend to confusenarrogance and confidence.,And it's partly because, well, you know,,arrogance is just easier.,It's just easier to think of yourselfnas knowing it all.,It's just easier to think of yourselfnas having it all figured out.,But that's another examplenof the bad faith towards the truth,that I've been talking about. 
 So the concept of a common reality,,like a lot of philosophical concepts,,can seem so obvious,,that we can look right past it,and forget why it's important.,Democracies can't functionnif their citizens don't strive,,at least some of the time,,to inhabit a common space,,a space where they can passnideas back and forth,when -- and especially when --,they disagree.,But you can't strive to inhabit that space,if you don't already acceptnthat you live in the same reality.,To accept that, we've gotnto believe in truth,,we've got to encouragenmore active ways of knowing.,And we've got to have the humility,to realize that we're notnthe measure of all things. 
 We may yet one day realize the vision,of having the internet in our brains.,But if we want that to be liberatingnand not terrifying,,if we want it to expand our understanding,and not just our passive knowing,,we need to remember that our perspectives,,as wondrous, as beautiful as they are,,are just that --,perspectives on one reality. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)If you've been thinking about US politics,and trying to make sense of itnfor the last year or so,,you might have hit on somethingnlike the following three propositions:,one, US partisanshipnhas never been so bad before;,two,,for the first time,nit's geographically spatialized --,we're divided between the coasts,nwhich want to look outwards,,and the center of the country,nwhich wants to look inwards;,and third,,there's nothing we can do about it. 
 I'm here to today to saynthat all three of these propositions,,all of which sound reasonable,,are not true.,In fact,,our US partisanship goes all the way back,to the very beginning of the republic.,It was geographically spatializednin almost eerily the same way,that it is today,,and it often has beennthroughout US history.,And last,,and by far most importantly,,we actually havenan extraordinary mechanism,that's designed to help us managenfactional disagreement and partisanship.,That technology is the Constitution.,And this is an evolving, subtly,nsupplely designed entity,that has the specific purpose,of teaching us how to managenfactional disagreement,where it's possible to do that,,and giving us techniquesnfor overcoming that disagreement,when that's possible. 
 Now, in order to tell you the story,,I want to go backnto a pivotal moment in US history,,and that is the moment,when factional disagreementnand partisanship was born.,There actually was a birth moment --,a moment in US historynwhen partisanship snapped into place.,The person who's at the corenof that story is James Madison.,And at the moment that this began,,James Madison was riding high.,He himself was the Einsteinnof not only the US Constitution,,but of constitutional thoughtnmore globally,,and, to give him his due,,he knew it.,In a period of time of just three years,,from 1785 to 1788,,he had conceived, theorized,ndesigned, passed and gotten ratified,the US Constitution. 
 And just to give younsome sense of the enormity,of what that accomplishment actually was,,although Madisonncouldn't have known it at the time,,today that same constitutional technologynthat he invented is still in use,not only in the US,,but, 230 years later,,in places like Canada,,India,,South Africa,,Brazil.,So in an extraordinary rangenof contexts all over the world,,this technology is still the dominant,,most used, most effective technologynto manage governance. 
 In that moment,,Madison believed that,nhaving solved this problem,,the country would run smoothly,,and that he had designed a technology,that would minimizenthe results of factions,so there would be no political parties.,Remarkably, he thoughtnhe had designed a constitution,that was against political parties,and would make them unnecessary. 
 He had gotten an enormous degree of help,in the final marketing phasenof his constitutional project,from a man you may have heard of,ncalled Alexander Hamilton.,Now, Hamilton was everythingnMadison was not.,He was passionate,nwhere Madison was restrained.,He was pansexual,,where Madison didn't speaknto a woman expect for once,until he was 42 years old,,and then married Dolleynand lived happily ever after for 40 years. 
 (Laughter) 
 To put it bluntly,,Hamilton's the kind of person,about whom you would writena hip-hop musical -- 
 (Laughter) 
 and Madison is the kind of person,about whom you would not writena hip-hop musical. 
 (Laughter) 
 Or indeed, a musical of any kind at all. 
 But together,,they had become a rather unlikely pairing,,and they had producednthe Federalist Papers,,which offered a justification,and, as I mentioned,,a marketing plan for the Constitution,,which had been wildly effectivenand wildly successful. 
 Once the new government was in place,,Hamilton became Secretary of the Treasury,,and he had a very specific idea in mind.,And that was,to do for financial institutionsnand infrastructure,exactly what Madison had donenfor constitutions.,Again, his contemporaries all knew it.,One of them told Madison,,who can't have liked it very much,,that Hamilton was the Newtonnof infrastructure.,The idea was pretty straightforward.,Hamilton would giventhe United States a national bank,,a permanent national debt --,he said it would ben"immortal," his phrase --,and a manufacturing policynthat would enable trade and manufacturing,rather than agriculture,,which was where the country's primarynwealth had historically been. 
 Madison went utterly ballistic.,And in this pivotal, critical decision,,instead of just telling the worldnthat his old friend Hamilton was wrong,and was adopting the wrong policies,,he actually began to argue,that Hamilton's ideasnwere unconstitutional --,that they violated the very naturenof the Constitution,that the two of them had drafted together.,Hamilton respondednthe way you would expect.,He declared Madison to benhis "personal and political enemy" --,these are his words. 
 So these two founders who had beennsuch close friends and such close allies,and such partners,,then began to produce enmity.,And they did it in the good,nold-fashioned way.,First, they founded political parties.,Madison created a party originally callednthe Democratic Republican Party --,"Republican" for short --,and Hamilton created a partyncalled the Federalist Party.,Those two parties adoptednpositions on national politics,that were extreme and exaggerated.,To give you a clear example:,Madison, who had always believed,that the country would havensome manufacturing and some trade,and some agriculture,,began attacking Hamilton,as a kind of tool of the financial markets,whom Hamilton himself intendednto put in charge of the country.,That was an overstatement,,but it was somethingnMadison came to believe. 
 He also attacked city life,,and he said that the coasts were corrupt,,and what people needed to donwas to look inwards,to the center of the country,,to farmers, who were the essencenof Republican virtue,,and they should go back to the valuesnthat had made American great,,specifically the values of the Revolution,,and those were the values of low taxes,,agriculture,and less trade.,Hamilton responded to thisnby saying that Madison was naïve,,that he was childish,,and that his goal wasnto turn the United States,into a primitive autarchy,,self-reliant and completely ineffectualnon the global scale. 
 (Laughter) 
 They both meant it,,and there was some truthnto each of their claims,,because each side was grossly exaggeratingnthe views of the other,in order to fight their war.,They founded newspapers,,and so for the first time in US history,,the news that people receivedncame entirely through the lens,of either the Republicannor the Federalist party. 
 How does this end?,Well, as it turned out,nthe Constitution did its work.,But it did its work in surprising ways,that Madison himselfnhad not fully anticipated.,First, there was a series of elections.,And the first two times out of the box,,the Federalists destroyed the Republicans.,Madison was astonished.,Of course, he blamed the press. 
 (Laughter) 
 And in a rather innovative view --,Madison never failed to innovatenwhen he thought about anything --,he said the reasonnthat the press was so pro-Federalist,is that the advertisersnwere all Federalists,,because they were traders on the coastsnwho got their capital from Britain,,which Federalism was in bed with.,That was his initial explanation.,But despite the fact that the Federalists,,once in power,,actually enacted laws that criminalizedncriticism of the government --,that happened in the United States --,nevertheless,,the Republicans fought back,,and Madison began to emphasizenthe freedom of speech,,which he had builtninto the Bill of Rights,,and the capacity of civil society,to organize.,And sure enough, nationally,,small local groups -- they were callednDemocratic-Republican Societies --,began to form and protestnagainst Federalist-dominated hegemony.,Eventually, the Republicans managednto win a national election --,that was in 1800.,Madison became the Secretary of State,,his friend and mentor Jeffersonnbecame president,,and they actually, over time,,managed to put the Federalistsncompletely out of business.,That was their goal. 
 Now, why did that happen?,It happened because in the structurenof the Constitution,were several featuresnthat actually managed faction,the way there were supposed to donin the first place.,What were those?,One -- most important of all --,the freedom of speech.,This was an innovative idea at the time.,Namely, that if you were out of power,,you could still saynthat the government was terrible. 
 Two,,civil society organization.,The capacity to put togethernprivate groups, individuals,,political parties and others,who would organize to try to bringnabout fundamental change.,Perhaps most significantlynwas the separation of powers --,an extraordinary componentnof the Constitution.,The thing about the separation of powers,is that it did then and it does now,,drive governance to the center.,You can get elected to officenin the United States,with help from the periphery,,right or left.,It turns out,,you actually can't governnunless you bring on board the center.,There are midterm electionsnthat come incredibly fast,after a presidency begins.,Those drive presidents towards the center. 
 There's a structure in whichnthe president, in fact, does not rule,or even govern,,but can only propose lawsnwhich other people have to agree with --,another feature that tendsnto drive presidents,who actually want to get things done,to the center.,And a glance at the newspapers todaynwill reveal to you,that these principles are stillncompletely in operation.,No matter how a president gets elected,,the president cannot get anything done,unless the president first of allnfollows the rules of the Constitution,,because if not,,the courts will stand up,nas indeed has sometimes occurred,,not only recently,nbut in the past, in US history.,And furthermore,,the president needs people,,elected officials who knownthey need to win election,from centrist voters,,also to back his or her policiesnin order to pass laws.,Without it, nothing much happens. 
 The takeaway of this brief excursus,into the history of partisanship,nthen, is the following:,partisanship is real;,it's profound;,it's extraordinarily powerful,,and it's terribly upsetting.,But the design of the Constitutionnis greater than partisanship.,It enables us to manage partisanshipnwhen that's possible,,and it enables us actuallynto overcome partisan division,and produce compromise,,when and only when that is possible.,A technology like thatnis a technology that worked,for the founders,,it worked for their grandchildren,,it didn't work at the momentnof the Civil War,,but then it started working again.,And it worked for our grandparents,,our parents,,and it's going to work for us. 
 (Applause) 
 So what you should do is really simple.,Stand up for what you believe in,,support the organizationsnthat you care about,,speak out on the issuesnthat matter to you,,get involved,,make change,,express you opinion,,and do it with respectnand knowledge and confidence,that it's only by working together,that the constitutional technologyncan do the job that it is designed to do. 
 Stand up for what you believe,,but take a deep breath while you do it.,It's going to be OK. 
 Thanks. 
 (Applause)Today, I'm going to talk about AI and us.,AI researchers have always said,that we humans do not need to worry,,because only menial jobsnwill be taken over by machines.,Is that really true?,They have also saidnthat AI will create new jobs,,so those who lose their jobsnwill find a new one.,Of course.,But the real question is:,How many of thosenwho may lose their jobs to AI,will be able to land a new one,,especially when AI is smart enoughnto learn better than most of us? 
 Let me ask you a question:,How many of you think,that AI will pass the entrance examinationnof a top university by 2020?,Oh, so many. OK.,So some of you may say, "Of course, yes!",Now singularity is the issue.,And some others may say, "Maybe,,because AI already wonnagainst a top Go player.",And others may say, "No, never. Uh-uh.",That means we do not knownthe answer yet, right?,So that was the reason whynI started Todai Robot Project,,making an AI which passesnthe entrance examination,of the University of Tokyo,,the top university in Japan. 
 This is our Todai Robot.,And, of course, the brain of the robotnis working in the remote server.,It is now writing a 600-word essay,on maritime trade in the 17th century.,How does that sound? 
 Why did I take the entrance examnas its benchmark?,Because I thought we had to studynthe performance of AI,in comparison to humans,,especially on the skills and expertise,which are believednto be acquired only by humans,and only through education.,To enter Todai, the University of Tokyo,,you have to passntwo different types of exams.,The first one isna national standardized test,in multiple-choice style.,You have to take seven subjects,and achieve a high score --,I would say like an 84 percentnor more accuracy rate --,to be allowed to takenthe second stage written test,prepared by Todai. 
 So let me first explainnhow modern AI works,,taking the "Jeopardy!" challengenas an example.,Here is a typical "Jeopardy!" question:,"Mozart's last symphonynshares its name with this planet.",Interestingly, a "Jeopardy!"nquestion always asks,,always ends with "this" something:,"this" planet, "this" country,,"this" rock musician, and so on.,In other words, "Jeopardy!" doesn't asknmany different types of questions,,but a single type,,which we call "factoid questions." 
 By the way, do you know the answer?,If you do not know the answernand if you want to know the answer,,what would you do?,You Google, right? Of course.,Why not?,But you have to pick appropriate keywords,like "Mozart," "last"nand "symphony" to search.,The machine basically does the same.,Then this Wikipedia pagenwill be ranked top.,Then the machine reads the page.,No, uh-uh. 
 Unfortunately, none of the modern AIs,,including Watson, Siri and Todai Robot,,is able to read.,But they are very goodnat searching and optimizing.,It will recognize,that the keywords "Mozart,"n"last" and "symphony",are appearing heavily around here.,So if it can find a word which is a planet,and which is co-occurringnwith these keywords,,that must be the answer.,This is how Watson findsnthe answer "Jupiter," in this case. 
 Our Todai Robot works similarly,nbut a bit smarter,in answering history yes-no questions,,like, "'Charlemagne repelled the Magyars.'nIs this sentence true or false?",Our robot starts producingna factoid question,,like: "Charlemagne repelledn[this person type]" by itself.,Then, "Avars" but notn"Magyars" is ranked top.,This sentence is likely to be false.,Our robot does not read,ndoes not understand,,but it is statisticallyncorrect in many cases. 
 For the second stage written test,,it is required to writena 600-word essay like this one: 
 [Discuss the rise and fallnof the maritime trade,in East and Southeast Asianin the 17th century ...] 
 and as I have shown earlier,,our robot took the sentencesnfrom the textbooks and Wikipedia,,combined them together,,and optimized it to produce an essay,without understanding a thing. 
 (Laughter) 
 But surprisingly, it wrote a better essay,than most of the students. 
 (Laughter) 
 How about mathematics?,A fully automatic math-solving machine,has been a dream,since the birth of the wordn"artificial intelligence,",but it has stayed at the levelnof arithmetic for a long, long time.,Last year, we finally succeedednin developing a system,which solved pre-university-levelnproblems from end to end,,like this one.,This is the original problemnwritten in Japanese,,and we had to teach itn2,000 mathematical axioms,and 8,000 Japanese words,to make it accept the problemsnwritten in natural language.,And it is now translatingnthe original problems,into machine-readable formulas.,Weird, but it is now readynto solve it, I think.,Go and solve it.,Yes! It is now executingnsymbolic computation.,Even more weird,,but probably this is the mostnfun part for the machine. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now it outputs a perfect answer,,though its proof is impossible to read,neven for mathematicians.,Anyway, last year our robotnwas among the top one percent,in the second stage writtennexam in mathematics. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 So, did it enter Todai?,No, not as I expected.,Why?,Because it doesn't understand any meaning.,Let me show you a typical errornit made in the English test. 
 [Nate: We're almost at the bookstore.nJust a few more minutes.,Sunil: Wait. \_\_\_\_\_\_ .nNate: Thank you! That always happens ...] 
 Two people are talking.,For us, who can understandnthe situation -- 
 [1. "We walked for a long time."n2. "We're almost there.",3. "Your shoes look expensive."n4. "Your shoelace is untied."] 
 it is obvious number fournis the correct answer, right?,But Todai Robot chose number two,,even after learning 15 billionnEnglish sentences,using deep learning technologies.,OK, so now you mightnunderstand what I said:,modern AIs do not read,,do not understand.,They only disguise as if they do. 
 This is the distribution graph,of half a million studentsnwho took the same exam as Todai Robot.,Now our Todai Robotnis among the top 20 percent,,and it was capable to pass,more than 60 percentnof the universities in Japan --,but not Todai.,But see how it is beyond the volume zone,of to-be white-collar workers. 
 You might think I was delighted.,After all, my robot was surpassingnstudents everywhere.,Instead, I was alarmed.,How on earth could this unintelligentnmachine outperform students --,our children?,Right?,I decided to investigatenwhat was going on in the human world.,I took hundreds of sentencesnfrom high school textbooks,and made easy multiple-choice quizzes,,and asked thousandsnof high school students to answer. 
 Here is an example: 
 [Buddhism spread to ... ,nChristianity to ... and Oceania,,and Islam to ...] 
 Of course, the original problemsnare written in Japanese,,their mother tongue. 
 [ \_\_\_\_\_\_ has spread to Oceania.,1. Hinduism 2. Christianityn3. Islam 4. Buddhism ] 
 Obviously, Christianitynis the answer, isn't it?,It's written!,And Todai Robot chosenthe correct answer, too.,But one-third of juniornhigh school students,failed to answer this question.,Do you think it is only the case in Japan?,I do not think so,,because Japan is always rankednamong the top in OECD PISA tests,,measuring 15-year-oldnstudents' performance in mathematics,,science and reading,every three years. 
 We have been believing,that everybody can learn,and learn well,,as long as we providengood learning materials,free on the web,so that they can accessnthrough the internet.,But such wonderful materialsnmay benefit only those who can read well,,and the percentagenof those who can read well,may be much less than we expected.,How we humans will coexist with AI,is something we havento think about carefully,,based on solid evidence.,At the same time,nwe have to think in a hurry,because time is running out. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: Noriko, thank you. 
 Noriko Arai: Thank you. 
 CA: In your talk, you so beautifullyngive us a sense of how AIs think,,what they can do amazingly,and what they can't do.,But -- do I read you right,,that you think we really neednquite an urgent revolution in education,to help kids do the thingsnthat humans can do better than AIs? 
 NA: Yes, yes, yes.,Because we humansncan understand the meaning.,That is somethingnwhich is very, very lacking in AI.,But most of the studentsnjust pack the knowledge,without understandingnthe meaning of the knowledge,,so that is not knowledge,nthat is just memorizing,,and AI can do the same thing.,So we have to think aboutna new type of education. 
 CA: A shift from knowledge,nrote knowledge, to meaning. 
 NA: Mm-hmm. 
 CA: Well, there's a challengenfor the educators. Thank you so much. 
 NA: Thank you very much. Thank you.

 Damian Kulash:nThank you, thanks very much. 
 We are OK Go,,and we've been togethernas a band since 1998.,But in the last decade,,we've become known as muchnfor the elaborate music videos,,like the one we just saw,,as for the songs they accompany.,So we will play along with anothernone of those in a few minutes,,but in the meantime,,we want to address this questionnthat we get asked all the time,but we've really never come upnwith an adequate answer for it,,and that is, how do wenthink of those ideas? 
 The videos are not allnRube Goldberg machines, by the way.,Last year we did a dance in zero gravity,,and once we set up an obstacle course,out of thousands of musicalninstruments in the desert,,and then played themnby stunt driving a car through them. 
 (Laughter) 
 For one of the videos,,we choreographednhundreds of people with umbrellas,in an abandoned parking lot outside Tokyo,,and then filmed them from a dronena half a mile in the air. 
 So it's all of these ideasnthat people are curious about,,and the reason we've had so much troublendescribing how we think of these ideas,is that it doesn't really feelnlike we think of them at all.,It feels like we find them.,And by way of explanation --,well, I have a compulsive habit.,I play parallax and perspective gamesnwith my eyes pretty much all the time,,and it's something I've been doingnsince I was a teenager.,And I think the big contributingnfactor may have been,that this is how I decoratednmy high school bedroom. 
 (Laughter) 
 And being a teenager,,what I did in there, of course,nwas just talk on the phone,for staggering amounts of time.,So I was in this visual maelstrom,just pretty muchnusually sitting in one place,,and I guess justnthe overload in general --,my brain kind of triednto make sense of it, and I would --,If I could move my head offnto one side a little bit,,the edge of the desknwould line up just perfectly,with that poster on the opposite wall;,or if I put my thumb out,,I could close first my left eyenand then my right,,and my thumb would bounce back and forth,between Jimi Hendrix'snleft eye and his right. 
 (Laughter) 
 It was not a conscious thing, of course,,this is just kind of the equivalentnof doodling while you're talking,,and it's still somethingnI do all the time.,This is my wife, Kristin -- 
 (Applause) 
 Yeah!,Woo! 
 And it's not uncommonnthat we are out at dinner,,and in the middle of a great conversationnshe'll just stop mid-sentence,,and when she stops is when I realizenthat I'm the one who's acting weird,because I'm like bobbing and weaving.,And what I'm trying to donis get that ficus back there,to stick out of her head like a ponytail. 
 (Laughter) 
 The point of telling younall this is that --,for me this is what it feels likento have an idea.,It's like they're madenof these disparate parts,,these disparate chunksnsort of floating out there.,And if you're receptivenand you're observant,,and crucially, if you'renin exactly the right place,,you can get them to just line up. 
 So if you get used to --,if it's your jobnto think of ideas this way,,they'll start beckoning to you,the way that Jimi's eyesnbeckoned from that poster,,or the ficus beckonsnfrom behind Kristin's head.,Writing music feels like that processnjust over and over again,,like you've got a bunch of soundsnor a groove or a chord progression,and you're just lookingnfor that thing on the other side,,that little chunk over there,nthat puzzle piece that clicks right in.,And when it does click,,it doesn't feel like younthought up that puzzle piece,,it feels like you found it --,like it was a set of relationshipsnthat you unlocked. 
 But with the videos in particular,,we're usually lookingnfor this specific feeling,which is wonder.,And there's always a componentnof surprise to wonder,,so we're not just looking for good ideas,,we're looking for good ideasnthat surprise us in some way.,And this causes something of a problem,,because ...,the process that we all use to make stuff,,it actually has a very strong biasnagainst surprising ideas. 
 The process I'm talking aboutnis the one you all know --,we all do it all the time.,You think of an idea.,You just sit and thinknof your brilliant idea,and then you come up with a plan,for how you're going to makenthat idea happen.,And then with that plan in mind,,you go back and double-checknyour original idea,and maybe revise it,,and then bouncing back and forthnbetween the idea and the plan,,the plan and the idea,,eventually you come upnwith a truly great plan.,And then once you have that,nand only then,,do you go out and you execute.,And this is like --,this is sort of a flawless system,in terms of maximizing your resources,,because this -- super cheap.,Thinking usually costs very little,,but this is really expensivenmost of the time,,so by the time you get there,,you want to make surenyou're super prepared,and you can squeeze every last dropnout of what you've got. 
 But there are problems with this,,and math will help usnreveal the biggest one.,Go back to that videonthat we just showed you.,That Rube Goldberg machine,,it had about 130 interactions in it.,That was 130 things,that we had to have gonaccording to our plan.,So let's assume that we wantnto make a new video now,,similarly complex -- 130 moving parts.,If we're really good plannersnin that system,,it seems like maybenwe could be good enough,to get every part of that systemnto be 90 percent reliable.,90 percent sounds good, right?,Well, it's not.,It's terrible actually.nThe numbers say so.,The chance of getting all 130 thingsnto not fail at the same time,is .9 for 90 percent to the 130th power.,So calculate that out and you get ... 
 (Ding) 
 .000001,,which is one ten-thousandthnof one percent,,so your chance for successnis literally one in a million. 
 (Whistle) 
 (Laughter) 
 I mean that's not a gamble I want to take,,so let's ratchet upnthat reliability to 99 percent.,.99 to the 130th power is ... 
 (Ding) 
 .27 -- 27 percent.,Significantly less daunting --,like this might even be usable.,But really think about that.,How many parts of your livesnare 99 percent reliable?,And could you really get 130 of themnall in one place at once?,And if you really could,,doesn't it seemnlike you deserve to succeed?,Like that is --,that thing is going to work, right?,But no, it actually fails three timesnmore often than it succeeds. 
 So the upshot of all this,is that if your projectnis pretty complex --,like, you know,nevery ambitious project is --,if you've got a lot of moving parts,,you're basically constrainednto just reshuffling ideas,that have already demonstrablynproven that they're 100 percent reliable.,So now go back to me sittingnwith my thumb in the air,trying to line up something surprising.,If the only things I'm allowednto consider in the first place,are ideas that have already been donenover and over and over again,,I am screwed.,However, there are ways around this,,because we all know that there arentons of untried ideas still out there,,and plenty of them will turn outnto be every bit as reliable as we need,,it's just that we don't yet knownthey are reliable,when we are at this planning phase. 
 So what we do is we trynto identify some place,where there might just bena ton of those untried ideas.,We try to find a sandbox,and then we gamblena whole bunch of our resources,on getting in that sandbox and playing. 
 (Laughter) 
 Because we have to trustnthat it's the process in the sandbox,that will reveal to usnwhich ideas are not only surprising,,but surprisingly reliable. 
 So some of the sandboxesnthat we've started videos with.,Let's play with optical illusions.,Let's try to dance on moving surfaces.,Let's try to make toastnwith a laser cutter.,Or let's do something in onenof those zero-gravity airplanes.,But then insteadnof actually trying to sit there,and think out what that something is,,we spent a full third of our budgetngetting in an actual Vomit Comet,and bouncing off the walls for a week. 
 So this may seem to you like testing,,but it really isn't,,because at this pointnwe don't yet know what our idea is,,we don't have a plan to be testing.,So we're just --,we're just playing,,we're just trying everythingnwe can think of,,because we need to get this idea spacenfilled up with a chaos,like the one in my high school bedroom.,Because then, if we canndo the bob and weave thing,,if we can put our thumbs upnand get just a few things to line up -- 
 (Ding) 
 chances are no one else has ever madenthose same things line up before.,And when we're done with that project,,people will ask us againnhow we thought of that idea,,and we'll be stumped,nbecause from our perspective,,it doesn't feel likenwe thought of it at all,,it just feels like we found it. 
 So we'll play another video for you nownand the song along with it.,This is for the song "The One Moment,",and for this one,nthe sandbox was ballistics and math.,So I spent a full month putting togetherna giant spreadsheet for this.,It was like my playspacenwas 400 lines long,and 25 columns wide --,which I presume that if anybody is goingnto understand that, it's this crowd. 
 (Laughter) 
 Nothing is betternthan a giant spreadsheet, right? 
 (Laughter) 
 Well, thank you everyone, very much.,We are OK Go,,and this is called "The One Moment." 
 (Applause) 
 [The One Moment] 
 (Explosions) 
 [What you just saw was real,and it took 4.2 seconds]

 (Singing) You're right, 
 there's nothing more lovely, 
 there's nothing more profound,than the certainty, 
 than the certaintynthat all of this will end 
 That all of this will end 
 So open your arms to me, 
 open your arms to me

 (Singing) So while the mudnreclaims our footprints, 
 and while our bones keep looking back 
 at the overgrowthnthat's swallowing the path --

 So won't you stay here with me 
 and we'll buildn'til we've blistered our hands 
 So won't you stay here with menand we'll build us some temples, 
 build us some castles, 
 build us some monuments 
 and burn them all right down

 (Guitar) 
 (Applause)So, let me add to the complexity,of the situation we find ourselves in.,At the same time that we're solvingnfor climate change,,we're going to be building citiesnfor three billion people.,That's a doublingnof the urban environment.,If we don't get that right,,I'm not sure all the climate solutionsnin the world will save mankind,,because so much dependsnon how we shape our cities:,not just environmental impacts,,but our social well-being,,our economic vitality,,our sense of community and connectedness. 
 Fundamentally, the way we shape citiesnis a manifestation,of the kind of humanity we bring to bear.,And so getting it right is, I think,,the order of the day.,And to a certain degree, getting it rightncan help us solve climate change,,because in the end,,it's our behavior that seemsnto be driving the problem.,The problem isn't free-floating,,and it isn't just ExxonMobilnand oil companies.,It's us; how we live.,How we live. 
 There's a villain in this story.,It's called sprawl,nand I'll be upfront about that.,But it's not just the kind of sprawlnyou think of, or many people think of,,as low-density development,out at the peripherynof the metropolitan area.,Actually, I think sprawl can happennanywhere, at any density.,The key attributenis that it isolates people.,It segregates peopleninto economic enclaves,and land-use enclaves.,It separates them from nature.,It doesn't allow the cross-fertilization,,the interaction,,that make cities great places,and that make society thrive.,So the antidote to sprawl is reallynwhat we all need to be thinking about,,especially when we're taking onnthis massive construction project. 
 So let me take you through one exercise.,We developed the modelnfor the state of California,so they could get onnwith reducing carbon emissions.,We did a whole series of scenariosnfor how the state could grow,,and this is just onenoverly simplified one.,We mixed different development prototypes,and said they're going to carry usnthrough the year 2050,,10 million new crewnin our state of California.,And one was sprawl.,It's just more of the same:nshopping malls, subdivisions,,office parks.,The other one was dominated by,nnot everybody moving to the city,,but just compact development,,what we used to think ofnas streetcar suburbs,,walkable neighborhoods,,low-rise, but integrated,nmixed-used environments.,And the results are astounding.,They're astounding not justnfor the scale of the difference,of this one shiftnin our city-making habit,but also because each one representsna special interest group,,a special interest groupnthat used to advocate for their concerns,one at a time.,They did not see the, what I call,n"co-benefits" of urban form,that allows them to join with others. 
 So, land consumption:,environmentalists are reallynconcerned about this,,so are farmers;,there's a whole range of people,,and, of course, neighborhood groupsnthat want open space nearby.,The sprawl version of California,almost doubles the urbannphysical footprint. 
 Greenhouse gas: tremendous savings,,because in California, our biggestncarbon emission comes from cars,,and cities that don't dependnon cars as much,obviously create huge savings. 
 Vehicle miles traveled:nthat's what I was just talking about.,Just reducing the average 10,000 milesnper household per year,,from somewherenin the mid-26,000 per household,,has a huge impactnnot just on air quality and carbon,but also on the household pocketbook.,It's very expensive to drive that much,,and as we've seen,,the middle class is struggling to hold on. 
 Health care: we were talking aboutnhow do you fix it once we broke it --,clean the air.,Why not just stop polluting?,Why not just use our feet and bikes more?,And that's a function of the kindsnof cities that we shape. 
 Household costs:,2008 was a mark in time,,not of just the financialnindustry running amok.,It was that we were trying to sellntoo many of the wrong kind of housing:,large lot, single family, distant,,too expensive for the averagenmiddle-class family to afford,and, quite frankly, not a good fitnto their lifestyle anymore.,But in order to move inventory,,you can discount the financingnand get it sold.,I think that's a lot of what happened.,Reducing cost by 10,000 dollars --,remember, in Californianthe median is 50,000 --,this is a big element.,That's just cars and utility costs.,So the affordable housing advocates,nwho often sit off in their silos,separate from the environmentalists,nseparate from the politicians,,everybody fighting with everyone,,now begin to see common cause,,and I think the common causenis what really brings about the change. 
 Los Angeles, as a result of these efforts,,has now decided to transform itself,into a more transit-oriented environment.,As a matter of fact, since '08,,they've voted in 400 billion dollarsnof bonds for transit,and zero dollars for new highways.,What a transformation:,LA becomes a city of walkers and transit,,not a city of cars. 
 (Applause) 
 How does it happen?,You take the leastndesirable land, the strip,,you add where there's space, transit,and then you infill mixed-use development,,you satisfy new housing demands,and you make the existing neighborhoods,all around it more complex,,more interesting, more walkable. 
 Here's another kind of sprawl:,China, high-density sprawl,nwhat you think of as an oxymoron,,but the same problems,neverything isolated in superblocks,,and of course this amazing smognthat was just spoken to.,Twelve percent of GDPnin China now is spent,on the health impacts of that.,The history, of course,nof Chinese cities is robust.,It's like any other place.,Community was all about small, local shops,and local services and walking,ninteracting with your neighbors.,It may sound utopian, but it's not.,It's actually what people really want.,The new superblocks --,these are blocks that would haven5,000 units in them,,and they're gated as well,nbecause nobody knows anybody else.,And of course, there isn't evenna sidewalk, no ground floor shops --,a very sterile environment.,I found this one casenhere in one of the superblocks,where people had illicitly set upnshops in their garages,so that they could have that kindnof local service economy.,The desire of peoplento get it right is there.,We just have to get the plannersnon board and the politicians. 
 All right. Some technical planning stuff.,Chongqing is a city of 30 million people.,It's almost as big as California.,This is a small growth area.,They wanted us to testnthe alternative to sprawl,in several cities across China.,This is for four-and-a-halfnmillion people.,What the takeaway from this image is,,every one of those circlesnis a walking radius,around a transit station --,massive investment in metro and BRT,,and a distribution that allows everybody,to work within walking distance of that. 
 The red area, this is a blow-up.,All of a sudden, our principlesncalled for green space,preserving the importantnecological features.,And then those other streets in therenare auto-free streets.,So instead of bulldozing,nleveling the site,and building right up to the river,,this green edge was somethingnthat really wasn't normative in China,until these set of practices,began experimentation there.,The urban fabric, small blocks,,maybe 500 families per block.,They know each other.,The street perimeter has shops,so there's local destinations.,And the streets themselves become smaller,,because there are more of them.,Very simple,,straightforward urban design. 
 Now, here you have somethingnI dearly love.,Think of the logic.,If only a third of the people have cars,,why do we give 100 percentnof our streets to cars?,What if we gave 70 percent of the streets,to car-free, to everybody else,,so that the transitncould move well for them,,so that they could walk,nso they could bike? 
 Why not have -- 
 (Applause) 
 geographic equity,in our circulation system?,And quite frankly,ncities would function better.,No matter what they do,,no matter how many ring roadsnthey build in Beijing,,they just can't overcomencomplete gridlock.,So this is an auto-free street,nmixed use along the edge.,It has transit running down the middle.,I'm happy to make that transitnautonomous vehicles,,but maybe I'll have a chancento talk about that later. 
 So there are seven principlesnthat have now been adopted,by the highest levelsnin the Chinese government,,and they're moving to implement them.,And they're simple,,and they are globally,nI think, universal principles.,One is to preserventhe natural environment, the history,and the critical agriculture. 
 Second is mix.,Mixed use is popular,nbut when I say mixed,,I mean mixed incomes, mixed age groups,as well as mixed-land use. 
 Walk.,There's no great citynthat you don't enjoy walking in.,You don't go there.,The places you go on vacationnare places you can walk.,Why not make it everywhere? 
 Bike is the most efficientnmeans of transportation we know.,China has now adopted policiesnthat put six meters of bike lane,on every street.,They're serious about getting backnto their biking history. 
 (Applause) 
 Complicated planner-ese here:,connect.,It's a street networknthat allows many routes,instead of singular routes,and provides many kinds of streetsninstead of just one. 
 Ride.,We have to invest more in transit.,There's no silver bullet.,Autonomous vehicles are notngoing to solve this for us.,As a matter of fact, they're goingnto generate more traffic, more VMT,,than the alternative. 
 And focus.,We have a hierarchy of the citynbased on transit,rather than the old armature of freeways.,It's a big paradigm shift,,but those two thingsnhave to get reconnected,in ways that really shapenthe structure of the city.,So I'm very hopeful.,In California, the United States, China --nthese changes are well accepted. 
 I'm hopeful for two reasons.,One is, most people get it.,They understand intrinsically,what a great city can and should be.,The second is that the kind of analysisnwe can bring to bear now,allows people to connect the dots,,allows people to shapenpolitical coalitions,that didn't exist in the past.,That allows them to bring into beingnthe kinds of communities we all need. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: So, OK:nautonomous driving, self-driving cars.,A lot of people herenare very excited about them.,What are your concernsnor issues about them? 
 Peter Calthorpe: Well, I thinknthere's almost too much hype here.,First is, everybody saysnwe're going to get rid of a lot of cars.,What they don't say is you're goingnto get a lot more vehicle miles.,You're going to get a lot morencars moving on streets.,There will be more congestion. 
 CA: Because they're so appealing --,you can drive while reading or sleeping. 
 PC: Well, a couple of reasons.,One is, if they're privately owned,npeople will travel greater distances.,It'll be a new lease on life to sprawl.,If you can work on your way to work,,you can live in more remote locations.,It'll revitalize sprawl,in a way that I'm deeply frightened.,Taxis:,about 50 percent of the surveys saynthat people won't share them.,If they don't share them,,you can end up with a 90 percentnincrease in vehicle miles traveled.,If you share them,,you're still at aroundna 30 percent increase in VMT. 
 CA: Sharing them, meaningnhaving multiple people riding at once,in some sort of intelligent ride-sharing? 
 PC: Yeah, so the Uber sharenwithout a steering wheel.,The reality is, the efficiencynof vehicles -- you can do it,with or without a steering wheel,nit doesn't matter.,They claim they're the only onesnthat are going to be efficient electric,,but that's not true.,But the real bottom linenis that walking, biking and transit,are the way cities and communities thrive.,And putting peoplenin their private bubbles,,whether they have a steering wheel or not,,is the wrong direction.,And quite frankly,,the image of an AV on its waynto McDonald's to pick up a pack,without its owner,,just being sent off on thesenkind of random errands,is really frightening to me. 
 CA: Well, thank you for that,nand I have to say, the images you showed,of those mixed-use streetsnwere really inspiring, really beautiful. 
 PC: Thank you.nCA: Thank you for your work. 
 (Applause)"Robam kbach boran,",or the art of Khmer classical dance,,is more than 1,000 years old.,It was developed as a prayer in movement,for rain and fertility,,and a prosperity that this meantnfor an agricultural society.,Dancers who were both men and women,were offered to temples,where they served as living bridgesnbetween heaven and earth.,Their dancing bodies carried the prayersnof the people up to the gods,,and the will of the deitiesnwas delivered back through them,to the people and the land. 
 There are a lot of curves in Khmer dance.,Our backs are arched,,our knees are bent,,our toes are curled,,our elbows are hyperflexed,and our fingers are curved backwards.,All of these curvesncreate a serpentine impression,,and this is important because beforenthe introduction of major religions,,Khmers, and people all over the worldnpracticed animism.,Serpents were especially importantnin this belief system,because in their fluid,ncurvilinear movement,,they mimicked the flow of water.,So to invoke the serpentnin your dancing body then,was to conjure the imagenof rivers cutting across the earth:,inspire the flow of life-giving waters. 
 As you can see then,,Khmer classical dancenis a transformation of nature,,of both the physical world around usnand of our own internal universe.,We have four primarynhand gestures that we use.,Can we do them together?,Yeah? OK. 
 This is a tree.,That tree will grow,,and then it will have leaves.,After it has leaves,,it'll have flowers,,and after it has flowers,,it'll have fruit.,That fruit will drop,and a new tree will grow.,And in those four gestures,is the cycle of life. 
 These four gestures are then used,to create a whole entire languagenwith which dancers express themselves.,So for example,,I can say,,"I.","I.",In dance that would be ...,"I.",Or I can say ...,"Hey you, come here, come here.",In dance ...,"Come here,",or, "Go, go." 
 (Laughter) 
 "Go.",And everything from ...,love ...,to sadness,,to -- 
 (Stomping) 
 anger,can be expressednthrough the dance as well. 
 There's a certain magic,in the way that things are filtered,ntransformed and put together,to create limitless possibilities in art.,The Khmer word for art,,silapak,,in fact, at its root, means "magic.",The artist --,the silapakar,,or the silapakarani, then,,is nothing short of a magician.,I am very proud to say,that I belong to a long line of magicians,,from my teacher, Sophiline Cheam Shapiro,,to her teachers who were starsnin the royal palace,,to the ancient dancers of Angkor,and to the primal villagers,from which the art formnoriginally took life. 
 That said,,our cherished heritage was oncenalmost completely destroyed.,If you are wearing glasses,,please stand up.,If you speak more than one language,,please stand up.,If you have light skin,,please stand up.,Your glasses meantnthat you could afford health care.,That second or third language you spokenindicated your elite education.,Your light skin meantnyou didn't have to work beneath the sun.,Under the Khmer Rouge,,who took over Cambodia from 1975 to 1979,,we would all be dead now,,targeted because of our assumed privilege.,You see,,the Khmer Rouge looked to Cambodia,,and they saw centuriesnof rigid inequality.,The king and the few elites around him,had all the pleasuresnand comforts of the world,while the mass majoritynsuffered from backbreaking labor,and harsh poverty.,You don't need a history booknto see that this is true. 
 The Khmer word for "I,",for "me,",is khnhom.,This very same word can also mean "slave",and dancers were in fact knownnas knhom preah robam,,or "slaves of the sacred dance.",The Khmer Rouge soughtnto end slavery in Cambodia,,yet somehow they turnedneveryone into slaves to do it.,They became the oppressionnthat they sought to end.,They evacuated the capital,and forced people into labor camps.,They tore families apart,and brainwashed childrennagainst their own parents.,Everywhere, people were dyingnand being killed,,losing their lives from disease,,overwork,,execution and starvation.,The result of this is that an entire thirdnof Cambodia's population was lost,in less than four years,,and in that number were 90 percentnof Khmer dance artists.,In other words,,nine out of 10 visionsnfor the tradition and future were lost. 
 Thankfully, however,,it was my teacher's teachers,,Chea Samy, Soth Sam On and Chheng Phon,,who would lead the revival of the art form,from the ashes of war and genocide:,one student,,one gesture,,one dance at a time.,They wrote the love,,magic,,beauty,,history and philosophy of our lineage,into the bodies of the next generation. 
 Nearly 40 years later,,Khmer classical dancenhas been revived to new heights.,Yet somehow it still existsnin a vulnerable environment.,The disastrous effects of warnstill haunt Khmer people today.,It is written in our bodies,,manifested in a genetic passage of PTSD,and in families facing cyclical poverty,and immense cultural riftsnand language barriers. 
 Yet beauty is a most resilient thing.,Beauty has this abilitynto grow anywhere and everywhere,at any time.,Beauty is what connects peoplenthrough time and place.,Beauty is a liberation from suffering.,As Khmer artists work to revivenour culture and country,,we find that there are many pathsnin which to move forward into the future.,And in a tradition where we oftenndon't know the dancer's names,,who they were,,what their lives were like,,what they felt,,let me propose that we move forwardnhonestly and openly from "khnhom.",Khnhom not as in slave,,but as in conscious service.,Khnhom:,"I,","me,","flowering." 
 My name is Prumsodun Ok.,I am Khmer,,and I am American.,I am the child of refugees,,a creator, a healer,,and a builder of bridges.,I am my teacher's first male student,in a tradition understoodnby many as female,,and I founded Cambodia's firstngay dance company.,I am the incarnationnof the beauty, dreams and power,of those who came before me.,The convergencenof past, present and future,,and of individual and collective. 
 Let me then playnthat ancient and ageless role,of the artist as messenger,,by sharing the words of Chheng Phon,"A garden with only one type of flower,,or flowers of only one color,,is no good.",This is a reminder that our strength,,growth,,survival,and very existence,,lies in diversity.,It is, however,,a message of courage as well.,For a flower does not asknfor anyone's permission to bloom.,It was born to offer itself to the world.,Fearless love is its nature. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)"These are the times,",said Thomas Paine,,"that try men's souls.",And they're trying ours now. 
 This is a fateful momentnin the history of the West.,We've seen divisive electionsnand divided societies.,We've seen a growth of extremism,in politics and religion,,all of it fueled by anxiety,nuncertainty and fear,,of a world that's changingnalmost faster than we can bear,,and the sure knowledgenthat it's going to change faster still.,I have a friend in Washington.,I asked him, what was it likenbeing in America,during the recent presidential election?,He said to me, "Well,,it was like the man,sitting on the deck of the Titanic,with a glass of whiskey in his hand,and he's saying,n'I know I asked for ice -- 
 (Laughter) 
 but this is ridiculous.'" 
 So is there something we can do,,each of us,,to be able to facenthe future without fear?,I think there is.,And one way into it is to see,that perhaps the most simple wayninto a culture and into an age,is to ask: What do people worship?,People have worshippednso many different things --,the sun, the stars, the storm.,Some people worship many gods,nsome one, some none.,In the 19th and 20th centuries,,people worshipped the nation,,the Aryan race, the communist state.,What do we worship?,I think future anthropologists,will take a look at the books we read,on self-help, self-realization,,self-esteem.,They'll look at the waynwe talk about morality,as being true to oneself,,the way we talk about politics,as a matter of individual rights,,and they'll look at this wonderfulnnew religious ritual we have created.,You know the one?,Called the "selfie.",And I think they'll concludenthat what we worship in our time,is the self, the me, the I. 
 And this is great.,It's liberating.nIt's empowering. It's wonderful.,But don't forget that biologically,nwe're social animals.,We've spent mostnof our evolutionary history,in small groups.,We need those face-to-face interactions,where we learnnthe choreography of altruism,and where we create those spiritual goods,like friendship and trustnand loyalty and love,that redeem our solitude.,When we have too much of the "I"nand too little of the "we,",we can find ourselves vulnerable,,fearful and alone.,It was no accidentnthat Sherry Turkle of MIT,called the book she wrotenon the impact of social media,"Alone Together." 
 So I think the simplest waynof safeguarding the future "you",is to strengthen the future "us",in three dimensions:,the us of relationship,,the us of identity,and the us of responsibility. 
 So let me firstntake the us of relationship.,And here, forgive me if I get personal.,Once upon a time,,a very long time ago,,I was a 20-year-old undergraduate,studying philosophy.,I was into Nietzsche and Schopenhauernand Sartre and Camus.,I was full of ontological uncertainty,and existential angst.,It was terrific. 
 (Laughter) 
 I was self-obsessednand thoroughly unpleasant to know,,until one day I saw,across the courtyard,a girl,who was everything that I wasn't.,She radiated sunshine.,She emanated joy.,I found out her name was Elaine.,We met. We talked.,We married.,And 47 years, three childrennand eight grandchildren later,,I can safely say,it was the best decisionnI ever took in my life,,because it's the people not like us,that make us grow.,And that is why I think,we have to do just that. 
 The trouble with Google filters,,Facebook friends,and reading the news by narrowcastingnrather than broadcasting,means that we're surroundednalmost entirely by people like us,whose views, whose opinions,nwhose prejudices, even,,are just like ours.,And Cass Sunstein of Harvard has shown,that if we surround ourselvesnwith people with the same views as us,,we get more extreme.,I think we need to renewnthose face-to-face encounters,with the people not like us.,I think we need to do that,in order to realizenthat we can disagree strongly,and yet still stay friends.,It's in those face-to-face encounters,that we discovernthat the people not like us,are just people, like us.,And actually, every time,we hold out the hand of friendship,to somebody not like us,,whose class or creednor color are different from ours,,we heal,one of the fractures,of our wounded world.,That is the us of relationship. 
 Second is the us of identity.,Let me give you a thought experiment.,Have you been to Washington?nHave you seen the memorials?,Absolutely fascinating.,There's the Lincoln Memorial:,Gettysburg Address on one side,nSecond Inaugural on the other.,You go to the Jefferson Memorial,,screeds of text.,Martin Luther King Memorial,,more than a dozen quotesnfrom his speeches.,I didn't realize,nin America you read memorials.,Now go to the equivalentnin London in Parliament Square,and you will see that the monumentnto David Lloyd George,contains three words:,David Lloyd George. 
 (Laughter) 
 Nelson Mandela gets two.,Churchill gets just one:,Churchill. 
 (Laughter) 
 Why the difference?nI'll tell you why the difference.,Because America was from the outsetna nation of wave after wave of immigrants,,so it had to create an identity,which it did by telling a story,which you learned at school,nyou read on memorials,and you heard repeatednin presidential inaugural addresses.,Britain until recentlynwasn't a nation of immigrants,,so it could take identity for granted.,The trouble is now,that two things have happenednwhich shouldn't have happened together.,The first thing is in the Westnwe've stopped telling this story,of who we are and why,,even in America.,And at the same time,,immigration is highernthan it's ever been before.,So when you tell a storynand your identity is strong,,you can welcome the stranger,,but when you stop telling the story,,your identity gets weak,and you feel threatened by the stranger.,And that's bad. 
 I tell you, Jews have been scatterednand dispersed and exiled for 2,000 years.,We never lost our identity.,Why? Because at least once a year,,on the festival of Passover,,we told our storynand we taught it to our children,and we ate the unleavenednbread of affliction,and tasted the bitter herbs of slavery.,So we never lost our identity.,I think collectively,we've got to get backnto telling our story,,who we are, where we came from,,what ideals by which we live.,And if that happens,,we will become strong enough,to welcome the stranger and say,,"Come and share our lives,,share our stories,,share our aspirations and dreams.",That is the us of identity. 
 And finally, the us of responsibility.,Do you know something?,My favorite phrase in all of politics,,very American phrase,,is: "We the people.",Why "we the people?",Because it says that we allnshare collective responsibility,for our collective future.,And that's how thingsnreally are and should be. 
 Have you noticed how magical thinking,has taken over our politics?,So we say, all you've got to donis elect this strong leader,and he or she will solvenall our problems for us.,Believe me, that is magical thinking.,And then we get the extremes:,the far right, the far left,,the extreme religiousnand the extreme anti-religious,,the far right dreamingnof a golden age that never was,,the far left dreamingnof a utopia that never will be,and the religious and anti-religiousnequally convinced,that all it takes is Godnor the absence of God,to save us from ourselves.,That, too, is magical thinking,,because the only peoplenwho will save us from ourselves,is we the people,,all of us together.,And when we do that,,and when we move from the politics of me,to the politics of all of us together,,we rediscover those beautiful,ncounterintuitive truths:,that a nation is strong,when it cares for the weak,,that it becomes rich,when it cares for the poor,,it becomes invulnerablenwhen it cares about the vulnerable.,That is what makes great nations. 
 (Applause) 
 So here is my simple suggestion.,It might just change your life,,and it might just helpnto begin to change the world.,Do a search and replace operation,on the text of your mind,,and wherever you encounternthe word "self,",substitute the word "other.",So instead of self-help, other-help;,instead of self-esteem, other-esteem.,And if you do that,,you will begin to feel the power,of what for me is onenof the most moving sentences,in all of religious literature.,"Though I walk through the valleynof the shadow of death,,I will fear no evil,,for you are with me.",We can face any future without fear,so long as we know,we will not face it alone. 
 So for the sake of the future "you,",together let us strengthen,the future "us." 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)In my early days as a graduate student,,I went on a snorkeling tripnoff the coast of the Bahamas.,I'd actually never swumnin the ocean before,,so it was a bit terrifying.,What I remember the most is,nas I put my head in the water,and I was trying really hardnto breathe through the snorkel,,this huge groupnof striped yellow and black fish,came straight at me ...,and I just froze.,And then, as if it hadnsuddenly changed its mind,,came towards menand then swerved to the right,and went right around me.,It was absolutely mesmerizing.,Maybe many of younhave had this experience.,Of course, there's the colornand the beauty of it,,but there was alsonjust the sheer oneness of it,,as if it wasn't hundreds of fish,but a single entitynwith a single collective mind,that was making decisions.,When I look back, I think that experiencenreally ended up determining,what I've worked on for most of my career. 
 I'm a computer scientist,,and the field that I work innis artificial intelligence.,And a key theme in AI,is being able to understand intelligencenby creating our own computational systems,that display intelligencenthe way we see it in nature.,Now, most popular views of AI, of course,ncome from science fiction and the movies,,and I'm personally a big Star Wars fan.,But that tends to be a very human-centricnview of intelligence.,When you think of a fish school,,or when I think of a flock of starlings,,that feels like a really differentnkind of intelligence.,For starters, any one fish is just so tiny,compared to the sheer sizenof the collective,,so it seems that any one individual,would have a really limitednand myopic view of what's going on,,and intelligencenisn't really about the individual,but somehow a propertynof the group itself. 
 Secondly, and the thingnthat I still find most remarkable,,is that we know that there are no leadersnsupervising this fish school.,Instead, this incrediblencollective mind behavior,is emerging purely from the interactionsnof one fish and another.,Somehow, there are these interactionsnor rules of engagement,between neighboring fish,that make it all work out. 
 So the question for AI then becomes,,what are those rules of engagementnthat lead to this kind of intelligence,,and of course, can we create our own? 
 And that's the primary thingnthat I work on with my team in my lab.,We work on it through theory,,looking at abstract rule systems,and thinking aboutnthe mathematics behind it.,We also do it through biology,nworking closely with experimentalists.,But mostly, we do it through robotics,,where we try to createnour own collective systems,that can do the kinds of thingsnthat we see in nature,,or at least try to. 
 One of our first robotic questsnalong this line,was to create our very own colonynof a thousand robots.,So very simple robots,,but they could be programmednto exhibit collective intelligence,,and that's what we were able to do.,So this is what a single robot looks like.,It's quite small,nabout the size of a quarter,,and you can program how it moves,,but it can also wirelesslyncommunicate with other robots,,and it can measure distances from them.,And so now we can start to programnexactly an interaction,,a rule of engagement between neighbors.,And once we have this system,,we can start to program manyndifferent kinds of rules of engagement,that you would see in nature. 
 So for example,nspontaneous synchronization,,how audiences are clappingnand suddenly start all clapping together,,the fireflies flashing together.,We can program rulesnfor pattern formation,,how cells in a tissue,determine what rolenthey're going to take on,and set the patterns of our bodies.,We can program rules for migration,,and in this way, we're really learningnfrom nature's rules. 
 But we can also take it a step further.,We can actually take these rulesnthat we've learned from nature,and combine them and createnentirely new collective behaviors,of our very own. 
 So for example,,imagine that you hadntwo different kinds of rules.,So your first rule is a motion rule,where a moving robot can movenaround other stationary robots.,And your second rule is a pattern rule,where a robot takes on a colornbased on its two nearest neighbors.,So if I start with a blob of robotsnin a little pattern seed,,it turns out that these two rulesnare sufficient for the group,to be able to self-assemblena simple line pattern.,And if I have morencomplicated pattern rules,,and I design error correction rules,,we can actually create really,nreally complicated self assemblies,,and here's what that looks like. 
 So here, you're going to seena thousand robots,that are working togethernto self-assemble the letter K.,The K is on its side.,And the important thingnis that no one is in charge.,So any single robot is only talkingnto a small number of robots nearby it,,and it's using its motion rulento move around the half-built structure,just looking for a place to fit innbased on its pattern rules.,And even though no robotnis doing anything perfectly,,the rules are such that we can getnthe collective to do its goal,robustly together.,And the illusion becomesnalmost so perfect, you know --,you just start to not even noticenthat they're individual robots at all,,and it becomes a single entity,,kind of like the school of fish. 
 So these are robots and rulesnin two dimensions,,but we can also think about robotsnand rules in three dimensions.,So what if we could create robotsnthat could build together?,And here, we can take inspirationnfrom social insects.,So if you think aboutnmound-building termites,or you think about army ants,,they create incredible,ncomplex nest structures out of mud,and even out of their own bodies.,And like the system I showed you before,,these insects actuallynalso have pattern rules,that help them determine what to build,,but the pattern can be madenout of other insects,,or it could be made out of mud.,And we can use that same ideanto create rules for robots. 
 So here, you're going to seensome simulated robots.,So the simulated robot has a motion rule,,which is how it traversesnthrough the structure,,looking for a place to fit in,,and it has pattern rulesnwhere it looks at groups of blocks,to decide whether to place a block.,And with the right motion rulesnand the right pattern rules,,we can actually get the robotsnto build whatever we want.,And of course, everybody wantsntheir own tower. 
 (Laughter) 
 So once we have these rules,,we can start to create the robot bodiesnthat go with these rules.,So here, you see a robotnthat can climb over blocks,,but it can also lift and move these blocks,and it can start to editnthe very structure that it's on.,But with these rules,,this is really only one kind of robot bodynthat you could imagine.,You could imaginenmany different kinds of robot bodies.,So if you think about robotsnthat maybe could move sandbags,and could help build levees,,or we could think of robotsnthat built out of soft materials,and worked togethernto shore up a collapsed building --,so just the same kind of rulesnin different kinds of bodies.,Or if, like my group, you are completelynobsessed with army ants,,then maybe one day we can make robotsnthat can climb over literally anything,including other members of their tribe,,and self-assemble thingsnout of their own bodies.,Once you understand the rules,,just many different kindsnof robot visions become possible. 
 And coming back to the snorkeling trip,,we actually understand a great dealnabout the rules that fish schools use.,So if we can inventnthe bodies to go with that,,then maybe there is a future,where I and my group will get to snorkelnwith a fish school of our own creation. 
 Each of these systems that I showed you,brings us closer to havingnthe mathematical and the conceptual tools,to create our own versionsnof collective power,,and this can enable many different kindsnof future applications,,whether you think about robotsnthat build flood barriers,or you think about robotic bee coloniesnthat could pollinate crops,or underwater schools of robotsnthat monitor coral reefs,,or if we reach for the starsnand we thinking about programming,constellations of satellites.,In each of these systems,,being able to understandnhow to design the rules of engagement,and being able to createngood collective behavior,becomes a key to realizing these visions. 
 So, so far I've talked aboutnrules for insects and for fish,and for robots,,but what about the rules that applynto our own human collective?,And the last thoughtnthat I'd like to leave you with,is that science is of course itself,an incredible manifestationnof collective intelligence,,but unlike the beautifulnfish schools that I study,,I feel we still have a much longernevolutionary path to walk.,So in addition to working on improvingnthe science of robot collectives,,I also work on creating robotsnand thinking about rules,that will improvenour own scientific collective.,There's this saying that I love:,who does sciencendetermines what science gets done.,Imagine a society,where we had rules of engagement,where every child grew up believingnthat they could stand here,and be a technologist of the future,,or where every adult,believed that they had the abilitynnot just to understand but to change,how science and technologynimpacts their everyday lives.,What would that society look like?,I believe that we can do that.,I believe that we can choose our rules,,and we engineer not just robots,but we can engineernour own human collective,,and if we do and when we do,nit will be beautiful. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I want to share with younsomething my father taught me:,no condition is permanent.,It's a lesson he shared with menagain and again,,and I learned it to be true the hard way. 
 Here I am in my fourth-grade class.,This is my yearbook picturentaken in my class in school,in Monrovia, Liberia.,My parents migrated from Indianto West Africa in the 1970s,,and I had the privilegenof growing up there.,I was nine years old,,I loved kicking around a soccer ball,,and I was a total math and science geek.,I was living the kind of lifenthat, really, any child would dream of.,But no condition is permanent. 
 On Christmas Eve in 1989,,civil war erupted in Liberia.,The war started in the rural countryside,,and within months, rebel armiesnhad marched towards our hometown.,My school shut down,,and when the rebel armies capturednthe only international airport,,people started panicking and fleeing.,My mom came knocking one morningnand said, "Raj, pack your things --,we have to go.",We were rushed to the center of town,,and there on a tarmac,nwe were split into two lines.,I stood with my family in one line,,and we were stuffed into the cargo hatch,of a rescue plane.,And there on a bench,nI was sitting with my heart racing.,As I looked out the open hatch,,I saw hundreds of Liberiansnin another line,,children strapped to their backs.,When they tried to jump in with us,,I watched soldiers restrain them.,They were not allowed to flee. 
 We were the lucky ones.,We lost what we had,,but we resettled in America,,and as immigrants, we benefittednfrom the community of supporters,that rallied around us.,They took my family into their home,,they mentored me.,And they helped my dadnstart a clothing shop.,I'd visit my fathernon weekends as a teenager,to help him sell sneakers and jeans.,And every time business would get bad,,he'd remind me of that mantra:,no condition is permanent.,That mantra and my parents' persistencenand that community of supporters,made it possible for mento go through college,and eventually to medical school.,I'd once had my hopes crushed in a war,,but because of them,,I had a chance to pursue my dreamnto become a doctor.,My condition had changed. 
 It had been 15 yearsnsince I escaped that airfield,,but the memory of those two linesnhad not escaped my mind.,I was a medical student in my mid-20s,,and I wanted to go back,to see if I could serventhe people we'd left behind.,But when I got back,,what I found was utter destruction.,The war had left us with just 51 doctors,to serve a country of four million people.,It would be like the city of San Francisconhaving just 10 doctors.,So if you got sick in the citynwhere those few doctors remain,,you might stand a chance.,But if you got sick in the remote,nrural rainforest communities,,where you could be daysnfrom the nearest clinic --,I was seeing my patients dienfrom conditions no one should die from,,all because they werengetting to me too late.,Imagine you have a two-year-oldnwho wakes up one morning with a fever,,and you realize she could have malaria,,and you know the only way to get hernthe medicine she needs,would be to take her to the riverbed,,get in a canoe, paddle to the other side,and then walk for up to two daysnthrough the forest,just to reach the nearest clinic. 
 One billion people livenin the world's most remote communities,,and despite the advances we've madenin modern medicine and technology,,our innovations are notnreaching the last mile.,These communities have been left behind,,because they've been thoughtntoo hard to reach,and too difficult to serve.,Illness is universal;,access to care is not.,And realizing this lit a fire in my soul.,No one should die because they liventoo far from a doctor or clinic.,No condition should be permanent.,And help in this casendidn't come from the outside,,it actually came from within.,It came from the communities themselves. 
 Meet Musu.,Way out in rural Liberia,,where most girls have not hadna chance to finish primary school,,Musu had been persistent.,At the age of 18,nshe completed high school,,and she came back to her community.,She saw that none of the childrennwere getting treatment,for the diseasesnthey needed treatment for --,deadly diseases, like malarianand pneumonia.,So she signed up to be a volunteer.,There are millions of volunteers like Musunin rural parts around our world,,and we got to thinking --,community members like Musuncould actually help us solve a puzzle. 
 Our health care systemnis structured in such a way,that the work of diagnosing diseasenand prescribing medicines,is limited to a team of nursesnand doctors like me.,But nurses and doctorsnare concentrated in cities,,so rural communities like Musu'snhave been left behind. 
 So we started asking some questions:,What if we could reorganizenthe medical care system?,What if we could have communitynmembers like Musu,be a part or even be the centernof our medical team?,What if Musu could help us bringnhealth care from clinics in cities,to the doorsteps of her neighbors?,Musu was 48 when I met her.,And despite her amazing talent and grit,,she hadn't had a paying job in 30 years.,So what if technology could support her?,What if we could invest in hernwith real training,,equip her with real medicines,,and have her have a real job? 
 Well, in 2007, I was tryingnto answer these questions,,and my wife and I werengetting married that year.,We asked our relatives to forgonthe wedding registry gifts,and instead donate some money,so we could have some start-up moneynto launch a nonprofit.,I promise you, I'm a lotnmore romantic than that. 
 (Laughter) 
 We ended up raising $6,000,,teamed up with somenLiberians and Americans,and launched a nonprofitncalled Last Mile Health.,Our goal is to bring a health workernwithin reach of everyone, everywhere.,We designed a three-step process --,train, equip and pay --,to invest more deeplynin volunteers like Musu,to become paraprofessionals,,to become community health workers. 
 First we trained Musu to prevent,ndiagnose and treat,the top 10 diseases afflictingnfamilies in her village.,A nurse supervisor visited hernevery month to coach her.,We equipped her with modernnmedical technology,,like this $1 malaria rapid test,,and put it in a backpacknfull of medicines like this,to treat infections like pneumonia,,and crucially,,a smartphone, to help her tracknand report on epidemics.,Last, we recognizednthe dignity in Musu's work.,With the Liberian government,nwe created a contract,,paid her,and gave her the chancento have a real job.,And she's amazing. 
 Musu has learned over 30 medical skills,,from screening children for malnutrition,,to assessing the causenof a child's cough with a smartphone,,to supporting people with HIV,and providing follow-up carento patients who've lost their limbs.,Working as part of our team,,working as paraprofessionals,,community health workers can help ensure,that a lot of whatnyour family doctor would do,reaches the places that mostnfamily doctors could never go. 
 One of my favorite things to donis to care for patients,with community health workers.,So last year I was visiting A.B.,,and like Musu, A.B. had hadna chance to go to school.,He was in middle school,nin the eighth grade,,when his parents died.,He became an orphan and had to drop out.,Last year, we hired and trainednA.B. as a community health worker.,And while he was makingndoor to door house calls,,he met this young boy named Prince,,whose mother had had troublenbreastfeeding him,,and by the age of six months,nPrince had started to waste away.,A.B. had just been taught how to usenthis color-coded measuring tape,that wraps around the upper armnof a child to diagnose malnutrition.,A.B. noticed that Princenwas in the red zone,,which meant he had to be hospitalized. 
 So A.B. took Princenand his mother to the river,,got in a canoe,and paddled for four hoursnto get to the hospital.,Later, after Prince was discharged,,A.B. taught mom how to feed babyna food supplement.,A few months ago,,A.B. took me to visit Prince,nand he's a chubby little guy. 
 (Laughter) 
 He's meeting his milestones,nhe's pulled himself up to a stand,,and is even starting to say a few words.,I'm so inspired by thesencommunity health workers.,I often ask them why they do what they do,,and when I asked A.B.,,he said, "Doc, since I dropped outnof school, this is the first time,I'm having a chancento hold a pen to write.,My brain is getting fresh." 
 The stories of A.B. and Musunhave taught me something fundamental,about being human.,Our will to serve others,can actually help usntransform our own conditions.,I was so moved by how powerfulnthe will to serve our neighbors can be,a few years ago,,when we faced a global catastrophe. 
 In December 2013,,something happened in the rainforestsnacross the border from us in Guinea.,A toddler named Emile fell sicknwith vomiting, fever and diarrhea.,He lived in an areanwhere the roads were sparse,and there had been massivenshortages of health workers.,Emile died,,and a few weeks later his sister died,,and a few weeks later his mother died.,And this disease would spreadnfrom one community to another.,And it wasn't until three months later,that the world recognized this as Ebola.,When every minute counted,nwe had already lost months,,and by then the virus had spreadnlike wildfire all across West Africa,,and eventually to othernparts of the world.,Businesses shut down,nairlines started canceling routes. 
 At the height of the crisis,,when we were told that 1.4 millionnpeople could be infected,,when we were toldnthat most of them would die,,when we had nearly lost all hope,,I remember standing with a groupnof health workers,in the rainforest wherenan outbreak had just happened.,We were helping train and equipnthem to put on the masks,,the gloves and the gowns that they needed,to keep themselves safe from the virus,while they were serving their patients.,I remember the fear in their eyes.,And I remember staying up at night,nterrified if I'd made the right call,to keep them in the field. 
 When Ebola threatened to bringnhumanity to its knees,,Liberia's community health workersndidn't surrender to fear.,They did what they had always done:,they answered the callnto serve their neighbors.,Community members across Liberianlearned the symptoms of Ebola,,teamed up with nurses and doctorsnto go door-to-door to find the sick,and get them into care.,They tracked thousands of peoplenwho had been exposed to the virus,and helped breaknthe chain of transmission.,Some ten thousand communitynhealth workers risked their own lives,to help hunt down this virusnand stop it in its tracks. 
 (Applause) 
 Today, Ebola has comenunder control in West Africa,,and we've learned a few things.,We've learned that blind spotsnin rural health care,can lead to hot spots of disease,,and that places all of us at greater risk.,We've learned that the most efficientnemergency system,is actually an everyday system,,and that system has to reachnall communities,,including rural communities like Emile's.,And most of all,,we've learned from the couragenof Liberia's community health workers,that we as people are not definednby the conditions we face,,no matter how hopeless they seem.,We're defined by how we respond to them. 
 For the past 15 years,,I've seen the power of this idea,to transform everyday citizensninto community health workers --,into everyday heroes.,And I've seen it play out everywhere,,from the forest communitiesnof West Africa,,to the rural fishing villages of Alaska.,It's true,,these community health workersnaren't doing neurosurgery,,but they're making it possible,to bring health care within reachnof everyone everywhere. 
 So now what?,Well, we know that there are stillnmillions of people dying,from preventable causes,in rural communities around the world.,And we know that the great majoritynof these deaths are happening,in these 75 blue-shaded countries.,What we also know,is that if we trained an armynof community health workers,to learn even just 30 lifesaving skills,,we could save the lives of nearlyn30 million people by 2030.,Thirty services could saven30 million lives by 2030.,That's not just a blueprint --,we're proving this can be done. 
 In Liberia,,the Liberian government is trainingnthousands of workers like A.B. and Musu,after Ebola,,to bring health care to everynchild and family in the country.,And we've been honored to work with them,,and are now teaming upnwith a number of organizations,that are working across other countries,to try to help them do the same thing.,If we could help these countries scale,,we could save millions of lives,,and at the same time,,we could create millions of jobs. 
 We simply can't do that, though,nwithout technology.,People are worried that technologynis going to steal our jobs,,but when it comesnto community health workers,,technology has actuallynbeen vital for creating jobs.,Without technology --nwithout this smartphone,,without this rapid test --,it would have been impossible for usnto be able to employ A.B. and Musu.,And I think it's timenfor technology to help us train,,to help us train people fasternand better than ever before. 
 As a doctor,,I use technology to stay up-to-datenand keep certified.,I use smartphones, I use apps,nI use online courses.,But when A.B. wants to learn,,he's got to jump back in that canoe,and get to the training center.,And when Musu shows up for training,,her instructors are stuck usingnflip charts and markers.,Why shouldn't they have the samenaccess to learn as I do?,If we truly want community health workersnto master those lifesaving skills,and even more,,we've got to change this old-schoolnmodel of education.,Tech can truly be a game changer here.,I've been in awe of the digitalneducation revolution,that the likes of Khan Academynand edX have been leading.,And I've been thinking that it's time;,it's time for a collision,between the digital education revolution,and the community health revolution. 
 And so, this brings mento my TED Prize wish.,I wish --,I wish that you would help us recruit,the largest army of community healthnworkers the world has ever known,by creating the Community Health Academy,,a global platform to train,nconnect and empower. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 Here's the idea:,we'll create and curate,the best in digital education resources.,We will bring those to communitynhealth workers around the world,,including A.B. and Musu.,They'll get video lessonsnon giving kids vaccines,and have online coursesnon spotting the next outbreak,,so they're not stuck using flip charts.,We'll help these countriesnaccredit these workers,,so that they're not stuck remainingnan under-recognized, undervalued group,,but become a renowned,nempowered profession,,just like nurses and doctors. 
 And we'll create a networknof companies and entrepreneurs,who've created innovationsnthat can save lives,and help them connectnto workers like Musu,,so she can help betternserve her community.,And we'll work tirelesslynto persuade governments,to make community health workersna cornerstone of their health care plans.,We plan to test and prototypenthe academy in Liberia,and a few other partner countries,,and then we plan to take it global,,including to rural North America.,With the power of this platform,,we believe countries can be more persuaded,that a health care revolutionnreally is possible. 
 My dream is that this academynwill contribute to the training,of hundreds of thousandsnof community members,to help bring health carento their neighbors --,the hundreds of millions of them,that live in the world's mostnremote communities,,from the forest communitiesnof West Africa,,to the fishing villages of rural Alaska;,from the hilltops of Appalachia,nto the mountains of Afghanistan.,If this vision is aligned with yours,,head to communityhealthacademy.org,,and join this revolution.,Let us know if you or your organizationnor someone you know could help us,as we try to build this academynover the next year. 
 Now, as I look out into this room,,I realize that our journeysnare not self-made;,they're shaped by others.,And there have been so many herenthat have been part of this cause.,We're so honored to be partnof this community,,and a community that's willingnto take on a cause,as audacious as this one,,so I wanted to offer, as I end,,a reflection. 
 I think a lot more aboutnwhat my father taught me.,These days, I too have become a dad.,I have two sons,,and my wife and I just learnednthat she's pregnant with our third child. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 I was recently caringnfor a woman in Liberia,who, like my wife,nwas in her third pregnancy.,But unlike my wife,,had had no prenatal carenwith her first two babies.,She lived in an isolated communitynin the forest that had gone for 100 years,without any health care,until ...,until last year when a nursentrained her neighbors,to become community health workers. 
 So here I was,,seeing this patientnwho was in her second trimester,,and I pulled out the ultrasoundnto check on the baby,,and she started telling us storiesnabout her first two kids,,and I had the ultrasoundnprobe on her belly,,and she just stopped mid-sentence.,She turned to me and she said,,"Doc, what's that sound?",It was the first time she'd ever heardnher baby's heartbeat.,And her eyes lit up in the same waynmy wife's eyes and my own eyes lit up,when we heard our baby's heartbeat. 
 For all of human history,,illness has been universalnand access to care has not.,But as a wise man once told me:,no condition is permanent.,It's time.,It's time for us to go as far as it takes,to change this condition together. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Whether you like it or not,,radical transparency and algorithmicndecision-making is coming at you fast,,and it's going to change your life.,That's because it's now easynto take algorithms,and embed them into computers,and gather all that datanthat you're leaving on yourself,all over the place,,and know what you're like,,and then direct the computersnto interact with you,in ways that are betternthan most people can. 
 Well, that might sound scary.,I've been doing this for a long timenand I have found it to be wonderful.,My objective has beennto have meaningful work,and meaningful relationshipsnwith the people I work with,,and I've learned that I couldn't have that,unless I had that radical transparencynand that algorithmic decision-making.,I want to show you why that is,,I want to show you how it works.,And I warn you that some of the thingsnthat I'm going to show you,probably are a little bit shocking. 
 Since I was a kid,nI've had a terrible rote memory.,And I didn't like following instructions,,I was no good at following instructions.,But I loved to figure outnhow things worked for myself.,When I was 12,,I hated school but I fell in lovenwith trading the markets.,I caddied at the time,,earned about five dollars a bag.,And I took my caddying money,nand I put it in the stock market.,And that was just becausenthe stock market was hot at the time.,And the first company I bought,was a company by the namenof Northeast Airlines.,Northeast Airlines wasnthe only company I heard of,that was selling for lessnthan five dollars a share. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I figured I could buy more shares,,and if it went up, I'd make more money.,So, it was a dumb strategy, right?,But I tripled my money,,and I tripled my moneynbecause I got lucky.,The company was about to go bankrupt,,but some other company acquired it,,and I tripled my money.,And I was hooked.,And I thought, "This game is easy.",With time,,I learned this game is anything but easy. 
 In order to be an effective investor,,one has to bet against the consensus,and be right.,And it's not easy to betnagainst the consensus and be right.,One has to bet againstnthe consensus and be right,because the consensusnis built into the price.,And in order to be an entrepreneur,,a successful entrepreneur,,one has to bet againstnthe consensus and be right.,I had to be an entrepreneurnand an investor --,and what goes along with thatnis making a lot of painful mistakes.,So I made a lot of painful mistakes,,and with time,,my attitude about those mistakesnbegan to change.,I began to think of them as puzzles.,That if I could solve the puzzles,,they would give me gems.,And the puzzles were:,What would I do differently in the futurenso I wouldn't make that painful mistake?,And the gems were principles,that I would then write downnso I would remember them,that would help me in the future.,And because I wrote them down so clearly,,I could then --,eventually discovered --,I could then embed them into algorithms.,And those algorithmsnwould be embedded in computers,,and the computers wouldnmake decisions along with me;,and so in parallel,nwe would make these decisions.,And I could see how those decisionsnthen compared with my own decisions,,and I could see thatnthose decisions were a lot better.,And that was because the computerncould make decisions much faster,,it could process a lot more information,and it can process decisions much more --,less emotionally.,So it radically improvednmy decision-making. 
 Eight years after I started Bridgewater,,I had my greatest failure,,my greatest mistake.,It was late 1970s,,I was 34 years old,,and I had calculated that American banks,had lent much more moneynto emerging countries,than those countriesnwere going to be able to pay back,and that we would haventhe greatest debt crisis,since the Great Depression.,And with it, an economic crisis,and a big bear market in stocks.,It was a controversial view at the time.,People thought it wasnkind of a crazy point of view.,But in August 1982,,Mexico defaulted on its debt,,and a number of other countries followed.,And we had the greatest debt crisisnsince the Great Depression.,And because I had anticipated that,,I was asked to testify to Congressnand appear on "Wall Street Week,",which was the show of the time.,Just to give you a flavor of that,nI've got a clip here,,and you'll see me in there. 
 (Video) Mr. Chairman, Mr. Mitchell,,it's a great pleasure and a great honornto be able to appear before you,in examination with whatnis going wrong with our economy.,The economy is now flat --,teetering on the brink of failure. 
 Martin Zweig: You were recentlynquoted in an article.,You said, "I can say thisnwith absolute certainty,because I know how markets work." 
 Ray Dalio: I can saynwith absolute certainty,that if you look at the liquidity base,in the corporationsnand the world as a whole,,that there's such reducednlevel of liquidity,that you can't returnnto an era of stagflation." 
 I look at that now, I think,n"What an arrogant jerk!" 
 (Laughter) 
 I was so arrogant, and I was so wrong.,I mean, while the debt crisis happened,,the stock market and the economynwent up rather than going down,,and I lost so much moneynfor myself and for my clients,that I had to shut downnmy operation pretty much,,I had to let almost everybody go.,And these were like extended family,,I was heartbroken.,And I had lost so much money,that I had to borrown4,000 dollars from my dad,to help to pay my family bills. 
 It was one of the most painfulnexperiences of my life ...,but it turned out to benone of the greatest experiences of my life,because it changed my attitudenabout decision-making.,Rather than thinking, "I'm right,",I started to ask myself,,"How do I know I'm right?",I gained a humility that I needed,in order to balance my audacity.,I wanted to find the smartestnpeople who would disagree with me,to try to understand their perspective,or to have themnstress test my perspective.,I wanted to make an idea meritocracy.,In other words,,not an autocracy in whichnI would lead and others would follow,and not a democracy in which everybody'snpoints of view were equally valued,,but I wanted to have an idea meritocracynin which the best ideas would win out.,And in order to do that,,I realized that we would neednradical truthfulness,and radical transparency. 
 What I mean by radical truthfulnessnand radical transparency,is people needed to saynwhat they really believed,and to see everything.,And we literallyntape almost all conversations,and let everybody see everything,,because if we didn't do that,,we couldn't really havenan idea meritocracy.,In order to have an idea meritocracy,,we have let people speaknand say what they want.,Just to give you an example,,this is an email from Jim Haskel --,somebody who works for me --,and this was availablento everybody in the company.,"Ray, you deserve a 'D-',for your performancentoday in the meeting ...,you did not prepare at all well,because there is no waynyou could have been that disorganized.",Isn't that great? 
 (Laughter) 
 That's great.,It's great because, first of all,nI needed feedback like that.,I need feedback like that.,And it's great because if I don't let Jim,nand people like Jim,,to express their points of view,,our relationship wouldn't be the same.,And if I didn't make that publicnfor everybody to see,,we wouldn't have an idea meritocracy. 
 So for that last 25 yearsnthat's how we've been operating.,We've been operatingnwith this radical transparency,and then collecting these principles,,largely from making mistakes,,and then embeddingnthose principles into algorithms.,And then those algorithms provide --,we're following the algorithms,in parallel with our thinking.,That has been how we've runnthe investment business,,and it's how we also dealnwith the people management. 
 In order to give you a glimmerninto what this looks like,,I'd like to take you into a meeting,and introduce you to a tool of oursncalled the "Dot Collector",that helps us do this.,A week after the US election,,our research team held a meeting,to discuss what a Trump presidencynwould mean for the US economy.,Naturally, people hadndifferent opinions on the matter,and how we werenapproaching the discussion.,The "Dot Collector" collects these views.,It has a list of a few dozen attributes,,so whenever somebody thinks somethingnabout another person's thinking,,it's easy for themnto convey their assessment;,they simply note the attributenand provide a rating from one to 10.,For example, as the meeting began,,a researcher named Jen rated me a three --,in other words, badly -- 
 (Laughter) 
 for not showing a good balancenof open-mindedness and assertiveness.,As the meeting transpired,,Jen's assessments of peoplenadded up like this.,Others in the roomnhave different opinions.,That's normal.,Different people are alwaysngoing to have different opinions.,And who knows who's right?,Let's look at just what people thoughtnabout how I was doing.,Some people thought I did well,,others, poorly.,With each of these views,,we can explore the thinkingnbehind the numbers.,Here's what Jen and Larry said.,Note that everyonengets to express their thinking,,including their critical thinking,,regardless of their positionnin the company.,Jen, who's 24 years oldnand right out of college,,can tell me, the CEO,nthat I'm approaching things terribly. 
 This tool helps peoplenboth express their opinions,and then separate themselvesnfrom their opinions,to see things from a higher level.,When Jen and others shift their attentionsnfrom inputting their own opinions,to looking down on the whole screen,,their perspective changes.,They see their own opinionsnas just one of many,and naturally start asking themselves,,"How do I know my opinion is right?",That shift in perspective is like goingnfrom seeing in one dimension,to seeing in multiple dimensions.,And it shifts the conversationnfrom arguing over our opinions,to figuring out objective criterianfor determining which opinions are best. 
 Behind the "Dot Collector"nis a computer that is watching.,It watches what allnthese people are thinking,and it correlates thatnwith how they think.,And it communicates advicenback to each of them based on that.,Then it draws the datanfrom all the meetings,to create a pointilist paintingnof what people are like,and how they think.,And it does that guided by algorithms.,Knowing what people are like helpsnto match them better with their jobs.,For example,,a creative thinker who is unreliable,might be matched up with someonenwho's reliable but not creative.,Knowing what people are likenalso allows us to decide,what responsibilities to give them,and to weigh our decisionsnbased on people's merits.,We call it their believability.,Here's an example of a vote that we took,where the majoritynof people felt one way ...,but when we weighed the viewsnbased on people's merits,,the answer was completely different.,This process allows us to make decisionsnnot based on democracy,,not based on autocracy,,but based on algorithms that takenpeople's believability into consideration. 
 Yup, we really do this. 
 (Laughter) 
 We do it because it eliminates,what I believe to benone of the greatest tragedies of mankind,,and that is people arrogantly,,naïvely holding opinionsnin their minds that are wrong,,and acting on them,,and not putting them out therento stress test them.,And that's a tragedy.,And we do it because it elevates ourselvesnabove our own opinions,so that we start to see thingsnthrough everybody's eyes,,and we see things collectively.,Collective decision-making is so muchnbetter than individual decision-making,if it's done well.,It's been the secret saucenbehind our success.,It's why we've madenmore money for our clients,than any other hedge fund in existence,and made moneyn23 out of the last 26 years. 
 So what's the problemnwith being radically truthful,and radically transparent with each other?,People say it's emotionally difficult.,Critics say it's a formulanfor a brutal work environment.,Neuroscientists tell me it has to donwith how are brains are prewired.,There's a part of our brainnthat would like to know our mistakes,and like to look at our weaknessesnso we could do better.,I'm told that that'snthe prefrontal cortex.,And then there's a part of our brainnwhich views all of this as attacks.,I'm told that that's the amygdala.,In other words,nthere are two you's inside you:,there's an emotional you,and there's an intellectual you,,and often they're at odds,,and often they work against you.,It's been our experiencenthat we can win this battle.,We win it as a group.,It takes about 18 months typically,to find that most peoplenprefer operating this way,,with this radical transparency,than to be operatingnin a more opaque environment.,There's not politics,nthere's not the brutality of --,you know, all of that hidden,nbehind-the-scenes --,there's an idea meritocracynwhere people can speak up.,And that's been great.,It's given us more effective work,,and it's given usnmore effective relationships.,But it's not for everybody.,We found something liken25 or 30 percent of the population,it's just not for.,And by the way,,when I say radical transparency,,I'm not saying transparencynabout everything.,I mean, you don't have to tell somebodynthat their bald spot is growing,or their baby's ugly.,So, I'm just talking about -- 
 (Laughter) 
 talking about the important things.,So -- 
 (Laughter) 
 So when you leave this room,,I'd like you to observe yourselfnin conversations with others.,Imagine if you knewnwhat they were really thinking,,and imagine if you knewnwhat they were really like ...,and imagine if they knewnwhat you were really thinking,and what were really like.,It would certainly clear things up a lot,and make your operationsntogether more effective.,I think it will improvenyour relationships.,Now imagine that you can have algorithms,that will help you gathernall of that information,and even help you make decisionsnin an idea-meritocratic way.,This sort of radical transparencynis coming at you,and it is going to affect your life.,And in my opinion,,it's going to be wonderful.,So I hope it is as wonderful for you,as it is for me. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Michael Browning: engineer,,innovator --,inventor, really --,and inspiring father.,He had a passion for flight,nas you can kind of sense,from that rather dubiousn1970s office-leaving present.,And some 40 years after that was created,,a small group of us got together,to have a go,,a run at the whole challenge of flightnthat inspired people for years,,and do it in a very different kind of way.,And that's the journey I'd likento share with you now. 
 The starting hypothesis was onenof the human mind and body,,which, as you've seennfor the last few days here,,is an amazing construct.,What if you augmentednthat wonderful machine,with just the right technology?,If you approach flightnin that kind of real way,,where could you get to? 
 So my training partner herenback in London, Denton,,is doing a much better jobnof that kind of stuff than me.,Guess what? It's London.,The idea was that you augment that.,And so, how do you augment that?,Well, we bought one of these. 
 This is a micro gas turbine.,This was ground zero,,so that little piece of kitnproved really quite impressive,,so we got two in a field.,The real hero here, by the way,nis, right in the background,,there's a lady tending some vegetables,,who does a brilliant jobnof trying to ignore us for a while -- 
 (Laughter) 
 I think the only thingnless happy is the grass,,that we did probably damage quite badly. 
 You get an idea of the thrust here,,when I try to hold them horizontallynand somewhat fail.,That's around 50 kilos of thrust there.,We were quite impressed with that.,We thought we were getting somewhere. 
 So there's only one sensible waynto go from there:,you get four. 
 (Laughter) 
 I have to say, I still likenwatching these back. 
 So then we thought well, let's trynand spread the load a bit.,The legs are designed to take the load,,so why don't we spread it out a bit?,That bit was good.,The harness --,a nice idea but it didn't really work,,as you'll see now.,This whole journey was very muchnabout trying things -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Yeah, it really didn't work, did it? 
 Trying things and learningnby failing at them most of the time.,And that included failing by falling over.,If you notice, we've gotnfive engines here --,not to be put off by the factnone was in maintenance,,still had a go. 
 (Laughter) 
 And then I pinched a fuel line.,So again, good learning.nWe learned not to do that again. 
 This was a blind alley. 
 (Laughter) 
 This was three on each arm --,that was ridiculous.,That was 70 kilos on each arm.,Again, struck that one off. 
 (Laughter) 
 But we were starting to makensome really quite convincing progress,,just enough to make younbelieve that maybe --,maybe we could get there.,You can see, look -- tantalizing.,The model of one on each legnand two on each arm,,on paper, that was enough thrust.,And then we did whatnI'm about to show you now,,and I still love watching this one.,This was our first six-second,nreasonably coherent flight. 
 (Applause) 
 That was the point wherenthis endeavor went from:,"I'm really not surenthis is going to work,",to: "Oh my god, it does work!",From there on we then refined it,,but we carried on falling over a lot.,Falling over, like I say, is definitelynthe best way to learn.,After a while, we startingnreally refining the layout of all of this.,And you'll see,nthat's stability and control --,there's no wires there or anything --,that's a combination of usnrefining the technology,,including with a Tupperware boxnon the back for the electronics,and actually learningnthe balance and control. 
 I'm now going to save your earsnfor the next short piece,and talk over it.,After a while, the jet enginennoise is a bit annoying.,This is only a few weeks ago.,You can see the stability and controlnis really quite nice,,and I'd like to think this somewhatnvalidates that starting hypothesis,,that the human mind and body,nif properly augmented in that way,,can achieve some pretty cool stuff.,I mean, like I said:,I'm not thinking about wherenI'm moving my arms at that stage.,I'm looking at the objectivenof where I want to get to,,and a bit like riding a bike,,my arms are just doing their thing.,It's a very strange experience. 
 So where is all this headed? 
 I'll talk over this landing --,I think I land in this one. 
 Well, I don't think anybody's goingnto go down to Walmart,or take the kids to schoolnin any of this stuff for a while,,but the team at Gravity are buildingnsome awesome technology,that's going to makenthis look like child's play.,We're working on some things,that will seek to bringnthis unusual experience of flight,to a wider audience, beyond the eventsnand displays we're doing.,We're even starting to looknfor pilots two and three,,if there's any volunteers. 
 I've got this vision.,It sounds audacious,nbut let's just stick it out there,,that one day maybe we cannrise up above a beach,,fly up and down the coastlinenof it, rise up a bit higher,,with some of the safety kitnwe're working on to make this achievable.,Then over the horizon comesna Hercules with the ramp down.,As it comes past,nyou start picking up speed,and see if we can intercept --,from the rear, not the front,nthat would be a mistake --,and then try and land in the back.,And as I say, that's a littlenway off at the moment. 
 But this is also, if I takena big step back from this,,this is also a verynpersonal journey for me.,Back to that lovely photo,,or photo in a picture.,Sadly, my father tooknhis own life when I was 15,,and left an awful lotnof unfulfilled ambition.,He was a wonderful inventor,,a maverick creator.,And I'd just like to think,nif it was possible,,if he was looking down,,he would be --,he'd certainly be smiling at somenof the things we've done here,,I think.,So, it's a tribute to him. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 (Voice-over) Richard Browning:nI'm probably more nervous,about doing the demo after this.,I've got a lot of thingsnto get done today.,Worst-case scenario,nwe don't get a clean start. 
 Or we get an unplanned failurenwhile I'm actually flying around.,This is why we keep it very low,,so the worst is I just look like an idiotnand fall on my rear, as I said.,So you can all enjoy that if that happens. 
 (Music) 
 (Jet engine accelerates) 
 (Cheers)Chris Anderson: So Robertnspent the last few years,think about how weird human behavior is,,and how inadequate mostnof our language trying to explain it is.,And it's very exciting to hear himnexplain some of the thinking behind it,in public for the first time.,Over to you now, Robert Sapolsky. 
 (Applause) 
 Robert Sapolsky: Thank you.,The fantasy always runsnsomething like this.,I've overpowered his elite guard,,burst into his secret bunker,with my machine gun ready.,He lunges for his Luger.,I knock it out of his hand.,He lunges for his cyanide pill.,I knock that out of his hand.,He snarls,,comes at me with otherworldly strength.,We grapple, we fight,,I manage to pin him down,and put on handcuffs.,"Adolf Hitler," I say,,"I arrest you for crimesnagainst humanity." 
 Here's where the Medal of Honornversion of the fantasy ends,and the imagery darkens.,What would I do if I had Hitler?,It's not hard to imaginenonce I allow myself.,Sever his spine at the neck.,Take out his eyes with a blunt instrument.,Puncture his eardrums. Cut out his tongue.,Leave him alive on a respirator,,tube-fed, not able to speaknor move or see or hear, just to feel,,and then inject himnwith something cancerous,that's going to fester and pustulate,until every cell in his bodynis screaming in agony,,until every secondnfeels like an eternity in hell.,That's what I would do to Hitler. 
 I've had this fantasy since I was a kid,,still do sometimes,,and when I do, my heart speeds up --,all these plans for the most evil,nwicked soul in history.,But there's a problem,,which is I don't actually believenin souls or evil,,and I think wicked belongs in a musical.,But there's some peoplenI would like to see killed,,but I'm against the death penalty.,But I like schlocky violent movies,,but I'm for strict gun control.,But then there was a timenI was at a laser tag place,,and I had such a good timenhiding in a corner shooting at people.,In other words, I'm your basicnconfused human when it comes to violence. 
 Now, as a species, we obviouslynhave problems with violence.,We use shower heads to deliver poison gas,,letters with anthrax,nairplanes as weapons,,mass rape as a military strategy.,We're a miserably violent species.,But there's a complication,,which is we don't hate violence,,we hate the wrong kind.,And when it's the right kind,,we cheer it on, we hand out medals,,we vote for, we mate withnour champions of it.,When it's the right kind of violence,,we love it.,And there's another complication,,which is, in addition to usnbeing this miserably violent species,,we're also this extraordinarilynaltruistic, compassionate one. 
 So how do you make sensenof the biology of our best behaviors,,our worst ones and all of thosenambiguously in between? 
 Now, for starters,,what's totally boring is understandingnthe motoric aspects of the behavior.,Your brain tells your spine,ntells your muscles,to do something or other,,and hooray, you've behaved.,What's hard is understandingnthe meaning of the behavior,,because in some settings,npulling a trigger is an appalling act;,in others, it's heroicallynself-sacrificial.,In some settings, putting your handnone someone else's,is deeply compassionate.,In others, it's a deep betrayal.,The challenge is to understand,the biology of the contextnof our behaviors,,and that's real tough. 
 One thing that's clear, though,nis you're not going to get anywhere,if you think there's going to benthe brain region or the hormone,or the gene or the childhood experience,or the evolutionary mechanismnthat explains everything.,Instead, every bit of behaviornhas multiple levels of causality. 
 Let's look at an example.,You have a gun.,There's a crisis going on:,rioting, violence, people running around.,A stranger is running at younin an agitated state --,you can't quite tell if the expressionnis frightened, threatening, angry --,holding somethingnthat kind of looks like a handgun.,You're not sure.,The stranger comes running at you,and you pull the trigger.,And it turns outnthat thing in this person's hand,was a cell phone. 
 So we asked this biological question:,what was going onnthat caused this behavior?,What caused this behavior?,And this is a multitude of questions. 
 We start.,What was going on in your brainnone second before you pulled that trigger?,And this brings us into the realmnof a brain region called the amygdala.,The amygdala, which isncentral to violence, central to fear,,initiates volleys of cascades,that produce pulling of a trigger.,What was the level of activitynin your amygdala one second before? 
 But to understand that,nwe have to step back a little bit.,What was going on in the environmentnseconds to minutes before,that impacted the amygdala?,Now, obviously, the sights,nthe sounds of the rioting,,that was pertinent.,But in addition,,you're more likely to mistakena cell phone for a handgun,if that stranger was male,and large and of a different race.,Furthermore, if you're in pain,,if you're hungry, if you're exhausted,,your frontal cortexnis not going to work as well,,part of the brain whose job it isnto get to the amygdala in time,saying, "Are you really surenthat's a gun there?" 
 But we need to step further back.,Now we have to looknat hours to days before,,and with this, we have enterednthe realm of hormones.,For example, testosterone,,where regardless of your sex,,if you have elevatedntestosterone levels in your blood,,you're more likely to thinkna face with a neutral expression,is instead looking threatening.,Elevated testosterone levels,nelevated levels of stress hormones,,and your amygdalanis going to be more active,and your frontal cortexnwill be more sluggish. 
 Pushing back further,nweeks to months before,,where's the relevance there?,This is the realm of neural plasticity,,the fact that your brainncan change in response to experience,,and if your previous monthsnhave been filled with stress and trauma,,your amygdala will have enlarged.,The neurons will have becomenmore excitable,,your frontal cortex would have atrophied,,all relevant to what happensnin that one second. 
 But we push back even more, back years,,back, for example, to your adolescence.,Now, the central factnof the adolescent brain,is all of it is going full blast,except the frontal cortex,,which is still half-baked.,It doesn't fully maturenuntil you're around 25.,And thus, adolescence and early adulthood,are the years where environmentnand experience sculpt your frontal cortex,into the version you're going to havenas an adult in that critical moment. 
 But pushing back even further,,even further backnto childhood and fetal life,and all the different versionsnthat that could come in.,Now, obviously, that's the timenthat your brain is being constructed,,and that's important,,but in addition,nexperience during those times,produce what are callednepigenetic changes,,permanent, in some cases,,permanently activatingncertain genes, turning off others.,And as an example of this,,if as a fetus you were exposed to a lotnof stress hormones through your mother,,epigenetics is going to producenyour amygdala in adulthood,as a more excitable form,,and you're going to havenelevated stress hormone levels. 
 But pushing even further back,,back to when you were just a fetus,,back to when all you werenwas a collection of genes.,Now, genes are reallynimportant to all of this,,but critically, genes don'tndetermine anything,,because genes work differentlynin different environments.,Key example here:,there's a variant of a gene called MAO-A,,and if you have that variant,,you are far more likelynto commit antisocial violence,if, and only if,nyou were abused as a child.,Genes and environment interact,,and what's happening in that one secondnbefore you pull that trigger,reflects your lifetimenof those gene-environment interactions. 
 Now, remarkably enough,nwe've got to push even further back now,,back centuries.,What were your ancestors up to.,And if, for example,nthey were nomadic pastoralists,,they were pastoralists,,people living in deserts or grasslands,with their herds of camels, cows, goats,,odds are they would have inventednwhat's called a culture of honor,filled with warrior classes,,retributive violence, clan vendettas,,and amazingly, centuries later,,that would still be influencingnthe values with which you were raised. 
 But we've got to push even further back,,back millions of years,,because if we're talking about genes,,implicitly we're now talkingnabout the evolution of genes.,And what you see is, for example,,patterns across different primate species.,Some of them have evolvednfor extremely low levels of aggression,,others have evolvednin the opposite direction,,and floating there in betweennby every measure are humans,,once again this confused,nbarely defined species,that has all these potentialsnto go one way or the other. 
 So what has this gotten us to?,Basically, what we're seeing here is,,if you want to understand a behavior,,whether it's an appalling one,na wondrous one,,or confusedly in between,,if you want to understand that,,you've got take into accountnwhat happened a second before,to a million years before,,everything in between. 
 So what can we conclude at this point?,Officially, it's complicated.,Wow, that's really helpful.,It's complicated,,and you'd better benreal careful, real cautious,before you concludenyou know what causes a behavior,,especially if it's a behaviornyou're judging harshly. 
 Now, to me, the single most importantnpoint about all of this,is one having to do with change.,Every bit of biology I have mentioned herencan change in different circumstances.,For example, ecosystems change.,Thousands of years ago,nthe Sahara was a lush grassland.,Cultures change.,In the 17th century, the most terrifyingnpeople in Europe were the Swedes,,rampaging all over the place.,This is what the Swedishnmilitary does now.,They haven't had a war in 200 years.,Most importantly,,brains change.,Neurons grow new processes.,Circuits disconnect.,Everything in the brain changes,,and out of this come extraordinarynexamples of human change. 
 First one:,this is a man named John Newton,,a British theologian,who played a central role in the abolitionnof slavery from the British Empire,in the early 1800s.,And amazingly, this mannspent decades as a younger man,as the captain of a slave ship,,and then as an investor in slavery,,growing rich from this.,And then something changed.,Something changed in him,,something that Newton himself celebratednin the thing that he's most famous for,,a hymn that he wrote:,"Amazing Grace." 
 This is a man named Zenji Abenon the morning of December 6, 1941,,about to lead a squadron of Japanesenbombers to attack Pearl Harbor.,And this is the same mann50 years later to the day,hugging a man who survivednthe attack on the ground.,And as an old man,,Zenji Abe came to a collectionnof Pearl Harbor survivors,at a ceremony there,and in halting English apologizednfor what he had done as a young man. 
 Now, it doesn't always require decades.,Sometimes, extraordinary changencould happen in just hours.,Consider the World War InChristmas truce of 1914.,The powers that benhad negotiated a brief truce,so that soldiers could go out,,collect bodies from no-man's-landnin between the trench lines.,And soon British and German soldiers,were doing that,,and then helping each other carry bodies,,and then helping each otherndig graves in the frozen ground,,and then praying together,,and then having Christmas togethernand exchanging gifts,,and by the next day,nthey were playing soccer together,and exchanging addressesnso they could meet after the war.,That truce kept goingnuntil the officers had to arrive,and said, "We will shoot you,unless you go backnto trying to kill each other.",And all it took here was hours,for these men to developna completely new category of "us,",all of us in the trenches here,on both sides, dying for no damn reason,,and who is a "them,"nthose faceless powers behind the lines,who were using them as pawns. 
 And sometimes,nchange can occur in seconds.,Probably the most horrifying eventnin the Vietnam War,was the My Lai Massacre.,A brigade of American soldiers,went into an undefendednvillage full of civilians,and killed between 350 and 500 of them,,mass-raped women and children,,mutilated bodies.,It was appalling.,It was appalling because it occurred,nbecause the government denied it,,because the US government eventuallyndid nothing more than a slap on the wrist,,and appalling because it almost certainlynwas not a singular event.,This man, Hugh Thompson, this is the mannwho stopped the My Lai Massacre.,He was piloting a helicopter gunship,,landed there, got out,and saw American soldiers shooting babies,,shooting old women,,figured out what was going on,,and he then took his helicopter,and did something that undidnhis lifetime of conditioning,as to who is an "us" and who is a "them.",He landed his helicopter,in between some surviving villagersnand American soldiers,and he trained his machine gunsnon his fellow Americans,,and said, "If you don't stop the killing,nI will mow you down." 
 Now, these peoplenare no more special than any of us.,Same neurons, same neurochemicals,,same biology.,What we're left with herenis this inevitable cliche:,"Those who don't study historynare destined to repeat it.",What we have here is the opposite of it.,Those who don't study the historynof extraordinary human change,,those who don't study the biologynof what can transform us,from our worst to our best behaviors,,those who don't do thisnare destined not to be able,to repeat these incandescent,nmagnificent moments. 
 So thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 CA: Talks that really give youna new mental model about something,,those are some of my favorite TED Talks,,and we just got one.,Robert, thank you so much for that.nGood luck with the book.,That was amazing,,and we're going to try and get younto come here in person one year.,Thank you so much. 
 RS: Thank you. Thank you all.Someday, we may have robotsnas smart as people,,artificial intelligence, AI.,How could that happen?,One route is that we'll just keepnaccumulating better software,,like we've been doing for 70 years.,At past rates of progress,nthat may take centuries.,Some say it'll happen a lot faster,as we discover grand newnpowerful theories of intelligence.,I'm skeptical. 
 But a third scenario,is what I'm going to talk about today.,The idea is to port the softwarenfrom the human brain.,To do this, we're going to neednthree technologies to be good enough,,and none of them are there yet.,First, we're going to neednlots of cheap, fast, parallel computers.,Second, we're going to neednto scan individual human brains,in fine spatial and chemical detail,,to see exactly what cells are where,nconnected to what, of what type.,And third, we're going to needncomputer models,of how each kind of brain cell works --,taking input signals,nchanging interval state,and sending output signals.,If we have good enough modelsnof all the kinds of brain cells,and a good enough model of the brain,,we can put it together to makena good enough model of an entire brain,,and that model would have the sameninput-output behavior as the original.,So if you talk to it, it might talk back.,If you ask it to do things,nit might do them.,And if we could do that,neverything would change. 
 People have been talkingnabout this idea for decades,,under the name of "uploads.",I'm going to call them "ems.",When they talk about it, they say,,"Is this even possible?,If you made one, would it be conscious?nOr is it just an empty machine?,If you made one of me,nis that me or someone else?",These are all fascinating questionsnthat I'm going to ignore ... 
 (Laughter) 
 because I see a neglected question:,What would actually happen?,I became obsessed with this question.,I spent four years trying to analyze it,,using standard academic tools,nto guess what would happen,,and I'm here to tell you what I found.,But be warned --,I'm not offering inspiration,nI'm offering analysis.,I see my job as telling younwhat's most likely to happen,if we did the least to avoid it.,If you aren't at least a bit disturbednby something I tell you here,,you're just not paying attention. 
 (Laughter) 
 OK, the first thing I can tell you,is that ems spend mostnof their life in virtual reality.,This is what you might look likenif you were using virtual reality.,And this is what you might see:,sunlight glinting off of water,nyou might hear gulls flying above,,you might even feel the windnon your cheeks or smell seawater,,with advanced hardware.,Now, if you were to spendna lot of time here,,you might want a dashboard,where you could do things likenmake a phone call,,move to a new virtual world,,check your bank account. 
 Now, while this is whatnyou would look like in virtual reality,,this is what an emnwould look like in virtual reality.,It's computer hardwarensitting in a server rack somewhere.,But still, it could seenand experience the same thing.,But some things are different for ems.,First, while you'll probably always noticenthat virtual reality isn't entirely real,,to an em, it can feel as real to themnas this room feels to you now,or as anything ever feels.,And ems also havensome more action possibilities. 
 For example, your mind just alwaysnruns at the same speed,,but an em can add more or lessncomputer hardware to run faster or slower,,and therefore, if the world around themnseems to be going too fast,,they can just speed up their mind,,and the world around themnwould seem to slow down. 
 In addition, an em can makena copy of itself at that moment.,This copy would rememberneverything the same,,and if it starts out with the same speed,nlooking at the same speed,,it might even need to be told,n"You are the copy.",And em could make archive copies,,and with enough archives,,an em can be immortal --,in principle, though notnusually in practice.,And an em can move its brain,nthe computer that represents its brain,,from one physical location to another.,Ems can actually move around the worldnat the speed of light,,and by moving to a new location,,they can interact more quicklynwith ems near that new location. 
 So far, I've been talking aboutnwhat ems can do.,What do ems choose to do?,To understand that, we'll neednto understand three key facts.,First, ems by definition do whatnthe human they emulate would do,in the same situation.,So their lives and behaviornare very human.,They're mainly different becausenthey're living in a different world.,Second, ems neednreal resources to survive.,You need food and shelter or you'll die.,Also, ems need computer hardware,nenergy, cooling, or they can't exist.,For every subjective minutenthat an em experiences,,someone, usually that em,nhad to work to pay for it.,Third, ems are poor. 
 (Laughter) 
 The em population can grownquicker than the em economy,,so that means wages fall downnto em subsistence levels.,That means ems have to be workingnmost of the time.,So that meansnthis is what ems usually see:,beautiful and luxurious, but desks --,they're working most of the time.,Now, a subsistence wage scenario,nyou might think, is exotic and strange,,but it's actually the usual casenin human history,,and it's how pretty muchnall wild animals have ever lived,,so we know what humans donin this situation.,Humans basically donwhat it takes to survive,,and this is what lets me saynso much about the em world.,When creatures are rich, like you,,you have to know a lotnabout what they want,to figure out what they do.,When creatures are poor,,you know that they mostly donwhat it takes to survive. 
 So we've been talking about the em worldnfrom the point of view of the ems --,now, let's step backnand look at their whole world.,First, the em world growsnmuch faster than ours,,roughly a hundred times faster.,So the amount of changenwe would experience in a century or two,,they would experience in a year or two.,And I'm not really willing to projectnthis age much beyond that,,because plausibly by then something elsenwill happen, I don't know what.,Second, the typical emulationnruns even faster,,roughly a thousand times human speed.,So for them, they experiencenthousands of years in this year or two,,and for them, the world around themnis actually changing more slowly,than your world seems to change for you.,Third, ems are crammed togethernin a small number of very dense cities.,This is not only how they seenthemselves in virtual reality,,it's also how they actually arenphysically crammed together.,So at em speeds, physical travelnfeels really painfully slow,,so most em cities are self-sufficient,,most war is cyber war,,and most of the rest of the earthnaway from the em cities,is left to the humans, because the emsnreally aren't that interested in it. 
 Speaking of humans,,you were wanting to hear about that.,Humans must retire, at once, for good.,They just can't compete.,Now, humans start out owningnall of the capital in this world.,The economy grows very fast,ntheir wealth grows very fast.,Humans get rich, collectively.,As you may know, most humans todayndon't actually own that much,besides their ability to work,,so between now and then,nthey need to acquire sufficient assets,,insurance or sharing arrangements,,or they may starve.,I highly recommend avoiding this outcome. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, you might wonder,,why would ems let humans exist?,Why not kill them, take their stuff?,But notice we have manynunproductive retirees around us today,,and we don't kill themnand take their stuff. 
 (Laughter) 
 In part, that's because it would disruptnthe institutions we share with them.,Other groups would wonder who's next,,so plausibly, ems may well let humansnretire in peace during the age of em.,You should worry more thatnthe age of em only lasts a year or two,and you don't know what happens next. 
 Ems are very much like humans,,but they are not like the typical human.,The typical em is a copynof the few hundred most productive humans.,So in fact, they are as elite,ncompared to the typical human,,as the typical billionaire,nNobel Prize winner,,Olympic gold medalist, head of state.,Ems look on humansnperhaps with nostalgia and gratitude,,but not so much respect,,which is, if you think about it,nhow you think about your ancestors.,We know many things about how humansndiffer in terms of productivity.,We can just use thosento predict features of ems --,for example, they tend to be smart,nconscientious, hard-working,,married, religious, middle-aged.,These are features of ems. 
 Em world also contains enormous variety.,Not only does it continue on with mostnof the kinds of variety that humans do,,including variety of industrynand profession,,they also have many new kinds of variety,,and one of the most importantnis mind speed.,Ems can plausibly go from human speed,up to a million timesnfaster than human speed,,and down to a billion timesnslower than human speed.,Faster ems tend to havenmarkers of high status.,They embody more wealth.nThey win arguments.,They sit at premium locations.,Slower ems are mostly retirees,,and they are like the ghostsnof our literature.,If you recall, ghosts are all around us --,you can interact with themnif you pay the price.,But they don't know much,nthey can't influence much,,and they're obsessed with the past,nso what's the point? 
 (Laughter) 
 Ems also have more varietynin the structure of their lives.,This is your life: you startnand you end, really simple.,This is the life of an em,,who every day splits offnsome short-term copies,to do short-term tasks and then end.,We'll talk more aboutnthose short term versions in a moment,,but they are much more efficient,because they don't have to restnfor the next day.,This em is more opportunistic.,They make more copies of themselvesnwhen there's more demand for that.,They don't know which waynthe future's going. 
 This is an em designer,,who conceives of a large system,and then breaks recursively into copiesnwho elaborate that,,so ems can implementnlarger, more coherent designs.,This an emulation plumber,who remembers that every day,nfor the last 20 years,,they only ever workedntwo hours a day, a life of leisure.,But what really happened is,nevery day they had a thousand copies,,each of whom did a two-hour plumbing job,,and only one of themnwent on to the next day.,Objectively, they're workingnwell over 99 percent of the time.,Subjectively, they rememberna life of leisure. 
 (Laughter) 
 This, again, is you.nYou start and you end.,This could be younif at the start of party,,you took a drug that meantnyou would not remember that party,ever after that day.,Some people do this, I'm told.,Toward the end of the party,,will you say to yourself,n"I'm about to die, this is terrible.,That person tomorrow isn't me,nbecause they won't remember what I do.",Or you could say, "I will go on tomorrow.nI just won't remember what I did.",This is an em who splits offna short-term copy,to do a short-term task and then end.,They have the same twonattitude possibilities.,They can say, "I'm a new short-termncreature with a short life. I hate this.",Or "I'm a part of a larger creaturenwho won't remember this part.",I predict they'll haventhat second attitude,,not because it's philosophically correct,nbut because it helps them get along. 
 Today, if the president saysnwe must invade Iraq,,and you say, "Why?",and they say, "State secret,",you're not sure if you can trust them,,but for ems, a copy of the presidentnand a copy of you can go inside a safe,,explain all their secret reasons,,and then one bit comes outnfrom your copy to yourself,,telling you if you were convinced.,So now you can knownthere is a good reason. 
 I know you guys are all eagernto evaluate this world.,You're eager to decidenif you love it or hate it.,But think: your ancestorsnfrom thousands of years ago,would have loved or hated your world,based on the first few thingsnthey heard about it,,because your worldnis really just weird.,So before judging a strange future world,nyou should really learn a lot about it,,maybe read a whole book about it,,and then, if you don't like it,nwork to change it. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'd like to start with a simple question:,Why do the poor makenso many poor decisions?,I know it's a harsh question,,but take a look at the data.,The poor borrow more, save less,,smoke more, exercise less, drink more,and eat less healthfully.,Why? 
 Well, the standard explanation,was once summed up by the BritishnPrime Minister, Margaret Thatcher.,And she called povertyn"a personality defect." 
 (Laughter) 
 A lack of character, basically. 
 Now, I'm sure not many of younwould be so blunt.,But the idea that there's somethingnwrong with the poor themselves,is not restricted to Mrs. Thatcher.,Some of you may believe that the poornshould be held responsible,for their own mistakes.,And others may argue that we shouldnhelp them to make better decisions.,But the underlying assumption is the same:,there's something wrong with them.,If we could just change them,,if we could just teach themnhow to live their lives,,if they would only listen.,And to be honest,,this was what I thought for a long time.,It was only a few years agonthat I discovered,that everything I thought I knewnabout poverty was wrong. 
 It all started when I accidentallynstumbled upon a paper,by a few American psychologists.,They had traveled 8,000 miles,nall the way to India,,for a fascinating study.,And it was an experimentnwith sugarcane farmers.,You should know that these farmersncollect about 60 percent,of their annual income all at once,,right after the harvest.,This means that they're relativelynpoor one part of the year,and rich the other.,The researchers asked them to donan IQ test before and after the harvest.,What they subsequently discoveredncompletely blew my mind.,The farmers scored much worsenon the test before the harvest.,The effects of livingnin poverty, it turns out,,correspond to losing 14 points of IQ.,Now, to give you an idea,,that's comparablento losing a night's sleep,or the effects of alcoholism. 
 A few months later,nI heard that Eldar Shafir,,a professor at Princeton Universitynand one of the authors of this study,,was coming over to Holland, where I live.,So we met up in Amsterdam,to talk about his revolutionarynnew theory of poverty.,And I can sum it up in just two words:,scarcity mentality.,It turns out that peoplenbehave differently,when they perceive a thing to be scarce.,And what that thing isndoesn't much matter --,whether it's not enough time,nmoney or food. 
 You all know this feeling,,when you've got too much to do,,or when you've put off breaking for lunch,and your blood sugar takes a dive.,This narrows your focusnto your immediate lack --,to the sandwich you've got to have now,,the meeting that's startingnin five minutes,or the bills that havento be paid tomorrow.,So the long-term perspectivengoes out the window.,You could compare it to a new computer,that's running 10 heavy programs at once.,It gets slower and slower, making errors.,Eventually, it freezes --,not because it's a bad computer,,but because it has too much to do at once.,The poor have the same problem.,They're not making dumb decisionsnbecause they are dumb,,but because they're living in a context,in which anyone would make dumb decisions. 
 So suddenly I understood,why so many of our anti-povertynprograms don't work.,Investments in education, for example,nare often completely ineffective.,Poverty is not a lack of knowledge.,A recent analysis of 201 studies,on the effectivenessnof money-management training,came to the conclusionnthat it has almost no effect at all.,Now, don't get me wrong --,this is not to say the poorndon't learn anything --,they can come out wiser for sure.,But it's not enough.,Or as Professor Shafir told me,,"It's like teaching someone to swim,and then throwing them in a stormy sea." 
 I still remember sitting there,,perplexed.,And it struck me,that we could have figurednthis all out decades ago.,I mean, these psychologists didn't neednany complicated brain scans;,they only had to measure the farmer's IQ,,and IQ tests were inventednmore than 100 years ago.,Actually, I realized I had read aboutnthe psychology of poverty before.,George Orwell, one of the greatestnwriters who ever lived,,experienced povertynfirsthand in the 1920s.,"The essence of poverty,"nhe wrote back then,,is that it "annihilates the future.",And he marveled at, quote,,"How people take it for grantednthey have the right to preach at you,and pray over you,as soon as your income fallsnbelow a certain level." 
 Now, those words are every bitnas resonant today.,The big question is, of course:,What can be done?,Modern economists havena few solutions up their sleeves.,We could help the poornwith their paperwork,or send them a text messagento remind them to pay their bills.,This type of solution is hugely popularnwith modern politicians,,mostly because,,well, they cost next to nothing.,These solutions are, I think,na symbol of this era,in which we so often treat the symptoms,,but ignore the underlying cause. 
 So I wonder:,Why don't we just change the contextnin which the poor live?,Or, going back to our computer analogy:,Why keep tinkering aroundnwith the software,when we can easily solve the problemnby installing some extra memory instead?,At that point, Professor Shafirnresponded with a blank look.,And after a few seconds, he said,,"Oh, I get it.,You mean you want to just hand outnmore money to the poor,to eradicate poverty.,Uh, sure, that'd be great.,But I'm afraid that brandnof left-wing politics,you've got in Amsterdam --,it doesn't exist in the States." 
 But is this reallynan old-fashioned, leftist idea?,I remembered reading about an old plan --,something that has been proposednby some of history's leading thinkers.,The philosopher Thomas Morenfirst hinted at it in his book, "Utopia,",more than 500 years ago.,And its proponents have spannednthe spectrum from the left to the right,,from the civil rights campaigner,nMartin Luther King,,to the economist Milton Friedman.,And it's an incredibly simple idea:,basic income guarantee. 
 What it is?,Well, that's easy.,It's a monthly grant, enough to paynfor your basic needs:,food, shelter, education.,It's completely unconditional,,so no one's going to tell younwhat you have to do for it,,and no one's going to tell younwhat you have to do with it.,The basic incomenis not a favor, but a right.,There's absolutely no stigma attached.,So as I learned about the truennature of poverty,,I couldn't stop wondering:,Is this the ideanwe've all been waiting for?,Could it really be that simple?,And in the three years that followed,,I read everything I could findnabout basic income.,I researched the dozens of experiments,that have been conductednall over the globe,,and it didn't take long before I stumblednupon a story of a town,that had done it --nhad actually eradicated poverty.,But then ...,nearly everyone forgot about it. 
 This story starts in Dauphin, Canada.,In 1974, everybody in this small townnwas guaranteed a basic income,,ensuring that no one fellnbelow the poverty line.,At the start of the experiment,,an army of researchersndescended on the town.,For four years, all went well.,But then a new governmentnwas voted into power,,and the new Canadian cabinet sawnlittle point to the expensive experiment.,So when it became clear there wasnno money left to analyze the results,,the researchers decided to packntheir files away in some 2,000 boxes.,Twenty-five years went by,,and then Evelyn Forget,na Canadian professor,,found the records.,For three years, she subjected the datanto all manner of statistical analysis,,and no matter what she tried,,the results were the same every time:,the experiment had beenna resounding success. 
 Evelyn Forget discovered,that the people in Dauphinnhad not only become richer,but also smarter and healthier.,The school performance of kidsnimproved substantially.,The hospitalization rate decreasednby as much as 8.5 percent.,Domestic violence incidents were down,,as were mental health complaints.,And people didn't quit their jobs.,The only ones who worked a little lessnwere new mothers and students --,who stayed in school longer.,Similar results have since been found,in countless other experimentsnaround the globe,,from the US to India. 
 So ...,here's what I've learned.,When it comes to poverty,,we, the rich, should stopnpretending we know best.,We should stop sending shoesnand teddy bears to the poor,,to people we have never met.,And we should get rid of the vastnindustry of paternalistic bureaucrats,when we could simplynhand over their salaries,to the poor they're supposed to help. 
 (Applause) 
 Because, I mean, the greatnthing about money,is that people can use itnto buy things they need,instead of things that self-appointednexperts think they need.,Just imagine how many brilliant scientistsnand entrepreneurs and writers,,like George Orwell,,are now withering away in scarcity.,Imagine how much energynand talent we would unleash,if we got rid of poverty once and for all.,I believe that a basic income would worknlike venture capital for the people.,And we can't afford not to do it,,because poverty is hugely expensive.,Just look at the cost of child povertynin the US, for example.,It's estimated at 500 billionndollars each year,,in terms of higher health carenspending, higher dropout rates,,and more crime.,Now, this is an incredible wastenof human potential. 
 But let's talk aboutnthe elephant in the room.,How could we ever affordna basic income guarantee?,Well, it's actually a lot cheapernthan you may think.,What they did in Dauphin is finance itnwith a negative income tax.,This means that your income is topped up,as soon as you fallnbelow the poverty line.,And in that scenario,,according to our economists'nbest estimates,,for a net cost of 175 billion --,a quarter of US military spending,none percent of GDP --,you could lift all impoverished Americansnabove the poverty line.,You could actually eradicate poverty.,Now, that should be our goal. 
 (Applause) 
 The time for small thoughtsnand little nudges is past.,I really believe that the time has comenfor radical new ideas,,and basic income is so much morenthan just another policy.,It is also a complete rethinknof what work actually is.,And in that sense,,it will not only free the poor,,but also the rest of us. 
 Nowadays, millions of people feel,that their jobs have littlenmeaning or significance.,A recent poll among 230,000 employees,in 142 countries,found that only 13 percent of workersnactually like their job.,And another poll found that as muchnas 37 percent of British workers,have a job that they thinkndoesn't even need to exist.,It's like Brad Pitt says in "Fight Club,","Too often we're working jobs we hatenso we can buy shit we don't need." 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, don't get me wrong --,I'm not talking about the teachersnand the garbagemen,and the care workers here.,If they stopped working,,we'd be in trouble.,I'm talking about all those well-paidnprofessionals with excellent résumés,who earn their money doing ...,strategic transactor peer-to-peer meetings,while brainstorming the valuenadd-on of disruptive co-creation,in the network society. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Or something like that.,Just imagine again how muchntalent we're wasting,,simply because we tell our kidsnthey'll have to "earn a living.",Or think of what a math whiz workingnat Facebook lamented a few years ago:,"The best minds of my generation,are thinking about hownto make people click ads." 
 I'm a historian.,And if history teaches us anything,,it is that things could be different.,There is nothing inevitable,about the way we structured our societynand economy right now.,Ideas can and do change the world.,And I think that especiallynin the past few years,,it has become abundantly clear,that we cannot stick to the status quo --,that we need new ideas. 
 I know that many of younmay feel pessimistic,about a future of rising inequality,,xenophobia,and climate change.,But it's not enoughnto know what we're against.,We also need to be for something.,Martin Luther King didn't say,n"I have a nightmare." 
 (Laughter) 
 He had a dream. 
 (Applause) 
 So ...,here's my dream:,I believe in a future,where the value of your worknis not determined,by the size of your paycheck,,but by the amount of happiness you spread,and the amount of meaning you give.,I believe in a future,where the point of education is notnto prepare you for another useless job,but for a life well-lived.,I believe in a future,where an existencenwithout poverty is not a privilege,but a right we all deserve.,So here we are.,Here we are.,We've got the research,nwe've got the evidence,and we've got the means. 
 Now, more than 500 years after Thomas Morenfirst wrote about a basic income,,and 100 years after George Orwellndiscovered the true nature of poverty,,we all need to change our worldview,,because povertynis not a lack of character.,Poverty is a lack of cash. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I want us to startnby thinking about this device,,the phone that's very likelynin your pockets right now.,Over 40 percent of Americans ncheck their phones,within five minutesnof waking up every morning.,And then they look at itnanother 50 times during the day.,Grownups consider this devicento be a necessity. 
 But now I want you to imagine itnin the hands of a three-year-old,,and as a society, we get anxious.,Parents are very worried,that this device is going to stuntntheir children's social growth;,that it's going to keep themnfrom getting up and moving;,that somehow,,this is going to disrupt childhood.,So, I want to challenge this attitude.,I can envision a future,where we would be excited to seena preschooler interacting with a screen.,These screens can get kidsnup and moving even more.,They have the power to tell us morenabout what a child is learning,than a standardized test can.,And here's the really crazy thought:,I believe that these screensnhave the power,to prompt more real-life conversations,between kids and their parents. 
 Now, I was perhapsnan unlikely champion for this cause.,I studied children's literature,because I was going to worknwith kids and books.,But about 20 years ago,,I had an experience that shifted my focus.,I was helping lead a research studynabout preschoolers and websites.,And I walked in and was assignedna three-year-old named Maria.,Maria had actually never seenna computer before.,So the first thing I had to donwas teach her how to use the mouse,,and when I opened up the screen,nshe moved it across the screen,,and she stopped on a characternnamed X the Owl.,And when she did that,,the owl lifted his wing and waved at her.,Maria dropped the mouse,npushed back from the table, leaped up,and started wavingnfrantically back at him.,Her connection to that character,was visceral.,This wasn't a passive screen experience.,This was a human experience.,And it was exactly appropriatenfor a three-year-old. 
 I've now worked at PBS Kidsnfor more than 15 years,,and my work there is focused onnharnessing the power of technology,as a positive in children's lives.,I believe that as a society,nwe're missing a big opportunity.,We're letting our fear and our skepticism,about these devices,hold us back from realizingntheir potential,in our children's lives. 
 Fear about kids and technologynis nothing new;,we've been here before.,Over 50 years ago, the debate was ragingnabout the newly dominant media:,the television.,That box in the living room?,It might be separating kidsnfrom one another.,It might keep them awaynfrom the outside world.,But this is the moment when Fred Rogers,,the long-running hostnof "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood,",challenged societynto look at television as a tool,,a tool that could promotenemotional growth.,Here's what he did:,he looked out from the screen,nand he held a conversation,,as if he were speakingnto each child individually,about feelings.,And then he would pause,and let them think about them.,You can see his influencenacross the media landscape today,,but at the time, this was revolutionary.,He shifted the way we looked at televisionnin the lives of children. 
 Today it's not just one box.,Kids are surrounded by devices.,And I'm also a parent -- I understandnthis feeling of anxiety.,But I want us to looknat three common fears,that parents have,,and see if we can shift our focus,to the opportunity that's in each of them. 
 So.,Fear number one:,"Screens are passive.,This is going to keep our kidsnfrom getting up and moving.",Chris Kratt and Martin Krattnare zoologist brothers,who host a show about animalsncalled "Wild Kratts.",And they approached the PBS team to say,,"Can we do something with those cameras,that are built into every device now?,Could those cameras capturena very natural kid play pattern --,pretending to be animals?" 
 So we started with bats.,And when kids came in to play this game,,they loved seeing themselvesnon-screen with wings.,But my favorite part of this,,when the game was overnand we turned off the screens?,The kids kept being bats.,They kept flying around the room,,they kept veering left and rightnto catch mosquitoes.,And they remembered things.,They remembered that bats fly at night.,And they remembered that when bats sleep,,they hang upside downnand fold their wings in.,This game definitely got kidsnup and moving.,But also, now when kids go outside,,do they look at a bird and think,,"How does a bird flyndifferently than I flew,when I was a bat?",The digital technology promptednembodied learning,that kids can now take out into the world. 
 Fear number two:,"Playing games on these screensnis just a waste of time.,It's going to distract childrennfrom their education.",Game developers know,that you can learn a lotnabout a player's skill,by looking at the back-end data:,Where did a player pause?,Where did they make a few mistakesnbefore they found the right answer?,My team wanted to take that tool setnand apply it to academic learning. 
 Our producer in Boston, WGBH,,created a series of Curious George games,focused on math.,And researchers came in and hadn80 preschoolers play these games.,They then gave all 80nof those preschoolers,a standardized math test.,We could see early on,that these gamesnwere actually helping kids,understand some key skills.,But our partners at UCLAnwanted us to dig deeper.,They focus on data analysisnand student assessment.,And they wanted to takenthat back-end game-play data,and see if they could use itnto predict a child's math scores.,So they made a neural net --nthey essentially trained the computer,to use this data,,and here are the results.,This is a subset of the children'snstandardized math scores.,And this,is the computer's predictionnof each child's score,,based on playingnsome Curious George games.,The prediction is astonishingly accurate,,especially considering the factnthat these games weren't built,for assessment.,The team that did this studynbelieves that games like these,can teach us morenabout a child's cognitive learning,than a standardized test can.,What if games could reducentesting time in the classroom?,What if they could reduce testing anxiety?,How could they give teachersnsnapshots of insight,to help them better focusntheir individualized learning? 
 So the third fear I want to address,is the one that I thinknis often the biggest.,And that's this:,"These screens are isolating menfrom my child.",Let's play out a scenario.,Let's say that you are a parent,,and you need 25 minutesnof uninterrupted time,to get dinner ready.,And in order to do that,nyou hand a tablet to your three-year-old.,Now, this is a momentnwhere you probably feel very guilty,about what you just did. 
 But now imagine this:,Twenty minutes later,nyou receive a text message.,on that cell phonenthat's always within arm's reach.,And it says: "Alex just matchednfive rhyming words.,Ask him to play this game with you.,Can you think of a wordnthat rhymes with 'cat'?,Or how about 'ball'?",In our studies, when parents receivensimple tips like these,,they felt empowered.,They were so excited,to play these gamesnat the dinner table with their kids.,And the kids loved it, too.,Not only did it feel like magicnthat their parents knew,what they had been playing,,kids love to play gamesnwith their parents.,Just the act of talking to kidsnabout their media,can be incredibly powerful. 
 Last summer, Texas Tech Universitynpublished a study,that the show "Daniel Tiger'snNeighborhood" could promote,the development of empathy among children.,But there was a really importantncatch to this study:,the greatest benefit was onlynwhen parents talked to kids,about what they watched.,Neither just watching,nor just talking about it was enough;,it was the combination that was key.,So when I read this study,,I started thinking about,how rarely parents of preschoolersnactually talk to kids about the content,of what they're playingnand what they're watching. 
 And so I decided to try itnwith my four-year-old.,I said,,"Were you playing a car gamenearlier today?",And Benjamin perked up and said,,"Yes! And did you seenthat I made my car out of a pickle?,It was really hard to open the trunk." 
 (Laughter) 
 This hilarious conversationnabout what was fun in the game,and what could have been better,continued all the waynto school that morning. 
 I'm not here to suggest to younthat all digital media is great for kids.,There are legitimate reasonsnfor us to be concerned,about the current statenof children's content,on these screens.,And it's right for usnto be thinking about balance:,Where do screens fitnagainst all the other things,that a child needs to donto learn and to grow?,But when we fixate on our fears about it,,we forget a really major point,,and that is, that kids are livingnin the same world that we live in,,the world where the grownupsncheck their phones,more than 50 times a day. 
 Screens are a part of children's lives.,And if we pretend that they aren't,,or if we get overwhelmed by our fear,,kids are never going to learnnhow and why to use them.,What if we start raising our expectations,for this media?,What if we start talking to kids regularly,about the content on these screens?,What if we start lookingnfor the positive impacts,that this technology can havenin our children's lives?,That's when the potential of these toolsncan become a reality. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Gayle King: Have a seat, Serena Williams,,or should we say, have a seat, mom. 
 (Cheers) 
 So no doubt, you guys are like me.,You saw the release of Serena,in that great yellownbathing suit last week,and when I saw it,nall I could think of was,,"Gosh, why couldn't she have waitedntil we sat onstage for TED?",I was very selfish, I know.,So I asked you about that picture,,and you said nobody wasnsupposed to see that picture.,What do you mean? 
 Serena Williams: Well,nactually, it was an accident.,I was on vacation,njust taking some time for myself,,and I have this thingnwhere I've been checking my status,and taking pictures every weeknto see how far along I'm going -- 
 GK: And sharing it with friends, maybe? 
 SW: No, actuallynI have just been saving it,,and I didn't really tell a lot of people,,to be quite honest,,and I'd been saving it,,and you know how social media is,nyou press the wrong button and -- 
 (Laughter) 
 GK: And there it was. 
 SW: So 30 minutes later --nmy phone doesn't ring that much --,and 30 minutes later,nI missed like four calls,,and I'm like, that's weird,,and then I picked it upnand I was like, oh no.,But it was a good moment.,I was gonna wait literallynjust five or six more days -- that's OK. 
 GK: I know, because it was weird,nSerena, because it only said 20 weeks,,so it's not like there wasna whole lot of information on it. 
 SW: Exactly, so that'snwhat I've been doing all this time.,I've been just tracking it.,18, 19 -- every weeknI'd just take a picture and save it,,and I've been so good about it,,and this was the one time that I slipped. 
 GK: There you go. Well, congratulations. 
 SW: Yes, thank you. 
 GK: It really is OK.nWhen you heard the news,,were you excited?nWere you afraid? Were you worried?,That you were pregnant, I mean. 
 SW: So I heard it two days beforenthe beginning of the Australian Open,,which is one of the biggest grand slams. 
 GK: You found out two days before? 
 SW: Yeah, so it wasntwo days before, and I knew.,I was nervous.,I wasn't quite sure what to think,,but I just knew that at that moment,it was really important for mento just focus right there,at the Australian Open,,and I was definitely not sure what to do.,I was like, can I play?,I know it's very dangerous, maybe,nsometimes in the first 12 weeks or so,,so I had a lot of questions. 
 GK: But not only did you play,nMs. Williams, you won. 
 (Cheers) 
 SW: Yeah.,May I just say, 23 grand slams to you. 
 SW: Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 GK: While pregnant! 
 SW: Well, I was lookingnfor another handicap, so ... no. 
 GK: Did you play differently that game,nknowing you were pregnant? 
 SW: I did. It wasn't very easy.,You hear all these storiesnabout people when they're pregnant,,they get sick and they get tired. 
 GK: Have you had morning sickness? 
 SW: No, I've been so fortunatenand so I haven't.,But they get really tirednand they get really stressed out,,and I had to really take all that energy,,put it in a paper bag, so to say,,and throw it away,,because I really feltnlike I didn't have time,to deal with any extra emotions,nany extra anything,,because pregnant or not, no one knew,,and I was supposed to win that tournament,as I am every tournament that I show up.,I am expected to win,,and if I don't win,nit's actually much bigger news. 
 GK: Yeah, when you don't win,nthat's a big story. 
 SW: Yes, so for me,nI had to really take anything negative,and any emotionsnthat I was feeling at that point,and kind of just bottle them up,and really figure outnwhat the next step for me to do was. 
 GK: You have a lot of support.nYou have a lot of love.,Even when I was coming here,npeople stopped me at the airport.,I was saying to the flight attendant,nthe pilot, "Guess where I'm going?",They said, "Oh my God,nwe're so glad she's pregnant.",But then you always haventhese cranky Yankees.,On the way over here, somebodynwas telling me about Ilie Nastase,,who said some very unkind, inappropriate,ndare I say racial things.,You have responded to him.,I'm not even goingnto dignify what he said,,but you responded. Why did you respond? 
 SW: Well, I think there arenvery inappropriate comments,,and not only that, I've beennreally supportive of my peers,and the people that I've worked with.,I've been a pro for almost 20 years,,and so for me, it's really importantnto hold women up,,and it's something that these young women,,they'll come to the locker room,nthey'll want to take pictures with me,,and for me, it's just like,,I want to be able to be a good leadernand a good example for them.,So not only -- 
 (Applause) 
 Not only did he have rude thingsnto say about me and my peers,,I felt it was importantnfor us to stand up for each other,and to stand up for myself.,And at that point it wasnreally important for me to say,,like, I'm not afraid,nI'm not going anywhere,,but this is inappropriate,,and there's time and there'sna place for everything.,And that reallynwasn't the time and the place. 
 GK: We cut the part where you saidnyou're not going anywhere,,because you'll be 36 in September.nBaby's coming, 36.,And your coach saidnage is always important,,but in tennis it's very important,,but he has no doubtnthat you're coming back.,Have you thought, am I coming back?,Will I take some time off?,I know the women on the tour are saying,,"How long does it take to have a baby?nTwo years will she be gone?",What are you thinking? 
 SW: Well, I'm always tryingnto defy the odds, you know,,so for me everything is really mental.,I definitely plan on coming back.nI'm not done yet.,I'm really inspired by my sister.,She's a year older than me,nand that's something that --,if she's still playing, I know I can play. 
 (Laughter) 
 And there's so many -- Roger Federer,nhe's a little bit older than me,and he's still winning everything,nso I'm like, I know I can do that too.,So that's been so inspiring to me,nespecially recently,,and I know thatnit's something I want to do.,And my story is definitely not over yet.,I was talking to my coach about it,,and we were talking aboutnhow this is just a new part of my life,,and my baby's going to be in the stands,and hopefully cheering for me,nnot crying too much. 
 GK: No, you wrote a beautifulnletter to your baby yesterday,that you said -- from the oldest mommynto the youngest one,,to the oldest, to the youngest,nI can't wait for you to get here.,A lot of people feel that.,I saw you about a year ago,nbecause I think about your life, Serena.,You've had three life-changing thingsnin a six-month time:,pregnant, huge win, fell in love.,And when I saw you last year,,I was saying, "How'snyour love life? Da da da.",You said, "I met a guy.nHe's a nerdy, kinda geeky guy.,You won't know who he is.",I said, "What's his name?" 
 SW: I remember talkingnto you about that, yes. 
 GK: And you said, "Alexis Ohanian."nI said, "I know him!" He's awesome.,But I would never put younwith a nerdy geek,,and you said, you neither. 
 SW: I'm going to be honestnwith you, I didn't either,,but it's been the best thing for me. 
 GK: The best thing why?,Does that look like a nerdy geek?,Look at the shirt. 
 (Laughter) 
 No, he's a very nice guy. 
 SW: You can tell he's into technology. 
 GK: He's a very, very nice guy.,I like him very much.,So how did he succeednwhen others have failed?,How was he the one that you knew,nthis is the one for me? 
 SW: Well, I'm not going to say that,,but ... 
 (Laughter) 
 GK: Say it, Serena, say it! 
 SW: Well ... 
 (Laughter) 
 Yes. 
 (Applause) 
 GK: But you know what I mean. 
 SW: He is very loving and he's very kind,nand my mom says he's very considerate,,and when she said that to me,,I was like, you know, he really is,,and it's the little things that reallynmake a huge difference in life. 
 GK: Like? 
 SW: Something simple.,My fashion company,nwe have a show every year,,so in our show last year,nI was running around like crazy,,because I do everything for the show,,and everything for it,,so I was running around like crazy,,and he, it was a simple gesturenof this shirt that he had,,and he just wanted to make surenthat I had the same one,,and it was -- it's a weird story.,It was better in person, I promise. 
 GK: Was it a wonderful proposal?,Or was it a Beyoncé song?,"If you like it then younought to put a ring on it"?,Were you feeling pressure to get married?,Did you know it was coming? 
 SW: Yeah, I actuallynnever felt pressure to get married,and I can't saynI'm the marrying type of person.,I really love my life.,I love my freedom.,I heard that kind of changes.,But I love everything that I do,,and I love my career,,and I always felt like I didn't wantnanything to interfere with that.,I've actually been so career-oriented,and in fact, when he proposed,,I was almost angry.,Not almost. I was angry,,because it was rightnin the middle of my training season,,and I said, "I gotta winnthe Australian Open.,I can't fly to Rome.",Because he wanted to take me to Rome,,and I said, "I can't. I gotta win.",But that's how focused I was. 
 GK: This is a girl that says,n"No, I can't go to Rome." OK. 
 SW: But I was really focusednon reaching my goals,and I knew at that point there wasnone player that I wanted to pass.,I wanted to pass Steffi Graf's record,,and that really meant a lot to me,,and when I put my mind to something,,I really am determined to reach it,no matter what. 
 GK: You know, you said that for you --,I've heard you saynthat winning is addictive to you. 
 SW: It is. 
 GK: What do you mean? 
 SW: I feel like winning for menis superaddictive.,I feel like once you experience it,,you always want to get that feeling again,,and when I won my first championship,nI was only 17 years old,,but I never forgot that feeling,,and I feel like every time I win one,,I want to reach that feelingnof your first championship.,There's really no feelingnin the world like that.,And it's like, all these years of training,and being a little kid and playing,,and then winningnis a wonderful experience.,So for me I've always feltnlike I loved that feeling,,and obviously I don't likenthe feeling of losing. I feel like -- 
 GK: No, in fact, people close to younsay you're a very bad loser. 
 SW: I'm not the best loser. 
 GK: That you're very, very, very bad.,Listen, no athlete,nno champion likes to lose.,I get that.,But they say when it comes to losing,nyou are very, very, very bad at it. 
 (Laughter) 
 SW: I'm number one at losing too,nso you know, that's all I can say. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 GK: I'm always curious about the dynamicnbetween you and Venus,,because everybody that knows younand has followed the story,knows that you two are very close,,and you always bring your A gamenin whatever you do,,but I often wonder,nwhen you're playing her,,do you bring your A- gamenbecause you want to do something for her,or do you bring your A++ gamenbecause you want to crush her.,Is it harder for younplaying her or easier? 
 SW: Well, playing Venusnis like playing myself,,because we grew up playing each other,nwe grew up practicing together.,And it was somethingnthat has been difficult,,because she's my toughest opponent.,She's tall, she's fast,,she hits hard like me, she serves like me.,It's really like playing a wall. 
 GK: She knows you. 
 SW: She knows where I'm hittingnthe ball before I hit it,,so it's something that is not very easy,,but it's really about,nwhen I go out there,,I really have to shut down my mindnand I have to say to myself,,"You know what?,I'm just playing a great player,nbut today I have to be better.,I don't care who it is,nif it's my sister or it's my friend,,today is the day I have to show upnand I have to be better,and I have to want it morenthan anyone else at this moment,anywhere on this world." 
 GK: So never on the courtndo you fall back for Venus?,Because, you know,nit was always Venus and Serena. 
 SW: Yes. 
 GK: And now baby sisternhas surpassed older sister.,Do you feel guilt about that?,Do you feel joy in that?,Is that a difficult position for you? 
 SW: I don't feel anything in there.,In my life, it still and forevernis always going to be Venus and Serena.,She's really love of my life,nshe's my best friend,,she's my soul mate.,I mean --,There's pictures of her pushing me,,really low-quality picturesnor else I would have shared them,,of her pushing menin a stroller on a tennis court,,and she always took care of me.,I used to spend all of my allowancenmoney on the ice cream truck and stuff,,and she would take her moneynand give it to me at school,and make sure I had something to eatnand she would go without,,and that's the kind of personnshe actually is,since I've always known her.,So we always have this incrediblenrespect for each other,and this incredible love,,and I think it's important for peoplento realize you can be successful,but you can still havena wonderful relationship.,On the court we are mortal enemies,,but the second we shake hands,nwe are best friends again.,And if I lose, it might bena day later for me,,but for Venus -- 
 (Laughter) 
 GK: There's never a time on the courtnwhere you hit the ball,and say, "That's for seventh gradenwhen you did the blah blah blah"?,You never have any moment like that? 
 SW: I feel like she should haventhose moments,,because she's never donenanything bad to me,,but I'm the youngest.nI'm the younger sister. 
 GK: Serena, she's never donenanything bad to you? Really?,I have three sisters.nI can think of some stuff I've done bad. 
 SW: Unless she brainwashed mento forget them. 
 GK: No, but the love you have for hernI know is very pure. I know that. 
 SW: Yes. GK: I know that. 
 SW: We were always brought upnto be superclose,,and we are incredibly close.,Not only her.,I have three other sisters as well,nand we were always so close. 
 GK: So before a big match,nthe two of you don't get together,and say, look, we're goingnto go out there and -- there's nothing? 
 SW: Well, it's funny.nBefore the Australian Open,,we were in the locker room together,,and I always pick on her, so I pulled outnmy camera while she was changing.,I started taking pictures of her,nwhich is totally inappropriate,,but she was so mad at me.,She's like, "Serena, stop!"nAnd I was just laughing at her.,But that's the kind of relationshipnthat we have, and like I said,,the second we step on the court,,it was like, we werendefinitely mortal enemies,,but the second we stepped off,nand moments before, we're just --,It is what it is,nbecause at the end of the day,,she'll always be my sister.,I'm not going to play Australia in --,Well, who knows,nI've been playing forever,,but I don't thinknI'll be playing in 50 years, say?,Let's be safe and say 50 years. 
 GK: I don't know, Serena.nThere's never been anybody like you.,When you think about it,nnever been anybody,who has intersectedngender and race the way you have,,the dominance that you havenand the scrutiny that you have.,And when you were growing up,ndid you say, "I want to be like that"?,Because now little girlsnare looking at you,saying, "I want to be like that.",Who was the "I wantnto be like that" for you? 
 SW: Well, it's interesting,nand I'm glad you brought that up.,For me, when I grew up,nI always wanted to be the best,,and I said, if you want to be the best,nyou've got to emulate the best.,So when I started to go on tournwhen I was really young,,I would see Steffi Graf,nI would see Monica Seles,,and I would even see Pete Sampras,,and I would see what they did,,and I noticed that Steffi and Monica,didn't really talknto a lot of the other players,,and they kind of were on their own,,and they were just so focused,and I would see Pete Sampras,nthe technique that he did,,and I was like, "I want to do that.",So I did that, and I feltnthat to be the best,,and if you want to be the best,,you have to hang around people,and you have to look at peoplenthat are the best,,because you're not going to be the best,if you're looking at someonenthat's not at the top level. 
 GK: People saynnobody works as hard as you. 
 SW: I'm a very hard worker.nGK: That's what I heard. 
 SW: People say, "Oh,nshe's talented, she's athletic.",Actually, I wasn't.nI was really small for my age.,I grew up when I got older,,and I had to work really hard,,and I think one of the reasonsnwhy I fight so hard and I work so hard,is because I wasnreally, really, really small. 
 GK: Yeah.,You are no longer small. 
 SW: No, I'm fully grown now.,But I was small when I was really youngnfor whatever reason.,I think Venus maybe ate all the Wheaties. 
 GK: You know, the other thingnpeople talk about is your body.,Your body brings mennand women to their knees.,And I mean in a good way.,A lot has been made about your body.,It's a work of art,nit's masculine, it's glorious,,there's never been anything like it.,Did you have body issuesnwhen you were growing up?,Have you always beenncomfortable with your body? 
 SW: It's interesting, becausenwhen you're a teenage female,growing up in the public eye,,it is a lot of scrutiny that you face,,and as any female that's a teenager,,I definitely was notncomfortable in my body.,I didn't like it.,I didn't understand why I had muscles.,And I stopped lifting weights.,I was like, I'm not going to do this.,But then after I won the US Open,,I realized that my body helped menreach goals that I wanted to reach,,and I wanted to be happy with it,,and I was so appreciative of it.,I'm always healthy.,I'm really fortunate and superblessed,,and I felt like not onlynam I happy with my body,,but I want other peoplenand other young girls,that have experiencednwhat I've experienced,to be happy with themselves.,So whatever people say --,masculine, whatever,ntoo much, too little --,I'm OK with it as long as I love myself. 
 (Applause) 
 GK: I know you learn a lot from winning,,but what have you learned from losing? 
 SW: I hate to lose, but I thinknlosing has brought me here today.,The only reason I am who I amnis because of my losses,,and some of them are extremely painful,,but I wouldn't take any of them away,,because every time I lose,,it takes a really long timenfor me to lose again,because I learn so much from it.,And I encourage everyone that I talk to --,I'm like, listen, if you losenor if something happens --,not in sports --nin business or in school --,learn from it.,Don't live in the past,nlive in the present,,and don't make the samenmistakes in the future.,That's somethingnthat I always try to live by. 
 GK: Now you're planning a wedding,and I want to know,nis it a destination wedding,in the Catskills or Poconosnor are you going to do it in Florida?,What are you thinking?,Big or small? 
 SW: We're thinking medium size.nWe don't want to do too big,,but then we're like, OK, we can'tnsay no to this person, this person.,So we're thinking medium sizenand we're just thinking --,My personality is a lot of fun.nHopefully you can see that today.,I'm not too serious. 
 GK: And you like to dance.,And the next chapternfor Serena Williams is what? 
 SW: Oh, next for me.,Obviously I'm going to have a baby,and I'm going to stay fitnand kind of come back and play tennis,and keep working on my fashion line.,That'll be really fun. 
 GK: Do you know if it's a boy or girl? 
 SW: I don't. I have a feelingnof one or the other.,It's a 50-50 chance, but I have a feeling. 
 GK: Gayle is a unisex name.,Whatever you and Alexis decide,nwe are cheering you on! 
 SW: Thank you for that.nGK: You're welcome.,We are cheering you on, Serena Williams.nSW: Thank you so much. 
 Thank you guys. 
 (Applause)Namaskar. 
 I'm a movie star, I'm 51 years of age,,and I don't use Botox as yet. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I'm clean, but I do behave like you sawnlike a 21-year-old in my movies.,Yeah, I do that.,I sell dreams, and I peddle lovento millions of people back home in India,who assume that I'mnthe best lover in the world. 
 (Laughter) 
 If you don't tell anyone,nI'm going to tell you I'm not,,but I never let that assumption go away. 
 (Laughter) 
 I've also been made to understand,there are lots of you herenwho haven't seen my work,,and I feel really sad for you. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 That doesn't take away from the factnthat I'm completely self-obsessed,,as a movie star should be. 
 (Laughter) 
 That's when my friends,nChris and Juliet called me here,to speak about the future "you.",Naturally, it follows I'm goingnto speak about the present me. 
 (Laughter) 
 Because I truly believenthat humanity is a lot like me. 
 (Laughter) 
 It is. It is.,It's an aging movie star,,grappling with allnthe newness around itself,,wondering whethernit got it right in the first place,,and still trying to find a way,to keep on shining regardless. 
 I was born in a refugee colonynin the capital city of India, New Delhi.,And my father was a freedom fighter.,My mother was, well,njust a fighter like mothers are.,And much like the original homo sapiens,,we struggled to survive.,When I was in my early 20s,,I lost both my parents,,which I must admitnseems a bit careless of me now,,but -- 
 (Laughter) 
 I do remember the night my father died,,and I remember the driver of a neighbornwho was driving us to the hospital.,He mumbled somethingnabout "dead people don't tip so well",and walked away into the dark.,And I was only 14 then,,and I put my father's dead bodynin the back seat of the car,,and my mother besides me,,I started driving backnfrom the hospital to the house.,And in the middle of her quiet crying,nmy mother looked at me and she said,,"Son, when did you learn to drive?",And I thought about itnand realized, and I said to my mom,,"Just now, Mom." 
 (Laughter) 
 So from that night onwards,,much akin to humanity in its adolescence,,I learned the crude tools of survival.,And the framework of life wasnvery, very simple then, to be honest.,You know, you just ate what you got,and did whatever you were told to do.,I thought celiac was a vegetable,,and vegan, of course, was Mr. Spock'snlost comrade in "Star Trek." 
 (Laughter) 
 You married the first girl that you dated,,and you were a techie if you could fixnthe carburetor in your car.,I really thought that gay wasna sophisticated English word for happy.,And Lesbian, of course, was the capitalnof Portugal, as you all know. 
 (Laughter) 
 Where was I?,We relied on systems,created through the toil and sacrificenof generations before,to protect us,,and we felt that governmentsnactually worked for our betterment.,Science was simple and logical,,Apple was still then just a fruit,owned by Eve first and then Newton,,not by Steve Jobs, until then.,And "Eureka!" was what you screamed,when you wantednto run naked on the streets.,You went wherever life took you for work,,and people were mostly welcoming of you.,Migration was a term then,still reserved for Siberian cranes,nnot human beings.,Most importantly, you were who you were,and you said what you thought. 
 Then in my late 20s,,I shifted to the sprawlingnmetropolis of Mumbai,,and my framework,,like the newly industrializednaspirational humanity,,began to alter.,In the urban rush for a new,nmore embellished survival,,things started to look a little different.,I met people who had descendednfrom all over the world,,faces, races, genders, money-lenders.,Definitions became more and more fluid.,Work began to define you at that time,in an overwhelmingly equalizing manner,,and all the systemsnstarted to feel less reliable to me,,almost too thick to hold on,to the diversity of mankind,and the human need to progress and grow.,Ideas were flowingnwith more freedom and speed.,And I experienced the miraclenof human innovation and cooperation,,and my own creativity,,when supported by the resourcefulnessnof this collective endeavor,,catapulted me into superstardom. 
 I started to feel that I had arrived,,and generally, by the time I was 40,nI was really, really flying.,I was all over the place.,You know? I'd done 50 films by then,and 200 songs,,and I'd been knighted by the Malaysians.,I had been given the highest civil honornby the French government,,the title of which for the life of menI can't pronounce even until now. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm sorry, France, and thank you,nFrance, for doing that.,But much bigger than that,nI got to meet Angelina Jolie -- 
 (Laughter) 
 for two and a half seconds. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I'm sure she also remembersnthat encounter somewhere.,OK, maybe not.,And I sat next to Hannah Montananon a round dinner table,with her back towards me most of the time.,Like I said, I was flying,nfrom Miley to Jolie,,and humanity was soaring with me.,We were both pretty muchnflying off the handle, actually. 
 And then you all know what happened.,The internet happened.,I was in my late 40s,,and I started tweetingnlike a canary in a birdcage,and assuming that, you know,npeople who peered into my world,would admire it,for the miracle I believed it to be.,But something elsenawaited me and humanity.,You know, we had expectednan expansion of ideas and dreams,with the enhancednconnectivity of the world.,We had not bargainednfor the village-like enclosure of thought,,of judgment, of definition,that flowed from the same place,that freedom and revolutionnwas taking place in.,Everything I said took a new meaning.,Everything I did -- good, bad, ugly --,was there for the worldnto comment upon and judge.,As a matter of fact,neverything I didn't say or do also,met with the same fate. 
 Four years ago,,my lovely wife Gauri and mendecided to have a third child.,It was claimed on the net,that he was the love child,of our first child,who was 15 years old.,Apparently, he had sownnhis wild oats with a girl,while driving her car in Romania.,And yeah, there wasna fake video to go with it.,And we were so disturbed as a family.,My son, who is 19 now,,even now when you say "hello" to him,,he just turns around and says,,"But bro, I didn't even havena European driving license." 
 (Laughter) 
 Yeah.,In this new world,,slowly, reality became virtualnand virtual became real,,and I started to feel,that I could not be who I wanted to benor say what I actually thought,,and humanity at this time,completely identified with me.,I think both of usnwere going through our midlife crisis,,and humanity, like me,nwas becoming an overexposed prima donna.,I started to sell everything,,from hair oil to diesel generators.,Humanity was buying everything,from crude oil to nuclear reactors.,You know, I even triednto get into a skintight superhero suit,to reinvent myself.,I must admit I failed miserably.,And just an aside I want to saynon behalf of all the Batmen, Spider-Men,and Supermen of the world,,you have to commend them,,because it really hurts in the crotch,nthat superhero suit. 
 (Laughter) 
 Yeah, I'm being honest.nI need to tell you this here.,Really.,And accidentally, I happenednto even invent a new dance form,which I didn't realize,nand it became a rage.,So if it's all right,,and you've seen a bit of me,nso I'm quite shameless, I'll show you.,It was called the Lungi dance.,So if it's all right, I'll just show you.nI'm talented otherwise. 
 (Cheers) 
 So it went something like this. 
 Lungi dance. Lungi dance.nLungi dance. Lungi dance.,Lungi dance. Lungi dance.nLungi dance. Lungi dance.,Lungi dance. Lungi dance.nLungi dance. Lungi. 
 That's it. It became a rage. 
 (Cheers) 
 It really did.,Like you notice, nobody could makenany sense of what was happening except me,,and I didn't give a damn, really,,because the whole world,nand whole humanity,,seemed as confused and lost as I was.,I didn't give up then.,I even tried to reconstructnmy identity on the social media,like everyone else does.,I thought if I put onnphilosophical tweets out there,people will think I'm with it,,but some of the responses I gotnfrom those tweets,were extremely confusing acronymsnwhich I didn't understand. You know?,ROFL, LOL.,"Adidas," somebody wrote backnto one of my more thought-provoking tweets,and I was wonderingnwhy would you name a sneaker,,I mean, why would you write backnthe name of a sneaker to me?,And I asked my 16-year-old daughter,nand she enlightened me.,"Adidas" now meansn"All day I dream about sex." 
 (Laughter) 
 Really.,I didn't know if you know that.,So I wrote back,n"WTF" in bold to Mr. Adidas,,thanking secretly that some acronymsnand things won't change at all.,WTF. 
 But here we are.,I am 51 years old, like I told you,,and mind-numbing acronyms notwithstanding,,I just want to tell you,if there has been a momentous timenfor humanity to exist,,it is now,,because the present you is brave.,The present you is hopeful.,The present younis innovative and resourceful,,and of course, the present younis annoyingly indefinable.,And in this spell-binding,,imperfect moment of existence,,feeling a little bravenjust before I came here,,I decided to takena good, hard look at my face.,And I realized that I'm beginningnto look more and more,like the wax statue of menat Madame Tussaud's. 
 (Laughter) 
 Yeah, and in that moment of realization,,I asked the most centralnand pertinent question to humanity and me:,Do I need to fix my face?,Really. I'm an actor, like I told you,,a modern expression of human creativity.,The land I come from,is the source of inexplicablenbut very simple spirituality.,In its immense generosity,,India decided somehow,that I, the Muslim sonnof a broke freedom fighter,who accidentally venturedninto the business of selling dreams,,should become its king of romance,,the "Badhshah of Bollywood,",the greatest lovernthe country has ever seen ...,with this face.,Yeah. 
 (Laughter) 
 Which has alternatelynbeen described as ugly, unconventional,,and strangely, not chocolatey enough. 
 (Laughter) 
 The people of this ancient land,embraced me in their limitless love,,and I've learned from these people,that neither power nor poverty,can make your life more magical,or less tortuous.,I've learned from the people of my country,that the dignity of a life,,a human being, a culture,na religion, a country,actually resides in its ability,for grace and compassion.,I've learned that whatever moves you,,whatever urges you to create, to build,,whatever keeps you from failing,,whatever helps you survive,,is perhaps the oldest and the simplestnemotion known to mankind,,and that is love.,A mystic poet from my land famously wrote, 
 (Recites poem in Hindi) 
 (Poem ends) 
 Which loosely translatesninto that whatever --,yeah, if you know Hindi,nplease clap, yeah. 
 (Applause) 
 It's very difficult to remember.,Which loosely translatesninto actually saying,that all the books of knowledgenthat you might read,and then go aheadnand impart your knowledge,through innovation,nthrough creativity, through technology,,but mankind will never benthe wiser about its future,unless it is coupled with a sense of lovenand compassion for their fellow beings.,The two and a half alphabetsnwhich form the word "प्रेम,",which means "love,",if you are able to understand that,and practice it,,that itself is enoughnto enlighten mankind.,So I truly believe the future "you",has to be a you that loves.,Otherwise it will cease to flourish.,It will perish in its own self-absorption. 
 So you may use your power,to build walls,and keep people outside,,or you may use it to break barriersnand welcome them in.,You may use your faith,to make people afraid,and terrify them into submission,,or you can use itnto give courage to people,so they rise to the greatestnheights of enlightenment.,You can use your energy,to build nuclear bombsnand spread the darkness of destruction,,or you can use it to spreadnthe joy of light to millions.,You may filthy up the oceans callouslynand cut down all the forests.,You can destroy the ecology,,or turn to them with love,and regenerate lifenfrom the waters and trees.,You may land on Mars,and build armed citadels,,or you may look for life-forms and speciesnto learn from and respect.,And you can usenall the moneys we all have earned,to wage futile wars,and give guns in the handsnof little children,to kill each other with,,or you can use it,to make more food,to fill their stomachs with. 
 My country has taught me,the capacity for a human being to lovenis akin to godliness.,It shines forth in a world,which civilization, I think,nalready has tampered too much with.,In the last few days,nthe talks here, the wonderful people,coming and showing their talent,,talking about individual achievements,nthe innovation, the technology,,the sciences, the knowledgenwe are gaining by being here,in the presence of TED Talksnand all of you,are reasons enoughnfor us to celebrate the future "us.",But within that celebration,the quest to cultivatenour capacity for love and compassion,has to assert itself,nhas to assert itself,,just as equally. 
 So I believe the future "you",is an infinite you.,It's called a chakranin India, like a circle.,It ends where it begins fromnto complete itself.,A you that perceivesntime and space differently,understands both,your unimaginable,and fantastic importance,and your complete unimportancenin the larger context of the universe.,A you that returns back,to the original innocence of humanity,,which loves from the purity of heart,,which sees from the eyes of truth,,which dreams from the claritynof an untampered mind. 
 The future "you" has to be,like an aging movie star,who has been made to believenthat there is a possibility,of a world which is completely,,wholly, self-obsessively,in love with itself.,A world -- really, it has to be a you,to create a world,which is its own best lover.,That I believe, ladies and gentlemen,,should be the future "you." 
 Thank you very much.,Shukriya. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)This is Lee Sedol.,Lee Sedol is one of the world'sngreatest Go players,,and he's having what my friendsnin Silicon Valley call,a "Holy Cow" moment -- 
 (Laughter) 
 a moment where we realize,that AI is actually progressingna lot faster than we expected.,So humans have lost on the Go board.nWhat about the real world? 
 Well, the real world is much bigger,,much more complicated than the Go board.,It's a lot less visible,,but it's still a decision problem.,And if we think about somenof the technologies,that are coming down the pike ...,Noriko [Arai] mentioned that readingnis not yet happening in machines,,at least with understanding.,But that will happen,,and when that happens,,very soon afterwards,,machines will have read everythingnthat the human race has ever written.,And that will enable machines,,along with the ability to looknfurther ahead than humans can,,as we've already seen in Go,,if they also have accessnto more information,,they'll be able to make better decisionsnin the real world than we can.,So is that a good thing?,Well, I hope so. 
 Our entire civilization,neverything that we value,,is based on our intelligence.,And if we had accessnto a lot more intelligence,,then there's really no limitnto what the human race can do.,And I think this could be,nas some people have described it,,the biggest event in human history.,So why are people saying things like this,,that AI might spell the endnof the human race?,Is this a new thing?,Is it just Elon Musk and Bill Gatesnand Stephen Hawking? 
 Actually, no. This ideanhas been around for a while.,Here's a quotation:,"Even if we could keep the machinesnin a subservient position,,for instance, by turning off the powernat strategic moments" --,and I'll come back to thatn"turning off the power" idea later on --,"we should, as a species,nfeel greatly humbled.",So who said this?nThis is Alan Turing in 1951.,Alan Turing, as you know,nis the father of computer science,and in many ways,nthe father of AI as well.,So if we think about this problem,,the problem of creating somethingnmore intelligent than your own species,,we might call this "the gorilla problem,",because gorillas' ancestors did thisna few million years ago,,and now we can ask the gorillas:,Was this a good idea? 
 So here they are having a meetingnto discuss whether it was a good idea,,and after a little while,nthey conclude, no,,this was a terrible idea.,Our species is in dire straits.,In fact, you can see the existentialnsadness in their eyes. 
 (Laughter) 
 So this queasy feeling that makingnsomething smarter than your own species,is maybe not a good idea --,what can we do about that?,Well, really nothing,nexcept stop doing AI,,and because of allnthe benefits that I mentioned,and because I'm an AI researcher,,I'm not having that.,I actually want to be ablento keep doing AI. 
 So we actually need to nail downnthe problem a bit more.,What exactly is the problem?,Why is better AI possibly a catastrophe? 
 So here's another quotation:,"We had better be quite surenthat the purpose put into the machine,is the purpose which we really desire.",This was said by Norbert Wiener in 1960,,shortly after he watchednone of the very early learning systems,learn to play checkersnbetter than its creator.,But this could equally have been said,by King Midas.,King Midas said, "I want everythingnI touch to turn to gold,",and he got exactly what he asked for.,That was the purposenthat he put into the machine,,so to speak,,and then his food and his drinknand his relatives turned to gold,and he died in misery and starvation.,So we'll call thisn"the King Midas problem",of stating an objectivenwhich is not, in fact,,truly aligned with what we want.,In modern terms, we call thisn"the value alignment problem." 
 Putting in the wrong objectivenis not the only part of the problem.,There's another part.,If you put an objective into a machine,,even something as simple as,n"Fetch the coffee,",the machine says to itself,,"Well, how might I failnto fetch the coffee?,Someone might switch me off.,OK, I have to take steps to prevent that.,I will disable my 'off' switch.,I will do anything to defend myselfnagainst interference,with this objectiventhat I have been given.",So this single-minded pursuit,in a very defensive modenof an objective that is, in fact,,not aligned with the true objectivesnof the human race --,that's the problem that we face.,And in fact, that's the high-valuentakeaway from this talk.,If you want to remember one thing,,it's that you can't fetchnthe coffee if you're dead. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's very simple. Just remember that.nRepeat it to yourself three times a day. 
 (Laughter) 
 And in fact, this is exactly the plot,of "2001: [A Space Odyssey]",HAL has an objective, a mission,,which is not alignednwith the objectives of the humans,,and that leads to this conflict.,Now fortunately, HALnis not superintelligent.,He's pretty smart,nbut eventually Dave outwits him,and manages to switch him off.,But we might not be so lucky.,So what are we going to do? 
 I'm trying to redefine AI,to get away from this classical notion,of machines that intelligentlynpursue objectives.,There are three principles involved.,The first one is a principlenof altruism, if you like,,that the robot's only objective,is to maximize the realizationnof human objectives,,of human values.,And by values here I don't meanntouchy-feely, goody-goody values.,I just mean whatever it isnthat the human would prefer,their life to be like.,And so this actually violates Asimov's law,that the robot has to protectnits own existence.,It has no interest in preservingnits existence whatsoever. 
 The second law is a lawnof humility, if you like.,And this turns out to be reallynimportant to make robots safe.,It says that the robot does not know,what those human values are,,so it has to maximize them,nbut it doesn't know what they are.,And that avoids this problemnof single-minded pursuit,of an objective.,This uncertainty turns out to be crucial. 
 Now, in order to be useful to us,,it has to have some idea of what we want.,It obtains that information primarilynby observation of human choices,,so our own choices reveal information,about what it is that we prefernour lives to be like.,So those are the three principles.,Let's see how that appliesnto this question of:,"Can you switch the machine off?"nas Turing suggested. 
 So here's a PR2 robot.,This is one that we have in our lab,,and it has a big red "off" switchnright on the back.,The question is: Is itngoing to let you switch it off?,If we do it the classical way,,we give it the objective of, "Fetchnthe coffee, I must fetch the coffee,,I can't fetch the coffee if I'm dead,",so obviously the PR2nhas been listening to my talk,,and so it says, therefore,n"I must disable my 'off' switch,,and probably taser all the othernpeople in Starbucks,who might interfere with me." 
 (Laughter) 
 So this seems to be inevitable, right?,This kind of failure modenseems to be inevitable,,and it follows from havingna concrete, definite objective. 
 So what happens if the machinenis uncertain about the objective?,Well, it reasons in a different way.,It says, "OK, the humannmight switch me off,,but only if I'm doing something wrong.,Well, I don't really know what wrong is,,but I know that I don't want to do it.",So that's the first and secondnprinciples right there.,"So I should let the human switch me off.",And in fact you can calculatenthe incentive that the robot has,to allow the human to switch it off,,and it's directly tied to the degree,of uncertainty aboutnthe underlying objective. 
 And then when the machine is switched off,,that third principle comes into play.,It learns something about the objectivesnit should be pursuing,,because it learns thatnwhat it did wasn't right.,In fact, we can, with suitable usenof Greek symbols,,as mathematicians usually do,,we can actually prove a theorem,that says that such a robotnis provably beneficial to the human.,You are provably better offnwith a machine that's designed in this way,than without it.,So this is a very simple example,nbut this is the first step,in what we're trying to donwith human-compatible AI. 
 Now, this third principle,,I think is the one that you're probablynscratching your head over.,You're probably thinking, "Well,nyou know, I behave badly.,I don't want my robot to behave like me.,I sneak down in the middle of the nightnand take stuff from the fridge.,I do this and that.",There's all kinds of thingsnyou don't want the robot doing.,But in fact, it doesn'tnquite work that way.,Just because you behave badly,doesn't mean the robotnis going to copy your behavior.,It's going to understand your motivationsnand maybe help you resist them,,if appropriate.,But it's still difficult.,What we're trying to do, in fact,,is to allow machines to predictnfor any person and for any possible life,that they could live,,and the lives of everybody else:,Which would they prefer?,And there are many, manyndifficulties involved in doing this;,I don't expect that thisnis going to get solved very quickly.,The real difficulties, in fact, are us. 
 As I have already mentioned,nwe behave badly.,In fact, some of us are downright nasty.,Now the robot, as I said,ndoesn't have to copy the behavior.,The robot does not havenany objective of its own.,It's purely altruistic.,And it's not designed just to satisfynthe desires of one person, the user,,but in fact it has to respectnthe preferences of everybody.,So it can deal with a certainnamount of nastiness,,and it can even understandnthat your nastiness, for example,,you may take bribes as a passport official,because you need to feed your familynand send your kids to school.,It can understand that;nit doesn't mean it's going to steal.,In fact, it'll just help younsend your kids to school. 
 We are also computationally limited.,Lee Sedol is a brilliant Go player,,but he still lost.,So if we look at his actions,nhe took an action that lost the game.,That doesn't mean he wanted to lose.,So to understand his behavior,,we actually have to invertnthrough a model of human cognition,that includes our computationalnlimitations -- a very complicated model.,But it's still somethingnthat we can work on understanding. 
 Probably the most difficult part,nfrom my point of view as an AI researcher,,is the fact that there are lots of us,,and so the machine has to somehowntrade off, weigh up the preferences,of many different people,,and there are different ways to do that.,Economists, sociologists,nmoral philosophers have understood that,,and we are activelynlooking for collaboration. 
 Let's have a look and see what happensnwhen you get that wrong.,So you can havena conversation, for example,,with your intelligent personal assistant,that might be availablenin a few years' time.,Think of a Siri on steroids.,So Siri says, "Your wife callednto remind you about dinner tonight.",And of course, you've forgotten.n"What? What dinner?,What are you talking about?" 
 "Uh, your 20th anniversary at 7pm." 
 "I can't do that. I'm meetingnwith the secretary-general at 7:30.,How could this have happened?" 
 "Well, I did warn you, but you overrodenmy recommendation." 
 "Well, what am I going to do?nI can't just tell him I'm too busy." 
 "Don't worry. I arrangednfor his plane to be delayed." 
 (Laughter) 
 "Some kind of computer malfunction." 
 (Laughter) 
 "Really? You can do that?" 
 "He sends his profound apologies,and looks forward to meeting younfor lunch tomorrow." 
 (Laughter) 
 So the values here --nthere's a slight mistake going on.,This is clearly following my wife's values,which is "Happy wife, happy life." 
 (Laughter) 
 It could go the other way.,You could come homenafter a hard day's work,,and the computer says, "Long day?" 
 "Yes, I didn't even have time for lunch." 
 "You must be very hungry." 
 "Starving, yeah.nCould you make some dinner?" 
 "There's something I need to tell you." 
 (Laughter) 
 "There are humans in South Sudannwho are in more urgent need than you." 
 (Laughter) 
 "So I'm leaving. Make your own dinner." 
 (Laughter) 
 So we have to solve these problems,,and I'm looking forwardnto working on them. 
 There are reasons for optimism.,One reason is,,there is a massive amount of data.,Because remember -- I saidnthey're going to read everything,the human race has ever written.,Most of what we write aboutnis human beings doing things,and other people getting upset about it.,So there's a massive amountnof data to learn from. 
 There's also a verynstrong economic incentive,to get this right.,So imagine your domestic robot's at home.,You're late from work againnand the robot has to feed the kids,,and the kids are hungrynand there's nothing in the fridge.,And the robot sees the cat. 
 (Laughter) 
 And the robot hasn't quite learnednthe human value function properly,,so it doesn't understand,the sentimental value of the cat outweighsnthe nutritional value of the cat. 
 (Laughter) 
 So then what happens?,Well, it happens like this:,"Deranged robot cooks kittynfor family dinner.",That one incident would be the endnof the domestic robot industry.,So there's a huge incentivento get this right,long before we reachnsuperintelligent machines. 
 So to summarize:,I'm actually trying to changenthe definition of AI,so that we have provablynbeneficial machines.,And the principles are:,machines that are altruistic,,that want to achieve only our objectives,,but that are uncertainnabout what those objectives are,,and will watch all of us,to learn more about what it isnthat we really want.,And hopefully in the process,nwe will learn to be better people.,Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: So interesting, Stuart.,We're going to stand here a bitnbecause I think they're setting up,for our next speaker. 
 A couple of questions.,So the idea of programming in ignorancenseems intuitively really powerful.,As you get to superintelligence,,what's going to stop a robot,reading literature and discoveringnthis idea that knowledge,is actually better than ignorance,and still just shifting its own goalsnand rewriting that programming? 
 Stuart Russell: Yes, so we wantnit to learn more, as I said,,about our objectives.,It'll only become more certainnas it becomes more correct,,so the evidence is there,and it's going to be designednto interpret it correctly.,It will understand, for example,nthat books are very biased,in the evidence they contain.,They only talk about kings and princes,and elite white male people doing stuff.,So it's a complicated problem,,but as it learns more about our objectives,it will become more and more useful to us. 
 CA: And you couldn'tnjust boil it down to one law,,you know, hardwired in:,"if any human ever tries to switch me off,,I comply. I comply." 
 SR: Absolutely not.,That would be a terrible idea.,So imagine that you havena self-driving car,and you want to send your five-year-old,off to preschool.,Do you want your five-year-oldnto be able to switch off the car,while it's driving along?,Probably not.,So it needs to understand how rationalnand sensible the person is.,The more rational the person,,the more willing you arento be switched off.,If the person is completelynrandom or even malicious,,then you're less willingnto be switched off. 
 CA: All right. Stuart, can I just say,,I really, really hope younfigure this out for us.,Thank you so much for that talk.nThat was amazing. 
 SR: Thank you. 
 (Applause)Here's an intriguing fact.,In the developed world,,everywhere, women live an averagenof six to eight years longer than men do.,Six to eight years longer.,That's, like, a huge gap.,In 2015, the "Lancet" published an article,showing that men in rich countries,are twice as likely to die as women are,at any age. 
 But there is one place in the world,where men live as long as women.,It's a remote, mountainous zone,,a blue zone,,where super longevity,is common to both sexes.,This is the blue zone in Sardinia,,an Italian island in the Mediterranean,,between Corsica and Tunisia,,where there are six timesnas many centenarians,as on the Italian mainland,,less than 200 miles away.,There are 10 times as many centenarians,as there are in North America.,It's the only placenwhere men live as long as women. 
 But why?,My curiosity was piqued.,I decided to research the sciencenand the habits of the place,,and I started with the genetic profile.,I discovered soon enough,that genes account for justn25 percent of their longevity.,The other 75 percent is lifestyle. 
 So what does it takento live to 100 or beyond?,What are they doing right?,What you're looking atnis an aerial view of Villagrande.,It's a village at the epicenternof the blue zone,where I went to investigate this,,and as you can see, architectural beautynis not its main virtue,,density is:,tightly spaced houses,,interwoven alleys and streets.,It means that the villagers' livesnconstantly intersect.,And as I walked through the village,,I could feel hundredsnof pairs of eyes watching me,from behind doorways and curtains,,from behind shutters.,Because like all ancient villages,,Villagrande couldn't have survived,without this structure,nwithout its walls, without its cathedral,,without its village square,,because defense and social cohesionndefined its design. 
 Urban priorities changed as we movedntowards the industrial revolution,because infectious diseasenbecame the risk of the day.,But what about now?,Now, social isolationnis the public health risk of our time.,Now, a third of the population says,they have two or fewer people to lean on. 
 But let's go to Villagrandennow as a contrast,to meet some centenarians. 
 Meet Giuseppe Murinu.nHe's 102, a supercentenarian,and a lifelong residentnof the village of Villagrande.,He was a gregarious man.,He loved to recount stories,such as how he lived like a bird,from what he could findnon the forest floor,during not one but two world wars,,how he and his wife,nwho also lived past 100,,raised six childrennin a small, homey kitchen,where I interviewed him.,Here he is with his sonsnAngelo and Domenico,,both in their 70snand looking after their father,,and who were quite franklynvery suspicious of me and my daughter,who came along with menon this research trip,,because the flip side of social cohesion,is a wariness of strangers and outsiders.,But Giuseppe, he wasn't suspicious at all.,He was a happy-go-lucky guy,,very outgoing with a positive outlook.,And I wondered: so is that what it takesnto live to be 100 or beyond,,thinking positively?,Actually, no. 
 (Laughter) 
 Meet Giovanni Corrias. He's 101,,the grumpiest person I have ever met. 
 (Laughter) 
 And he put a lie to the notion,that you have to be positivento live a long life.,And there is evidence for this.,When I asked him why he lived so long,,he kind of looked at menunder hooded eyelids and he growled,,"Nobody has to know my secrets." 
 (Laughter) 
 But despite being a sourpuss,,the niece who lived with himnand looked after him,called him "Il Tesoro," "my treasure.",And she respected him and loved him,,and she told me, when I questionednthis obvious loss of her freedom,,"You just don't understand, do you?,Looking after this man is a pleasure.,It's a huge privilege for me.,This is my heritage.",And indeed, wherever I wentnto interview these centenarians,,I found a kitchen party.,Here's Giovanni with his two nieces,,Maria above him,and beside him his great-niece Sara,,who came when I was therento bring fresh fruits and vegetables.,And I quickly discovered by being there,that in the blue zone, as people age,,and indeed across their lifespans,,they're always surroundednby extended family, by friends,,by neighbors, the priest,nthe barkeeper, the grocer.,People are always there or dropping by.,They are never leftnto live solitary lives.,This is unlike the restnof the developed world,,where as George Burns quipped,,"Happiness is having a large,nloving, caring family in another city." 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, so far we've only met men,,long-living men, but I met women too,,and here you see Zia Teresa.,She, at over 100, taught menhow to make the local specialty,,which is called culurgiones,,which are these large pasta pockets,like ravioli about this size,,this size,,and they're fillednwith high-fat ricotta and mint,and drenched in tomato sauce.,And she showed menhow to make just the right crimp,so they wouldn't open,,and she makes themnwith her daughters every Sunday,and distributes themnby the dozens to neighbors and friends.,And that's when I discoveredna low-fat, gluten-free diet,is not what it takesnto live to 100 in the blue zone. 
 (Applause) 
 Now, these centenarians' storiesnalong with the science that underpins them,prompted me to ask myselfnsome questions too,,such as, when am I going to dienand how can I put that day off?,And as you will see,nthe answer is not what we expect.,Julianne Holt-Lunstad is a researchernat Brigham Young University,and she addressed this very question,in a series of studies,of tens of thousands of middle aged people,much like this audience here.,And she looked at everynaspect of their lifestyle:,their diet, their exercise,,their marital status,,how often they went to the doctor,,whether they smoked or drank, etc.,She recorded all of this,and then she and her colleaguesnsat tight and waited for seven years,to see who would still be breathing.,And of the people left standing,,what reduced their chancesnof dying the most?,That was her question. 
 So let's now look at her data in summary,,going from the least powerfulnpredictor to the strongest.,OK?,So clean air, which is great,,it doesn't predict how long you will live.,Whether you have your hypertension treated,is good.,Still not a strong predictor.,Whether you're lean or overweight,nyou can stop feeling guilty about this,,because it's only in third place.,How much exercise you get is next,,still only a moderate predictor.,Whether you've had a cardiac eventnand you're in rehab and exercising,,getting higher now.,Whether you've had a flu vaccine.,Did anybody here know,that having a flu vaccinenprotects you more than doing exercise?,Whether you were drinking and quit,,or whether you're a moderate drinker,,whether you don't smoke,nor if you did, whether you quit,,and getting towards the top predictors,are two features of your social life.,First, your close relationships.,These are the peoplenthat you can call on for a loan,if you need money suddenly,,who will call the doctornif you're not feeling well,or who will take you to the hospital,,or who will sit with younif you're having an existential crisis,,if you're in despair.,Those people, that little clutch of people,are a strong predictor, if you have them,nof how long you'll live.,And then something that surprised me,,something that's callednsocial integration.,This means how muchnyou interact with people,as you move through your day.,How many people do you talk to?,And these mean bothnyour weak and your strong bonds,,so not just the peoplenyou're really close to,,who mean a lot to you,,but, like, do you talk to the guynwho every day makes you your coffee?,Do you talk to the postman?,Do you talk to the woman who walksnby your house every day with her dog?,Do you play bridge or poker,nhave a book club?,Those interactionsnare one of the strongest predictors,of how long you'll live. 
 Now, this leads me to the next question:,if we now spend more time onlinenthan on any other activity,,including sleeping,,we're now up to 11 hours a day,,one hour more than last year, by the way,,does it make a difference?,Why distinguishnbetween interacting in person,and interacting via social media?,Is it the same thing as being there,if you're in contact constantlynwith your kids through text, for example?,Well, the short answernto the question is no,,it's not the same thing.,Face-to-face contact releasesna whole cascade of neurotransmitters,,and like a vaccine,nthey protect you now in the present,and well into the future.,So simply makingneye contact with somebody,,shaking hands, giving somebody a high-five,is enough to release oxytocin,,which increases your level of trust,and it lowers your cortisol levels.,So it lowers your stress.,And dopamine is generated,nwhich gives us a little high,and it kills pain.,It's like a naturally produced morphine. 
 Now, all of this passesnunder our conscious radar,,which is why we conflatenonline activity with the real thing.,But we do have evidence now,nfresh evidence,,that there is a difference.,So let's look at some of the neuroscience.,Elizabeth Redcay, a neuroscientistnat the University of Maryland,,tried to map the difference,between what goes on in our brainsnwhen we interact in person,versus when we're watchingnsomething that's static.,And what she did wasnshe compared the brain function,of two groups of people,,those interacting live with her,or with one of her research associates,in a dynamic conversation,,and she compared thatnto the brain activity of people,who were watching her talknabout the same subject,but in a canned video, like on YouTube.,And by the way, if you want to know,how she fit two peoplenin an MRI scanner at the same time,,talk to me later. 
 So what's the difference?,This is your brainnon real social interaction.,What you're seeingnis the difference in brain activity,between interacting in personnand taking in static content.,In orange, you see the brain areasnthat are associated with attention,,social intelligence --,that means anticipatingnwhat somebody else is thinking,and feeling and planning --,and emotional reward.,And these areas become much more engaged,when we're interactingnwith a live partner. 
 Now, these richer brain signatures,might be why recruitersnfrom Fortune 500 companies,evaluating candidates,thought that the candidates were smarter,when they heard their voices,compared to when they justnread their pitches in a text, for example,,or an email or a letter.,Now, our voices and body languagenconvey a rich signal.,It shows that we're thinking, feeling,,sentient human beings,who are much more than an algorithm.,Now, this research by Nicholas Epley,at the University of ChicagonBusiness School,is quite amazing becausenit tells us a simple thing.,If somebody hears your voice,,they think you're smarter.,I mean, that's quite a simple thing. 
 Now, to return to the beginning,,why do women live longer than men?,And one major reasonnis that women are more likely,to prioritize and groomntheir face-to-face relationships,over their lifespans.,Fresh evidence shows,that these in-person friendships,create a biological force fieldnagainst disease and decline.,And it's not just true of humans,but their primate relations,nour primate relations as well.,Anthropologist Joan Silk's worknshows that female baboons,who have a core of female friends,show lower levels of stressnvia their cortisol levels,,they live longer and they havenmore surviving offspring.,At least three stable relationships.,That was the magic number.,Think about it.,I hope you guys have three. 
 The power of such face-to-face contact,is really why there arenthe lowest rates of dementia,among people who are socially engaged.,It's why women who have breast cancer,are four times more likelynto survive their disease than loners are.,Why men who've had a strokenwho meet regularly to play poker,or to have coffee,or to play old-timer's hockey --,I'm Canadian, after all -- 
 (Laughter) 
 are better protectednby that social contact,than they are by medication.,Why men who've had a strokenwho meet regularly --,this is something verynpowerful they can do.,This face-to-face contactnprovides stunning benefits,,yet now almost a quarter of the populationnsays they have no one to talk to. 
 We can do something about this.,Like Sardinian villagers,,it's a biological imperativento know we belong,,and not just the women among us.,Building in-person interactionninto our cities, into our workplaces,,into our agendas,bolsters the immune system,,sends feel-good hormonesnsurging through the bloodstream and brain,and helps us live longer.,I call this building your village,,and building it and sustaining itnis a matter of life and death.,Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Helen Walters: Susan, come back.nI have a question for you.,I'm wondering if there's a middle path.,So you talk about the neurotransmittersnconnecting when in face-to-face,,but what about digital technology?,We've seen enormous improvementsnin digital technology,like FaceTime, things like that.,Does that work too?,I mean, I see my nephew.,He plays Minecraftnand he's yelling at his friends.,It seems like he's connecting pretty well.,Is that useful? Is that helpful? 
 Susan Pinker: Some of the datanare just emerging.,The data are so freshnthat the digital revolution happened,and the health data trailed behind.,So we're just learning,,but I would saynthere are some improvements,that we could make in the technology.,For example, the camera on your laptopnis at the top of the screen,,so for example, when you'renlooking into the screen,,you're not actually making eye contact.,So something as simplenas even just looking into the camera,can increase those neurotransmitters,,or maybe changingnthe position of the camera.,So it's not identical, but I thinknwe are getting closer with the technology. 
 HW: Great. Thank you so much. 
 SP: Thank you. 
 (Applause)Vanessa Garrison: I am Vanessa,,daughter of Annette,,daughter of Olympia,,daughter of Melvina,,daughter of Katie, born 1878,,Parish County, Louisiana. 
 T. Morgan Dixon: And my name is Morgan,,daughter of Carol,ndaughter of Letha, daughter of Willie,,daughter of Sarah,nborn 1849 in Bardstown, Kentucky. 
 VG: And in the tradition of our families,,the great oral traditionnof almost every black church we know,honoring the culturenfrom which we draw so much power,,we're gonna start the way our mommasnand grandmas would want us to start. 
 TMD: In prayer. Let the words of my mouth,,the meditation of our hearts,nbe acceptable in thy sight,,oh Lord, my strength and my redeemer. 
 VG: We call the names and ritualsnof our ancestors into this room today,because from them we receivedna powerful blueprint for survival,,strategies and tactics for healingncarried across oceans by African women,,passed down to generationsnof black women in America,who used those skillsnto navigate institutions of slavery,and state-sponsored discrimination,in order that we mightnstand on this stage.,We walk in the footsteps of those women,,our foremothers, legends,like Ella Baker, Septima Clark,nFannie Lou Hamer,,from whom we learnednthe power of organizing,after she would hadnsingle-handedly registered,60,000 voters in Jim Crow Mississippi. 
 TMD: 60,000 is a lot of people,nso if you can imagine,me and Vanessa inspiringn60,000 women to walk with us last year,,we were fired up.,But today, 100,000 black women and girlsnstand on this stage with us.,We are committed to healing ourselves,,to lacing up our sneakers,nto walking out of our front door,every single day for total healingnand transformation in our communities,,because we understand,that we are in the footstepsnof a civil rights legacy,like no other time before,,and that we are facing a health crisisnlike never ever before.,And so we've hadna lot of moments, great moments,,including the time we had on our pajamas,nwe were working on our computer,and Michelle Obama emailed usnand invited us to the White House,,and we thought it was spam.,But this moment here is an opportunity.,It is an opportunitynthat we don't take for granted,,and so we thought long and hardnabout how we would use it.,Would we talk to the womennwe hope to inspire,,a million in the next year,,or would we talk to you?,We decided to talk to you,,and to talk to you about a questionnthat we get all the time,,so that the millions of womennwho hopefully will watch this,will never have to answer it again.,It is: Why are black women dying,faster and at higher rates,than any other group of people in America,from preventable,nobesity-related diseases? 
 The question hurts me.,I'm shaking a little bit.,It feels value-laden.,It hurts my body because the weightnrepresents so much.,But we're going to talk about it,and invite you intonan inside conversation today,because it is necessary,nand because we need you. 
 VG: Each night,nbefore the first day of school,,my grandmothernwould sit me next to the stove,and with expert precisionnuse a hot comb to press my hair.,My grandmother was legendary, big, loud.,She filled up a room with laughternand oftentimes curse words.,She cooked a mean peach cobbler,,had 11 children,na house full of grandchildren,,and like every black woman I know,,like most all women I know,,she had prioritized the care of othersnover caring for herself.,We measured her strength by her capacitynto endure pain and suffering.,We celebrated her for it,nand our choice would prove to be deadly.,One night after pressing my hairnbefore the first day of eighth grade,,my grandmother went to bednand never woke up,,dead at 66 years old from a heart attack.,By the time I would graduate college,,I would lose two more belovednfamily members to chronic disease:,my aunt Diane, dead at 55,nmy aunt Tricia, dead at 63.,After living with these losses,nthe hole that they left,,I decided to calculate the life expectancynof the women in my family.,Staring back at me, the number 65.,I knew I could not sit by,and watch another woman I lovedndie an early death. 
 TMD: So we don't usuallynput our business in the streets.,Let's just put that out there.,But I have to tell you the statistics.,Black women are dying at alarming rates,,and I used to be a classroom teacher,,and I was at South Atlanta High School,,and I remember standingnin front of my classroom,,and I remember a statisticnthat half of black girls will get diabetes,unless diet and levels of activity change.,Half of the girls in my classroom.nSo I couldn't teach anymore.,So I started taking girls hiking,nwhich is why we're called GirlTrek,,but Vanessa was like,,that is not going to move the dialnon the health crisis; it's cute.,She was like, it's a cute hiking club.,So what we thought,is if we could rallyna million of their mothers ...,82 percent of black womennare over a healthy weight right now.,53 percent of us are obese.,But the number that I cannot,,that I cannot get out of my head,is that every single day in America,,137 black women,die from a preventable disease,,heart disease.,That's every 11 minutes.,137 is more than gun violence,,cigarette smoking and HIV combined,,every day.,It is roughly the amount of people,that were on my planenfrom New Jersey to Vancouver.,Can you imagine that?,A plane filled with black womenncrashing to the ground every day,,and no one is talking about it. 
 VG: So the question that you're allnasking yourselves right now is why?,Why are black women dying?nWe asked ourselves that same question.,Why is what's out therennot working for them?,Private weight loss companies,ngovernment interventions,,public health campaigns.,I'm going to tell you why:,because they focus on weight loss,or looking good in skinny jeans,without acknowledging the trauma,that black womennhold in our bellies and bones,,that has been embedded in our very DNA.,The best advicenfrom hospitals and doctors,,the best medicationsnfrom pharmaceutical companies,to treat the congestive heart failurenof my grandmother didn't work,because they didn't acknowledgenthe systemic racism,that she had dealt with since birth. 
 (Applause) 
 A divestment in schools,ndiscriminatory housing practices,,predatory lending,na crack cocaine epidemic,,mass incarceration puttingnmore black bodies behind bars,than were owned at the height of slavery. 
 But GirlTrek does.,For black women whose bodiesnare buckling under the weight,of systems never designed to support them,,GirlTrek is a lifeline.,August 16, 2015, Danita Kimball,na member of GirlTrek in Detroit,,received the news that too manynblack mothers have received.,Her son Norman, 23 years old,na father of two,,was gunned downnwhile on an afternoon drive.,Imagine the grief,that overcomes your body in that moment,,the immobilizing fear.,Now, know this, that just daysnafter laying her son to rest,,Danita Kimball posted online,,"I don't know what to donor how to move forward,,but my sisters keep telling menI need to walk, so I will.",And then just days after that,,"I got my steps in today for my baby Norm.,It felt good to be out there, to walk." 
 TMD: Walking through painnis what we have always done.,My mom, she's in the middle right there,,my mom desegregatednher high school in 1955.,Her mom walked down the stepsnof an abandoned school bus,where she raised 11 kidsnas a sharecropper.,And her mom stepped onto Indian territory,fleeing the terrors of the Jim Crow South.,And her mom walked her man to the door,as he went off to fightnin the Kentucky Colored Regiment,,the Civil War.,They were born slavesnbut they wouldn't die slaves.,Change-making, it's in my blood.,It's what I do,,and this health crisis ain't nothingncompared to the road we have traveled. 
 (Applause) 
 So it's like James Cleveland.,I don't feel no ways tired,nso we got to work.,We started looking at models of change.,We looked all over the world.,We needed something,not only that was a partnof our cultural inheritance like walking,,but something that was scalable,nsomething that was high-impact,,something that we could replicatenacross this country.,So we studied models like Wangari Maathai,nwho won the Nobel Peace Prize,for inspiring womennto plant 50 million trees in Kenya.,She brought Kenya back from the brinknof environmental devastation.,We studied these systems of change,nand we looked at walking scientifically.,And what we learnednis that walking just 30 minutes a day,can single-handedly decreasen50 percent of your risk of diabetes,,heart disease, stroke,neven Alzheimer's and dementia.,We know that walkingnis the single most powerful thing,that a woman can do for her health,,so we knew we were on to something,,because from Harriet Tubmannto the women in Montgomery,,when black women walk, things change. 
 (Applause) 
 VG: So how did we takenthis simple idea of walking,and start a revolutionnthat would catch a fire,in neighborhoods across America?,We used the best practicesnof the Civil Rights Movement.,We huddled up in church basements.,We did grapevine information sharingnthrough beauty salons.,We empowered and trained mothersnto stand on the front lines.,We took our messagendirectly to the streets,,and women responded.,Women like LaKeisha in Chattanooga,,Chrysantha in Detroit,,Onika in New Orleans,,women with difficult namesnand difficult stories,join GirlTrek every day and commitnto walking as a practice of self-care.,Once walking, those womennget to organizing,,first their families,nthen their communities,,to walk and talknand solve problems together.,They walk and noticenthe abandoned building.,They walk and noticenthe lack of sidewalks,,the lack of green space,,and they say, "No more.",Women like Susie Paige in Philadelphia,,who after walking daily pastnan abandoned building in her neighborhood,,decided, "I'm not waiting.,Let me rally my team.nLet me grab some supplies.,Let me do what no one else has donenfor me and my community." 
 TMD: We know one womanncan make a difference,,because one womannhas already changed the world,,and her name is Harriet Tubman.,And trust me, I love Harriet Tubman.,I'm obsessed with her,nand I used to be a history teacher.,I will not tell you the whole history.,I will tell you four things.,So I used to have an old Saab --,the kind of canvas top that dripsnon your head when it rains --,and I drove all the way downnto the eastern shore of Maryland,,and when I stepped on the dirt,that Harriet Tubman made her first escape,,I knew she was a woman just like we are,and that we could do what she had done,,and we learned four thingsnfrom Harriet Tubman. 
 The first one: do not wait.,Walk right now in the directionnof your healthiest, most fulfilled life,,because self-care is a revolutionary act. 
 Number two:,when you learn the way forward,ncome back and get a sister.,So in our case,nstart a team with your friends --,your friends, your family, your church. 
 Number three:,rally your allies.,Every single person in this room,is complicit inna Tubman-inspired takeover. 
 And number four:,find joy.,The most underreportednfact of Harriet Tubman,is that she lived to be 93 years old,,and she didn't livenjust an ordinary life; uh-uh.,She was standing up for the good guys.nShe married a younger man.,She adopted a child.nI'm not kidding. She lived.,And I drove up to her housenof freedom in upstate New York,,and she had planted apple trees,,and when I was there on a Sunday,nthey were blooming.,Do you call it -- do they bloom?,The apples were in season,,and I was thinking, she left fruit for us,,the legacy of Harriet Tubman,nevery single year.,And we know that we are Harriet,,and we know that there is a Harrietnin every community in America. 
 VG: We also know that there's a Harrietnin every community across the globe,,and that they could learnnfrom our Tubman Doctrine,,as we call it, the four steps.,Imagine the possibilities,beyond the neighborhoodsnof Oakland and Newark,,to the women workingnrice fields in Vietnam,,tea fields in Sri Lanka,,the women on thenmountainsides in Guatemala,,the indigenous reservationsnthroughout the vast plains of the Dakotas.,We believe that women walking,and talking togethernto solve their problems,is a global solution. 
 TMD: And I'll leave you with this,,because we also believe it can becomenthe center of social justice again.,Vanessa and I were in Fort Lauderdale.,We had an organizer training,,and I was leavingnand I got on the airplane,,and I saw someone I knew, so I waved,,and as I'm waiting in that long linenthat you guys know,,waiting for peoplento put their stuff away,,I looked back and I realized I didn'tnknow the woman but I recognized her.,And so I blew her a kissnbecause it was Sybrina Fulton,,Trayvon Martin's mom,,and she whispered "thank you" back to me.,And I can't help but wondernwhat would happen,if there were groups of womennwalking on Trayvon's block that day,,or what would happennin the South Side of Chicago every day,if there were groups of womennand mothers and aunts and cousins,walking,,or along the polluted riversnof Flint, Michigan.,I believe that walkingncan transform our communities,,because it's already starting to. 
 VG: We believe thatnthe personal is political.,Our walking is for healing,nfor joy, for fresh air,,quiet time, to connectnand disconnect, to worship.,But it's also walkingnso we can be healthy enough,to stand on the front linesnfor change in our communities,,and it is our call to actionnto every black woman listening,,every black woman in earshot of our voice,,every black woman who you know.,Think about it: the woman workingnfront desk reception at your job,,the woman who deliversnyour mail, your neighbor --,our call to action to them,nto join us on the front lines,for change in your community. 
 TMD: And I'll bring us back to this moment,and why it's so importantnfor my dear, dear friend Vanessa and I.,It's because it's not always easy for us,,and in fact, we have both seennreally, really dark days,,from the hate speech to the summernof police brutality and violence,that we saw last year,,to even losing one of our walkers,,Sandy Bland, who died in police custody.,But the most courageous thingnwe do every day is we practice faith,that goes beyond the facts,,and we put feet to our prayersnevery single day,,and when we get overwhelmed,,we think of the words of peoplenlike Sonia Sanchez, a poet laureate,,who says, "Morgan, where is your fire?,Where is the fire that burnednholes through slave ships,to make us breathe?,Where is the firenthat turned guts into chitlins,,that took rhythms and make jazz,,that took sit-ins and marchesnand made us jump boundaries and barriers?,You've got to find it and pass it on." 
 So this is us finding our firenand passing it on to you.,So please, stand with us,,walk with us as we rally a million women,to reclaim the streetsnof the 50 highest need communities,in this country. 
 We thank you so much for this opportunity. 
 (Applause)I have a two-year-old daughter named Naya,who is under the mistaken impression,that this conferencenis named in honor of her father. 
 (Laughter) 
 Who am I to contradict my baby girl? 
 As many of you know, there's somethingnabout becoming a parent,that concentrates the mindnon long-term problems like climate change.,It was the birth of my daughternthat inspired me,to launch this climate organization,,in order to counteract the excessivenpolarization of this issue,in the United States,,and to find a conservativenpathway forward.,Yes, folks, a Republicannclimate solution is possible,,and you know what?,It may even be better. 
 (Laughter) 
 Let me try to prove that to you. 
 What we really neednis a killer app to climate policy.,In the technology world, a killer appnis an application so transformative,that it creates its own market,,like Uber.,In the climate world,,a killer app is a newnsolution so promising,that it can break throughnthe seemingly insurmountable,barriers to progress.,These include the psychological barrier.,Climate advocates have longnbeen encouraging their fellow citizens,to make short-term sacrifices now,for benefits that accrue to other people,in other countries 30 or 40nyears in the future.,It just doesn't fly because it runsncontrary to basic human nature. 
 Next is the geopolitical barrier.,Under the current rules of global trade,,countries have a strong incentivento free ride off the emissions reductions,of other nations,,instead of strengtheningntheir own programs.,This has been the curse,of every internationalnclimate negotiations, including Paris.,Finally, we have the partisan barrier.,Even the most committed countries --,Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada --,are nowhere near reducing emissionsnat the required scale and speed.,Not even close.,And the partisan climate dividenis far more acute,here in the United States.,We are fundamentally stuck,,and that is why we needna killer app of climate policy,to break through each of these barriers. 
 I'm convinced that the roadnto climate progress in the United States,runs through the Republican Party,and the business community.,So in launchingnthe Climate Leadership Council,,I started by reaching out to a who's whonof Republican elder statesmen,and business leaders,,including James Baker and George Schultz,,the two most respected Republicannelder statesmen in America;,Martin Feldstein and Greg Mankiw,,the two most respectednconservative economists in the country;,and Henry Paulson and Rob Walton,,two of the most successfulnand admired business leaders.,Together, we co-authored,"The Conservative CasenFor Carbon Dividends.",This represents the first time,that Republican leaders put forth,a concrete market-based climate solution. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 We presented our plan at the White House,two weeks after President Trump moved in.,Almost every leadingneditorial board in the country,has since endorsed our plan,,and Fortune 100 companiesnfrom a wide range of industries,are now getting behind it.,So by now you're probably wondering,,what exactly is this plan? 
 Well, our carbon dividends solutionnis based on four pillars.,The first is a graduallynrising carbon tax.,Although capitalism is a wonderful system,,like many operating systems,nit's prone to bugs,,which, in this case, are calledn"market failures.",By far the largest is thatnmarket prices fail to take,social and environmentalncosts into account.,That means every market transactionnis based on incorrect information.,This fundamental bug of capitalism,nmore than any other single factor,,is to blame for our climate predicament. 
 Now in theory, this should benan easy problem to fix.,Economists agree,that the best solution is to put a pricenon the carbon content of fossil fuels,,otherwise known as a carbon tax.,This would discourage carbon emissions,in every single economic transaction,,every day of the year.,However, a carbon tax by itselfnhas proven to be unpopular,and a political dead end.,The answer is to returnnall the money raised,directly to citizens,,in the form of equal monthly dividends.,This would transformnan unpopular carbon tax,into a popular and populist solution,,and it would also solve,the underlying psychological barriernthat we discussed,,by giving everyone a concrete benefitnin the here and now. 
 And these benefits would be significant.,Assuming a carbon tax ratenthat starts at 40 dollars per ton,,a family of four would receiven2,000 dollars per year,from the get-go.,According to the US Treasury Department,,the bottom 70 percent of Americansnwould receive more in dividends,than they would paynin increased energy prices.,That means 223 million Americansnwould win economically,from solving climate change.,And that -- 
 (Applause) 
 is revolutionary,,and could fundamentallynalter climate politics. 
 But there's anothernrevolutionary element here.,The amount of the dividend would grow,as the carbon tax rate increases.,The more we protect our climate,,the more our citizens benefit.,This creates a positive feedback loop,,which is crucial,,because the only way we will reachnour long-term emission-reduction goals,is if the carbon tax ratengoes up every year. 
 The third pillar of our programnis eliminating regulations,that are no longer needed,once a carbon dividends plan is enacted.,This is a key selling pointnto Republicans and business leaders.,So why should we trade,climate regulations for a price on carbon?,Well, let me show you.,Our plan would achieve nearly twicenthe emissions reductions,of all Obama-era climatenregulations combined,,and nearly three times the new baseline,after President Trump repealsnall of those regulations.,That assumes a carbon taxnstarting at 40 dollars per ton,,which translates into roughlynan extra 36 cents per gallon of gas.,Our plan by itself,would meet the high endnof America's commitment,under the Paris Climate Agreement,,and as you can see,,the emissions reductionsnwould continue over time.,This illustrates the powernof a conservative climate solution,based on free marketsnand limited government.,We would end up with less regulation,and far less pollution at the same time,,while helping working-classnAmericans get ahead.,Doesn't that sound like somethingnwe could all support? 
 (Applause) 
 The fourth and final pillar of our programnis a new climate domino effect,,based on border carbon adjustments.,Now that may sound complicated,,but it, too, is revolutionary,,because it provides usna whole new strategy,to reach a global price on carbon,,which is ultimately what we need.,Let me show you an example.,Suppose Country A adoptsna carbon dividends plan,,and Country B does not.,Well, to level the playing field,and protect the competitivenessnof its industries,,Country A would tax imports from Country B,based on their carbon content.,Fair enough.,But here's where it getsnreally interesting,,because the money raised at the bordernwould increase the dividends,going to the citizens of Country A.,Well, how long do you think it would takenthe public in Country B to realize,that that money should be going to them,,and to push for a carbonndividends plan in their own land?,Add a few more countries,,and we get a new climate domino effect. 
 Once one major country or regionnadopts carbon dividends,with border carbon adjustments,,other countries are compellednto follow suit.,One by one the dominoes fall.,And this domino effectncould start anywhere.,My preference, strongly,nis the United States,,but it could also startnin the United Kingdom,,in Germany or another European country,,or even in China. 
 Let's take China as an example.,China is committed to reducingngreenhouse gas emissions,,but what its leaders care even more about,is transitioning their economynto consumer-led economic development.,Well, nothing could do morento hasten that transition,than giving every Chinese citizenna monthly dividend.,In fact, this is the only policy solution,that would enable China to meetnits environmental and economic goals,at the same time. 
 That's why this is the killer appnof climate policy,,because it would enable us to overcome,each of the barriers we discussed earlier:,the psychological barrier,nthe partisan barrier,,and, as we've just seen,nthe geopolitical barrier.,All we need is a country to lead the way.,And one method of findingnwhat you're looking for,is to take out an ad.,So let's read this one together. 
 Wanted: country to pioneerncarbon dividends plan.,Cost to country: zero.,Starting date: as soon as possible.,Advantages: most effectivenclimate solution,,popular and populist,,pro-growth and pro-business,,shrinks governmentnand helps the working class.,Additional compensation: gratitudenof current and future generations,,including my daughter. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: Just onenquestion for you, Ted.,I'm actually not sure,I've seen a conservativenget a standing O at TED before that.,That's pretty cool.,The logic seems really powerful,,but some people you talk to in politics,say it's hard to imagine thisnstill getting through Congress.,How are you feelingnabout momentum behind this? 
 Ted Halstead: So I understandnthat many are very pessimistic,about what's happening innthe United States with President Trump.,I'm less pessimistic; here's why.,The actions of this White House,nthe early actions on climate,,are just the first movenin a complex game of climate chess.,So far it's been a repeal-only strategy;,the pressure is going to mount nfor a replacement program,,which is where we come in.,And there are three reasons why,nwhich I'll go through real quickly. 
 One, the business communitynis fundamentally parting ways,with the White House on climate change.,In fact, we're finding,a number of Fortune 100 companiesnsupporting our program.,Within two months,nwe're going to be announcing,some really surprising namesncoming out in favor of this program.,Two, there is no issuenin American politics,where there's a more fundamental gapnbetween the Republican base,and the Republican leadershipnthan climate change.,And three, thinking ofnthis analogy of chess,,the big decision up ahead is:nDoes the administration stay in Paris?,Well, let's pan it out both ways.,If it stays in Paris, as manynare pushing for in the administration,,well then that begs a question:nWhat's the plan?,We have the plan.,But if they don't stay in Paris,,the international pressurenwill be overwhelming.,Our Secretary of State will be askingnother countries for NATO contributions,,and they'll be saying,n"No, give us our Paris commitment.,Come through on your commitments,nwe'll come through on ours." 
 So, international, businessnand even the Republican base,will all be calling forna Republican replacement plan.,And, hopefully, we've provided one. 
 CA: Thank you so much, Ted. 
 TH: Thank you, Chris. 
 (Applause)So, this happy pic of menwas taken in 1999.,I was a senior in college,,and it was right after a dance practice.,I was really, really happy.,And I remember exactly where I wasnabout a week and a half later.,I was sitting in the backnof my used minivan,in a campus parking lot,,when I decided,I was going to commit suicide.,I went from decidingnto full-blown planning very quickly.,And I came this closento the edge of the precipice.,It's the closest I've ever come.,And the only reason I tooknmy finger off the trigger,was thanks to a few lucky coincidences.,And after the fact,,that's what scared me the most:nthe element of chance. 
 So I became very methodicalnabout testing different ways,that I could manage my ups and downs,,which has proven to bena good investment. (Laughs),Many normal people might have,nsay, six to 10 major depressive episodes,in their lives.,I have bipolar depression.nIt runs in my family.,I've had 50-plus at this point,,and I've learned a lot.,I've had a lot of at-bats,,many rounds in the ring with darkness,,taking good notes.,So I thought rather than get upnand give any type of recipe for success,or highlight reel,,I would share my recipenfor avoiding self-destruction,,and certainly self-paralysis. 
 And the tool I've found which has provennto be the most reliable safety net,for emotional free fall,is actually the same tool,that has helped me to makenmy best business decisions.,But that is secondary.,And it is ... stoicism.,That sounds boring. 
 (Laughter) 
 You might think of Spock,,or it might conjure and image like this -- 
 (Laughter) 
 a cow standing in the rain.,It's not sad. It's not particularly happy.,It's just an impassive creature takingnwhatever life sends its way. 
 You might not think of the ultimatencompetitor, say, Bill Belichick,,head coach of the New England Patriots,,who has the all-time NFL recordnfor Super Bowl titles.,And stoicism has spread like wildfirenin the top of the NFL ranks,as a means of mental toughnessntraining in the last few years.,You might not thinknof the Founding Fathers --,Thomas Jefferson, John Adams,nGeorge Washington,to name but three students of stoicism.,George Washington actually hadna play about a Stoic --,this was "Cato, a Tragedy" --,performed for his troops at Valley Forgento keep them motivated. 
 So why would people of actionnfocus so much on an ancient philosophy?,This seems very academic.,I would encourage you to thinknabout stoicism a little bit differently,,as an operating system for thrivingnin high-stress environments,,for making better decisions.,And it all started here,,kind of,,on a porch. 
 So around 300 BC in Athens,,someone named Zeno of Citiumntaught many lectures,walking around a painted porch, a "stoa.",That later became "stoicism.",And in the Greco-Roman world,,people used stoicismnas a comprehensive system,for doing many, many things.,But for our purposes, chief among themnwas training yourself,to separate what you can controlnfrom what you cannot control,,and then doing exercisesnto focus exclusively,on the former.,This decreases emotional reactivity,,which can be a superpower. 
 Conversely, let's saynyou're a quarterback.,You miss a pass.nYou get furious with yourself.,That could cost you a game.,If you're a CEO, and you flynoff the handle at a very valued employee,because of a minor infraction,,that could cost you the employee.,If you're a college studentnwho, say, is in a downward spiral,,and you feel helpless and hopeless,,unabated, that could cost you your life.,So the stakes are very, very high. 
 And there are many toolsnin the toolkit to get you there.,I'm going to focus on onenthat completely changed my life in 2004.,It found me then because of two things:,a very close friend, young guy, my age,ndied of pancreatic cancer unexpectedly,,and then my girlfriend, who I thoughtnI was going to marry, walked out.,She'd had enough, and she didn'tngive me a Dear John letter,,but she did give me this,,a Dear John plaque. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm not making this up. I've kept it.,"Business hours are over at five o'clock.",She gave this to mento put on my desk for personal health,,because at the time, I was workingnon my first real business.,I had no idea what I was doing.nI was working 14-plus hour days,,seven days a week.,I was using stimulants to get going.,I was using depressantsnto wind down and go to sleep.,It was a disaster.,I felt completely trapped.,I bought a book on simplicitynto try to find answers. 
 And I did find a quotenthat made a big difference in my life,,which was, "We suffer more oftennin imagination than in reality,",by Seneca the Younger,,who was a famous Stoic writer.,That took me to his letters,,which took me to the exercise,,"premeditatio malorum,",which means the pre-meditation of evils.,In simple terms,,this is visualizing the worst-casenscenarios, in detail, that you fear,,preventing you from taking action,,so that you can take actionnto overcome that paralysis.,My problem was monkey mind --nsuper loud, very incessant.,Just thinking my waynthrough problems doesn't work.,I needed to capture my thoughts on paper.,So I created a written exercise,that I called "fear-setting,"nlike goal-setting,,for myself.,It consists of three pages.,Super simple. 
 The first page is right here.,"What if I ...?",This is whatever you fear,,whatever is causing you anxiety,,whatever you're putting off.,It could be asking someone out,,ending a relationship,,asking for a promotion,nquitting a job, starting a company.,It could be anything.,For me, it was takingnmy first vacation in four years,and stepping away from my businessnfor a month to go to London,,where I could staynin a friend's room for free,,to either remove myselfnas a bottleneck in the business,or shut it down. 
 In the first column, "Define,",you're writing down all of the worstnthings you can imagine happening,if you take that step.,You want 10 to 20.,I won't go through all of them,nbut I'll give you two examples.,One was, I'll go to London,nit'll be rainy, I'll get depressed,,the whole thing will bena huge waste of time.,Number two, I'll missna letter from the IRS,,and I'll get audited,or raided or shut down or some such. 
 And then you go to the "Prevent" column.,In that column, you writendown the answer to:,What could I do to preventneach of these bullets from happening,,or, at the very least, decreasenthe likelihood even a little bit?,So for getting depressed in London,,I could take a portable blue light with me,and use it for 15 minutes in the morning.,I knew that helped stave offndepressive episodes.,For the IRS bit, I could changenthe mailing address on file with the IRS,so the paperwork would go to my accountant,instead of to my UPS address.,Easy-peasy. 
 Then we go to "Repair.",So if the worst-case scenarios happen,,what could you do to repairnthe damage even a little bit,,or who could you ask for help?,So in the first case, London,,well, I could fork over some money,nfly to Spain, get some sun --,undo the damage, if I got into a funk.,In the case of missingna letter from the IRS,,I could call a friend who is a lawyer,or ask, say, a professor of law,what they would recommend,,who I should talk to,nhow had people handled this in the past.,So one question to keep in mindnas you're doing this first page is:,Has anyone else in the history of time,less intelligent or less driven,figured this out?,Chances are, the answer is "Yes." 
 (Laughter) 
 The second page is simple:,What might be the benefitsnof an attempt or a partial success?,You can see we're playing up the fears,and really taking a conservativenlook at the upside.,So if you attempted whatevernyou're considering,,might you build confidence,ndevelop skills,,emotionally, financially, otherwise?,What might be the benefitsnof, say, a base hit?,Spend 10 to 15 minutes on this. 
 Page three.,This might be the most important,nso don't skip it:,"The Cost of Inaction.",Humans are very good at consideringnwhat might go wrong,if we try something new,nsay, ask for a raise.,What we don't often considernis the atrocious cost of the status quo --,not changing anything.,So you should ask yourself,,if I avoid this action or decision,and actions and decisions like it,,what might my life look like in,nsay, six months, 12 months, three years?,Any further out, it startsnto seem intangible.,And really get detailed --nagain, emotionally, financially,,physically, whatever. 
 And when I did this, it paintedna terrifying picture.,I was self-medicating,,my business was going to implodenat any moment at all times,,if I didn't step away.,My relationships were fraying or failing.,And I realized that inactionnwas no longer an option for me. 
 Those are the three pages. That's it.nThat's fear-setting.,And after this, I realizednthat on a scale of one to 10,,one being minimal impact,n10 being maximal impact,,if I took the trip, I was risking,a one to three of temporarynand reversible pain,for an eight to 10 of positive,nlife-changing impact,that could be a semi-permanent.,So I took the trip.,None of the disasters came to pass.,There were some hiccups, sure.,I was able to extricate myselfnfrom the business.,I ended up extending that tripnfor a year and a half around the world,,and that became the basisnfor my first book,,that leads me here today. 
 And I can trace all of my biggest wins,and all of my biggest disasters averted,back to doing fear-setting,at least once a quarter.,It's not a panacea.,You'll find that some of your fearsnare very well-founded. 
 (Laughter) 
 But you shouldn't conclude that,without first putting themnunder a microscope.,And it doesn't make all the hard times,nthe hard choices, easy,,but it can make a lot of them easier. 
 I'd like to close with a profilenof one of my favorite modern-day Stoics.,This is Jerzy Gregorek.,He is a four-time world championnin Olympic weightlifting,,political refugee,,published poet,,62 years old.,He can still kick my ass and probablynmost asses in this room.,He's an impressive guy. 
 I spent a lot of timenon his stoa, his porch,,asking life and training advice.,He was part of the Solidarity in Poland,,which was a nonviolentnmovement for social change,that was violently suppressednby the government.,He lost his career as a firefighter.,Then his mentor, a priest,nwas kidnapped, tortured, killed,and thrown into a river.,He was then threatened.,He and his wife had to flee Poland,nbounce from country to country,until they landed in the USnwith next to nothing,,sleeping on floors. 
 He now lives in Woodside, California,nin a very nice place,,and of the 10,000-plus peoplenI've met in my life,,I would put him in the top 10,,in terms of success and happiness.,And there's a punchline coming,nso pay attention.,I sent him a text a few weeks ago,,asking him: Had he ever readnany Stoic philosophy?,And he replied with two pages of text.,This is very unlike him.nHe is a terse dude. 
 (Laughter) 
 And not only was he familiarnwith stoicism,,but he pointed out, for allnof his most important decisions,,his inflection points,,when he stood upnfor his principles and ethics,,how he had used stoicismnand something akin to fear-setting,,which blew my mind. 
 And he closed with two things.,Number one: he couldn't imaginenany life more beautiful,than that of a Stoic.,And the last was his mantra,nwhich he applies to everything,,and you can apply to everything: 
 "Easy choices, hard life.,Hard choices, easy life." 
 The hard choices --,what we most fear doing, asking, saying --,these are very often exactlynwhat we most need to do.,And the biggest challengesnand problems we face,will never be solvednwith comfortable conversations,,whether it's in your own headnor with other people. 
 So I encourage you to ask yourselves:,Where in your lives right now,might defining your fears be morenimportant than defining your goals?,Keeping in mind all the while,nthe words of Seneca:,"We suffer more oftennin imagination than in reality." 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I love museums.,Have you guys ever beennto the Natural History Museum?,In New York City? 
 (Applause) 
 So one of the things that I donis I take my kids to the museum.,Recently I took themnto the Natural History Museum.,I had my two sons with me,nSabian and Dabith.,And we go into the frontnentrance of the museum,,and there's that amazing sculpturenof Teddy Roosevelt out there.,You guys know which one I'm talking about.,Teddy Roosevelt is sitting therenwith one hand on the horse,,bold, strong, sleeves rolled up.,I don't know if he's bare-chested,nbut it kind of feels like it. 
 (Laughter) 
 And on the left-hand side of himnis a Native American walking.,And on the right-hand side of himnis an African-American walking.,And as we're moving up the stairs,,getting closer to the sculpture,,my oldest son, who's nine, says,,"Dad, how come he gets to ride,,and they have to walk?" 
 It stopped me in my tracks.,It stopped me in my tracks.,There was so much history,that we would have to go throughnto try to explain that,,and that's somethingnI try to do with them anyways.,It's a question that I probablynwould have never really asked.,But fundamentally what he was saying was,,"That doesn't look fair.,Dad, that doesn't look fair.,And why is this thing that's so not fair,sitting outsidenof such an amazing institution.",And his question got me wondering,,is there a way for usnto amend our public sculptures,,our national monuments?,Not erase them,,but is there a way to amend them? 
 Now, I didn't grow up going to museums.,That's not my history.,My mother was 15 years oldnwhen I was born.,She is amazing.,My father was strugglingnwith his own things,for most of my life.,If you really want to know the truth,,the only reason I got into artnis because of a woman.,There was this amazing, amazing,nfantastic, beautiful, smart woman,,four years older than me,,and I wanted to go out with her.,But she said, "You're too young,and you're not thinkingnabout your future.",So I ran on down to the junior college,,registered for some classes,,ran on back,,and basically was like,n"I'm thinking about my future now." 
 (Laughter) 
 "Can we go out?" 
 For the record, she's even more amazing.,I married her. 
 (Applause) 
 So when I randomly ran downnto the junior college,and registered for classes,,I really wasn't paying attentionnto what I was registering to. 
 (Laughter) 
 So I ended up with an art history class,,and I didn't know a thingnabout art history.,But something amazing happenednwhen I went into that class.,For the first time in my academic career,,my visual intelligence was required of me.,For the first time.,The professor would put up an image,,bold strokes of blues and yellows,nand say, "Who's that?",And I'd go, "That's Van Gogh.nClearly that is Van Gogh.,I got this." 
 (Laughter) 
 I got a B in that class.,For me, that was amazing.,In high school, let's just saynI wasn't a great student. OK?,In high school, my GPA was .65. 
 (Laughter) 
 Decimal point first, six five.,So me getting a B was huge, huge,,absolutely huge.,And because of the fact that I realizednthat I was able to learn things visually,that I couldn't learn in other ways,,this became my strategy,nthis became my tactic,for understanding everything else.,I wanted to stay in this relationship.nThings were going well. 
 I decided, let me keep takingnthese art history classes.,One of the last art history classes,nI will not forget, I will never forget.,It was one of those surveynart history classes.,Anybody ever have one of thosensurvey art history classes,,where they try to teach younthe entire history of art,in a single semester?,I'm talking about cave paintingsnand Jackson Pollock,just crunched together all in the same --,It doesn't really work,nbut they try anyway.,Well, at the beginning of the semester,,I looked at the book,,and in this 400-page booknwas about a 14-page section,that was on black people in painting.,Now, this was a crammed in section,that had representationsnof black people in painting,and black people who painted.,It was poorly curated,nlet's just put it that way. 
 (Laughter) 
 Nonetheless I was really excited about it,,because in allnthe other classes that I had,,we didn't even have that conversation.,We didn't talk about it at all.,So imagine my surprise,when I get to class,and on the day that we're supposednto go over that particular chapter,,my professor announces,,"We're going to skip this chapter today,because we do not have timento go through it." 
 "Whoa, I'm sorry,nhold on, professor, professor.,I'm sorry. This is a reallynimportant chapter to me.,Are we going to go over it at any point?" 
 "Titus, we don't have time for this." 
 "I'm sorry, I'm sorry,nI'm sorry, I'm sorry,,please, I really need to understand.,Clearly the author thinksnthat this is significant.,Why are we skipping over this?" 
 "Titus, I do not have time for this." 
 "OK, last question, I'm really sorry here.,When can we talk,nbecause we need to talk." 
 (Laughter) 
 I went to her office hours.,I ended up getting kickednout of her office.,I went to the dean.,The dean finally told me,n"I can't force her to teach anything.",And I knew in that momentnif I wanted to understand this history,,if I wanted to understand the rolesnof those folks who had to walk,,I was probably goingnto have to figure that out myself.,So ...,above you right here on the slide,is a painting by Frans Hals.,This is one of the kinds of images,that was in that chapter.,I taught myself how to paint,by going to museumsnand looking at images like this. 
 I want to show you something. 
 I made this.,I -- 
 (Applause) 
 I made some alterations.,You'll see there arensome slight differences in the painting.,All this art historynthat I had been absorbing,helped me to realizenthat painting is a language.,There is a reason,why he is the highestnin the composition here.,There is a reason,why the painter is showing usnthis gold necklace here.,He's trying to tell us somethingnabout the economic status,of these people in these paintings.,Painting is a visual language,where everything in the painting,is meaningful, is important.,It's coded.,But sometimes, becausenof the compositional structure,,because of compositional hierarchy,,it's hard to see other things.,This silk is supposed to tell us alsonthat they have quite a bit of money.,There's more written,about dogs in art history,than there are aboutnthis other character here.,Historically speaking,nin research on these kinds of paintings,,I can find out more about the lace,that the woman is wearingnin this painting --,the manufacturer of the lace --nthan I can about this character here,,about his dreams, about his hopes,,about what he wanted out of life. 
 I want to show you something.,I don't want you to think,that this is about eradication.,It's not.,The oil that you saw menjust put inside of this paint,is linseed oil.,It becomes transparent over time,,so eventually what's going to happen,is these faces,will emerge a little bit.,What I'm trying to do,,what I'm trying to show you,,is how to shift your gaze just slightly,,just momentarily,,just momentarily,,to ask yourself the question,,why do some have to walk?,What is the impact of these kindsnof sculptures at museums?,What is the impactnof these kinds of paintings,on some of our most vulnerable in society,,seeing these kinds of depictionsnof themselves all the time?,I'm not saying erase it.,We can't erase this history.,It's real. We have to know it.,I think of it in the same way,we think of -- 
 Let me step back a second.,You remember old-school cameras,,where when you took a picture,nyou actually had to focus. Right?,You'd put the camera up,,and if I wanted you in focus,,I would move the lens a little to the left,and you would come forward.,I could move the lensna little to the right,,and you would go back and the folksnin the background would come out.,I'm just trying to do that here.,I'm trying to give you that opportunity.,I'm trying to answer that question,that my son had.,I want to make paintings,,I want to make sculptures,that are honest,,that wrestle withnthe struggles of our past,but speak to the diversitynand the advances of our present.,And we can't do that by taking an erasernand getting rid of stuff.,That's just not going to work.,I think that we shouldndo it in the same way,the American Constitution works.,When we have a situation,where we want to changena law in the American Constitution,,we don't erase the other one.,Alongside that is an amendment,,something that says,,"This is where we were,nbut this is where we are right now.",I figure if we can do that,,then that will help usnunderstand a little bit,about where we're going. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'm here to offer youna new way to think about my field,,artificial intelligence.,I think the purpose of AI,is to empower humansnwith machine intelligence.,And as machines get smarter,,we get smarter.,I call this "humanistic AI" --,artificial intelligencendesigned to meet human needs,by collaborating and augmenting people.,Now, today I'm happy to see,that the idea of an intelligent assistant,is mainstream.,It's the well-accepted metaphornfor the interface between humans and AI.,And the one I helped createnis called Siri. 
 You know Siri.,Siri is the thing that knows your intent,and helps you do it for you,,helps you get things done.,But what you might not knownis that we designed Siri,as humanistic AI,,to augment peoplenwith a conversational interface,that made it possible for themnto use mobile computing,,regardless of who they werenand their abilities. 
 Now for most of us,,the impact of this technology,is to make thingsna little bit easier to use.,But for my friend Daniel,,the impact of the AInin these systems is a life changer.,You see, Daniel is a really social guy,,and he's blind and quadriplegic,,which makes it hard to use those devicesnthat we all take for granted.,The last time I was at his house,nhis brother said,,"Hang on a second, Daniel's not ready.,He's on the phone with a womannhe met online.",I'm like, "That's cool, how'd he do it?",Well, Daniel uses Sirinto manage his own social life --,his email, text and phone --,without depending on his caregivers.,This is kind of interesting, right?,The irony here is great.,Here's the man whose relationship with AI,helps him have relationshipsnwith genuine human beings.,And this is humanistic AI. 
 Another example withnlife-changing consequences,is diagnosing cancer.,When a doctor suspects cancer,,they take a samplenand send it to a pathologist,,who looks at it under a microscope.,Now, pathologists look atnhundreds of slides,and millions of cells every day.,So to support this task,,some researchers made an AI classifier.,Now, the classifier says,n"Is this cancer or is this not cancer?",looking at the pictures.,The classifier was pretty good,,but not as good as the person,,who got it right most of the time. 
 But when they combine the abilitynof the machine and the human together,,accuracy went to 99.5 percent.,Adding that AI to a partnershipneliminated 85 percent of the errors,that the human pathologistnwould have made working alone.,That's a lot of cancernthat would have otherwise gone untreated.,Now, for the curious, it turns out,that the human was betternat rejecting false positives,,and the machine was betternat recognizing those hard-to-spot cases.,But the lesson here isn't aboutnwhich agent is better,at this image-classification task.,Those things are changing every day.,The lesson here,is that by combining the abilitiesnof the human and machine,,it created a partnershipnthat had superhuman performance.,And that is humanistic AI. 
 Now let's look at another example,with turbocharging performance.,This is design.,Now, let's say you're an engineer.,You want to designna new frame for a drone.,You get out your favoritensoftware tools, CAD tools,,and you enter the form and the materials,nand then you analyze performance.,That gives you one design.,If you give those same tools to an AI,,it can generate thousands of designs. 
 This video by Autodesk is amazing.,This is real stuff.,So this transforms how we do design.,The human engineer now,says what the design should achieve,,and the machine says,,"Here's the possibilities.",Now in her job, the engineer's job,is to pick the one that best meetsnthe goals of the design,,which she knows as a humannbetter than anyone else,,using human judgment and expertise.,In this case, the winning form,looks kind of like somethingnnature would have designed,,minus a few million years of evolution,and all that unnecessary fur. 
 Now let's see where this ideanof humanistic AI might lead us,if we follow it intonthe speculative beyond.,What's a kind of augmentationnthat we would all like to have?,Well, how about cognitive enhancement?,Instead of asking,,"How smart can we make our machines?",let's ask,"How smart can our machines make us?",I mean, take memory for example.,Memory is the foundationnof human intelligence.,But human memory is famously flawed.,We're great at telling stories,,but not getting the details right.,And our memories -- they decay over time.,I mean, like, where did the '60s go,nand can I go there, too? 
 (Laughter) 
 But what if you could have a memorynthat was as good as computer memory,,and was about your life?,What if you could remembernevery person you ever met,,how to pronounce their name,,their family details,ntheir favorite sports,,the last conversation you had with them?,If you had this memory all your life,,you could have the AI looknat all the interactions,you had with people over time,and help you reflect on the long arcnof your relationships.,What if you could have the AI readneverything you've ever read,and listen to every songnyou've ever heard?,From the tiniest clue,nit could help you retrieve,anything you've ever seen or heard before.,Imagine what that would donfor the ability to make new connections,and form new ideas. 
 And what about our bodies?,What if we could remember the consequencesnof every food we eat,,every pill we take,,every all-nighter we pull?,We could do our own sciencenon our own data,about what makes us feelngood and stay healthy.,And imagine how this could revolutionize,the way we managenallergies and chronic disease. 
 I believe that AI will makenpersonal memory enhancement a reality.,I can't say when or whatnform factors are involved,,but I think it's inevitable,,because the very thingsnthat make AI successful today --,the availability of comprehensive data,and the ability for machinesnto make sense of that data --,can be applied to the data of our lives.,And those data are here today,navailable for all of us,,because we lead digitally mediated lives,,in mobile and online. 
 In my view, a personal memorynis a private memory.,We get to choose what is and is notnrecalled and retained.,It's absolutely essentialnthat this be kept very secure. 
 Now for most of us,,the impact of augmented personal memory,will be a more improved mental gain,,maybe, hopefully, a bit more social grace.,But for the millions who suffernfrom Alzheimer's and dementia,,the difference that augmentednmemory could make,is a differencenbetween a life of isolation,and a life of dignity and connection. 
 We are in the middle of a renaissancenin artificial intelligence right now.,I mean, in just the past few years,,we're beginning to seensolutions to AI problems,that we have strugglednwith literally for decades:,speech understanding, text understanding,,image understanding.,We have a choice in how we usenthis powerful technology.,We can choose to use AInto automate and compete with us,,or we can use AI to augmentnand collaborate with us,,to overcome our cognitive limitations,and to help us do what we want to do,,only better.,And as we discover new waysnto give machines intelligence,,we can distribute that intelligence,to all of the AI assistants in the world,,and therefore to every person,nregardless of circumstance.,And that is why,,every time a machine gets smarter,,we get smarter. 
 That is an AI worth spreading. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)This is my favorite place on earth,,Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia.,And when it's coverednin a thin layer of water,,it reflects the clouds.,There are days when you feelnas if you're floating among the clouds.,But there are daysnwhen the horizon disappears;,there's no longer a top or a bottom.,You feel immersed in something bigger. 
 It was there that one nightnI woke up from a dream,,and I saw that the starsnwere also reflected on the water.,And that wasn't a dream.,It was as if you could walknamong the stars.,With every step I took,nthe stars reverberated under my feet.,It was like I was floating in the universenamong clouds of galaxies. 
 But what's floating there todaynare not just clouds of galaxies,but also clouds of plastic.,These are the footprintsnwe're leaving on the planet.,They're signs of an era,in which the behavior of some humansnis making a global impact,on our ecosystems.,This era is called the Anthropocene.,There's also another typenof toxic clouds that float in the air,,like the ones that formnfrom carbon dioxide emissions,and from the burning of fossil fuels --noil, carbon, gas --,clouds that, when we see them,,pollute our dreams.,I don't know about all of you,,but I've always dreamed of floatingnamong the clouds.,Maybe today we can imagine togethernother types of clouds,,clouds we can live with. 
 If you're wonderingnabout that photo, I'll explain:,it looks like a collagenor photomontage -- something weird.,No; it's reality.,But sometimes I ask myself:nWhat is reality?,According to Alexander Kluge:,"Human beings are notninterested in reality.,They can’t be; it’s partnof the human essence.,They have desires.,These desires are totally opposednto any form of reality.,They prefer to lie,than to become divorcednfrom their desires.",But how can we learnnto float among the clouds?,As an artist, I thought we could startnbuilding a flying museum.,You're probably wondering:nWith plastic bags? 
 In 2007, with a community of peoplenall over the world,,we began to collect used plastic bags --,not new ones.,And we washed them,,we cut them up,,we glued them together,,and we began to draw on them,,creating a huge canvas.,We made a collection of drawings,,of personal stories,and of friendships.,And when you join them,,bend them and fold them,,it creates a space full of air.,When the sun comes up from the horizon,,the museum rises up to the sky.,That's why we call it,n"The Aero-Solar Museum.",And from this simple idea,,we learned how to float in the airnin a radically new way,,without using any type of fuel.,The difference in temperaturenbetween the interior and the exterior,is what makes us rise up.,That way,,we don't use fossil fuelsnor helium or hydrogen;,we don't use solar panels,or batteries or motors.,We discovered a way that's simple,nclean and accessible to the whole world,to lift ourselves up. 
 I remember when I was at NASA in 2009nwith 120 engineers.,You guys know, too,nwhen you go up in a plane,,the control panels are gigantic.,And what we're doing is really complex,,and when I started coming innwith the plastic bags, saying,,"But we have a different way ...",people had a hard timenunderstanding the concept.,Seeing the power of this idea,,we started to initiate a new era;,one that would leave behindnthe violence of the Anthropocene,and give way to a new era,,which we call the "Aerocene" --,an era of ecological awareness,,in which we learn to float together,nlive together in the air,,and come to an ethical commitment,with the atmosphere and with planet earth.,That's why I've broughtnthis backpack today.,Let's see ... 
 OK. This is a balloonnthat we also refer to as a sculpture.,And if it's sunny out tomorrow,nwe can go out and fly --,though, no, the weathernin Vancouver isn't -- 
 (Laughter) 
 it's not very ...,very favorable. 
 So, what other features does it have?,It has sensors that, when it moves,,make sort of drawings in the air.,It also has other sensors.,I always think that firstnyou have to feel it,,and then you can measure it;,you need to hear the soundsnof the atmosphere,,of the climate, of the hot air,,in order to then measure the ozone,,the carbon dioxide.,We're developing these sensors,together with different communitiesnall over the world,in order to reconnect with the climate,nthe temperature and the environment,,because there are othernspecies in the air;,in these excursionsntowards the atmosphere,,we're not alone.,The air is full of clouds of life.,We live at the bottom of an ocean of air. 
 And this same sculpture,,this exact one in my hands,,flew 375 miles -- 12 hours --nfrom Germany to Poland,,on a fuel-free trip.,But it wasn't free from crossing borders.,The trip was much more complicatednthan what we imagined;,air space is as regulated and militarized,as land space.,To fly using the winds,nthe heat of the sun,and the radiant energy of the earth,is complex and beautiful.,But even more complexnwill be getting the permits,to cross the air spacenof each of the different countries,that we fly over using wind. 
 At COP21, the Paris Climate Conference,,we presented these spherical sculptures,that could transport usnall over the world.,But how can we fly using the windnto arrive at our destination?,Together with MIT, we developed a program,that predicts how we can navigatenthe wind highways.,For example, if I had to returnnto Berlin from Vancouver,,the first thing I would need to donis choose an altitude.,At different altitudes,nthere are different directions,and different speeds.,The red line is tomorrownand the orange, the day after tomorrow.,And there it goes.,You can see, the best daynto fly back to Berlin --,so now, traveling using only wind --,is in six days.,And we can get to 105 milesnfrom the center of Berlin,without burning a single drop of fuel,,being transported only by wind currents. 
 So we thought that these trajectoriesnthat we drew with the wind,could become signatures, declaringn"Independence from Fossil Fuels Day.",More and more of usnare experiencing the air,in a different way.,You're all familiar with Earth Day.,We think we should also celebrate Air Day:,it's a pact that we make with the earth,,an ethical commitment to the atmosphere.,But let's keep thinking and dreaming. 
 We've learned that the biggernthe sculptures are,,the more weight they can lift.,Remember,,they rise up only with hot airnthat's been heated by the sun.,Using this approach, we can learnnto build gardens in the air.,Could we one day live in a gardennthe size of the earth?,Could we live in an ecosystemnfloating among the clouds?,Answering these questionsnisn't just a technological challenge;,it's a way to reexaminenthe freedom of movement between countries,,and of overcoming the political,nsocial, cultural and military restrictions,of contemporary societies.,Because in the end,,the air belongs to everybody,and doesn't answer to any government. 
 (Applause) 
 And like we said earlier,,our imagination is the forcenthat allows us to create these places. 
 This is an installation I did,at the Metropolitan Museumnof Art in New York.,It asks the question:,What might these transnationalnspaces be like?,And once we inhabit those spaces,nwe need to learn how to move within them,,to walk among the clouds,,where every movement affectsneveryone else's movements;,the body weight and proximitynbetween people,will cause the space to expand ...,or contract.,There we are, suspendedn72 feet in the air.,When two or more peoplenget too close together,,even those farthest away are affected --,everyone falls to the same spot.,These are fragile ecosystems.,And it's between these spheresnthat we build nets that connect us.,There are momentsnwhen we have to face the void,,and fear can paralyze us.,One of the most beautiful thingsnabout this exhibit,is the sense of solidarity generated,when we face these new "aero-graphs." 
 Finally,,let me tell you one last story.,On July 16, 1945,,on the White Sands of New Mexico,,an atomic bomb was detonatednfor the first time.,As a result of this explosion,,a cloud of radioactive particlesndisseminated all over the earth,,marking the beginningnof the Anthropocene era.,Seventy years later, on November 8, 2015,,in the same place,,another event occurred.,For the first time in history,,we lifted a person into the airnusing only the sun,,without burning any fossil fuels.,As the sun rose up above the horizon,,we rose up, too,,silently,,slowly,,with no explosions.,We felt as if gravity had been inverted;,it wasn't pulling usntoward the center of the earth,,but toward the universe.,If Neil Armstrong said,nwhen he walked on the moon,,"That's one small step for man,,one giant leap for mankind,",perhaps what we ought to ask ourselves is:,What steps do we need to take today? 
 In the Aerocene era,,our steps are much smaller,nbut radically different;,they're steps that began with a bagnfull of air and wishes,,but that can carry usnto independence from fossil fuels,and the opportunity to celebrate Air Day;,steps that won't leave footprintsnon other planets,until we've learned to walknin the atmosphere of this one.,The landscapes are tiny,and the steps are tiny,,but I hope we can take them together.,And I'm sure that these steps will lead usnmuch further than the moon,,so we can learn to floatnwith our feet on the ground. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I want you to imagine,walking into a room,,a control room with a bunch of people,,a hundred people, hunchednover a desk with little dials,,and that that control room,will shape the thoughts and feelings,of a billion people.,This might sound like science fiction,,but this actually exists,right now, today. 
 I know because I used to benin one of those control rooms.,I was a design ethicist at Google,,where I studied how do you ethicallynsteer people's thoughts?,Because what we don't talk aboutnis how the handful of people,working at a handfulnof technology companies,through their choices will steernwhat a billion people are thinking today.,Because when you pull out your phone,and they design how this worksnor what's on the feed,,it's scheduling little blocksnof time in our minds.,If you see a notification,nit schedules you to have thoughts,that maybe you didn't intend to have.,If you swipe over that notification,,it schedules you into spendingna little bit of time,getting sucked into something,that maybe you didn't intendnto get sucked into.,When we talk about technology,,we tend to talk about itnas this blue sky opportunity.,It could go any direction.,And I want to get serious for a moment,and tell you why it's goingnin a very specific direction.,Because it's not evolving randomly.,There's a hidden goalndriving the direction,of all of the technology we make,,and that goal is the racenfor our attention.,Because every new site --,TED, elections, politicians,,games, even meditation apps --,have to compete for one thing,,which is our attention,,and there's only so much of it.,And the best way to get people's attention,is to know how someone's mind works.,And there's a whole bunchnof persuasive techniques,that I learned in college at a labncalled the Persuasive Technology Lab,to get people's attention. 
 A simple example is YouTube.,YouTube wants to maximizenhow much time you spend.,And so what do they do?,They autoplay the next video.,And let's say that works really well.,They're getting a little bitnmore of people's time.,Well, if you're Netflix,nyou look at that and say,,well, that's shrinking my market share,,so I'm going to autoplay the next episode.,But then if you're Facebook,,you say, that's shrinkingnall of my market share,,so now I have to autoplaynall the videos in the newsfeed,before waiting for you to click play.,So the internet is not evolving at random.,The reason it feelsnlike it's sucking us in the way it is,is because of this race for attention.,We know where this is going.,Technology is not neutral,,and it becomes this racento the bottom of the brain stem,of who can go lower to get it. 
 Let me give you an example of Snapchat.,If you didn't know,nSnapchat is the number one way,that teenagers innthe United States communicate.,So if you're like me, and you usentext messages to communicate,,Snapchat is that for teenagers,,and there's, like,na hundred million of them that use it.,And they inventedna feature called Snapstreaks,,which shows the number of days in a row,that two people havencommunicated with each other.,In other words, what they just did,is they gave two peoplensomething they don't want to lose.,Because if you're a teenager,nand you have 150 days in a row,,you don't want that to go away.,And so think of the little blocks of timenthat that schedules in kids' minds.,This isn't theoretical:nwhen kids go on vacation,,it's been shown they give their passwordsnto up to five other friends,to keep their Snapstreaks going,,even when they can't do it.,And they have, like, 30 of these things,,and so they have to get throughntaking photos of just pictures or walls,or ceilings just to get through their day.,So it's not even likenthey're having real conversations.,We have a temptation to think about this,as, oh, they're just using Snapchat,the way we used tongossip on the telephone.,It's probably OK.,Well, what this missesnis that in the 1970s,,when you were justngossiping on the telephone,,there wasn't a hundred engineersnon the other side of the screen,who knew exactlynhow your psychology worked,and orchestrated youninto a double bind with each other. 
 Now, if this is making younfeel a little bit of outrage,,notice that that thoughtnjust comes over you.,Outrage is a really good way alsonof getting your attention,,because we don't choose outrage.,It happens to us.,And if you're the Facebook newsfeed,,whether you'd want to or not,,you actually benefit when there's outrage.,Because outragendoesn't just schedule a reaction,in emotional time, space, for you.,We want to share that outragenwith other people.,So we want to hit share and say,,"Can you believe the thingnthat they said?",And so outrage works really wellnat getting attention,,such that if Facebook had a choicenbetween showing you the outrage feed,and a calm newsfeed,,they would wantnto show you the outrage feed,,not because someonenconsciously chose that,,but because that worked betternat getting your attention.,And the newsfeed control roomnis not accountable to us.,It's only accountablento maximizing attention.,It's also accountable,,because of the business modelnof advertising,,for anybody who can pay the mostnto actually walk into the control room,and say, "That group over there,,I want to schedule these thoughtsninto their minds.",So you can target,,you can precisely target a lie,directly to the peoplenwho are most susceptible.,And because this is profitable,nit's only going to get worse. 
 So I'm here today,because the costs are so obvious.,I don't know a more urgentnproblem than this,,because this problemnis underneath all other problems.,It's not just taking away our agency,to spend our attentionnand live the lives that we want,,it's changing the waynthat we have our conversations,,it's changing our democracy,,and it's changing our abilitynto have the conversations,and relationships we want with each other.,And it affects everyone,,because a billion peoplenhave one of these in their pocket. 
 So how do we fix this?,We need to make three radical changes,to technology and to our society.,The first is we need to acknowledgenthat we are persuadable.,Once you start understanding,that your mind can be scheduledninto having little thoughts,or little blocks of timenthat you didn't choose,,wouldn't we want to use that understanding,and protect against the waynthat that happens?,I think we need to see ourselvesnfundamentally in a new way.,It's almost like a new periodnof human history,,like the Enlightenment,,but almost a kind ofnself-aware Enlightenment,,that we can be persuaded,,and there might be somethingnwe want to protect.,The second is we need new modelsnand accountability systems,so that as the world gets betternand more and more persuasive over time --,because it's only goingnto get more persuasive --,that the people in those control rooms,are accountable and transparentnto what we want.,The only form of ethicalnpersuasion that exists,is when the goals of the persuader,are aligned with the goalsnof the persuadee.,And that involves questioning big things,nlike the business model of advertising.,Lastly,,we need a design renaissance,,because once you haventhis view of human nature,,that you can steer the timelinesnof a billion people --,just imagine, there's peoplenwho have some desire,about what they want to donand what they want to be thinking,and what they want to be feelingnand how they want to be informed,,and we're all just tuggedninto these other directions.,And you have a billion people just tuggedninto all these different directions.,Well, imagine an entire design renaissance,that tried to orchestratenthe exact and most empowering,time-well-spent waynfor those timelines to happen.,And that would involve two things:,one would be protectingnagainst the timelines,that we don't want to be experiencing,,the thoughts that wenwouldn't want to be happening,,so that when that ding happens,nnot having the ding that sends us away;,and the second would be empowering usnto live out the timeline that we want. 
 So let me give you a concrete example.,Today, let's say your friendncancels dinner on you,,and you are feeling a little bit lonely.,And so what do you do in that moment?,You open up Facebook.,And in that moment,,the designers in the control roomnwant to schedule exactly one thing,,which is to maximize how much timenyou spend on the screen.,Now, instead, imagine if those designersncreated a different timeline,that was the easiest way,nusing all of their data,,to actually help you get outnwith the people that you care about?,Just think, alleviatingnall loneliness in society,,if that was the timeline that Facebooknwanted to make possible for people.,Or imagine a different conversation.,Let's say you wanted to postnsomething supercontroversial on Facebook,,which is a really importantnthing to be able to do,,to talk about controversial topics.,And right now, when there'snthat big comment box,,it's almost asking you,nwhat key do you want to type?,In other words, it's schedulingna little timeline of things,you're going to continuento do on the screen.,And imagine instead that there wasnanother button there saying,,what would be mostntime well spent for you?,And you click "host a dinner.",And right therenunderneath the item it said,,"Who wants to RSVP for the dinner?",And so you'd still have a conversationnabout something controversial,,but you'd be having it in the mostnempowering place on your timeline,,which would be at home that nightnwith a bunch of a friends over,to talk about it.,So imagine we're running, like,na find and replace,on all of the timelinesnthat are currently steering us,towards more and morenscreen time persuasively,and replacing all of those timelines,with what do we want in our lives. 
 It doesn't have to be this way.,Instead of handicapping our attention,,imagine if we used all of this datanand all of this power,and this new view of human nature,to give us a superhuman ability to focus,and a superhuman ability to putnour attention to what we cared about,and a superhuman abilitynto have the conversations,that we need to have for democracy.,The most complex challenges in the world,require not just usnto use our attention individually.,They require us to use our attentionnand coordinate it together.,Climate change is going to requirenthat a lot of people,are being ablento coordinate their attention,in the most empowering way together.,And imagine creatingna superhuman ability to do that. 
 Sometimes the world'snmost pressing and important problems,are not these hypothetical future thingsnthat we could create in the future.,Sometimes the most pressing problems,are the ones that arenright underneath our noses,,the things that are already directingna billion people's thoughts.,And maybe instead of getting excitednabout the new augmented reality,and virtual realitynand these cool things that could happen,,which are going to be susceptiblento the same race for attention,,if we could fix the race for attention,on the thing that's alreadynin a billion people's pockets.,Maybe instead of getting excited,about the most excitingnnew cool fancy education apps,,we could fix the waynkids' minds are getting manipulated,into sending empty messagesnback and forth. 
 (Applause) 
 Maybe instead of worrying,about hypothetical futurenrunaway artificial intelligences,that are maximizing for one goal,,we could solve the runawaynartificial intelligence,that already exists right now,,which are these newsfeedsnmaximizing for one thing.,It's almost like instead of running awaynto colonize new planets,,we could fix the onenthat we're already on. 
 (Applause) 
 Solving this problem,is critical infrastructurenfor solving every other problem.,There's nothing in your lifenor in our collective problems,that does not require our abilitynto put our attention where we care about.,At the end of our lives,,all we have is our attention and our time.,What will be time well spent for ours? 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Chris Anderson: Tristan, thank you.nHey, stay up here a sec.,First of all, thank you.,I know we asked you to do this talknon pretty short notice,,and you've had quite a stressful week,getting this thing together, so thank you.,Some people listening might say,nwhat you complain about is addiction,,and all these people doing this stuff,nfor them it's actually interesting.,All these design decisions,have built user contentnthat is fantastically interesting.,The world's more interestingnthan it ever has been.,What's wrong with that? 
 Tristan Harris:nI think it's really interesting.,One way to see thisnis if you're just YouTube, for example,,you want to always shownthe more interesting next video.,You want to get better and betternat suggesting that next video,,but even if you could proposenthe perfect next video,that everyone would want to watch,,it would just be better and betternat keeping you hooked on the screen.,So what's missing in that equation,is figuring out whatnour boundaries would be.,You would want YouTube to knownsomething about, say, falling asleep.,The CEO of Netflix recently said,,"our biggest competitorsnare Facebook, YouTube and sleep.",And so what we need to recognizenis that the human architecture is limited,and that we have certain boundariesnor dimensions of our lives,that we want to be honored and respected,,and technology could help do that. 
 (Applause) 
 CA: I mean, could you make the case,that part of the problem here is thatnwe've got a naïve model of human nature?,So much of this is justifiednin terms of human preference,,where we've got these algorithmsnthat do an amazing job,of optimizing for human preference,,but which preference?,There's the preferencesnof things that we really care about,when we think about them,versus the preferencesnof what we just instinctively click on.,If we could implant that more nuancednview of human nature in every design,,would that be a step forward? 
 TH: Absolutely. I mean, I think right now,it's as if all of our technologynis basically only asking our lizard brain,what's the best waynto just impulsively get you to do,the next tiniest thing with your time,,instead of asking you in your life,what we would be mostntime well spent for you?,What would be the perfect timelinenthat might include something later,,would be time well spent for younhere at TED in your last day here? 
 CA: So if Facebook and Googlenand everyone said to us first up,,"Hey, would you like usnto optimize for your reflective brain,or your lizard brain? You choose." 
 TH: Right. That would be one way. Yes. 
 CA: You said persuadability,nthat's an interesting word to me,because to me there'sntwo different types of persuadability.,There's the persuadabilitynthat we're trying right now,of reason and thinkingnand making an argument,,but I think you're almostntalking about a different kind,,a more visceral type of persuadability,,of being persuaded withoutneven knowing that you're thinking. 
 TH: Exactly. The reasonnI care about this problem so much is,I studied at a lab callednthe Persuasive Technology Lab at Stanford,that taught [students how to recognize]nexactly these techniques.,There's conferences and workshopsnthat teach people all these covert ways,of getting people's attentionnand orchestrating people's lives.,And it's because most peoplendon't know that that exists,that this conversation is so important. 
 CA: Tristan, you and I, we both knownso many people from all these companies.,There are actually many here in the room,,and I don't know about you,nbut my experience of them,is that there isnno shortage of good intent.,People want a better world.,They are actually -- they really want it.,And I don't think anything you're sayingnis that these are evil people.,It's a system where there'snthese unintended consequences,that have really got out of control -- 
 TH: Of this race for attention.,It's the classic race to the bottomnwhen you have to get attention,,and it's so tense.,The only way to get morenis to go lower on the brain stem,,to go lower into outrage,nto go lower into emotion,,to go lower into the lizard brain. 
 CA: Well, thank you so much for helping usnall get a little bit wiser about this. 
 Tristan Harris, thank you.nTH: Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)I'm often asked,why I do art,,what do I want to saynwith my art photography,,and what is the use of it?,Once in a while I start to worry,how to actually measurenthe impact from the art,like we do with medicine or technology,,where we can see the resultsnand calculate it.,Then I would finally be ablento explain to my mother my art,with real numbers.,But my art is so far from metrics,,and moreover, my photographynis widely exposing the theme of escapism. 
 My theory is that all of us,struggle sometimes to escape,in order to analyze our reality,,appreciate it or change.,I don't work with daily life as it is,,and I'm not a documentary photographer,in the common sense.,But I am a documentary photographer,in a different sense.,I document dreams.,I work with daily life as it could be,,as I imagine it.,I am a daydreamer, but at the same timenI love things that are authentic,and deal with our innermost nature,,which I would never want to escape from.,I adore complicated personalities,,and real life inspires mento create my images.,Real life inspires our escape,,and sometimes that escape is very needed. 
 I believe heroes are not created easily,,and I choose to work with individuals,who are survivors,and facing everyday routines,that are not always full of color,,people who are on their waynto a better life,,fighting against life circumstances. 
 Why do I choose peoplenlike that for my models?,Because I've been in that position myself,,when I had to learnnhow to survive in real life.,I was a student living abroad in London.,I was working at two placesnat the same time as a waitress.,Obviously that wasn't my dream job,,but I decided to play a game,where I imaginednthat I am taking a role in a film,,and in the film I am a waitress,,and I need to act great.,I used to dye my hairnand brows to gingerette,,I changed my hair to curly perm,,I lost weight,and made myself believe,I am just a character acting in a film.,That isn't forever,,that is all just temporary.,That helped me a lot.,It motivated me to change my life,and take a hard time as a game.,Now, as an artist,,I am creating differentnlives for my models,in order to give them the experiencenof being someone else in reality.,Through the photographic process,,all of my modelsnbecome like silent movie actors.,They are captured at the moment,when they believenin being someone else entirely. 
 In order to createna new reality in its entirety,,I physically createnevery single thing in my work,,sometimes from outfits to the stage.,Because I work with analogues,,and I don't make any digitalnmanipulations to my photographs,,I need everythingnto take place in reality,,in spite of the fact that nowadays,,digitally, you can createnpretty much everything.,I don't like this path.,Even if that reaches perfection,,I see the beautynin authenticity of making,,and that's impossible without flaws.,A digitally manipulated photograph,is not true for me.,It doesn't capture anything real.,It's not experienced, not motivating.,It's like, instead of going traveling,,you look at someone else'sntravel photographs. 
 What I find so exciting,is the ability to make people's dreamsnof being someone else a reality.,That's like a drug,which pushes me to keep working,,even without metrics. 
 One of my models,had always dreamednof being seen as a warrior,,but she wasn't able to do sportsnbecause of her health problems.,Half a year ago, she passed away,from heart disease at the age of 22.,But two days before her death,,the images we spent monthsnworking on together,of her as a warriornshe dreamed of becoming,were published at a large exhibitionnin Milan by Vogue Magazine.,All her life was about overcoming.,Before she died, she had known,that thousands of peoplensaw her image from the land of escapism,and believed in hernas a brave and fearless warrior. 
 For my work, I invite peoplento play a game,like we all used to as children,when we pretend to be someone else,and that process made us really happy.,To my mind it is important for grown-ups.,We need these transformations,to enact this in the name of art.,It gives us the very real feelingnof being important and powerful,in order to influence our reality.,I know this fromnmy own personal experience.,I have had so many versions of myself,through my self-portraits,that I've been many different characters. 
 Being someone else in the land of escapism,doesn't exactly give us numbersnthat we can gauge,,but it's like a real lost form of magic,which exists but can't be measured.,There is a unique power in art,to transform and lift our limits.,Art creates what I call a conjured life,,which helps our existence,and pushes, motivatesnand inspires us to dwell,and express ourselves,without metrics or calculations. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So, my mother's a pediatrician,,and when I was young,nshe'd tell the craziest stories,that combined sciencenwith her overactive imagination.,One of the stories she toldnwas that if you eat a lot of salt,,all of the blood rushes up your legs,,through your body,,and shoots out the top of your head,,killing you instantly. 
 (Laughter) 
 She called it "high blood pressure." 
 (Laughter) 
 This was my first experiencenwith science fiction,,and I loved it.,So when I started to writenmy own science fiction and fantasy,,I was surprised that itnwas considered un-African.,So naturally, I asked, what is African?,And this is what I know so far:,Africa is important.,Africa is the future.,It is, though.,And Africa is a serious placenwhere only serious things happen. 
 So when I present my work somewhere,nsomeone will always ask,,"What's so important about it?,How does it deal with real African issues,like war, poverty, devastation or AIDS?",And it doesn't.,My work is about Nairobi pop bandsnthat want to go to space,or about seven-foot-tall robots,that fall in love.,It's nothing incredibly important.,It's just fun, fierce and frivolous,,as frivolous as bubble gum --,"AfroBubbleGum." 
 So I'm not saying thatnagenda art isn't important;,I'm the chairperson of a charity,that deals with films and theatersnthat write about HIV and radicalization,and female genital mutilation.,It's vital and important art,,but it cannot be the only artnthat comes out of the continent.,We have to tell more stories,that are vibrant.,The danger of the single storynis still being realized.,And maybe it's because of the funding.,A lot of art is still dependentnon developmental aid.,So art becomes a tool for agenda.,Or maybe it's because we've only seennone image of ourselves for so long,that that's all we know how to create.,Whatever the reason, we need a new way,,and AfroBubbleGum is one approach.,It's the advocacy of art for art's sake.,It's the advocacy of artnthat is not policy-driven,or agenda-driven,or based on education,,just for the sake of imagination:,AfroBubbleGum art. 
 And we can't all be AfroBubbleGumists.,We have to judge our worknfor its potential poverty porn pitfalls.,We have to have testsnthat are similar to the Bechdel test,,and ask questions like:,Are two or more Africansnin this piece of fiction healthy?,Are those same Africans financially stablenand not in need of saving?,Are they having fun and enjoying life?,And if we can answer yesnto two or more of these questions,,then surely we're AfroBubbleGumists. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 And fun is political,,because imagine if we havenimages of Africans who were vibrant,and loving and thriving,and living a beautiful, vibrant life.,What would we think of ourselves then?,Would we think that maybenwe're worthy of more happiness?,Would we think of our shared humanitynthrough our shared joy?,I think of these things when I create.,I think of the people and the placesnthat give me immeasurable joy,,and I work to represent them.,And that's why I write stories,about futuristic girls that riskneverything to save plants,or to race camels,or even just to dance,,to honor fun,,because my world is mostly happy. 
 And I know happiness is a privilegenin this current splintered world,where remaining hopefulnrequires diligence.,But maybe, if you join menin creating, curating and commissioning,more AfroBubbleGum art,,there might be hopenfor a different view of the world,,a happy Africa view,where children are strangely traumatized,by their mother's dark sense of humor, 
 (Laughter) 
 but also they're claiming fun,nfierce and frivolous art,in the name of all thingsnunseriously African.,Because we're AfroBubbleGumists,and there's so many more of usnthan you can imagine. 
 Thank you so much. 
 (Applause)[His Holiness Pope FrancisnFilmed in Vatican City,First shown at TED2017] 
 Good evening – or, good morning,nI am not sure what time it is there.,Regardless of the hour, I am thrillednto be participating in your conference.,I very much like its titlen– "The Future You" –,because, while looking at tomorrow,nit invites us to open a dialogue today,,to look at the future through a "you.","The Future You:",the future is made of yous,nit is made of encounters,,because life flowsnthrough our relations with others.,Quite a few years of life,have strengthened my conviction,that each and everyone's existencenis deeply tied to that of others:,life is not time merely passing by,nlife is about interactions. 
 As I meet, or lend an earnto those who are sick,,to the migrantsnwho face terrible hardships,in search of a brighter future,,to prison inmates who carryna hell of pain inside their hearts,,and to those, many of them young,nwho cannot find a job,,I often find myself wondering:,"Why them and not me?",I, myself, was bornnin a family of migrants;,my father, my grandparents,nlike many other Italians,,left for Argentina,and met the fate of thosenwho are left with nothing.,I could have very well ended upnamong today's "discarded" people.,And that's why I always ask myself,ndeep in my heart:,"Why them and not me?" 
 First and foremost, I would love itnif this meeting could help to remind us,that we all need each other,,none of us is an island,,an autonomous and independent "I,"nseparated from the other,,and we can only build the futurenby standing together, including everyone.,We don’t think about it often,nbut everything is connected,,and we need to restorenour connections to a healthy state.,Even the harsh judgment I hold in my heart,against my brother or my sister,,the open wound that was never cured,nthe offense that was never forgiven,,the rancor that is only going to hurt me,,are all instances of a fightnthat I carry within me,,a flare deep in my heartnthat needs to be extinguished,before it goes up in flames,nleaving only ashes behind. 
 Many of us, nowadays,,seem to believe that a happy futurenis something impossible to achieve.,While such concernsnmust be taken very seriously,,they are not invincible.,They can be overcome when we don't locknour door to the outside world.,Happiness can only be discovered,as a gift of harmony between the wholenand each single component.,Even science – and you know itnbetter than I do –,points to an understanding of reality,as a place where every element connectsnand interacts with everything else. 
 And this brings me to my second message.,How wonderful would it be,if the growth of scientificnand technological innovation,would come along with more equalitynand social inclusion.,How wonderful would it be,nwhile we discover faraway planets,,to rediscover the needs of the brothersnand sisters orbiting around us.,How wonderful would it be if solidarity,,this beautiful and, at times,ninconvenient word,,were not simply reduced to social work,,and became, instead, the default attitude,in political, economicnand scientific choices,,as well as in the relationshipsnamong individuals, peoples and countries.,Only by educating peoplento a true solidarity,will we be able to overcome,the "culture of waste,",which doesn't concern only food and goods,but, first and foremost, the people,who are cast asidenby our techno-economic systems,which, without even realizing it,,are now putting productsnat their core, instead of people. 
 Solidarity is a term that many wishnto erase from the dictionary.,Solidarity, however,nis not an automatic mechanism.,It cannot be programmed or controlled.,It is a free response bornnfrom the heart of each and everyone.,Yes, a free response!,When one realizes,that life, even in the middlenof so many contradictions, is a gift,,that love is the sourcenand the meaning of life,,how can they withhold their urgento do good to another fellow being? 
 In order to do good,,we need memory, we need couragenand we need creativity.,And I know that TEDngathers many creative minds.,Yes, love does requirena creative, concrete,and ingenious attitude.,Good intentions and conventional formulas,,so often used to appeasenour conscience, are not enough.,Let us help each other,nall together, to remember,that the other is notna statistic or a number.,The other has a face.,The "you" is always a real presence,,a person to take care of. 
 There is a parable Jesus toldnto help us understand the difference,between those who'd rather not be botherednand those who take care of the other.,I am sure you have heard it before.nIt is the Parable of the Good Samaritan.,When Jesus was asked:n"Who is my neighbor?" -,namely, "Who should I take care of?" -,he told this story, the story of a man,who had been assaulted, robbed,nbeaten and abandoned along a dirt road.,Upon seeing him, a priest and a Levite,ntwo very influential people of the time,,walked past him without stopping to help.,After a while, a Samaritan, a very muchndespised ethnicity at the time, walked by.,Seeing the injured mannlying on the ground,,he did not ignore himnas if he weren't even there.,Instead, he felt compassion for this man,,which compelled him to actnin a very concrete manner.,He poured oil and winenon the wounds of the helpless man,,brought him to a hostel,and paid out of his pocketnfor him to be assisted. 
 The story of the Good Samaritannis the story of today’s humanity.,People's paths are riddled with suffering,,as everything is centered around money,nand things, instead of people.,And often there is this habit, by peoplenwho call themselves "respectable,",of not taking care of the others,,thus leaving behind thousandsnof human beings, or entire populations,,on the side of the road.,Fortunately, there are also thosenwho are creating a new world,by taking care of the other,neven out of their own pockets.,Mother Teresa actually said:,"One cannot love,nunless it is at their own expense." 
 We have so much to do,nand we must do it together.,But how can we do thatnwith all the evil we breathe every day?,Thank God,,no system can nullify our desirento open up to the good,,to compassion and to our capacitynto react against evil,,all of which stemnfrom deep within our hearts.,Now you might tell me,,"Sure, these are beautiful words,,but I am not the Good Samaritan,nnor Mother Teresa of Calcutta.",On the contrary: we are precious,neach and every one of us.,Each and every one of usnis irreplaceable in the eyes of God.,Through the darkness of today's conflicts,,each and every one of usncan become a bright candle,,a reminder that lightnwill overcome darkness,,and never the other way around. 
 To Christians,nthe future does have a name,,and its name is Hope.,Feeling hopeful does not meannto be optimistically naïve,and ignore the tragedy humanity is facing.,Hope is the virtue of a heart,that doesn't lock itself into darkness,nthat doesn't dwell on the past,,does not simply get by in the present,nbut is able to see a tomorrow.,Hope is the doornthat opens onto the future.,Hope is a humble, hidden seed of life,that, with time,nwill develop into a large tree.,It is like some invisible yeastnthat allows the whole dough to grow,,that brings flavor to all aspects of life.,And it can do so much,,because a tiny flicker of lightnthat feeds on hope,is enough to shatternthe shield of darkness.,A single individualnis enough for hope to exist,,and that individual can be you.,And then there will be another "you,"nand another "you,",and it turns into an "us.",And so, does hope beginnwhen we have an "us?",No.,Hope began with one "you.",When there is an "us,"nthere begins a revolution. 
 The third messagenI would like to share today,is, indeed, about revolution:nthe revolution of tenderness.,And what is tenderness?,It is the love that comes closenand becomes real.,It is a movementnthat starts from our heart,and reaches the eyes,nthe ears and the hands.,Tenderness means to usenour eyes to see the other,,our ears to hear the other,,to listen to the children, the poor,nthose who are afraid of the future.,To listen also to the silent crynof our common home,,of our sick and polluted earth.,Tenderness means to usenour hands and our heart,to comfort the other,,to take care of those in need. 
 Tenderness is the languagenof the young children,,of those who need the other.,A child’s love for mom and dad,grows through their touch, their gaze,ntheir voice, their tenderness.,I like when I hear parents,talk to their babies,nadapting to the little child,,sharing the same level of communication.,This is tenderness:nbeing on the same level as the other.,God himself descended into Jesusnto be on our level.,This is the same pathnthe Good Samaritan took.,This is the path that Jesus himself took.,He lowered himself,,he lived his entire human existence,practicing the real,nconcrete language of love. 
 Yes, tenderness is the path of choice,for the strongest,nmost courageous men and women.,Tenderness is not weakness;nit is fortitude.,It is the path of solidarity,nthe path of humility.,Please, allow me to say it loud and clear:,the more powerful you are,,the more your actionsnwill have an impact on people,,the more responsible you arento act humbly.,If you don’t, your power will ruin you,nand you will ruin the other.,There is a saying in Argentina:,"Power is like drinking ginnon an empty stomach.",You feel dizzy, you get drunk,nyou lose your balance,,and you will end up hurting yourselfnand those around you,,if you don’t connect your powernwith humility and tenderness.,Through humility and concrete love,non the other hand,,power – the highest, the strongest one –nbecomes a service, a force for good. 
 The future of humankind isn't exclusivelynin the hands of politicians,,of great leaders, of big companies.,Yes, they do holdnan enormous responsibility.,But the future is, most of all,nin the hands of those people,who recognize the other as a "you",and themselves as part of an "us.",We all need each other.,And so, please, think of menas well with tenderness,,so that I can fulfill the tasknI have been given,for the good of the other,,of each and every one, of all of you,,of all of us.,Thank you.So, I teach college studentsnabout inequality and race in education,,and I like to leave my office opennto any of my students,who might just want to see me to chat.,And a few semesters ago,,one of my more cheerfulnstudents, Mahari,,actually came to see me,and mentioned that he was feelingna bit like an outcast because he's black.,He had just transferred to NYUnfrom a community college,on a merit scholarship,,and turns out,,only about five percentnof students at NYU are black.,And so I started to remember,that I know that feelingnof being an outsider,in your own community.,It's partially what drew me to my work. 
 At my university,,I'm one of the fewnfaculty members of color,,and growing up, I experiencednmy family's social mobility,,moving out of apartmentsninto a nice house,,but in an overwhelminglynwhite neighborhood.,I was 12,,and kids would say that were surprisednthat I didn't smell like curry. 
 (Laughter) 
 That's because school is in the morning,,and I had Eggo waffles for breakfast. 
 (Laughter) 
 Curry is for dinner. 
 (Laughter) 
 So when Mahari was leaving,,I asked him how he was copingnwith feeling isolated.,And he said that despite feeling lonely,,he just threw himself at his work,,that he built strategies around his grit,and his desire to be successful.,A mentor of mine is actuallynDr. Angela Duckworth,,the psychologist at UPenn who has definednthis stick-to-itiveness of grit,as being "the perseverancenand passion for long-term goals.",Angela's book has become a bestseller,,and schools across the country,,particularly charter schools,,have become interested in citingn"grit" as a core value.,But sometimes grit isn't enough,,especially in education.,So when Mahari was leaving my office,,I worried that he might neednsomething more specific,to combat the challengesnthat he mentioned to me. 
 As a sociologist,nI also study achievement,,but from a slightly different perspective.,I research students who have overcomenimmense obstacles,related to their background.,Students from low-income,,often single-parent households,,students who have been homeless,nincarcerated or perhaps undocumented,,or some who have strugglednwith substance abuse,or lived through violent or sexual trauma. 
 So let me tell you about twonof the grittiest people I've met.,Tyrique was raised by a single mother,,and then after high school,nhe fell in with the wrong crowd.,He got arrested for armed robbery.,But in prison, he started to work hard.,He took college credit courses,,so when he got out,nhe was able to get a master's,,and today he's a manager at a nonprofit.,Vanessa had to move around a lot as a kid,,from the Lower East Sidento Staten Island to the Bronx.,She was raised primarilynby her extended family,,because her own mothernhad a heroin addiction.,Yet at 15,,Vanessa had to drop out of school,,and she had a son of her own.,But eventually, she was ablento go to community college,,get her associate's,,then go to an elite collegento finish her bachelor's. 
 So some people mightnhear these stories and say,,"Yes, those two definitely have grit.,They basically pulled themselves upnby the bootstraps.",But that's an incomplete picture,,because what's more important,is that they had factors in their livesnthat helped to influence their agency,,or their specific capacity,to actually overcomenthe obstacles that they were facing,and navigate the systemngiven their circumstances. 
 So, allow me to elaborate.,In prison, Tyriquenwas actually aimless at first,,as a 22-year-old on Rikers Island.,This is until an older detaineentook him aside,and asked him to helpnwith the youth program.,And in mentoring youth,,he started to see his own mistakesnand possibilities in the teens.,This is what got him interestednin taking college-credit courses.,And when he got out,,he got a job with Fortune Society,,where many executives are peoplenwho have been formerly incarcerated.,So then he was able to getna master's in social work,,and today, he even lecturesnat Columbia about prison reform.,And Vanessa ...,well, after the birth of her son,,she happened to find a programncalled Vocational Foundation,that gave her 20 dollars biweekly,,a MetroCard,and her first experiences with a computer.,These simple resourcesnare what helped her get her GED,,but then she sufferednfrom a very serious kidney failure,,which was particularly problematicnbecause she was only born with one kidney.,She spent 10 years on dialysisnwaiting for a successful transplant.,After that,,her mentors at community collegenhad kept in touch with her,,and so she was able to go,,and they put her in an honors program.,And that's the pathwaynthat allowed her to become accepted,to one of the most elite collegesnfor women in the country,,and she received her bachelor's at 36,,setting an incredible examplenfor her young son. 
 What these stories primarily indicatenis that teaching is social,and benefits from social scaffolding.,There were factorsnpushing these two in one direction,,but through tailorednmentorship and opportunities,,they were able to reflectnon their circumstances,and resist negative influences.,They also learned simple skillsnlike developing a network,,or asking for help --,things many of us in this room can forgetnthat we have needed from time to time,,or can take for granted. 
 And when we think of people like this,,we should only think of themnas exceptional, but not as exceptions.,Thinking of them as exceptions absolves us,of the collective responsibilitynto help students in similar situations.,When Presidents Bush, Obamanand now even Trump,,have called educationn"the civil rights issue of our time,",perhaps we should treat it that way.,If schools were able to thinknabout the agency that their students have,and bring to the tablenwhen they push them,,what students learn can becomenmore relevant to their lives,,and then they can tap into those internalnreservoirs of grit and character. 
 So this here --,My student Mahari,got accepted to law schoolnwith scholarships,,and not to brag,,but I did write one of his lettersnof recommendation. 
 (Laughter) 
 And even though I know hard worknis what got him this achievement,,I've seen him findnhis voice along the way,,which as someone who's grown upna little bit shy and awkward,,I know it takes time and support.,So even thoughnhe will rely a lot on his grit,to get him throughnthat first-year law school grind,,I'll be there as a mentor for him,,check in with him from time to time,,maybe take him out to get some curry ... 
 (Laughter) 
 so that he can keep growing his agencynto succeed even more. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So, Ma was trying to explainnsomething to me,about Grandma and when they grew up,,but I couldn't pay attention to her,because I was five years old,nand I was petrified.,I had just seen The Green Lady.,Now, about a week earlier,nI'd watched that movie "Godzilla,",the one about that huge lizard-like beastnstorming a major city,,and the thought of a green monsterncoming for me was stuck in my mind.,And yet there I was,nat the tip of Lower Manhattan with my mom,,just staring at her:,her horns,,her muscles --,all of it just frightened me.,And I didn't knownwhether she was a monster or a hero.,So I decided to consultnthe Google of the day --,"Ma! Ma!" 
 (Laughter) 
 My mother explained that The Green Ladynis actually the Statue of Liberty,and that she was waving immigrants in.,Now, the part of her explanationnthat really messed with my young head,was the fact that, according to Ma,,long before us,,The Green Lady was actually brown,,brown like me,,and that she changedncolors over the years,,much like America.,Now, the part that reallynis intriguing about this,is that when she changed colors,,she made me think about myself.,It all made sense to me,,because as a first-generation American,,I was surrounded by immigrants.,In fact, within my immediate social circlenof the people who support me,,who enrich my life,,at least two are foreign-born.,My life as a US citizen is in many waysnshaped by newcomers,,and chances are,,so is yours. 
 There are more than 40 millionnimmigrants in the USA.,According to census data,,a quarter of the nation's childrennhave at least one foreign-born parent.,I know all these statisticsnbecause I study global migration patterns.,I'm a journalist,nand for the last few years,,I've been documentingnthe lives of US citizens,who've lost people to deportation.,And the numbers are enormous.,From 2008 to 2016,,more than three million peoplenwere "ordered removed" --,that's the technical termnfor being deported.,There is an economic, a political,na psychological and an emotional cost,to those deportations --,the moments when these circles are broken. 
 I once asked a US soldier,,"Why did you volunteer to fight this war?" 
 And she told me,,"Because I'm proud to defend my country." 
 But I pressed to know --,"Really, when you're on base,,and you hear bombsnexploding in the distance,,and you see soldiers coming backnwho are gravely injured,,in that moment,nwhen you know you could be next,,what does 'my country' mean?" 
 She looked at me.,"My country is my wife,,my family,,my friends, my soldiers.",What she was telling me,is that "my country" is a collectionnof these strong relationships;,these social circles. 
 When the social circles are weakened,,a country itself is weaker.,We're missing a crucial aspectnin the debate about immigration policy.,Rather than focusing on individuals,,we should focusnon the circles around them,,because these are the peoplenwho are left behind:,the voters, the taxpayers,,the ones who are suffering that loss.,And it's not just the childrennof the deported,who are impacted.,You have brothers and sistersnwho are separated by borders.,You have classmates, teachers,nlaw enforcement officers,,technologists, scientists, doctors,,who are all scramblingnto make sense of new realities,when their social circles are broken.,These are the real livesnbehind all these statistics,that dominate discussionsnabout immigration policy.,But we don't often think about them.,And I'm trying to change that. 
 Here's just one of the real-life storiesnthat I've collected.,And it still haunts me.,I met Ramon and his son in 2016,,the same year both of themnwere being ordered out of the country.,Ramon was being deported to Latin America,,while his son, who was a sergeantnin the US military,,was being deployed.,Deported ...,deployed.,If you just look at Ramon's case,,it wouldn't be clear how deeplynconnected to the country he is.,But consider his son:,a US citizen defending a countrynthat's banished his father.,The social circle is what's key here. 
 Here's another examplenthat illustrates those critical bonds.,A group of citizens in Philadelphianwere concerned about their jobs,,because the legal ownernof the restaurant where they worked,was an undocumented immigrant,,and immigration officialsnhad picked him up.,They rallied behind him.,An immigration lawyer argued,he was too importantnto the local community,to be deported.,At the hearing, they even submittednrestaurant reviews --,restaurant reviews!,In the end, a judge exercisednwhat's called "judicial discretion",and allowed him to stay in the country,,but only because they considerednthe social circle. 
 There are 23 millionnnoncitizens in the USA,,according to verifiable federal data.,And that doesn't include the undocumented,,because numbers for that populationnare at best complex estimates.,Let's just work with what we have.,That's 23 million social circles --,about 100 million individuals,whose lives could be impactednby deportation.,And the stress of it all is trickling downnthrough the population.,A 2017 poll by UCLA of LA County residents,found that 30 percentnof citizens in LA County,are stressed about deportation,,not because they themselvesncould be removed,,but rather, because membersnof their social circle were at risk. 
 I am not suggesting that no onenshould ever be deported;,don't confuse me with that.,But what I am saying is that we neednto look at the bigger picture.,If you are within the sound of my voice,,I want you to close your eyes for a moment,and examine your own social circle.,Who are your foreign-born?,What would it feel likenif the circle were broken? 
 Share your story.,I'm building a global archivenof first-person accounts,and linking them with mapping technology,,so that we can see exactlynwhere these circles break,,because this is notnjust an American issue.,There are a quarter-billion migrantsnaround the world;,people living, loving and learningnin countries where they were not born.,And in my career, in my life,nI've been one of them:,in China, in Africa, in Europe.,And each time I becomenone of these foreigners --,one of these strange-lookingnguys in a new land --,I can't help but think back to that day,when I was in Lower Manhattan with my mom,all those decades ago,,when I was scared,,and I had just spotted that green lady.,And I guess the questionnthat I keep on thinking about,when I see her,and all the younger replicas of hernthat are so obviously brown,,and even the paintingsnthat showcase her in the beginning,as not quite green --,when I look at all of that,,the question that my researchnseeks to answer,becomes, to me, the same onenthat confounded me all those years ago:,Is she a monster,or a hero? 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)What are you doing on this stage,in front of all these people? 
 (Laughter) 
 Run! 
 (Laughter) 
 Run now. 
 That's the voice of my anxiety talking.,Even when there's absolutelynnothing wrong,,I sometimes getnthis overwhelming sense of doom,,like danger is lurkingnjust around the corner. 
 You see, a few years ago,,I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety,and depression --,two conditions that often go hand in hand.,Now, there was a timenI wouldn't have told anybody,,especially not in front of a big audience.,As a black woman,,I've had to developnextraordinary resilience to succeed.,And like most people in my community,,I had the misconception that depressionnwas a sign of weakness,,a character flaw.,But I wasn't weak;,I was a high achiever.,I'd earned a Master's degreenin Media Studies,and had a string of high-profile jobsnin the film and television industries.,I'd even won two Emmy Awardsnfor my hard work.,Sure, I was totally spent,,I lacked interest in thingsnI used to enjoy,,barely ate,,struggled with insomnia,and felt isolated and depleted.,But depressed?,No, not me. 
 It took weeks before I could admit it,,but the doctor was right:,I was depressed.,Still, I didn't tell anybodynabout my diagnosis.,I was too ashamed.,I didn't think I had the rightnto be depressed.,I had a privileged life,with a loving familynand a successful career.,And when I thought aboutnthe unspeakable horrors,that my ancestorsnhad been through in this country,so that I could have it better,,my shame grew even deeper.,I was standing on their shoulders.,How could I let them down?,I would hold my head up,,put a smile on my face,and never tell a soul. 
 On July 4, 2013,,my world came crashing in on me.,That was the day I gotna phone call from my mom,telling me that my 22-year-old nephew,nPaul, had ended his life,,after years of battlingndepression and anxiety.,There are no words that can describenthe devastation I felt.,Paul and I were very close,,but I had no idea he was in so much pain.,Neither one of us had ever talkednto the other about our struggles.,The shame and stigma kept us both silent. 
 Now, my way of dealing with adversitynis to face it head on,,so I spent the next two yearsnresearching depression and anxiety,,and what I found was mind-blowing.,The World Health Organization reports,that depression is the leading causenof sickness and disability,in the world.,While the exact causenof depression isn't clear,,research suggestsnthat most mental disorders develop,,at least in part,,because of a chemicalnimbalance in the brain,,and/or an underlyingngenetic predisposition.,So you can't just shake it off. 
 For black Americans,,stressors like racismnand socioeconomic disparities,put them at a 20 percent greater risknof developing a mental disorder,,yet they seek mental health services,at about half the rate of white Americans.,One reason is the stigma,,with 63 percent of black Americansnmistaking depression for a weakness.,Sadly, the suicide ratenamong black children,has doubled in the past 20 years. 
 Now, here's the good news:,seventy percent of peoplenstruggling with depression will improve,with therapy, treatment and medication.,Armed with this information,,I made a decision:,I wasn't going to be silent anymore.,With my family's blessing,,I would share our story,in hopes of sparkingna national conversation. 
 A friend, Kelly Pierre-Louis, said,,"Being strong is killing us.",She's right.,We have got to retirenthose tired, old narratives,of the strong black woman,and the super-masculine black man,,who, no matter how many timesnthey get knocked down,,just shake it off and soldier on.,Having feelings isn't a sign of weakness.,Feelings mean we're human.,And when we deny our humanity,,it leaves us feeling empty inside,,searching for ways to self-medicatenin order to fill the void.,My drug was high achievement. 
 These days, I share my story openly,,and I ask others to share theirs, too.,I believe that's what it takes,to help people who maynbe suffering in silence,to know that they are not alone,and to know that with help,,they can heal.,Now, I still have my struggles,,particularly with the anxiety,,but I'm able to manage it,through daily mediation,nyoga and a relatively healthy diet. 
 (Laughter) 
 If I feel like thingsnare starting to spiral,,I make an appointment to see my therapist,,a dynamic black womannnamed Dawn Armstrong,,who has a great sense of humor,and a familiarity that I find comforting.,I will always regret,that I couldn't be there for my nephew.,But my sincerest hope,is that I can inspire othersnwith the lesson that I've learned. 
 Life is beautiful.,Sometimes it's messy,,and it's always unpredictable.,But it will all be OK,when you have your support systemnto help you through it.,I hope that if your burden gets too heavy,,you'll ask for a hand, too. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'd like to take you backnabout seven years in my life.,Friday afternoon,,a few days before Christmas 2009.,I was the director of operations,at a consumer products companynin San Francisco,,and I was called into a meetingnthat was already in progress.,That meeting turned outnto be my exit interview.,I was fired, along with several others.,I was 64 years old at the time.,It wasn't completely unexpected.,I signed a stack of papers,,gathered my personal effects,,and left to join my wife,who was waiting for menat a nearby restaurant,,completely unaware.,Fast-forward several hours,,we both got really silly drunk. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, 40 plus years of continuous employment,for a variety of companies,nlarge and small,,was over.,I had a good a network,na good reputation --,I thought I'd be just fine.,I was an engineernin manufacturing and packaging.,I had a good background.,Retirement was, like for so many people,,simply not an option for me.,So I turned to consultingnfor the next couple of years,without any passion whatsoever. 
 And then an idea began to take root,,born from my concern for our environment.,I wanted to build my own business,,designing and manufacturingnbiodegradable packaging from waste --,paper, agricultural, even textile waste --,replacing the toxic,ndisposable plastic packaging,to which we've all become addicted.,This is called clean technology,,and it felt really meaningful to me.,A venture that could help to reducenthe billions of pounds,of single-use plastic packagingndumped each year,and polluting our land,nour rivers and our oceans,,and left for futurengenerations to resolve --,our grandchildren,,my grandchildren. 
 And so now at the age of 66,,with 40 years of experience,,I became an entrepreneurnfor the very first time. 
 (Cheers) 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you.,But there's more. 
 (Laughter) 
 Lots of issues to deal with:,manufacturing, outsourcing, job creation,,patents, partnerships, funding --,these are all typicalnissues for a start-up,,but hardly typical for me.,And a word about funding.,I live and work in San Francisco.,And if you're looking for funding,,you are typically going to competenwith some very young people,from the high-tech industry,,and it can be very discouragingnand intimidating.,I have shoes oldernthan most of these people. 
 (Laughter) 
 I do. 
 (Laughter) 
 But five years later,,I'm thrilled and proud to share with you,that our revenues have doubled every year,,we have no debt,,we have several marquee clients,,our patent was issued,,I have a wonderful partner,who's been with menright from the beginning,,and we've won more than 20 awardsnfor the work that we've done.,But best of all,,we've made a small dent --,a very small dent --,in the worldwide plastic pollution crisis. 
 (Applause) 
 And I am doing the most rewardingnand meaningful work of my life right now.,I can tell you there's lots of resourcesnavailable to entrepreneurs of all ages,,but what I really yearned fornfive years ago,was to find other first-time entrepreneurs,who were my age.,I wanted to connect with them.,I had no role models, absolutely none.,That 20-something app developernfrom Silicon Valley,was not my role model. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm sure he was very clever -- 
 (Laughter) 
 I want to do something about that,,and I want all of usnto do something about that.,I want us to start talking more,about people who don't becomenentrepreneurs until they are seniors.,Talking about these boldnmen and women who are checking in,when their peers, in essence,nare checking out.,And then connecting all these peoplenacross industries, across regions,,across countries --,building a community. 
 You know, the Small BusinessnAdministration tells us,that 64 percent of new jobsncreated in the private sector in the USA,are thanks to small businesses like mine.,And who's to saynthat we'll stay forever small?,We have an interesting culture,that really expectsnwhen you reach a certain age,,you're going to be golfing,nor playing checkers,,or babysitting the grandkidsnall of the time.,And I adore my grandchildren -- 
 (Laughter) 
 and I'm also passionate,about doing something meaningfulnin the global marketplace. 
 And I'm going to have lots of company.,The Census Bureau says that by 2050,,there will be 84 million seniorsnin this country.,That's an amazing number.,That's almost twice as manynas we have today.,Can you imagine how manynfirst-time entrepreneurs there will be,among 84 million people?,And they'll all havenfour decades of experience. 
 (Laughter) 
 So when I say, "Let's start talking morenabout these wonderful entrepreneurs,",I mean, let's talk about their ventures,,just as we do the venturesnof their much younger counterparts.,The older entrepreneurs in this countrynhave a 70 percent success rate,starting new ventures.,70 percent success rate.,We're like the Golden State Warriorsnof entrepreneurs -- 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 And that number plummets to 28 percentnfor younger entrepreneurs.,This is according to a UK-basedngroup called CMI. 
 Aren't the accomplishmentsnof a 70-year-old entrepreneur,every bit as meaningful,,every bit as newsworthy,,as the accomplishmentsnof a 30-year-old entrepreneur?,Of course they are.,That's why I'd like to make the phrasen"70 over 70" just as -- 
 (Laughter) 
 just as commonplacenas the phrase "30 under 30." 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. 
 (Cheers) 
 (Applause)Caitlin Quattromani: The electionnof 2016 felt different.,Political conversationsnwith our family and friends,uncovered a level of polarization,that many of us had notnpreviously experienced.,People who we always thoughtnwere reasonable and intelligent,seemed like strangers.,We said to ourselves,n"How could you think that?,I thought you were smart." 
 Lauran Arledge: Caitlin and I metnin the summer of 2011,,and we bonded around being working moms,and trying to keepnour very energetic boys busy.,And we soon found outnwe had almost everything in common.,From our love of Coloradonto our love of sushi,,there wasn't much we didn't agree on.,We also discovered that we sharena deep love of this country,and feel a responsibilitynto be politically active.,But no one's perfect -- 
 (Laughter),and I soon found outntwo disappointing things about Caitlin.,First, she hates camping. 
 CQ: I think camping is the worst. 
 LA: So there would not benany joint camping trips in our future.,The second thing is thatnshe's politically active all right --,as a conservative. 
 CQ: I may hate camping,nbut I love politics.,I listen to conservative talk radionjust about every day,,and I've volunteered for a few differentnconservative political campaigns. 
 LA: And I'd say I'm a little to the left,,like all the way to the left. 
 (Laughter) 
 I've always been interested in politics.,I was a political science major,,and I worked as a community organizernand on a congressional campaign. 
 CQ: So as Lauran and Inwere getting to know each other,,it was right in the middlenof that 2012 presidential campaign,,and most of our earlynpolitical conversations,were really just basednin jokes and pranks.,So as an example, I would changenLauran's computer screen saver,to a picture of Mitt Romney,,or she would put an Obamancampaign magnet on the back of my car. 
 (Laughter) 
 LA: Car, not minivan. 
 CQ: But over time,nthose conversations grew more serious,and really becamena core of our friendship.,And somewhere along the line,,we decided we didn't want to havenany topic be off limits for discussion,,even if those topics pushed us waynoutside of our friendship comfort zone. 
 LA: And so to most of us,,political conversationsnare a zero-sum game.,There's a winner and there's a loser.,We go for the attack and we spotna weakness in someone's argument.,And here's the important part:,we tend to take every commentnor opinion that's expressed,as a personal affrontnto our own values and beliefs.,But what if changed the waynwe think about these conversations?,What if, in these heated moments,,we chose dialogue over debate?,When we engage in dialogue,nwe flip the script.,We replace our ego and our desire to win,with curiosity, empathy,and a desire to learn.,Instead of comingnfrom a place of judgment,,we are genuinely interestednin the other person's experiences,,their values and their concerns. 
 CQ: You make it sound so simple, Lauran.,But getting to that placenof true dialogue is hard,,especially when we're talkingnabout politics.,It is so easy to get emotionally fired up,about issues that we're passionate about,,and we can let our egonget in the way of truly hearing,the other person's perspective.,And in this crazy political climatenwe're in right now,,unfortunately, we're seeingnan extreme result,of those heated political conversations,,to the point where people are willingnto walk away from their relationships.,In fact, Rasmussen releasedna poll earlier this year,that said 40 percent of peoplenreported that the 2016 election,negatively impactedna personal relationship,,and the Journal of CognitivenNeuroscience tells us,that people tend to feelntheir way to their beliefs,rather than using reasoning,,and that when reason and emotion collide,,it's emotion that invariably wins.,So no wonder it's hardnto talk about these issues. 
 LA: And look, we're justntwo regular friends,who happen to think very differently,about politics and the rolenthat government should play in our lives.,And I know we were all taughtnnot to talk about politics,because it's not polite,,but we need to be able to talk about it,,because it's important to usnand it's a part of who we are. 
 CQ: We have chosennto avoid political debate,and instead engage in dialogue,in order to maintain what we fondly call,our bipartisan friendship. 
 (Laughter) 
 LA: And this electionnand all of the craziness that has followed,has given us several opportunitiesnto practice this skill. 
 (Laughter) 
 Let's start with Januarynand the Women's March.,At this point, you can probably guessnwhich one of us participated. 
 (Laughter) 
 CQ: Oh, the Women's March.,I was annoyed and irritatednthat entire day,,really because of two things.,Number one, the name "Women's March.",As a conservative woman,,the march's platform of issuesndidn't represent me,,and that's OK,,but hearing it talked aboutnas this demonstration of sisterhood,and solidarity for all women,didn't ring true for me.,The other piecenwas the timing of the event,,the fact that it was the daynafter the presidential inauguration.,It felt like we weren't evenngiving the new administration,to actually do anything, good or bad,,before people felt the neednto demonstrate against it. 
 LA: And under normal circumstances,nI would agree with Caitlin.,I think an administrationndoes deserve the benefit of the doubt.,But in this case, I was marchingnto show my concern,that a man with such a poor track recordnwith women and other groups,had been elected as president.,I had to be part of the collective voice,that wanted to send a clear messagento the new president,that we did not accept or condone,his behavior or rhetoricnduring the election. 
 CQ: So I'm already feelingnkind of aggravated,,and then I see this Facebook from Laurannpop up in my social media feed. 
 (Laughter) 
 Seeing Lauran's sons at the marchnand holding signs,took it to a new level for me,nand not in a good way,,because I know these boys,,I love these boys,,and I didn't feel they were old enough,to understand what the march stood for.,I didn't understandnwhy Lauran would choose,to have them participate in that way,,and I assumed it wasn't a choicenthat the boys made for themselves.,But I also know Lauran.,You're an incredible mom,who would never exploitnyour boys in any way,,so I had to stop and check myself.,I had a decision to make.,I could take the easy way out,and just choosennot to say anything to her,,and instead just kind of simmernin my frustration,,or I could ask her to learn morenabout her motivations. 
 LA: And I shared with Caitlin,that we actually startedntalking about the March,weeks before we participated.,And my boys were curiousnas to why the event was being organized,,and this led to somenvery interesting family conversations.,We talked about how in this country,nwe have the right and the privilege,to demonstrate againstnsomething we don't agree with,,and my husband shared with themnwhy he thought it was so important,that men joined the Women's March.,But the most significant reasonnwe marched as a family,is that it was a way for us to honornmy parents' legacy.,They spent their careers,working to defend the rightsnof some of our most vulnerable citizens,,and they passed these valuesndown to me and my brother,,and we want to do the same with our sons. 
 CQ: After talking to Lauran,,I really understood not onlynwhy she felt it was so important to march,,but why she had her boys with her.,And frankly, my assumptions were wrong.,It was the boys who wanted to march,after they talked aboutnthe issues as a family. 
 But what's most importantnabout this example,is to think about the alternative.,Had Lauran and I not talked about it,,I would have been annoyed with her,,and it could have resultednin an undercurrent of disrespect,in our friendship.,But by asking Lauran questions,nit allowed us to use dialogue,to get to a place of true understanding.,Now, to be clear,,our conversation didn't really changenmy mind about how I felt about the March,,but it absolutely changed my thinkingnaround why she brought her boys with her.,And for both of us,nthat dialogue allowed us to understand,each other's perspectivenabout the Women's March,even though we disagreed. 
 LA: The second topic that challengednour ability to engage in dialogue,was around my need to understand,how Caitlin could vote for Trump. 
 (Laughter) 
 Caitlin is a successful professional woman,who is deeply caring and compassionate,,and the Caitlin I know,would never excuse any mannfrom talking about women,the way that Trump didnduring the campaign.,It was hard for me to reconcilenthese two things in my mind.,How could you overlooknthe things that were said? 
 CQ: So I'm guessing I may not benthe only one here that thought,we didn't have the best choicesnfor the presidential election last year. 
 (Laughter) 
 The Republican candidate who I did supportndidn't make it out of the primary,,so when it came time to vote,nI had a decision to make.,And you're right,nthere were some terrible things,that came out during the Trump campaign,,so much so that I almost decidednto just abstain,rather than voting for president,,something I had neverneven considered doing before.,But ultimately,nI did vote for Donald Trump,,and for me it was really a votenfor party over person,,especially recognizingnhow important that presidential pick is,on influencing our judicial branch.,But I shared with Laurannit was a decision I really wrestled with,,and not one that I made lightly. 
 LA: And so after our conversation,nI was struck by a few things.,First, I had fallen victimnto my own confirmation bias.,Because of my strong feelings about Trump,,I had given all Trump votersnthe same attributes,,and none of them forgiving. 
 (Laughter),But knowing Caitlin,nI started to ask questions.,What were Trump votersnreally concerned about?,Under all the divisive language,nwhat was really going on?,What could we learnnabout ourselves and our country,from this unlikely event?,I also learned that we sharedna deep disappointment in this election,,and that we have growing concernsnabout our two-party political system. 
 But the most important thingnabout this conversation,is that it happened at all.,Without an open and honest dialoguenbetween the two of us,,this election would have beennthe elephant in the room,for the next four years, pun intended. 
 (Laughter) 
 CQ: So, look -- 
 (Applause) 
 So, look -- we know it takes worknto get past the difficult,,frustrating and sometimes emotional parts,of having discussions about issuesnlike the Women's March,or why your friend may have votednfor a candidate that you can't stand.,But we need to have these conversations.,Our ability to move past political debate,into true dialogue,is a critical skill we should allnbe focused on right now,,especially with the peoplenthat we care about the most. 
 LA: And it's not just as adultsnthat we need to bottle this behavior.,It's critical that we do itnfor our children as well.,My sons were inundated with this election.,We were listeningnto the news in the morning,,and they were having conversationsnwith their friends at school.,I was concerned that they were picking upnso much polarizing misinformation,,and they were growing really fearfulnof a Trump presidency.,Then one day, after the election,nI was taking my sons to school,,and my younger son,ncompletely out of the blue,,said, "Mom, we don't know anybodynwho voted for Trump, right?" 
 (Laughter) 
 And I paused and I took a deep breath.,"Yes, we do." 
 (Laughter) 
 "The Quattromanis.",And his response was so great.,He kind of got this confusednlook on his face, and he said ...,"But we love them." 
 (Laughter) 
 And I answered, "Yes, we do." 
 (Laughter) 
 And then he said,n"Why would they vote for him?",And I remember stopping and thinking,that it was really importantnhow I answered this question.,Somehow, I had to honornour own family values,and show respect for our friends.,So I finally said,,"They think that's the right directionnfor this country.",And before I had even gottennthe whole sentence out,,he had moved on to the soccer gamenhe was going to play at recess. 
 CQ: So life with boys. 
 (Laughter) 
 So what Lauran and I have discoverednthrough our bipartisan friendship,is the possibility that lives in dialogue.,We have chosen to be genuinely curious,about each other's ideas and perspectives,and to be willing to listen to one anotherneven when we disagree.,And by putting aside our egonand our preconceived ideas,,we've opened ourselves upnto limitless learning.,And perhaps most importantlynfor our relationship,,we have made the commitment to each other,that our friendship is way more important,than either of us being rightnor winning a conversation about politics.,So today, we're asking younto have a conversation.,Talk to someone outsidenof your political party,who might challenge your thinking.,Make an effort to engage with someone,with whom you might typicallynavoid a political conversation.,But remember, the goal isn't to win,,the goal is to listen and to understand,and to be open to learning something new. 
 LA: So let's go back to election night.,As the polls were closing,and it became clear that Trumpnwas going to be our new president,,I was devastated.,I was sad, I was confused,,and I'll be honest -- I was angry.,And then just before midnight,,I received this text message from Caitlin. 
 [I know this is a hard night for you guys.,We are thinking of you. Love you.] 
 And where there so easy could have beennweeks or months of awkwardness,and unspoken hostility, there was this --,an offering of empathynrooted in friendship.,And I knew, in that moment,nthat we would make it through this. 
 CQ: So we must find a waynto engage in meaningful conversations,that are going to move usnforward as a nation,,and we can no longer wait,for our elected officialsnto elevate our national discourse. 
 LA: The challenges aheadnare going to require all of us,to participate in a deepernand more meaningful way ...,and it starts with each one of us,building connection through dialogue --,in our relationships, our communities,and as a country. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Before I get to bulknof what I have to say,,I feel compelled just to mentionna couple of things about myself.,I am not some mystical,,spiritual sort of person.,I'm a science writer.,I studied physics in college.,I used to be a sciencencorrespondent for NPR.,OK, that said:,in the course of workingnon a story for NPR,,I got some advice from an astronomer,that challenged my outlook,,and frankly, changed my life. 
 You see, the story was about an eclipse,,a partial solar eclipsenthat was set to cross the country,in May of 1994.,And the astronomer -- I interviewed him,,and he explained what was going to happennand how to view it,,but he emphasized that, as interestingnas a partial solar eclipse is,,a much rarer total solar eclipsenis completely different.,In a total eclipse,nfor all of two or three minutes,,the moon completely blocksnthe face of the sun,,creating what he describednas the most awe-inspiring spectacle,in all of nature.,And so the advice he gave me was this:,"Before you die," he said,,"you owe it to yourselfnto experience a total solar eclipse." 
 Well honestly,nI felt a little uncomfortable,hearing that from someonenI didn't know very well;,it felt sort of intimate.,But it got my attention,nand so I did some research.,Now the thing about total eclipses is,,if you wait for one to come to you,,you're going to be waiting a long time.,Any given point on earthnexperiences a total eclipse,about once every 400 years.,But if you're willing to travel,nyou don't have to wait that long.,And so I learnednthat a few years later, in 1998,,a total eclipse was goingnto cross the Caribbean. 
 Now, a total eclipse is visiblenonly along a narrow path,,about a hundred miles wide,,and that's where the moon's shadow falls.,It's called the "path of totality.",And in February 1998,,the path of totalitynwas going to cross Aruba.,So I talked to my husband,nand we thought: February? Aruba?,Sounded like a good idea anyway. 
 (Laughter) 
 So we headed south,,to enjoy the sunnand to see what would happen,when the sun briefly went away. 
 Well, the day of the eclipsenfound us and many other people,out behind the Hyatt Regency,,on the beach,,waiting for the show to begin.,And we wore eclipse glassesnwith cardboard frames,and really dark lenses that enabled usnto look at the sun safely.,A total eclipse beginsnas a partial eclipse,,as the moon very slowly makes its waynin front of the sun.,So first it looked the sunnhad a little notch in its edge,,and then that notch grewnlarger and larger,,turning the sun into a crescent.,And it was all very interesting,nbut I wouldn't say it was spectacular.,I mean, the day remained bright.,If I hadn't knownnwhat was going on overhead,,I wouldn't have noticed anything unusual. 
 Well, about 10 minutes beforenthe total solar eclipse was set to begin,,weird things started to happen.,A cool wind kicked up.,Daylight looked odd,nand shadows became very strange;,they looked bizarrely sharp,,as if someone had turned upnthe contrast knob on the TV.,Then I looked offshore,nand I noticed running lights on boats,,so clearly it was getting dark,,although I hadn't realized it.,Well soon, it was obviousnit was getting dark.,It felt like my eyesight was failing. 
 And then all of a sudden,,the lights went out.,Well, at that,,a cheer erupted from the beach,,and I took off my eclipse glasses,,because at this pointnduring the total eclipse,,it was safe to look at the sunnwith the naked eye.,And I glanced upward,,and I was just dumbstruck. 
 Now, consider that, at this point,nI was in my mid-30s.,I had lived on earth long enoughnto know what the sky looks like.,I mean -- 
 (Laughter) 
 I'd seen blue skies and grey skies,and starry skies and angry skies,and pink skies at sunrise.,But here was a sky I had never seen. 
 First, there were the colors.,Up above, it was a deep purple-grey,,like twilight.,But on the horizon it was orange,,like sunset,,360 degrees.,And up above, in the twilight,,bright stars and planets had come out.,So there was Jupiter,and there was Mercury,and there was Venus.,They were all in a line. 
 And there, along this line,,was this thing,,this glorious, bewildering thing.,It looked like a wreathnwoven from silvery thread,,and it just hung out therenin space, shimmering.,That was the sun's outer atmosphere,,the solar corona.,And pictures just don't do it justice.,It's not just a ring or halonaround the sun;,it's finely textured,nlike it's made out of strands of silk.,And although it lookednnothing like our sun,,of course, I knew that's what it was.,So there was the sun,nand there were the planets,,and I could see how the planetsnrevolve around the sun.,It's like I had left our solar system,and was standing on some alien world,,looking back at creation. 
 And for the first time in my life,,I just felt viscerally connectednto the universe,in all of its immensity.,Time stopped,,or it just kind of felt nonexistent,,and what I beheld with my eyes --,I didn't just see it,,it felt like a vision.,And I stood there in this nirvana,for all of 174 seconds --nless than three minutes --,when all of a sudden, it was over.,The sun burst out,,the blue sky returned,,the stars and the planetsnand the corona were gone.,The world returned to normal.,But I had changed. 
 And that's how I became an umbraphile --,an eclipse chaser. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, this is how I spend my timenand hard-earned money.,Every couple of years, I head offnto wherever the moon's shadow will fall,to experience another couple minutes,of cosmic bliss,,and to share the experience with others:,with friends in Australia,,with an entire city in Germany.,In 1999, in Munich,nI joined hundreds of thousands,who filled the streets and the rooftopsnand cheered in unison,as the solar corona emerged.,And over time, I've become something else:,an eclipse evangelist.,I see it as my job,to pay forward the advicenthat I received all those years ago.,And so let me tell you:,before you die,,you owe it to yourselfnto experience a total solar eclipse.,It is the ultimate experience of awe. 
 Now, that word, "awesome,"nhas grown so overused,that it's lost its original meaning.,True awe, a sense of wondernand insignificance,in the face of somethingnenormous and grand,,is rare in our lives.,But when you experience it, it's powerful.,Awe dissolves the ego.,It makes us feel connected.,Indeed, it promotesnempathy and generosity.,Well, there is nothing truly more awesomenthan a total solar eclipse. 
 Unfortunately, few Americansnhave seen one,,because it's been 38 years,since one last touchednthe continental United States,and 99 years since one last crossednthe breadth of the nation.,But that is about to change.,Over the next 35 years,,five total solar eclipses will visitnthe continental United States,,and three of themnwill be especially grand.,Six weeks from now, on August 21, 2017 -- 
 (Applause) 
 the moon's shadow will racenfrom Oregon to South Carolina.,April 8, 2024, the moon's shadownheads north from Texas to Maine.,In 2045, on August 12,,the path cuts from California to Florida. 
 I say:,What if we made these holidays?,What if we -- 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 What if we all stood together,,as many people as possible,,in the shadow of the moon?,Just maybe, this shared experience of awenwould help heal our divisions,,get us to treat each othernjust a bit more humanely. 
 Now, admittedly, some folks considernmy evangelizing a little out there;,my obsession, eccentric.,I mean, why focus so much attentionnon something so brief?,Why cross the globe --nor state lines, for that matter --,for something that lasts three minutes?,As I said:,I am not a spiritual person.,I don't believe in God.,I wish I did.,But when I think of my own mortality --,and I do, a lot --,when I think of everyone I have lost,,my mother in particular,,what soothes me,is that moment of awe I had in Aruba.,I picture myself on that beach,,looking at that sky,,and I remember how I felt.,My existence may be temporary,,but that's OK because, my gosh,,look at what I'm a part of. 
 And so this is a lesson I've learned,,and it's one that appliesnto life in general:,duration of experiencendoes not equal impact.,One weekend, one conversation --nhell, one glance --,can change everything.,Cherish those momentsnof deep connection with other people,,with the natural world,,and make them a priority.,Yes, I chase eclipses.,You might chase something else.,But it's not about the 174 seconds.,It's about how they change,the years that come after. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I took a cell phone,and accidentally made myself famous. 
 (Laughter) 
 I was just talkingnabout the things that I cared about,,but with the click of a button,and an incendiary viral video,I propelled myself into overnight stardom.,When I say overnight,,I mean I literally woke upnthe next morning,with so many notifications on my phone,,I thought I sleptnthrough a national tragedy. 
 (Laughter) 
 It was the craziest thing, guys,,but when it came to my influencenand my exposure,,I literally took a quantum leap.,So I made more videos,and the subject matter of my videos,was often the most divisive subjectnin American life,,but it was the way that I articulated race,that made me somewhatnof a digital lightning rod.,See, being a survivor myselfnof police brutality,and having lost a childhood friend,,Alonzo Ashley,,at the hands of the police,,I had a little somethingnto say about the topic.,You see, this was at the heightnof the Black Lives Matter furor,and people seemed to be turningnto me to articulate their viewpoints,,and honestly, it was sort of overwhelming. 
 You see, the internetnhas this interesting quality.,In one way, it totallynbrought the world together,,and I remember being a kid,and all of this utopian propagandanwas being dumped on us,about how the World Wide Web,was going to span the reachesnof people across the globe.,But as it turns out, people are people. 
 (Laughter) 
 And this magical superhighway,also took the demons of our nature,and gave them Ferraris. 
 (Laughter) 
 You see, technology, y'all,nis a lot like money.,It just brings out what's alreadyninside you and amplifies it.,And so I soon became familiarnwith the phenomenon of the internet troll.,These guys seem to livenbeneath the bridges,of said superhighway -- 
 (Laughter) 
 And they also missed the memo aboutnthe enlightenment of the internet age.,I remember being called,highly colorful racial slurs,by those who usenthe anonymity of the internet,as a Klan hood.,And some of themnwere pretty creative, actually,,but others were pretty wounding,,especially navigatingnthe post-traumatic world,of a police brutality survivor,in the height of Black Lives Matter,,with all of these peoplenbeing killed on my timeline.,To these trolls, I wasn't a human.,I was an idea, an object,,a caricature.,Did I mention that this race stuffncan be kind of divisive?,You see, I'm an innately curious person,and as I drew my sword to engagenin epic battles in the comment section -- 
 (Laughter) 
 I also began to notice,that a few of my trollsnactually had brains,,which made me even more curiousnand what to understand them even further.,And although these supposed morons,engaged in what appearednto be original thought,,I said to myself,,"Um, these guys are highly misinformed,,at least according to my knowledge.",Where are these guysngetting these arguments from?,Like, was there some kindnof alternative universe,with alternative facts? 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 Was history and gravitynoptional over there?,I don't know.,But I needed to know.nLike, I wanted to know.,And as it turns out, I had no ideanabout digital echo chambers.,That same target marketing algorithm,that feeds you morenof the products you like to buy,also feeds you morenof the news that you like to hear.,I had been living in an online universe,that just reflectednmy worldview back to me.,So my timeline was pretty liberal.,I had no Breitbartnor Infowars or Fox News.,No, no, I was all MSNBCnand The Daily Show,,CNN and theGrio, right?,Well, these trolls were hoppingnthe dimensional doorway,and I needed to figure out how. 
 (Laughter) 
 So what I decided to do,was trick the Facebook algorithm,into feeding me more newsnthat I didn't necessarily agree with,,and this worked fine for a while,nbut it wasn't enough,,because my online footprint,already established the patternsnthat I like to hear.,So with the anonymity of the internet,,I went undercover. 
 (Laughter) 
 I set up this ghost profilenand went crazy.,Now, on a practical level,nit was very simple,,but on an emotional level,nit was kind of daunting,,especially with the racist vitriolnthat I had experienced.,But what I didn't realizenis that my trolls were inoculating me,,thickening my skin,,making me immune to viewpointsnthat I didn't necessarily agree with,,and so I didn't react to the same thingsnas I would have several months prior.,All right? So I pressed on. 
 Noticing that this stuffnalso worked on YouTube,,I became Lucius25,nwhite supremacist lurker -- 
 (Laughter) 
 And digitally I began to infiltratenthe infamous alt-right movement.,Now, my doppelgänger,was Edgar Rice Burroughs'nJohn Carter character -- 
 (Laughter) 
 a sci-fi hero who was oncena Confederate soldier.,And to think, like, years ago,nI would have needed acting training,and, like, makeup and a fake ID.,Now I could just lurk.,And so I started,with a little Infowars,,went on into some American Renaissance,,National Vanguard Alliance,,and, you know, I startedncommenting on videos,,talking bad about Al Sharptonnand Black Lives Matter.,I started bemoaning race baitersnlike Eric Holder and Barack Obama,and just mirroringnthe antiblack sentiments,that were thrown at me.,And to be honest,nit was kind of exhilarating. 
 (Laughter) 
 Like, I would literally spend daysnclicking through my new racist profile -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Goofing off at work in Aryan land.nIt was something else. 
 (Laughter) 
 And so I then startednvisiting some of the pages,of my former trolls,,and a lot of these guysnwere just regular Joes,,a lot of outdoorsmen,nhunters, computer nerds,,some of them family guysnwith videos of their families.,I mean, for all I know, some of y'allncould be in this room right now. Right? 
 (Laughter) 
 But when I went undercover,nI found a lovely plethora of characters,,luminaries like Milo Yiannopoulos,nRichard Spencer and David Duke.,All of these guys werenthought leaders in their own right,,but over time, the alt-right movementnended up using their information,to fuel their momentum.,And I'm going to tell you what elsenled to the momentum of the alt-right:,the left wing's wholesale demonizationnof everything white and male.,If you are a pale-skinned penis-haver,nyou're in league with Satan. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, would you believe,,would you believe that some peoplenfind that offensive?,And -- 
 (Laughter) 
 And so, I mean, listen,,the fact is that millennialsnget a lifetime of diet brand history.,I mean, America seems to be hellbentnon filling its textbooks,with CliffsNotes versionsnof its dark past.,This severely, severely decontextualizesnrace and the anger associated with it,,and that is fertile groundnfor alt-facts to grow.,Add in the wild landscape of the internet,and it's easy to sellnrebranded "Mein Kampf" ideas,to a generation who has beennfailed by public schools. 
 A lot of these ideas, easily debunked.,Alt-facts have that quality.,However, one theme kept screaming at menthrough the subtext of those arguments,,and that was,,why should I be hatednfor who I cannot help but be?,Now, as a black man in America,nthat resonated with me.,I have spent so much time,defending myselfnagainst attempts to demonize me,and make me apologize for who I am,,trying to portray menas something that I'm not,,some kind of thug or gangster,na menace to society.,Unexpected compassion.,Wow.,Now, listen,,the historical source of the demonizationnof black males and white males,is highly different,,and where you fall on this argument,,sadly, tends to be an accident of birth. 
 Now, you're probably surprisednby this perspective,,and so was I.,Never in a billion years did I thinknthat I could have some kind of compassion,for people who hated my guts.,Now, mind you, not enough compassionnlike I want to be friends.,I don't have infinite olive branchesnto extend to people,who, like, would not wantnto see me on this planet. Right?,But just enough compassion to understandnhow they got to where they are.,And to be honest,,there were a couple of fair points.,One of them was how liberalsnhave this wide acceptance for everybody,except for those with honestly heldnconservative viewpoints. 
 (Laughter) 
 Heaven forbid you love God,nthis country and mean it. Right? 
 And another thing that they talked aboutnwas this fear that they had,of something that they labelednas "white genocide,",that diversity would be a forcenthat would wipe them out.,Now listen, I know what it is to fear,for the fate of your people.,Between crack, AIDS, gang violence,,mass incarceration,ngentrification, police shootings,,black people have morenthan enough reasons to stay up at night.,But if nature is into diversitynand you are not,,you're going to lose that fight, buddy. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 You see, nature doesn't carenabout your race. That's man-made.,Nature just cares about healthy organisms,,and your precious ethnic featuresnare expendable to that aim.,So the moment that you let gonof that racist identity,and relatch onto humanity,,all your problems go away. 
 (Applause) 
 I'm going to tell younwhat race ain't about to die out:,the human race.,Join the party. The water's great.,Until the water gets too hot,nbut that's another TED Talk. 
 (Laughter) 
 The point is that to getnto this point of understanding,,you have to let go of that fear,and embrace your curiosity,,and sadly, too many peoplenwill not take that journey,to see the world from the other side.,And, I mean, let's be honest,,that doesn't just go for progressives,,but also to the right wingnand conservatives.,You know, as fairnas some of their points were,,they were still trappednin their own echo chambers,,recycling old, outdated points of view,,never getting a diversity in perspective,,not making them well-roundednin their worldview.,So they're not hearingncertain anti-racist and political voices,,voices like Tim Wise,and Michelle Alexander, Dr. Joy DeGruy,nBoyce Watkins, Tariq Nasheed.,All of these voices have the answersnto the questions that they want,,but unfortunately they will not hear themndue to the power of these echo chambers.,We have got to break outnof these digital divides,,because as our technology advances,,the consequences of our tribalismnbecome more dangerous. 
 And this whole experiencentaught me something:,our gadgets ain't going to save us.,All these technological devices,are only mastery of the universenout there, not the one in here.,And so that's all IQ, not EQ.,That's a dangerous imbalance.,Where do you getnthe emotional intelligence,,the character development,,the virtues of patience,nforbearance, compassion,,you know, the things that make surenthat these devices, however advanced,,become a blessing and not a curse?,Seems to be me that humanity itselfnneeds an upgrade. 
 Now -- 
 (Applause) 
 That's a big task, understandably,,but I don't believenin any kind of unbeatable monster.,There was no giant out therenwithout perhaps a simple Achilles heel.,And what if I told you,that one of the best waysnto actually overcome this,is to have courageous conversations,with difficult people,,people who do not see the worldnthe same way that you see the world?,Oh yes, folks, conversations may benindeed the key to that upgrade,,because remember,,language was the first formnof virtual reality.,It is literally a symbolic representationnof the physical world,,and through this device,nwe change the physical world.,Keep in mind, conversations stop violence,,conversations start countries,,they build bridges,,and when the chips are down,,conversations are the last toolsnthat humans use,before they pick up their guns.,And I ain't talkingnabout online safe conversations,from the security of your laptop.,No.,I'm talking about in-your-facenconversations with real, breathing people.,And for me, this looksnlike running a community forum,called Shop Talk Live. 
 Now, in Shop Talk Live --nsomebody's been there, right?,In Shop Talk Live,,we have the conversationsnthat change lives.,We meet the communitynright where they are,,and we've done everythingnfrom divert gang violence in real time,to help find people jobs,to mentoring homeless youth.,And the reason why we needed to do this,is because there was a severe lacknof trust in the black community,due to the violence of the crack era.,And so we ended up takingnagency into our own hands,,solving our own problems,,not waiting for anybody else.,And the truth is,,from the mayor to the felon,,you're going to find themnin that barber shop.,And so what we did was justnorganize what was already going on.,And so what I started doingnwas mining these alternative viewpoints,from these alternative digital universes,,dissecting them, breaking them downninto controversial talking points.,Then, with my cell phone,,I flipped the internet against itself,and began to broadcastnthese live conversations,to my online followers.,This made them want to leaventhe safety of their laptops,and meet us in personnto have real conversations,with real people in real life.,And we did this. Thank you. 
 (Applause) 
 Sometimes I sit back,nand I reflect on the paradox,of me just trying to solve the problems,,us trying to solve the problemsnin our own communities --,we build bridgesnto so many other communities,,from the LGBTQ communitynto the Arab immigrant community,and even sat down with somebodynwith a Confederate flag on their hat,and talked about the thingsnthat actually matter. 
 It is time that we stop trying,to hack our waynaround the human experience.,There is no way out of each other.,Stop trying to find one. 
 (Applause) 
 We have to understand something.,Human beings all want the same things,and we have to go throughneach other to get these things.,These courageous conversationsnare the way that these bridges are built.,It's time that we startnseeing people as people,and not simply the ideasnthat we project onto them or react to.,Human beings are not the barriers,but the gatewaysnto the very things that we want.,This is a collectivenand conscious evolution. 
 My journey began withna terribly popular cell phone video,and a fallen friend.,Your journey begins right about now.,Join the renaissance in human connection.,It is going to happen with or without you.,My suggestion: pick a topic,nand start a community dialogue,in your neck of the woods.,Meet folks back in real life.,And I'm going to tell you,,when you trick the algorithmnof your existence,,you will get some diversified experiences.,It is time to grow, people.,And when we do this, not if,,it will be clearnthat the key to this upgrade,was always our inner world,nnot some device that we create,,and the doorwaysnto this experience is now,,and will forever be, each other. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)When someone mentions Cuba,,what do you think about?,Classic, classic cars?,Perhaps good cigars?,Maybe you thinknof a famous baseball player.,What about when somebodynmentions North Korea?,You think about those missile tests,,maybe their notorious leader,or his good friend, Dennis Rodman. 
 (Laughter) 
 One thing that likely doesn't come to mind,is a vision of a country,,an open economy,,whose citizens have access to a wide rangenof affordable consumer products. 
 I'm not here to argue how these countriesngot to where they are today.,I simply want to use themnas an example of countries and citizens,who have been affected,nnegatively affected,,by a trade policy that restricts imports,and protects local industries.,Recently we've heard a number of countries,talk about restricting imports,and protecting their local,ndomestic industries.,Now, this may sound fine in a sound bite,,but what it really is is protectionism.,We heard a lot about thisnduring the 2016 presidential election.,We heard about itnduring the Brexit debates,and most recentlynduring the French elections.,In fact, it's beenna really important topic,being talked about around the world,,and many aspiring political leaders,are running on platformsnpositioning protectionism as a good thing. 
 Now, I could see why they thinknprotectionism is good,,because sometimesnit seems like trade is unfair.,Some have blamed trade,for some of the problemsnwe've been having here at home in the US.,For years we've been hearing,about the loss of high-payingnUS manufacturing jobs.,Many think that manufacturingnis declining in the US,because companies are movingntheir operations offshore,to markets with lower-cost labor,like China, Mexico and Vietnam.,They also think trade agreementsnsometimes are unfair,,like NAFTA,and the Trans-Pacific Partnership,,because these trade agreementsnallow companies,to reimport those cheaplynproduced goods back into the US,and other countriesnfrom where the jobs were taken.,So it kind of feels like the exporters win,and the importers lose. 
 Now, the reality is,output in the manufacturingnsector in the US,is actually growing,,but we are losing jobs.,We're losing lots of them.,In fact, from 2000 to 2010,,5.7 million manufacturing jobs were lost.,But they're not being lostnfor the reasons you might think.,Mike Johnson in Toledo, Ohio,didn't lose his jobs at the factory,to Miguel Sanchez in Monterrey, Mexico.,No.,Mike lost his job to a machine.,87 percent of lost manufacturing jobs,have been eliminatednbecause we've made improvements,in our own productivitynthrough automation.,So that means that one out of 10nlost manufacturing jobs,was due to offshoring.,Now, this is not just a US phenomenon.,No.,In fact, automation is spreadingnto every production line,in every country around the world. 
 But look, I get it:,if you just lost your job,and then you read in the newspaper,that your old companynjust struck up a deal with China,,it's easy to think you were just replaced,in a one-for-one deal. 
 When I hear stories like this,nI think that what people picture,is that trade happensnbetween only two countries.,Manufacturers in one country,produce products and they export them,to consumers in other countries,,and it feels likenthe manufacturing countries win,and the importing countries lose. 
 Well, reality's a little bit different.,I'm a supply chain professional,,and I live and work in Mexico.,And I work in the middle,of a highly connected networknof manufacturers,all collaborating from around the world,to produce manynof the products we use today.,What I see,from my front-row seat in Mexico City,actually looks more like this.,And this is a more accurate depictionnof what trade really looks like.,I've had the pleasure of being able to see,how many different productsnare manufactured,,from golf clubs to laptop computers,to internet servers, automobiles,and even airplanes.,And believe me, none of itnhappens in a straight line. 
 Let me give you an example.,A few months ago, I was touringnthe manufacturing plant,of a multinational aerospace company,in Querétaro, Mexico,,and the VP of logistics points outna completed tail assembly.,It turns out the tail assembliesnare assembled from panels,that are manufactured in France,,and they're assembled in Mexico,using components imported from the US.,When those tail assemblies are done,,they're exported via truck to Canada,to their primary assembly plant,where they come together,with thousands of other parts,,like the wings and the seats,and the little shadesnover the little windows,,all coming in to becomena part of a new airplane.,Think about it.,These new airplanes,,before they even take their first flight,,they have more stamps in their passports,than Angelina Jolie. 
 Now, this approach to processingngoes on all around the world,to manufacture many of the products,we use every day,,from skin cream to airplanes.,When you go home tonight,ntake a look in your house.,You might be surprised to findna label that looks like this one:,"Manufactured in the USAnfrom US and foreign parts." 
 Economist Michael Porter,described what's going on here best.,Many decades ago, he saidnthat it's most beneficial for a country,to focus on producing the productsnit can produce most efficiently,and trading for the rest.,So what he's talking about herenis shared production,,and efficiency is the name of the game.,You've probably seen an example of this,at home or at work. 
 Let's take a look at an example.,Think about how your house was built,or your kitchen renovated.,Typically, there's a general contractor,who is responsiblenfor coordinating the efforts,of all the different contractors:,an architect to draw the plans,,an earth-moving companynto dig the foundation,,a plumber, a carpenter and so on.,So why doesn't the general contractor,pick just one company,to do all the work,,like, say, the architect?,Because this is silly.,The general contractor selects experts,because it takes years,to learn and master,how to do each of the tasks it takesnto build a house or renovate a kitchen,,some of them requiring special training.,Think about it:,Would you want your architectnto install your toilet?,Of course not. 
 So let's apply this processnto the corporate world.,Companies today focus on manufacturing,what they produce bestnand most efficiently,,and they trade for everything else.,So this means they rely,on a global, interconnected,ninterdependent network of manufacturers,to produce these products.,In fact, that network is so interconnected,it's almost impossible,to dismantle and producenproducts in just one country. 
 Let's take a looknat the interconnected web,we saw a few moments ago,,and let's focus on just one strand,between the US and Mexico.,The Wilson Institute saysnthat shared production represents,40 percent of the half a trillion dollarsnin trade between the US and Mexico.,That's about 200 billion dollars,,or the same as the GDP for Portugal.,So let's just imagine,that the US decides to impose,a 20 percent border taxnon all imports from Mexico.,OK, fine.,But do you think Mexico is justngoing to stand by and let that happen?,No. No way.,So in retaliation,nthey impose a similar tax,on all goods being imported from the US,,and a little game of tit-for-tat ensues,,and 20 percent -- just imaginenthat 20 percent duties,are added to every good,nproduct, product component,crossing back and forth across the border,,and you could be looking at morenthan a 40 percent increase in duties,,or 80 billion dollars.,Now, don't kid yourself,,these costs are going to be passed along,to you and to me.,Now, let's think about what impactnthat might have on some of the products,,or the prices of the products,nthat we buy every day.,So if a 30 percent increase in dutiesnwere actually passed along,,we would be looking at somenpretty important increases in prices.,A Lincoln MKZ would gonfrom 37,000 dollars to 48,000.,And the price of a Sharp 60-inch HDTV,would go from 898 dollarsnto 1,167 dollars.,And the price of a 16-ounce jarnof CVS skin moisturizer,would go from 13 dollars to 17 dollars.,Now, remember, this is only lookingnat one strand of the production chain,between the US and Mexico,,so multiply this outnacross all of the strands.,The impact could be considerable. 
 Now, just think about this:,even if we were ablento dismantle this network,and produce products in just one country,,which by the way is easier said than done,,we would still onlynbe saving or protecting,one out of 10 lost manufacturing jobs.,That's right, because remember,,most of those jobs, 87 percent,,were lost due to improvementsnin our own productivity.,And unfortunately,nthose jobs, they're gone for good.,So the real question is,,does it make sense for usnto drive up prices,to the point where many of us can't affordnthe basic goods we use every day,for the purpose of saving a job,that might be eliminatednin a couple of years anyway? 
 The reality is that shared production,allows us to manufacturenhigher quality products,at lower costs.,It's that simple.,It allows us to get more,out of the limited resourcesnand expertise we have,and at the same timenbenefit from lower prices.,It's really important to remember,that for shared productionnto be effective,,it relies on efficient cross-bordernmovement of raw materials,,components and finished products. 
 So remember this:,the next time you're hearing somebodyntry to sell you on the idea,that protectionism is a good deal,,it's just not. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)So there's a lot of validnconcern these days,that our technology is getting so smart,that we've put ourselvesnon the path to a jobless future.,And I think the examplenof a self-driving car,is actually the easiest one to see.,So these are going to be fantasticnfor all kinds of different reasons.,But did you know that "driver"nis actually the most common job,in 29 of the 50 US states?,What's going to happen to these jobsnwhen we're no longer driving our cars,or cooking our food,or even diagnosing our own diseases? 
 Well, a recent studynfrom Forrester Research,goes so far to predictnthat 25 million jobs,might disappear over the next 10 years.,To put that in perspective,,that's three times as many jobs lostnin the aftermath of the financial crisis.,And it's not just blue-collar jobsnthat are at risk.,On Wall Street and across Silicon Valley,nwe are seeing tremendous gains,in the quality of analysisnand decision-making,because of machine learning.,So even the smartest, highest-paid peoplenwill be affected by this change. 
 What's clear is that no matternwhat your job is,,at least some, if not all of your work,,is going to be done by a robotnor software in the next few years.,And that's exactly why peoplenlike Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates,are talking about the need forngovernment-funded minimum income levels.,But if our politicians can't agreenon things like health care,or even school lunches,,I just don't see a pathnwhere they'll find consensus,on something as big and as expensivenas universal basic life income.,Instead, I think the responsenneeds to be led by us in industry.,We have to recognizenthe change that's ahead of us,and start to design the new kinds of jobs,that will still be relevantnin the age of robotics. 
 The good news is that we havenfaced down and recovered,two mass extinctions of jobs before.,From 1870 to 1970,,the percent of American workersnbased on farms fell by 90 percent,,and then again from 1950 to 2010,,the percent of Americansnworking in factories,fell by 75 percent.,The challenge we face this time,nhowever, is one of time.,We had a hundred yearsnto move from farms to factories,,and then 60 years to fully build outna service economy.,The rate of change today,suggests that we may only haven10 or 15 years to adjust,,and if we don't react fast enough,,that means by the timentoday's elementary-school students,are college-aged,,we could be livingnin a world that's robotic,,largely unemployed and stucknin kind of un-great depression. 
 But I don't think it has to be this way.,You see, I work in innovation,,and part of my job is to shape hownlarge companies apply new technologies.,Certainly some of these technologies,are even specifically designednto replace human workers.,But I believe that if we startntaking steps right now,to change the nature of work,,we can not only create environmentsnwhere people love coming to work,but also generatenthe innovation that we need,to replace the millions of jobsnthat will be lost to technology.,I believe that the keynto preventing our jobless future,is to rediscover what makes us human,,and to create a new generationnof human-centered jobs,that allow us to unlocknthe hidden talents and passions,that we carry with us every day. 
 But first, I thinknit's important to recognize,that we brought this problem on ourselves.,And it's not just because, you know,nwe are the one building the robots.,But even though most jobsnleft the factory decades ago,,we still hold on to this factory mindset,of standardization and de-skilling.,We still define jobsnaround procedural tasks,and then pay people for the numbernof hours that they perform these tasks.,We've created narrow job definitions,like cashier, loan processornor taxi driver,and then asked peoplento form entire careers,around these singular tasks. 
 These choices have left us withnactually two dangerous side effects.,The first is that thesennarrowly defined jobs,will be the firstnto be displaced by robots,,because single-task robotsnare just the easiest kinds to build.,But second, we have accidentally made it,so that millions of workersnaround the world,have unbelievably boring working lives. 
 (Laughter) 
 Let's take the examplenof a call center agent.,Over the last few decades,nwe brag about lower operating costs,because we've taken mostnof the need for brainpower,out of the personnand put it into the system.,For most of their day,nthey click on screens,,they read scripts.,They act more like machines than humans.,And unfortunately,nover the next few years,,as our technology gets more advanced,,they, along with peoplenlike clerks and bookkeepers,,will see the vast majoritynof their work disappear. 
 To counteract this,nwe have to start creating new jobs,that are less centerednon the tasks that a person does,and more focused on the skillsnthat a person brings to work.,For example, robots are greatnat repetitive and constrained work,,but human beings have an amazing ability,to bring togetherncapability with creativity,when faced with problemsnthat we've never seen before.,It's when every daynbrings a little bit of a surprise,that we have designed work for humans,and not for robots.,Our entrepreneurs and engineersnalready live in this world,,but so do our nurses and our plumbers,and our therapists.,You know, it's the naturenof too many companies and organizations,to just ask people to come to worknand do your job.,But if you work is better done by a robot,,or your decisions better made by an AI,,what are you supposed to be doing? 
 Well, I think for the manager,,we need to realistically think aboutnthe tasks that will be disappearing,over the next few years,and start planning for more meaningful,nmore valuable work that should replace it.,We need to create environments,where both human beings and robots thrive.,I say, let's give more work to the robots,,and let's start with the worknthat we absolutely hate doing.,Here, robot,,process this painfully idiotic report. 
 (Laughter) 
 And move this box. Thank you. 
 (Laughter) 
 And for the human beings,,we should follow the advice from HarrynDavis at the University of Chicago.,He says we have to make it so that peoplendon't leave too much of themselves,in the trunk of their car.,I mean, human beingsnare amazing on weekends.,Think about the people that you knownand what they do on Saturdays.,They're artists, carpenters,nchefs and athletes.,But on Monday, they're backnto being Junior HR Specialist,and Systems Analyst 3. 
 (Laughter) 
 You know, these narrow job titlesnnot only sound boring,,but they're actuallyna subtle encouragement,for people to make narrownand boring job contributions.,But I've seen firsthandnthat when you invite people to be more,,they can amaze usnwith how much more they can be. 
 A few years ago,nI was working at a large bank,that was trying to bring more innovationninto its company culture.,So my team and I designedna prototyping contest,that invited anyone to buildnanything that they wanted.,We were actually trying to figure out,whether or notnthe primary limiter to innovation,was a lack of ideas or a lack of talent,,and it turns out it was neither one.,It was an empowerment problem.,And the resultsnof the program were amazing.,We started by invitingnpeople to reenvision,what it is they could bring to a team.,This contest was not only a chancento build anything that you wanted,but also be anything that you wanted.,And when people were no longernlimited by their day-to-day job titles,,they felt free to bring all kindsnof different skills and talents,to the problemsnthat they were trying to solve.,We saw technology people being designers,nmarketing people being architects,,and even finance people showing offntheir ability to write jokes. 
 (Laughter) 
 We ran this program twice,,and each time more than 400 peoplenbrought their unexpected talents to work,and solved problems that they had beennwanting to solve for years.,Collectively, they creatednmillions of dollars of value,,building things like a betterntouch-tone system for call centers,,easier desktop tools for branches,and even a thank you card system,that has become a cornerstonenof the employee working experience.,Over the course of the eight weeks,,people flexed muscles that they neverndreamed of using at work.,People learned new skills,,they met new people,,and at the end, somebodynpulled me aside and said,,"I have to tell you,,the last few weeks has beennone of the most intense,,hardest working experiencesnof my entire life,,but not one second of it felt like work." 
 And that's the key.,For those few weeks, peoplengot to be creators and innovators.,They had been dreaming of solutions,to problems that had beennbugging them for years,,and this was a chance to turnnthose dreams into a reality.,And that dreaming is an important partnof what separates us from machines.,For now, our machinesndo not get frustrated,,they do not get annoyed,,and they certainly don't imagine. 
 But we, as human beings --,we feel pain,,we get frustrated.,And it's when we're most annoyednand most curious,that we're motivated to digninto a problem and create change.,Our imaginations are the birthplacenof new products, new services,,and even new industries. 
 I believe that the jobs of the future,will come from the minds of people,who today we callnanalysts and specialists,,but only if we give them the freedomnand protection that they need to grow,into becoming explorers and inventors.,If we really want to robot-proof our jobs,,we, as leaders, neednto get out of the mindset,of telling people what to do,and instead start asking themnwhat problems they're inspired to solve,and what talentsnthey want to bring to work.,Because when you can bringnyour Saturday self to work on Wednesdays,,you'll look forward to Mondays more,,and those feelingsnthat we have about Mondays,are part of what makes us human. 
 And as we redesign worknfor an era of intelligent machines,,I invite you all to work alongside me,to bring more humanitynto our working lives. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Today, more than halfnof the world's population lives in cities.,The urbanization processnstarted in the late 1700s,and has been increasing since then.,The prediction is that by 2050,,66 percent of the populationnwill live in cities,and the United Nations,nthe World Health Organization,,the World Economic Forum, are warning us,,if we don't plannfor the increased density,,current problems in our cities,nlike inequality, congestion, crime,can only get worse.,As a result, urban plannersnand city developers,are putting a lot of effort and creativity,in designing our future,ndenser, bigger cities. 
 But I have a different opinion.,I think urbanization is actuallynreaching the end of its cycle,,and now people are going to startnmoving back to the countryside.,And you may think,n"But what about the trend?",Well, let me tell you,,socioeconomic trends don't last forever.,You know, 12,000 years ago,everybody was perfectly happy,roaming the land, hunting and gathering.,And then, the trend changes,,and the new thingnis to live in a farm and have cattle,,until it changes again.,When we get to the industrial revolution.,Actually, that is what startednthe urbanization process.,And you know what triggered it?,Steam power, machines,,new chemical processes --,in two words, technological innovation.,And I believe technologyncan also bring the end of this cycle. 
 I've been working on innovationnfor most of my career.,I love it. I love my job.,It allows me to work with drones,nwith 3D printers and smart glasses,,and not just those you can buy in the shopnbut also prototypes.,It's a lot of fun sometimes.,Now, some of these technologies,are opening new possibilitiesnthat will radically change,the way we did things before,and in a few years,,they may allow usnto enjoy the benefits of city life,from anywhere.,Think about it.,If you could live in a placenwith a lower crime rate,and more space,and a lower cost of living,and less traffic,,of course many people would want that,,but they feel they don't have a choice.,You have to live in the city. 
 Well, in the past,npeople moved to the cities,not because they loved the city itself,but for the thingsnyou could have in a city,,more job opportunities,,easier access to services and goods,and a rich social life.,So let's dive deeper. 
 More jobs and career opportunities.,Is that still true today,,because the office peoplenare starting to realize,that working in the officenand being in the office,may not be the same thing anymore.,According to a studynby Global Workplace Analytics,,more than 80 percent of the US workforcenwould like to work from home.,And do you know how much it costsnfor a company to even have an office?,11,000 dollars per employee per year.,If only half of those workers,would teleworkneven 50 percent of the time,,the savings in the statesnwould exceed 500 billion dollars,,and it could reduce greenhouse gasesnby 54 million tons.,That is the equivalent,of 10 million carsnoff the streets for a whole year.,But even though most peoplenwould want to telework,,current technologynmakes the experience isolating.,It's not comfortable.,It doesn't feel like being there.,But that is going to change,by the convergence of two technologies:,augmented reality and telepresence robots. 
 Augmented reality already today,allows you to take your officenenvironment everywhere with you.,All you need is a wearable computer,na pair of smart glasses,,and you can take your emailsnand your spreadsheets,with you wherever you go.,And video conferences and video callsnhave become very common these days,,but they still need improvement.,I mean, all those little facesnon a flat screen,,sometimes you don'tneven know who is talking. 
 Now, we already have somethingnway better than static videocalls:,your average telepresence robot.,I call it tablet on a stick. 
 (Laughter) 
 You can control, you can move around,,you can control what you're looking at.,It's way better, but far from perfect.,You know how they say,that most humanncommunication is nonverbal?,Well, the robot doesn'tngive you any of that.,It looks like an alien.,But with advances in augmented reality,,it will be easy to wrap the robotnin a nice hologram,that actually looksnand moves like a person.,That will do it.,Or else, forget the robot.,We go full VR,,and everybody meets in cyberspace.,Give it a couple of yearsnand that will feel so real,,you won't tell the difference. 
 So what was the next reasonnwhy people move to cities?,Access to services and goods.,But today you can do all that online.,According to a study made by comScore,,online shoppers in the US last year,did more than halfnof their retail purchases online,,and the global market for e-commerce,is estimated to benat two trillion dollars.,And it's expected to reach 2.38nby the end of 2017,,according to eMarketer. 
 Now, from a logistics standpoint,,density is good for deliveries.,Supplying goodsnto a shopping mall is easy.,You can send big shipments to the shop,,and people will go there, pick it upnand take it home themselves.,E-commerce means we need to ship onesies,and have them home delivered.,That's more expensive.,It's like the difference betweennhaving a birthday party for 20 people,or bringing a piece of the cake,to each of your 20 friends at their place.,But at least in the city,,they live close to each other.,Density helps.,Now, e-commerce deliveriesnin the countryside,,those take forever.,The truck sometimes needs to drive milesnbetween one address and the next one.,Those are the most expensivendeliveries of all. 
 But we already have a solution for that:,drones.,A vehicle carrying a squadron of drones.,The driver does some of the deliveries,while the drones are flyingnback and forth from the truck as it moves.,That way, the average costnfor delivery is reduced,,and voila:,affordable e-commerce servicesnin the countryside.,You will see:,the new homes of our teleworkers,will probably havena drone pod in the yard.,So once the final mile deliverynis not a problem,,you don't need to be in the citynto buy things anymore.,So that's two. 
 Now, what was the third reasonnwhy people move to cities?,A rich social life.,They would need to benin the city for that these days.,Because people these days,,they make friends,nthey chat, gossip and flirt,from the comfort of their sofa. 
 (Laughter) 
 And while wearing their favorite pajamas. 
 (Laughter) 
 There are over two billionnactive social media users in the world.,In a way, that makes you thinknlike we are connected,no matter where we are.,But OK, not completely.,Sometimes you still neednsome real human contact.,Ironically, the city,nwith its population density,,is not always the best for that.,Actually, as social groups become smaller,,they grow stronger.,A recent study made in the UK,by the Office for National Statistics,showed a higher life satisfaction rating,among people living in rural areas.,So as people settle in the countryside,,well, they will buy local groceries,,fresh groceries, foodstuff,,maintenance services.,So handymen, small workshops,nservice companies will thrive.,Maybe some of the industrialnworkers from the cities,displaced by the automation,will find a nice alternative job here,,and they will move too.,And as people move to the countryside,,how is that going to be?,Think about autonomous,,off-the-grid houses with solar panels,,with wind turbinesnand waste recycling utilities,,our new homes producing their own energynand using it to also power the family car.,I mean, cities have always been regardednas being more energy-efficient,,but let me tell you,,repopulating the countrysidencan be eco too. 
 By now, you're probably thinkingnof all the advantages of country living. 
 (Laughter) 
 I did it myself.,Six years ago, my wife and I,nwe packed our stuff,,we sold our little apartment in Spain,,and for the same moneynwe bought a house with a garden,and little birds that comensinging in the morning. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's so nice there.,And we live in a small village,nnot really the countryside yet.,That is going to be my next move:,a refurbished farmhouse,,not too far from a city, not too close.,And now we'll make surento have a good spot for drones to land. 
 (Laughter) 
 But hey, that's me.,It doesn't have to be you,,because it would seemnlike I'm trying to convince somebody,to come join us in the country.,I'm not. 
 (Laughter) 
 I don't need more people to come. 
 (Laughter) 
 I just think they will,once they realize they can haventhe same benefits the city has.,But if you don't like the country,,I have good news for you, too.,Cities will not disappear.,But as people move out,,a lower density will help themnrecover a better flow and balance. 
 Anyway, I guess nownyou have some thinking to do.,Do you still thinknyou need to live in the city?,And more importantly,,do you want to? 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Some months back,nI was visiting this East African city,,and we were stuck in traffic.,And this vendor suddenlynapproaches my window,with a half-opened alphabet sheet.,I took a quick look at the alphabet sheet,,and I thought of my daughter,,how it would be nicento spread it on the floor,and just play all over it with her,while getting her to learn the alphabet.,So the traffic moved a bit,nand I quickly grabbed a copy,,and we moved on. 
 When I had time to fully opennthe alphabet sheet,and take a more detailed look at it,,I knew I was not going to use thatnto teach my daughter.,I regretted my purchase.,Why so?,Looking at the alphabet sheetnreminded me of the fact,that not much has changed,in the education curricula in Africa.,Some decades back, I was taughtnout of a similar alphabet sheet.,And because of that,nI struggled for years.,I struggled to reconcile my realitynwith the formal education I received,in school, in the schools I attended.,I had identity crises.,I looked down on my reality.,I looked at my ancestry,nI looked at my lineage with disrespect.,I had very little patiencenfor what my life had to offer around me. 
 Why?,"A is for apple.","A is for apple.","A is for apple" is for that childnin that part of the world,where apples grow out;,who has an apple in her lunch bag;,who goes to the grocery storenwith her mom and sees red,,green, yellow -- applesnof all shapes and colors and sizes.,And so, introducingneducation to this child,with an alphabet sheet like this,fulfills one of the majornfunctions of education,,which is to introduce the learner,to an appreciationnof the learner's environment,and a curiosity to explore morenin order to add value. 
 In my own case,,when and where I grew up in Africa,,apple was an exotic fruit.,Two or three times a year,,I could get some yellowish applesnwith brown dots, you know,,signifying thousands of miles traveled --nwarehouses storing --,to get to me.,I grew up in the city,to very financially comfortable parents,,so it was my dignified reality,,exactly the same way,cassava fufu or ugalinwould not regularly feature,in an American, Chinese or Indian diet,,apples didn't count as part of my reality.,So what this did to me,,introducing education to menwith "A is for apple,",made education an abstraction.,It made it something out of my reach --,a foreign concept,,a phenomenon for which I would havento constantly and perpetually seek,the validation of those it belonged to,for me to make progressnwithin it and with it.,That was tough for a child;nit would be tough for anyone. 
 As I grew up and I advanced academically,,my reality was further separatednfrom my education.,In history, I was taught,that the Scottish explorer Mungo Parkndiscovered the Niger River.,And so it bothered me.,My great-great-grandparents grew up,quite close to the edgenof the Niger River. 
 (Laughter) 
 And it took someone to travelnthousands of miles from Europe,to discover a rivernright under their nose? 
 (Laughter) 
 No! 
 (Applause and cheers) 
 What did they do with their time? 
 (Laughter) 
 Playing board games, roasting fresh yams,,fighting tribal wars?,I mean, I just knew my educationnwas preparing me to go somewhere else,and practice and give to anothernenvironment that it belonged to.,It was not for my environment,nwhere and when I grew up. 
 And this continued.,This philosophy undergirded my studies,all through the time I studied in Africa.,It took a lot of experiencesnand some studies,for me to begin to havena change of mindset.,I will share a couplenof the remarkable ones with us. 
 I was in the United Statesnin Washington, DC,studying towards my doctorate,,and I got this consultancy positionnwith the World Bank Africa Region.,And so I remember one day,,my boss -- we were havingna conversation on some project,,and he mentioned a particularnWorld Bank project,,a large-scale irrigation projectnthat cost millions of dollars,in Niger Republic,that was faltering sustainably.,He said this projectnwasn't so sustainable,,and it bothered thosenthat instituted the whole package.,But then he mentionedna particular project,,a particular traditional irrigation methodnthat was hugely successful,in the same Niger Republicnwhere the World Bank project was failing.,And that got me thinking.,So I did further research,,and I found out about Tassa. 
 Tassa is a traditional irrigation method,where 20- to 30-centimeter-widenand 20- to 30-centimeter-deep holes,are dug across a field to be cultivated.,Then, a small dam is constructednaround the field,,and then crops are plantednacross the surface area.,What happens is that when rain falls,,the holes are able to store the water,and appropriate it to the extentnthat the plant needs the water.,The plant can only assimilatenas much water as needed,until harvest time.,Niger is 75 percent scorched desert,,so this is somethingnthat is a life-or-death situation,,and it has been used for centuries.,In an experiment that was conducted,,two similar plots of landnwere used in the experiment,,and one plot of land,did not have the Tassa technique on it.,Similar plots.,The other one had Tassa techniquenconstructed on it.,Then similar grains of milletnalso were planted on both plots.,During harvest time,,the plot of land without Tassa technique,yielded 11 kilogramsnof millet per hectare.,The plot of land with Tassa technique,yielded 553 kilogramsnof millet per hectare. 
 (Applause) 
 I looked at the research,nand I looked at myself.,I said, "I studiednagriculture for 12 years,,from primary to Senior Six,nas we say in East Africa,,SS3 in West Africa or 12th grade.,No one ever taught me,of any form of traditionalnAfrican knowledge of cultivation --,of harvesting, of anything --,that will work in modern timesnand actually succeed,,where something imported from the Westnwould struggle to succeed.,That was when I knew the challenge,,the challenge of Africa's curricula,,And I thus began my questnto dedicate my life, concern my life work,,to studying, conducting researchnon Africa's own knowledge system,and being able to advocatenfor its mainstreaming,in education, in research, policy,across sectors and industries. 
 Another conversationnand experience I had at the bank,I guess made me take that final decisionnof where I was going to go,,even though it wasn't the most lucrativenresearch to go into,,but it was just about what I believed in.,And so one day, my boss saidnthat he likes to go to Africa,to negotiate World Bank loansnand to work on World Bank projects.,And I was intrigued. I asked him why.,He said, "Oh, when I go to Africa,,it's so easy.,I just write up my loan documentsnand my project proposal in Washington, DC,,I go to Africa, and they allnjust get signed.,I get the best deal, and I'm back to base.,My bosses are happy with me." 
 But then he said,n"I hate going to Asia or ...",and he mentioned a particular country,nAsia and some of these countries.,"They keep me for this, tryingnto get the best deal for their countries.,They get the best deal.,They tell me, 'Oh,nthat clause will not work for us,in our environment.,It's not our reality.nIt's just so Western.',And they tell me, 'Oh,nwe have enough experts,to take care of this.,You don't have enough experts.,We know our aim.',And they just keep goingnthrough all these things.,By the time they finish,nyes, they get the best deal,,but I'm so exhausted and I don't getnthe best deal for the bank,,and we're in business.","Really?" I thought in my head, "OK." 
 I was privileged to sit in onna loan negotiating session,in an African country.,So I would do these consultancynpositions during summer,,you know, since I was a doctoral student.,And then I traveled with the team,nwith the World Bank team,,as more like someone to help outnwith organizational matters.,But I sat in duringnthe negotiating session.,I had mostly Euro-Americans, you know,nwith me from Washington, DC.,And I looked across the tablenat my African brothers and sisters.,I could see intimidation on their faces.,They didn't believenthey had anything to offer,the great-great-grandchildrennof Mungo Park --,the owners of "apple" in "A is for apple.",They just sat and watched:n"Oh, just give us, let us sign.,You own the knowledge. You know it all.,Just, where do we sign?nShow us, let us sign.",They had no voice.nThey didn't believe in themselves. 
 Excuse me. 
 And so,,I have been doing this for a decade.,I have been conducting researchnon Africa's knowledge system,,original, authentic,ntraditional knowledge.,In the few cases where thisnhas been implemented in Africa,,there has been remarkablensuccesses recorded. 
 I think of Gacaca.,Gacaca is Rwanda's traditionalnjudicial system,that was used after the genocide.,In 1994, when the genocide ended,,Rwanda's national court systemnwas in shambles:,no judges, no lawyers to trynhundreds of thousands of genocide cases.,So the government of Rwandancame up with this idea,to resuscitate a traditionalnjudicial system known as Gacaca.,Gacaca is a community-basednjudicial system,,where community members come together,to elect men and women of proven integrity,to try cases of crimes committednwithin these communities.,So by the time Gacaca concludednits trial of genocide cases in 2012,,12,000 community-based courtsnhad tried approximately 1.2 million cases.,That's a record. 
 (Applause) 
 Most importantly is that Gacaca emphasizednRwanda's traditional philosophy,of reconciliation and reintegration,,as against the wholenpunitive and banishment idea,that undergirds present-day Western style.,And not to compare, but just to saynthat it really emphasized,Rwanda's traditional method of philosophy. 
 And so it was Mwalimu Julius Nyerere,,former president of Tanzania -- 
 (Applause) 
 who said that you cannot develop people.,People will have to develop themselves.,I agree with Mwalimu.,I am convinced,that Africa's further transformation,nAfrica's advancement,,rests simply in the acknowledgment,nvalidation and mainstreaming,of Africa's own traditional, authentic,noriginal, indigenous knowledge,in education, in research,nin policy making and across sectors.,This is not going to be easy for Africa.,It is not going to be easy for a peoplenused to being told how to think,,what to do, how to go about it,,a people long subjectednto the intellectual guidance,and direction of others,,be they the colonial masters,,aid industry or international news media.,But it is a task that we have to donto make progress. 
 I am strengthened by the wordsnof Joseph Shabalala,,founder of the South African choral groupnLadysmith Black Mambazo.,He said that the task ahead of usncan never, ever be greater,than the power within us.,We can do it.,We can unlearn looking down on ourselves.,We can learn to place valuenon our reality and our knowledge. 
 Thank you. 
 (Swahili) Thank you very much. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you. Thank you. 
 (Applause)According to the UN,,billions of people still livenwithout an address.,The economist Hernando de Soto said,,"Without an address,,you live outside the law.,You might as well not exist.",I'm here to tell you how my team and Inare trying to change that. 
 If you go to an online mapnand look at a favela in Brazil,or a township in South Africa,,you'll see a few streetsnbut a lot of empty space.,But if you flip to satellite view,,there are thousands of people,nhomes and businesses,in this vast, unmappednand unaddressed spaces.,In Ghana's capital, Accra,,there are numbers and lettersnscrawled onto the sides of walls,,where they piloted address systemsnbut not finished them.,But these places,nthese unaddressed places,,hold huge economic potential. 
 Here's why the issuenof addressing stuck with me.,I worked in the musicnbusiness for 10 years,,and what you may not knownabout the music world,is that every day, people strugglenwith the problems of addressing.,So from the musiciansnwho have to find the gigs,to the production companiesnwho bring the equipment,,everyone somehow always gets lost.,We even had to add someonento our schedules,who was the person you callednwhen you thought you'd arrived,but then realized you hadn't.,And we had some pretty bad days,,like in Italy, where a truck drivernunloaded all the equipment,an hour north of Rome,nnot an hour south of Rome,,and a slightly worse day,where a keyboard playerncalled me and said,,"Chris, don't panic,nbut we may have just sound-checked,at the wrong people's wedding." 
 (Laughter) 
 So not long after the fated Rome event,,I chatted this throughnwith a friend of mine,who is a mathematician,,and we thought it was a problemnwe could do something about.,We thought, well,nwe could make a new system,,but it shouldn't look like the old system.,We agreed that addresses were bad.,We knew we wanted something very precise,,but GPS coordinates,nlatitude and longitude,,were just too complicated. 
 So we divided the worldninto three-meter squares.,The world divides into around 57 trillionnthree-meter squares,,and we found that there arenenough combinations,of three dictionary words,that we could name every three-meternsquare in the world uniquely,with just three words.,We used 40,000 words,,so that's 40,000 cubed,,64 trillion combinations of three words,,which is more than enough fornthe 57-trillion-odd three-meter squares,,with a few spare.,So that's exactly what we did.,We divided the worldninto three-meter squares,,gave each one a unique,nthree-word identifier --,what we call a three-word address.,So for example, right here,,I'm standing at mustards.coupons.pinup, 
 (Laughter) 
 but over here ...,I'm standing at pinched.nsingularly.tutorial. 
 But we haven't just done this in English.,We thought it was essential that peoplenshould be able to use this system,in their own language.,So far, we've built it into 14 languages,,including French, Swahili and Arabic,,and we're working on more now,nlike Xhosa, Zulu and Hindi. 
 But this idea can do a lot more,than just get my musiciansnto their gigs on time.,If the 75 percent of countriesnthat struggle with reliable addressing,started using three-word addresses,,there's a stack of far morenimportant applications.,In Durban, South Africa,,an NGO called Gateway Health,have distributed 11,000nthree-word address signs,to their community,,so the pregnant mothers,nwhen they go into labor,,can call the emergency services,and tell them exactlynwhere to pick them up from,,because otherwise, the ambulancesnhave often taken hours to find them.,In Mongolia, the National Post Servicenhave adopted the system,and are now doing deliveriesnto many people's houses,for the first time.,The UN are using itnto geotag photos in disaster zones,so they can deliver aidnto exactly the right place.,Even Domino's Pizzanare using it in the Caribbean,,because they haven't been ablento find customers' homes,,but they really want to getntheir pizza to them while its still hot. 
 Shortly, you'll be able to get into a car,,speak the three words,,and the car will navigate younto that exact spot.,In Africa, the continentnhas leapfrogged phone lines,to go to mobile phones,,bypassed traditional banksnto go straight to mobile payments.,We're really proud that the post servicesnof three African countries --,Nigeria, Djibouti and Côte d'Ivoire,,have gone straight to adoptingnthree-word addresses,,which means that people in those countries,have a really simple waynto explain where they live, today. 
 For me, poor addressingnwas an annoying frustration,,but for billions of people,,it's a huge business inefficiency,,severely hampersntheir infrastructure growth,,and can cost lives.,We're on a mission to change that,,three words at a time. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)For the last five years,,I have documented the livesnof teenage mothers in Latin America.,I started with a series of photographs,about the moment of birth,in my country, Uruguay. 
 (Video) (Screaming) 
 (Grunting) 
 (Newborn crying) 
 I am the son of a teenage mother,and my sister becamena teenage mother when she was 16.,I began exploring the theme,to better understandnmyself and my origins. 
 In developing countries,,7.3 million girls under the age of 18,give birth each year.,Projections suggest,that the teen pregnancy ratenin Latin America,will be the highest in the world,for the next 80 years.,In Mexico, almost one in twonsexually active adolescents,get pregnant between the agesnof 12 to 19 years old.,Teenage pregnancynis not just about young pregnancies.,It is about gender violence,,physical, symbolic, psychologicalnand economic violence.,Girls who become pregnantnbefore they are 18,rarely achieve an adequatenstandard of living.,The pattern of poverty,and limited accessnto education and health care,are a common threadnamong teen pregnancies.,If a girl in Latin Americangets pregnant before she is 16,,the risk of maternal deathnincreases fourfold,over a woman in their 20s.,And somehow, in spite of all this,,motherhood also imparts a status,and a respect to the adolescentnin her community.,Her child becomes her life project.,A high percentage of girlsnunder the age of 18 are single mothers,,as was my mother. 
 When I was learning to be a parent,,I began to focus on the relationshipnbetween father and child,,a subject rarely given much attention.,I wanted to highlight the ways,in which we neednto educate boys differently,without turning them into macho men.,In some cases, familiesnsend boys to school but not girls.,The persistence of teen pregnancynheightened the gender equity gap,and the continued existencenof traditional roles.,If we were to allownequal opportunities to girls,,they could gain independence.,Educating girls is key,to breaking cycles of teen pregnancies.,Girls getting pregnantnbetween the ages of 10 to 14,are an extremely vulnerable population,,and they can be easy preynfor men twice their age.,There are many cases of violence,,incest and sexual abuse,perpetrated against this group. 
 This is Gloria.,She became a teen mother at the age of 12,,a result of the ongoingnabuse by her father,,who was also raping Gloria's two sisters,,ages 8 and 16.,In this portrait,nshe has butterflies in her hair,,symbols of resurrection.,For me, it's extremely importantnto portray this mother with dignity. 
 Pregnancies among girlsnyounger than 15 is a growing trend,,not only in Latin America,,but many developingncountries in the world.,Our region is marrednby bad social and cultural inequalities,,and teen pregnancynfurther increases this divide.,I am committingnto being part of the solution,by making work that implicitlynand emphatically,calls for human rights for girls.,The day life projectsnfor boys and girls become similar,,teenage pregnancy will decrease. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)We live in a time of fear,,and our response to fearncan either be to contract,and attempt to guard ourselves,or to extend ourselves,nhold on to each other,,and face our fears together.,What is your instinct?,What do you see more of in the world? 
 The problem with the first approach,is that in our mounting isolation,,we divide ourselves from others.,Our sense of isolation grows,,because our imaginationngoes into overdrive,about the people and the spacesnthat we no longer engage with.,Our sense of otherness grows,nand we lose empathy.,Today I'm going to tell younabout a group of people,that took the globalnchallenge of terrorism,and began creating spacesnwhere strangers connect in solidarity. 
 My own obsession with what I seenas irrational divisions began as a child.,As a fourth-generationnKenyan Muslim of Indian origin,,it bothered me that in four generations,,there wasn't a singlenmarriage in my family,outside of my small religious community.,And I wondered what that was about.,Was it fear?,Was it racism?,Was it cultural preservation?,Did it have somethingnto do with colonialism?,Certainly, we didn't share a lotnof the same public spaces with others. 
 These divisions bothered me deeply,nand they drove my career choices.,When I was 20, the US embassiesnin Kenya and Tanzania were bombed.,A year later, I was on my waynto the Middle East,to study conflict resolution.,And then from that point on,,it wasn't very hard for mento find insecure environments to work in,,because the world was quickly shifting,in what we now knownas the time of terrorism.,I was in Washington, DCnwhen 9/11 happened,,and then I moved back homento Kenya to work with refugees,and then later worked in Pakistan,and in Afghanistan.,In all of these places, what I noticed,was how important physical spaces are,to making us feel safe,and well,and like we belong. 
 In 2013, I came back homento Nairobi from Afghanistan.,Al-Shabaab operativesnhad besieged Westgate shopping center,,killing 67 peoplenin a day of utter horror.,Soon after that,,I could see how Nairobinwas beginning to change,,and it was beginning to feelnmore like the fear and terror-weary,and war-torn cities that I had worked in.,And Nairobi continues to grownin fear-driven ways.,We see more walls, more barriers,,more security.,And like other parts of the world,,we are experiencingnan erosion of human connection.,Divisions alongnreligious lines are deepening,,and we're doubting more and morenhow much we have in common.,We are at a pivotal time,when we need to restorenour confidence in humanity,and stand boldly and visibly together. 
 So in 2014, I brought togetherna group of people in Nairobi,to figure out what to do:,public intellectuals, diplomats,nartists, development workers.,And the group articulatednour challenge as threefold:,one, to reclaim the citynfrom the narrative of terrorism,and back into the handsnof the people that live there;,two, introduce a languagenbeyond race, tribe or religion,that would help usntranscend our differences;,and three, provide a gesturenthat would help restore empathy,and conversation and trust. 
 One of the people in this groupnwas an artist and architect,,Yazmany Arboleda.,He and I have collaboratednin other parts of the world,over many years.,He has a history,of disrupting urban environments,and making strangers connect,in incredible, beautifulnand spectacular ways.,He had an idea.,The idea was to unite peoplenof different faiths,by getting them to paintneach other's houses of worship,,mosques, temples, synagogues, churches,,paint them yellow,in the name of love. 
 By focusing on icons of faith,,we would get people to reexaminenthe true essence of their faith,,the common belief that we sharenin kindness, generosity and friendship.,By creating pathwaysnbetween houses of worship,within one neighborhood,,we would create islands of stability,and networks of people,that could withstand threats.,And neighbors, by picking upna paintbrush with other neighbors,,would engage not just with their heads,but with their handsnand with their hearts.,And the painted buildings would becomensculptures in the landscape,that speak of peoplenfrom very different backgrounds,that stand together. 
 We'd call the project "Colour in Faith.",We loved the idea and we immediatelynbegan approaching houses of worship:,churches, temples, mosques, synagogues.,Door to door, we wentnto more than 60 rabbis,,imams, pastors and priests.,As you can imagine,,bringing these communities together,when prejudices are reinforcednby a global pandemic of fear,is not easy.,It was complicated.,We were confrontednwith the hierarchy of decision-making,within religious establishments.,For example, with Catholic churches,,we were told that the archbishopnwould have to make the decision.,And so we wrote a letternto the archbishop.,We wrote a letter to the Vatican.,We're still waiting to hear back. 
 (Laughter) 
 And with other houses of worship,,we were told that the patrons,nthe people that pay for the building,and the constructionnand the painting of the buildings,would have to make a decision. 
 And then we came head-to-head,with the long legacynof missionary and donor dependence,that so impedesnunconditional civic action,,and we learned this the hard way.,There was one community,that in our repeated conversationsnwould keep asking us,to appreciate them.,And so we would keep going back,and telling them that we appreciate them,,and of course,,if we didn't appreciate them,nwe wouldn't be here.,And then we learnednpainfully late in the game,that the word "appreciation"nis code for getting paid to participate.,And so we challenged them,and we asked the question,,"So what will it cost?,How much could we pay you?,And if we pay for your faith,nis it really faith?",We started the projectnasking the question,,"Where does your faith live?",And here we found ourselvesnasking the question,,"How much does your faith cost?" 
 But the most difficult issuenwas the perceived risk of standing apart.,We had one synagoguenthat flat-out refused to participate,because it fearedndrawing attention to itself,and becoming a target.,Similarly, we had a mosquenthat also feared becoming a target.,And these fears are justified.,And yet, there were 25 houses of worshipnthat pledged to participate. 
 (Applause) 
 These bold leaders took the gesturenand reinforced it with their own meaning.,For some, it was to tell the worldnthat they're not terrorists.,For others, it was to welcome peoplenthrough their doors to ask questions.,And for some, it was to bridge the gap,between the oldernand the younger generation,,which by the way is something thatnmany faiths are grappling with right now.,And for some it was simplynto build neighborhood solidarity,in advance of feared election violence.,When asked why yellow,,one imam beautifully said,,"Yellow is the color of the sun.,The sun shines on us all equally.,It does not discriminate.",He and others spread the wordnthrough their congregations,and over the radio.,Municipal government officialsnstepped forward and helped,with permits and with conveningncivil society organizations.,A paint company donatedna thousand liters of yellow paint,mixed especially for usnin what they now call "optimistic yellow." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 And a poetry collectivenjoined forces with a university,and hosted a series of tweet chats,that challenged the nationnon issues of faith,,our faith not justnin the context of religion,,but our faith in politiciansnand tribe and nation,,our faith in the older generationnand in the younger generation. 
 And then Colour in Faithnwas launched at a gallery event,that invited an incredible mixnof gallerygoers,and religious leadersnand artists and businesspeople.,Already, even beforenpicking up a paintbrush,,we had accomplished so muchnof the conversation and connection,that we had hoped for. 
 And then we began to paint.,Muslims stood by Christians,and atheists and agnostics and Hindus,and painted a mosque yellow.,And then they all came together againnand painted a church yellow,,and then another mosque,,and then another church.,Poets and musiciansnperformed while we painted.,We painted in Nairobi,,and then we painted in Mombasa.,The local and international pressndid features on Colour in Faith,in English and French and Swahili,and Spanish and Somali.,CNN highlighted Colour in Faithnas a way of bringing communities together.,And our social media platforms lit up,,connecting more and more people.,And these neighborsncontinued to stay in touch.,There are some that are pursuingnpolitics with a platform of peace,,and we have communitiesnas far as Argentina and the US,and as close as Mali and Rwanda,that are asking for our help.,And we would love to help.,It's our dream that this project,nthis idea, spreads across the world,,with or without our support. 
 Colour in Faith is literally highlightingnthose who mean well in yellow.,Colour in Faith is bindingnneighborhoods together,,and it's our hopenthat when threats come knocking,,they will collectivelynsift fact from rumor,and stand in solidarity.,We've proven that the human familyncan come together and send a message,far brighter and more powerful,than the voices of thosenthat wish to do us harm.,Though fear is infectious,,we are showing that so is hope. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)What stands between Africa's currentnprostrate condition,and a future of prosperity and abundancenfor its long-suffering populations?,One word:,knowledge.,If Africa is to become a continentnthat offers the best life for humans,,it must become a knowledge society,immediately.,This is what I have calledn"Africa's knowledge imperative." 
 Our universities must reduce emphasisnon producing manpower,for running our civil society,,our economy,and our political institutions.,They should be dedicated mainlynto knowledge production.,What sense is therenin producing civil engineers,who are not supportednby soil scientists and geologists,,who make it their businessnto create knowledge about our soil,and our rocks?,What use is there in producing lawyers,without juries who produce knowledge,of the underlying philosophicalnfoundations of the legal system?,We must seek knowledge.,We must approach the matter of knowledge,with a maniacal commitment,,without let or hindrance. 
 Though we must seek knowledgento solve problems we know of,,we must also seek knowledge,when there is no problem in view --,especially when therenis no problem in view.,We must seek to know as muchnof what there is to know of all things,,limited only by the insufficiencynof our human nature,,and not only when the need arises.,Those who do not seek knowledgenwhen it is not needed,will not have it when they must have it. 
 The biggest crisis in Africa todaynis the crisis of knowledge:,how to produce it,,how to manage it,,and how to deploy it effectively.,For instance, Africa does notnhave a water crisis.,It has a knowledge crisisnregarding its water,,where and what types it is,,how it can be tapped and made availablenwhere and when needed to all and sundry.,How does a continent that is home,to some of the largestnbodies of water in the world --,the Nile,,the Niger,,the Congo,,the Zambezi,and the Orange Rivers --,be said to have a water crisis,,including in countries,where those rivers are?,And that is only surface water. 
 While we wrongly dissipate our energiesnfighting the wrong crises,,all those who invest in knowledge about us,are busy figuring outnhow to pipe water from Libya's aquifers,to quench Europe's thirst.,Such is our knowledgenof our water resources,that many of our countries have given up,on making potable water a routine presence,in the lives of Africans,,rich or poor,,high and low,,rural and urban.,We eagerly acceptnwhat the merchants of misery,and the global African Studiesnsafari professoriat,and their aid-addled,,autonomy-fearing African minions,in government, universitiesnand civil society,tell us regarding how naturenhas been to stinting towards Africa,when it comes to the distributionnof water resources in the world.,We are content to run our citiesnand rural dwellings alike,on boreholes.,How does one run metropolisesnon boreholes and wells? 
 Does Africa have a food crisis?,Again, the answer is no.,It is yet another knowledge crisisnregarding Africa's agricultural resources,,what and where they are,,and how they can be best managednto make Africans live more lives,that are worth living.,Otherwise, how does one explain the fact,that geography puts the sourcenof the River Nile in Ethiopia,,and its people cannotnhave water for their lives?,And the same geographynputs California in the desert,,but it is a breadbasket. 
 The difference, obviously,nis not geography.,It is knowledge.,Colorado's aquifers,grow California's pistachios.,Why can't Libya's aquifers,grow sorghum in northern Nigeria?,Why does Nigeria not aspire,to feed the world,,not just itself?,If Africa's land is so poor,nas we are often told,,why are outsiders,,from the United Arab Emiratesnall the way to South Korea,,buying up vast acreages of our land,,to grow food, no less,,to feed their people,in lands that are truly morengeographically stinting?,The new landowners are not planningnto import new topsoil,to make their Africannacquisitions more arable.,Again, a singular instancenof knowledge deficiency. 
 In the 19th century,,our predecessors,,just years removed from the ravagesnof slavery and the slave trade,,were exploring the Niger and Congo Rivers,with a view to turning Africa's resourcesnto the advantage of its people,and to the rest of humanity,,and their 20th-century successorsnwere dreaming of harnessing,the powers of the River Congo,to light up the whole continent.,Now only buccaneer capitalists from Europe,are scheming of doing the same,,but for exports to Europenand South Africa.,And they are even suggesting,that Congolese may notnbenefit from this scheme,,because, according to them,nCongolese communities are too small,to make providing them with electricity,a viable concern. 
 The solution?,Africa must become a knowledge society,,a defining characteristicnof the modern age.,We neither are, nor are wenon the path to becoming,,a knowledge society. 
 Things have not always been this way,when it comes to knowledgenproduction and Africa.,In antiquity, the world went to Africanfor intellectual enrichment.,There were celebrated centers of learning,,attracting questers from all partsnof the then-known world,,seeking knowledge about that world.,What happened thennhas implications for our present.,For example,,how Roman Africa managed the relationshipnbetween settlers and natives,between the second and fourthncenturies of our era,might have something to teach usnwhen it comes to confronting,not-too-dissimilar problemsnat the present time.,But how many classics departmentsndo we have in our universities?,Because we do not invest in knowledge,,people come to Africa now,not as a place of intellectual enrichment,,but as a place where they satentheir thirst for exotica. 
 Yet for the last half-millennium,,Africa has been hemorrhagingnand exporting knowledge,to the rest of the world.,Regardless of the popular descriptionnof it as a trade in bodies,,the European trans-Atlanticnslave trade and slavery,was one of the most radicalnand longest programs,of African brains export in history.,American slave owners may have pretendednthat Africans were mere brutes,,beasts of burden,,almost as inert and dumbnas other farm implements,they classified them withnin their ledgers.,And that's what they did. 
 The enslaved Africans, on the other hand,,knew their were embodiments of knowledge.,They were smiths, they were poets,,they were political counselors,nthey were princes and princesses,,they were mythologists,nthey were herbologists,,they were chefs.,The list is endless.,They, to take a single example,,brought the knowledge of rice cultivation,to the American South.,They created some of the mostnoriginal civilizational elements,for which the United Statesnis now celebrated.,They deployed their knowledge,nfor the most part,,without compensation. 
 For the last half-millennium,nbeginning with the slave trade,,Africa has been exporting brains,while simultaneously breakingnthe chains of knowledge transmission,on the continent itself,,with dire consequences for the systemsnof knowledge production in Africa.,Successive generations are cut offnfrom the intellectual production,of their predecessors.,We keep producing for external markets,while beggaring our own internal needs.,At present,,much of the best knowledge about Africa,is neither produced nor housed there,,even when it is produced by Africans.,Because we are dominatednby immediate needs,and relevant solutions when it comesnto what we should know,,we are happy to hand over to others,the responsibility to produce knowledge,,including knowledge about, of and for us,,and to do so far away from us.,We are ever eager to consume knowledge,and have but a mere portion of it,without any anxiety aboutnownership and location.,African universitiesnare now all too content,to have e-connectionsnwith libraries elsewhere,,having given up ambitionsnon building libraries,to which the world would comenfor intellectual edification.,Control over who decidesnwhat should be stocked on our shelves,and how access to collectionsnshould be determined,are made to rest on our trustnin our partners' good faith,that they will not abandon usndown the road. 
 This must change.,Africa must becomena place of knowledge again.,Knowledge productionnactually expands the economy.,Take archaeological digs, for instance,,and their impact on tourism.,Our desires to unearth our antiquity,,especially those remote timesnof which we have no written records,,requires investment in archaeologynand related disciplines,,e.g., paleoanthropology.,Yet, although it is our pastnwe seek to know,,by sheer serendipity,,archaeology may shed lightnon the global human experience,and yield economic payoffs,that were no partnof the original reasons for digging. 
 We must find a way to make knowledgenand its production sexy and rewarding;,rewarding, not in the crassnsense of moneymaking,but in terms of making it worthwhilento indulge in the pursuit of knowledge,,support the existence,of knowledge-producingngroups and intellectuals,,ensuring that the continent,becomes the immediate locusnof knowledge production,,distribution and consumption,,and that instead of havingnits depositories,beyond Africa's boundaries,,people once more comenfrom the rest of the world,,even if in virtual space,nto learn from us.,All this we do as custodiansnon behalf of common humanity. 
 Creating a knowledge society in Africa,,for me, would be one way to celebratenand simultaneously enhance diversity,by infinitely enriching it with materialnand additional artifacts --,artifacts that we furnish,by our strivings,in the knowledge field. 
 Thank you very much. 
 (Applause)Cities are like siblingsnin a large polygamous family.,Each one has a unique personalitynand is headed in a distinct direction.,But they all have somewhat shared origins.,Sometimes I think postcolonial citiesnare like the children,of the two least-favorite wives,,who are constantly being asked,,"Ah, why can't you benmore like your sister?" 
 (Laughter) 
 The "why" of cities is largely the same,nno matter where they are:,an advantageous location that makesntrade and administration possible;,the potential for scalable opportunities,for the skilled and unskilled alike;,a popular willingnessnto be in constant flux,and, of course, resilience.,The "how" of cities, however,nis a whole other story.,How are they run?,How do they grow?,How do they decide who belongsnand who doesn't? 
 Lagos is my home.,You can always find the Nigerians,by following the noisenand the dancing, right? 
 (Laughter) 
 Like any major city,nthat place is a lot of things,,many of which are highly contradictory.,Our public transportationndoesn't quite work,,so we have these privately ownednbright yellow buses,that regularly cause accidents.,Luxury car showrooms line badly maintainednand often flooded roads.,Street evangelism is onlynslightly less ubiquitous,than street harassment.,Sex workers sometimesnhave two degrees, a bank job,and a prominent role in church. 
 (Laughter) 
 On any given day,,there can be either a partynor a burned body,in the middle of a street. 
 There is so much that is possible in Lagos,and so much that isn't,,and very often the differencenbetween possibility and impossibility,is simply who you are,,and if you're lucky enough,nwho you're connected to.,Belonging in Lagos is a fluid concept,determined by ethnic origin,nsexual orientation, gender,,but most visibly and often most violently,,class. 
 Before Nigeria became a country,,fisherpeople from the inland creeksnstarted to come down the Lagos lagoon,and establish villages along the coast.,About 60 years later, my grandfather,nOludotun Adekunle Kukoyi,,also arrived in Lagos.,Like me, he was an alumnusnof the University of Ibadan,,a young member of the educated elitenin the independence era.,Over time, he built an illustrious careernas a land surveyor,,mapping out now-bustling neighborhoods,when they were just waist-high wild grass.,He died when I was nine.,And by that time, my family,nlike the families of those fisherpeople,,knew Lagos as home. 
 Among the Yoruba, we have a saying,,"Èkó gb’olè, ó gb’ọ̀lẹ,",which can be translated to meannthat Lagos will welcome anyone.,But that saying is becomingnless and less true.,Many Lagosians, includingnthe descendants of those fisherpeople,who arrived generationsnbefore my grandfather,,are now being pushed out,to make room for an emergent city,that has been describednas "the new Dubai.",You see, Lagos inspires big dreams,neven in its leaders,,and successive governmentsnhave declared aspirations,towards a megacitynwhere poverty does not exist.,Unfortunately, instead of focusingnon the eradication of poverty,as you would expect,,the strategy of choice focusesnon eliminating the poor. 
 Last October, the Governor announced plans,to demolish every singlenwaterfront settlement in Lagos.,There are more than 40nof these indigenous communities,all over the city,,with over 300,000 people living in them.,Otodo Gbame,,a hundred-year-old fishing village,with a population aboutnthree-quarters that of Monaco,and similar potentialnfor beachfront luxury -- 
 (Laughter) 
 was one of the first to be targeted. 
 I first heard of Otodo Gbamenafter the demolition started.,When I visited in November 2016,nI met Magdalene Aiyefoju.,She is a now-homeless woman,whose surname means, "the world is blind.",Magdalene's son Basilnwas one of over 20 people,who were shot, drowned,or presumed dead in that land grab.,Standing outside her shelter,nI saw the two white-sand football fields,where Basil used to play.,Spread all around us were the ruinsnof schools, churches,,a primary health center, shops,,thousands of homes.,Young children enthusiastically helpednto put up shelters,,and about 5,000 of the residents,nwith nowhere else to go,,simply stayed put.,And then in April,,state security personnel came back.,This time, they clearednthe community out completely,,with beatings, bullets and fire.,As I speak, there are construction crewsnpreparing Otodo Gbame's beaches,for anyone who can affordna multi-million-dollar view.,The new developmentnis called "Periwinkle Estate." 
 Forced evictions are incredibly violentnand, of course, unconstitutional.,And yet, they happen so oftennin so many of our cities,,because the first thing we are taughtnto forget about poor people,is that they are people.,We believe that a home is a thingna person absolutely has a right to,,unless the person is poornand the home is built a certain way,in a certain neighborhood.,But there is no single definitionnof the word "home.",After all, what is a slumnbesides an organic response,to acute housing deficitsnand income inequality?,And what is a shanty if not a personnmaking a home for themselves,against all odds?,Slums are an imperfect housing solution,,but they are also prime examplesnof the innovation, adaptability,and resilience at the foundation --,and the heart --,of every functional city.,You don't need to be the new Dubai,when you're already Lagos. 
 (Applause) 
 We have our own identity,,our own rhythm,,and as anyone who knowsnLagos can tell you,,poor Lagosians are very oftennthe source of the city's character.,Without its poor, Lagos would notnbe known for its music,or its endless energy,or even the fact that you can buynan ice cold drink or a puppy,through your car window. 
 (Laughter) 
 The conditions that cause usnto define certain neighborhoods as slums,can be effectively improved,,but not without recognizingnthe humanity and the agency,of the people living in them.,In Lagos, where public goodsnare rarely publicly available,,slum dwellers are often at the forefrontnof innovating solutions.,After being disconnectednfrom the grid for months,because the power companyncouldn't figure out how to collect bills,,one settlement designed a systemnthat collectivized remittances,and got everyone cheaper ratesninto the bargain.,Another settlement createdna reform program,that hires local bad boys as security.,They know every trick and every hideout,,so now troublemakers are more likelynto get caught and reported to police,and fewer of the youth end upnengaging in criminal activity.,Yet another settlement recently completed,a flood-safe, eco-friendlyncommunal toilet system.,Models like these are beingnadopted across Lagos. 
 Informal settlements are incorrectlynnamed as the problem.,In fact, the real problemsnare the factors that create them,,like the entrenchment of poverty,,social exclusion,and state failures.,When our governmentsnframe slums as threats,in order to justify violent land grabsnor forced evictions,,they're counting on those of usnwho live in formal housing,to tacitly and ignorantly agree with them.,Rather, we must remind them,that governments exist to servennot only those who build,and live in luxury homes,,but also those who clean and guard them.,Our -- 
 (Applause) 
 our realities may differ,,but our rights don't. 
 The Lagos state government,,like far too many on our continent,,pays lip service to ideas of inclusion,,while acting as thoughnprogress can only be achieved,by the erasure, exploitationnand even elimination of groups,it considers expendable.,People living with disabilitiesnwho hawk or beg on Lagos streets,are rounded up, extorted,and detained.,Women in low-incomenneighborhoods are picked up,and charged with prostitution,,regardless of what they actuallyndo for a living.,Gay citizens are scapegoatednto distract from real political problems.,But people, like cities, are resilient,,and no amount of legislationnor intimidation or violence,can fully eliminate any of us.,Prostitutes, womennand women who work as prostitutes,still haven't gone extinct,,despite centuries of active suppression.,Queer Africans continue to exist,,even though queerness is now criminalizednin most parts of the continent.,And I'm fairly certain that poor peoplendon't generally tend to just disappear,because they've been strippednof everything they have. 
 We are all already here,,and that answers the question,of whether or not we belong. 
 When those fisherpeoplenstarted to sail down the lagoon,in search of new homes,,it could not have occurred to them,that the city that wouldnrise up around them,would one day insistnthat they do not belong in it.,I like to believe that my grandfather,,in mapping new frontiers for Lagos,,was trying to open it up,to make room for other peoplento be welcomed by the city,in the same way that he was.,On my way here, my grandma called me,to remind me how proud she was,,how proud [my grandfather]nand my mother would have been.,I am their dreams come true.,But there is no reason why their dreams --nor mine, for that matter --,are allowed to come true,while those of othersnare turned to nightmares.,And lest we forget:,the minimum requirement for a dream,is a safe place to lay your head. 
 It is too late now for Basil,,but not for Magdalene,,not for the hundreds of thousands,,the millions still under threat in Lagos,or any of our cities.,The world does not have to remain blind,to the suffering that is creatednwhen we deny people's humanity,,or even to the incredible potentialnfor growth that exists,when we recognize and valuenall contributions. 
 We must hold our governments,and ourselves,accountable,for keeping our shared cities safenfor everyone in them,,because the only cities worth building --,indeed, the only futuresnworth dreaming of --,are those that include all of us,,no matter who we are,or how we make homes for ourselves. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I was born and raised in Dakar, Senegal,,and through a combinationnof accidents and cosmic justice,,became a chef in the US. 
 (Laughter) 
 When I first arrived in New York,,I began working in these restaurants --ndifferent types of restaurants --,from French bistro to Italian,,global ethnic to modern American.,At the time,,New York was already well-establishednas a food capital of the world.,However ...,with the exception of a few West Africannand Ethiopian mom-and-pop eateries,,there was no such thingnas African cuisine in the entire city. 
 Early in my life,,I was influencednby Senegal's first president,,Léopold Sédar Senghor,,nicknamed, "the poet president,",who talked about a new humanism,,a universal civilization,,in which all cultures would come togethernaround a communal table as equals,,each bringing its own beautifulncontribution to share.,He called it "the rendezvousnof giving and receiving.",That concept resonated with me,,and it has guided my career path. 
 After years of working in restaurants,,I yearned for my worknto have a deeper impact,that would go beyondnthe last meal I had served.,I wanted to give back, both to New York --,the city that allowed menthe opportunity to follow my calling --,but also to my originsnand ancestors in Senegal.,I wanted to contributento that universal civilization,Senghor had described.,But I didn't know how to makena measurable impact,as a cook and writer. 
 While I was writing my first cookbook,,I often traveled to different regionsnof Senegal for research.,During one of those trips,,in the remote, southeastnregion of Kédougou,I rediscoverednan ancient grain called fonio,that had all but disappearednfrom the urban Senegalese diet.,It turns out that fonionhad been cultivated,for more than five thousand years,and is probably the oldestncultivated cereal in Africa.,Once a popular grainnon much of the continent,,fonio was grownnall the way to ancient Egypt,,where archaeologists found grainsninside pyramids' burial grounds.,Today it is mostly cultivatednin the western part of the Sahel region,,from Senegal to Mali,,Burkina Faso,,Togo, Nigeria.,The Sahel region is that semiarid areansouth of the Sahara desert,that extends from the Atlanticnin the west to the Red Sea in the east.,I became more interested in this grain,that was deemed worth takingnto the afterlife by early Egyptians. 
 As I continued my research,,I found out that fonio was actually --,wherever it was cultivated --,there was always some myth,nor some superstition connected to it.,The Dogon,,another great culture in Mali,,called it "po,",or, "the seed of the universe.",In that ancient culture's mythology,,the entire universensprouted from a seed of fonio. 
 Aside from its purportednmystical properties,,fonio is a miracle grain in many aspects.,It is nutritious,,particularly richnin methionine and cysteine,,two amino acids that are deficientnin most other major grains:,barley, rice or wheat to name a few.,In addition,,fonio cultivationnis great for the environment.,It tolerates poor soil,and needs very little water,,surviving where nothing else will grow. 
 As a chef,,what first struck me wasnits delicate taste and its versatility.,Similar to couscous,,fonio has a delicious,nnutty and earthy flavor.,It can be turned into salad,,served as noodles,,used in baking,or simply as a substitute for anynother grains in your favorite recipes.,I am happy to share some of mynfonio sushi and sweet potato sushi,with some of you right now. 
 (Audience) Oh! 
 (Applause) 
 And okra. 
 (Audience murmurs) 
 In Kédougou,it is also nicknamed "ñamu buur,",which means "food for royalty,",and it's served for guests of honor. 
 Located at the bordernwith Guinea and Mali,,Kédougou first strikes visitorsnwith its stunning vistas,and views of the Fouta Djallon Mountains.,Sadly, it is also one of the poorestnregions of Senegal.,Because of desertificationnand lack of job prospects,,much of Kédougou'snyoung population has left.,They chose the deadly path of migration,in search of "better" opportunities.,Often,,they risk their livesntrying to reach Europe.,Some leave by crossing the Sahara desert.,Others end up on inadequate wooden canoes,in desperate attempts to reach Spain.,According to a recent "Guardian" article,,by 2020 more that 60 million peoplenfrom sub-Saharan Africa,are expected to migrate,due to desertification.,This is the biggest global wavenof migration since the Second World War,,and it's only set to grow.,So far this year,,more that 2,100 migrantsnhave lost their lives,on their way to Europe.,This is the reality of Kédougou,and of much of the Sahel today.,Scary future,,scarce food,and no opportunitiesnto change their situation. 
 If life in your villagenweren't so precarious,,if there was a waynto having enough food to get by,,or having a paying job --,if you and your sisters,didn't have to spendn30 percent of their waking hours,fetching water,,if conditions were justna little more hospitable ...,could the solutionnbe right here in our soil?,Could bringing fonionto the rest of the world,be the answer? 
 Ancient grains are getting more popular,,and sales of gluten-free itemsnare growing in the US --,16.4 percent since 2013,,making it a 23.3-billion-dollar industry.,How could fonionpartake in this market share? 
 There are many challengesnin turning fonio into food.,Traditional processingnis laborious and time-consuming,,especially when compared to other grains.,Well, thankfully, technology has evolved.,And there are now machines,that can process fonionin a more efficient way.,And as a matter of fact,,a few years ago,,Sanoussi Diakité,,a Senegalese engineer,,won a Rolex prize,for his invention of the firstnmechanized fonio processor.,Today, such machines are making lifenmuch easier for producers,around the whole Sahel region. 
 Another challengenis the colonial mentality,that what comes from the west is best.,This tendency to look downnon our own products,and to see crops like fonionas simply "country peoples' food,",therefore substandard,,explains why even though we don'tnproduce wheat in Senegal traditionally,,it is far easier to find baguettesnor croissants in the streets of Dakar,than it is to find any fonio products.,This same mindset popularizednthe overprocessed, leftover rice debris,known as "broken rice,",which was imported to Senegalnfrom Indochina,and introduced by the colonial French.,Soon, broken rice becamena key ingredient in our national dish,,thiéboudienne,,replacing our own traditional,nmore nutritious African rice,,Oryza glaberrima.,Ironically, the same African ricendespised at home,was hailed abroad.,Indeed, during the Atlantic slave trade,,this rice becamena major crop in the Americas ...,particularly in the Carolinas,where it was nicknamed, "Carolina gold." 
 But let's return to fonio.,How can we turn its current statusnof "country-people food",into a world-class crop?,Last year,,a business partner and I securedna commitment from Whole Foods Market,,the US's largest natural food store chain,,to carry fonio.,And we got a largenAmerican ingredient importer,interested enoughnto send a team of executives,to West Africa with us,to explore the supply chain's viability.,We found ourselvesnobserving manual operations,in remote locations,with few controls over quality.,So we started focusingnon processing issues.,We drew up a vision,with a beneficial and commerciallynsustainable supply chain for fonio,,and we connected ourselvesnwith organizations,that can help us achieve it. 
 Walking backwards from the market,nhere is what it looks like.,Imagine that fonionis consumed all across the globe,as other popular ancient grains.,Fonio touted on the levels of cereals,,breads,,nutrition bars,,cookies, pastas,,snacks -- why not?,It's easier to say than quinoa. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 To get there,,fonio needs to be readily available,at a consistent qualitynfor commercial users,,such as food manufacturersnand restaurant chains.,That's the part we're missing.,To make fonio availablenat a consistent quality,for commercial use,,you need a commercial-scale fonio mill,that adheres to internationalnquality standards.,Currently, there is no such millnin the whole world,,so in our vision,,there is an African-ownednand operated fonio mill,that processes efficiently,and in compliance with the requirementsnof multinational food companies.,It is very difficultnfor the fonio producers today,to sell and use fonio,unless they devotena huge amount of time and energy,in threshing, winnowing and husking it.,In our vision,,the mill will take on those tasks,,allowing the producers to focusnon farming rather than processing. 
 There is untappednagricultural capacity in the Sahel,,and all it takesnis changing market conditions,to activate that capacity.,By relieving fonio producersnof manual operations,,the mill will free up their time,and remove the production bottlenecknthat limits their output.,And there are other benefits as well,in using Sahel land for agriculture.,More benefits,,higher employment,,climate change mitigationnby reversing desertification,and greater food security.,Nice vision, right?,Well, we are workingntowards getting it done.,Last month we introduced fonionto shoppers in New York City,and online,,in a package that makes it attractivenand desirable and accessible. 
 (Applause) 
 We are talking with operatorsnand investors in West Africa,about building a fonio mill.,And most importantly,,we have teamed with an NGOncalled SOS SAHEL,to recruit, train and equipnsmallholders in the Sahel,to increase their fonio production. 
 Hunger levels are highernin sub-Saharan Africa,than any other place in the world.,The Sahel population is set to grow,from 135 million to 340 million people.,However, in that drought-nand famine-prone region,,fonio grows freely.,This tiny grain may provide big answers,,reasserting its Dogon name,,"po," the seed of the universe,,and taking us one step closer,to the universal civilization. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Since 2009, the world has been stuck,on a single narrativenaround a coming global food crisis,and what we need to do to avoid it.,How do we feednnine billion people by 2050?,Every conference, podcastnand dialogue around global food security,starts with this question,and goes on to answer it,by saying we need to producen70 percent more food. 
 The 2050 narrative started to evolve,shortly after global food pricesnhit all-time highs in 2008.,People were suffering and struggling,,governments and world leaders,needed to show usnthat they were paying attention,and were working to solve it.,The thing is, 2050nis so far into the future,that we can't even relate to it,,and more importantly,,if we keep doing what we're doing,,it's going to hit usna lot sooner than that. 
 I believe we need to askna different question.,The answer to that question,needs to be framed differently.,If we can reframe the old narrative,and replace it with new numbers,that tell us a more complete pictures,,numbers that everyone can understand,and relate to,,we can avoid the crisis altogether. 
 I was a commodities trader in my past life,and one of the thingsnthat I learned trading,is that every market has a tipping point,,the point at whichnchange occurs so rapidly,that it impacts the world,and things change forever.,Think of the last financial crisis,,or the dot-com crash. 
 So here's my concern.,We could have a tipping point,in global food and agriculture,if surging demand,surpasses the agricultural system'snstructural capacity to produce food.,This means at this point supplyncan no longer keep up with demand,despite exploding prices,,unless we can commitnto some type of structural change.,This time around,,it won't be about stock markets and money.,It's about people.,People could starvenand governments may fall.,This question of at what pointndoes supply struggle,to keep up with surging demand,is one that started off as an interestnfor me while I was trading,and became an absolute obsession.,It went from interest to obsession,when I realized through my researchnhow broken the system was,and how very little data was being usednto make such critical decisions.,That's the point I decided to walk awaynfrom a career on Wall Street,and start an entrepreneurial journey,to start Gro Intelligence. 
 At Gro, we focus on bringing this data,and doing the work to make it actionable,,to empower decision-makers at every level.,But doing this work,,we also realized that the world,,not just world leaders,,but businesses and citizensnlike every single person in this room,,lacked an actionable guide,on how we can avoidna coming global food security crisis.,And so we built a model,,leveraging the petabytesnof data we sit on,,and we solved for the tipping point. 
 Now, no one knowsnwe've been working on this problem,and this is the first timenthat I'm sharing what we discovered.,We discovered that the tipping pointnis actually a decade from now.,We discovered that the world,will be short 214 trillion calories,by 2027.,The world is not in a positionnto fill this gap. 
 Now, you'll notice,that the way I'm framing thisnis different from how I started,,and that's intentional, because until now,this problem has beennquantified using mass:,think kilograms, tons, hectograms,,whatever your unit of choice is in mass.,Why do we talk about foodnin terms of weight?,Because it's easy.,We can look at a photographnand determine tonnage on a ship,by using a simple pocket calculator.,We can weigh trucks,nairplanes and oxcarts.,But what we care aboutnin food is nutritional value.,Not all foods are created equal,,even if they weigh the same.,This I learned firsthand,when I moved from Ethiopianto the US for university.,Upon my return back home,,my father, who was so excited to see me,,greeted me by asking why I was fat.,Now, turns out that eating,approximately the same amount of foodnas I did in Ethiopia, but in America,,had actually lentna certain fullness to my figure.,This is why we should care about calories,,not about mass.,It is calories which sustain us. 
 So 214 trillion caloriesnis a very large number,,and not even the most dedicated of us,think in the hundredsnof trillions of calories.,So let me break this down differently.,An alternative way to think about this,is to think about it in Big Macs.,214 trillion calories.,A single Big Mac has 563 calories.,That means the world will be shortn379 billion Big Macs in 2027.,That is more Big Macsnthan McDonald's has ever produced. 
 So how did we getnto these numbers in the first place?,They're not made up.,This map shows younwhere the world was 40 years ago.,It shows you net calorie gapsnin every country in the world.,Now, simply put,,this is just caloriesnconsumed in that country,minus calories producednin that same country.,This is not a statementnon malnutrition or anything else.,It's simply saying how many caloriesnare consumed in a single year,minus how many are produced.,Blue countries are net calorie exporters,,or self-sufficient.,They have some in storage for a rainy day.,Red countries are net calorie importers.,The deeper, the brighter the red,,the more you're importing.,40 years ago, such few countriesnwere net exporters of calories,,I could count them with one hand.,Most of the African continent,,Europe, most of Asia,,South America excluding Argentina,,were all net importers of calories.,And what's surprising is that Chinanused to actually be food self-sufficient.,India was a big net importer of calories. 
 40 years later, this is today.,You can see the drastic transformationnthat's occurred in the world.,Brazil has emergednas an agricultural powerhouse.,Europe is dominant in global agriculture.,India has actually flippednfrom red to blue.,It's become food self-sufficient.,And China went from that light blue,to the brightest rednthat you see on this map. 
 How did we get here? What happened?,So this chart shows you India and Africa.,Blue line is India, red line is Africa.,How is it that two regionsnthat started off so similarly,in such similar trajectories,take such different paths?,India had a green revolution.,Not a single African countrynhad a green revolution.,The net outcome?,India is food self-sufficient,and in the past decadenhas actually been exporting calories.,The African continent now importsnover 300 trillion calories a year.,Then we add China, the green line.,Remember the switchnfrom the blue to the bright red?,What happened and when did it happen?,China seemed to benon a very similar path to India,until the start of the 21st century,,where it suddenly flipped.,A young and growing population,combined with significant economic growth,made its mark with a big bang,and no one in the markets saw it coming.,This flip was everythingnto global agricultural markets.,Luckily now, South America,was starting to boomnat the same time as China's rise,,and so therefore, supply and demandnwere still somewhat balanced. 
 So the question becomes,,where do we go from here?,Oddly enough,,it's not a new story,,except this timenit's not just a story of China.,It's a continuation of China,,an amplification of Africa,and a paradigm shift in India.,By 2023,,Africa's population is forecastednto overtake that of India's and China's.,By 2023, these three regions combined,will make up over halfnthe world's population.,This crossover point starts to presentnreally interesting challenges,for global food security.,And a few years later,nwe're hit hard with that reality. 
 What does the world look like in 10 years?,So far, as I mentioned,nIndia has been food self-sufficient.,Most forecasters predictnthat this will continue.,We disagree.,India will soon becomena net importer of calories.,This will be driven both by the fact,that demand is growingnfrom a population growth standpoint,plus economic growth.,It will be driven by both.,And even if you havenoptimistic assumptions,around production growth,,it will make that slight flip.,That slight flipncan have huge implications. 
 Next, Africa will continuento be a net importer of calories,,again driven by population growthnand economic growth.,This is again assuming optimisticnproduction growth assumptions.,Then China,,where population is flattening out,,calorie consumption will explode,because the types of calories consumed,are also starting to benhigher-calorie-content foods.,And so therefore,,these three regions combined,start to present a really interestingnchallenge for the world. 
 Until now, countries with calorie deficits,have been able to meet these deficits,by importing from surplus regions.,By surplus regions, I'm talking about,North America, South America and Europe.,This line chart over here shows you,the growth and the projected growthnover the next decade of production,from North America,nSouth America and Europe.,What it doesn't show you,is that most of this growth is actuallyngoing to come from South America.,And most of this growth,is going to comenat the huge cost of deforestation.,And so when you looknat the combined demand increase,coming from India, Chinanand the African continent,,and look at it versusnthe combined increase in production,coming from India,nChina, the African continent,,North America, South America and Europe,,you are left withna 214-trillion-calorie deficit,,one we can't produce.,And this, by the way, is actually assumingnwe take all the extra calories,produced in North America,nSouth America and Europe,and export them solelynto India, China and Africa. 
 What I just presented to younis a vision of an impossible world.,We can do something to change that.,We can change consumption patterns,,we can reduce food waste,,or we can make a bold commitment,to increasing yields exponentially. 
 Now, I'm not going to go into discussing,changing consumption patternsnor reducing food waste,,because those conversationsnhave been going on for some time now.,Nothing has happened.,Nothing has happenednbecause those arguments,ask the surplus regionsnto change their behavior,on behalf of deficit regions.,Waiting for othersnto change their behavior,on your behalf, for your survival,,is a terrible idea.,It's unproductive. 
 So I'd like to suggest an alternativenthat comes from the red regions.,China, India, Africa.,China is constrained in termsnof how much more land it actually has,available for agriculture,,and it has massivenwater resource availability issues.,So the answer really liesnin India and in Africa.,India has some upsidenin terms of potential yield increases.,Now this is the gapnbetween its current yield,and the theoreticalnmaximum yield it can achieve.,It has some unfarmednarable land remaining, but not much,,India is quite land-constrained.,Now, the African continent,non the other hand,,has vast amounts of arable land remaining,and significantnupside potential in yields.,Somewhat simplified picture here,,but if you look at sub-SaharannAfrican yields in corn today,,they are where North Americannyields were in 1940.,We don't have 70-plus yearsnto figure this out,,so it means we need to try something new,and we need to try something different.,The solution starts with reforms.,We need to reform and commercialize,the agricultural industries in Africa,and in India. 
 Now, by commercialization --,commercialization is notnabout commercial farming alone.,Commercialization is about leveraging data,to craft better policies,,to improve infrastructure,,to lower the transportation costs,and to completely reformnbanking and insurance industries.,Commercializationnis about taking agriculture,from too risky an endeavornto one where fortunes can be made.,Commercializationnis not about just farmers.,Commercialization is aboutnthe entire agricultural system.,But commercializationnalso means confronting the fact,that we can no longer placenthe burden of growth,on small-scale farmers alone,,and accepting that commercial farmsnand the introduction of commercial farms,could provide certain economies of scale,that even small-scalenfarmers can leverage.,It is not about small-scale farmingnor commercial agriculture,,or big agriculture.,We can create the first successful modelsnof the coexistence and success,of small-scale farmingnalongside commercial agriculture.,This is because, for the first time ever,,the most critical toolnfor success in the industry --,data and knowledge --,is becoming cheaper by the day.,And very soon, it won't matternhow much money you have,or how big you are,to make optimal decisionsnand maximize probability of success,in reaching your intended goal.,Companies like Gro are workingnreally hard to make this a reality. 
 So if we can commitnto this new, bold initiative,,to this new, bold change,,not only can we solventhe 214-trillion gap that I talked about,,but we can actually set the worldnon a whole new path.,India can remain food self-sufficient,and Africa can emergenas the world's next dark blue region. 
 The new question is,,how do we produce 214 trillion calories,to feed 8.3 billion people by 2027?,We have the solution.,We just need to act on it. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'd like for you to take a momentnto imagine this with me.,You're a little girl of five years old.,Sitting in front of a mirror,,you ask yourself,,"Do I exist?",In this space, there isnvery little context,,and so you move into a different one,,one filled with people.,Surely, now you know you're notna figment of your own imagination.,You breathe their air.,You see them,,so they must see you.,And yet, you still can't help but wonder:,Do I only exist when people speak to me? 
 Pretty heavy thoughts for a child, right?,But through various artworksnthat reflect upon our society,,I came to understandnhow a young black girl can grow up,feeling as if she's not seen,nand perhaps she doesn't exist.,You see, if young people don't havenpositive images of themselves,and all that remainsnare negative stereotypes,,this affects their self-image.,But it also affects the waynthat the rest of society treats them. 
 I discovered this,having lived in Cape Townnfor about five years at the time.,I felt a deep sensenof dislocation and invisibility.,I couldn't see myself represented.,I couldn't see the women who've raised me,,the ones who've influenced me,,and the ones that have madenSouth Africa what it is today.,I decided to do something about it. 
 What do you think when you see this?,If you were a black girl,,how would it make you feel?,Walking down the street,,what does the city you live in say to you?,What symbols are present?,Which histories are celebrated?,And on the other hand,,which ones are omitted? 
 You see, public spaces are hardlynever as neutral as they may seem.,I discovered this when I madenthis performance in 2013 on Heritage Day.,Cape Town is teemingnwith masculine architecture,,monuments and statues,,such as Louis Botha in that photograph.,This overt presence of white colonialnand Afrikaner nationalist men,not only echoes a social,ngender and racial divide,,but it also continues to affectnthe way that women --,and the way, particularly, black women --,see themselves in relationnto dominant male figures,in public spaces.,For this reason, among others,,I don't believe that we need statues.,The preservation of historynand the act of remembering,can be achieved in more memorablenand effective ways. 
 As part of a year-longnpublic holiday series,,I use performance artnas a form of social commentary,to draw people's attentionnto certain issues,,as well as addressing the absencenof the black female body,in memorialized public spaces,,especially on public holidays.,Women's Day was coming up.,I looked at what the day means --,the Women's Marchnto the union buildings in 1956,,petitioning against the pass laws.,Juxtaposed with the hypocrisynof how women are treated,,especially in public spaces today,,I decided to do something about it. 
 Headline: 
 [Women in miniskirt attacked at taxi rank] 
 How do I comment on such polar opposites?,In the guise of my great-grandmother,,I performed bare-breasted,,close to the taxi rank in KwaLanga.,This space is also called Freedom Square,,where women were a part of demonstrationsnagainst apartheid laws.,I was not comfortable with womennbeing seen as only victims in society.,You might wondernhow people reacted to this. 
 (Video) Woman: (Cheering) 
 Woman 2 (offscreen): Yes! 
 Sethembile Msezane: Pretty cool, huh? 
 (Applause) 
 So I realized that throughnmy performances,,I've been able to make regular peoplenreflect upon their society,,looking at the pastnas well as the current democracy. 
 (Video) Man (offscreen):nShe's been there since three o'clock. 
 Man 2 (offscreen): Just before three.nAbout an hour still? 
 Man 1: Yeah. It's just a really hot day. 
 Man 1: It's very interesting.,It's very powerful.,I think it's cool.,I think a lot of peoplenare quick to join a group,that's a movement towards something,,but not many people are readynto do something as an individual. 
 Man 2: So it's the individualnversus the collective. 
 Man 1: Yeah.,So I think her pushing her ownnindividual message in performance ...,it's powerful.,Yeah, I think it's quite powerfulnthat she's doing it on her own.,I'd be interested to know whynshe's using hair extensions as wings,,or whatever those things are meant to be.,They are wings, yes? 
 Woman 3: With her standingnthere right now,,I think it's just my interpretation,that we are bringing the statue down,and bringing up something,that's supposed to representnAfrican pride, I think.,Or something like that.,Something should stand while Rhodes falls,,I think that's what it's saying. Yeah.,Yes. Thank you. 
 Man 3: What is behind menrepresents the African culture.,We can't have the colonialist law,,so we need to removenall these colonial statues.,We have have our own statues now,,our African leaders --nBhambatha, Moshoeshoe, Kwame Nkrumah --,all those who paid their livesnfor our liberation.,We can't continue in the 21st century,,and after 21 years of democracy,,have the colonizers in our own country.,They belong somewhere.nMaybe in a museum; not here.,I mean learning institutions,nplaces where young people,,young minds are being shaped.,So we cannot continue to have Louis Botha,nRhodes, all these people,,because they're representingnthe colonialism. 
 (Applause) 
 Sethembile Msezane: On April 9, 2015,,the Cecil John Rhodes statuenwas scheduled to be removed,after a month of debatesnfor and against its removal,by various stakeholders.,This caused a widespread interestnin statues in South Africa.,Opinions varied, but the medianfocused on problematizing,the removal of statues.,On that -- well, that year,nI had just begun my master's,at the University of Cape Town.,During the timenof the debate of the statue,,I had been having reoccurring dreams,about a bird.,And so I started conjuring her,mentally, spiritually and through dress.,On that day,,I happened to be havingna meeting with my supervisors,,and they told me that the statuenwas going to fall on that day.,I told them that I'd explain later,,but we had to postpone the meeting,because I was going to perform hernas the statue came down. 
 Her name was Chapungu.,She was a soapstone birdnthat was looted from Great Zimbabwe,in the late 1800s,,and is still currently housednin Cecil John Rhodes's estate,in Cape Town.,On that day,,I embodied her existence using my body,,while standing in the blazing sunnfor nearly four hours.,As the time came,,the crane came alive.,The people did, too --,shouting,,screaming,,clenching their fists,and taking pictures of the momentnon their phones and cameras.,Chapungu's wings,,along with the crane,,rose to declare the fallnof Cecil John Rhodes. 
 (Applause) 
 Euphoria filled the airnas he became absent from his base,,while she remained still,,very present,,half an hour after his removal. 
 Twenty-three years after apartheid,,a new generation of radicalsnhas arisen in South Africa.,The story of Chapungu and Rhodesnin the same space and time,asks important questions,related to gender,,power,,self-representation,,history making,and repatriation.,From then on,,I realized that my spiritualnbeliefs and dreams,texture my material reality.,But for me, Chapungu's storynfelt incomplete.,This soapstone bird,,a spiritual medium and messengernof God and the ancestors,,needed me to continue her story.,And so I dabbled in the dream spacena little bit more,,and this is how "Falling" was born.

 In the film,,Zimbabwe, South Africa and Germanynshare a common story,about the soapstone birdsnthat were looted from Great Zimbabwe.,After Zimbabwe gained its independence,,all the birds except for onenwere returned to the monument.,"Falling" explores the mythological beliefnthat there will be unrest,until the final bird is returned. 
 Through my work,,I have realized a lotnabout the world around me:,how we move through spaces,,who we choose to celebrate,and who we remember.,Now I look in the mirrornand not only see an image of myself,,but of the womennwho have made me who I am today.,I stand tall in my work,,celebrating women's histories,,in the hope that perhaps one day,,no little black girl has to ever feel,like she doesn't exist. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Chis Anderson: Christiane,ngreat to have you here.,So you've had this amazing viewpoint,,and perhaps it's fair to saynthat in the last few years,,there have been some alarmingndevelopments that you're seeing.,What's alarmed you most? 
 Christiane Amanpour: Well, just listeningnto the earlier speakers,,I can frame itnin what they've been saying:,climate change, for instance --ncities, the threat to our environment,and our lives.,It basically also boils down tonunderstanding the truth,and to be able to get to the truthnof what we're talking about,in order to really be able to solve it.,So if 99.9 percentnof the science on climate,is empirical, scientific evidence,,but it's competing almost equallynwith a handful of deniers,,that is not the truth;,that is the epitome of fake news.,And so for me, the last few years --ncertainly this last year --,has crystallized the notion of fake newsnin a way that's truly alarming,and not just some slogannto be thrown around.,Because when you can't distinguishnbetween the truth and fake news,,you have a very much morendifficult time trying to solve,some of the great issues that we face. 
 CA: Well, you've been involvednin this question of,,what is balance, what is truth,nwhat is impartiality,,for a long time.,You were on the front linesnreporting the Balkan Wars 25 years ago.,And back then, you famously said,,by calling out human right abuses,,you said, "Look, there are some situationsnone simply cannot be neutral about,,because when you're neutral,,you are an accomplice.",So, do you feel that today's journalistsnaren't heeding that advice,about balance? 
 CA: Well, look, I think for journalists,nobjectivity is the golden rule.,But I think sometimes we don't understandnwhat objectivity means.,And I actually learned this very,nvery young in my career,,which was during the Balkan Wars.,I was young then.,It was about 25 years ago.,And what we faced was the wholesalenviolation, not just of human rights,,but all the way to ethnicncleansing and genocide,,and that has been adjudicatednin the highest war crimes court,in the world.,So, we know what we were seeing.,Trying to tell the worldnwhat we were seeing,brought us accusations of bias,,of siding with one side,,of not seeing the whole side,,and just, you know,ntrying to tell one story.,I particularly and personallynwas accused of siding with,,for instance, the citizens of Sarajevo --,"siding with the Muslims,",because they were the minoritynwho were being attacked,by Christians on the Serb side,in this area.,And it worried me.,It worried me that I was beingnaccused of this.,I thought maybe I was wrong,,maybe I'd forgotten what objectivity was. 
 But then I started to understandnthat what people wanted,was actually not to do anything --,not to step in,,not to change the situation,,not to find a solution.,And so, their fake news at that time,,their lie at that time --,including our government's,nour democratically elected government's,,with values and principlesnof human rights --,their lie was to saynthat all sides are equally guilty,,that this has been centuriesnof ethnic hatred,,whereas we knew that wasn't true,,that one side had decided to kill,nslaughter and ethnically cleanse,another side.,So that is where, for me,,I understood that objectivity meansngiving all sides an equal hearing,and talking to all sides,,but not treating all sides equally,,not creating a forced moral equivalencenor a factual equivalence.,And when you come up againstnthat crisis point,in situations of grave violationsnof international and humanitarian law,,if you don't understandnwhat you're seeing,,if you don't understand the truth,and if you get trappednin the fake news paradigm,,then you are an accomplice.,And I refuse to benan accomplice to genocide. 
 (Applause) 
 CH: So there have always beennthese propaganda battles,,and you were courageous in takingnthe stand you took back then.,Today, there's a whole new way, though,,in which news seems to be becoming fake.,How would you characterize that? 
 CA: Well, look -- I am really alarmed.,And everywhere I look,,you know, we're buffeted by it.,Obviously, when the leadernof the free world,,when the most powerful personnin the entire world,,which is the presidentnof the United States --,this is the most important, most powerfulncountry in the whole world,,economically, militarily, politicallynin every which way --,and it seeks to, obviously, promotenits values and power around the world.,So we journalists,nwho only seek the truth --,I mean, that is our mission --,we go around the worldnlooking for the truth,in order to be everybody's eyes and ears,,people who can't go outnin various parts of the world,to figure out what's going onnabout things that are vitally important,to everybody's health and security.,So when you have a major world leadernaccusing you of fake news,,it has an exponential ripple effect.,And what it does is,nit starts to chip away,at not just our credibility,,but at people's minds --,people who look at us,nand maybe they're thinking,,"Well, if the presidentnof the United States says that,,maybe somewhere there's a truth in there." 
 CH: Presidents have alwaysnbeen critical of the media -- 
 CA: Not in this way. 
 CH: So, to what extent -- 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 CH: I mean, someone a couple years agonlooking at the avalanche of information,pouring through Twitternand Facebook and so forth,,might have said,,"Look, our democracies are healthiernthan they've ever been.,There's more news than ever.,Of course presidentsnwill say what they'll say,,but everyone else can saynwhat they will say.,What's not to like?nHow is there an extra danger?" 
 CA: So, I wish that was true.,I wish that the proliferation of platformsnupon which we get our information,meant that there was a proliferationnof truth and transparency,and depth and accuracy.,But I think the opposite has happened.,You know, I'm a little bit of a Luddite,,I will confess.,Even when we started to talk aboutnthe information superhighway,,which was a long time ago,,before social media, Twitternand all the rest of it,,I was actually really afraid,that that would put peopleninto certain lanes and tunnels,and have them just focusingnon areas of their own interest,instead of seeing the broad picture.,And I'm afraid to saynthat with algorithms, with logarithms,,with whatever the "-ithms" are,that direct us into all these particularnchannels of information,,that seems to be happening right now.,I mean, people have writtennabout this phenomenon.,People have said that yes,nthe internet came,,its promise was to exponentially explodenour access to more democracy,,more information,,less bias,,more varied information.,And, in fact, the opposite has happened.,And so that, for me,nis incredibly dangerous.,And again, when you are the presidentnof this country and you say things,,it also gives leaders in othernundemocratic countries the cover,to affront us even worse,,and to really whack us --nand their own journalists --,with this bludgeon of fake news. 
 CH: To what extentnis what happened, though,,in part, just an unintended consequence,,that the traditionalnmedia that you worked in,had this curation-mediation role,,where certain norms were observed,,certain stories would be rejectednbecause they weren't credible,,but now that the standardnfor publication and for amplification,is just interest, attention,nexcitement, click,,"Did it get clicked on?","Send it out there!",and that's what's --nis that part of what's caused the problem? 
 CA: I think it's a big problem,nand we saw this in the election of 2016,,where the idea of "clickbait"nwas very sexy and very attractive,,and so all these fake news sitesnand fake news items,were not just haphazardlynand by happenstance being put out there,,there's been a whole industrynin the creation of fake news,in parts of Eastern Europe, wherever,,and you know, it's plantednin real space and in cyberspace.,So I think that, also,,the ability of our technologynto proliferate this stuff,at the speed of soundnor light, just about --,we've never faced that before.,And we've never facednsuch a massive amount of information,which is not curated,by those whose professionnleads them to abide by the truth,,to fact-check,and to maintain a code of conductnand a code of professional ethics. 
 CH: Many people here may knownpeople who work at Facebook,or Twitter and Google and so on.,They all seem like great peoplenwith good intention --,let's assume that.,If you could speak with the leadersnof those companies,,what would you say to them? 
 CA: Well, you know what --,I'm sure they arenincredibly well-intentioned,,and they certainly developednan unbelievable, game-changing system,,where everybody's connectednon this thing called Facebook.,And they've created a massiveneconomy for themselves,and an amazing amount of income.,I would just say,,"Guys, you know, it's timento wake up and smell the coffee,and look at what's happeningnto us right now.",Mark Zuckerberg wants to createna global community.,I want to know: What is that globalncommunity going to look like?,I want to know where the codesnof conduct actually are.,Mark Zuckerberg said --,and I don't blame him,nhe probably believed this --,that it was crazy to think,that the Russians or anybody elsencould be tinkering and messing around,with this avenue.,And what have we just learnednin the last few weeks?,That, actually, there has beenna major problem in that regard,,and now they're having to investigate itnand figure it out.,Yes, they're trying to donwhat they can now,to prevent the rise of fake news,,but, you know,,it went pretty unrestrictednfor a long, long time.,So I guess I would say, you know,,you guys are brilliant at technology;,let's figure out another algorithm.,Can we not? 
 CH: An algorithm that includesnjournalistic investigation -- 
 CA: I don't really know how they do it,nbut somehow, you know --,filter out the crap! 
 (Laughter) 
 And not just the unintentional -- 
 (Applause) 
 but the deliberate lies that are planted,by people who've been doing thisnas a matter of warfare,for decades.,The Soviets, the Russians --,they are the masters of warnby other means, of hybrid warfare.,And this is a --,this is what they've decided to do.,It worked in the United States,,it didn't work in France,,it hasn't worked in Germany.,During the elections there,nwhere they've tried to interfere,,the president of Francenright now, Emmanuel Macron,,took a very tough standnand confronted it head on,,as did Angela Merkel. 
 CH: There's some hope to be hadnfrom some of this, isn't there?,That the world learns.,We get fooled once,,maybe we get fooled again,,but maybe not the third time.,Is that true? 
 CA: I mean, let's hope.,But I think in this regard that so muchnof it is also about technology,,that the technology has to also be givennsome kind of moral compass.,I know I'm talking nonsense,nbut you know what I mean. 
 CH: We need a filter-the-crap algorithmnwith a moral compass -- 
 CA: There you go. 
 CH: I think that's good. 
 CA: No -- "moral technology.",We all have moral compasses --nmoral technology. 
 CH: I think that's a great challenge.nCA: You know what I mean. 
 CH: Talk just a minute about leadership.,You've had a chance to speaknwith so many people across the world.,I think for some of us --,I speak for myself,nI don't know if others feel this --,there's kind of been a disappointment of:,Where are the leaders?,So many of us have been disappointed --,Aung San Suu Kyi,nwhat's happened recently,,it's like, "No! Another onenbites the dust.",You know, it's heartbreaking. 
 (Laughter) 
 Who have you met,who you have beennimpressed by, inspired by? 
 CA: Well, you talk aboutnthe world in crisis,,which is absolutely true,,and those of us who spend our whole livesnimmersed in this crisis --,I mean, we're all on the vergenof a nervous breakdown.,So it's pretty stressful right now.,And you're right --,there is this perceived and actualnvacuum of leadership,,and it's not me saying it,nI ask all these --,whoever I'm talking to,nI ask about leadership.,I was speaking to the outgoingnpresident of Liberia today,,[Ellen Johnson Sirleaf,],who -- 
 (Applause) 
 in three weeks' time,,will be one of the very rarenheads of an African country,who actually abides by the constitution,and gives up powernafter her prescribed term.,She has said she wantsnto do that as a lesson.,But when I asked her about leadership,,and I gave a quick-fire roundnof certain names,,I presented her with the namenof the new French president,,Emmanuel Macron.,And she said --,I said, "So what do you thinknwhen I say his name?",And she said,,"Shaping up potentially to be,a leader to fill our currentnleadership vacuum.",I thought that was really interesting.,Yesterday, I happened to havenan interview with him.,I'm very proud to say,,I got his first international interview.nIt was great. It was yesterday.,And I was really impressed.,I don't know whether I should bensaying that in an open forum,,but I was really impressed. 
 (Laughter) 
 And it could be just becausenit was his first interview,,but -- I asked questions,nand you know what?,He answered them! 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 There was no spin,,there was no wiggle and waggle,,there was no spend-five-minutes-nto-come-back-to-the-point.,I didn't have to keep interrupting,,which I've become rathernrenowned for doing,,because I want peoplento answer the question.,And he answered me,,and it was pretty interesting.,And he said -- 
 CH: Tell me what he said. 
 CA: No, no, you go ahead. 
 CH: You're the interrupter,nI'm the listener. 
 CA: No, no, go ahead. 
 CH: What'd he say? 
 CA: OK. You've talked aboutnnationalism and tribalism here today.,I asked him, "How did you have the gutsnto confront the prevailing winds,of anti-globalization,nnationalism, populism,when you can see what happened in Brexit,,when you could see what happenednin the United States,and what might have happenednin many European elections,at the beginning of 2017?",And he said,,"For me, nationalism means war.,We have seen it before,,we have lived through it beforenon my continent,,and I am very clear about that.",So he was not going to,njust for political expediency,,embrace the, kind of, lowestncommon denominator,that had been embracednin other political elections.,And he stood against Marine Le Pen,nwho is a very dangerous woman. 
 CH: Last question for you, Christiane.,Tell us about ideas worth spreading.,If you could plant one ideaninto the minds of everyone here,,what would that be? 
 CA: I would say really be carefulnwhere you get your information from;,really take responsibilitynfor what you read, listen to and watch;,make sure that you go to the trustednbrands to get your main information,,no matter whether you havena wide, eclectic intake,,really stick with the brandnnames that you know,,because in this world right now,nat this moment right now,,our crises, our challenges,nour problems are so severe,,that unless we are all engagednas global citizens,who appreciate the truth,,who understand science,nempirical evidence and facts,,then we are just simplyngoing to be wandering along,to a potential catastrophe. 
 So I would say, the truth,,and then I would come backnto Emmanuel Macron,and talk about love.,I would say that there's notnenough love going around.,And I asked him to tell me about love.,I said, "You know, your marriagenis the subject of global obsession." 
 (Laughter) 
 "Can you tell me about love?,What does it mean to you?",I've never asked a presidentnor an elected leader about love.,I thought I'd try it.,And he said -- you know,nhe actually answered it.,And he said, "I love my wife,nshe is part of me,,we've been together for decades.",But here's where it really counted,,what really stuck with me.,He said,,"It is so important for mento have somebody at home,who tells me the truth." 
 So you see, I brought it home.nIt's all about the truth. 
 (Laughter) 
 CH: So there you go. Truth and love.nIdeas worth spreading. 
 Christiane Amanpour, thank younso much. That was great. 
 (Applause) 
 CA: Thank you.nCH: That was really lovely. 
 (Applause) 
 CA: Thank you."Can you taste words?" 
 It was a questionnthat caught me by surprise.,This summer, I was giving a talknat a literary festival,,and afterwards, as I was signing books,,a teenage girl came with her friend,,and this is what she asked me.,I told her that some peoplenexperience an overlap in their senses,so that they could hear colors,or see sounds,,and many writers were fascinatednby this subject, myself included.,But she cut me off, a bit impatiently,nand said, "Yeah, I know all of that.,It's called synesthesia.nWe learned it at school.,But my mom is reading your book,,and she says there's lotsnof food and ingredients,and a long dinner scene in it.,She gets hungry at every page.,So I was thinking,,how come you don'tnget hungry when you write?,And I thought maybe,nmaybe you could taste words.,Does it make sense?" 
 And, actually, it did make sense,,because ever since my childhood,,each letter in the alphabetnhas a different color,,and colors bring me flavors.,So for instance, the color purplenis quite pungent, almost perfumed,,and any words that I associate with purple,taste the same way,,such as "sunset" -- a very spicy word.,But I was worried that if I tellnall of this to the teenager,,it might sound either too abstract,or perhaps too weird,,and there wasn't enough time anyhow,,because people were waiting in the queue,,so it suddenly felt likenwhat I was trying to convey,was more complicated and detailed,than what the circumstancesnallowed me to say.,And I did what I usually donin similar situations:,I stammered, I shut down,nand I stopped talking.,I stopped talking becausenthe truth was complicated,,even though I knew, deep within,,that one should never, evernremain silent for fear of complexity. 
 So I want to start my talk today,with the answer that I was not ablento give on that day.,Yes, I can taste words --,sometimes, that is, not always,,and happy words havena different flavor than sad words.,I like to explore: What doesnthe word "creativity" taste like,,or "equality,","love," "revolution?" 
 And what about "motherland?",These days, it's particularlynthis last word that troubles me.,It leaves a sweet taste on my tongue,,like cinnamon, a bit of rose water,and golden apples.,But underneath, there's a sharp tang,,like nettles and dandelion.,The taste of my motherland, Turkey,,is a mixture of sweet and bitter. 
 And the reason why I'm telling you this,is because I thinknthere's more and more people,all around the world today,who have similarly mixed emotions,about the lands they come from.,We love our native countries, yeah?,How can we not?,We feel attached to the people,nthe culture, the land, the food.,And yet at the same time,,we feel increasingly frustratednby its politics and politicians,,sometimes to the pointnof despair or hurt or anger. 
 I want to talk about emotions,and the need to boostnour emotional intelligence.,I think it's a pity,that mainstream political theorynpays very little attention to emotions.,Oftentimes, analysts and expertsnare so busy with data and metrics,that they seem to forgetnthose things in life,that are difficult to measure,and perhaps impossible to clusternunder statistical models.,But I think this is a mistake,nfor two main reasons.,Firstly, because we are emotional beings.,As human beings,nI think we all are like that.,But secondly, and this is new,,we have enteredna new stage in world history,in which collective sentimentsnguide and misguide politics,more than ever before.,And through social medianand social networking,,these sentiments are further amplified,,polarized, and they travelnaround the world quite fast.,Ours is the age of anxiety, anger,,distrust, resentment,and, I think, lots of fear.,But here's the thing:,even though there's plenty of researchnabout economic factors,,there's relatively few studiesnabout emotional factors. 
 Why is it that we underestimatenfeelings and perceptions?,I think it's going to be onenof our biggest intellectual challenges,,because our political systemsnare replete with emotions.,In country after country,,we have seen illiberal politiciansnexploiting these emotions.,And yet within the academianand among the intelligentsia,,we are yet to take emotions seriously.,I think we should.,And just like we should focusnon economic inequality worldwide,,we need to pay more attentionnto emotional and cognitive gaps worldwide,and how to bridge these gaps,,because they do matter. 
 Years ago, when I was stillnliving in Istanbul,,an American scholar working onnwomen writers in the Middle East,came to see me.,And at some pointnin our exchange, she said,,"I understand why you're a feminist,,because, you know, you live in Turkey.",And I said to her,,"I don't understandnwhy you're not a feminist,,because, you know, you live in America." 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause),And she laughed.,She took it as a joke,,and the moment passed. 
 (Laughter) 
 But the way she had divided the worldninto two imaginary camps,,into two opposite camps --,it bothered me and it stayed with me.,According to this imaginary map,,some parts of the worldnwere liquid countries.,They were like choppy watersnnot yet settled.,Some other parts of the world,nnamely the West,,were solid, safe and stable.,So it was the liquid landsnthat needed feminism,and activism and human rights,,and those of us who werenunfortunate enough,to come from such places,had to keep strugglingnfor these most essential values.,But there was hope.,Since history moved forward,,even the most unsteady landsnwould someday catch up.,And meanwhile, the citizens of solid lands,could take comfortnin the progress of history,and in the triumph of the liberal order.,They could support the strugglesnof other people elsewhere,,but they themselvesndid not have to struggle,for the basics of democracy anymore,,because they were beyond that stage. 
 I think in the year 2016,,this hierarchical geographynwas shattered to pieces.,Our world no longer followsnthis dualistic pattern,in the scholar's mind, if it ever did.,Now we know that historyndoes not necessarily move forward.,Sometimes it draws circles,,even slides backwards,,and that generationsncan make the same mistakes,that their great-grandfathers had made.,And now we know that there's no such thing,as solid countriesnversus liquid countries.,In fact, we are all livingnin liquid times,,just like the late Zygmunt Bauman told us.,And Bauman had anotherndefinition for our age.,He used to say we are all goingnto be walking on moving sands. 
 And if that's the case, I think,,it should concern us women more than men,,because when societiesnslide backwards into authoritarianism,,nationalism or religious fanaticism,,women have much more to lose.,That is why this needsnto be a vital moment,,not only for global activism,,but in my opinion,nfor global sisterhood as well. 
 (Applause) 
 But I want to make a little confessionnbefore I go any further.,Until recently, whenever I took part innan international conference or festival,,I would be usually onenof the more depressed speakers. 
 (Laughter) 
 Having seen how our dreams of democracynand how our dreams of coexistence,were crushed in Turkey,,both gradually but alsonwith a bewildering speed,,over the years I've feltnquite demoralized.,And at these festivals there would bensome other gloomy writers,,and they would come from placesnsuch as Egypt, Nigeria, Pakistan,,Bangladesh, Philippines,nChina, Venezuela, Russia.,And we would smilenat each other in sympathy,,this camaraderie of the doomed. 
 (Laughter) 
 And you could call us WADWIC:,Worried and DepressednWriters International Club. 
 (Laughter) 
 But then things began to change,,and suddenly our club became more popular,,and we started to have new members.,I remember -- 
 (Laughter) 
 I remember Greek writers and poetsnjoined first, came on board.,And then writers from Hungary and Poland,,and then, interestingly, writersnfrom Austria, the Netherlands, France,,and then writers from the UK,nwhere I live and where I call my home,,and then writers from the USA.,Suddenly, there were more of us,feeling worried aboutnthe fate of our nations,and the future of the world.,And maybe there were more of us now,feeling like strangersnin our own motherlands. 
 And then this bizarre thing happened.,Those of us who used to benvery depressed for a long time,,we started to feel less depressed,,whereas the newcomers,nthey were so not used to feeling this way,that they were now even more depressed. 
 (Laughter) 
 So you could see writersnfrom Bangladesh or Turkey or Egypt,trying to console their colleagues,from Brexit Britainnor from post-election USA. 
 (Laughter) 
 But joking aside,,I think our world is fullnof unprecedented challenges,,and this comes with an emotional backlash,,because in the face of high-speed change,,many people wish to slow down,,and when there's too much unfamiliarity,,people long for the familiar.,And when things get too confusing,,many people crave simplicity.,This is a very dangerous crossroads,,because it's exactly where the demagoguenenters into the picture. 
 The demagogue understandsnhow collective sentiments work,and how he -- it's usually a he --ncan benefit from them.,He tells us that we allnbelong in our tribes,,and he tells us that we will be safernif we are surrounded by sameness.,Demagogues come in all sizesnand in all shapes.,This could be the eccentric leadernof a marginal political party,somewhere in Europe,,or an Islamist extremist imamnpreaching dogma and hatred,,or it could be a white supremacistnNazi-admiring orator somewhere else.,All these figures, at first glance --nthey seem disconnected.,But I think they feed each other,,and they need each other. 
 And all around the world,,when we look at how demagogues talknand how they inspire movements,,I think they have onenunmistakable quality in common:,they strongly, strongly dislike plurality.,They cannot deal with multiplicity.,Adorno used to say,,"Intolerance of ambiguity is the signnof an authoritarian personality.",But I ask myself:,What if that same sign,,that same intolerance of ambiguity --,what if it's the mark of our times,nof the age we're living in?,Because wherever I look,nI see nuances withering away.,On TV shows, we havenone anti-something speaker,situated against a pro-something speaker.,Yeah? It's good ratings.,It's even betternif they shout at each other.,Even in academia, where our intellectnis supposed to be nourished,,you see one atheist scholarncompeting with a firmly theist scholar,,but it's not a real intellectual exchange,,because it's a clashnbetween two certainties. 
 I think binary oppositions are everywhere.,So slowly and systematically,,we are being denied the rightnto be complex.,Istanbul, Berlin, Nice, Paris, Brussels,,Dhaka, Baghdad, Barcelona:,we have seen one horriblenterror attack after another.,And when you express your sorrow,nand when you react against the cruelty,,you get all kinds of reactions,,messages on social media.,But one of them is quite disturbing,,only because it's so widespread.,They say, "Why do you feel sorry for them?,Why do you feel sorry for them?,Why don't you feel sorrynfor civilians in Yemen,or civilians in Syria?" 
 And I think the peoplenwho write such messages,do not understand,that we can feel sorry fornand stand in solidarity with,victims of terrorism and violencenin the Middle East, in Europe,,in Asia, in America, wherever, everywhere,,equally and simultaneously.,They don't seem to understandnthat we don't have to pick one pain,and one place over all others.,But I think this is whatntribalism does to us.,It shrinks our minds, for sure,,but it also shrinks our hearts,,to such an extent that we become numbnto the suffering of other people. 
 And the sad truth is,nwe weren't always like this.,I had a children's book out in Turkey,,and when the book was published,nI did lots of events.,I went to many primary schools,,which gave me a chance to observenyounger kids in Turkey.,And it was always amazing to seenhow much empathy, imagination,and chutzpah they have.,These children are much more inclinednto become global citizens,than nationalists at that age.,And it's wonderful to see,nwhen you ask them,,so many of them wantnto be poets and writers,,and girls are just as confident as boys,,if not even more. 
 But then I would go to high schools,,and everything has changed.,Now nobody wants to be a writer anymore,,now nobody wants to be a novelist anymore,,and girls have become timid,,they are cautious, guarded,,reluctant to speak up in the public space,,because we have taught them --,the family, the school, the society --,we have taught themnto erase their individuality. 
 I think East and West,,we are losing multiplicity,,both within our societiesnand within ourselves.,And coming from Turkey,nI do know that the loss of diversity,is a major, major loss.,Today, my motherland becamenthe world's biggest jailer,for journalists,,surpassing even China's sad record.,And I also believe that what happenednover there in Turkey,can happen anywhere.,It can even happen here.,So just like solid countriesnwas an illusion,,singular identities is also an illusion,,because we all havena multiplicity of voices inside.,The Iranian, the Persian poet, Hafiz,,used to say, "You carry in your soulnevery ingredient necessary,to turn your existence into joy.,All you have to donis to mix those ingredients." 
 And I think mix we can.,I am an Istanbulite,,but I'm also attached to the Balkans,,the Aegean, the Mediterranean,,the Middle East, the Levant.,I am a European by birth, by choice,,the values that I uphold.,I have become a Londoner over the years.,I would like to think of myselfnas a global soul, as a world citizen,,a nomad and an itinerant storyteller.,I have multiple attachments,njust like all of us do.,And multiple attachmentsnmean multiple stories. 
 As writers, we alwaysnchase stories, of course,,but I think we are alsoninterested in silences,,the things we cannot talk about,,political taboos, cultural taboos.,We're also interested in our own silences.,I have always been very vocalnabout and written extensively,about minority rights, women's rights,,LGBT rights.,But as I was thinking about this TED Talk,,I realized one thing:,I have never had the couragento say in a public space,that I was bisexual myself,,because I so feared the slander,and the stigma and the ridicule,and the hatred that was sure to follow.,But of course, one should never,never, remain silent,for fear of complexity. 
 (Applause) 
 And although I amnno stranger to anxieties,,and although I am talking herenabout the power of emotions --,I do know the power of emotions --,I have discovered over time,that emotions are not limitless.,You know? They have a limit.,There comes a moment --,it's like a tipping pointnor a threshold --,when you get tired of feeling afraid,,when you get tired of feeling anxious.,And I think not only individuals,,but perhaps nations, too,nhave their own tipping points.,So even stronger than my emotions,is my awareness,that not only gender, not only identity,,but life itself is fluid.,They want to divide us into tribes,,but we are connected across borders.,They preach certainty,,but we know that life has plenty of magic,and plenty of ambiguity.,And they like to incite dualities,,but we are far more nuanced than that. 
 So what can we do?,I think we need to go back to the basics,,back to the colors of the alphabet.,The Lebanese poetnKhalil Gibran used to say,,"I learned silence from the talkative,and tolerance from the intolerant,and kindness from the unkind.",I think it's a great motto for our times. 
 So from populist demagogues, we will learn,the indispensability of democracy.,And from isolationists, we will learnnthe need for global solidarity.,And from tribalists, we will learnnthe beauty of cosmopolitanism,and the beauty of diversity. 
 As I finish, I want to leave younwith one word, or one taste.,The word "yurt" in Turkishnmeans "motherland.",It means "homeland.",But interestingly, the word also means,"a tent used by nomadic tribes.",And I like that combination,nbecause it makes me think,homelands do not neednto be rooted in one place.,They can be portable.,We can take them with us everywhere.,And I think for writers, for storytellers,,at the end of the day,,there is one main homeland,,and it's called "Storyland.",And the taste of that word,is the taste of freedom. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)Let's go back to 1957.,Representativesnfrom six European countries,had come to Rome,to sign the treaty that wasnto create the European Union.,Europe was destroyed.,A world war had emerged from Europe.,The human suffering was unbelievable,and unprecedented.,Those men,wanted to create a peaceful,,democratic Europe,,a Europe that works for its people. 
 And one of the many building blocks,in that peace project,was a common European market.,Already back then,,they saw how markets,,when left to themselves,,can sort of slip into beingnjust the private property,of big businesses and cartels,,meeting the needs of some businesses,and not the needs of customers. 
 So from our very first day,,in 1957,,the European Union had rules,to defend fair competition.,And that means competition on the merits,,that you competenon the quality of your products,,the prices you can offer,,the services, the innovationnthat you produce.,That's competition on the merits.,You have a fair chancenof making it on such a market.,And it's my job,,as Commissioner for Competition,,to make sure that companiesnwho do business in Europe,live by those rules. 
 But let's take a step back.,Why do we need rulesnon competition at all?,Why not just let businesses compete?,Isn't that also the best for us,if they compete freely,,since more competition,drives more quality,,lower prices, more innovation?,Well, mostly it is.,But the problem isnthat sometimes, for businesses,,competition can be inconvenient,,because competition meansnthat the race is never over,,the game is never won.,No matter how wellnyou were doing in the past,,there's always someone,who are out therenwanting to take your place.,So the temptation to avoid competition,is powerful.,It's rooted in motivesnas old as Adam and Eve:,in greed for yet more money,,in fear of losingnyour position in the market,and all the benefits it brings. 
 And when greed and fear,are linked to power,,you have a dangerous mix.,We see that in political life.,In part of the world,,the mix of greed and fear,means that those who get power,become reluctant to give it back.,One of the many things,I like and admire in our democracies,are the norms,that make our leaders hand over power,when voters tell them to.,And competition rulesncan do a similar thing in the market,,making sure that greed and fearndoesn't overcome fairness.,Because those rules mean,that companies cannot misuse their powernto undermine competition. 
 Think for a moment about your car.,It has thousands of parts,,from the foam that makes the seats,to the electrical wiringnto the light bulbs.,And for many of those parts,,the world's carmakers,,they are dependentnon only a few suppliers.,So it's hardly surprising,that it is kind of temptingnfor those suppliers,to come together and fix prices.,But just imagine what that could do,to the final pricenof your new car in the market.,Except, it's not imaginary.,The European Commission,has dealt with alreadynseven different car parts cartels,,and we're still investigating some.,Here, the Department of Justice,are also lookingninto the market for car parts,,and it has called itnthe biggest criminal investigation,it has ever pursued.,But without competition rules,,there would be no investigation,,and there would be nothingnto stop this collusion from happening,and the prices of your car to go up. 
 Yet it's not only companies,who can undermine fair competition.,Governments can do it, too.,And governments do thatnwhen they hand out subsidies,to just the favorite few, the selected.,They may do thatnwhen they hand out subsidies --,and, of course,nall financed by taxpayers --,to companies.,That may be in the formnof special tax treatments,,like the tax benefits,that firms like Fiat,nStarbucks and Apple got,from some governments in Europe.,Those subsidies stop companiesnfrom competing on equal terms.,They can mean thatnthe companies that succeed,,well, they are the companiesnthat got the most subsidy,,the ones that are the best-connected,,and not, as it should be,,the companies that servenconsumers the best.,So there are times when we need to step in,to make sure that competitionnworks the way it should.,By doing that, we helpnthe market to work fairly,,because competition gives consumersnthe power to demand a fair deal.,It means that companies knownthat if they cannot offer good prices,or the service that's expected,,well, the customersnwill go somewhere else. 
 And that sort of fairnessnis more important,than we may sometimes realize.,Very few people thinknabout politics all the time.,Some even skip it at election time.,But we are all in the market.,Every day, we are in the market.,And we don't want businessesnto agree on prices in the back office.,We don't want themnto divide the market between them.,We don't want one big company,just to shut out competitors,from ever showing us what they can do. 
 If that happens,,well, obviously, we feelnthat someone has cheated us,,that we are being ignorednor taken for granted by the market.,And that may underminennot only our trust in the market,but also our trust in the society.,In a recent survey,,more than two-thirds of Europeans,said that they had feltnthe effects of lack of competition:,that the pricenfor electricity was too high,,that the price for the medicinesnthey needed was too high,,that they had no real choice,if they wanted to travelnby bus or by plane,,or they got poor servicenfrom their internet provider.,In short, they found that the marketndidn't treat them fairly.,And that might seemnlike very small things,,but they can give you this sense,that the world isn't really fair.,And they see the market,nwhich was supposed to serve everyone,,become more like the private propertynof a few powerful companies. 
 The market is not the society.,Our societies are, of course,nmuch, much more than the market.,But lack of trust in the market,can rub off on society,so we lose trust in our society as well.,And it may be the most importantnthing we have, trust.,We can trust each othernif we are treated as equals.,If we are all to have the same chances,,well, we all have to follownthe same fundamental rules.,Of course, some people and some businessesnare more successful than others,,but we do not trust in a society,if the prizes are handed out,even before the contest begins. 
 And this is wherencompetition rules come in,,because when we make surenthat markets work fairly,,then businesses compete on the merits,,and that helps to build the trustnthat we need as citizens,to feel comfortable and in control,,and the trust that allowsnour society to work.,Because without trust,neverything becomes harder.,Just to live our daily lives,nwe need to trust in strangers,,to trust the banks who keep our money,,the builders who build our home,,the electriciannwho comes to fix the wiring,,the doctor who treats us when we're ill,,not to mentionnthe other drivers on the road,,and everyone knows that they are crazy.,And yet, we have to trust them,to do the right thing.,And the thing isnthat the more our societies grow,,the more important trust becomes,and the harder it is to build.,And that is a paradox of modern societies.,And this is especially true,when technology changesnthe way that we interact.,Of course, to some degree,ntechnology can help us,to build trust in one anothernwith ratings systems and other systems,that enable the sharing economy.,But technology also createsncompletely new challenges,when they ask usnnot to trust in other people,but to trust in algorithms and computers. 
 Of course, we all seenand share and appreciate,all the good thatnnew technology can do us.,It's a lot of good.,Autonomous cars can give peoplenwith disabilities new independence.,It can save us all time,,and it can make a much, muchnbetter use of resources.,Algorithms that rely on crunchingnenormous amounts of data,can enable our doctorsnto give us a much better treatment,,and many other things.,But no one is goingnto hand over their medical data,or step into a carnthat's driven by an algorithm,unless they trust the companiesnthat they are dealing with.,And that trust isn't always there.,Today, for example,nless than a quarter of Europeans,trust online businessesnto protect their personal information. 
 But what if people knew,that they could relynon technology companies,to treat them fairly?,What if they knew that those companies,respond to competitionnby trying to do better,,by trying to serve consumers better,,not by using their power,to shut out competitors,,say, by pushing their services,far, far down the list of search results,and promoting themselves?,What if they knewnthat compliance with the rules,was built into the algorithms by design,,that the algorithm had to gonto competition rules school,before they were ever allowed to work,,that those algorithms were designed,in a way that meantnthat they couldn't collude,,that they couldn't formntheir own little cartel,in the black box they're working in? 
 Together with regulation,,competition rules can do that.,They can help us to make sure,that new technology treats people fairly,and that everyone can competenon a level playing field.,And that can help us build the trust,that we need for real innovation,to flourish,and for societies to develop for citizens.,Because trust cannot be imposed.,It has to be earned. 
 Since the very first daysnof the European Union,,60 years ago,,our competition rules have helped,to build that trust.,A lot of things have changed.,It's hard to saynwhat those six representatives,would have made of a smartphone.,But in today's world,,as well as in their world,,competition makes the marketnwork for everyone.,And that is why I am convinced,that real and fair competition,has a vital role to play,in building the trust we need,to get the best of our societies,,and that starts with enforcing our rules,,actually just to makenthe market work for everyone. 
 Thank you.

 Bruno Giussani: Thank you.,Thank you, Commissioner. 
 Margrethe Vestager: It was a pleasure. 
 BG: I want to ask you two questions.,The first one is about data,nbecause I have the impression,that technology and data are changingnthe way competition takes place,and the way competition regulationnis designed and enforced.,Can you maybe comment on that? 
 MV: Well, yes, it isndefinitely challenging us,,because we both have to sharpen our tools,but also to develop new tools.,When we were going throughnthe Google responses,to our statement of objection,,we were going throughn5.2 terabytes of data.,It's quite a lot.,So we had to set up new systems.,We had to figure out how to do this,,because you cannot worknthe way you did just a few years ago.,So we are definitelynsharpening up our working methods.,The other thing isnthat we try to distinguish,between different kinds of data,,because some data is extremely valuable,and they will form, like,na barrier to entry in a market.,Other things you can just --nit loses its value tomorrow.,So we try to make sure,that we never, ever underestimate the fact,that data worksnas a currency in the market,and as an asset that can bena real barrier for competition. 
 BG: Google. You fined themn2.8 billion euros a few months ago. 
 MV: No, that was dollars.nIt's not so strong these days. 
 BG: Ah, well, depends on the -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Google appealed the case.nThe case is going to court.,It will last a while.,Earlier, last year, you asked Applento pay 13 billion in back taxes,,and you have alsoninvestigated other companies,,including European and Russian companies,,not only American companies, by far.,Yet the investigationsnagainst the American companies,are the ones that have attractednthe most attention,and they have also attractednsome accusations.,You have been accused, essentially,nof protectionism, of jealousy,,or using legislationnto hit back at American companies,that have conquered European markets.,"The Economist" just this weeknon the front page writes,,"Vestager Versus The Valley.",How do you react to that? 
 MV: Well, first of all,nI take it very seriously,,because bias has no roomnin law enforcement.,We have to prove our casesnwith the evidence and the facts,and the jurisprudence,in order also to present it to the courts.,The second thing isnthat Europe is open for business,,but not for tax evasion. 
 (Applause) 
 The thing is that we are changing,,and for instance,nwhen I ask my daughters --,they use Google as well --,"Why do you do that?",They say, "Well, because it works.nIt's a very good product.",They would never, ever,ncome up with the answer,,"It's because it's a US product.",It's just because it works.,And that is of course how it should be.,But just the same, it is importantnthat someone is looking after to say,,"Well, we congratulate you,while you grow and grow and grow,,but congratulation stops,if we find that you'renmisusing your position,to harm competitorsnso that they cannot serve consumers." 
 BG: It will bena fascinating case to follow.,Thank you for coming to TED. 
 MV: It was a pleasure. Thanks a lot.
