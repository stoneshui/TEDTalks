I coined my own definitionnof success in 1934,,when I was teaching at a high schoolnin South Bend, Indiana,,being a little bit disappointed,nand [disillusioned] perhaps,,by the way parents of the youngstersnin my English classes,expected their youngstersnto get an A or a B.,They thought a C was all rightnfor the neighbors' children,,because they were all average.,But they weren't satisfiednwhen their own --,it would make the teacher feel that theynhad failed, or the youngster had failed.,And that's not right.,The good Lord in his infinitenwisdom didn't create us all equal,as far as intelligence is concerned,,any more than we're equalnfor size, appearance. 
 Not everybody could earn an A or a B,nand I didn't like that way of judging,,and I did know hownthe alumni of various schools,back in the '30s judgedncoaches and athletic teams.,If you won them all, you were considerednto be reasonably successful --,not completely.,Because I found out --,we had a number of years at UCLAnwhere we didn't lose a game.,But it seemed that we didn't winneach individual game,by the margin that somenof our alumni had predicted --,(Laughter),And quite frequently I really feltnthat they had backed up their predictions,in a more materialistic manner. 
 (Laughter) 
 But that was true backnin the 30s, so I understood that.,But I didn't like it,nI didn't agree with it.,I wanted to come up with somethingnI hoped could make me a better teacher,,and give the youngstersnunder my supervision,,be it in athleticsnor the English classroom,,something to which to aspire,,other than just a highernmark in the classroom,,or more points in some athletic contest. 
 I thought about that for quite a spell,,and I wanted to comenup with my own definition.,I thought that might help.,And I knew how Mr. Webster defined it,,as the accumulationnof material possessions,or the attainment of a position of powernor prestige, or something of that sort,,worthy accomplishments perhaps,,but in my opinion, not necessarilynindicative of success.,So I wanted to come upnwith something of my own. 
 And I recalled --,I was raised on a small farmnin Southern Indiana,,and Dad tried to teach me and my brothers,that you should never try to benbetter than someone else.,I'm sure at the time he didnthat, I didn't -- it didn't --,well, somewhere, I guessnin the hidden recesses of the mind,,it popped out years later.,Never try to be better than someone else,,always learn from others.,Never cease trying to benthe best you can be --,that's under your control.,If you get too engrossednand involved and concerned,in regard to the thingsnover which you have no control,,it will adversely affect the thingsnover which you have control.,Then I ran acrossnthis simple verse that said,,"At God's footstool to confess,,a poor soul knelt, and bowed his head.,'I failed!' he cried.,The Master said, 'Thou didstnthy best, that is success.'" 
 From those things, and one other perhaps,,I coined my own definitionnof success, which is:,Peace of mind attained onlynthrough self-satisfaction,in knowing you made the effort to donthe best of which you're capable.,I believe that's true.,If you make the effort to donthe best of which you're capable,,trying to improve the situationnthat exists for you,,I think that's success,,and I don't think others can judge that;,it's like character and reputation --,your reputationnis what you're perceived to be;,your character is what you really are.,And I think that characternis much more important,than what you are perceived to be.,You'd hope they'd both be good,,but they won't necessarily be the same.,Well, that was my idea that I was goingnto try to get across to the youngsters. 
 I ran across other things.,I love to teach, and it wasnmentioned by the previous speaker,that I enjoy poetry,nand I dabble in it a bit, and love it.,There are some thingsnthat helped me, I think,,be better than I would have been.,I know I'm not what I oughtnto be, what I should be,,but I think I'm betternthan I would have been,if I hadn't run across certain things.,One was just a little verse that said, 
 "No written word, no spoken plea,can teach our youth what they should be;,nor all the books on all the shelves --,it's what the teachers are themselves." 
 That made an impressionnon me in the 1930s.,And I tried to use thatnmore or less in my teaching,,whether it be in sports, or whethernit be in the English classroom.,I love poetry and always hadnan interest in that somehow.,Maybe it's because Dadnused to read to us at night,,by coal oil lamp --,we didn't have electricitynin our farm home.,And Dad would read poetry to us.nSo I always liked it.,And about the same timenI ran across this one verse,,I ran across another one.,Someone asked a lady teachernwhy she taught,,and after some time, she saidnshe wanted to think about that.,Then she came up and said, 
 "They ask me why I teach, and I reply,,'Where could I findnsuch splendid company?',There sits a statesman,nstrong, unbiased, wise;,another Daniel Webster, silver-tongued.,A doctor sits beside him, whose quick,nsteady hand may mend a bone,,or stem the life-blood's flow.,And there a builder; upward risenthe arch of a church he builds,,wherein that ministernmay speak the word of God,,and lead a stumbling soulnto touch the Christ.,And all about, a gathering of teachers,,farmers, merchants, laborers --,those who work and vote and build,and plan and pray into a great tomorrow.,And I may say, I may not see the church,,or hear the word, or eatnthe food their hands may grow,,but yet again I may;,And later I may say,,I knew him once, and he was weak,nor strong, or bold or proud or gay.,I knew him once, but then he was a boy.,They ask me why I teach and I reply,,'Where could I find suchnsplendid company?'" 
 And I believe the teaching profession --,it's true, you have so many youngsters,,and I've got to thinknof my youngsters at UCLA --,30-some attorneys,n11 dentists and doctors,,many, many teachers and other professions.,And that gives youna great deal of pleasure,,to see them go on.,I always tried to make the youngsters feelnthat they're there to get an education,,number one; basketball was second,nbecause it was paying their way,,and they do need a little timenfor social activities,,but you let social activities takena little precedence over the other two,,and you're not goingnto have any very long.,So that was the ideanthat I tried to get across,to the youngsters under my supervision. 
 I had three rules, pretty much,,that I stuck withnpractically all the time.,I'd learned these prior to coming to UCLA,nand I decided they were very important.,One was "Never be late.",Later on I said certain things --,the players, if we were leavingnfor somewhere, had to be neat and clean.,There was a time when I made themnwear jackets and shirts and ties.,Then I saw our chancellor comingnto school in denims and turtlenecks,,and thought, it's not right for me to keepnthis other [rule] so I let them just --,they had to be neat and clean.,I had one of my greatest playersnthat you probably heard of, Bill Walton.,He came to catch the bus; we werenleaving for somewhere to play.,And he wasn't clean and neat,nso I wouldn't let him go.,He couldn't get on the bus,,he had to go home and get cleaned up,to get to the airport.,So I was a stickler for that.nI believed in that.,I believe in time; very important.,I believe you should be on time,nbut I felt at practice, for example --,we start on time, we close on time.,The youngsters didn't have to feelnthat we were going to keep them over. 
 When I speak at coaching clinics,nI often tell young coaches --,and at coaching clinics, more or less,,they'll be the younger coachesngetting in the profession.,Most of them are young, you know,nand probably newly-married.,And I tell them,n"Don't run practices late,,because you'll go home in a bad mood,,and that's not good, for a youngnmarried man to go home in a bad mood.,When you get older, it doesn'tnmake any difference, but --" 
 (Laughter) 
 So I did believe: on time. 
 I believe starting on time,nand I believe closing on time.,And another one I had was,nnot one word of profanity.,One word of profanity,nand you are out of here for the day.,If I see it in a game, you're goingnto come out and sit on the bench.,And the third one was,nnever criticize a teammate.,I didn't want that. I used to tellnthem I was paid to do that.,That's my job. I'm paid to do it.nPitifully poor, but I am paid to do it.,Not like the coaches today,nfor gracious sakes, no.,It's a little differentnthan it was in my day.,Those were three things that I stucknwith pretty closely all the time.,And those actually came from my dad.,That's what he tried to teachnme and my brothers at one time. 
 I came up with a pyramid eventually,,that I don't have the time to go on that.,But that helped me, I think,nbecome a better teacher.,It's something like this:,And I had blocks in the pyramid,,and the cornerstones beingnindustriousness and enthusiasm,,working hard and enjoyingnwhat you're doing,,coming up to the apex,,according to my definition of success.,And right at the top, faith and patience. 
 And I say to you,nin whatever you're doing,,you must be patient.,You have to have patience to --nwe want things to happen.,We talk about our youthnbeing impatient a lot, and they are.,They want to change everything.nThey think all change is progress.,And we get a little older --nwe sort of let things go.,And we forget there isnno progress without change.,So you must have patience,,and I believe that we must have faith.,I believe that we mustnbelieve, truly believe.,Not just give it word service,,believe that thingsnwill work out as they should,,providing we do what we should.,I think our tendency is to hope thingsnwill turn out the way we want them to,much of the time,,but we don't do the thingsnthat are necessary,to make those things become reality.,I worked on this for some 14 years,,and I think it helped menbecome a better teacher.,But it all revolved around thatnoriginal definition of success. 
 You know, a number of years ago,,there was a Major League Baseballnumpire by the name of George Moriarty.,He spelled Moriarty with only one 'i'.,I'd never seen that before, but he did.,Big league baseball players --,they're very perceptivenabout those things,,and they noticed he hadnonly one 'i' in his name.,You'd be surprised how many also told him,that that was one morenthan he had in his head,at various times. 
 (Laughter) 
 But he wrote somethingnwhere I think he did,what I tried to do in this pyramid.,He called it "The RoadnAhead, or the Road Behind.",He said, "Sometimes I think the Fatesnmust grin as we denounce them and insist,the only reason we can't win,nis the Fates themselves have missed.,Yet there lives on the ancient claim:,we win or lose within ourselves.,The shining trophies on our shelvesncan never win tomorrow's game.,You and I know deeper down, there'snalways a chance to win the crown.,But when we fail to give our best,,we simply haven't met the test,nof giving all and saving none,until the game is really won;,of showing what is meant by grit;,of playing through when others quit;,of playing through, not letting up.,It's bearing down that wins the cup.,Of dreaming there's a goal ahead;nof hoping when our dreams are dead;,of praying when our hopes have fled;nyet losing, not afraid to fall,,if, bravely, we have given all.,For who can ask more of a mannthan giving all within his span.,Giving all, it seems to me,nis not so far from victory.,And so the Fates are seldom wrong,nno matter how they twist and wind.,It's you and I who make our fates --,we open up or close the gatesnon the road ahead or the road behind." 
 Reminds me of another set of threesnthat my dad tried to get across to us:,Don't whine. Don't complain.nDon't make excuses.,Just get out there,,and whatever you're doing,ndo it to the best of your ability.,And no one can do more than that.,I tried to get across, too, that --,my opponents will tell you --nyou never heard me mention winning.,Never mention winning.,My idea is that you can losenwhen you outscore somebody in a game,,and you can win when you're outscored.,I've felt that way on certainnoccasions, at various times.,And I just wanted them to be ablento hold their head up after a game.,I used to say that when a game is over,,and you see somebodynthat didn't know the outcome,,I hope they couldn't tell by your actions,whether you outscored an opponentnor the opponent outscored you. 
 That's what really matters:,if you make an effortnto do the best you can regularly,,the results will benabout what they should be.,Not necessarily what you'd want them to benbut they'll be about what they should;,only you will knownwhether you can do that.,And that's what I wantednfrom them more than anything else.,And as time went by,nand I learned more about other things,,I think it worked a little better,,as far as the results.,But I wanted the score of a gamento be the byproduct of these other things,,and not the end itself.,I believe it was one greatnphilosopher who said --,no, no -- Cervantes.,Cervantes said, "The journeynis better than the end.",And I like that.,I think that it is --nit's getting there.,Sometimes when you get there,nthere's almost a let down.,But it's the getting there that's the fun.,As a basketball coach at UCLA,nI liked our practices to be the journey,,and the game would benthe end, the end result.,I liked to go up and sit in the standsnand watch the players play,,and see whether I'd donena decent job during the week.,There again, it's getting the playersnto get that self-satisfaction,,in knowing that they'd made the effortnto do the best of which they are capable. 
 Sometimes I'm asked who wasnthe best player I had, or the best teams.,I can never answer that.,As far as the individuals are concerned --,I was asked one time about that,,and they said,,"Suppose that you, in some way,ncould make the perfect player.,What would you want?",And I said, "Well, I'd wantnone that knew why he was at UCLA:,to get an education,nhe was a good student,,really knew why he was therenin the first place.,But I'd want one that could play, too.,I'd want one to realize that defensenusually wins championships,,and who would work hard on defense.,But I'd want onenwho would play offense, too.,I'd want him to be unselfish,,and look for the pass firstnand not shoot all the time.,And I'd want onenthat could pass and would pass. 
 (Laughter) 
 I've had some that could and wouldn't,,and I've had some that would and could. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, yeah, I'd want that. 
 And I wanted them to be ablento shoot from the outside.,I wanted them to be good inside too. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'd want them to be ablento rebound well at both ends, too.,Why not just take someone likenKeith Wilkes and let it go at that.,He had the qualifications.,Not the only one, but he was onenthat I used in that particular category,,because I think he made the effortnto become the best.,There was a couple. 
 I mention in my book,n"They Call Me Coach,",two players that gavenme great satisfaction,,that came as close as I think anyonenI ever had to reach their full potential:,one was Conrad Burke,nand one was Doug McIntosh.,When I saw them as freshmen,non our freshmen team --,freshmen couldn't playnvarsity when I taught.,I thought, "Oh gracious, if thesentwo players, either one of them" --,they were different years, but I thoughtnabout each one at the time he was there --,"Oh, if he ever makes the varsity,,our varsity must be pretty miserable,nif he's good enough to make it.",And you know, one of them wasna starting player for a season and a half.,The other one, his next year, played 32nminutes in a national championship game,,Did a tremendous job for us.,The next year, he was a starting playernon the national championship team,,and here I thought he'd nevernplay a minute, when he was --,so those are the thingsnthat give you great joy,,and great satisfaction to see. 
 Neither one of those youngstersncould shoot very well.,But they had outstandingnshooting percentages,,because they didn't force it.,And neither one could jump very well,,but they kept good position,nand so they did well rebounding.,They remembered that every shot that'sntaken, they assumed would be missed.,I've had too many stand aroundnand wait to see if it's missed,,then they go and it's too late,nsomebody else is in there ahead of them.,They weren't very quick,nbut they played good position,,kept in good balance.,And so they playednpretty good defense for us.,So they had qualities that --nthey came close to --,as close to reachingnpossibly their full potential,as any players I ever had.,So I consider them to be as successfulnas Lewis Alcindor or Bill Walton,,or many of the others that we had;,there were some outstanding players. 
 Have I rambled enough?,I was told that when he makesnhis appearance, I was supposed to shut up. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause)So I understand that this meeting was planned,,and the slogan was From Was to Still.,And I am illustrating Still.,Which, of course, I am not agreeing with because,,although I am 94, I am not still working.,And anybody who asks me, "Are you still doing this or that?",I don't answer because I'm not doing things still, I'm doing it like I always did.,I still have -- or did I use the word still? I didn't mean that. 
 (Laughter) 
 I have my file which is called To Do. I have my plans.,I have my clients. I am doing my work like I always did.,So this takes care of my age.,I want to show you my work so you know what I am doing and why I am here.,This was about 1925.,All of these things were made during the last 75 years. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 But, of course, I'm working since 25,,doing more or less what you see here. This is Castleton China.,This was an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art.,This is now for sale at the Metropolitan Museum.,This is still at the Metropolitan Museum now for sale.,This is a portrait of my daughter and myself. 
 (Applause) 
 These were just some of the things I've made.,I made hundreds of them for the last 75 years.,I call myself a maker of things.,I don't call myself an industrial designer because I'm other things.,Industrial designers want to make novel things.,Novelty is a concept of commerce, not an aesthetic concept.,The industrial design magazine, I believe, is called "Innovation.",Innovation is not part of the aim of my work.,Well, makers of things: they make things more beautiful, more elegant,,more comfortable than just the craftsmen do.,I have so much to say. I have to think what I am going to say.,Well, to describe our profession otherwise,,we are actually concerned with the playful search for beauty.,That means the playful search for beauty was called the first activity of Man.,Sarah Smith, who was a mathematics professor at MIT, wrote,,"The playful search for beauty was Man's first activity --,that all useful qualities and all material qualities,were developed from the playful search for beauty.",These are tiles. The word, "playful" is a necessary aspect of our work,because, actually, one of our problems is that we have to make,,produce, lovely things throughout all of life, and this for me is now 75 years. 
 So how can you, without drying up,,make things with the same pleasure, as a gift to others, for so long?,The playful is therefore an important part of our quality as designer.,Let me tell you some about my life.,As I said, I started to do these things 75 years ago.,My first exhibition in the United States,was at the Sesquicentennial exhibition in 1926 --,that the Hungarian government sent one of my hand-drawn pieces as part of the exhibit.,My work actually took me through many countries,,and showed me a great part of the world.,This is not that they took me -- the work didn't take me --,I made the things particularly because I wanted to use them to see the world.,I was incredibly curious to see the world, and I made all these things,,which then finally did take me to see many countries and many cultures.,I started as an apprentice to a Hungarian craftsman,,and this taught me what the guild system was in Middle Ages. 
 The guild system: that means when I was an apprentice,,I had to apprentice myself in order to become a pottery master.,In my shop where I studied, or learned, there was a traditional hierarchy,of master, journeyman and learned worker, and apprentice,,and I worked as the apprentice.,The work as an apprentice was very primitive.,That means I had to actually learn every aspect of making pottery by hand.,We mashed the clay with our feet when it came from the hillside.,After that, it had to be kneaded. It had to then go in, kind of, a mangle.,And then finally it was prepared for the throwing.,And there I really worked as an apprentice.,My master took me to set ovens,because this was part of oven-making, oven-setting, in the time.,And finally, I had received a document,that I had accomplished my apprenticeship successfully,,that I had behaved morally, and this document was given to me,by the Guild of Roof-Coverers, Rail-Diggers, Oven-Setters,,Chimney Sweeps and Potters. 
 (Laughter) 
 I also got at the time a workbook which explained my rights,and my working conditions, and I still have that workbook.,First I set up a shop in my own garden,,and made pottery which I sold on the marketplace in Budapest.,And there I was sitting, and my then-boyfriend --,I didn't mean it was a boyfriend like it is meant today --,but my boyfriend and I sat at the market and sold the pots.,My mother thought that this was not very proper,,so she sat with us to add propriety to this activity. 
 (Laughter) 
 However, after a while there was a new factory being built in Budapest,,a pottery factory, a large one.,And I visited it with several ladies, and asked all sorts of questions of the director.,Then the director asked me, why do you ask all these questions?,I said, I also have a pottery.,So he asked me, could he please visit me, and then finally he did,,and explained to me that what I did now in my shop was an anachronism,,that the industrial revolution had broken out,,and that I rather should join the factory.,There he made an art department for me where I worked for several months.,However, everybody in the factory spent his time at the art department.,The director there said there were several women casting,and producing my designs now in molds, and this was sold also to America. 
 I remember that it was quite successful.,However, the director, the chemist, model maker -- everybody --,concerned himself much more with the art department --,that means, with my work -- than making toilets,,so finally they got a letter from the center, from the bank who owned the factory,,saying, make toilet-setting behind the art department, and that was my end.,So this gave me the possibility because now I was a journeyman,,and journeymen also take their satchel and go to see the world.,So as a journeyman, I put an ad into the paper that I had studied,,that I was a down-to-earth potter's journeyman,and I was looking for a job as a journeyman.,And I got several answers, and I accepted the one,which was farthest from home and practically, I thought, halfway to America. 
 And that was in Hamburg.,Then I first took this job in Hamburg, at an art pottery,where everything was done on the wheel,,and so I worked in a shop where there were several potters.,And the first day, I was coming to take my place at the turntable --,there were three or four turntables -- and one of them, behind where I was sitting,,was a hunchback, a deaf-mute hunchback, who smelled very bad.,So I doused him in cologne every day, which he thought was very nice,,and therefore he brought bread and butter every day,,which I had to eat out of courtesy.,The first day I came to work in this shop,there was on my wheel a surprise for me.,My colleagues had thoughtfully put on the wheel where I was supposed to work,a very nicely modeled natural man's organs.,(Laughter),After I brushed them off with a hand motion, they were very --,I finally was now accepted, and worked there for some six months.,This was my first job.,If I go on like this, you will be here till midnight. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 So I will try speed it up a little 
 (Laughter) 
 Moderator: Eva, we have about five minutes. 
 (Laughter) 
 Eva Zeisel: Are you sure? 
 Moderator: Yes, I am sure. 
 EZ: Well, if you are sure,,I have to tell you that within five minutes I will talk very fast.,And actually, my work took me to many countries,because I used my work to fill my curiosity.,And among other things, other countries I worked, was in the Soviet Union,,where I worked from '32 to '37 -- actually, to '36.,I was finally there, although I had nothing to do -- I was a foreign expert.,I became art director of the china and glass industry,,and eventually under Stalin's purges -- at the beginning of Stalin's purges,,I didn't know that hundreds of thousands of innocent people were arrested.,So I was arrested quite early in Stalin's purges,,and spent 16 months in a Russian prison.,The accusation was that I had successfully prepared an Attentat on Stalin's life.,This was a very dangerous accusation.,And if this is the end of my five minutes, I want to tell you that,I actually did survive, which was a surprise.,But since I survived and I'm here,,and since this is the end of the five minutes, I will -- 
 Moderator: Tell me when your last trip to Russia was.,Weren't you there recently? 
 EZ: Oh, this summer, in fact,,the Lomonosov factory was bought by an American company, invited me.,They found out that I had worked in '33 at this factory,,and they came to my studio in Rockland County,,and brought the 15 of their artists to visit me here.,And they invited myself to come to the Russian factory last summer,,in July, to make some dishes, design some dishes.,And since I don't like to travel alone, they also invited my daughter,,son-in-law and granddaughter,,so we had a lovely trip to see Russia today,,which is not a very pleasant and happy view.,Here I am now, if this is the end? Thank you. 
 (Applause)I'd like to do pretty much what I did the first time,,which is to choose a light-hearted theme.,Last time, I talked about death and dying.,This time, I'm going to talk about mental illness.,But it has to be technological,,so I'll talk about electroshock therapy. (Laughter) 
 You know, ever since man had any notion,that some of his other people, his colleagues,,could be different, could be strange, could be severely depressed,or what we now recognize as schizophrenia,,he was certain that this kind of illness,had to come from evil spirits getting into the body.,So, the way of treating these diseases,in early times was to, in some way or other,,exorcise those evil spirits, and this is still going on, as you know. 
 But it wasn't enough to use the priests.,When medicine became somewhat scientific, in about 450 BC,,with Hippocrates and those boys,,they tried to look for herbs, plants,that would literally shake the bad spirits out.,So, they found certain plants that could cause convulsions.,And the herbals, the botanical books of up to the late Middle Ages,,the Renaissance are filled with prescriptions,for causing convulsions to shake the evil spirits out. 
 Finally, in about the sixteenth century,,a physician whose name was Theophrastus Bombastus Aureolus von Hohenheim,,called Paracelsus, a name probably familiar to some people here --,(Laughter) -- good, old Paracelsus,found that he could predict the degree of convulsion,by using a measured amount of camphor to produce the convulsion.,Can you imagine going to your closet, pulling out a mothball, and,chewing on it if you're feeling depressed?,It's better than Prozac, but I wouldn't recommend it. 
 So what we see in the seventeenth, eighteenth century,is the continued search for medications other than camphor that'll do the trick.,Well, along comes Benjamin Franklin,,and he comes close to convulsing himself,with a bolt of electricity off the end of his kite.,And so people begin thinking in terms of electricity to produce convulsions. 
 And then, we fast-forward to about 1932,,when three Italian psychiatrists, who were largely treating depression,,began to notice among their patients, who were also epileptics,,that if they had an epileptic -- a series of epileptic fits,,a lot of them in a row -- the depression would very frequently lift.,Not only would it lift, but it might never return.,So they got very interested in producing convulsions,,measured types of convulsions. 
 And they thought, "Well, we've got electricity, we'll plug somebody into the wall.,That always makes hair stand up and people shake a lot.",So, they tried it on a few pigs, and none of the pigs were killed.,So, they went to the police and they said,,"We know that at the Rome railroad station,,there are all these lost souls wandering around,,muttering gibberish. Can you bring one of them to us?",Someone who is, as the Italians say, "cagoots.",So they found this "cagoots" guy,,a 39-year-old man who was really hopelessly schizophrenic,,who was known, had been known for months,,to be literally defecating on himself,,talking nothing that made any sense,,and they brought him into the hospital.,So these three psychiatrists, after about two or three weeks of observation,,laid him down on a table,,connected his temples to a very small source of current.,They thought, "Well, we'll try 55 volts, two-tenths of a second.,That's not going to do anything terrible to him.",So they did that. 
 Well, I have the following from a firsthand observer,,who told me this about 35 years ago,,when I was thinking about these things,for some research project of mine.,He said, "This fellow" -- remember, he wasn't even put to sleep --,"after this major grand mal convulsion,,sat right up, looked at these three fellas and said,,'What the fuck are you assholes trying to do?' ",(Laughter),If I could only say that in Italian. 
 Well, they were happy as could be, because he,hadn't said a rational word in the weeks of observation.,So they plugged him in again,,and this time they used 110 volts for half a second.,And to their amazement, after it was over,,he began speaking like he was perfectly well.,He relapsed a little bit, they gave him a series of treatments,,and he was essentially cured.,But of course, having schizophrenia,,within a few months, it returned. 
 But they wrote a paper about this,,and everybody in the Western world began using electricity,to convulse people who were either schizophrenic or severely depressed.,It didn't work very well on the schizophrenics,,but it was pretty clear in the '30s and by the middle of the '40s,that electroconvulsive therapy was very, very effective,in the treatment of depression. 
 And of course, in those days, there were no antidepressant drugs,,and it became very, very popular.,They would anesthetize people,,convulse them, but the real difficulty was,that there was no way to paralyze muscles.,So people would have a real grand mal seizure.,Bones were broken. Especially in old, fragile people,,you couldn't use it.,And then in the 1950s, late 1950s, the so-called muscle relaxants,were developed by pharmacologists,,and it got so that you could induce a complete convulsion,,an electroencephalographic convulsion -- you could see it on the brain waves --,without causing any convulsion in the body except a little bit of twitching of the toes.,So again, it was very, very popular and very, very useful. 
 Well, you know, in the middle '60s,,the first antidepressants came out. Tofranil was the first.,In the late '70s, early '80s, there were others,,and they were very effective.,And patients' rights groups seemed to get very upset,about the kinds of things that they would witness.,And so the whole idea of electroconvulsive, electroshock therapy disappeared,,but has had a renaissance in the last 10 years.,And the reason that it has had a renaissance,is that probably about 10 percent of the people, severe depressives,,do not respond, regardless of what is done for them. 
 Now, why am I telling you this story at this meeting?,I'm telling you this story, because actually ever since,Richard called me and asked me to talk about,-- as he asked all of his speakers --,to talk about something that would be new to this audience,,that we had never talked about, never written about,,I've been planning this moment.,This reason really is that I am a man who, almost 30 years ago,,had his life saved by two long courses of electroshock therapy.,And let me tell you this story. 
 I was, in the 1960s, in a marriage. To use the word bad,would be perhaps the understatement of the year.,It was dreadful.,There are, I'm sure, enough divorced people in this room,to know about the hostility, the anger, who knows what.,Being someone who had had a very difficult childhood,,a very difficult adolescence --,it had to do with not quite poverty but close.,It had to do with being brought up in a family where no one spoke English,,no one could read or write English.,It had to do with death and disease and lots of other things.,I was a little prone to depression. 
 So, as things got worse, as we really began to hate each other,,I became progressively depressed over a period of a couple of years,,trying to save this marriage,,which was inevitably not to be saved.,Finally, I would schedule -- all my major surgical cases,,I was scheduling them for 12, one o'clock in the afternoon,,because I couldn't get out of bed before about 11 o'clock.,And anybody who's been depressed here knows what that's like.,I couldn't even pull the covers off myself. 
 Well, you're in a university medical center,,where everybody knows everybody, and it's perfectly clear to my colleagues,,so my referrals began to decrease.,As my referrals began to decrease,,I clearly became increasingly depressed,until I thought, my God, I can't work anymore.,And, in fact, it didn't make any difference,because I didn't have any patients anymore. 
 So, with the advice of my physician,,I had myself admitted to the acute care psychiatric unit of our university hospital.,And my colleagues, who had known me since medical school,in that place, said, "Don't worry, chap. Six weeks,,you're back in the operating room. Everything's going to be great.",Well, you know what bovine stercus is?,That proved to be a lot of bovine stercus.,I know some people who got tenure in that place with lies like that.,(Laughter),So I was one of their failures. 
 But it wasn't that simple. Because by the time,I got out of that unit, I was not functional at all.,I could hardly see five feet in front of myself.,I shuffled when I walked. I was bowed over.,I rarely bathed. I sometimes didn't shave. It was dreadful.,And it was clear -- not to me,,because nothing was clear to me at that time anymore --,that I would need long-term hospitalization,in that awful place called a mental hospital.,So I was admitted, in 1973, in the spring of 1973,,to the Institute of Living, which used to be called the Hartford Retreat.,It was founded in the eighteenth century,,the largest psychiatric hospital in the state of,Connecticut, other than the huge public hospitals,that existed at that time. 
 And they tried everything they had.,They tried the usual psychotherapy.,They tried every medication available in those days.,And they did have Tofranil and other things -- Mellaril, who knows what.,Nothing happened except that I got jaundiced from one of these things.,And finally, because I was well known in Connecticut,,they decided they better have a meeting of the senior staff.,All the senior staff got together, and I later found out what happened. 
 They put all their heads together and they decided,that there was nothing that could be done,for this surgeon who had essentially separated himself from the world,,who by that time had become so overwhelmed,,not just with depression and feelings,of worthlessness and inadequacy,,but with obsessional thinking,,obsessional thinking about coincidences.,And there were particular numbers that every time I saw them,,just got me dreadfully upset -- all kinds of ritualistic observances,,just awful, awful stuff.,Remember when you were a kid, and you had to step on every line?,Well, I was a grown man who had all of these rituals,,and it got so there was a throbbing, there was a ferocious fear in my head.,You've seen this painting by Edvard Munch,,The Scream. Every moment was a scream.,It was impossible. So they decided there was no therapy,,there was no treatment. But there was one treatment,,which actually had been pioneered at the Hartford hospital in the early 1940s,,and you can imagine what it was. It was pre-frontal lobotomy.,So they decided -- I didn't know this, again,,I found this out later --,that the only thing that could be done was,for this 43-year-old man to have a pre-frontal,lobotomy. 
 Well, as in all hospitals, there was a resident,assigned to my case. He was 27 years old,,and he would meet with me two or three times a week.,And of course, I had been there, what, three or four months at the time.,And he asked to meet with the senior staff, and they agreed to meet with him,because he was very well thought of in that place.,They thought he had a really extraordinary future. 
 And he dug in his heels and said,,"No. I know this man better than any of you. I have met with him over and over again.,You've just seen him from time to time. You've read reports and so forth.,I really honestly believe that the basic problem here is pure depression,,and all of the obsessional thinking comes out of it.,And you know, of course, what'll happen if you do a pre-frontal lobotomy.,Any of the results along the spectrum,,from pretty bad to terrible, terrible, terrible,is going to happen. If he does the best he can,,he will have no further obsessions,,probably no depression, but his affect will be dulled,,he will never go back to surgery,,he will never be the loving father that he was to his two children,,his life will be changed. If he has the usual result,,he will end up like 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.',And you know about that, just essentially in a stupor the rest of his life." 
 Well, he said, "Can't we try a course of electroshock therapy?",And you know why they agreed? They agreed to humor him.,They just thought, "Well, we'll give a course of 10.,And so we'll lose a little time. Big deal. It doesn't make any difference.",So they gave the course of 10,,and the first -- the usual course, incidentally, was six to eight,and still is six to eight.,Plugged me into the wires, put me to sleep, gave me the muscle relaxant.,Six didn't work. Seven didn't work.,Eight didn't work. At nine, I noticed --,and it's wonderful that I could notice anything,-- I noticed a change. And at 10, I noticed a real change. 
 And he went back to them, and they agreed to do another 10.,Again, not a single one of them,-- I think there are about seven or eight of them --,thought this would do any good. They thought this was a temporary change.,But, lo and behold, by 16, by 17,,there were demonstrable differences in the way I felt.,By 18 and 19, I was sleeping through the night.,And by 20, I had the sense, I really had the sense,that I could overcome this,,that I was now strong enough that by an act of will,,I could blow the obsessional thinking away.,I could blow the depression away. 
 And I've never forgotten -- I never will forget,-- standing in the kitchen of the unit,,it was a Sunday morning in January of 1974,,standing in the kitchen by myself and thinking, "I've got the strength now to do this.",It was as though those tightly coiled wires in my head had been disconnected,and I could think clearly.,But I need a formula. I need some thing to say to myself,when I begin thinking obsessionally, obsessively.,Well, the Gilbert and Sullivan fans in this room,will remember "Ruddigore," and they will remember Mad Margaret,,and they will remember that she was married,to a fellow named Sir Despard Murgatroyd.,And she used to go nuts, every five minutes or so in the play,,and he said to her, "We must have a word to bring you back to reality,,and the word, my dear, will be 'Basingstoke.'",So every time she got a little nuts,,he would say, "Basingstoke!" And she would say,,"Basingstoke, it is." And she would be fine for a little while. 
 Well, you know, I'm from the Bronx. I can't say "Basingstoke.",But I had something better. And it was very simple.,It was, "Ah, fuck it!",(Laughter) Much better than "Basingstoke,",at least for me. And it worked -- my God, it worked.,Every time I would begin thinking obsessionally --,again, once more, after 20 shock treatments,-- I would say, "Ah, fuck it.",And things got better and better,,and within three or four months,,I was discharged from that hospital, and I joined a group of surgeons,where I could work with other people in the community,,not in New Haven, but fairly close by.,I stayed there for three years.,At the end of three years, I went back to New Haven,,had remarried by that time.,I brought my wife with me, actually, to make sure I could get through this.,My children came back to live with us.,We had two more children after that.,Resuscitated the career, even better than it had been before.,Went right back into the university,and began to write books.,Well, you know, it's been a wonderful life.,It's been, as I said, close to 30 years.,I stopped doing surgery about six years ago,and became a full-time writer, as many people know.,But it's been very exciting. It's been very happy. 
 Every once in a while, I have to say, "Ah, fuck it.",Every once in a while, I get somewhat depressed and a little obsessional.,So, I'm not free of all of this. But it's worked. It's always worked.,Why have I chosen, after never, ever talking about this, to talk about it now?,Well, those of you who know some of these books,know that one is about death and dying,,one is about the human body and the human spirit,,one is about the way mystical thoughts are constantly in our minds,,and they have always to do with my own personal experiences.,One might think reading these books,-- and I've gotten thousands of letters about them,by people who do think this --,that based on my life's history as I've portrayed in the books,,my early life's history, I am someone who has overcome adversity.,That I am someone who has drunk, drank, drunk,of the bitter dregs of near-disaster in childhood,and emerged not just unscathed but strengthened.,I really have it figured out, so that I can advise people about,death and dying, so that I can talk about mysticism and the human spirit. 
 And I've always felt guilty about that.,I've always felt that somehow I was an impostor,because my readers don't know what I have just told you.,It's known by some people in New Haven, obviously,,but it is not generally known.,So one of the reasons that I have come here to talk about this today,is to -- frankly, selfishly --,unburden myself and let it be known,that this is not an untroubled mind that has written all of these books.,But more importantly, I think,,is the fact that a very significant proportion,of people in this audience are under 30,,and there are many, of course, who are well over 30.,For people under 30, and it looks to me like almost all of you,-- I would say all of you --,are either on the cusp of a magnificent and exciting career,or right into a magnificent and exciting career:,anything can happen to you. Things change.,Accidents happen. Something from childhood comes back to haunt you.,You can be thrown off the track.,I hope it happens to none of you,,but it will probably happen to a small percentage of you. 
 To those to whom it doesn't happen, there will be adversities.,If I, with the bleakness of spirit,,with no spirit, that I had in the 1970s,and no possibility of recovery,,as far as that group of very experienced psychiatrists thought,,if I can find my way back from this,,believe me, anybody can find their way back,from any adversity that exists in their lives. 
 And for those who are older, who have lived through,perhaps not something as bad as this,,but who have lived through difficult times,,perhaps where they lost everything, as I did,,and started out all over again, some of these things will seem very familiar.,There is recovery.,There is redemption. And there is resurrection.,There are resurrection themes in every society that has ever been studied,,and it is because not just only do we fantasize,about the possibility of resurrection and recovery,,but it actually happens. And it happens a lot. 
 Perhaps the most popular resurrection theme,,outside of specifically religious ones,,is the one about the phoenix, the ancient story of the phoenix,,who, every 500 years, resurrects itself from its own ashes,to go on to live a life that is,even more beautiful than it was before. Richard,,thanks very much.I thought I would read poems I have that relate to the subject,of youth and age.,I was sort of astonished to find out how many I have actually. 
 The first one is dedicated to,Spencer, and his grandmother, who was shocked by his work.,My poem is called "Dirt." 
 My grandmother is washing my mouth out with soap; 
 half a long century gone 
 and still she comes at me 
 with that thick cruel yellow bar. 
 All because of a word I said, 
 not even said really, only repeated. 
 But "Open," she says, "open up!" 
 her hand clawing at my head. 
 I know now her life was hard; 
 she lost three children as babies, 
 then her husband died too, 
 leaving young sons, and no money. 
 She'd stand me in the sink to pee 
 because there was never room in the toilet. 
 But oh, her soap! 
 Might its bitter burning have been,what made me a poet? 
 The street she lived on was unpaved, 
 her flat, two cramped rooms and a fetid kitchen 
 where she stalked and caught me. 
 Dare I admit that after she did it 
 I never really loved her again? 
 She lived to a hundred, 
 even then. All along it was the sadness, the squalor, 
 but I never, until now 
 loved her again. 
 When that was published in a magazine,I got an irate letter from my uncle.,"You have maligned a great woman.",It took some diplomacy. 
 This is called "The Dress.",It's a longer poem. 
 In those days, 
 those days which exist for me only,as the most elusive memory now, 
 when often the first sound you'd hear in the morning,would be a storm of birdsong, 
 then the soft clop of the hooves,of the horse hauling a milk wagon down your block, 
 and the last sound at night as likely as not 
 would be your father pulling up in his car, 
 having worked late again, always late, 
 and going heavily down to the cellar, to the furnace, 
 to shake out the ashes and damp the draft,before he came upstairs to fall into bed -- 
 in those long-ago days, 
 women, my mother, my friends' mothers,,our neighbors, all the women I knew -- 
 wore, often much of the day,,what were called housedresses, 
 cheap, printed, pulpy,,seemingly purposefully shapeless,light cotton shifts that you wore over your nightgown 
 and, when you had to go look for a child,,hang wash on the line,,or run down to the grocery store on the corner, 
 under a coat,,the twisted hem of the nightgown,always lank and yellowed,,dangling beneath. 
 More than the curlers some of the women,seemed constantly to have in their hair,in preparation for some great event -- 
 a ball, one would think --,that never came to pass; 
 more than the way most women's faces,not only were never made up during the day, 
 but seemed scraped, bleached,,and, with their plucked eyebrows, scarily masklike; 
 more than all that it was those dresses,that made women so unknowable and forbidding, 
 adepts of enigmas to which men could have no access,,and boys no conception. 
 Only later would I see the dresses also,as a proclamation: 
 that in your dim kitchen, your laundry,,your bleak concrete yard, 
 what you revealed of yourself,was a fabulation; 
 your real sensual nature,,veiled in those sexless vestments,,was utterly your dominion. 
 In those days, one hid much else as well: 
 grown men didn't embrace one another,,unless someone had died,,and not always then; you shook hands 
 or, at a ball game, thumped your friend's back,and exchanged blows meant to be codes for affection; 
 once out of childhood you'd never again know,the shock of your father's whiskers on your cheek, 
 not until mores at last had evolved,,and you could hug another man, then hold on for a moment, 
 then even kiss (your fathers bristles,white and stiff now). 
 What release finally, the embrace:,though we were wary -- it seemed so audacious -- 
 how much unspoken joy there was,in that affirmation of equality and communion, 
 no matter how much misunderstanding,and pain had passed between you by then. 
 We knew so little in those days,,as little as now, I suppose,about healing those hurts: 
 even the women, in their best dresses,,with beads and sequins sewn on the bodices, 
 even in lipstick and mascara,,their hair aflow,,could only stand wringing their hands,,begging for peace, 
 while father and son, like thugs,,like thieves, like Romans,,simmered and hissed and hated, 
 inflicting sorrows that endured,,the worst anyway,,through the kiss and embrace, 
 bleeding from brother to brother,,into the generations. 
 In those days there was still countryside,close to the city, farms, cornfields, cows; 
 even not far from our building,with its blurred brick and long shadowy hallway 
 you could find tracts with hills and trees,you could pretend were mountains and forests. 
 Or you could go out by yourself,even to a half-block-long empty lot, 
 into the bushes: like a creature of leaves you'd lurk, 
 crouched, crawling, simplified, savage, alone; 
 already there was wanting to be simpler,,wanting, when they called you, 
 never to go back. 
 (Applause) 
 This is another longish one,,about the old and the young.,It actually happened right at the time we met.,Part of the poem takes place in,space we shared and time we shared. 
 It's called "The Neighbor." 
 Her five horrid, deformed little dogs,who incessantly yap on the roof under my window. 
 Her cats, God knows how many,,who must piss on her rugs --,her landing's a sickening reek. 
 Her shadow once, fumbling the chain on her door,,then the door slamming fearfully shut, 
 only the barking and the music -- jazz --,filtering as it does, day and night into the hall. 
 The time it was Chris Connor singing "Lush Life" -- 
 how it brought back my college sweetheart, 
 my first real love, who -- till I left her --,played the same record. 
 And head on my shoulder, hand on my thigh, 
 sang sweetly along, of regrets and depletions,she was too young for, 
 as I was too young, later, to believe in her pain. 
 It startled, then bored, then repelled me. 
 My starting to fancy she'd ended up in this fire-trap,in the Village, that my neighbor was her. 
 My thinking we'd meet, recognize one another,,become friends, that I'd accomplish a penance. 
 My seeing her, it wasn't her, at the mailbox. 
 Gray-yellow hair, army pants under a nightgown, 
 her turning away, hiding her ravaged face,in her hands, muttering an inappropriate "Hi." 
 Sometimes there are frightening goings-on in the stairwell. 
 A man shouting, "Shut up!" The dogs frantically snarling, 
 claws scrabbling, then her -- her voice,hoarse, harsh, hollow,,almost only a tone, 
 incoherent, a note, a squawk,,bone on metal, metal gone molten, 
 calling them back,,"Come back darlings, come back dear ones.,My sweet angels, come back." 
 Medea she was, next time I saw her. 
 Sorceress, tranced, ecstatic,,stock-still on the sidewalk 
 ragged coat hanging agape,,passersby flowing around her, 
 her mouth torn suddenly open,as though in a scream, 
 silently though, as though only in her brain,or breast had it erupted. 
 A cry so pure, practiced, detached,,it had no need of a voice,,or could no longer bear one. 
 These invisible links that allure,,these transfigurations, even of anguish, that hold us. 
 The girl, my old love,,the last lost time I saw her 
 when she came to find me at a party, 
 her drunkenly stumbling, falling,,sprawling, skirt hiked, eyes veined red,,swollen with tears, her shame,,her dishonor. 
 My ignorant, arrogant coarseness,,my secret pride, my turning away. 
 Still life on a rooftop,,dead trees in barrels, a bench broken,,dogs, excrement, sky. 
 What pathways through pain,,what junctures of vulnerability,,what crossings and counterings? 
 Too many lives in our lives already,,too many chances for sorrow,,too many unaccounted-for pasts. 
 "Behold me," the god of frenzied,,inexhaustible love says,,rising in bloody splendor, "Behold me." 
 Her making her way,down the littered vestibule stairs,,one agonized step at a time. 
 My holding the door. 
 Her crossing the fragmented tiles,,faltering at the step to the street, 
 droning, not looking at me,,"Can you help me?" 
 Taking my arm, leaning lightly against me.,Her wavering step into the world. 
 Her whispering, "Thanks love." Lightly, lightly against me. 
 (Applause) 
 I think I'll lighten up a little.,(Laughter),Another, different kind of poem of youth and age. 
 It's called "Gas." 
 (Laughter) 
 Wouldn't it be nice, I think, 
 when the blue-haired lady in the doctor's waiting room,bends over the magazine table 
 and farts, just a little,,and violently blushes. 
 Wouldn't it be nice if intestinal gas,came embodied in visible clouds, 
 so she could see that her really quite inoffensive pop,had only barely grazed my face 
 before it drifted away. 
 (Laughter) 
 Besides, for this to have happened now,is a nice coincidence. Because not an hour ago,,while we were on our walk, 
 my dog was startled by a backfire,and jumped straight up like a horse bucking. 
 And that brought back to me the stable,I worked on weekends when I was 12, 
 and a splendid piebald stallion, 
 who whenever he was mounted would buck just like that,,though more hugely of course,,enormous, gleaming, resplendent. 
 And the woman, her face abashedly buried,in her "Elle" now, reminded me -- 
 I'd forgotten that not the least part of my awe,consisted of the fact that with every jump he took 
 the horse would powerfully fart. 
 Phwap! Phwap! Phwap! 
 Something never mentioned,in the dozens of books about horses,and their riders I devoured in those days. 
 All that savage grandeur,,the steely glinting hooves,,the eruptions driven from the creature's mighty innards, 
 breath stopped, heart stopped, nostrils madly flared, 
 I didn't know if I wanted to break him, or be him. 
 (Laughter) 
 (Applause) 
 This is called "Thirst.",Many -- most of my poems actually,are urban poems. I happen to be reading a bunch that aren't. 
 "Thirst." 
 Here was my relation with the woman who lived all last autumn and winter, 
 day and night, on a bench,in the 103rd Street subway station,,until finally one day she vanished. 
 We regarded each other, scrutinized one another. 
 Me shyly, obliquely, trying not to be furtive. 
 She boldly, unblinkingly, even pugnaciously,,wrathfully even, when her bottle was empty. 
 I was frightened of her. I felt like a child. 
 I was afraid some repressed part of myself,would go out of control, and I'd be forever entrapped 
 in the shocking seethe of her stench. 
 Not excrement merely, not merely surface,and orifice going unwashed,,rediffusion of rum, 
 there was will in it,,and intention, power and purpose --,a social, ethical rage and rebellion -- 
 despair too, though, grief, loss. 
 Sometimes I'd think I should take her home with me,,bathe her, comfort her, dress her. 
 She wouldn't have wanted me to, I would think.,Instead, I'd step into my train. 
 How rich I would think, is the lexicon,of our self-absolving. 
 How enduring, our bland fatal assurance,that reflection is righteousness being accomplished. 
 The dance of our glances,,the clash, pulling each other through,our perceptual punctures, 
 then holocaust, holocaust,,host on host of ill, injured presences,,squandered, consumed. 
 Her vigil somewhere I know continues. 
 Her occupancy, her absolute, faithful attendance. 
 The dance of our glances, challenge, abdication,,effacement, the perfume of our consternation. 
 (Applause) 
 This is a newer poem, a brand new poem.,The title is "This Happened." 
 A student, a young woman,in a fourth-floor hallway of her lycee, 
 perched on the ledge of an open window,chatting with friends between classes; 
 a teacher passes and chides her,,"Be careful, you might fall,",almost banteringly chides her, 
 "You might fall," 
 and the young woman, 18, a girl really, 
 though she wouldn't think that,,as brilliant as she is, first in her class,,and "Beautiful, too," she's often told, 
 smiles back, and leans into the open window,,which wouldn't even be open if it were winter -- 
 if it were winter someone would have closed it ("Close it!") -- 
 leans into the window, farther, still smiling, 
 farther and farther, though it takes less time,than this, really an instant, and lets herself fall. 
 Herself fall. 
 A casual impulse, a fancy,,never thought of until now, hardly thought of even now ... 
 No, more than impulse or fancy,,the girl knows what she's doing, 
 the girl means something,,the girl means to mean, 
 because it occurs to her in that instant,,that beautiful or not, bright yes or no,,she's not who she is, 
 she's not the person she is, 
 and the reason, she suddenly knows,,is that there's been so much premeditation 
 where she is, so much plotting and planning, 
 there's hardly a person where she is,,or if there is, it's not her, or not wholly her, 
 it's a self inhabited, lived in by her, 
 and seemingly even as she thinks it,she knows what's been missing: 
 grace, 
 not premeditation but grace,,a kind of being in the world spontaneously,,with grace. 
 Weightfully upon me was the world. 
 Weightfully this self which graced the world,yet never wholly itself. 
 Weightfully this self which weighed upon me,,the release from which is what I desire,and what I achieve. 
 And the girl remembers, in this infinite instant,already now so many times divided, 
 the sadness she felt once,,hardly knowing she felt it, 
 to merely inhabit herself. 
 Yes, the girl falls, absurd to fall, 
 even the earth with its compulsion,to take unto itself all that falls,must know that falling is absurd, 
 yet the girl falling isn't myself,,or she is myself,,but a self I took of my own volition unto myself.,Forever. With grace. 
 This happened. 
 (Applause) 
 I'll read just one more. I don't usually say that.,I like to just end.,But I'm afraid that Ricky will come out here,and shake his fist at me. 
 This is called "Old Man," appropriately enough. 
 "Special: big tits," 
 Says the advertisement for a soft-core magazine,on our neighborhood newsstand. 
 But forget her breasts. 
 A lush, fresh-lipped blond,,skin glowing gold, sprawls there,,resplendent. 
 60 nearly, yet these hardly tangible,,hardly better than harlots, can still stir me. 
 Maybe a coming of age in the,American sensual darkness, 
 never seeing an unsmudged nipple,,an uncensored vagina, 
 has left me forever infected,with an unquenchable lust of the eye. 
 Always that erotic murmur, 
 I'm hardly myself,if I'm not in a state of incipient desire. 
 God knows though,,there are worse twists your obsessions can take. 
 Last year in Israel, a young ultra-orthodox Rabbi,guiding some teenage girls through the Shrine of the Shoah 
 forbade them to look in one room.,Because there were images in it he said were licentious. 
 The display was a photo. Men and women stripped naked, 
 some trying to cover their genitals,,others too frightened to bother, 
 lined up in snow,waiting to be shot and thrown into a ditch. 
 The girls, to my horror,,averted their gaze. 
 What carnal mistrust had their teacher taught them. 
 Even that though. Another confession: 
 Once in a book on pre-war Poland, 
 a studio portrait, an absolute angel,,an absolute angel with tormented, tormenting eyes. 
 I kept finding myself at her page. 
 That she died in the camps made her --,I didn't dare wonder why -- 
 more present, more precious. 
 Died in the camps, that too people --,or Jews anyway --,kept from their children back then. 
 But it was like sex, you didn't have to be told. 
 Sex and death, how close they can seem. 
 So constantly conscious now of death moving towards me,,sometimes I think I confound them. 
 My wife's loveliness almost consumes me. 
 My passion for her goes beyond reasonable bounds. 
 When we make love, her holding me,everywhere all around me,,I'm there and not there. 
 My mind teems, jumbles of faces, voices, impressions, 
 I live my life over, as though I were drowning. 
 Then I am drowning, in despair,at having to leave her,,this, everything, all,,unbearable, awful. 
 Still, to be able to die,with no special contrition,,not having been slaughtered, or enslaved. 
 And not having to know history's next,mad rage or regression,,it might be a relief. 
 No. Again, no.,I don't mean that for a moment. 
 What I mean is the world holds me so tightly --,the good and the bad -- 
 my own follies and weakness,that even this counterfeit Venus 
 with her sham heat, and her bosom probably plumped,with gel, so moves me 
 my breath catches.,Vamp. Siren. Seductress. 
 How much more she reveals,in her glare of ink than she knows. 
 How she incarnates,our desperate human need for regard, 
 our passion to live in beauty,,to be beauty, to be cherished by glances, 
 if by no more, of something like love, 
 or love. 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)
