In this rather long sort of marathon presentation,,I've tried to break it up into three parts:,the first being a whole lot of examples on how it can be,a little bit more pleasurable to deal with a computer,and really address the qualities of the human interface.,And these will be some simple design qualities,and they will also be some qualities of, if you will,,the intelligence of interaction.,Then the second part will really just be examples of new technologies --,new media falling very much into that mold.,Again, I will go through them as fast as possible.,And then the last one will be some examples,I've been able to collect, which I think,illustrate this at least as best I can, in the world of entertainment.,People have this belief -- and I share most of it --,that we will be using the TV screens or their equivalents,for electronic books of the future. But then you think,,"My God! What a terrible image you get when you look at still pictures on TV.",Well, it doesn't have to be terrible.,And that is a slide taken from a TV set,and it was pre-processed to be very sympathetic to the TV medium,,and it absolutely looks beautiful. 
 Well, what's happened? How did people get into this mess?,Where you are now, all of a sudden,,sitting in front of personal computers,and video text -- teletext systems,,and somewhat horrified by what you see on the screen?,Well, you have to remember that TV was designed,to be looked at eight times the distance of the diagonal.,So you get a 13-inch, 19-inch, whatever, TV,,and then you should multiply that by eight,and that's the distance you should sit away from the TV set.,Now we've put people 18 inches in front of a TV,,and all the artifacts that none of the original designers expected to be seen,,all of a sudden, are staring you in the face:,the shadow mask, the scan lines, all of that.,And they can be treated very easily;,there are actually ways of getting rid of them,,there are actually ways of just making absolutely beautiful pictures.,I'm talking here a little bit about display technologies. 
 Let me talk about how you might input information.,And my favorite example is always fingers.,I'm very interested in touch-sensitive displays.,High-tech, high-touch. Isn't that what some of you said?,It's certainly a very important medium for input,,and a lot of people think that fingers are a very low-resolution,sort of stylus for inputting to a display.,In fact, they're not: it's really a very, very high-resolution input medium --,you have to just do it twice, you have to touch the screen,and then rotate your finger slightly --,and you can move a cursor with great accuracy.,And so when you see on the market these systems,that have just a few light emitting diodes on the side and are very low resolution,,it's nice that they exist because it still is better than nothing.,But it, in some sense, misses the point:,namely, that fingers are a very, very high-resolution input medium.,Now, what are some of the other advantages?,Well, the one advantage is that you don't have to pick them up,,and people don't realize how important that is --,not having to pick up your fingers to use them. (Laughter) 
 When you think for a second of the mouse on Macintosh --,and I will not criticize the mouse too much --,when you're typing -- what you have -- you want to now put something --,first of all, you've got to find the mouse.,You have to probably stop. Maybe not come to a grinding halt,,but you've got to sort of find that mouse. Then you find the mouse,,and you're going to have to wiggle it a little bit,to see where the cursor is on the screen.,And then when you finally see where it is,,then you've got to move it to get the cursor over there,,and then -- "Bang" -- you've got to hit a button or do whatever.,That's four separate steps versus typing and then touching,and typing and just doing it all in one motion --,or one-and-a-half, depending on how you want to count.,Again, what I'm trying to do is just illustrate,the kinds of problems that I think face the designers,of new computer systems and entertainment systems,and educational systems,from the perspective of the quality of that interface. 
 And another advantage, of course, of using fingers is you have 10 of them.,And we have never known how to do this technically,,so this slide is a fake slide.,We never succeeded in using ten fingers,,but there are certain things you can do, obviously,,with more than one-finger input, which is rather fascinating.,What we did stumble across was something ...,Again, which is typical of the computer field,,is when you have a bug that you can't get rid of you turn it into a feature.,And maybe ... (Laughter),maybe a mouse is a new kind of bug.,But the bug in our case was in touch-sensitive displays:,we wanted to be able to draw -- you know, rub your finger,across the screen to input continuous points --,and there was just too much friction,created between your finger and the glass --,if glass was the substrate, which it usually is. 
 So we found that that actually was a feature,in the sense you could build a pressure-sensitive display.,And when you touch it with your finger,,you can actually, then, introduce all the forces on the face of that screen,,and that actually has a certain amount of value.,Let me see if I can load another disc,and show you, quickly, an example.,Now, imagine a screen, which is not only touch-sensitive now,,it's pressure-sensitive.,And it's pressure-sensitive to the forces both in the plane of the screen --,X, Y, and Z at least in one direction;,we couldn't figure out how to come in the other direction.,But let me get rid of the slide,,and let's see if this comes on.,OK. So there is the pressure-sensitive display in operation.,The person's just, if you will, pushing on the screen to make a curve.,But this is the interesting part. 
 I want to stop it for a second,because the movie is very badly made.,And the particular display was built about six years ago,,and when we moved from one room to another room,,a rather large person sat on it and it got destroyed.,So all we have is this record. (Laughter),But imagine that screen having lots of objects on it,and the person has touched an object --,one of N -- like he did there, and then pushed on it.,Now, imagine a program,where some of those objects are physically heavy and some are light:,one is an anvil on a fuzzy rug,and the other one is a ping-pong ball on a sheet of glass.,And when you touch it, you have to really push very hard,to move that anvil across the screen,,and yet you touch the ping-pong ball very lightly,and it just scoots across the screen.,And what you can do -- oops, I didn't mean to do that --,what you can do is actually feed back to the user,the feeling of the physical properties.,So again, they don't have to be weight;,they could be a general trying to move troops,,and he's got to move an aircraft carrier versus a little boat.,In fact, they funded it for that very reason. 
 (Laughter) 
 The whole notion, then, is one that at the interface,there are physical properties in that transducer --,in this case it's pressure and touches --,that allow you to present things to the user that you could never present before.,So it's not simply looking at the quality or, if you will, the luxury of that interface,,but it's actually looking at the idea,of presenting things that previously couldn't be presented before.,I want to move on to another example,,which is one of a different sort, where we're trying to use computer,and video disc technology now to come up with a new kind of book.,Here, the idea is that you're going to take this book,,if you will, and it's going to come alive.,You're going to sort of breathe life into it.,We are so used to doing monologues.,Filmmakers, for example, are the experts in monologue making:,you make a film and it has a well-formed beginning, middle and end,,and in some sense the art of it is that.,And you then say, "There's an opportunity,for making conversational movies." Well, what does that mean?,And it sort of nibbles at the core of the whole profession,and all the assumptions of that medium.,So, book writing is the same thing. 
 What I'll show you very quickly is a new kind of book,where it is mixed now with ... all sorts of things live in there,,but you have to keep a few things in mind.,One is that this book knows about itself.,Each frame of the movie has information about itself.,So it knows, or at least there is computer-readable information,in the medium itself. It's just not a static movie frame.,That's one thing. The other is that you have to realize,that it is a random access medium,,and you can, in fact, branch and expand and elaborate and shrink.,And here -- again, my favorite example -- is the cookbook,,the "Larousse Gastronomique.",And I think I use the example all too often,,but it's a great one because there is a classic ending in that little,encyclopedia-style cookbook that tells you how to do something like penguin,,and you get to the end of the recipe and it says, "Cook until done.",Now, that would be, if you will, the top green track,,which doesn't mean too much. But you might have to elaborate for me,or for somebody who isn't an expert, and say,,"Cook at 380 degrees for 45 minutes.",And then for a real beginner, you would go down even further,and elaborate more -- say, "Open the oven, preheat, wait for the light to go out,,open the door, don't leave it open too long,,put the penguin in and shut the door ..." (Laughter) whatever.,And that's a much more elaborate one than you dribble back. 
 That's one kind of use of random access.,And the other is where you want to explain the same thing in different ways.,If you're in a classroom situation and somebody asks a question,,the last thing you do is repeat what you just said.,You try and think of a different way of saying the same thing,,or if you know the particular student and that student's cognitive style,,then you might say it in a way that you think,would have a good impedance match with that student.,There are all sorts of techniques you will use --,and again, this is a different kind of branching.,So, what I will show you is ... it's a rather boring book,,but I'm afraid sometimes you have to do boring books,because your sponsors aren't necessarily interested in fiction,and entertainment. And this is a book on how to repair a transmission.,Now, I don't even know what vintage the transmission is,,but let me just show you very quickly some of it, and we'll move on. 
 (Video) Narrator: And continue to get descriptions for each of these chapters.,Nicholas Negroponte: Now, this is his table of contents.,Just a picture of the transmission, and as you rub your finger across the transmission,it highlights the various parts. 
 Narrator: When I find a chapter that I want to see,,I just touch the text and the system will format pages for me to read.,The words or phrases that are lit up in red are glossary words,,so I can get a different definition by just touching the word,,and the definition appears, superimposed over the illustration. 
 NN: This is about the oil pan, or the oil filter and all that.,This is relatively important because it sets the page ... 
 Narrator: This is another example of a page with glossary words,highlighted in red.,I can get a definition of these words just by touching them,,and the definition will appear in the illustration corner.,I can get back to the illustration, but in this case it's not a single frame,,but it's actually a movie of someone coming into the frame and doing the repair,that's described in the text.,The two-headed slider is a speed control that allows me to watch the movie,at various speeds, in forward or reverse.,And the movie is displayed as a full frame movie.,I can go back to the beginning ... and play the movie at full speed.,Here's another step-by-step procedure, only in this case -- 
 NN: Okay, this movie is ... Everybody's heard of sound-sync movies --,this is text-sync movies, so as the movie plays, the text gets highlighted.,We highlight the text as we go through the movie.,Repairman: ... Not too far out. Front poles, preferably.,Don't loosen them too far. If you loosen them too far, you'll have a big mess.,NN: I suspect that some of you might not even understand that language. 
 (Laughter) 
 OK. I'm at the third and last part of this,,which I said I would make an attempt to at least give you some examples,that may be more directly related to the world of entertainment.,And of course, good education has got to be good entertainment,,so my first example will be drawn from a very recent experiment,that we've been doing -- in this case, in Senegal --,where we have tried to use personal computers,as a pedagogical medium. But not as teaching machines at all;,the whole notion is to use this as an instrument,where there is a complete reversal of roles --,the child is, if you will, the teacher and the machine is the student --,and the art of computer programming is a vehicle that sort of,approximates thinking about thinking.,But teaching kids programming per se is utterly irrelevant.,And there are just a few slides I want to go through, 
 but there's a story I'd like to tell. And that was when,,before we did this in any developing countries --,we're doing it, in fact, in three developing countries right now:,Pakistan, Colombia and Senegal --,we did it in some pretty rough areas of New York City.,And one child, whose name I've forgotten, was about seven or eight years old,,absolutely considered mentally handicapped --,couldn't read, didn't even make it in the lowest section of the school's classes --,and was pretty much not in school, though physically there.,But did hang around the, quote, "computer room,",where there were quite a few computers,,and learned this particular language called Logo --,and learned it with great ease and found it a lot of fun,,it was very interesting. And one day, by chance,,some visitors from the NIE came by in their double-breasted suits,looking at this setup, and none of the children who were normally there,,except for this one child, were there. 
 He was, and he said, "Let me show you how this works,",and they got an absolutely ingenuous, wonderful description of Logo.,And the child was just zipping right through it, showing them all sorts of things,until they asked him how to do something which he couldn't explain,and so he flipped through the manual, found the explanation,and typed the command and got it to do what they asked.,They were delighted, and by the time it was time to go see the principal,,whom they'd actually come to see -- not the computer room --,they went upstairs and they said,,"This is absolutely remarkable!,That child was very articulate and showed us,and even dealt with the things he couldn't do automatically,with that manual. It was just absolutely fantastic." 
 The principal said, "There's a dreadful mistake,,because that child can't read.,And you obviously have been hoodwinked,or you've talked about somebody else.",And they all got up and they all went downstairs,and the child was still there. And they did something very intelligent:,they asked the child, "Can you read?",And the child said, "No, I can't.",And then they said, "But wait a minute. You,just looked through that manual and you found ... ",and he said, "Oh, but that's not reading.",And so they said, "Well, what's reading then?",He says, "Well, reading is this junk they give me in little books to read.,It's absolutely irrelevant, (Laughter) and I get nothing for it.,But here, with a little bit of effort I get a lot of return." 
 And it really meant something to the child.,The child read beautifully, it turned out,,and was really very competent. So it actually meant something.,And that story has many other anecdotes that are similar,,but wow. The key to the future of computers in education is right there,,and it is: when does it mean something to a child?,There is a myth, and it truly is a myth:,we believe -- and I'm sure a lot of you believe in this room --,that it is harder to read and write than it is to learn how to speak.,And it's not, but we think speech -- "My God, little children pick it up somehow,,and by the age of two they're doing a mediocre job,,and by three and four they're speaking reasonably well.,And yet you've got to go to school to learn how to read,,and you have to sit in a classroom and somebody has to teach you.,Hence, it must be harder." Well, it's not harder.,What the truth is is that speaking has great value to a child;,the child can get a great deal by talking to you. 
 Reading and writing is utterly useless.,There is no reason for a child to read and write except blind faith,,and that it's going to help you. (Laughter),So what happens is you go to school and people say,,"Just believe me, you're going to like it.,You're going to like reading," and just read and read.,On the other hand, you give a kid -- a three-year-old kid -- a computer,and they type a little command and -- Poof! -- something happens.,And all of a sudden ... You may not call that reading and writing,,but a certain bit of typing and reading stuff on the screen,has a huge payoff, and it's a lot of fun.,And in fact, it's a powerful educational instrument.,Well, in Senegal we found that this was the traditional classroom:,120 kids -- three per desk -- one teacher, a little bit of chalk.,This student was one of our first students,,and it's the girl on the left leaning with her chalkboard,,and she came ... within two days --,I want to show you the program she wrote,,and remember her hairstyle. And that is the program she made. 
 That's what meant something to her, is doing the hair pattern,,and actually did it within two days -- an hour each day --,and found it was, to her,,absolutely the most meaningful piece ...,But rooted in that, little did she know how much knowledge,she was acquiring about geometry,and just math and logic and all the rest.,And again, I could talk for three hours about this subject.,I will come to my last example and then quit.,And my last example -- as some of my former colleagues,,whom I see in the room, can imagine what it will be.,Yes, it is. It's our work -- that was a while ago,,and it still is my favorite project -- of teleconferencing.,And the reason it remains a favorite project,is that we were asked to do a teleconferencing system,where you had the following situation:,you had five people at five different sites -- they were known people --,and you had to have these people in teleconference,,such that each one was utterly convinced,that the other four were physically present.,Now, that is sufficiently,zany that we would, obviously, jump to the bait, and we did.,And the fact that we knew the people --,we had to take a page out of the history of Walt Disney --,we actually went so far as to build CRTs,in the shapes of the people's faces.,So if I wanted to call my friend Peter Sprague on the phone,,my secretary would get his head out and bring it and set it on the desk, 
 (Laughter) 
 and that would be the TV used for the occasion.,And it's uncanny: there's no way I can explain to you,the amount of eye contact you get with that physical face,projected on a 3D CRT of that sort.,The next thing that we had to do is to persuade them,that there needed to be spatial correspondence, which is straightforward,,but again, it's something that didn't fall naturally,out of a telecommunications or computing style of thinking;,it was a very, if you will, architectural or spatial concept.,And that was to recognize that when you sit around the table,,the actual location of the people becomes rather important.,And when somebody gets up, in fact, to go answer a phone,or use a bathroom or something, the empty seat becomes,,if you will, that person. And you point frequently to the empty seat,and you say, "He or she wouldn't agree,",and the empty chair is that person and the spatiality is crucial.,So we said, "Well, these will be on round tables,and the order around the table had to be the same,,so that at my site, I would be, if you will, real,and then at each other's site you'd have these plastic heads.,And the plastic heads, sometimes you want to project them.,And there are a number of schemes, which I don't want to dwell on, 
 but this is the one that we finally used,where we projected onto rear screen material,that was molded in the face -- literally in the face of the person.,And I'll show you one more slide, where this is actually made,from something called a solid photograph and is the screen.,Now, we track, on the person's head, the head motions --,so we transmit with a video the head positions --,and so this head moves in about two axes.,So if I, all of a sudden, turn to the person to my left,and start talking to that person, then at the person to my right's site,,he'll see these two plastic heads talking to each other.,And then if that person interrupts, then those two heads may turn.,And it really is reconstructing, quite accurately, teleconferencing.I'm going to go right into the slides.,And all I'm going to try and prove to you with these slides,is that I do just very straight stuff.,And my ideas are --,in my head, anyway -- they're very logical,and relate to what's going on and problem solving for clients.,I either convince clients at the end that I solve their problems,,or I really do solve their problems,,because usually they seem to like it. 
 Let me go right into the slides.,Can you turn off the light? Down.,I like to be in the dark.,I don't want you to see what I'm doing up here. 
 (Laughter) 
 Anyway, I did this house in Santa Monica,,and it got a lot of notoriety.,In fact, it appeared in a porno comic book,,which is the slide on the right. 
 (Laughter) 
 This is in Venice.,I just show it because I want you to know,I'm concerned about context.,On the left-hand side,,I had the context of those little houses,,and I tried to build a building that fit into that context.,When people take pictures of these buildings out of that context,they look really weird,,and my premise is that they make a lot more sense,when they're photographed or seen in that space.,And then, once I deal with the context,,I then try to make a place that's comfortable and private and fairly serene,,as I hope you'll find that slide on the right. 
 And then I did a law school for Loyola in downtown L.A.,I was concerned about making a place for the study of law.,And we continue to work with this client.,The building on the right at the top is now under construction.,The garage on the right -- the gray structure -- will be torn down,,finally, and several small classrooms will be placed,along this avenue that we've created, this campus.,And it all related to the clients and the students,from the very first meeting saying they felt denied a place.,They wanted a sense of place.,And so the whole idea here was to create that kind of space,in downtown, in a neighborhood that was difficult to fit into.,And it was my theory, or my point of view,,that one didn't upstage the neighborhood --,one made accommodations.,I tried to be inclusive, to include the buildings in the neighborhood,,whether they were buildings I liked or not. 
 In the '60s I started working with paper furniture,and made a bunch of stuff that was very successful in Bloomingdale's.,We even made flooring, walls and everything, out of cardboard.,And the success of it threw me for a loop.,I couldn't deal with the success of furniture --,I wasn't secure enough as an architect --,and so I closed it all up and made furniture that nobody would like. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, nobody would like this.,And it was in this, preliminary to these pieces of furniture,,that Ricky and I worked on furniture by the slice.,And after we failed, I just kept failing. 
 (Laughter) 
 The piece on the left --,and that ultimately led to the piece on the right --,happened when the kid that was working on this,took one of those long strings of stuff and folded it up,to put it in the wastebasket.,And I put a piece of tape around it,,as you see there, and realized you could sit on it,,and it had a lot of resilience and strength and so on.,So, it was an accidental discovery. 
 I got into fish. 
 (Laughter) 
 I mean, the story I tell is that I got mad at postmodernism -- at po-mo --,and said that fish were 500 million years earlier than man,,and if you're going to go back, we might as well go back to the beginning.,And so I started making these funny things.,And they started to have a life of their own and got bigger --,as the one glass at the Walker.,And then, I sliced off the head and the tail and everything,and tried to translate what I was learning,about the form of the fish and the movement.,And a lot of my architectural ideas that came from it --,accidental, again --,it was an intuitive kind of thing, and I just kept going with it,,and made this proposal for a building, which was only a proposal. 
 I did this building in Japan.,I was taken out to dinner after the contract,for this little restaurant was signed.,And I love sake and Kobe and all that stuff.,And after I got -- I was really drunk --,I was asked to do some sketches on napkins. 
 (Laughter) 
 And I made some sketches on napkins --,little boxes and Morandi-like things that I used to do.,And the client said, "Why no fish?",And so I made a drawing with a fish, and I left Japan.,Three weeks later, I received a complete set of drawings,saying we'd won the competition. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, it's hard to do. It's hard to translate a fish form,,because they're so beautiful -- perfect --,into a building or object like this.,And Oldenburg, who I work with a little once in a while,,told me I couldn't do it, and so that made it even more exciting.,But he was right -- I couldn't do the tail.,I started to get the head OK, but the tail I couldn't do.,It was pretty hard.,The thing on the right is a snake form, a ziggurat.,And I put them together, and you walk between them.,It was a dialog with the context again.,Now, if you saw a picture of this,as it was published in Architectural Record --,they didn't show the context, so you would think,,"God, what a pushy guy this is.",But a friend of mine spent four hours wandering around here,looking for this restaurant.,Couldn't find it.,So ... 
 (Laughter) 
 As for craft and technology and all those things,that you've all been talking about, I was thrown for a complete loop.,This was built in six months.,The way we sent drawings to Japan:,we used the magic computer in Michigan that does carved models,,and we used to make foam models, which that thing scanned.,We made the drawings of the fish and the scales.,And when I got there, everything was perfect --,except the tail.,So, I decided to cut off the head and the tail. 
 And I made the object on the left for my show at the Walker.,And it's one of the nicest pieces I've ever made, I think.,And then Jay Chiat, a friend and client,,asked me to do his headquarters building in L.A.,For reasons we don't want to talk about, it got delayed.,Toxic waste, I guess, is the key clue to that one.,And so we built a temporary building -- I'm getting good at temporary --,and we put a conference room in that's a fish. 
 And, finally, Jay dragged me to my hometown, Toronto, Canada.,And there is a story -- it's a real story -- about my grandmother,buying a carp on Thursday, bringing it home,,putting it in the bathtub when I was a kid.,I played with it in the evening.,When I went to sleep, the next day it wasn't there.,And the next night, we had gefilte fish. 
 (Laughter) 
 And so I set up this interior for Jay's offices,and I made a pedestal for a sculpture.,And he didn't buy a sculpture, so I made one.,I went around Toronto and found a bathtub like my grandmother's,,and I put the fish in.,It was a joke. 
 (Laughter) 
 I play with funny people like [Claes] Oldenburg.,We've been friends for a long time.,And we've started to work on things.,A few years ago, we did a performance piece in Venice, Italy,,called "Il Corso del Coltello" -- the Swiss Army knife.,And most of the imagery is -- 
 (Laughter) 
 Claes', but those two little boys are my sons,,and they were Claes' assistants in the play.,He was the Swiss Army knife.,He was a souvenir salesman who always wanted to be a painter,,and I was Frankie P. Toronto.,P for Palladio.,Dressed up like the AT&T building by Claes -- 
 (Laughter) 
 with a fish hat.,The highlight of the performance was at the end.,This beautiful object, the Swiss Army knife,,which I get credit for participating in.,And I can tell you -- it's totally an Oldenburg.,I had nothing to do with it.,The only thing I did was, I made it possible for them,to turn those blades so you could sail this thing in the canal,,because I love sailing. 
 (Laughter) 
 We made it into a sailing craft. 
 I've been known to mess with things like chain link fencing.,I do it because it's a curious thing in the culture,,when things are made in such great quantities,,absorbed in such great quantities,,and there's so much denial about them.,People hate it.,And I'm fascinated with that, which, like the paper furniture --,it's one of those materials.,And I'm always drawn to that.,And so I did a lot of dirty things with chain link,,which nobody will forgive me for.,But Claes made homage to it in the Loyola Law School.,And that chain link is really expensive.,It's in perspective and everything. 
 And then we did a camp together for children with cancer.,And you can see, we started making a building together.,Of course, the milk can is his.,But we were trying to collide our ideas,,to put objects next to each other.,Like a Morandi -- like the little bottles -- composing them like a still life.,And it seemed to work as a way to put he and I together. 
 Then Jay Chiat asked me to do this building,on this funny lot in Venice, and I started with this three-piece thing,,and you entered in the middle.,And Jay asked me what I was going to do with the piece in the middle.,And he pushed that.,And one day I had a -- oh, well, the other way.,I had the binoculars from Claes, and I put them there,,and I could never get rid of them after that.,Oldenburg made the binoculars incredible,when he sent me the first model of the real proposal.,It made my building look sick.,And it was this interaction between,that kind of, up-the-ante stuff that became pretty interesting.,It led to the building on the left.,And I still think the Time magazine picture will be of the binoculars, you know,,leaving out the -- what the hell. 
 I use a lot of metal in my work,,and I have a hard time connecting with the craft.,The whole thing about my house,,the whole use of rough carpentry and everything,,was the frustration with the crafts available.,I said, "If I can't get the craft that I want,,I'll use the craft I can get.",There were plenty of models for that,,in Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, and many artists,who were making beautiful art and sculpture with junk materials.,I went into the metal because it was a way of building a building,that was a sculpture.,And it was all of one material,,and the metal could go on the roof as well as the walls.,The metalworkers, for the most part,,do ducts behind the ceilings and stuff.,I was given an opportunity to design an exhibit,for the metalworkers' unions of America and Canada in Washington,,and I did it on the condition that they become my partners,in the future and help me with all future metal buildings, etc. etc.,And it's working very well,to have these people, these craftsmen, interested in it.,I just tell the stories.,It's a way of connecting, at least, with some of those people,that are so important to the realization of architecture. 
 The metal continued into a building -- Herman Miller, in Sacramento.,And it's just a complex of factory buildings.,And Herman Miller has this philosophy of having a place --,a people place.,I mean, it's kind of a trite thing to say,,but it is real that they wanted to have a central place,where the cafeteria would be, where the people would come,and where the people working would interact.,So it's out in the middle of nowhere, and you approach it.,It's copper and galvanize.,I used the galvanize and copper,in a very light gauge, so it would buckle.,I spent a lot of time undoing Richard Meier's aesthetic.,Everybody's trying to get the panels perfect,,and I always try to get them sloppy and fuzzy.,And they end up looking like stone.,This is the central area.,There's a ramp. 
 And that little dome in there is a building by Stanley Tigerman.,Stanley was instrumental in my getting this job.,And when I was awarded the contract I, at the very beginning,,asked the client if they would let Stanley do a cameo piece with me.,Because these were ideas that we were talking about,,building things next to each other, making --,it's all about [a] metaphor for a city, maybe.,And so Stanley did the little dome thing.,And we did it over the phone and by fax.,He would send me a fax and show me something.,He'd made a building with a dome and he had a little tower.,I told him, "No, no, that's too ongepotchket.,I don't want the tower.",So he came back with a simpler building,,but he put some funny details on it,,and he moved it closer to my building.,And so I decided to put him in a depression.,I put him in a hole and made a kind of a hole that he sits in.,And so then he put two bridges -- this all happened on the fax,,going back and forth over a couple of weeks' period.,And he put these two bridges with pink guardrails on it.,And so then I put this big billboard behind it.,And I call it, "David and Goliath.",And that's my cafeteria. 
 In Boston, we had that old building on the left.,It was a very prominent building off the freeway,,and we added a floor and cleaned it up and fixed it up,and used the kind of -- I thought -- the language of the neighborhood,,which had these cornices, projecting cornices.,Mine got a little exuberant, but I used lead copper,,which is a beautiful material, and it turns green in 100 years.,Instead of, like, copper in 10 or 15.,We redid the side of the building,and re-proportioned the windows so it sort of fit into the space.,And it surprised both Boston and myself that we got it approved,,because they have very strict kind of design guideline,,and they wouldn't normally think I would fit them.,The detailing was very careful with the lead copper,and making panels and fitting it tightly,into the fabric of the existing building. 
 In Barcelona, on Las Ramblas for some film festival,,I did the Hollywood sign going and coming,,made a building out of it, and they built it.,I flew in one night and took this picture.,But they made it a third smaller than my model without telling me. 
 And then more metal and some chain link in Santa Monica --,a little shopping center. 
 And this is a laser laboratory at the University of Iowa,,in which the fish comes back as an abstraction in the back.,It's the support labs, which, by some coincidence, required no windows.,And the shape fit perfectly.,I just joined the points.,In the curved part there's all the mechanical equipment.,That solid wall behind it is a pipe chase -- a pipe canyon --,and so it was an opportunity that I seized,,because I didn't have to have any protruding ducts or vents or things in this form.,It gave me an opportunity to make a sculpture out of it. 
 This is a small house somewhere.,They've been building it so long I don't remember where it is.,It's in the West Valley.,And we started with the stream,and built the house along the stream -- dammed it up to make a lake.,These are the models.,The reality, with the lake --,the workmanship is pretty bad.,And it reminded me why I play defensively in things like my house.,When you have to do something really cheaply,,it's hard to get perfect corners and stuff.,That big metal thing is a passage, and in it is --,you go downstairs into the living room and then down into the bedroom,,which is on the right.,It's kind of like a whole built town. 
 I was asked to do a hospital for schizophrenic adolescents at Yale.,I thought it was fitting for me to be doing that. 
 This is a house next to a Philip Johnson house in Minnesota.,The owners had a dilemma -- they asked Philip to do it.,He was too busy.,He didn't recommend me, by the way. 
 (Laughter) 
 We ended up having to make it a sculpture, because the dilemma was,,how do you build a building that doesn't look like the language?,Is it going to look like this beautiful estate is sub-divided?,Etc. etc.,You've got the idea.,And so we finally ended up making it.,These people are art collectors.,And we finally made it so it appears very sculptural,from the main house and all the windows are on the other side.,And the building is very sculptural as you walk around it.,It's made of metal and the brown stuff is Fin-Ply --,it's that formed lumber from Finland.,We used it at Loyola on the chapel, and it didn't work.,I keep trying to make it work.,In this case we learned how to detail it. 
 In Cleveland, there's Burnham Mall, on the left.,It's never been finished.,Going out to the lake, you can see all those new buildings we built.,And we had the opportunity to build a building on this site.,There's a railroad track.,This is the city hall over here somewhere, and the courthouse.,And the centerline of the mall goes out.,Burnham had designed a railroad station that was never built,,and so we followed.,Sohio is on the axis here,,and we followed the axis, and they're two kind of goalposts.,And this is our building,,which is a corporate headquarters for an insurance company.,We collaborated with Oldenburg and put the newspaper on top, folded.,The health club is fastened to the garage,with a C-clamp, for Cleveland. 
 (Laughter) 
 You drive down.,So it's about a 10-story C-clamp.,And all this stuff at the bottom is a museum,,and an idea for a very fancy automobile entry.,This owner has a pet peeve about bad automobile entries.,And this would be a hotel.,So, the centerline of this thing -- we'd preserve it,,and it would start to work with the scale of the new buildings,by Pelli and Kohn Pederson Fox, etc., that are underway.,It's hard to do high-rise.,I feel much more comfortable down here. 
 This is a piece of property in Brentwood.,And a long time ago, about '82 or something, after my house --,I designed a house for myself,that would be a village of several pavilions around a courtyard --,and the owner of this lot worked for me,and built that actual model on the left.,And she came back,,I guess wealthier or something -- something happened --,and asked me to design a house for her on this site.,And following that basic idea of the village,,we changed it as we got into it.,I locked the house into the site by cutting the back end --,here you see on the photographs of the site --,slicing into it and putting all the bathrooms and dressing rooms,like a retaining wall, creating a lower level zone for the master bedroom,,which I designed like a kind of a barge,,looking like a boat.,And that's it, built.,The dome was a request from the client.,She wanted a dome somewhere in the house.,She didn't care where.,When you sleep in this bedroom, I hope --,I mean, I haven't slept in it yet.,I've offered to marry her so I could sleep there,,but she said I didn't have to do that.,But when you're in that room,,you feel like you're on a kind of barge on some kind of lake.,And it's very private.,The landscape is being built around to create a private garden.,And then up above there's a garden on this side of the living room,,and one on the other side. 
 These aren't focused very well.,I don't know how to do it from here.,Focus the one on the right.,It's up there.,Left -- it's my right. 
 Anyway, you enter into a garden with a beautiful grove of trees.,That's the living room.,Servants' quarters.,A guest bedroom, which has this dome with marble on it.,And then you enter into the living room and then so on.,This is the bedroom.,You come down from this level along the stairway,,and you enter the bedroom here, going into the lake.,And the bed is back in this space,,with windows looking out onto the lake.,These Stonehenge things were designed to give foreground,and to create a greater depth in this shallow lot.,The material is lead copper, like in the building in Boston.,And so it was an intent to make this small piece of land --,it's 100 by 250 -- into a kind of an estate by separating these areas,and making the living room and dining room into this pavilion,with a high space in it.,And this happened by accident that I got this right on axis,with the dining room table.,It looks like I got a Baldessari painting for free.,But the idea is, the windows are all placed,so you see pieces of the house outside.,Eventually this will be screened -- these trees will come up --,and it will be very private.,And you feel like you're in your own kind of village. 
 This is for Michael Eisner -- Disney.,We're doing some work for him. 
 And this is in Anaheim, California, and it's a freeway building.,You go under this bridge at about 65 miles an hour,,and there's another bridge here.,And you're through this room in a split second,,and the building will sort of reflect that.,On the backside, it's much more humane -- entrance,,dining hall, etc.,And then this thing here -- I'm hoping as you drive by you'll hear,the picket fence effect of the sound hitting it.,Kind of a fun thing to do. 
 I'm doing a building in Switzerland, Basel,,which is an office building for a furniture company.,And we struggled with the image.,These are the early studies, but they have to sell furniture,to normal people, so if I did the building and it was too fancy,,then people might say, "Well, the furniture looks OK in his thing,,but no, it ain't going to look good in my normal building.",So we've made a kind of pragmatic slab in the second phase here,,and we've taken the conference facilities and made a villa out of them,so that the communal space is very sculptural and separate.,And you're looking at it from the offices and you create a kind of,interaction between these pieces. 
 This is in Paris, along the Seine.,Palais des Sports, the Gare de Lyon over here.,The Minister of Finance -- the guy that moved from the Louvre -- goes in here.,There's a new library across the river.,And back in here, in this already treed park,,we're doing a very dense building called the American Center,,which has a theater, apartments, dance school, an art museum,,restaurants and all kinds of -- it's a very dense program --,bookstores, etc.,In a very tight, small --,this is the ground level.,And the French have this extraordinary way of screwing things up,by taking a beautiful site and cutting the corner off.,They call it the plan coupe.,And I struggled with that thing --,how to get around the corner. 
 These are the models for it.,I showed you the other model, the one --,this is the way I organized myself so I could make the drawing --,so I understood the problem.,I was trying to get around this plan coupe -- how do you do it?,Apartments, etc.,And these are the kind of study models we did.,And the one on the left is pretty awful.,You can see why I was ready to commit suicide when this one was built.,But out of it came finally this resolution, where the elevator piece,worked frontally to this, parallel to this street,,and also parallel to here.,And then this kind of twist, with this balcony and the skirt,,kind of like a ballerina lifting her skirt to let you into the foyer.,The restaurants here -- the apartments and the theater, etc.,So it would all be built in stone, in French limestone,,except for this metal piece.,And it faces into a park.,And the idea was to make this express the energy of this.,On the side facing the street it's much more normal,,except I slipped a few mansards down, so that coming on the point,,these housing units made a gesture to the corner.,And this will be some kind of high-tech billboard.,If any of you guys have any ideas for it, please contact me.,I don't know what to do. 
 Jay Chiat is a glutton for punishment, and he hired me,to do a house for him in the Hamptons.,And it's got a fish.,And I keep thinking, "This is going to be the last fish.",It's like a drug addict.,I say, "I'm not going to do it anymore -- I don't want to do it anymore --,I'm not going to do it.",And then I do it. 
 (Laughter) 
 There it is.,But it's the living room.,And this piece here is --,I don't know what it is.,I just added it so that we'd have enough money in the budget,so we could take something out. 
 (Applause) 
 This is Euro Disney, and I've worked with all of the guys,that presented to you earlier.,We've had a lot of fun working together.,I think I'm from Mars for them, and they are for me,,but somehow we all manage to work together,,and I think, productively.,So far.,This is a shopping thing.,You come into the Magic Kingdom,and the hotel that Tony Baxter's group is doing out here.,And then this is a kind of a shopping mall,,with a rodeo and restaurants.,And another restaurant.,What I did -- because of the Paris skies being quite dull,,I made a light grid that's perpendicular to the train station,,to the route of the train.,It looks like it's kind of been there,,and then crashed all these simpler forms into it.,The light grid will have a light, be lit up at night and give a,kind of light ceiling.,In Switzerland -- Germany, actually -- on the Rhine across from Basel,,we did a furniture factory and a furniture museum. 
 And I tried to -- there's a Nick Grimshaw building over here,,there's an Oldenburg sculpture over here --,I tried to make a relationship urbanistically.,And I don't gave good slides to show -- it's just been completed --,but this piece here is this building, and these pieces here and here.,And as you pass by it's always part -- you see it as all of these pieces,accrue and become part of an overall neighborhood.,It's plaster and just zinc.,And you wonder, if this is a museum,,what it's going to be like inside?,If it's going to be so busy and crazy that you wouldn't show anything,,and just wait.,I'm so cunning and clever -- I made it quiet and wonderful.,But on the outside it does scream out at you a bit.,It's actually basically three square rooms,with a couple of skylights and stuff.,And from the building in the back, you see it as,an iceberg floating by in the hills.,I know I'm over time.,See, that skylight goes down and becomes that one.,So it's pretty quiet inside. 
 This is the Disney Hall -- the concert hall.,It's a complicated project.,It has a chamber hall.,It's related to an existing Chandler Pavilion that was built,with a lot of love and tears and caring.,And it's not a great building, but I approached it optimistically,,that we would make a compositional relationship between us,that would strengthen both of us.,And the plan of this -- it's a concert hall.,This is the foyer, which is kind of a garden structure.,There's commercial at the ground floor.,These are offices, which, really, in the competition,,we didn't have to design.,But finally, there's a hotel there.,These were the kind of relationships made to the Chandler,,composing these elevations together and relating them,to the buildings that existed -- to MOCA, etc. 
 The acoustician in the competition gave us criteria,,which led to this compartmentalized scheme,,which we found out after the competition would not work at all.,But everybody liked these forms and liked the space,,and so that's one of the problems of a competition.,You have to then try and get that back in some way.,And we studied many models.,This was our original model.,These were the three buildings that were the ideal --,the Concertgebouw, Boston and Berlin.,Everybody liked the surround.,Actually, this is the smallest hall in size,,and it has more seats than any of these,because it has double balconies.,Our client doesn't want balconies, so --,and when we met our new acoustician, he told us,this was the right shape or this was the right shape.,And we tried many shapes, trying to get the energy,of the original design within an acoustical, acceptable format.,We finally settled on a shape that was,the proportion of the Concertgebouw,with the sloping outside walls, which the acoustician said,were crucial to this and later decided they weren't,,but now we have them. 
 (Laughter) 
 And our idea is to make the seating carriage very sculptural,and out of wood and like a big boat sitting in this plaster room.,That's the idea.,And the corners would have skylights,and these columns would be structural.,And the nice thing about introducing columns is they give you a,kind of sense of proscenium from wherever you sit,,and create intimacy.,Now, this is not a final design -- these are just on the way to being --,and so I wouldn't take it literally, except the feeling of the space.,We studied the acoustics with laser stuff,,and they bounce them off this and see where it all works.,But you get the sense of the hall in section.,Most halls come straight down into a proscenium.,In this case we're opening it back up,and getting skylights in the four corners.,And so it will be quite a different shape. 
 (Laughter) 
 The original building, because it was frog-like,,fit nicely on the site and cranked itself well.,When you get into a box, it's harder to do it -- and here we are,,struggling with how to put the hotel in.,And this is a teapot I designed for Alessi.,I just stuck it on there.,But this is how I do work. I do take pieces and bits and look at it,and struggle with it and cut it away.,And of course it's not going to look like that,,but it is the crazy way I tend to work. 
 And then finally, in L.A. I was asked to do a sculpture,at the foot of Interstate Bank Tower, the highest building in L.A.,Larry Halprin is doing the stairs.,And I was asked to do a fish, and so I did a snake. 
 (Laughter) 
 It's a public space, and I made it kind of a garden structure,,and you can go in it.,It's a kiva, and Larry's putting some water in there,,and it works much better than a fish. 
 In Barcelona I was asked to do a fish, and we're working on that,,at the foot of a Ritz-Carlton Tower being done by,Skidmore, Owings and Merrill.,And the Ritz-Carlton Tower is being designed with exposed steel,,non-fire proof, much like those old gas tanks.,And so we took the language of this exposed steel and used it,,perverted it, into the form of the fish, and created a kind of,a 19th-century contraption that looks like, that will sit --,this is the beach and the harbor out in front,,and this is really a shopping center with department stores.,And we split these bridges.,Originally, this was all solid with a hole in it.,We cut them loose and made several bridges and created a kind of,a foreground for this hotel.,We showed this to the hotel people the other day,,and they were terrified and said that nobody would come,to the Ritz-Carlton anymore, because of this fish. 
 (Laughter) 
 And finally, I just threw these in -- Lou Danziger.,I didn't expect Lou Danziger to be here,,but this is a building I did for him in 1964, I think.,A little studio -- and it's sadly for sale.,Time goes on. 
 And this is my son working with me on a small fast-food thing.,He designed the robot as the cashier, and the head moves,,and I did the rest of it.,And the food wasn't as good as the stuff, and so it failed.,It should have been the other way around --,the food should have been good first.,It didn't work. 
 Thank you very much.Because I usually take the role,of trying to explain to people,how wonderful the new technologies,that are coming along are going to be,,and I thought that, since I was among friends here,,I would tell you what I really think,and try to look back and try to understand,what is really going on here,with these amazing jumps in technology,that seem so fast that we can barely keep on top of it. 
 So I'm going to start out,by showing just one very boring technology slide.,And then, so if you can just turn on the slide that's on.,This is just a random slide,that I picked out of my file.,What I want to show you is not so much the details of the slide,,but the general form of it.,This happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing,about the power of RISC microprocessors,versus the power of local area networks.,And the interesting thing about it,is that this slide,,like so many technology slides that we're used to,,is a sort of a straight line,on a semi-log curve.,In other words, every step here,represents an order of magnitude,in performance scale.,And this is a new thing,that we talk about technology,on semi-log curves.,Something really weird is going on here.,And that's basically what I'm going to be talking about. 
 So, if you could bring up the lights.,If you could bring up the lights higher,,because I'm just going to use a piece of paper here.,Now why do we draw technology curves,in semi-log curves?,Well the answer is, if I drew it on a normal curve,where, let's say, this is years,,this is time of some sort,,and this is whatever measure of the technology,that I'm trying to graph,,the graphs look sort of silly.,They sort of go like this.,And they don't tell us much.,Now if I graph, for instance,,some other technology, say transportation technology,,on a semi-log curve,,it would look very stupid, it would look like a flat line.,But when something like this happens,,things are qualitatively changing.,So if transportation technology,was moving along as fast as microprocessor technology,,then the day after tomorrow,,I would be able to get in a taxi cab,and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.,It's not moving like that.,And there's nothing precedented,in the history of technology development,of this kind of self-feeding growth,where you go by orders of magnitude every few years. 
 Now the question that I'd like to ask is,,if you look at these exponential curves,,they don't go on forever.,Things just can't possibly keep changing,as fast as they are.,One of two things is going to happen.,Either it's going to turn into a sort of classical S-curve like this,,until something totally different comes along,,or maybe it's going to do this.,That's about all it can do.,Now I'm an optimist,,so I sort of think it's probably going to do something like that.,If so, that means that what we're in the middle of right now,is a transition.,We're sort of on this line,in a transition from the way the world used to be,to some new way that the world is.,And so what I'm trying to ask, what I've been asking myself,,is what's this new way that the world is?,What's that new state that the world is heading toward?,Because the transition seems very, very confusing,when we're right in the middle of it. 
 Now when I was a kid growing up,,the future was kind of the year 2000,,and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.,Now here's a conference,in which people talk about the future,,and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000.,It's about as far as we go out.,So in other words, the future has kind of been shrinking,one year per year,for my whole lifetime.,Now I think that the reason,is because we all feel,that something's happening there.,That transition is happening. We can all sense it.,And we know that it just doesn't make too much sense,to think out 30, 50 years,because everything's going to be so different,that a simple extrapolation of what we're doing,just doesn't make any sense at all. 
 So what I would like to talk about,is what that could be,,what that transition could be that we're going through.,Now in order to do that,I'm going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff,that really has nothing to do,with technology and computers.,Because I think the only way to understand this,is to really step back,and take a long time scale look at things.,So the time scale that I would like to look at this on,is the time scale of life on Earth.,So I think this picture makes sense,if you look at it a few billion years at a time. 
 So if you go back,about two and a half billion years,,the Earth was this big, sterile hunk of rock,with a lot of chemicals floating around on it.,And if you look at the way,that the chemicals got organized,,we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it.,And I think that there's theories that are beginning to understand,about how it started with RNA,,but I'm going to tell a sort of simple story of it,,which is that, at that time,,there were little drops of oil floating around,with all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them.,And some of those drops of oil,had a particular combination of chemicals in them,which caused them to incorporate chemicals from the outside,and grow the drops of oil.,And those that were like that,started to split and divide.,And those were the most primitive forms of cells in a sense,,those little drops of oil. 
 But now those drops of oil weren't really alive, as we say it now,,because every one of them,was a little random recipe of chemicals.,And every time it divided,,they got sort of unequal division,of the chemicals within them.,And so every drop was a little bit different.,In fact, the drops that were different in a way,that caused them to be better,at incorporating chemicals around them,,grew more and incorporated more chemicals and divided more.,So those tended to live longer,,get expressed more. 
 Now that's sort of just a very simple,chemical form of life,,but when things got interesting,was when these drops,learned a trick about abstraction.,Somehow by ways that we don't quite understand,,these little drops learned to write down information.,They learned to record the information,that was the recipe of the cell,onto a particular kind of chemical,called DNA.,So in other words, they worked out,,in this mindless sort of evolutionary way,,a form of writing that let them write down what they were,,so that that way of writing it down could get copied.,The amazing thing is that that way of writing,seems to have stayed steady,since it evolved two and a half billion years ago.,In fact the recipe for us, our genes,,is exactly that same code and that same way of writing.,In fact, every living creature is written,in exactly the same set of letters and the same code. 
 In fact, one of the things that I did,just for amusement purposes,is we can now write things in this code.,And I've got here a little 100 micrograms of white powder,,which I try not to let the security people see at airports.,(Laughter),But this has in it --,what I did is I took this code --,the code has standard letters that we use for symbolizing it --,and I wrote my business card onto a piece of DNA,and amplified it 10 to the 22 times.,So if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card,,I have plenty for everyone in the room,,and, in fact, everyone in the world,,and it's right here.,(Laughter),If I had really been a egotist,,I would have put it into a virus and released it in the room. 
 (Laughter) 
 So what was the next step?,Writing down the DNA was an interesting step.,And that caused these cells --,that kept them happy for another billion years.,But then there was another really interesting step,where things became completely different,,which is these cells started exchanging and communicating information,,so that they began to get communities of cells.,I don't know if you know this,,but bacteria can actually exchange DNA.,Now that's why, for instance,,antibiotic resistance has evolved.,Some bacteria figured out how to stay away from penicillin,,and it went around sort of creating its little DNA information,with other bacteria,,and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin,,because bacteria communicate.,Now what this communication allowed,was communities to form,that, in some sense, were in the same boat together;,they were synergistic.,So they survived,or they failed together,,which means that if a community was very successful,,all the individuals in that community,were repeated more,and they were favored by evolution. 
 Now the transition point happened,when these communities got so close,that, in fact, they got together,and decided to write down the whole recipe for the community,together on one string of DNA.,And so the next stage that's interesting in life,took about another billion years.,And at that stage,,we have multi-cellular communities,,communities of lots of different types of cells,,working together as a single organism.,And in fact, we're such a multi-cellular community.,We have lots of cells,that are not out for themselves anymore.,Your skin cell is really useless,without a heart cell, muscle cell,,a brain cell and so on.,So these communities began to evolve,so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place,was no longer a cell,,but a community which we call an organism. 
 Now the next step that happened,is within these communities.,These communities of cells,,again, began to abstract information.,And they began building very special structures,that did nothing but process information within the community.,And those are the neural structures.,So neurons are the information processing apparatus,that those communities of cells built up.,And in fact, they began to get specialists in the community,and special structures,that were responsible for recording,,understanding, learning information.,And that was the brains and the nervous system,of those communities.,And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.,Because at that point,,an individual --,learning could happen,within the time span of a single organism,,instead of over this evolutionary time span. 
 So an organism could, for instance,,learn not to eat a certain kind of fruit,because it tasted bad and it got sick last time it ate it.,That could happen within the lifetime of a single organism,,whereas before they'd built these special information processing structures,,that would have had to be learned evolutionarily,over hundreds of thousands of years,by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fruit.,So that nervous system,,the fact that they built these special information structures,,tremendously sped up the whole process of evolution.,Because evolution could now happen within an individual.,It could happen in learning time scales. 
 But then what happened,was the individuals worked out,,of course, tricks of communicating.,And for example,,the most sophisticated version that we're aware of is human language.,It's really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it.,Here I have a very complicated, messy,,confused idea in my head.,I'm sitting here making grunting sounds basically,,and hopefully constructing a similar messy, confused idea in your head,that bears some analogy to it.,But we're taking something very complicated,,turning it into sound, sequences of sounds,,and producing something very complicated in your brain.,So this allows us now,to begin to start functioning,as a single organism. 
 And so, in fact, what we've done,is we, humanity,,have started abstracting out.,We're going through the same levels,that multi-cellular organisms have gone through --,abstracting out our methods of recording,,presenting, processing information.,So for example, the invention of language,was a tiny step in that direction.,Telephony, computers,,videotapes, CD-ROMs and so on,are all our specialized mechanisms,that we've now built within our society,for handling that information.,And it all connects us together,into something,that is much bigger,and much faster,and able to evolve,than what we were before.,So now, evolution can take place,on a scale of microseconds.,And you saw Ty's little evolutionary example,where he sort of did a little bit of evolution,on the Convolution program right before your eyes. 
 So now we've speeded up the time scales once again.,So the first steps of the story that I told you about,took a billion years a piece.,And the next steps,,like nervous systems and brains,,took a few hundred million years.,Then the next steps, like language and so on,,took less than a million years.,And these next steps, like electronics,,seem to be taking only a few decades.,The process is feeding on itself,and becoming, I guess, autocatalytic is the word for it --,when something reinforces its rate of change.,The more it changes, the faster it changes.,And I think that that's what we're seeing here in this explosion of curve.,We're seeing this process feeding back on itself. 
 Now I design computers for a living,,and I know that the mechanisms,that I use to design computers,would be impossible,without recent advances in computers.,So right now, what I do,is I design objects at such complexity,that it's really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense.,I don't know what every transistor in the connection machine does.,There are billions of them.,Instead, what I do,and what the designers at Thinking Machines do,is we think at some level of abstraction,and then we hand it to the machine,and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do,,much farther and faster than we could ever do.,And in fact, sometimes it takes it by methods,that we don't quite even understand. 
 One method that's particularly interesting,that I've been using a lot lately,is evolution itself.,So what we do,is we put inside the machine,a process of evolution,that takes place on the microsecond time scale.,So for example,,in the most extreme cases,,we can actually evolve a program,by starting out with random sequences of instructions.,Say, "Computer, would you please make,a hundred million random sequences of instructions.,Now would you please run all of those random sequences of instructions,,run all of those programs,,and pick out the ones that came closest to doing what I wanted.",So in other words, I define what I wanted.,Let's say I want to sort numbers,,as a simple example I've done it with.,So find the programs that come closest to sorting numbers. 
 So of course, random sequences of instructions,are very unlikely to sort numbers,,so none of them will really do it.,But one of them, by luck,,may put two numbers in the right order.,And I say, "Computer,,would you please now take the 10 percent,of those random sequences that did the best job.,Save those. Kill off the rest.,And now let's reproduce,the ones that sorted numbers the best.,And let's reproduce them by a process of recombination,analogous to sex.",Take two programs and they produce children,by exchanging their subroutines,,and the children inherit the traits of the subroutines of the two programs.,So I've got now a new generation of programs,that are produced by combinations,of the programs that did a little bit better job.,Say, "Please repeat that process.",Score them again.,Introduce some mutations perhaps.,And try that again and do that for another generation. 
 Well every one of those generations just takes a few milliseconds.,So I can do the equivalent,of millions of years of evolution on that,within the computer in a few minutes,,or in the complicated cases, in a few hours.,At the end of that, I end up with programs,that are absolutely perfect at sorting numbers.,In fact, they are programs that are much more efficient,than programs I could have ever written by hand. 
 Now if I look at those programs,,I can't tell you how they work.,I've tried looking at them and telling you how they work.,They're obscure, weird programs.,But they do the job.,And in fact, I know, I'm very confident that they do the job,because they come from a line,of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job.,In fact, their life depended on doing the job. 
 (Laughter) 
 I was riding in a 747,with Marvin Minsky once,,and he pulls out this card and says, "Oh look. Look at this.,It says, 'This plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts,working together to make you a safe flight.',Doesn't that make you feel confident?" 
 (Laughter) 
 In fact, we know that the engineering process doesn't work very well,when it gets complicated.,So we're beginning to depend on computers,to do a process that's very different than engineering.,And it lets us produce things of much more complexity,than normal engineering lets us produce.,And yet, we don't quite understand the options of it.,So in a sense, it's getting ahead of us.,We're now using those programs,to make much faster computers,so that we'll be able to run this process much faster.,So it's feeding back on itself.,The thing is becoming faster,and that's why I think it seems so confusing.,Because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves.,We're taking off. 
 And what we are is we're at a point in time,which is analogous to when single-celled organisms,were turning into multi-celled organisms.,So we're the amoebas,and we can't quite figure out what the hell this thing is we're creating.,We're right at that point of transition.,But I think that there really is something coming along after us.,I think it's very haughty of us,to think that we're the end product of evolution.,And I think all of us here,are a part of producing,whatever that next thing is.,So lunch is coming along,,and I think I will stop at that point,,before I get selected out. 
 (Applause)Sheryl Shade: Hi, Aimee. Aimee Mullins: Hi. 
 SS: Aimee and I thought we'd just talk a little bit,,and I wanted her to tell all of you what makes her a distinctive athlete. 
 AM: Well, for those of you who have seen the picture in the little bio --,it might have given it away --,I'm a double amputee, and I was born without fibulas in both legs.,I was amputated at age one,,and I've been running like hell ever since, all over the place. 
 SS: Well, why don't you tell them how you got to Georgetown -- why don't we start there?,Why don't we start there? 
 AM: I'm a senior in Georgetown in the Foreign Service program.,I won a full academic scholarship out of high school.,They pick three students out of the nation every year,to get involved in international affairs,,and so I won a full ride to Georgetown,and I've been there for four years. Love it. 
 SS: When Aimee got there,,she decided that she's, kind of, curious about track and field,,so she decided to call someone and start asking about it.,So, why don't you tell that story? 
 AM: Yeah. Well, I guess I've always been involved in sports.,I played softball for five years growing up.,I skied competitively throughout high school,,and I got a little restless in college,because I wasn't doing anything for about a year or two sports-wise.,And I'd never competed on a disabled level, you know --,I'd always competed against other able-bodied athletes.,That's all I'd ever known.,In fact, I'd never even met another amputee until I was 17.,And I heard that they do these track meets with all disabled runners,,and I figured, "Oh, I don't know about this,,but before I judge it, let me go see what it's all about.",So, I booked myself a flight to Boston in '95, 19 years old,and definitely the dark horse candidate at this race. I'd never done it before.,I went out on a gravel track a couple of weeks before this meet,to see how far I could run,,and about 50 meters was enough for me, panting and heaving.,And I had these legs that were made of,a wood and plastic compound, attached with Velcro straps --,big, thick, five-ply wool socks on --,you know, not the most comfortable things, but all I'd ever known. 
 And I'm up there in Boston against people,wearing legs made of all things -- carbon graphite,and, you know, shock absorbers in them and all sorts of things --,and they're all looking at me like,,OK, we know who's not going to win this race.,And, I mean, I went up there expecting --,I don't know what I was expecting --,but, you know, when I saw a man who was missing an entire leg,go up to the high jump, hop on one leg to the high jump,and clear it at six feet, two inches ...,Dan O'Brien jumped 5'11" in '96 in Atlanta,,I mean, if it just gives you a comparison of --,these are truly accomplished athletes,,without qualifying that word "athlete.",And so I decided to give this a shot: heart pounding,,I ran my first race and I beat the national record-holder,by three hundredths of a second,,and became the new national record-holder on my first try out. 
 And, you know, people said,,"Aimee, you know, you've got speed -- you've got natural speed --,but you don't have any skill or finesse going down that track.,You were all over the place.,We all saw how hard you were working.",And so I decided to call the track coach at Georgetown.,And I thank god I didn't know just how huge this man is in the track and field world.,He's coached five Olympians, and,the man's office is lined from floor to ceiling,with All America certificates,of all these athletes he's coached.,He's just a rather intimidating figure.,And I called him up and said, "Listen, I ran one race and I won ..." 
 (Laughter) 
 "I want to see if I can, you know --,I need to just see if I can sit in on some of your practices,,see what drills you do and whatever.",That's all I wanted -- just two practices.,"Can I just sit in and see what you do?",And he said, "Well, we should meet first, before we decide anything.",You know, he's thinking, "What am I getting myself into?",So, I met the man, walked in his office,,and saw these posters and magazine covers of people he has coached.,And we got to talking,,and it turned out to be a great partnership,because he'd never coached a disabled athlete,,so therefore he had no preconceived notions,of what I was or wasn't capable of,,and I'd never been coached before.,So this was like, "Here we go -- let's start on this trip." 
 So he started giving me four days a week of his lunch break,,his free time, and I would come up to the track and train with him.,So that's how I met Frank.,That was fall of '95. But then, by the time that winter was rolling around,,he said, "You know, you're good enough.,You can run on our women's track team here.",And I said, "No, come on.",And he said, "No, no, really. You can.,You can run with our women's track team.",In the spring of 1996, with my goal of making the U.S. Paralympic team,that May coming up full speed, I joined the women's track team.,And no disabled person had ever done that -- run at a collegiate level.,So I don't know, it started to become an interesting mix. 
 SS: Well, on your way to the Olympics,,a couple of memorable events happened at Georgetown.,Why don't you just tell them?,AM: Yes, well, you know, I'd won everything as far as the disabled meets --,everything I competed in -- and, you know, training in Georgetown,and knowing that I was going to have to get used to,seeing the backs of all these women's shirts --,you know, I'm running against the next Flo-Jo --,and they're all looking at me like,,"Hmm, what's, you know, what's going on here?",And putting on my Georgetown uniform,and going out there and knowing that, you know,,in order to become better -- and I'm already the best in the country --,you know, you have to train with people who are inherently better than you. 
 And I went out there and made it to the Big East,,which was sort of the championship race at the end of the season.,It was really, really hot.,And it's the first --,I had just gotten these new sprinting legs that you see in that bio,,and I didn't realize at that time that,the amount of sweating I would be doing in the sock --,it actually acted like a lubricant,and I'd be, kind of, pistoning in the socket.,And at about 85 meters of my 100 meters sprint, in all my glory,,I came out of my leg.,Like, I almost came out of it, in front of, like, 5,000 people.,And I, I mean, was just mortified --,because I was signed up for the 200, you know, which went off in a half hour. 
 (Laughter) 
 I went to my coach: "Please, don't make me do this.",I can't do this in front of all those people. My legs will come off.,And if it came off at 85 there's no way I'm going 200 meters.,And he just sat there like this.,My pleas fell on deaf ears, thank god.,Because you know, the man is from Brooklyn;,he's a big man. He says, "Aimee, so what if your leg falls off?,You pick it up, you put the damn thing back on,,and finish the goddamn race!" 
 (Laughter) (Applause),And I did. So, he kept me in line.,He kept me on the right track. 
 SS: So, then Aimee makes it to the 1996 Paralympics,,and she's all excited. Her family's coming down -- it's a big deal.,It's now two years that you've been running? 
 AM: No, a year. 
 SS: A year. And why don't you tell them what happened,right before you go run your race? 
 AM: Okay, well, Atlanta.,The Paralympics, just for a little bit of clarification,,are the Olympics for people with physical disabilities --,amputees, persons with cerebral palsy, and wheelchair athletes --,as opposed to the Special Olympics,,which deals with people with mental disabilities.,So, here we are, a week after the Olympics and down at Atlanta,,and I'm just blown away by the fact that,just a year ago, I got out on a gravel track and couldn't run 50 meters.,And so, here I am -- never lost.,I set new records at the U.S. Nationals -- the Olympic trials -- that May,,and was sure that I was coming home with the gold.,I was also the only, what they call "bilateral BK" -- below the knee.,I was the only woman who would be doing the long jump.,I had just done the long jump,,and a guy who was missing two legs came up to me and says,,"How do you do that? You know, we're supposed to have a planar foot,,so we can't get off on the springboard.",I said, "Well, I just did it. No one told me that." 
 So, it's funny -- I'm three inches within the world record --,and kept on from that point, you know,,so I'm signed up in the long jump -- signed up?,No, I made it for the long jump and the 100-meter.,And I'm sure of it, you know?,I made the front page of my hometown paper,that I delivered for six years, you know?,It was, like, this is my time for shine.,And we're at the trainee warm-up track,,which is a few blocks away from the Olympic stadium.,These legs that I was on, which I'll take out right now --,I was the first person in the world on these legs.,I was the guinea pig., I'm telling you,,this was, like -- talk about a tourist attraction. 
 Everyone was taking pictures -- "What is this girl running on?",And I'm always looking around, like, where is my competition?,It's my first international meet.,I tried to get it out of anybody I could,,you know, "Who am I running against here?","Oh, Aimee, we'll have to get back to you on that one.",I wanted to find out times.,"Don't worry, you're doing great.",This is 20 minutes before my race in the Olympic stadium,,and they post the heat sheets. And I go over and look.,And my fastest time, which was the world record, was 15.77.,Then I'm looking: the next lane, lane two, is 12.8.,Lane three is 12.5. Lane four is 12.2. I said, "What's going on?",And they shove us all into the shuttle bus,,and all the women there are missing a hand. 
 (Laughter) 
 So, I'm just, like --,they're all looking at me like 'which one of these is not like the other,' you know?,I'm sitting there, like, "Oh, my god. Oh, my god.",You know, I'd never lost anything,,like, whether it would be the scholarship or, you know,,I'd won five golds when I skied. In everything, I came in first.,And Georgetown -- that was great.,I was losing, but it was the best training because this was Atlanta.,Here we are, like, crème de la crème,,and there is no doubt about it, that I'm going to lose big.,And, you know, I'm just thinking,,"Oh, my god, my whole family got in a van,and drove down here from Pennsylvania.",And, you know, I was the only female U.S. sprinter.,So they call us out and, you know --,"Ladies, you have one minute.",And I remember putting my blocks in and just feeling horrified,because there was just this murmur coming over the crowd,,like, the ones who are close enough to the starting line to see.,And I'm like, "I know! Look! This isn't right.",And I'm thinking that's my last card to play here;,if I'm not going to beat these girls,,I'm going to mess their heads a little, you know? 
 (Laughter) 
 I mean, it was definitely the "Rocky IV" sensation of me versus Germany,,and everyone else -- Estonia and Poland -- was in this heat.,And the gun went off, and all I remember was,finishing last and,fighting back tears of frustration and incredible -- incredible --,this feeling of just being overwhelmed.,And I had to think, "Why did I do this?",If I had won everything -- but it was like, what was the point?,All this training -- I had transformed my life.,I became a collegiate athlete, you know. I became an Olympic athlete.,And it made me really think about how,the achievement was getting there.,I mean, the fact that I set my sights, just a year and three months before,,on becoming an Olympic athlete and saying,,"Here's my life going in this direction --,and I want to take it here for a while,,and just seeing how far I could push it." 
 And the fact that I asked for help -- how many people jumped on board?,How many people gave of their time and their expertise,,and their patience, to deal with me?,And that was this collective glory --,that there was, you know, 50 people behind me,that had joined in this incredible experience of going to Atlanta.,So, I apply this sort of philosophy now,to everything I do:,sitting back and realizing the progression,,how far you've come at this day to this goal, you know.,It's important to focus on a goal, I think, but,also recognize the progression on the way there,and how you've grown as a person.,That's the achievement, I think. That's the real achievement. 
 SS: Why don't you show them your legs? 
 AM: Oh, sure.,SS: You know, show us more than one set of legs. 
 AM: Well, these are my pretty legs. 
 (Laughter) 
 No, these are my cosmetic legs, actually,,and they're absolutely beautiful.,You've got to come up and see them.,There are hair follicles on them, and I can paint my toenails.,And, seriously, like, I can wear heels.,Like, you guys don't understand what that's like,to be able to just go into a shoe store and buy whatever you want.,SS: You got to pick your height?,AM: I got to pick my height, exactly. 
 (Laughter) 
 Patrick Ewing, who played for Georgetown in the '80s,,comes back every summer.,And I had incessant fun making fun of him in the training room,because he'd come in with foot injuries.,I'm like, "Get it off! Don't worry about it, you know.,You can be eight feet tall. Just take them off." 
 (Laughter) 
 He didn't find it as humorous as I did, anyway.,OK, now, these are my sprinting legs, made of carbon graphite,,like I said, and I've got to make sure I've got the right socket.,No, I've got so many legs in here.,These are -- do you want to hold that actually?,That's another leg I have for, like, tennis and softball.,It has a shock absorber in it so it, like, "Shhhh," makes this neat sound,when you jump around on it. All right.,And then this is the silicon sheath I roll over,,to keep it on. Which, when I sweat,,you know, I'm pistoning out of it. 
 SS: Are you a different height? 
 AM: In these? 
 SS: In these. 
 AM: I don't know. I don't think so.,I may be a little taller. I actually can put both of them on. 
 SS: She can't really stand on these legs. She has to be moving, so ... 
 AM: Yeah, I definitely have to be moving,,and balance is a little bit of an art in them.,But without having the silicon sock, I'm just going to try slip in it.,And so, I run on these, and have shocked half the world on these. 
 (Applause) 
 These are supposed to simulate the actual form of a sprinter when they run.,If you ever watch a sprinter,,the ball of their foot is the only thing that ever hits the track.,So when I stand in these legs,,my hamstring and my glutes are contracted,,as they would be had I had feet and were standing on the ball of my feet. 
 (Audience: Who made them?) 
 AM: It's a company in San Diego called Flex-Foot.,And I was a guinea pig, as I hope to continue to be,in every new form of prosthetic limbs that come out.,But actually these, like I said, are still the actual prototype.,I need to get some new ones because the last meet I was at, they were everywhere. You know,,it's like a big -- it's come full circle. 
 Moderator: Aimee and the designer of them will be at TEDMED 2,,and we'll talk about the design of them. 
 AM: Yes, we'll do that. 
 SS: Yes, there you go. 
 AM: So, these are the sprint legs, and I can put my other... 
 SS: Can you tell about who designed your other legs? 
 AM: Yes. These I got in a place called Bournemouth, England,,about two hours south of London,,and I'm the only person in the United States with these,,which is a crime because they are so beautiful.,And I don't even mean, like, because of the toes and everything.,For me, while I'm such a serious athlete on the track,,I want to be feminine off the track, and I think it's so important,not to be limited in any capacity,,whether it's, you know, your mobility or even fashion.,I mean, I love the fact that I can go in anywhere,and pick out what I want -- the shoes I want, the skirts I want --,and I'm hoping to try to bring these over here,and make them accessible to a lot of people.,They're also silicon.,This is a really basic, basic prosthetic limb under here.,It's like a Barbie foot under this. 
 (Laughter) 
 It is. It's just stuck in this position,,so I have to wear a two-inch heel.,And, I mean, it's really -- let me take this off so you can see it.,I don't know how good you can see it, but, like, it really is.,There're veins on the feet, and then my heel is pink,,and my Achilles' tendon -- that moves a little bit.,And it's really an amazing store. I got them a year and two weeks ago.,And this is just a silicon piece of skin.,I mean, what happened was, two years ago,this man in Belgium was saying, "God,,if I can go to Madame Tussauds' wax museum,and see Jerry Hall replicated down to the color of her eyes,,looking so real as if she breathed,,why can't they build a limb for someone,that looks like a leg, or an arm, or a hand?",I mean, they make ears for burn victims.,They do amazing stuff with silicon. 
 SS: Two weeks ago, Aimee was up for the Arthur Ashe award at the ESPYs.,And she came into town and she rushed around,and she said, "I have to buy some new shoes!",We're an hour before the ESPYs,,and she thought she'd gotten a two-inch heel,but she'd actually bought a three-inch heel. 
 AM: And this poses a problem for me,,because it means I'm walking like that all night long. 
 SS: For 45 minutes. Luckily, the hotel was terrific.,They got someone to come in and saw off the shoes. 
 (Laughter) 
 AM: I said to the receptionist -- I mean, I am just harried, and Sheryl's at my side --,I said, "Look, do you have anybody here who could help me?,Because I have this problem ... ",You know, at first they were just going to write me off, like,,"If you don't like your shoes, sorry. It's too late.","No, no, no, no. I've got these special feet,that need a two-inch heel. I have a three-inch heel.,I need a little bit off.",They didn't even want to go there.,They didn't even want to touch that one. They just did it.,No, these legs are great.,I'm actually going back in a couple of weeks,to get some improvements.,I want to get legs like these made for flat feet,so I can wear sneakers, because I can't with these ones.,So... Moderator: That's it. 
 SS: That's Aimee Mullins. 
 (Applause)As a clergyman,,you can imagine how,out of place I feel.,I feel like a fish out of water,,or maybe an owl out of the air. 
 (Laughter) 
 I was preaching in San Jose some time ago,,and my friend Mark Kvamme,,who helped introduce me,to this conference,,brought several CEOs,and leaders,of some of the companies here in the Silicon Valley,to have breakfast with me, or I with them.,And I was so stimulated.,And had such -- it was an,eye-opening experience,to hear them talk about,the world that is yet to come,through technology,and science.,I know that we're near the end of this conference,,and some of you may be wondering,why they have a speaker,from the field of religion.,Richard can answer that,,because he made that decision. 
 But some years ago I was on an elevator in Philadelphia,,coming down.,I was to address a conference,at a hotel.,And on that elevator a man said,,"I hear Billy Graham is staying in this hotel.",And another man looked in my direction and said,,"Yes, there he is. He's on this elevator with us.",And this man looked me up and down,for about 10 seconds,,and he said, "My, what an anticlimax!" 
 (Laughter) 
 I hope,that you won't feel that these few moments with me,is not a -- is an anticlimax,,after all these tremendous,talks that you've heard,,and addresses, which I intend to listen to every one of them.,But I was,on an airplane in the east some years ago,,and the man sitting across the aisle from me,was the mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina.,His name was John Belk. Some of you will probably know him.,And there was a drunk man on there,,and he got up out of his seat two or three times,,and he was making everybody upset,by what he was trying to do.,And he was slapping the stewardess,and pinching her as she went by,,and everybody was upset with him.,And finally, John Belk said,,"Do you know who's sitting here?",And the man said, "No, who?",He said, "It's Billy Graham,,the preacher.",He said, "You don't say!",And he turned to me, and he said, "Put her there!",He said, "Your sermons have certainly helped me." 
 (Laughter) 
 And I suppose that that's true,with thousands of people. 
 (Laughter) 
 I know that as you have been peering into the future,,and as we've heard some of it here tonight,,I would like to live in that age,and see what is going to be.,But I won't,,because I'm 80 years old. This is my eightieth year,,and I know that my time is brief.,I have phlebitis at the moment, in both legs,,and that's the reason that I had to have a little help in getting up here,,because I have Parkinson's disease,in addition to that,,and some other problems that I won't talk about. 
 (Laughter) 
 But this is not the first time,that we've had a technological revolution.,We've had others.,And there's one that I want to talk about.,In one generation,,the nation of the people of Israel,had a tremendous and dramatic change,that made them a great power in the Near East.,A man by the name of David,came to the throne,,and King David became one of the great leaders,of his generation.,He was a man of tremendous leadership.,He had the favor of God with him.,He was a brilliant poet,,philosopher, writer, soldier --,with strategies in battle and conflict,that people study even today. 
 But about two centuries before David,,the Hittites,had discovered the secret,of smelting and processing of iron,,and, slowly, that skill spread.,But they wouldn't allow the Israelis,to look into it, or to have any.,But David changed all of that,,and he introduced the Iron Age,to Israel.,And the Bible says that David laid up great stores of iron,,and which archaeologists have found,,that in present-day Palestine,,there are evidences of that generation.,Now, instead of crude tools,made of sticks and stones,,Israel now had iron plows,,and sickles, and hoes,and military weapons.,And in the course of one generation,,Israel was completely changed.,The introduction of iron, in some ways,,had an impact,a little bit like the microchip,has had on our generation.,And,David found,that there were many problems that technology could not solve. 
 There were many problems still left.,And they're still with us, and you haven't solved them,,and I haven't heard anybody here speak to that.,How do we solve these three problems,that I'd like to mention?,The first one that David saw,was human evil.,Where does it come from?,How do we solve it?,Over again and again,in the Psalms,,which Gladstone said was the greatest book in the world,,David describes the evils of the human race.,And yet he says,,"He restores my soul.",Have you ever thought about what a contradiction we are?,On one hand, we can probe the deepest secrets of the universe,and dramatically push back the frontiers of technology,,as this conference vividly demonstrates.,We've seen under the sea,,three miles down,,or galaxies hundreds of billions of years,out in the future. 
 But on the other hand,,something is wrong.,Our battleships,,our soldiers,,are on a frontier now,,almost ready to go to war,with Iraq.,Now, what causes this?,Why do we have these wars in every generation,,and in every part of the world?,And revolutions?,We can't get along with other people,,even in our own families.,We find ourselves in the paralyzing grip,of self-destructive habits we can't break.,Racism and injustice and violence sweep our world,,bringing a tragic harvest of heartache and death.,Even the most sophisticated among us,seem powerless to break this cycle.,I would like to see Oracle,take up that,,or,some other,technological geniuses work on this.,How do we change man,,so that he doesn't lie and cheat,,and our newspapers are not filled with stories,of fraud in business or labor,or athletics or wherever? 
 The Bible says the problem is within us,,within our hearts and our souls.,Our problem is that we are separated,from our Creator,,which we call God,,and we need to have our souls restored,,something only God can do.,Jesus said, "For out of the heart,come evil thoughts:,murders, sexual immorality,,theft, false testimonies,,slander.",The British philosopher Bertrand Russell,was not a religious man,,but he said, "It's in our hearts that the evil lies,,and it's from our hearts,that it must be plucked out.",Albert Einstein --,I was just talking to someone, when I was speaking at Princeton,,and I met,Mr. Einstein.,He didn't have a doctor's degree, because he said,nobody was qualified to give him one. 
 (Laughter) 
 But he made this statement.,He said, "It's easier to denature plutonium,than to denature the evil spirit of man.",And many of you, I'm sure,,have thought about that,and puzzled over it.,You've seen people,take beneficial technological advances,,such as the Internet we've heard about tonight,,and twist them into something corrupting.,You've seen brilliant people devise computer viruses,that bring down whole systems.,The Oklahoma City bombing was simple technology,,horribly used.,The problem is not technology.,The problem is the person or persons using it.,King David said,that he knew the depths of his own soul.,He couldn't free himself from personal problems,and personal evils,that included murder and adultery.,Yet King David sought God's forgiveness,,and said, "You can restore my soul." 
 You see, the Bible teaches,that we're more than a body and a mind.,We are a soul.,And there's something inside of us,that is beyond our understanding.,That's the part of us that yearns,for God, or something more,than we find in technology.,Your soul is that part of you that,yearns for meaning in life,,and which seeks for something beyond this life.,It's the part of you that yearns, really, for God.,I find [that] young people all over the world,are searching for something.,They don't know what it is. I speak at many universities,,and I have many questions and answer periods, and,whether it's Cambridge, or Harvard,,or Oxford --,I've spoken at all of those universities.,I'm going to Harvard in about three or four --,no, it's about two months from now --,to give a lecture.,And I'll be asked the same questions that I was asked,the last few times I've been there.,And it'll be on,these questions:,where did I come from? Why am I here? Where am I going?,What's life all about? Why am I here? 
 Even if you have no religious belief,,there are times when you wonder that there's something else.,Thomas Edison also said,,"When you see everything that happens in the world of science,,and in the working of the universe,,you cannot deny that there's a captain on the bridge.",I remember once,,I sat beside Mrs. Gorbachev,at a White House dinner.,I went to Ambassador Dobrynin, whom I knew very well.,And I'd been to Russia several times under the Communists,,and they'd given me marvelous freedom that I didn't expect.,And I knew Mr. Dobrynin very well,,and I said,,"I'm going to sit beside Mrs. Gorbachev tonight.,What shall I talk to her about?",And he surprised me with the answer.,He said, "Talk to her about religion and philosophy.,That's what she's really interested in.",I was a little bit surprised, but that evening,that's what we talked about,,and it was a stimulating conversation.,And afterward, she said,,"You know, I'm an atheist,,but I know that there's something up there,higher than we are." 
 The second problem,that King David realized he could not solve,was the problem of human suffering.,Writing the oldest book in the world was Job,,and he said,,"Man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward.",Yes, to be sure, science has done much to push back,certain types of human suffering.,But I'm --,in a few months, I'll be 80 years of age.,I admit that I'm very grateful,for all the medical advances,that have kept me in relatively good health,all these years.,My doctors at the Mayo Clinic urged me,not to take this trip out here to this -- to be here.,I haven't given a talk in nearly four months.,And when you speak as much as I do,,three or four times a day,,you get rusty.,That's the reason I'm using this podium,and using these notes.,Every time you ever hear me on the television or somewhere,,I'm ad-libbing.,I'm not reading. I never read an address.,I never read a speech or a talk or a lecture.,I talk ad lib.,But tonight, I've,got some notes here so that if,I begin to forget,,which I do sometimes,,I've got something I can turn to. 
 But even here among us,,most --,in the most advanced society in the world,,we have poverty.,We have families that self-destruct,,friends that betray us.,Unbearable psychological pressures bear down on us.,I've never met a person in the world,that didn't have a problem,or a worry.,Why do we suffer? It's an age-old question,that we haven't answered.,Yet David again and again said,that he would turn to God.,He said, "The Lord is my shepherd.",The final problem that David knew he could not solve,was death.,Many commentators have said that death,is the forbidden subject of our generation.,Most people live as if,they're never going to die.,Technology projects the myth,of control over our mortality.,We see people on our screens.,Marilyn Monroe is just as beautiful on the screen,as she was in person,,and our -- many young people think she's still alive.,They don't know that she's dead.,Or Clark Gable, or whoever it is.,The old stars, they come to life.,And they're --,they're just as great on that screen as they were in person.,But death is inevitable. 
 I spoke some time ago to,a joint session of Congress, last year.,And we were meeting in that room,,the statue room.,About 300 of them were there.,And I said, "There's one thing that we have in common in this room,,all of us together, whether Republican or Democrat,,or whoever.",I said, "We're all going to die.,And we have that in common with all these great men of the past,that are staring down at us.",And it's often difficult for young people,to understand that.,It's difficult for them to understand that they're going to die.,As the ancient writer of Ecclesiastes wrote,,he said, there's every activity under heaven.,There's a time to be born,,and there's a time to die.,I've stood at the deathbed,of several famous people,,whom you would know.,I've talked to them.,I've seen them in those agonizing moments,when they were scared to death. 
 And yet, a few years earlier,,death never crossed their mind.,I talked to a woman this past week,whose father,was a famous doctor.,She said he never thought of God, never talked about God,,didn't believe in God. He was an atheist.,But she said,,as he came to die,,he sat up on the side of the bed one day,,and he asked the nurse if he could see the chaplain.,And he said, for the first time in his life,he'd thought about the inevitable,,and about God.,Was there a God?,A few years ago, a university student asked me,,"What is the greatest surprise in your life?",And I said, "The greatest surprise in my life,is the brevity of life.,It passes so fast.",But it does not need to have to be that way.,Wernher von Braun,,in the aftermath of World War II concluded, quote:,"science and religion are not antagonists.,On the contrary, they're sisters.",He put it on a personal basis.,I knew Dr. von Braun very well.,And he said, "Speaking for myself,,I can only say that the grandeur of the cosmos,serves only to confirm,a belief in the certainty of a creator.",He also said,,"In our search to know God,,I've come to believe that the life of Jesus Christ,should be the focus of our efforts and inspiration.,The reality of this life and His resurrection,is the hope of mankind." 
 I've done a lot of speaking in Germany,and in France, and in different parts of the world --,105 countries it's been my privilege to speak in.,And I was invited one day to visit,Chancellor Adenauer,,who was looked upon as sort of the founder of modern Germany,,since the war.,And he once -- and he said to me,,he said, "Young man." He said,,"Do you believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ?",And I said, "Sir, I do.",He said, "So do I.",He said, "When I leave office,,I'm going to spend my time writing a book,on why Jesus Christ rose again,,and why it's so important to believe that.",In one of his plays,,Alexander Solzhenitsyn,depicts a man dying,,who says to those gathered around his bed,,"The moment when it's terrible to feel regret,is when one is dying.",How should one live in order not to feel regret when one is dying? 
 Blaise Pascal,asked exactly that question,in seventeenth-century France.,Pascal has been called the architect,of modern civilization.,He was a brilliant scientist,at the frontiers of mathematics,,even as a teenager.,He is viewed by many as the founder of the probability theory,,and a creator of the first model of a computer.,And of course, you are all familiar with,the computer language named for him.,Pascal explored in depth our human dilemmas,of evil, suffering and death.,He was astounded,at the phenomenon we've been considering:,that people can achieve extraordinary heights,in science, the arts and human enterprise,,yet they also are full of anger, hypocrisy,and have -- and self-hatreds.,Pascal saw us as a remarkable mixture,of genius and self-delusion.,On November 23,,1654,,Pascal had a profound religious experience.,He wrote in his journal these words:,"I submit myself,,absolutely,,to Jesus Christ, my redeemer." 
 A French historian said,,two centuries later,,"Seldom has so mighty an intellect,submitted with such humility,to the authority of Jesus Christ.",Pascal came to believe not only the love and the grace of God,could bring us back into harmony,,but he believed,that his own sins and failures could be forgiven,,and that when he died he would go to a place called heaven.,He experienced it in a way that went beyond,scientific observation and reason.,It was he who penned the well-known words,,"The heart has its reasons,,which reason knows not of." 
 Equally well known is Pascal's Wager.,Essentially, he said this: "if you bet on God,,and open yourself to his love,,you lose nothing, even if you're wrong.,But if instead you bet that there is no God,,then you can lose it all, in this life and the life to come.",For Pascal, scientific knowledge,paled beside the knowledge of God.,The knowledge of God was far beyond,anything that ever crossed his mind.,He was ready to face him,when he died at the age of 39.,King David lived to be 70,,a long time in his era.,Yet he too had to face death,,and he wrote these words:,"even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,,I will fear no evil,,for you are with me." 
 This was David's answer to three dilemmas,of evil, suffering and death.,It can be yours, as well,,as you seek the living God,and allow him to fill your life,and give you hope for the future.,When I was 17 years of age,,I was born and reared on a farm in North Carolina.,I milked cows every morning, and I had to milk the same cows every evening,when I came home from school.,And there were 20 of them that I had --,that I was responsible for,,and I worked on the farm,and tried to keep up with my studies.,I didn't make good grades in high school.,I didn't make them in college, until,something happened in my heart. 
 One day, I was faced face-to-face,with Christ.,He said, "I am the way, the truth and the life.",Can you imagine that? "I am the truth.,I'm the embodiment of all truth.",He was a liar.,Or he was insane.,Or he was what he claimed to be.,Which was he?,I had to make that decision.,I couldn't prove it.,I couldn't take it to a laboratory,and experiment with it.,But by faith I said, I believe him,,and he came into my heart,and changed my life.,And now I'm ready,,when I hear that call,,to go into the presence of God.,Thank you, and God bless all of you. 
 (Applause) 
 Thank you for the privilege. It was great. 
 Richard Wurman: You did it.,Thanks. 
 (Applause)Back in 1992, I started working for a company,called Interval Research,,which was just then being founded,by David Lidell and Paul Allen,as a for-profit research enterprise in Silicon Valley. 
 I met with David,to talk about what I might do in his company.,I was just coming out of a failed virtual reality business,and supporting myself by being on the speaking circuit,and writing books --,after twenty years or so in the computer game industry,having ideas that people didn't think they could sell. 
 And David and I discovered,that we had a question in common,,that we really wanted the answer to,,and that was,,"Why hasn't anybody built any computer games for little girls?",Why is that?,It can't just be a giant sexist conspiracy.,These people aren't that smart.,There's six billion dollars on the table.,They would go for it if they could figure out how. 
 So, what is the deal here?,And as we thought about our goals --,I should say that Interval is really a humanistic institution,,in the classical sense,that humanism, at its best,,finds a way to combine clear-eyed empirical research,with a set of core values,that fundamentally love and respect people.,The basic idea of humanism,is the improvable quality of life;,that we can do good things,,that there are things worth doing,because they're good things to do,,and that clear-eyed empiricism,can help us figure out how to do them. 
 So, contrary to popular belief,,there is not a conflict of interest between empiricism and values.,And Interval Research is kind of the living example,of how that can be true.,So David and I decided to go find out,,through the best research we could muster,,what it would take to get a little girl,to put her hands on a computer,,to achieve the level of comfort and ease with the technology,that little boys have because they play video games. 
 We spent two and a half years conducting research;,we spent another year and a half in advance development.,Then we formed a spin-off company.,In the research phase of the project at Interval,,we partnered with a company called Cheskin Research,,and these people -- Davis Masten and Christopher Ireland --,changed my mind entirely about what market research was,and what it could be.,They taught me how to look and see,,and they did not do the incredibly stupid thing,of saying to a child,,"Of all these things we already make you,,which do you like best?" --,which gives you zero answers that are usable. 
 So, what we did for the first two and a half years,was four things:,We did an extensive review of the literature,in related fields, like cognitive psychology,,spatial cognition, gender studies,,play theory, sociology, primatology.,Thank you Frans de Waal, wherever you are,,I love you and I'd give anything to meet you. 
 After we had done that with a pretty large team of people,and discovered what we thought the salient issues were,with girls and boys and playing --,because, after all, that's really what this is about --,we moved to the second phase of our work,,where we interviewed adult experts,in academia, some of the people,who'd produced the literature that we found relevant.,Also, we did focus groups with people who were on the ground with kids every day,,like playground supervisors. We talked to them,,confirmed some hypotheses and identified some serious questions,about gender difference and play. 
 Then we did what I consider to be the heart of the work:,interviewed 1,100 children, boys and girls,,ages seven to 12, all over the United States --,except for Silicon Valley, Boston and Austin,because we knew that their little families would have millions of computers in them,and they wouldn't be a representative sample. 
 And at the end of those remarkable conversations,with kids and their best friends across the United States,,after two years, we pulled together some survey data from another 10,000 children,,drew up a set up of what we thought were the key findings of our research,,and spent another year transforming them into design heuristics,,for designing computer-based products --,and, in fact, any kind of products -- for little girls, ages eight to 12.,And we spent that time designing interactive prototypes for computer software,and testing them with little girls.,In 1996, in November, we formed the company Purple Moon,which was a spinoff of Interval Research,,and our chief investors were Interval Research, Vulcan Northwest,,Institutional Venture Partners and Allen and Company. 
 We launched a website on September 2nd,that has now served 25 million pages,,and has 42,000 registered young girl users.,They visit an average of one and a half times a day,,spend an average of 35 minutes a visit,,and look at 50 pages a visit.,So we feel that we've formed a successful online community with girls. 
 We launched two titles in October --,"Rockett's New School" -- the first of a series,of products -- is about a character called Rockett beginning her first day of school,in eighth grade at a brand new place, with a blank slate,,which allows girls to play with the question of, "What will I be like when I'm older?","What's it going to be like to be in high school or junior high school?,Who are my friends?";,to exercise the love of social complexity,and the narrative intelligence that drives most of their play behavior;,and which embeds in it values about noticing that we have lots of choices,in our lives and the ways that we conduct ourselves. 
 The other title that we launched is called "Secret Paths in the Forest,",which addresses the more fantasy-oriented, inner lives of girls.,These two titles both showed up in the top 50 entertainment titles in PC Data --,entertainment titles in PC Data,in December, right up there with "John Madden Football,",which thrills me to death.,So, we're real,,and we've touched several hundreds of thousands of little girls.,We've made half-a-billion impressions,with marketing and PR for this brand, Purple Moon.,Ninety-six percent of them, roughly, have been positive;,four percent of them have been "other.",I want to talk about the other,,because the politics of this enterprise, in a way,,have been the most fascinating part of it, for me. 
 There are really two kinds of negative reviews that we've received.,One kind of reviewer is a male gamer,who thinks he knows what games ought to be,,and won't show the product to little girls.,The other kind of reviewer is a certain flavor of feminist,who thinks they know what little girls ought to be.,And so it's funny to me that these interesting, odd bedfellows,have one thing in common:,they don't listen to little girls.,They haven't looked at children,and they're certainly not demonstrating any love for them.,I'd like to play you some voices of little girls,from the two-and-a-half years of research that we did --,actually, some of the voices are more recent.,And these voices will be accompanied by photographs,that they took for us of their lives,,of the things that they value and care about.,These are pictures the girls themselves never saw, but they gave to us,This is the stuff those reviewers don't know about and aren't listening to,and this is the kind of research I recommend to those,who want to do humanistic work. 
 Girl 1: Yeah, my character is usually a tomboy.,Hers is more into boys. 
 Girl 2: Uh, yeah. 
 Girl 1: We have -- in the very beginning of the whole game, always we do this:,we each have a piece of paper; we write down our name, our age --,are we rich, very rich, not rich, poor, medium, wealthy,,boyfriends, dogs, pets -- what else -- sisters, brothers, and all those. 
 Girl 2: Divorced -- parents divorced, maybe. 
 Girl 3: This is my pretend [unclear] one. 
 Girl 4: We make a school newspaper on the computer. 
 Girl 5: For a girl's game also usually they'll have really pretty scenery,with clouds and flowers.,Girl 6: Like, if you were a girl and you were really adventurous and a real big tomboy,,you would think that girls' games were kinda sissy. 
 Girl 7: I run track, I played soccer,,I play basketball, and I love a lot of things to do.,And sometimes I feel like I can't really enjoy myself unless it's like a vacation,,like when I get Mondays and all those days off. 
 Girl 8: Well, sometimes there is a lot of stuff going on,because I have music lessons and I'm on swim team --,all this different stuff that I have to do,,and sometimes it gets overwhelming.,Girl 9: My friend Justine,kinda took my friend Kelly, and now they're being mean to me. 
 Girl 10: Well, sometimes it gets annoying when your brothers and sisters,,or brother or sister, when they copy you and you get your idea first,and they take your idea and they do it themselves. 
 Girl 11: Because my older sister, she gets everything,and, like, when I ask my mom for something, she'll say, "No" -- all the time.,But she gives my sister everything. 
 Brenda Laurel: I want to show you, real quickly, just a minute,of "Rockett's Tricky Decision," which went gold two days ago.,Let's hope it's really stable.,This is the second day in Rockett's life.,The reason I'm showing you this,is I'm hoping that the scene that I'm going to show you will look familiar,and sound familiar, now that you've listened to some girls' voices.,And you can see how we've tried to incorporate the issues that matter to them,in the game that we've created. 
 Miko: Hey Rockett! C'mere! 
 Rockett: Hi Miko! What's going on? 
 Miko: Did you hear about Nakilia's big Halloween party this weekend?,She asked me to make sure you knew about it.,Nakilia invited Reuben too, but -- 
 Rockett: But what? Isn't he coming? 
 Miko: I don't think so.,I mean, I heard his band is playing at another party the same night. 
 Rockett: Really? What other party? 
 Girl: Max's party is going to be so cool, Whitney.,He's invited all the best people. 
 BL: I'm going to fast-forward to the decision point,because I know I don't have a lot of time.,After this awful event occurs, Rocket gets to decide how she feels about it. 
 Rockett: Who'd want to show up at that party anyway?,I could get invited to that party any day if I wanted to.,Gee, I doubt I'll make Max's best people list. 
 BL: OK, so we're going to emotionally navigate.,If we were playing the game, that's what we'd do.,If at any time during the game we want to learn more about the characters,,we can go into this hidden hallway,,and I'll quickly just show you the interface.,We can, for example, go find Miko's locker,and get some more information about her.,Oops, I turned the wrong way.,But you get the general idea of the product. 
 I wanted to show you the ways, innocuous as they seem,,in which we're incorporating what we've learned about girls --,their desires to experience greater emotional flexibility,,and to play around with the social complexity of their lives.,I want to make the point that what we're giving girls, I think, through this effort,,is a kind of validation,,a sense of being seen.,And a sense of the choices that are available in their lives.,We love them.,We see them.,We're not trying to tell them who they ought to be.,But we're really, really happy about who they are.,It turns out they're really great. 
 I want to close by showing you a videotape,that's a version of a future game in the Rockett series,that our graphic artists and design people put together,,that we feel would please that four percent of reviewers.,"Rockett 28!" 
 Rockett: It's like I'm just waking up, you know? 
 BL: Thanks.'Theme and variations' is one of those forms that,require a certain kind of intellectual activity,,because you are always comparing the variation,with the theme that you hold in your mind.,You might say that the theme is nature,and everything that follows is a variation on the subject. 
 I was asked, I guess about six years ago,,to do a series of paintings,that in some way would celebrate the birth of Piero della Francesca.,And it was very difficult for me to imagine,how to paint pictures that were based on Piero,until I realized that I could look at Piero as nature --,that I would have the same attitude towards looking at Piero della Francesca,as I would if I were looking out a window at a tree.,And that was enormously liberating to me.,Perhaps it's not a very insightful observation,,but that really started me on a path to be able to do a kind of theme and variations 
 based on a work by Piero,,in this case that remarkable painting that's in the Uffizi, "The Duke of Montefeltro,",who faces his consort, Battista.,Once I realized that I could take some liberties with the subject,,I did the following series of drawings.,That's the real Piero della Francesca --,one of the greatest portraits in human history.,And these, I'll just show these without comment.,It's just a series of variations on the head of the Duke of Montefeltro,,who's a great, great figure in the Renaissance,,and probably the basis for Machiavelli's "The Prince.",He apparently lost an eye in battle,,which is why he is always shown in profile.,And this is Battista. 
 And then I decided I could move them around a little bit --,so that for the first time in history, they're facing the same direction.,Whoops! Passed each other.,And then a visitor from another painting by Piero,,this is from "The Resurrection of Christ" --,as though the cast had just gotten of the set to have a chat.,And now, four large panels:,this is upper left;,upper right;,lower left;,lower right.,Incidentally, I've never understood the conflict between abstraction and naturalism.,Since all paintings are inherently abstract to begin with,there doesn't seem to be an argument there. 
 On another subject -- 
 (Laughter) -- 
 I was driving in the country one day with my wife,,and I saw this sign,,and I said, "That is a fabulous piece of design.",And she said, "What are you talking about?",I said, "Well, it's so persuasive,,because the purpose of that sign is to get you into the garage,,and since most people are so suspicious of garages,,and know that they're going to be ripped off,,they use the word 'reliable.',But everybody says they're reliable.,But, reliable Dutchman" -- 
 (Laughter) -- 
 "Fantastic!",Because as soon as you hear the word Dutchman --,which is an archaic word, nobody calls Dutch people "Dutchmen" anymore --,but as soon as you hear Dutchman,,you get this picture of the kid with his finger in the dike,,preventing the thing from falling and flooding Holland, and so on.,And so the entire issue is detoxified by the use of "Dutchman.",Now, if you think I'm exaggerating at all in this,,all you have to do is substitute something else, like "Indonesian." 
 (Laughter) 
 Or even "French." 
 (Laughter) 
 Now, "Swiss" works, but you know it's going to cost a lot of money. 
 (Laughter) 
 I'm going to take you quickly through the actual process of doing a poster.,I do a lot of work for the School of Visual Arts, where I teach,,and the director of this school -- a remarkable man named Silas Rhodes --,often gives you a piece of text and he says, "Do something with this.",And so he did.,And this was the text -- "In words as fashion the same rule will hold/,Alike fantastic if too new or old/,Be not the first by whom the new are tried/,Nor yet the last to lay the old aside.",I could make nothing of that.,And I really struggled with this one.,And the first thing I did, which was sort of in the absence of another idea,,was say I'll sort of write it out and make some words big,,and I'll have some kind of design on the back somehow,,and I was hoping -- as one often does -- to stumble into something.,So I took another crack at it --,you've got to keep it moving --,and I Xeroxed some words on pieces of colored paper,and I pasted them down on an ugly board.,I thought that something would come out of it,,like "Words rule fantastic new old first last Pope",because it's by Alexander Pope,,but I sort of made a mess out of it,,and then I thought I'd repeat it in some way so it was legible.,So, it was going nowhere. 
 Sometimes, in the middle of a resistant problem,,I write down things that I know about it.,But you can see the beginning of an idea there,,because you can see the word "new" emerging from the "old.",That's what happens.,There's a relationship between the old and the new;,the new emerges from the context of the old.,And then I did some variations of it,,but it still wasn't coalescing graphically at all.,I had this other version which had something interesting about it,in terms of being able to put it together in your mind from clues.,The W was clearly a W, the N was clearly an N,,even though they were very fragmentary,and there wasn't a lot of information in it.,Then I got the words "new" and "old",and now I had regressed back to a point where there seemed to be no return. 
 (Laughter) 
 I was really desperate at this point. 
 And so, I do something I'm truthfully ashamed of,,which is that I took two drawings I had made for another purpose,and I put them together.,It says "dreams" at the top.,And I was going to do a thing, I say, "Well, change the copy.,Let it say something about dreams, and come to SVA,and you'll sort of fulfill your dreams.",But, to my credit,,I was so embarrassed about doing that,that I never submitted this sketch.,And, finally, I arrived at the following solution.,Now, it doesn't look terribly interesting,,but it does have something,that distinguishes it from a lot of other posters.,For one thing, it transgresses the idea of what a poster's supposed to be,,which is to be understood and seen immediately, and not explained.,I remember hearing all of you in the graphic arts --,"If you have to explain it, it ain't working.",And one day I woke up and I said, "Well, suppose that's not true?" 
 (Laughter) 
 So here's what it says in my explanation at the bottom left.,It says, "Thoughts: This poem is impossible.,Silas usually has a better touch with his choice of quotations.,This one generates no imagery at all.",I am now exposing myself to my audience, right?,Which is something you never want to do professionally.,"Maybe the words can make the image without anything else happening.,What's the heart of this poem?,Don't be trendy if you want to be serious.,Is doing the poster this way trendy in itself? 
 I guess one could reduce the idea further,by suggesting that the new emerges behind and through the old,,like this.",And then I show you a little drawing --,you see, you remember that old thing I discarded?,Well, I found a way to use it.,So, there's that little alternative over there,,and I say, "Not bad," -- criticizing myself --,"but more didactic than visual.,Maybe what wants to be said is that old and the new are locked in a dialectical embrace,,a kind of dance where each defines the other.",And then more self-questioning -- "Am I being simple-minded?,Is this the kind of simple that looks obvious, or the kind that looks profound?,There's a significant difference.,This could be embarrassing.,Actually, I realize fear of embarrassment drives me as much as any ambition.,Do you think this sort of thing could really attract a student to the school?" 
 (Laughter) 
 Well, I think there are two fresh things here -- two fresh things.,One is the sort of willingness to expose myself to a critical audience,,and not to suggest that I am confident about what I'm doing.,And as you know, you have to have a front.,I mean -- you've got to be confident;,if you don't believe in your work, who else is going to believe in it?,So that's one thing,,to introduce the idea of doubt into graphics.,That can be a big contribution.,The other thing is to actually give you two solutions for the price of one;,you get the big one,and if you don't like that, how about the little one? 
 (Laughter) 
 And that too is a relatively new idea.,And here's just a series of experiments,where I ask the question of -- does a poster have to be square?,Now, this is a little illusion.,That poster is not folded.,It's not folded, that's a photograph,and it's cut on the diagonal.,Same cheap trick in the upper left-hand corner.,And here,,a very peculiar poster because,,simply because of using the isometric perspective in the computer,,it won't sit still in the space.,At times, it seems to be wider at the back than the front,,and then it shifts.,And if you sit here long enough, it'll float off the page into the audience.,But, we don't have time. 
 (Laughter) 
 And then an experiment --,a little bit about the nature of perspective,,where the outside shape is determined by the peculiarity of perspective,,but the shape of the bottle -- which is identical to the outside shape --,is seen frontally.,And another piece for the art directors' club,is "Anna Rees" casting long shadows.,This is another poster from the School of Visual Arts.,There were 10 artists invited to participate in it,,and it was one of those things where it was extremely competitive,and I didn't want to be embarrassed,,so I worked very hard on this.,The idea was -- and it was a brilliant idea --,was to have 10 posters distributed throughout the city's subway system,so every time you got on the subway you'd be passing a different poster,,all of which had a different idea of what art is. 
 But I was absolutely stuck on the idea of "art is",and trying to determine what art was.,But then I gave up and I said, "Well, art is whatever.",And as soon as I said that,,I discovered that the word "hat" was hidden in the word "whatever,",and that led me to the inevitable conclusion.,But then again, it's on my list of didactic posters.,My intent is to have a literary accompaniment that explains the poster,,in case you don't get it. 
 (Laughter) 
 Now this says, "Note to the viewer:,I thought I might use a visual cliche of our time -- Magritte's everyman --,to express the idea that art is mystery, continuity and history.,I'm also convinced that, in an age of computer manipulation,,surrealism has become banal,,a shadow of its former self.,The phrase 'Art is whatever',expresses the current inclusiveness that surrounds art-making --,a sort of 'it ain't what you do, it's the way that you do it' notion. 
 The shadow of Magritte falls across the central part of the poster,a poetic event that occurs as the shadow man isolates the word 'hat,',hidden in the word 'whatever.',The four hats shown in the poster suggests how art might be defined:,as a thing itself, the worth of the thing, the shadow of the thing,,and the shape of the thing.,Whatever." 
 (Applause) 
 OK. 
 (Applause) 
 And the one that I did not submit,,which I still like,,I wanted to use the same phrase.,There were wonderful experiments by Bruno Munari,on letterforms some years ago --,sort of, see how far you could go and still be able to read them.,And that idea stuck in my head.,But then I took the pieces that I had taken off and put them at the bottom.,And, of course those are the remains, and they're so labeled.,But what really happens is that you read it as:,"Art is whatever remains." 
 Thank you. 
 (Applause)You hear that this is the era of environment -- or biology, or information technology ...,Well, it's the era of a lot of different things,that we're in right now. But one thing for sure:,it's the era of change. There's more change going on,than ever has occurred in the history of human life on earth.,And you all sort of know it, but it's hard to get it,so that you really understand it.,And I've tried to put together something that's a good start for this.,I've tried to show in this -- though the color doesn't come out --,that what I'm concerned with is the little 50-year time bubble,that you are in. You tend to be interested in a generation past,,a generation future -- your parents, your kids, things you can change,over the next few decades -- and this 50-year time bubble,you kind of move along in. And in that 50 years,,if you look at the population curve, you find the population of humans,on the earth more than doubles and we're up three-and-a-half times,since I was born. When you have a new baby,,by the time that kid gets out of high school,more people will be added than existed on earth when I was born.,This is unprecedented, and it's big.,Where it goes in the future is questioned. So that's the human part. 
 Now, the human part related to animals: look at the left side of that.,What I call the human portion -- humans and their livestock and pets --,versus the natural portion -- all the other wild animals and just --,these are vertebrates and all the birds, etc.,,in the land and air, not in the water. How does it balance?,Certainly, 10,000 years ago, the civilization's beginning,,the human portion was less than one tenth of one percent. Let's look at it now.,You follow this curve and you see the whiter spot in the middle --,that's your 50-year time bubble. Humans, livestock and pets,are now 97 percent of that integrated total mass on earth,and all wild nature is three percent. We have won. The next generation,doesn't even have to worry about this game -- it is over.,And the biggest problem came in the last 25 years:,it went from 25 percent up to that 97 percent.,And this really is a sobering picture upon realizing that we, humans,,are in charge of life on earth; we're like the capricious Gods,of old Greek myths, kind of playing with life --,and not a great deal of wisdom injected into it. 
 Now, the third curve is information technology.,This is Moore's Law plotted here, which relates to density,of information, but it has been pretty good for showing,a lot of other things about information technology --,computers, their use, Internet, etc. And what's important,is it just goes straight up through the top of the curve,,and has no real limits to it. Now try and contrast these.,This is the size of the earth going through that same --,(Laughter),-- frame. And to make it really clear, I've put all four on one graph.,There's no need to see the little detailed words on it.,That first one is humans-versus-nature;,we've won, there's no more gain. Human population.,And so if you're looking for growth industries to get into,,that's not a good one -- protecting natural creatures. Human population,is going up; it's going to continue for quite a while.,Good business in obstetricians, morticians, and farming, housing, etc. --,they all deal with human bodies, which require being fed,,transported, housed and so on. And the information technology,,which connects to our brains, has no limit -- now, that is a wonderful,field to be in. You're looking for growth opportunity?,It's just going up through the roof.,And then, the size of the Earth. Somehow making these all compatible,with the Earth looks like a pretty bad industry to be involved with. 
 So, that's the stage out of all this. I find,,for reasons I don't understand, I really do have a goal.,And the goal is that the world be desirable and sustainable,when my kids reach my age -- and I think that's -- in other words,,the next generation. I think that's a goal that we probably all share.,I think it's a hopeless goal. Technologically, it's achievable;,economically, it's achievable; politically,,it means sort of the habits, institutions of people -- it's impossible.,The institutions of the past with all their inertia,are just irrelevant for the future, except they're there,and we have to deal with them. I spend about 15 percent of my time,trying to save the world, the other 85 percent, the usual --,and whatever else we devote ourselves to.,And in that 15 percent, the main focus is on human mind, thinking skills,,somehow trying to unleash kids from the straightjacket of school,,which is putting information and dogma into them,,get them so they really think, ask tough questions, argue,about serious subjects, don't believe everything that's in the book,,think broadly or creative. They can be.,Our school systems are very flawed and do not reward you,for the things that are important in life,or for the survival of civilization; they reward you,for a lot of learning and sopping up stuff.,We can't go into that today because there isn't time --,it's a broad subject. One thing for sure, in the future,there is an essential feature -- necessary, but not sufficient --,which is doing more with less. We've got to be doing things,with more efficiency using less energy, less material.,Your great-great grandparents got by on muscle power,,and yet we all think there's this huge power that's essential,for our lifestyle. And with all the wonderful technology we have,we can do things that are much more efficient: conserve, recycle, etc. 
 Let me just rush very quickly through things that we've done.,Human-powered airplane -- Gossamer Condor sort of started me,in this direction in 1976 and 77,,winning the Kremer prize in aviation history,,followed by the Albatross. And we began,making various odd planes and creatures.,Here's a giant flying replica of a pterosaur that has no tail.,Trying to have it fly straight is like trying to shoot an arrow,with the feathered end forward. It was a tough job,,and boy it made me have a lot of respect for nature.,This was the full size of the original creature.,We did things on land, in the air, on water --,vehicles of all different kinds, usually with some electronics,or electric power systems in them. I find they're all the same,,whether its land, air or water.,I'll be focusing on the air here. This is a solar-powered airplane --,165 miles carrying a person from France to England,as a symbol that solar power is going to be an important part,of our future. Then we did the solar car for General Motors --,the Sunracer -- that won the race in Australia.,We got a lot of people thinking about electric cars,,what you could do with them. A few years later, when we suggested to GM that,now is the time and we could do a thing called the Impact,,they sponsored it, and here's the Impact that we developed with them,on their programs. This is the demonstrator. And they put huge effort,into turning it into a commercial product. 
 With that preamble, let's show the first two-minute videotape,,which shows a little airplane for surveillance,and moving to a giant airplane.,Narrator: A tiny airplane, the AV Pointer serves for surveillance --,in effect, a pair of roving eyeglasses. A cutting-edge example,of where miniaturization can lead if the operator is remote,from the vehicle. It is convenient to carry, assemble,and launch by hand. Battery-powered, it is silent and rarely noticed.,It sends high-resolution video pictures back to the operator.,With onboard GPS, it can navigate autonomously,,and it is rugged enough to self-land without damage.,The modern sailplane is superbly efficient.,Some can glide as flat as 60 feet forward for every foot of descent.,They are powered only by the energy,they can extract from the atmosphere --,an atmosphere nature stirs up by solar energy.,Humans and soaring birds have found nature to be generous,in providing replenishable energy. Sailplanes have flown,over 1,000 miles, and the altitude record is over 50,000 feet.,(Music),The Solar Challenger was made to serve as a symbol,that photovoltaic cells can produce real power,and will be part of the world's energy future.,In 1981, it flew 163 miles from Paris to England,,solely on the power of sunbeams,,and established a basis for the Pathfinder.,(Music),The message from all these vehicles is that ideas and technology,can be harnessed to produce remarkable gains in doing more with less --,gains that can help us attain a desirable balance,between technology and nature. The stakes are high,as we speed toward a challenging future.,Buckminster Fuller said it clearly: "there are no passengers,on spaceship Earth, only crew. We, the crew,,can and must do more with less -- much less." 
 Paul MacCready: If we could have the second video, the one-minute,,put in as quickly as you can, which -- this will show,the Pathfinder airplane in some flights this past year in Hawaii,,and will show a sequence of some of the beauty behind it,after it had just flown to 71,530 feet --,higher than any propeller airplane has ever flown.,It's amazing: just on the puny power of the sun --,by having a super lightweight plane, you're able to get it up there.,It's part of a long-term program NASA sponsored.,And we worked very closely with the whole thing being a team effort,,and with wonderful results like that flight.,And we're working on a bigger plane -- 220-foot span --,and an intermediate-size, one with a regenerative fuel cell,that can store excess energy during the day, feed it back at night,,and stay up 65,000 feet for months at a time.,(Music),Ray Morgan's voice will come in here.,There he's the project manager. Anything they do,is certainly a team effort. He ran this program. Here's ...,some things he showed as a celebration at the very end.,Ray Morgan: We'd just ended a seven-month deployment of Hawaii.,For those who live on the mainland, it was tough being away from home.,The friendly support, the quiet confidence, congenial hospitality,shown by our Hawaiian and military hosts --,(Music),this is starting --,made the experience enjoyable and unforgettable.,PM: We have real-time IR scans going out through the Internet,while the plane is flying. And it's exploring,without polluting the stratosphere. That's its goal: the stratosphere,,the blanket that really controls the radiation of the earth,and permits life on earth to be the success that it is --,probing that is very important. And also we consider it,as a sort of poor man's stationary satellite,,because it can stay right overhead for months at a time,,2,000 times closer than the real GFC synchronous satellite.,We couldn't bring one here to fly it and show you. 
 But now let's look at the other end.,In the video you saw that nine-pound or eight-pound Pointer airplane,surveillance drone that Keenan has developed,and just done a remarkable job. Where some have servos,that have gotten down to, oh, 18 or 25 grams,,his weigh one-third of a gram. And what he's going to bring out here,is a surveillance drone that weighs about 2 ounces --,that includes the video camera, the batteries that run it,,the telemetry, the receiver and so on. And we'll fly it, we hope,,with the same success that we had last night when we did the practice.,So Matt Keenan, just any time you're --,all right,-- ready to let her go. But first, we're going to make sure,that it's appearing on the screen, so you see what it sees.,You can imagine yourself being a mouse or fly inside of it,,looking out of its camera.,Matt Keenan: It's switched on.,PM: But now we're trying to get the video. There we go.,MK: Can you bring up the house lights?,PM: Yeah, the house lights and we'll see you all better,and be able to fly the plane better.,MK: All right, we'll try to do a few laps around and bring it back in.,Here we go.,(Applause),PM: The video worked right for the first few and I don't know why it --,there it goes.,Oh, that was only a minute, but I think you'd be safe,to have that near the end of the flight, perhaps.,We get to do the classic.,All right.,If this hits you, it will not hurt you.,(Laughter),OK.,(Applause),Thank you very much. Thank you.,(Applause) 
 But now, as they say in infomercials,,we have something much better for you, which we're working on:,planes that are only six inches -- 15 centimeters -- in size.,And Matt's plane was on the cover of Popular Science last month,,showing what this can lead to. And in a while, something this size,will have GPS and a video camera in it. We've had one of these fly,nine miles through the air at 35 miles an hour,with just a little battery in it.,But there's a lot of technology going.,There are just milestones along the way of some remarkable things.,This one doesn't have the video in it,,but you get a little feel from what it can do.,OK, here we go.,(Laughter),MK: Sorry.,OK.,(Applause),PM: If you can pass it down when you're done. Yeah, I think --,I lost a little orientation; I looked up into this light.,It hit the building. And the building was poorly placed, actually.,(Laughter),But you're beginning to see what can be done.,We're working on projects now -- even wing-flapping things,the size of hawk moths -- DARPA contracts, working with Caltech, UCLA. 
 Where all this leads, I don't know. Is it practical? I don't know.,But like any basic research, when you're really forced to do things,that are way beyond existing technology,,you can get there with micro-technology, nanotechnology.,You can do amazing things when you realize,what nature has been doing all along. As you get to these small scales,,you realize we have a lot to learn from nature -- not with 747s --,but when you get down to the nature's realm,,nature has 200 million years of experience.,It never makes a mistake. Because if you make a mistake,,you don't leave any progeny.,We should have nothing but success stories from nature,,for you or for birds, and we're learning a lot,from its fascinating subjects. 
 In concluding, I want to get back to the big picture,and I have just two final slides to try and put it in perspective.,The first I'll just read. At last, I put in three sentences,and had it say what I wanted.,Over billions of years on a unique sphere, chance has painted,a thin covering of life -- complex, improbable, wonderful,and fragile. Suddenly, we humans -- a recently arrived species,,no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature --,have grown in population, technology and intelligence,to a position of terrible power. We now wield the paintbrush.,And that's serious: we're not very bright. We're short on wisdom;,we're high on technology. Where's it going to lead? 
 Well, inspired by the sentences, I decided to wield the paintbrush.,Every 25 years I do a picture. Here's the one --,tries to show that the world isn't getting any bigger.,Sort of a timeline, very non-linear scale, nature rates,and trilobites and dinosaurs, and eventually we saw some humans,with caves ... Birds were flying overhead, after pterosaurs.,And then we get to the civilization above the little TV set,with a gun on it. Then traffic jams, and power systems,,and some dots for digital. Where it's going to lead -- I have no idea.,And so I just put robotic and natural cockroaches out there,,but you can fill in whatever you want. This is not a forecast.,This is a warning, and we have to think seriously about it.,And that time when this is happening is not 100 years or 500 years.,Things are going on this decade, next decade;,it's a very short time that we have to decide what we are going to do.,And if we can get some agreement on where we want the world to be --,desirable, sustainable when your kids reach your age --,I think we actually can reach it. Now, I said this was a warning,,not a forecast. That was before --,I painted this before we started in on making robotic versions,of hawk moths and cockroaches, and now I'm beginning to wonder,seriously -- was this more of a forecast than I wanted?,I personally think the surviving intelligent life form on earth,is not going to be carbon-based; it's going to be silicon-based.,And so where it all goes, I don't know. 
 The one final bit of sparkle we'll put in at the very end here,is an utterly impractical flight vehicle,,which is a little ornithopter wing-flapping device that --,rubber-band powered -- that we'll show you.,MK: 32 gram. Sorry, one gram.,PM: Last night we gave it a few too many turns,and it tried to bash the roof out also. It's about a gram.,The tube there's hollow, about paper-thin.,And if this lands on you, I assure you it will not hurt you.,But if you reach out to grab it or hold it, you will destroy it.,So, be gentle, just act like a wooden Indian or something.,And when it comes down -- and we'll see how it goes.,We consider this to be sort of the spirit of TED.,(Applause),And you wonder, is it practical? And it turns out if I had not been --,(Laughter),(Applause),Unfortunately, we have some light bulb changes.,We can probably get it down,,but it's possible it's gone up to a greater destiny up there --,(Laughter),-- than it ever had. And I wanted to make --,(Applause),just --,(Applause) 
 But I want to make just two points. One is, you think it's frivolous;,there's nothing to it. And yet if I had not been making ornithopters,like that, a little bit cruder, in 1939 -- a long, long time ago --,there wouldn't have been a Gossamer Condor,,there wouldn't have been an Albatross, a Solar Challenger,,there wouldn't be an Impact car, there wouldn't be a mandate,on zero-emission vehicles in California.,A lot of these things -- or similar -- would have happened some time,,probably a decade later. I didn't realize at the time,I was doing inquiry-based, hands-on things with teams,,like they're trying to get in education systems.,So I think that, as a symbol, it's important.,And I believe that also is important. You can think of it,as a sort of a symbol for learning and TED,that somehow gets you thinking of technology and nature,,and puts it all together in things that are --,that make this conference, I think, more important than any,that's taken place in this country in this decade.,Thank you. (Applause)(Applause),David Gallo: This is Bill Lange. I'm Dave Gallo.,And we're going to tell you some stories from the sea here in video.,We've got some of the most incredible video of Titanic that's ever been seen,,and we're not going to show you any of it.,(Laughter) 
 The truth of the matter is that the Titanic --,even though it's breaking all sorts of box office records --,it's not the most exciting story from the sea.,And the problem, I think, is that we take the ocean for granted.,When you think about it, the oceans are 75 percent of the planet.,Most of the planet is ocean water.,The average depth is about two miles.,Part of the problem, I think, is we stand at the beach,,or we see images like this of the ocean,,and you look out at this great big blue expanse, and it's shimmering,and it's moving and there's waves and there's surf and there's tides,,but you have no idea for what lies in there.,And in the oceans, there are the longest mountain ranges on the planet.,Most of the animals are in the oceans.,Most of the earthquakes and volcanoes are in the sea,,at the bottom of the sea.,The biodiversity and the biodensity in the ocean is higher, in places,,than it is in the rainforests.,It's mostly unexplored, and yet there are beautiful sights like this,that captivate us and make us become familiar with it. 
 But when you're standing at the beach, I want you to think,that you're standing at the edge of a very unfamiliar world.,We have to have a very special technology,to get into that unfamiliar world.,We use the submarine Alvin and we use cameras,,and the cameras are something that Bill Lange has developed with the help of Sony.,Marcel Proust said, "The true voyage of discovery,is not so much in seeking new landscapes as in having new eyes.",People that have partnered with us have given us new eyes,,not only on what exists --,the new landscapes at the bottom of the sea --,but also how we think about life on the planet itself. 
 Here's a jelly.,It's one of my favorites, because it's got all sorts of working parts.,This turns out to be the longest creature in the oceans.,It gets up to about 150 feet long.,But see all those different working things?,I love that kind of stuff.,It's got these fishing lures on the bottom. They're going up and down.,It's got tentacles dangling, swirling around like that.,It's a colonial animal.,These are all individual animals,banding together to make this one creature.,And it's got these jet thrusters up in front,that it'll use in a moment, and a little light.,If you take all the big fish and schooling fish and all that,,put them on one side of the scale, put all the jelly-type of animals,on the other side, those guys win hands down. 
 Most of the biomass in the ocean is made out of creatures like this.,Here's the X-wing death jelly.,(Laughter),The bioluminescence -- they use the lights for attracting mates,and attracting prey and communicating.,We couldn't begin to show you our archival stuff from the jellies.,They come in all different sizes and shapes. 
 Bill Lange: We tend to forget about the fact that the ocean is miles deep,on average, and that we're real familiar with the animals,that are in the first 200 or 300 feet, but we're not familiar,with what exists from there all the way down to the bottom.,And these are the types of animals,that live in that three-dimensional space,,that micro-gravity environment that we really haven't explored.,You hear about giant squid and things like that,,but some of these animals get up to be approximately 140, 160 feet long.,They're very little understood. 
 DG: This is one of them, another one of our favorites, because it's a little octopod.,You can actually see through his head.,And here he is, flapping with his ears and very gracefully going up.,We see those at all depths and even at the greatest depths.,They go from a couple of inches to a couple of feet.,They come right up to the submarine --,they'll put their eyes right up to the window and peek inside the sub. 
 This is really a world within a world,,and we're going to show you two.,In this case, we're passing down through the mid-ocean and we see creatures like this.,This is kind of like an undersea rooster.,This guy, that looks incredibly formal, in a way.,And then one of my favorites. What a face!,This is basically scientific data that you're looking at.,It's footage that we've collected for scientific purposes.,And that's one of the things that Bill's been doing,,is providing scientists with this first view of animals like this,,in the world where they belong.,They don't catch them in a net.,They're actually looking at them down in that world.,We're going to take a joystick,,sit in front of our computer, on the Earth,,and press the joystick forward, and fly around the planet. 
 We're going to look at the mid-ocean ridge,,a 40,000-mile long mountain range.,The average depth at the top of it is about a mile and a half.,And we're over the Atlantic -- that's the ridge right there --,but we're going to go across the Caribbean, Central America,,and end up against the Pacific, nine degrees north.,We make maps of these mountain ranges with sound, with sonar,,and this is one of those mountain ranges.,We're coming around a cliff here on the right.,The height of these mountains on either side of this valley,is greater than the Alps in most cases.,And there's tens of thousands of those mountains out there that haven't been mapped yet. 
 This is a volcanic ridge.,We're getting down further and further in scale.,And eventually, we can come up with something like this. 
 This is an icon of our robot, Jason, it's called.,And you can sit in a room like this,,with a joystick and a headset, and drive a robot like that,around the bottom of the ocean in real time.,One of the things we're trying to do at Woods Hole with our partners,is to bring this virtual world --,this world, this unexplored region -- back to the laboratory.,Because we see it in bits and pieces right now.,We see it either as sound, or we see it as video,,or we see it as photographs, or we see it as chemical sensors,,but we never have yet put it all together into one interesting picture. 
 Here's where Bill's cameras really do shine.,This is what's called a hydrothermal vent.,And what you're seeing here is a cloud of densely packed,,hydrogen-sulfide-rich water,coming out of a volcanic axis on the sea floor.,Gets up to 600, 700 degrees F, somewhere in that range.,So that's all water under the sea --,a mile and a half, two miles, three miles down.,And we knew it was volcanic back in the '60s, '70s.,And then we had some hint that these things existed,all along the axis of it, because if you've got volcanism,,water's going to get down from the sea into cracks in the sea floor,,come in contact with magma, and come shooting out hot.,We weren't really aware that it would be so rich with sulfides, hydrogen sulfides.,We didn't have any idea about these things, which we call chimneys. 
 This is one of these hydrothermal vents.,Six hundred degree F water coming out of the Earth.,On either side of us are mountain ranges that are higher than the Alps,,so the setting here is very dramatic. 
 BL: The white material is a type of bacteria,that thrives at 180 degrees C. 
 DG: I think that's one of the greatest stories right now,that we're seeing from the bottom of the sea,,is that the first thing we see coming out of the sea floor,after a volcanic eruption is bacteria.,And we started to wonder for a long time,,how did it all get down there?,What we find out now is that it's probably coming from inside the Earth.,Not only is it coming out of the Earth --,so, biogenesis made from volcanic activity --,but that bacteria supports these colonies of life.,The pressure here is 4,000 pounds per square inch.,A mile and a half from the surface to two miles to three miles --,no sun has ever gotten down here.,All the energy to support these life forms,is coming from inside the Earth -- so, chemosynthesis.,And you can see how dense the population is.,These are called tube worms. 
 BL: These worms have no digestive system. They have no mouth.,But they have two types of gill structures.,One for extracting oxygen out of the deep-sea water,,another one which houses this chemosynthetic bacteria,,which takes the hydrothermal fluid --,that hot water that you saw coming out of the bottom --,and converts that into simple sugars that the tube worm can digest. 
 DG: You can see, here's a crab that lives down there.,He's managed to grab a tip of these worms.,Now, they normally retract as soon as a crab touches them.,Oh! Good going.,So, as soon as a crab touches them,,they retract down into their shells, just like your fingernails.,There's a whole story being played out here,that we're just now beginning to have some idea of,because of this new camera technology. 
 BL: These worms live in a real temperature extreme.,Their foot is at about 200 degrees C,and their head is out at three degrees C,,so it's like having your hand in boiling water and your foot in freezing water.,That's how they like to live.,(Laughter) 
 DG: This is a female of this kind of worm.,And here's a male.,You watch. It doesn't take long before two guys here --,this one and one that will show up over here -- start to fight.,Everything you see is played out in the pitch black of the deep sea.,There are never any lights there, except the lights that we bring.,Here they go.,On one of the last dive series,,we counted 200 species in these areas --,198 were new, new species. 
 BL: One of the big problems is that for the biologists,working at these sites, it's rather difficult to collect these animals.,And they disintegrate on the way up,,so the imagery is critical for the science. 
 DG: Two octopods at about two miles depth.,This pressure thing really amazes me --,that these animals can exist there at a depth,with pressure enough to crush the Titanic like an empty Pepsi can.,What we saw up till now was from the Pacific.,This is from the Atlantic. Even greater depth.,You can see this shrimp is harassing this poor little guy here,,and he'll bat it away with his claw. Whack!,(Laughter) 
 And the same thing's going on over here.,What they're getting at is that -- on the back of this crab --,the foodstuff here is this very strange bacteria,that lives on the backs of all these animals.,And what these shrimp are trying to do,is actually harvest the bacteria from the backs of these animals.,And the crabs don't like it at all.,These long filaments that you see on the back of the crab,are actually created by the product of that bacteria.,So, the bacteria grows hair on the crab.,On the back, you see this again.,The red dot is the laser light of the submarine Alvin,to give us an idea about how far away we are from the vents.,Those are all shrimp.,You see the hot water over here, here and here, coming out.,They're clinging to a rock face,and actually scraping bacteria off that rock face.,Here's a tiny, little vent that's come out of the side of that pillar.,Those pillars get up to several stories.,So here, you've got this valley with this incredible alien landscape,of pillars and hot springs and volcanic eruptions and earthquakes,,inhabited by these very strange animals,that live only on chemical energy coming out of the ground.,They don't need the sun at all. 
 BL: You see this white V-shaped mark on the back of the shrimp?,It's actually a light-sensing organ.,It's how they find the hydrothermal vents.,The vents are emitting a black body radiation -- an IR signature --,and so they're able to find these vents at considerable distances. 
 DG: All this stuff is happening along that 40,000-mile long mountain range,that we're calling the ribbon of life, because just even today,,as we speak, there's life being generated there from volcanic activity.,This is the first time we've ever tried this any place.,We're going to try to show you high definition from the Pacific.,We're moving up one of these pillars.,This one's several stories tall.,In it, you'll see that it's a habitat for a lot of different animals.,There's a funny kind of hot plate here, with vent water coming out of it.,So all of these are individual homes for worms. 
 Now here's a closer view of that community.,Here's crabs here, worms here.,There are smaller animals crawling around.,Here's pagoda structures.,I think this is the neatest-looking thing.,I just can't get over this --,that you've got these little chimneys sitting here smoking away.,This stuff is toxic as hell, by the way.,You could never get a permit to dump this in the ocean,,and it's coming out all from it.,(Laughter),It's unbelievable. It's basically sulfuric acid,,and it's being just dumped out, at incredible rates.,And animals are thriving -- and we probably came from here.,That's probably where we evolved from. 
 BL: This bacteria that we've been talking about,turns out to be the most simplest form of life found.,There are a number of groups that are proposing,that life evolved at these vent sites.,Although the vent sites are short-lived --,an individual site may last only 10 years or so --,as an ecosystem they've been stable for millions -- well, billions -- of years. 
 DG: It works too well. You see there're some fish inside here as well.,There's a fish sitting here.,Here's a crab with his claw right at the end of that tube worm,,waiting for that worm to stick his head out.,(Laughter) 
 BL: The biologists right now cannot explain,why these animals are so active.,The worms are growing inches per week! 
 DG: I already said that this site,,from a human perspective, is toxic as hell.,Not only that, but on top -- the lifeblood --,that plumbing system turns off every year or so.,Their plumbing system turns off, so the sites have to move.,And then there's earthquakes,,and then volcanic eruptions, on the order of one every five years,,that completely wipes the area out.,Despite that, these animals grow back in about a year's time.,You're talking about biodensities and biodiversity, again,,higher than the rainforest that just springs back to life.,Is it sensitive? Yes.,Is it fragile? No, it's not really very fragile. 
 I'll end up with saying one thing.,There's a story in the sea, in the waters of the sea,,in the sediments and the rocks of the sea floor.,It's an incredible story.,What we see when we look back in time,,in those sediments and rocks, is a record of Earth history.,Everything on this planet -- everything -- works by cycles and rhythms.,The continents move apart. They come back together.,Oceans come and go. Mountains come and go. Glaciers come and go.,El Nino comes and goes. It's not a disaster, it's rhythmic.,What we're learning now, it's almost like a symphony.,It's just like music -- it really is just like music.,And what we're learning now is that,you can't listen to a five-billion-year long symphony, get to today and say,,"Stop! We want tomorrow's note to be the same as it was today.",It's absurd. It's just absurd.,So, what we've got to learn now is to find out where this planet's going,at all these different scales and work with it.,Learn to manage it.,The concept of preservation is futile.,Conservation's tougher, but we can probably get there.,Thank you very much.,Thank you.,(Applause)
